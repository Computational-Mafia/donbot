Be familiar with the sitewide rules and guidelines.<br>2. Personal attacks will not be tolerated. Use of homophobic, racist, sexist, or any other derogatory slurs falls under this rule. Keep it civil.<br>3. Play to your win condition.<br>4. Unless otherwise specified in your role PM or by me, you may not communicate outside of this thread while the game is running.<br>5. Do not quote or post any screen captures of any private communication to which you have access. This includes game-related PMs, QuickTopics, and instant messaging logs. Paraphrasing is okay.<br>6. If it is not visible to the naked eye, do not post it. This includes, but is not limited to: invisible text, tiny text, encrypted text, and text hidden within tags. Clickable spoiler text, however, is allowed, as long as it is used within reason.<br>7. If you have the ability to edit your posts, don't use it in my game.<br>8. <span style=\"color: #0040BF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Blue</span></span></span> is reserved for the moderator. All other formatting is fair game with the provision that you do not impersonate me or post in hidden text, as covered in another rule.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Activity</span></span><br><br>1. Prods will be issued to players if they have not posted within a 72-hour period. Players who have been prodded have 36 hours to respond in the game thread before a replacement is sought.<br>2. Players who have been prodded 3 times are subject to replacement without further notice. After three prods, replacements will happen upon my discretion. You will also be replaced if you require two prods in one Day. Prod timers re-set with each new game Day.<br>3. Posting content is an absolute must. If a player posts nothing but prod dodges for an entire game Day, he or she will be subject to replacement upon my discretion.<br>4. If you anticipate being away for at least 48 hours, please PM me AND post a V/LA notice in the thread with the expected date of your return.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Pre-Game</span></span><br><br>1. During Pre-Game you will receive your role PM. Confirm by posting in the thread.<br>2. Confirmed players will be bolded on the player list. When 7/9 players have confirmed, Day 1 will begin.<br>3. All QTs are open during pre-game.<br> <br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Day</span></span><br><br>1. Days will have a deadline of 21 real-time days for Day 1, and 14 real days for all others. Deadline extensions will be granted only in extreme circumstances.<br>2. Players may vote to No Lynch; a no lynch will occur if 50% of players vote for no lynch or if no majority is achieved by deadline.<br>3. Lynch is achieved by simple majority.<br>4. Once majority is reached, no further votes or unvotes will count.<br>5. Votes should be on a separate line and flushed left, and <span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">MUST</span></span> be bolded (e.g., <span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: Amrun</span>). The same applies to vote revocations (e.g., <span class=\"noboldsig\">Unvote</span>). Unvotes are preferred but not necessary when switching votes (e.g., <span class=\"noboldsig\">Unvote</span>, <span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: Amrun</span>). Use of the vote tags (e.g., <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Amrun</span>) is optional. Abbreviations are okay as long as it's clear for whom the vote is made.<br>6. Let me repeat. All votes/unvotes <span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">MUST</span></span> be flushed left and bolded or use the appropriate tag.<br>7. All players, including the lynched player, are allowed to discuss in twilight phase until I post the death scene.<br>8.

Please PM me for all other issues.<br>3. Violations of these rules will result in consequences. Pretending to violate these rules will also result in consequences. What those consequences are depend on the severity of the action and on the game state.<br>4. Any situation not covered above will be handled on a case-by-case basis.<br>5.

I was looking for the scummiest reaction...and you gave it to me.<br><br>Your #16 was just a whole lot of IIoA, by the way. I know what RVS is. We all know what RVS is. Why the need to explain it? Either way, the tone of your post was worried and over-serious. These are not things I see from town in RVS. Town can get serious quick in RVS (as I've done here), but they don't do it because of a whole lot of nothing, like you did. They do it because they think they're onto something.<br><br>And you should have read my meta before you claimed reaction test. Explaining away scummy actions as \"oh, it was just a reaction test! herp derp\" is probably the worst thing to do in Mafia, as scum or town, although I see scum do it MUCH more often than town. I pretty much am willing to policy lynch for it."}

Either way, the tone of your post was worried and over-serious. These are not things I see from town in RVS. Town can get serious quick in RVS (as I've done here), but they don't do it because of a whole lot of nothing, like you did. They do it because they think they're onto something.<br><br>And you should have read my meta before you claimed reaction test.

Bottom line: it's just not as easy as the Jun wagon seems to think. <br><br>I'm having trouble following your logic. I disagree with the Jun wagon based on one statement, so that makes me scummy?

Randomly voting at any point other than the beginning being scummy...well, that greatly depends. If it's truly \"random\", then I would say it's certainly not town motivated.<br><br>The page number makes no difference with regards to MM's attack. It was a very good attack, actually. Reality is that we were already discussing serious leads. We had moved on from RVS by the end of page 1, as it should be, to be honest. Jun came in at the end of page 2 and ignored everything serious, didn't bother commenting on it, and then voted someone randomly. Further, when called out on it, Jun actually OMGUS'd with a call for an application of \"lynch all liars\" policy based on the fact that MM apparently \"lied\" about being out of RVS, despite the fact that we were provably out of it.<br><br>This is not town.

It's a specious argument, in my opinion. Scum don't want RVS, scum want bad wagons. Even assuming that RVS was \"over\" when Jun first voted, random votes out of RVS are very likely to be town in my experience. It's basically a gambit by scum to do something like that because they draw way too much attention to themselves. Accordingly, scum is more likely to be among those seeking to lynch out-of-RVS random voters, because people who draw attention to themselves become easier to target. Scum tend to go for easy targets. <br><br>As to my vote -- I'm currently voting for a player that posted a bad argument. That doesn't mean that I don't think that you and Rob are kind of scummy.

Non-vanilla roles are more scarce than vanilla roles.<br>2. People like to be non-vanilla roles.<br>3. Because of 1 and 2, people tend to value non-vanilla roles more highly than vanilla roles.<br>4. 3 is even more so in the case of scum roles because scum is the other \"team\" in the game, and you only get to play the other team every once in a while.<br>5. In a mass replacement scenario, people are more likely to hold onto roles they value more highly.<br>6. Therefore, in a mass replacement scenario, town roles are more likely to replace out than scum roles.<br><br>Feel free to quibble with me on this, but I feel like my logic is at least not nonsense, and so I will vote accordingly. 2/5 chance of hitting scum is better than 2/9.<br><br>This doesn't invalidate your vote for me in any way. If you agree with my speculation, then lynching me is a positive information play, and you should do it -- so long as you honestly think that none of Jun, MM, YOLO, or Drummer are more likely scum than I am. An opinion I would disagree with, by the way:<br><br>Jun - my gut read was initially very strong town. Her reaction under pressure did not look like something a scum would do. On the other hand, she doesn't hunt, and has basically been laying low since my wagon started to build. This is still not enough to push me off my initial read; I am stubborn like that.<br><br>MM - she looks like she's hunting, but I don't think she really is. She posts content and asks a lot of good questions, which seems town. On the other hand, she hasn't voted yet in this game, which to me indicates a lack of commitment or conviction. She pushes a crappy argument regarding the RVS stage that leads to votes on the Jun wagon, but never herself votes for it. She then softy repudiates her argument and declares herself \"uneasy\" with the Jun wagon as attention shifts to me. She honestly looks to me like scum who's just content to sit back and let the town eat itself alive with a minimal amount of prodding here and there. If I wind up today's lynch, I <span style=\"font-style: italic\">implore</span> you to take a serious look at lynching her on day three once you lynch YOLO. <br><br>YOLO - is literally voting for me because my read didn't agree at all with the popular opinion at the time (Jun wagon). What kind of reason is that? Not a reason at all. I can understand thinking a person who doesn't see things the way you do is scummy -- I do it. But I can't understand voting for someone simply because they differ from the groupthink. From my perspective, it seems to me like he thinks this argument will make it easier for him to pull people off of Jun's wagon onto mine. Scummy.<br><br>Drummer - is the only one of the other four original cast members I would say has done actual scumhunting this game. He states an actual reason for suspecting me, unlike YOLO. YOLO thinks I'm scummy because I vehemently disagreed with a wagon, Drummer thinks I'm scummy because I made a play he would have made as scum.

I tend to find it easier as scum to drift along with the common consensus, because disagreeing with people who you know to be town is putting yourself in the spotlight.

I just don't see town saying this. <br><br>I like to lynch you today because of the reasons stated above, plus a scum flip would pretty much clear YOLO and MM. On the other hand, a town flip on you would allow me to see MM and YOLO in different light. <br><br>But it's far too early to lynch imo, we have plenty of time and several new people yet to post any serious content.

I think TCS was not the easy wagon when it started.

TCS made legitimate slips that shifted the \"easy wagon on Jun\" to a hard but legitimate wagon on TCS."}

I don't think TCS has posted anything substantive that legit changes my read on him between nachomama's posts. I can see this being explained by:<br><br>1. Scum nacho bussing scum TCS, seeing the wagon is dissipating and so he tries to jump off (not very likely because if scum is bussing scum, wouldn't they rather keep the distance between them instead of jump off in a really noticeable way)<br>2. Scum nacho pushing for town TCS mislynch, sees mislynch potential for TCS later on and decides to jump off his wagon. (Pretty likely imo. I have seen this happen before in a couple games).<br>3. Town nacho voting for scum TCS lynch, jumps off for a. reactions, b. discussion<br>4. Town nacho voting ing for town TCS lynch, jumps off after reading TCS town due to pro scumhunts that I didn't personally pick up on/find legit/valid.<br><br>I think that the last three scenarios seem like they could be possible.

It's possible scum will try to bus one another, but I'm not entertaining that idea on d1. Maybe later when there's more flip info. For now, I find it unlikely TCS and MM are both scum. That doesn't mean I'm going to stick to this position all game.<br><br>@thor... ok so you're persisting with the vulnerable comment. This is dumb, really dumb. I had one vote on me, you were holding yours, and the person I'm seriously considering voting for comes along and says he thinks maybe if I'm scum I hammer already. Had he instead voted for me, and you stick to your guns, that's L-2. Now if we disagree here, fine, but I consider L-2 to be vulnerable.

As far as I recall, I said I didn't care which one died. I guess now I prefer to lynch MM first, because I can honestly say that my scum read on MM is not OMGUS. My scum read on nacho might be, I basically see him attacking a townie based on the work that you have done thor. It could be opportunism. But maybe he's town and thinks I'm scum. When I read his ISO without scumgoggles on, I can accept he can be town. He does seem to be scumhunting, as do you.<br><br>The strength of my scum reads might well be questionable. More questionable than my town read on TCS, imo."}

Easy mislynch.\" If they're town, they'll pressure you because they think you're scummy (and rightfully so).<br><br>The reason I didn't respond to your post originally is because I thought it was a joke from RVS, not something meant to be taken even remotely serious (which is also why I went after Dan...I couldn't believe someone had gotten defensive and worried as a result of a joke post on page 1).</div></blockquote> <br><br>and I'm not scared of pressure. if the above statement was true though, I would have received a lot more pressure for what I did. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=4742915#p4742915\" class=\"postlink\">post 47</a>, The Central Scrutinizer wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=4742513#p4742513\" class=\"postlink\">post 42</a>, Jun wrote:</cite>I have nothing to hide!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</div></blockquote><br><br>As stupid as I feel saying this, scum doesn't post this.

It just draws attention to her votes which makes it seem less like something a townie would do.<br><br>Town Ms Marangal I guess has this just as a playstyle quirk?<br><br>--<br><br>Admittedly I'm not 100% comfortable slotting Ms Marangal as town after reading her iso, but I'm comfortable enough with Ms Marangal for now that I would much rather lynch someone like TCS who has been dropping scumtell after scumtell.

Awesome that this game revived.<br><br>First, a belated note to HD in regard to the following post:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=4761542#p4761542\" class=\"postlink\">post 135</a>, Human Destroyer wrote:</cite>Drummer: I pointed out something right above this post. Calling YOLO scummy for calling something out as scummy that you yourself found scummy? That's so bad. Also strawmanning of YOLO. Jun vote is terrible too.</div></blockquote><br>Actually, no. YOLO thought it was suspicious that TCS had a gut read on Jun because he said TCS struck him as an analytical person. I thought TCS\u2019s gut read on Jun was suspicious because it would be a smart scum move. Different reasoning. However, I do see where you\u2019d be coming from if you were reading it in a hurry. And most of the rest of Post 135 I like a lot. Your reasoning strikes me as a legitimate attempt to tease out town from scum. I\u2019d say HD leans town. A bit weak to copy YOLO\u2019s supposed \u201cstrawman\u201d argument, but I\u2019ll let it slide because of the good town read on you.<br><br>Onward. After reading TheRev\u2019s first several posts, I expected him to be lynched or close to it by the time I caught up. He replaced Rob and provided a <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4760277#p4760277\" class=\"postlink\">lengthy analysis</a> of various posts to that point, though he provided little content besides \u201cYeah Jun is town\u201d, \u201ctown\u201d, \u201cMore scumminess from TCS\u201d, \u201cThis looks town\u201d, etc. There were a few token pieces of reasoning in there, but not many. I wouldn\u2019t say that one should necessarily provide immediate reasoning for every read\u2014depending on the player\u2019s style\u2014but I don\u2019t see the pro-town purpose of a post that long with so little in the way of analysis. Seems more like an attempt to feign active contribution, especially when considered along with statements like \u201clet\u2019s get this game moving\u201d. In later pages, actual analysis does appear to pick up as other players engage him.<br><br>At the bottom of <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4761206#p4761206\" class=\"postlink\">Post 125</a>, TheRev notes that he disliked the fact that Thor put Jun at L-1. That\u2019s all fine and well, but I took particular note of this comment: \u201cI don\u2019t see why he\u2019s in any hurry.\u201d Thor\u2019s stated intention was to stir things up, not to rush a lynch. I don\u2019t believe TheRev actually misunderstood Thor\u2019s intentions any more than I did, which makes me consider the above quoted insinuation all the more telling. Scum like to plant seeds. Obviously, if Rev does turn out to be scum, his interactions with Thor make the latter unlikely to be the scum partner.<br><br>In <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4762690#p4762690\" class=\"postlink\">Post 149</a>, we see TheRev back down after Thor trips him up with his own words, and then in subsequent posts, TheRev stops responding to that line of discussion completely. Always interesting to me when a player stops a given exchange by simply not responding to it anymore. Later, Rev responds very defensively over Nacho\u2019s vote on him. After that, a bizarre adjustment to his read of TCS after TCS says Rev would have hammered him if he were scum (I disagree).<br><br>Alright, it's late, so I'm stopping before total incoherence sets in. Wanted to get in a post before crashing. Saw plenty of reasons to vote Rev over the last few pages, some of which are listed above.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Unvote; Vote: TheReverend</span>"}

First of all, due to me being town and in the dark about everyone else, my reads are subject to change. Thus, when I post a T/S list, how can the scum know this is how I'll feel one day later? Further, if everyone posts T/S lists, then when scum flips, their reads and logic can be analysed.<br><br>Your refusal to commit to wagons with a vote is scummy. There is no town motive for not voting. Sure we want to keep scum on their toes, but our most powerful scumhunting tool in endgame other than PR confirmed stuff is to analyse wagons, and if you're not part of them, you avoid wagon scrutiny. That's why it's scummy to note vote for someone you hardcore think is scum. You're the most persistent person on my case, yet you're holding back your vote still based on this town read of rob that you said nothing about while he was alive.<br><br>MM is scum, town.

Not to mention some players in this game like to hover over the thread for hours and the replacements are far more talkative than the replaced. Not complaining of course. Carry on.

The latter because they\u2019re good at playing consistently the same way every game, whether town or scum, meaning the better strategy is to analyze their voting patterns down the road as opposed to trying to read their alignments now.

It\u2019s certainly better reasoning than you gave for voting TCS at any rate. I\u2019ll have a better idea of you if you continue to contribute. As you will of me, no doubt.<br><br>HD &amp; MM are my town reads. I think HD is legitimately trying to scumhunt (Post 135 had the strongest town vibes). We all know mafia can fake scumhunt, but either way scum hunters are not my top priority D1. MM is very aggressive and I don\u2019t agree 100% with her reasoning against Rev (e.g., town/scum lists help scum?), but I tend to think her opening post in this game would be a somewhat unlikely gambit for scum. The incessant back-and-forth with Rev hasn\u2019t been very informative from my perspective\u2014the drawn-out arguments rarely are\u2014but her extreme aggressiveness seems town to me.<br><br>TCS, I don\u2019t know. Sometimes he posts things that are more commentary than analysis, but I don\u2019t know his style. He seems pretty laid back about things in general. I don't have enough information about him yet to make a call either way. Going to ISO.<br><br>TheRev started out scummy, then went to a fairly town defense, and then settled into a bitter \u201cscrew you all\u201d anti-town mood, where he tries to stir up confusion because\u2014according to him\u2014it amuses him and it\u2019s fun. His later posts strike me as less scummy than his earlier posts, but the play-style changes themselves make me suspicious. I think he\u2019s a solid wagon for D1.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=4774145#p4774145\" class=\"postlink\">post 406</a>, TheReverend wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=4773872#p4773872\" class=\"postlink\">post 396</a>, Thor665 wrote:</cite>so why is this particular habit the gold standard?</div></blockquote><br><br>Thor, why do you suppose MM had a scum read on you, when she simultaneously has a hardcore scum read on me?<br><br>pedit - YOLO is town too.

Nacho's replacement hasn't change my mind at all about his role. He gave a lot of curt responses and the slapfight between him and TheReverend made me laugh (page 5). All he did was sit around and accuse TheReverend of being scum with little to no base, then trying to jump on Thor's accusations of it without giving his own reasonings, or even trying to give his own reasonings. I don't like that he just latches on to certain people and just points an accusatory finger and am a little confused why people think it's so town. It seems more wishy washy and vague so that he can later come up with new meanings to what he truly meant at the time.<br><br>Rob13 and TheReverend I actually feel pretty town about at this point. His arguments for TCS, while I don't agree with, seemed solid, especially about TCS's continual support for Jun despite everyone turning on him/Jun turning on him.

Something to compensate? In particular, his immediate town tell on Jun after Jun's reaction to 2 votes. He seems to go out on a limb for Jun a lot despite pretty weak support from Jun herself. However, it's also pretty dumb to put yourself out like that for someone and gain all that attention. #124 gave me weird vibes - someone who disagrees with me isn't naturally scummy, especially if they give good reasoning. <br><br>Jun I have a hard time reading. Getting defensive early, but also bringing a lot of good points #85 and questioning TCS rather than jumping at the chance of an aid, despite people putting pressure on her. <br><br>Shisou/Thor - hard to tell. Haven't gotten a lot from them at this point (on page 5). (Page 6) Sparking discussions, questioning Nacho's big jumps to weird conclusions (why does no one else seem to?) <br><br>Messiah/HD - not a lot from him yet at this point.

She pops in and out a lot less frequently than the others, though, however that also probably has to do with replacements.<br><br>Dannflor's reaction to MM (I know, it's just in the first couple pages, but yeesh seriously, what an overreaction) was pretty over the top and freaking out to try to point fingers at MM. Nacho's replacement hasn't change my mind at all about his role. He gave a lot of curt responses and the slapfight between him and TheReverend made me laugh (page 5). All he did was sit around and accuse TheReverend of being scum with little to no base, then trying to jump on Thor's accusations of it without giving his own reasonings, or even trying to give his own reasonings. I don't like that he just latches on to certain people and just points an accusatory finger and am a little confused why people think it's so town. It seems more wishy washy and vague so that he can later come up with new meanings to what he truly meant at the time.<br><br>Rob13 and TheReverend I actually feel pretty town about at this point. His arguments for TCS, while I don't agree with, seemed solid, especially about TCS's continual support for Jun despite everyone turning on him/Jun turning on him. His #147 post was pretty shit, but I still feel like he's doing it out of stupid town rather than scum.<br><br>TCS is over-talking a lot, analyzing every detail he's said, even when it doesn't seem quite right/pretty weak support himself. Something to compensate? In particular, his immediate town tell on Jun after Jun's reaction to 2 votes. He seems to go out on a limb for Jun a lot despite pretty weak support from Jun herself. However, it's also pretty dumb to put yourself out like that for someone and gain all that attention. #124 gave me weird vibes - someone who disagrees with me isn't naturally scummy, especially if they give good reasoning. <br><br>Jun I have a hard time reading. Getting defensive early, but also bringing a lot of good points #85 and questioning TCS rather than jumping at the chance of an aid, despite people putting pressure on her. <br><br>Shisou/Thor - hard to tell. Haven't gotten a lot from them at this point (on page 5). (Page 6) Sparking discussions, questioning Nacho's big jumps to weird conclusions (why does no one else seem to?) <br><br>Messiah/HD - not a lot from him yet at this point. I agreed with some of his points in #135, though it's pretty similar to my recap except a little bit more relevant at the time since it was at the end of the pages at that time (page 6) while I'm not even halfway through.<br><br>Hoping to catch up soon!</div></blockquote><br><br>I'm willing to chalk TCS's early town read on me up to RVS shenanigans since I've since found something more scummy to pursue (HD's gambit) that seems particularly scummy to me. Have you had a chance to read up to that part yet?"}

Like, a lot. Putting someone at L-1, yet supposedly not voting until someone else gives her the hammer (if scum, she would be successfully lynching someone she had already been pursuing yet it's a lynch with full town support of it so it makes her innocent), begging for someone who hasn't already made the vote to vote her way. However, she's doing it in such an over the top and attention grabbing way like the all caps - I just can't see why she would do that so confidently in this point in time. On Day 1. When we really don't have much to go off of. I can see this happening from scum at the end of Day 2 or any time during Day 3, but not Day 1.  She's also done this to a few people already. It basically opens her up to be attacked on this later on, and she's not shying away from it, but fully embracing it (and has been consistent about it since the first couple pages).

I don't want to be lynched for one of two reasons... I am town and want town to win, or I am scum and want scum to win. Me being lynched is (usually) contrary to my win condition, whatever my alignment. I am happy to be lynched only on those rare occasions when there's enough confirmed town to lock a win, and I am not confirmed. This is not one of those situations. Like I say, a null tell. <br> <br>I don't see town getting anything from my lynch, no answers to speak of. What happens when I flip town? I've shown too much doubt in my reads for town to blindly sheep me. And you can all talk about what happens if I flip scum, but these will be empty words tomorrow. All that will happen is people look a little more at you and nacho. And then town will sheep thor.

Why are you singling out Thor? Didn't Nacho and MM start this? Followed by Drummer and now TCS?

SK is a free agent. SK's don't need to protect a teammate/preserve a team. SK can blend easier because they can question more people and lynch scum without worry, so they can and could scum hunt legitimately because they also have no idea who mafia are and maf kills are just as good for them.<br><br>Granted, I don't know how common SK's are in games on here and I don't think she is one (and nobody has really brought it up here so I'm assuming no one believes they are common).

What are your reads...?</div></blockquote><br><br>I voted HD inititally because there were active members who could respond to an HD vote (HD himself, MM who is tied because of his dayvig, TSC) and we were under the impression that there were only 6 hours left. I didn't want to sit around still catching up when we have a ML, so I wanted to see what a vote would do. <br><br>HD was nowhere near a lynch. Two people on Reverend weren't going to change their minds because they weren't even there (Thor and Drummer). I didn't feel comfortable putting him at L-1 when possibly two people wouldn't even have the chance to see everything that happened in between and change their votes. (This was when we still weren't sure about the real deadline). I didn't think HD would actually be lynched, and yes, did it as sort of a reaction test, but even if he were, I would be able to see better connections amongst people (Jun, Rev, TCS, MM even though I already have strong feelings about her). Even if he is town. TCS had been deciding between him and MM and yet, with the bandwagon on Rev, decided to suddenly change his mind and vote on Rev. HD was around the boards at the time, so he had time to discuss it if he wanted to (and did).<br><br><br>Also, YOLO/I really have not contributed at all much at that point (probably still haven't, eh?). Because he/I have been generally lurk-y/not present all game, I didn't want a night kill to happen and have nothing for town to go off of. Or I didn't want a lynch to happen and go into Day 2 without my own areas. I generally have not interacted with many people and wanted to make a statement. If I get lynched, that's fine - town has better insight into who is doing what and how people have reacted around me. YOLO was super lurk-y and I've been pretty bad about catching up on information so haven't said much. Getting lynched for those reasons would be obvious - scum would be right to say that both YOLO and I have not contributed much to discussion and have been sort of coasting under the radar. At least this move will help somewhat in future tells.<br><br>Then Mod said we had more time (like I originally thought so I was taking longer to read through everything). So the vote just kind of seems overly dramatic. <br><br>And now that I have time to look at what I quoted from TCS, I realized I read it wrong and lack reading comprehension. He was actually defending his jump from HD. I thought he had said there were connections between HD and others that would be revealed but decided not to vote for HD (presumably under the idea that HD wouldn't be lynched anyway since there weren't enough votes or time). <br><br>But anyway, reads. This was as I was reading and all before I read the day vig stuff:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>TheReverend wrote:</cite>[quote=In\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4764891#p4764891]No, I'm saying I think nacho and MM are scum. I haven't farted any percentages out. If you want to know why I think they're scum, read my posts again. It's all there, I'm not throwing down scum reads on people without reason. I don't care which one gets lynched today. If you wanna call that 50/50, fine. It doesn't mean my reads are equal. It might be 49/51, I'll have do some some complicated maths if you want to know exactly which one I find scummier.</div></blockquote><br><br>I didn't like this. People who say \"this person or that person should be lynched! - either one is fine with me. I don't care between these two people but one has to be gone today!\" I feel like actually secretly lean one way or the other but are trying to protect one or the other.<br><br>Rev WIFOMS that other people have pointed out and I agreed with and felt weird about:<br><a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4768386#p4768386\" class=\"postlink\">#249</a><br><a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4768403#p4768403\" class=\"postlink\">#250</a><br><a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4768418#p4768418\" class=\"postlink\">#251</a><br><br>Like a lot of town, I was leaning towards Rev. But I also find it weird that there really isn't a lot of Rev-support. Are scum eating up the fact that he used so much WIFOM to protect himself? Are his partners abandoning him and we're just not noticing? Or is this a deliberate setup? Again, at the time, I didn't want to put him at a lynch when two people weren't there. If those two people still weren't here and deadline remained the same, I probably would have changed my vote and put it on Rev. But I wanted to give it time first, and get a better understanding of the relationships around me (and also, a lot of my reads have been revolving around Rev since about page 8 or 9, so I wanted to get out of tunneling). <br><br>MM I mostly feel town about as explained before, but <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4770066#p4770066\" class=\"postlink\">this post</a> made me wary since having the hammer also means having an overwhelming town support. Or it could mean that she doesn't actually want Rev lynched and is protecting him for some reason. <br><br>HD's day vig thing made me L to the OL. I thought it was a bold plan, but it came at a Rev-heavy moment. Outside of that, I couldn't tell either way about him. While he's not my actual preferred lynch today, I do think his lynch would clear up some things about other players. Which is why, if 3 other people magically piled on his vote within my vote and the earlier deadline, I would not be completely devastated. Barring power role status, but let's not get anyone to actually claim anything right now.<br><br>TCS feels a bit sketchy to me, and I wanted to see his reaction to my HD vote before throwing in an actual, solid vote. It didn't happen because mod came in and called the actual deadline. If the earlier deadline were in place, I think I would have voted for Rev, but TCS is someone I'm keeping an eye on.<br><br>Jun pops in and out frequently. She's had some good points since her initial freak out - such as <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=25700&amp;p=4745442#p4745442\" class=\"postlink\">this</a> and <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=25700&amp;p=4751630#p4751630\" class=\"postlink\">this</a> - that I think makes a lot of sense. And I don't think someone put in this position would bite the person supporting her at that point in time.<br><br>Drummer - again, most of my view on him is based off of Rev, which I know I shouldn't tunnel like that. But I thought his fight with Rev about English was stupid. He did, however, try to bring the context back to the game while Rev let it wander.<br><br>Nacho - I felt weird about your pointing fingers at random people but you've calmed down a lot and I also agree with your posts. Such as <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4764843#p4764843\" class=\"postlink\">this on Jun</a>.

Sounds like you\u2019re just sheeping Then-Rob here. Why is <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4741496#p4741496\" class=\"postlink\">Dannflor\u2019s reaction</a> being seen as such a big deal? Personally, I felt that it was obvious MM was screwing around, but it seems like Dannflor took her seriously. Looking at what he said, though, I don\u2019t know where the huge overreaction is that you and Then-Rob were raising your eyebrows at. I don\u2019t mind sheeping so much, but I find it suspicious that you're sheeping an unfounded read.<br><br>I\u2019m not sure I believe your points against Rev, either. It\u2019s mainly just arguments that others have put forth. And then, for example, when you <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4789538#p4789538\" class=\"postlink\">referenced</a> that bit where Rev and I went completely off topic screwing with each other, you made it seem like I was more on topic than Rev was during that whole thing, which isn't really true. I don't see why you would bring that up at all (<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4790378#p4790378\" class=\"postlink\">twice</a>) except to tack another point against Rev. I get the impression that you\u2019re just sheeping existing arguments against him and fabricating a few points to supplement it. I can point out more examples of this if needed. Thor thinks that a YOLOdoodle lynch isn\u2019t really on the table right now with so little interest in it, but if anyone gets interested, I'm down. Almost all of what he has said strikes me as sheeping and recapping points others have made. Didn't get town vibes from his predecessor either.<br><br>Rethought the MM thing a lot. Mainly read her as town because of the extreme aggressiveness, but she still won\u2019t respond to HD\u2019s 458. I\u2019m not sure what the explanation for that is. Maybe that she doesn\u2019t think she can argue against what he said? Also, MM\u2019s <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4771514#p4771514\" class=\"postlink\">Post 333</a> catches my eye because she speaks as if there\u2019s only one scum out there (\u201cIf it isn\u2019t either of you, it\u2019s probably Thor\u201d). Suggests that she may be the other scum (no reason not to presume we have 2 of them). And if she\u2019s scum setting up lynches, 3 mislynches are all she needs to win, which is what makes me suspect Rev, TCS, and Thor are town if MM is scum. I\u2019d be less certain about Thor in that scenario, however, since he\u2019s only mentioned as a 3rd option, which could simply be distancing. ON THE OTHER HAND\u2026\u2026<br><br>TCS\u2019s <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4789398#p4789398\" class=\"postlink\">Post 510</a> is very town. When MM saw it, she unvoted him, which was also a town move. More points to her for that. Actually, a lot of points to her for that. Looks to be honest reading. So I'm ambivalent about her now.<br><br><a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4790594#p4790594\" class=\"postlink\">Post 531</a> by Rev is good. Reading back over the whole thread, looking for slips and scum tells. That\u2019s what town does. I\u2019m not sure how strong the argument would be that what he found are scum slips, but I see where he\u2019s coming from. Granted, scum can fake scum hunt, but I find it unlikely that someone would notice that unless they were legitimately looking. And I agree that it\u2019s worth consideration down the road if TCS or Jun flips scum.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Unvote: Rev</span><br><br>Not very confident about lynching Rev or MM at this point, and the latter's wagon is gone anyway.

To me, an \"irrelevant spat\" and \"trying to nitpick something that didn't matter\" mean the same thing, so I don't know what else to say to that. In regard to me stating there was no interest in a kashoodles lynch, what I actually said was that <span style=\"font-style: italic\">Thor</span> thought your lynch was not an option today (for lack of desire, support, and time). And I understand why he said that, too. Looking at the votes and what we thought the deadline was, it seemed unlikely that you were a feasible lynch today. HD &amp; MM commented on it, but I still don't know that there's much interest per se, because they weren't interested enough to put a vote behind it. But anyway, I'm not sure how it matters. We agree that lynching you was not an original idea.<br><br>As for the Dann stuff, I don't find your argument very compelling. He wasn't sure if MM was joking and he started playing seriously, questioning people about their posts. So? My second post of the game was serious.

Rev was suspicious of Nacho's sharp changes in reads/votes. He has voiced this repeatedly throughout the game. The first time he brought it up, I noted that it's seemingly in line with Nacho's usual playstyle. And you likewise noted in post 395 that Nacho is playing with his usual meta. Maybe you\u2019ve changed your mind, and if so, examples please?<br><br>The other point was from you in Post 535. You said Nacho was slurping along and not contributing protown activity, while everyone else was. I don\u2019t see any particular instances that you referenced. This looks like a normal D1 for Nacho to me. But I've only read a few games he was in and I've only played one game with him.<br><br>As you mention here, it takes effort to find actual points made against Nacho.

I know I keep bringing it up, but I'm subbing in after 20 pages worth of stuff happened.

Not really pessimistic so much as TCS and HD had not yet voted on me yet had expressed great interest in it before. Plus, while being lynched isn't the best situation, I feel better at least making a splash than to continue lurking because at least, if lynched, there's more information about those who interacted with me. <br><br>I'm feeling better about Rev, but I don't know if it's just because he's coming to my defense and reverse OMGUS-ing (and don't know if that's because the wagon is off him).<br><br>MM I still feel confidently town about, as does Drummer.<br>Jun I'm feeling less town about - I wish she would post a bit more frequently.<br>TCS/Rev I still feel more scum about.<br>HD - felt scum blips and then he turned into a second wagon? I feel decent about his lynch, like with mine, I feel can get a lot more informations about relationships of people interacting in this game.<br>Thor/Nacho I still don't get much from. <br><br>It won't let me add more quotes right not for some reason:<br><br>@TCS - Oops, I've been playing a lot of Epic Mafia lately and forgot it's 5 to lynch, not just majority."}

Maybe if kash/TCS are scum together then kash is predisposed to see TCS as scummy so that's why he posts that TCS is overtalking/compensating. (I found TCS scummy early game but for different reasons).<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=4783841#p4783841\" class=\"postlink\">post 480</a>, kashoodles wrote:</cite>Hey there!<br><br>I've been skimming through (on about page 7) trying to catch up, and will do a better read through in a bit (as well as finishing reading!).<br><br>Initial feelings:<br><br>MM I feel is pretty ballsy for scum. If anything, I think she would be a SK, but I get town vibes from her. She pops in and out a lot less frequently than the others, though, however that also probably has to do with replacements.<br><br>Dannflor's reaction to MM (I know, it's just in the first couple pages, but yeesh seriously, what an overreaction) was pretty over the top and freaking out to try to point fingers at MM. Nacho's replacement hasn't change my mind at all about his role. He gave a lot of curt responses and the slapfight between him and TheReverend made me laugh (page 5). All he did was sit around and accuse TheReverend of being scum with little to no base, then trying to jump on Thor's accusations of it without giving his own reasonings, or even trying to give his own reasonings. I don't like that he just latches on to certain people and just points an accusatory finger and am a little confused why people think it's so town. It seems more wishy washy and vague so that he can later come up with new meanings to what he truly meant at the time.<br><br>Rob13 and TheReverend I actually feel pretty town about at this point. His arguments for TCS, while I don't agree with, seemed solid, especially about TCS's continual support for Jun despite everyone turning on him/Jun turning on him. His #147 post was pretty shit, but I still feel like he's doing it out of stupid town rather than scum.<br><br>TCS is over-talking a lot, analyzing every detail he's said, even when it doesn't seem quite right/pretty weak support himself. Something to compensate? In particular, his immediate town tell on Jun after Jun's reaction to 2 votes. He seems to go out on a limb for Jun a lot despite pretty weak support from Jun herself. However, it's also pretty dumb to put yourself out like that for someone and gain all that attention. #124 gave me weird vibes - someone who disagrees with me isn't naturally scummy, especially if they give good reasoning. <br><br>Jun I have a hard time reading. Getting defensive early, but also bringing a lot of good points #85 and questioning TCS rather than jumping at the chance of an aid, despite people putting pressure on her. <br><br>Shisou/Thor - hard to tell. Haven't gotten a lot from them at this point (on page 5). (Page 6) Sparking discussions, questioning Nacho's big jumps to weird conclusions (why does no one else seem to?) <br><br>Messiah/HD - not a lot from him yet at this point. I agreed with some of his points in #135, though it's pretty similar to my recap except a little bit more relevant at the time since it was at the end of the pages at that time (page 6) while I'm not even halfway through.<br><br>Hoping to catch up soon!</div></blockquote><br><br><br>TCS realizes that Kashoodles's argument against him is kind of strange. Overtalking... I actually like kashoodle's elaboration on TCS in this post which I think was part of my town read on kashoodles. In any case, I think this is a valid point, but it could also just be explained by TCS's playstyle. I don't know enough about him to tell for certain.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=4784585#p4784585\" class=\"postlink\">post 482</a>, kashoodles wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=4784333#p4784333\" class=\"postlink\">post 481</a>, The Central Scrutinizer wrote:</cite>Seriously, who calls someone out for \"over-talking\"?<br><br>Anyway, welcome.

I'm vain like that. c;<br><br>Over talking as in you are doing something and then explaining it so in detail, when the detail is unnecessary. It seems like you're trying to seem like you talk a lot when you're actually treading lightly by adding a bunch of fluff. <br><br>#57, for example. You say that if Jun is scum, then you'd be happy to accept defeat to it, yet you use it to justify your vote. It's almost like you're putting these details out there so that later on, whether you're right or wrong, you can always claim that you once said this. Or you could always go back on it later on, if you're mafia, saying \"Oh my. I was mistaken. You were a really clever scum along, like I said.\" Or \"Oh my. I was right. You are super town and I knew it all along.\" You overexplain what you mean almost as to wipe your hands clean of what you said.<br><br>But a lot of pages have happened since then, and I'm not caught up. Just my initial reads. I don't agree with a lot of what YOLO said about you, to be honest. He seemed to be trying to latch onto someone just to latch onto someone and hoping that what he said would be helpful.</div></blockquote><br><br>So here's a post where I think that kash/thor is less likely (again just based on kash's iso) because the few posts nacho pulled up about thor do look bad.<br><br>Would kash forget to mention his scum buddy in a post of reads on players? I really don't think so. It seems more likely that kash would light bus a partner like he does to TCS than forget him, but maybe that's just my opinion...<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=4790403#p4790403\" class=\"postlink\">post 530</a>, kashoodles wrote:</cite>I fail at quotes formatting. <br><br>Forgot Thor:<br><br>While skimming, I didn't really pay attention to him.

Of those YOLOdoodles posts listed, only the last one by kashoodles gives a definitive town read of MM. All of the others call her probably town, but simultaneously anti-town, possibly a SK, stinking of scum, or protecting Rev (this point by kash made absolutely no sense, but may have been attempt to say MM &amp; Rev were possibly a team?). To me, it is closer to a null read than a straight town read because \u201ctown\u201d is always tempered with \u201cscum\u201d in the same paragraph. It looks like they\u2019re being careful to mention that MM could well be scum (just in case)."}

Also, since I outlined reasons I suspected you that have nothing to do with you voting me, you can always look at those and decide how they affect my stance. Also, I did explain why your vote on me looked bad and added to the strength of my case - so it's not like I was hiding an awareness of your vote on me, but maybe you should address why my read of your vote is wrong and how the vote doesn't look opportunistic?<br><br>Also, as noted, your whine about you voting me is sketchy because over half of the remaining players are voting me, to try to paint me with OMGUS when my primary attacks are one person voting me and one person hard defending me, clearly falls short. By definition, I am more than 50% likely by total random chance to be suspecting someone who is currently voting me - yes, I am likely to suspect someone who is voting me. Shock."}

It was being proposed by Rev that she and he run off essentially. Yet she had recently voiced the opinion that maybe Rev wasn\u2019t such a great choice of lynch after all (on Page 18). So even though she could have easily put Rev close to lynch, I think she feared it would seem inconsistent of her to readily switch back to Rev just like that. She also may have thought it possible that she would be the one lynched instead of Rev in that scenario, so by voting a third party, she dissipated the idea that they would have a run off at all. Of course, both interpretations (mine and Thor's) are plausible, but that very fact causes the incident not to move me in either direction.<br><br>YOU, on the other hand, TCS, proposed that you and Rev run off, and encouraged him to vote for you to get it going. You stated that this was due to the fact that you consider any lynch better than a no lynch because we get information. To me, that kind of tell is much more compelling. That's one of the main reasons I read you as town. MM makes statements to the effect that she doesn't care if she's lynched, but you actually step up to the chopping block and say \"Let's do this.\" Those are two completely different things."}

Maybe that she doesn\u2019t think she can argue against what he said? Also, MM\u2019s Post 333 catches my eye because she speaks as if there\u2019s only one scum out there (\u201cIf it isn\u2019t either of you, it\u2019s probably Thor\u201d). Suggests that she may be the other scum (no reason not to presume we have 2 of them).

If anything, I think she would be a SK, but I get town vibes from her. She pops in and out a lot less frequently than the others, though, however that also probably has to do with replacements.<br><br>Dannflor's reaction to MM (I know, it's just in the first couple pages, but yeesh seriously, what an overreaction) was pretty over the top and freaking out to try to point fingers at MM. Nacho's replacement hasn't change my mind at all about his role. He gave a lot of curt responses and the slapfight between him and TheReverend made me laugh (page 5). All he did was sit around and accuse TheReverend of being scum with little to no base, then trying to jump on Thor's accusations of it without giving his own reasonings, or even trying to give his own reasonings. I don't like that he just latches on to certain people and just points an accusatory finger and am a little confused why people think it's so town. It seems more wishy washy and vague so that he can later come up with new meanings to what he truly meant at the time.<br><br>Rob13 and TheReverend I actually feel pretty town about at this point. His arguments for TCS, while I don't agree with, seemed solid, especially about TCS's continual support for Jun despite everyone turning on him/Jun turning on him. His #147 post was pretty shit, but I still feel like he's doing it out of stupid town rather than scum.<br><br>TCS is over-talking a lot, analyzing every detail he's said, even when it doesn't seem quite right/pretty weak support himself. Something to compensate? In particular, his immediate town tell on Jun after Jun's reaction to 2 votes. He seems to go out on a limb for Jun a lot despite pretty weak support from Jun herself. However, it's also pretty dumb to put yourself out like that for someone and gain all that attention. #124 gave me weird vibes - someone who disagrees with me isn't naturally scummy, especially if they give good reasoning. <br><br>Jun I have a hard time reading. Getting defensive early, but also bringing a lot of good points #85 and questioning TCS rather than jumping at the chance of an aid, despite people putting pressure on her. <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Shisou/Thor - hard to tell. Haven't gotten a lot from them at this point (on page 5).

I agreed with some of his points in #135, though it's pretty similar to my recap except a little bit more relevant at the time since it was at the end of the pages at that time (page 6) while I'm not even halfway through.<br><br>Hoping to catch up soon!</div></blockquote>"}

Nacho's replacement hasn't change my mind at all about his role. He gave a lot of curt responses and the slapfight between him and TheReverend made me laugh (page 5). All he did was sit around and accuse TheReverend of being scum with little to no base, then trying to jump on Thor's accusations of it without giving his own reasonings, or even trying to give his own reasonings. I don't like that he just latches on to certain people and just points an accusatory finger and am a little confused why people think it's so town.

However, it's also pretty dumb to put yourself out like that for someone and gain all that attention. #124 gave me weird vibes - someone who disagrees with me isn't naturally scummy, especially if they give good reasoning. <br><br>Jun I have a hard time reading. Getting defensive early, but also bringing a lot of good points #85 and questioning TCS rather than jumping at the chance of an aid, despite people putting pressure on her. <br><br>Shisou/Thor - hard to tell.

The lack of that from others is disconcerting - and makes me suspect the push as not as good as one might hope. It's the same energy you saw/see with the push on me 'blargh, soooo scummy!

If he was embarrassed by it why did he keep pressuring me about the exact point showing it? He was unaware how potent my point even was, and was bulldogging over it thinking he 'had' me on something. He didn't care about whether he was right or not - even if he was so worried about looking bad he should at least, as town, have cared if he was right in any way at all. But he didn't. That suggests the scumhunting is totally faked.<br><br>2. You are too sensitive about whether or not people agree with your points. I personally think there are theoretically about the same number of 'points' aised on both MM and I - it doesn't make either case inherently better or worse. I've seen great cases with one point and bad ones with twenty. The issue is whether or not people have blinders on.<br><br>3. Could you remind me again about TCS - I am still totally not getting a decent vibe from him. HD should also probably be a stronger read for you unless you think he faked the self-hammer attempt (which, I'll admit *I* kinda do, but no one else has claimed to, methinks) Still, as counter to a scum lynch, he is a terrible lynch option today - we can consider him better tomorrow if needed.<br><br>4. I don't find it characteristic of either town or scum Nacho. I've seen him semi-flake with no clear connection to being town or scum. My issue with him is how he's communicating - I think town Nacho would feel comfortable admitting to not being 'up to date' on stuff. This Nacho is blatantly unaware of the game state...and is MAKING MAJOR CLAIMS ABOUT HIS READS AT THE SAME TIME. So...basically he's not reading and has no frame of reference for...anything, yet he wants us to believe he has strong reads, and also isn't admitting that he has no actual connection to the game at all. that's fake as hell."}

Enlighten me, oh God of Thunder.<br><br>On that note, reading MM's posts makes me think that she literally believes that Thor is a god. Also, this:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=4790811#p4790811\" class=\"postlink\">post 534</a>, Drummer wrote:</cite>Rethought the MM thing a lot. Mainly read her as town because of the extreme aggressiveness, but she still won\u2019t respond to HD\u2019s 458. I\u2019m not sure what the explanation for that is. Maybe that she doesn\u2019t think she can argue against what he said? Also, MM\u2019s Post 333 catches my eye because she speaks as if there\u2019s only one scum out there (\u201cIf it isn\u2019t either of you, it\u2019s probably Thor\u201d). Suggests that she may be the other scum (no reason not to presume we have 2 of them). And if she\u2019s scum setting up lynches, 3 mislynches are all she needs to win, which is what makes me suspect Rev, TCS, and Thor are town if MM is scum. I\u2019d be less certain about Thor in that scenario, however, since he\u2019s only mentioned as a 3rd option, which could simply be distancing. ON THE OTHER HAND\u2026\u2026<br><br>TCS\u2019s Post 510 is very town. When MM saw it, she unvoted him, which was also a town move. More points to her for that.

Seeing as how I could get you lynched over i due to how sloppy it looks, I tend to suggest it is not 'awesome'. Also, seeing as how you thought to investigate Nacho (as in - you didn't think he was obv. town) and then you called me out for suspecting him of being scummy and suggested that made me scummy, even though you literally had just been suspecting him that night yourself...yeah, your logic is highly questionable right now. So don't sprain your writs trying to pat yourself on your back.<br><br>3. I would wager, using your above examples, I could go and get an \"innocent\" that you didn't intend.

I am not being scummy right now. I am questioning you and not accepting everything you say as absolute truth. That is called scumhunting, oddly, being suspect of you is *not* a scumtell. Just like telling me you think I'm town doesn't mean I have to not scumhunt you. It's a crazy world like that.<br><br>8. I could have used a yoga meditation class analogy, if that would make you feel better. You tossed out some AtE - I was stating that I didn't care about your AtE. I didn't call you dumb for it, you decided in your own head I did. What I did, clearly, say was that I didn't care what your emotional reaction was since I was trying to scumhunt. You'll probably call that scummy in a few but...meh, such is life in this game where apparently town don't read the game and it's scummy to be scumhunting and asking questions. <br><br>9. You also didn't defend that really bad meta call you made, so I'll just presume you dropped it. Good."}

From where I stand, it\u2019s pretty straightforward: Jun and HD are the two I\u2019m good with lynching. Either of them really. As mentioned before, TCS\u2019s express willingness to be lynched D1 strikes me as town (whether you agree that lynching for the sake of lynching is good or not). His posts yesterday generally indicated that he was reading MM as town based off of that one point Thor made about her D1. Scum don\u2019t need to base their reads off things like that.<br><br>At the end of D1, I noted that MM, Rev, &amp; TCS were all showing strong town tells (granted, I was fencing on MM). I put that aside D2 and led a mislynch on MM. Which is all the more reason for me not to brush off my town tells on TCS. Like I said, HD &amp; Jun are both good candidates. The point about why would scum-Jun attack someone reading her as town is a good point, though not conclusive. For me, it\u2019s more a question of which order do you guys want to lynch them in?"}

When someone has polarised reads to mine, I certainly don't default to \"OMG you're scum\", I consider that maybe my reads are wrong. Consider thor. He thinks jun and YOLO are scum... I think both are town. Thor thinks TCS is town, I think scum. Now, sure I might have thor \"slightly leaning scum\" as a result of contrasting reads, but I do not consider it a strong read at all.  It's possible I just got a bad feel for the game as I read through. Or it's equally as possible thor did. A disagreement in opinion does not equal different alignment. So this post from TCS reinforces my scum read on him, and in turn my town read on YOLO.<br><br>Also, we have a new mod and new players. I'm active, as you can see, and I believe thor is a mafiascum vet. Let's get this game moving.</div></blockquote><br><br>I agree with this post because just because someone has polarized reads to you doesn't mean that you OMGUS them. I've been guilty of this in the past, but I've learned that it probably means that they're just reading the thread differently than you with a different perspective. Again makes me question TCS's YOLO vote.

I tend to find it easier as scum to drift along with the common consensus, because disagreeing with people who you know to be town is putting yourself in the spotlight. So when I'm scum, I'm more likely to agree with townies on who is \"scummy\", especially if a townie can take the fall for a town flip. <br><br>My suspicion of you begins when you vote messiah, just as dan is getting heat and mentions inactives.

On the other hand, a town flip on you would allow me to see MM and YOLO in different light. <br><br>But it's far too early to lynch imo, we have plenty of time and several new people yet to post any serious content.

Honestly, it's probably better for me that you chose this route. I didn't really want to have to decide if you or Jun was full of shit if you came back with a guilty on her.<br><br>I'm super tired and wasting time in the middle of an all-nighter writing a final paper, so this may be less than coherent. And I may not be around too too much the next few days because of paper, graduation, etc. To Jun and particularly Thor, please remember this and give me some kind of time to defend/answer questions. <br><br>I pretty much expected that some version of this was going to happen after the Drummer death. If Jun were the last scum I would have expected her to kill you and push the lynch on me. I really had no idea after the HD flip, but it makes way more sense if it's you. Once you get the MM lynch and successfully kill Nacho, you claim cop yesterday to \"clear\" Thor, the player who was doubting you/your slot the most, and buy yourself a day and possibly the game. You have a convenient innocent on a dead player. And of course you have a guilty to seal the deal on the last day. You have Jun who's thought I was scum from Day 1, and Thor who has expressed a willingness to vote me several times now. Easy game from your perspective.<br><br>what exactly was my endgame here as scum? When I hammered HD yesterday without comment I would have to know I would get investigated (news flash: I hammered him because I figured scum was in Jun/HD and it didn't matter; I expressed that opinion yesterday on more than one occasion. Sorry, town.) And assuming I'm scum, I know that Jun is going to vote me; he/she has been riding that horse forever now. I'm supposed to fight all that inertia and get her to flip and vote for you? Thor? Basically I'm backing myself into an auto-lose situation. When I could kill the cop instead and be in a game with Drummer (who stated repeatedly that he thought i was town), Thor (who is against me but could possibly flip against Jun), and Jun, who will obv vote me? Bleh. That's like saying I get my choice of guns to play Russian Roulette with, and I picked the gun with six bullets in the cylinder instead of the gun with three.<br><br>Basically it makes zero sense for me to be scum in this position. But like I said... thanks for making it easy on me by picking me instead of Jun.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Bacde</span>"}

Randomly voting at any point other than the beginning being scummy...well, that greatly depends. If it's truly \"random\", then I would say it's certainly not town motivated.<br><br>The page number makes no difference with regards to MM's attack. It was a very good attack, actually. Reality is that we were already discussing serious leads. We had moved on from RVS by the end of page 1, as it should be, to be honest. Jun came in at the end of page 2 and ignored everything serious, didn't bother commenting on it, and then voted someone randomly. Further, when called out on it, Jun actually OMGUS'd with a call for an application of \"lynch all liars\" policy based on the fact that MM apparently \"lied\" about being out of RVS, despite the fact that we were provably out of it.<br><br>This is not town.

Honestly, it's probably better for me that you chose this route. I didn't really want to have to decide if you or Jun was full of shit if you came back with a guilty on her.<br><br>I'm super tired and wasting time in the middle of an all-nighter writing a final paper, so this may be less than coherent. And I may not be around too too much the next few days because of paper, graduation, etc. To Jun and particularly Thor, please remember this and give me some kind of time to defend/answer questions. <br><br>I pretty much expected that some version of this was going to happen after the Drummer death. If Jun were the last scum I would have expected her to kill you and push the lynch on me. I really had no idea after the HD flip, but it makes way more sense if it's you. Once you get the MM lynch and successfully kill Nacho, you claim cop yesterday to \"clear\" Thor, the player who was doubting you/your slot the most, and buy yourself a day and possibly the game. You have a convenient innocent on a dead player. And of course you have a guilty to seal the deal on the last day. You have Jun who's thought I was scum from Day 1, and Thor who has expressed a willingness to vote me several times now. Easy game from your perspective.<br><br>what exactly was my endgame here as scum? When I hammered HD yesterday without comment I would have to know I would get investigated (news flash: I hammered him because I figured scum was in Jun/HD and it didn't matter; I expressed that opinion yesterday on more than one occasion. Sorry, town.) And assuming I'm scum, I know that Jun is going to vote me; he/she has been riding that horse forever now. I'm supposed to fight all that inertia and get her to flip and vote for you? Thor? Basically I'm backing myself into an auto-lose situation. When I could kill the cop instead and be in a game with Drummer (who stated repeatedly that he thought i was town), Thor (who is against me but could possibly flip against Jun), and Jun, who will obv vote me? Bleh. That's like saying I get my choice of guns to play Russian Roulette with, and I picked the gun with six bullets in the cylinder instead of the gun with three.<br><br>Basically it makes zero sense for me to be scum in this position. But like I said... thanks for making it easy on me by picking me instead of Jun.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Bacde</span></div></blockquote><br>I like how you are acting like it makes NO SENSE to leave the cop alive when thor has already expressed reservations about my slot<br><br>you have a good chance here and you know it, and you are playing the \"woe is me\" card like a champ<br><br>Let's just ASSUME that you are scum (we both know that this is true, but for the sake of hypothetical situations lets just leave it as an assumption), and that we lynched HD yesterday.  Who is the optimal kill for you?  Well, there are only 3 possible viable kills tbh: Bacde (cop), Thor (cop inno), and Drummer (doc inno).<br><br>You could kill Bacde.  That would have left you with Thor (cop confirmed), Jun (thor LOVES this slot), and Drummer (doc clear).  Does not look good.<br><br>You could kill Thor.  That would have left you with Jun (suspicious of you), Drummer (doc clear), and Bacde (cop who will find you guilty).  Still not looking good.<br><br>But what about killing Drummer?  That would have left you with Thor (suspicious of Bacde), Jun (the wildcard, is suspicious of you), and Bacde (will get a guilty on you).  This option doesn't look great, but its the best of the 3.<br><br>It makes perfect sense that Drummer died and you know it.  And you have the best chances of winning right now out of any of the kills you could have made.</div></blockquote><br><br>Yeah, I think Drummer is the best kill for TCS scum. But Drummer is also a good kill for Bacde scum since it frames TCS. If Bacde is scum, he can't kill himself so he needs a plausible reason why he didn't die. I believe Drummer, Thor, everyone thought it was between HD/JUN/TCS.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=4959086#p4959086\" class=\"postlink\">post 1538</a>, Bacde wrote:</cite>I guess we had a 1 doc + townies situation and I correctly called that there was no cop on d3 and riskily claimed it despite my predecessors claiming a different role.

That would seem to me the default scum line, especially when he's leading wagon, possibly L-1 though I haven't checked. Any counterwagon would do for scum. TCS did not take this line. Thus, I think he's town. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=4767042#p4767042\" class=\"postlink\">post 245</a>, Nachomamma8 wrote:</cite>Every action has two sides.

Honestly, it's probably better for me that you chose this route. I didn't really want to have to decide if you or Jun was full of shit if you came back with a guilty on her.<br><br>I'm super tired and wasting time in the middle of an all-nighter writing a final paper, so this may be less than coherent. And I may not be around too too much the next few days because of paper, graduation, etc. To Jun and particularly Thor, please remember this and give me some kind of time to defend/answer questions. <br><br>I pretty much expected that some version of this was going to happen after the Drummer death. If Jun were the last scum I would have expected her to kill you and push the lynch on me. I really had no idea after the HD flip, but it makes way more sense if it's you. Once you get the MM lynch and successfully kill Nacho, you claim cop yesterday to \"clear\" Thor, the player who was doubting you/your slot the most, and buy yourself a day and possibly the game. You have a convenient innocent on a dead player. And of course you have a guilty to seal the deal on the last day. You have Jun who's thought I was scum from Day 1, and Thor who has expressed a willingness to vote me several times now. Easy game from your perspective.<br><br>what exactly was my endgame here as scum? When I hammered HD yesterday without comment I would have to know I would get investigated (news flash: I hammered him because I figured scum was in Jun/HD and it didn't matter; I expressed that opinion yesterday on more than one occasion. Sorry, town.) And assuming I'm scum, I know that Jun is going to vote me; he/she has been riding that horse forever now. I'm supposed to fight all that inertia and get her to flip and vote for you? Thor? Basically I'm backing myself into an auto-lose situation. When I could kill the cop instead and be in a game with Drummer (who stated repeatedly that he thought i was town), Thor (who is against me but could possibly flip against Jun), and Jun, who will obv vote me? Bleh. That's like saying I get my choice of guns to play Russian Roulette with, and I picked the gun with six bullets in the cylinder instead of the gun with three.<br><br>Basically it makes zero sense for me to be scum in this position. But like I said... thanks for making it easy on me by picking me instead of Jun.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Bacde</span></div></blockquote><br>I like how you are acting like it makes NO SENSE to leave the cop alive when thor has already expressed reservations about my slot<br><br>you have a good chance here and you know it, and you are playing the \"woe is me\" card like a champ<br><br>Let's just ASSUME that you are scum (we both know that this is true, but for the sake of hypothetical situations lets just leave it as an assumption), and that we lynched HD yesterday.  Who is the optimal kill for you?  Well, there are only 3 possible viable kills tbh: Bacde (cop), Thor (cop inno), and Drummer (doc inno).<br><br>You could kill Bacde.  That would have left you with Thor (cop confirmed), Jun (thor LOVES this slot), and Drummer (doc clear).  Does not look good.<br><br>You could kill Thor.  That would have left you with Jun (suspicious of you), Drummer (doc clear), and Bacde (cop who will find you guilty).  Still not looking good.<br><br>But what about killing Drummer?  That would have left you with Thor (suspicious of Bacde), Jun (the wildcard, is suspicious of you), and Bacde (will get a guilty on you).  This option doesn't look great, but its the best of the 3.<br><br>It makes perfect sense that Drummer died and you know it.  And you have the best chances of winning right now out of any of the kills you could have made.</div></blockquote><br><br>Yeah, I think Drummer is the best kill for TCS scum. But Drummer is also a good kill for Bacde scum since it frames TCS. If Bacde is scum, he can't kill himself so he needs a plausible reason why he didn't die. I believe Drummer, Thor, everyone thought it was between HD/JUN/TCS.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=4959086#p4959086\" class=\"postlink\">post 1538</a>, Bacde wrote:</cite>I guess we had a 1 doc + townies situation and I correctly called that there was no cop on d3 and riskily claimed it despite my predecessors claiming a different role.

TCS tries to soft bus a scum buddy, then hops off for some BS reason. Later, a train starts on kashoodles for no apparent reason and so TCS stays off the wagon hoping that HD is lynched instead. The way the wagon went, it was going to be close so it makes sense for scum buddy TCS to not bus his partner because it could have been the difference between kashoodles living.<br><br>Bacde's slot hammered kashoodles, when HD could have been lynched instead. There's something to be said about a bussing argument. I'm alway suspect of the 1st vote b/c it could be scum light bussing, the 2-3rd votes could be scum wagoning early to avoid suspicion (usually following PR results tho), later votes could be scum realizing the wagon is taking off and want to get on the wagon to avoid suspicion, hammer vote could be scum who wants the towncred of hammering the scum buddy. tl;dr, voting on scum is suspicious to me, also not voting on scum is suspicious to me. But I think that in this case, TCS voting on YOLO but not on kashoodles is way more scummy to me than potential scum Bacde hammering scum buddy kashoodles for town cred.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=4923614#p4923614\" class=\"postlink\">post 1404</a>, The Central Scrutinizer wrote:</cite>Let me get this straight.<br><br>Your theory is that I sheeped Drummer so that I could blame Drummer for MM's mislynch even though I knew early on in the day that my nightkill was going to clear him the next day?<br><br>Then I was the first one to point out that I thought Drummer was clear based on that nightkill?<br><br>I don't really have a counterargument for your point about not being on kash's wagon.

Jun, who has been adamant in his/her desire to lynch TCS. Thor, who has indicated a desire to vote TCS and in all likelihood will badger TCS until TCS insults Thor into voting TCS. Bacde, the beneficiary of everything sitting pretty in an endgame scenario with virtually no risk of loss. My argument is in my mind stronger than any gold-plated \"scum tells\" you can hope to sift out of the pile of shit that is this game -- <span class=\"noboldsig\">IT DOESN'T MAKE LOGICAL SENSE FOR ME TO BE SCUM IN THIS END GAME SCENARIO WHEN AS SCUM I WOULD HAVE HAD SOME MEASURE OF CONTROL OVER IT.

We're at the point where it's just the OH I WOULDNT DO THIS IF I WAS SCUM WOULD I? Although, I notice again that TCS tries to appear to the \"absurdity\" of him putting himself in the situation. Seems more like TCS is going through a layer of absurdity to try to make us second guess ourselves.<br><br>Basically, there is no comparison between TCS Scum and Bacde Scum.
