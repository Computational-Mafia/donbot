Venice... Venezia! A floating paradise in northern Italy. Even more beautiful in winter, with this romantic storm! There can be no criminals here: the ideal place for a short vacation.\"<br>\nWell, this is what Deputy Director White, Interpol Anti-Mafia officer, thought, as he entered the hall of the nice little Hotel on the Isle of Burano.<br>\n<br>\n4 hours later, <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">the body of the Deputy Director White, Harmless Town Dummy, is found dead in his room, with a rock down his throat</div>. A typical mafia-style murder.<br>\n<br>\nDespite the best efforts of the hotel staff - which consists of the director only - it turns out that it is impossible to contact the police. The island is isolated because of the rainstorm, that is actually getting worse and worse.<br>\n<br>\nThe 13 guests of the Hotel were not very happy about the weather in the first place, but now they start to look really nervous. They happen to be the secret witnesses of a process against an important mafia boss, and guess what? Mr. White was supposed to protect them! Except now he is dead, and it is evident that some of the supposed \"witnesses\" are in fact mafia killers in disguise.<br>\n<br>\nThe director of the hotel seems embarassed: \"ladies and gentlemen... I am afraid... we won't be able to leave this place for several days... I guess... you should find some way to protect yourself before the police arrives... and now that I mention \"protection\"... well it occurs me that...\"<br>\n<br>\n*click*<br>\n*slam*<br>\n*click*<br>\n<br>\nthe director disappears in the cellar. I guess you guys need to think about someway to defend yourselves. <br>\n</div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">THE RULESET</div><br>\n<br>\n1) This game is daystart.<br>\n2) I am the moderator, and my decision in a dispute or other game related manners is final. Of course, I am still human, so please point out any errors and I will attend to them.<br>\n3) Votes should be made in bold, like <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">vote: lewarcher82</div>. You must <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">unvote</div> before you vote again, otherwise your vote will not be altered.<br>\n<span style=\"padding-left:0.5in\"></span>3a) Votes will be counted as long as I can recognize the name of the player you mean to vote. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">vote: lew</div> will be accepted, but <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">vote: that son of a bitch that voted me</div> won't.<br>\n4) Lynches will occur when one player has received the majority of votes. You may post between the \"hammering\" vote and the \"death scene\" but no votes may be changed during this time.<br>\n<span style=\"padding-left:0.5in\"></span>4a) After I announce that a player was lynched, and before I close the thread for night, it will be twilight. Game can be discussed during twilight, but I can interrupt you at any time to make the night start.<br>\n5) Nights will last 48 hours. If you have a night action, you must submit it to me via pm. If I do not receive your PM within 48 hours, I will simply assume you are not using your power during the night.<br>\n6) Do not quote any private communication from me. You may paraphrase, but you may by no means copy-paste my words.<br>\n7) You MAY NOT discuss the game outside of the thread unless your role specifically gives you the ability to do so.<br>\n8) Days will last 2 weeks.<br>\n<span style=\"padding-left:0.5in\"></span>8a) I will automatically give extensions in case someone replaces out. If it takes me x days to find a replacement, the dead line will be extended of x days.<br>\n9) <div style=\"display:inline;color:#000080\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Dark Blue</div></div> is my color. Don't use it.<br>\n10) I am sympathetic about V/LA, so please do inform me before you leave for an extended period (72 hours). Otherwise, I will prod you. If you haven't responded to me within 48 hours, I will replace you.<br>\n11) In the event a deadline is reached without a lynch, it will become a no lynch by default.<br>\n12) Once you die, you're dead. You are allowed one \"bah!\" post, but no more than one, and it must contain no game related content.<br>\n13) No invisible text, codes, editing or deleting posts!<br>\n14) Insults and verbal aggression will result in sudden modkill. Since the definition of insult is very vague, I will be the one who decides what is tolerable and what is not.<br>\n15) I reserve the right to change the rules if it is absolutely necessary.<br>\n16) Remember, this is a game! Have fun.<br>\n<br>\n<fieldset style=\"border:3px outset grey;padding:5px 10px\"><legend style=\"text-transform:uppercase;margin:0 0.6em;padding:0em 0.33em\">VANILLA TOWNIE PM:</legend>You are a <div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF00\">Vanilla Townie</div>, and have nothing but your word and your vote.

It was obviously not a case of omgus and it created a bit of ruckus that shouldn't have existed. I usually say counter-voting the one who just voted you is OMGUS, although there is more behind it. In any case, that accusation wasn't totally serious.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Erratus wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Exilon wrote:</cite>So you're saying my random-voting stage vote needs to be NOT random?</div></blockquote>\nNo. wtf, where did you get the idea that I said that? Other people cast blatantly random votes and I didn't attack them.</div></blockquote>\n\nI got that idea from the fact you called on me because I supposedly had a reason to vote Ythan instead of you, and I didn't. When you say that, you're ignoring the fact it is RVS and, as bolded:<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>erratus wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Exilon wrote:</cite><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">So you're saying I called Ythan scum based on this QUESTION, BEFORE he even posted:<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>So Ythan, you're scum this time, yes?</div></blockquote></div></div></blockquote>\nUh... duh? \"So Ythan, you're scum this time\" is blatantly calling someone scum. The \"yes?\" on the end doesn't change that, because you're not asking Ythan if he is scum, you are calling him scum and then asking him for confirmation.</div></blockquote>\n\nThis is what people mean when they say you're arguing about semantics. Look how tenaciously you are interpreting the \"yes\" portion of the sentence, even though you've been told the intention behind the sentence several times, which would eliminate the need to do that.<br>\n<br>\nFirstly, as long as the question isn't rethorical (And even if it was, it couldn't be considered anything else than a joke), there is implied doubt, no matter how it is structured. Second, if I'm asking confirmation on the fact he's scum, then, as said, it means there is DOUBT, effectively making it a question. <br>\n<br>\nThat aside, the POINT is you're taking something seriously that you shouldn't. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">You voted me because you believed I was calling ythan scum, yet voted you. Yet you totally failed to reason there was no possible way for me to call him scum (because there was nothing at the time), which destroys that reasoning. </div> (And in that case, we're (I'm) left with only one other option that remotely justifies your counter-vote: OMGUS.  Do you see now where it comes from? You might say you didn't justify your vote like that, but scum usually mask their reasons, so it's not totally unreasonable to think that way.)<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Erratus wrote:</cite>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Exilon wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Erratus wrote:</cite>Bullshit!

Don't impose yourself like that. \"it is normal for townies to have two fso's out\" IS, no matter how you put it, an opinion. Why? Look at your adjective: \"normal\". There is no OBJECTIVE way to define the word normal. Even further, saying something is \"normal\" comes from your perspective and your perspective only. In your experience, that might happen a lot, but for example, in my case, I rarely see FOS's.<br>\n<br>\nI might be repeating Plague a bit here, but I feel this is important. <br>\nTwo fos's might even be normal, but maybe two fos's in the same post in the beginning game might not be as so. This can be anyone's opinion, and you yelling TELLING them \"YOU'RE WRONG, IT IS NOT OPINION, IT IS FACT\" is not going to change that.

Don't impose yourself like that. \"it is normal for townies to have two fso's out\" IS, no matter how you put it, an opinion. Why? Look at your adjective: \"normal\".

In your experience, that might happen a lot, but for example, in my case, I rarely see FOS's.</div></blockquote>\nYeah, if you have some weird-ass definition of \"normal\" maybe.

That's how I interpreted your post. </div></blockquote>\n\nIf that's how you interpreted my post, which is basically how it was supposed to be interpreted, then there's no rational way your accusation back then works. You pretty much said I was contradicting myself because I had called Ythan scum yet voted you, but from this post, you know that I wasn't certain. This doesn't make much sense.</div></blockquote>\nOf course I knew you weren't certain, it was page one for cryin' out loud. I don't see how that doesn't make sense though. The whole reason I found it weird was 'cause it was like you were sayin' \"I accuse Ythan of being scum. Vote: Erratus\".

E.g. 60% of your games have people who FoS early and therefore it becomes \"normal\" for you; in my games 5% do and therefore my idea of normality is different from yours. It's pretty much subjective. </div></blockquote>\nI was gonna argue this but it made me realize something that renders my whole point invalid. As I said to ICE's questions, my last finished game was over two years ago. The meta has probably shifted since then.

I pointed out that I did indeed have a reason, tacked on the rolling eyes smiley, and left a \"you have no defense\" remark to prod Exilon into explaining his point. (I didn't actually think he wouldn't have a defense, by the way. I just felt like Exilon's response wasn't taking me seriously enough, and that that sort of comment might make him do otherwise.)

{"number": 325, "id": "2874721", "user": "ICEninja", "user_id": "12670", "content": "The reason I think a massclaim right now would be good is because their role blocker is dead. This means a lot. Since the dead player is a role blocker, we can probably assume that there is only a single mafia family. There was also no distinction between one dead player and another. If we have a doctor, which is very likely considering the no townie kill, then we probably have a confirmed town (and 2 if you count the doctor). If we have a vig, that stands as another confirmed town and someone scum will be forced to night kill. If we have a cop with a guilty result, that should be claimed ASAP as it could lead to a perfect game (assuming 3 scum). Even a cop with an innocent result clears himself and a townie, and probably won't be NKed right away because of a doc.<br>\n<br>\nOther roles that could have prevented the night kill such as jail keeper can also claim. This gives us indefinite information (as the person could have been the NKer or the NKie), but it gives us somewhere to start. EVEN MORE additionally, the death of a mafia roleblocker indicates that there is probably no more scum power roles. Scum is going to claim power role at dire peril to themselves, as a lone scum needs to focus on self preservation at an absolute 100% maximum here.<br>\n<br>\nI think there is a decent chance that, considering the number of lynches we have, town could have a guaranteed victory here. For example, vig, doc who saved someone, and cop with an innocent clears 5 people by claiming, which means scum won't really stand a chance of night killing all of them before lylo.<br>\n<br>\nThat being said, I'm perfectly happy holding off too.

I don't see SKs running around minis too often, so I'm going to run with the assumption that it was a vig. Likewise, we have some kind of kill prevention (unless scum simply messed up, which I've seen happen before in a couple games). That would indicate a doctor, role blocker, or jail keeper as suitable roles for normal games. Role blocker is unlikely because scum had one. Therefore it is (fairly) safe to assume that there is either a doctor or jail keeper.<br>\n<br>\nIf Klazam is indeed a miller, than it is safe to say we have a cop. Even if there isn't, a doctor/vig/cop is pretty standard. If we have a jail keeper instead of doc, it is possible that the JK counts as our informative role, and we have something less powerful than a cop.<br>\n<br>\nIf Rat's death was caused by an SK and we don't have a vig, then there's no telling what kind of crazy town PRs will be flying around a mass claim tomorrow.<br>\n<br>\nI know it seems like I'm dwelling a lot on the PRs, but I win or lose games by how well they perform. I don't always have as much faith in them as I do myself as a PR, so that's why I wanted the claim.

Don't let me forget I said this, NE. I'm feeling pretty good about a lot of people so far. ICE, AGar, EA, NE, Ythan, Mae, and Exilon all seem like they're on the up and up.<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"> plague (Space Pope) is still the best wagon around right now.</div> I wouldn't criticize the moz wagon either. Mae is right to pressure Klazam a bit. These three players (and possibly Fatso) could all use attention right now.</div></blockquote>\nLook at bolded. This is the last post RC makes about SP before he jumps off SP&#8217;s wagon, onto the mozamis wagon, at sixth with a weak reasoning (&#8220;he's not going to be helpful to us regardless of his alignment.&#8221;) I noticed that he totally dropped the SpacePope wagon, and forgot about it.

(The reason why I say this applies even if Moz was RC&#8217;s scumbuddy, because there was always the chance a lynch could not happen.

This isn't too important in AGar's case, obviously, but I've said it once or twice, ICE, that I've consistentally seen you as town. This was long before you claimed. Of course a Godfather would have an incentive to befriend a Cop, but I just want to note that your claim didn't all of a sudden get me to say, \"Oh, yeah, and ICE is definitely town!\" AGar, on the other hand, never commented on what alignment he thought ICE was until D4 when he voted Ythan (implying that he saw no reason to not trust ICE's claim). <br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>RC 186 wrote:</cite>ICE, AGar, EA, NE, Ythan, Mae, and Exilon all seem like they're on the up and up. plague (Space Pope) is still the best wagon around right now.

I was seeing him as slight town for essentially the entire D1, but I recognized the case on him. That's important to note because I asked for more spotlight on this role slot whereas AGar tried to keep the discussion centered on EA and then moz. <br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>RC 286 wrote:</cite>I may be convinced on rat, but I'm having a hard time isolating anything substantial against him and not just lurker-oriented.<br>\n<br>\nLet's face it, those rat and SV are basically lurker lynches.

His basic justification for his actions was 'It's not OMGUS as long as I slap a reason on there, whether I believe the reason or not.' My vote, as I clearly said multiple times, was because anyone can slap a reason on a vote and call it \"not OMGUS\" - his reasonings looked crap and like OMGUS anyways.

You slid an (admittedly) easy Klazam lynch by, justifying it based more on the N1 flips and his miller claim than any behavior. Again, you cast your vote while trying to resign yourself from responsibility of any lynch that would happen.

You said it yourself that they weren't giving reads. <br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>AGar 482 wrote:</cite>On D1, when voting for Mozamis, you made sure to highlight that it wasn't a definite vote for scum, but rather distressed town OR panicked scum. Basically you didn't buy into the wagon, but you knew opposing it would look terrible?</div></blockquote>\n\nOh, no. I was back and forth on moz until he started getting super emotional and angsty. At that point I knew either he was making some desparate manipulation attempts or he was a poor, unhelpful townie. I was very clear about my townreads at that point in the game, and I had fair townreads on everyone except for rat, moz, SP, and SV. That's on record. I wasn't prepared to vote SV or rat at that point given that I felt they were lurking too much. That's on record. My vote, at that point, was only going to be on one of those two people. I made this clear <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2859904#p2859904\" class=\"postlink\">multiple</a> <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2868500#p2868500\" class=\"postlink\">times</a>.<br>\n<br>\nOf course it wasn't a definite vote for scum. I honestly was half prepared for moz to flip town. That's just what happens on D1 extremely often. The town has no flips to work off of, no night actions or investigations, and a fresh scum team perfectly capable of creating plenty of misdirection. Scum lynches on D1 are just one of those really rare things that you'd be naive to expect. That's why my policy is that you aim for scum, certainly, but if you take out a clear anti-town element, then, hey, at least it's not a total loss. <br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>AGar 482 wrote:</cite>You've semi-lurked and made it hard for anything to be gleaned from your posting since D1. You proposed the Klazam lynch, which was fine, but everything you've said so far is something that was already brought up at some point, and the first time you've actively attempted to make any real contributions to this game is now.</div></blockquote>\n\nUnfortunately my Spring Break week fell during the middle of D3. I was out of town and not checking the thread as often as normal. There was nothing really for me to say during D4. That was essentially a policy lynch. Had ICE have beaten me to the thread I'd have voted based on his results. <br>\n<br>\nHeck, you're hardly even in a position to make this argument. We effectively have the same number of posts. Especially considering that you have two confirmation posts and an RVS vote. So if you literally want to count posts it would be 25 vs 21 actual posts. <br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>AGar 482 wrote:</cite>You slid an (admittedly) easy Klazam lynch by, justifying it based more on the N1 flips and his miller claim than any behavior.</div></blockquote>\n\nThat was a solid, worthwhile lynch that needed to happen. Anyone who screws up a claim, one, two, is a supposed Miller in a game that has a Godfather and a Cop, and three, is still living with two scum down, should eat a lynch. I took full responsibility for that lynch and I don't think you have any evidence that says otherwise.  <br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>AGar 482 wrote:</cite>you've tried to fly completely under the radar, trying not to do anything that would attract the vig-bullet to yourself.</div></blockquote>\n\nI had a townread on Exilon long before he claimed Vig, just like I did on ICE. I was neither trying to entice an investigation nor skirt a shot. You can say neither of these things about yourself that I can tell.

It was just really weird.

His comment to Exilon, some of his points, then saying how a lot of what I pointed out was null just felt off to me and I never really could figure out why.<br>\n<br>\n2) The reasons Red gave for lynching have never once really been \"I think this person is scum\". This is his vote for moz:\n<blockquote><div><cite>Red wrote:</cite>\nEither a distressed town or a panicky scum. Either way, if this is his idea of moving forward in this game, then he's not going to be helpful to us <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">regardless of his alignment</div>.\n</div></blockquote>\nThis is a weak vote, and could very easily be busing after he knew his partner was gone. A Godfather busing a goon is all but standard. Notice too that the role blocker was the hammer.<br>\n<br>\nHere is his vote on Klazam:\n<blockquote><div><cite>Red wrote:</cite>\nEven if he is just a Miller, it's a good political tactic to just use a lynch on him now.\n</div></blockquote>\nI can't really find anything in his ISO that suggests he had any semblance of a case on Klazam at all. Scum was desperate for some mislynches at this point, and I could see this being used to draw investigation as well.<br>\n<br>\nThe closest he ever comes to actually having a scum read on someone he votes is Space Pope, who had already been hammered at the point.\n<blockquote><div><cite>Red wrote:</cite>\nIt would kind of fit, actually if he was a Godfather role. He tried to get his VT claim out there in a rush to entice the supposed Cop, knowing both that the Cop would not want to investigate a PR and that his role slot was one of the more controversial. In other words, it's like he was trying every subtle thing he could to get that investigation. \n</div></blockquote>\nMaybe I'm reading too deep, but this feels a bit like projecting to me.<br>\n<br>\n3) After I cleared him as town, Red became practically a non-presence in the game, until lylo where it was clear there is a Godfather. He coasted by completely. Sure spring break might have interfered with part of this, but probably not to the extent that Red coasted. It is exactly what scum would want to do in a situation where Godfather is cleared, anyway.

It would have gone exactly the same way as it did for Ythan, maemuki, or Space Pope.<br>\n<br>\nThen with the 50/50 I had left, I chose the wrong lynch.

He wasn't even a compulsive vig, which means that town had 3 very strong power roles, so scum, I suppose, needed something to balance.<br>\n<br>\nThat being said, AGar managed to avoid suspicion from virtually everyone for virtually the entire game. I read his ISO, and simply couldn't find much to lynch him with, and there was plenty against Red. So you played well, and deserve a (lucky) win.<br>\n<br>\nI agree with Red's sentiments for the mod, the game ran very smoothly.

Yeah, I got lucky with a few things - the massclaim broke in my favor and Exilon shooting Maemuki and not myself that night are the two big ones - but to be honest, this is probably one of the few scum games I considered a lost cause at D2 (LOST: S1 is the only other one that comes to mind... and that was lulz). I was staring down a 9:1 situation at best, with at least one doc out there, a likely cop and a killer who obviously knew what he was doing.

Red would have likely died the next night had you not proposed the massclaim. He's a player I know to be capable of excellent scumhunting and I was honestly worried about him coming around to my D1 bus. The town made the mistake as a collective of not forcing discussion on Days 4 and 5 when it was crucial to get information. I capitalized on that by remaining relatively silent and not having to commit myself to any reads, allowing my flexibility going into LYLO. Had I had to put down reads, it would've been tough to make a stretch towards RC-scum to actually put a vote down in LYLO. NE was almost predictably going to protect you to his grave, especially with you casting potential doubt on Exi as a potential SK. <br>\n<br>\nTL;DR: Yes, there was a luck factor.
