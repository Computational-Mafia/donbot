Venice... Venezia! A floating paradise in northern Italy. Even more beautiful in winter, with this romantic storm! There can be no criminals here: the ideal place for a short vacation.\"<br>Well, this is what Deputy Director White, Interpol Anti-Mafia officer, thought, as he entered the hall of the nice little Hotel on the Isle of Burano.<br><br>4 hours later, <span class=\"noboldsig\">the body of the Deputy Director White, Harmless Town Dummy, is found dead in his room, with a rock down his throat</span>. A typical mafia-style murder.<br><br>Despite the best efforts of the hotel staff - which consists of the director only - it turns out that it is impossible to contact the police. The island is isolated because of the rainstorm, that is actually getting worse and worse.<br><br>The 13 guests of the Hotel were not very happy about the weather in the first place, but now they start to look really nervous. They happen to be the secret witnesses of a process against an important mafia boss, and guess what? Mr. White was supposed to protect them! Except now he is dead, and it is evident that some of the supposed \"witnesses\" are in fact mafia killers in disguise.<br><br>The director of the hotel seems embarassed: \"ladies and gentlemen... I am afraid... we won't be able to leave this place for several days... I guess... you should find some way to protect yourself before the police arrives... and now that I mention \"protection\"... well it occurs me that...\"<br><br>*click*<br>*slam*<br>*click*<br><br>the director disappears in the cellar. I guess you guys need to think about someway to defend yourselves. <br></span></span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">THE RULESET</span><br><br>1) This game is daystart.<br>2) I am the moderator, and my decision in a dispute or other game related manners is final. Of course, I am still human, so please point out any errors and I will attend to them.<br>3) Votes should be made in bold, like <span class=\"noboldsig\">vote: lewarcher82</span>. You must <span class=\"noboldsig\">unvote</span> before you vote again, otherwise your vote will not be altered.<br><span style=\"padding-left:0.5in\"></span>3a) Votes will be counted as long as I can recognize the name of the player you mean to vote. <span class=\"noboldsig\">vote: lew</span> will be accepted, but <span class=\"noboldsig\">vote: that son of a bitch that voted me</span> won't.<br>4) Lynches will occur when one player has received the majority of votes. You may post between the \"hammering\" vote and the \"death scene\" but no votes may be changed during this time.<br><span style=\"padding-left:0.5in\"></span>4a) After I announce that a player was lynched, and before I close the thread for night, it will be twilight. Game can be discussed during twilight, but I can interrupt you at any time to make the night start.<br>5) Nights will last 48 hours. If you have a night action, you must submit it to me via pm. If I do not receive your PM within 48 hours, I will simply assume you are not using your power during the night.<br>6) Do not quote any private communication from me. You may paraphrase, but you may by no means copy-paste my words.<br>7) You MAY NOT discuss the game outside of the thread unless your role specifically gives you the ability to do so.<br>8) Days will last 2 weeks.<br><span style=\"padding-left:0.5in\"></span>8a) I will automatically give extensions in case someone replaces out. If it takes me x days to find a replacement, the dead line will be extended of x days.<br>9) <span style=\"color: #000080\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Dark Blue</span></span></span> is my color. Don't use it.<br>10) I am sympathetic about V/LA, so please do inform me before you leave for an extended period (72 hours). Otherwise, I will prod you. If you haven't responded to me within 48 hours, I will replace you.<br>11) In the event a deadline is reached without a lynch, it will become a no lynch by default.<br>12) Once you die, you're dead. You are allowed one \"bah!\" post, but no more than one, and it must contain no game related content.<br>13) No invisible text, codes, editing or deleting posts!<br>14) Insults and verbal aggression will result in sudden modkill. Since the definition of insult is very vague, I will be the one who decides what is tolerable and what is not.<br>15) I reserve the right to change the rules if it is absolutely necessary.<br>16) Remember, this is a game! Have fun.<br><br><fieldset style=\"border:3px outset grey; padding:5px 10px\"><legend style=\"text-transform:uppercase; margin:0px 0.6em; padding:0em 0.33em\">\"VANILLA TOWNIE PM:\"</legend>You are a <span style=\"color: #00BF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Vanilla Townie</span></span>, and have nothing but your word and your vote.

That's a tiny part of it. <br><br>The follow-up comment to my vote was motivated by the fact moz herself said she was sitting on a fence and that she didn't care. I find this position not only scummy, but also un-productive to town. My comment was said in a way that satirized that. A little bit like :\"ok, so you say you're comfortable not really doing anything and not building cases? Ok, cool, then let's see if you still keep that cool with another vote on you.\"<br><br>You're reaching for a case here, and you're misrepping me. And if you want to delve into semantics to say my logic is crap, (see bold) here's this for you:<br>1)If moz says she is fence sitting, then she is fence siting. When moz says, and quote, \"*PUTS EXTRA PADDED CUSHION ON FENCE, SITS ON IT*\", she is sitting on a fence. Therefore, in that post, SHE IS SITING ON THE FENCE.<br>2) My name is EXILON.

His over reaching for a case was like jumping a gun and the fact he couldn't even get the name right doesn't sound to me like someone who's read enough. Asides from that, there are certain things he said that didn't gut me well, such as the \"I could vote X and Y, but they'd be too easy.\" His justification for this didn't appease me at all, either.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Redcoyote wrote:</cite>Exilon is worse, but, yeah, there's no reason for those votes.

This means a lot. Since the dead player is a role blocker, we can probably assume that there is only a single mafia family. There was also no distinction between one dead player and another. If we have a doctor, which is very likely considering the no townie kill, then we probably have a confirmed town (and 2 if you count the doctor). If we have a vig, that stands as another confirmed town and someone scum will be forced to night kill. If we have a cop with a guilty result, that should be claimed ASAP as it could lead to a perfect game (assuming 3 scum). Even a cop with an innocent result clears himself and a townie, and probably won't be NKed right away because of a doc.<br><br>Other roles that could have prevented the night kill such as jail keeper can also claim. This gives us indefinite information (as the person could have been the NKer or the NKie), but it gives us somewhere to start. EVEN MORE additionally, the death of a mafia roleblocker indicates that there is probably no more scum power roles. Scum is going to claim power role at dire peril to themselves, as a lone scum needs to focus on self preservation at an absolute 100% maximum here.<br><br>I think there is a decent chance that, considering the number of lynches we have, town could have a guaranteed victory here. For example, vig, doc who saved someone, and cop with an innocent clears 5 people by claiming, which means scum won't really stand a chance of night killing all of them before lylo.<br><br>That being said, I'm perfectly happy holding off too.

I don't see SKs running around minis too often, so I'm going to run with the assumption that it was a vig. Likewise, we have some kind of kill prevention (unless scum simply messed up, which I've seen happen before in a couple games). That would indicate a doctor, role blocker, or jail keeper as suitable roles for normal games. Role blocker is unlikely because scum had one. Therefore it is (fairly) safe to assume that there is either a doctor or jail keeper.<br><br>If Klazam is indeed a miller, than it is safe to say we have a cop. Even if there isn't, a doctor/vig/cop is pretty standard. If we have a jail keeper instead of doc, it is possible that the JK counts as our informative role, and we have something less powerful than a cop.<br><br>If Rat's death was caused by an SK and we don't have a vig, then there's no telling what kind of crazy town PRs will be flying around a mass claim tomorrow.<br><br>I know it seems like I'm dwelling a lot on the PRs, but I win or lose games by how well they perform. I don't always have as much faith in them as I do myself as a PR, so that's why I wanted the claim. My single best skill in mafia is setup dissection and using logic gained from set information to win the game."}

I don't know how he could act in a way that wouldn't read as scum, but I just feel a subtle disappointment coming from him.

In other words, this is mostly some light distancing as the scumteam resigned to the fact that moz was going to take the first lynch.<br><br>That's about all I found worth bringing up, but I think it's good stuff to be said. To preemptively defend myself given that ICE was always sketchy about me and AGar will likely come after me, let me make a few points. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>RC 75 wrote:</cite>ICE, EA, and AGar have begun to lay the foundation for townreads.</div></blockquote><br><br>I'm quoting this because I want you both to recognize that both of you have always been fairly stable townreads for me. This isn't too important in AGar's case, obviously, but I've said it once or twice, ICE, that I've consistentally seen you as town. This was long before you claimed. Of course a Godfather would have an incentive to befriend a Cop, but I just want to note that your claim didn't all of a sudden get me to say, \"Oh, yeah, and ICE is definitely town!\" AGar, on the other hand, never commented on what alignment he thought ICE was until D4 when he voted Ythan (implying that he saw no reason to not trust ICE's claim). <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>RC 186 wrote:</cite>ICE, AGar, EA, NE, Ythan, Mae, and Exilon all seem like they're on the up and up. plague (Space Pope) is still the best wagon around right now. I wouldn't criticize the moz wagon either.</div></blockquote><br><br>I didn't talk about the penpen/Budja/rat slot because I was still rather neutral there. I wanted people to help me with a read on him. I was seeing him as slight town for essentially the entire D1, but I recognized the case on him. That's important to note because I asked for more spotlight on this role slot whereas AGar tried to keep the discussion centered on EA and then moz. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>RC 286 wrote:</cite>I may be convinced on rat, but I'm having a hard time isolating anything substantial against him and not just lurker-oriented.<br><br>Let's face it, those rat and SV are basically lurker lynches. Especially SV. There's absolutely nothing to read on that slot.<br><br>Can anyone give me a summary of the rat case? Nothing Budja said stuck out at me.</div></blockquote><br><br>This is just more evidence of what I just said.

His basic justification for his actions was 'It's not OMGUS as long as I slap a reason on there, whether I believe the reason or not.' My vote, as I clearly said multiple times, was because anyone can slap a reason on a vote and call it \"not OMGUS\" - his reasonings looked crap and like OMGUS anyways.

You slid an (admittedly) easy Klazam lynch by, justifying it based more on the N1 flips and his miller claim than any behavior. Again, you cast your vote while trying to resign yourself from responsibility of any lynch that would happen.

RC's case against me boils down to... actually nothing?</div></blockquote><br><br>I'd hardly call penpen's not-so-subtle \"Wow, AGar is so smart\" post nothing. This, coupled with that sorry excuse for a push on EA, which, admittedly, was okay at first, until you went overboard with it to clearly try and keep penpen/Budja/rat alive (<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2857789#p2857789\" class=\"postlink\">even ICE, at this point, saw that you were just swinging BS</a>), clearly separates our D1 motivations. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>AGar 482 wrote:</cite>You, on the other hand, didn't acknowledge them at all aside from calling them a lurker-lynch and ignored them until they flipped.</div></blockquote><br><br>Not all of us have the advantage of knowing which arguments are solid and which are BS. The argument against then Budja, for example, was solid. The argument against EA, for example, was BS. I called out the latter, but I wasn't prepared to rule on the former. I wanted more information. penpen/Budja/rat were lurking at the time. You said it yourself that they weren't giving reads. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>AGar 482 wrote:</cite>On D1, when voting for Mozamis, you made sure to highlight that it wasn't a definite vote for scum, but rather distressed town OR panicked scum. Basically you didn't buy into the wagon, but you knew opposing it would look terrible?</div></blockquote><br><br>Oh, no. I was back and forth on moz until he started getting super emotional and angsty. At that point I knew either he was making some desparate manipulation attempts or he was a poor, unhelpful townie. I was very clear about my townreads at that point in the game, and I had fair townreads on everyone except for rat, moz, SP, and SV. That's on record. I wasn't prepared to vote SV or rat at that point given that I felt they were lurking too much. That's on record. My vote, at that point, was only going to be on one of those two people. I made this clear <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2859904#p2859904\" class=\"postlink\">multiple</a> <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2868500#p2868500\" class=\"postlink\">times</a>.<br><br>Of course it wasn't a definite vote for scum. I honestly was half prepared for moz to flip town. That's just what happens on D1 extremely often. The town has no flips to work off of, no night actions or investigations, and a fresh scum team perfectly capable of creating plenty of misdirection. Scum lynches on D1 are just one of those really rare things that you'd be naive to expect. That's why my policy is that you aim for scum, certainly, but if you take out a clear anti-town element, then, hey, at least it's not a total loss. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>AGar 482 wrote:</cite>You've semi-lurked and made it hard for anything to be gleaned from your posting since D1. You proposed the Klazam lynch, which was fine, but everything you've said so far is something that was already brought up at some point, and the first time you've actively attempted to make any real contributions to this game is now.</div></blockquote><br><br>Unfortunately my Spring Break week fell during the middle of D3. I was out of town and not checking the thread as often as normal. There was nothing really for me to say during D4. That was essentially a policy lynch. Had ICE have beaten me to the thread I'd have voted based on his results. <br><br>Heck, you're hardly even in a position to make this argument. We effectively have the same number of posts. Especially considering that you have two confirmation posts and an RVS vote. So if you literally want to count posts it would be 25 vs 21 actual posts. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>AGar 482 wrote:</cite>You slid an (admittedly) easy Klazam lynch by, justifying it based more on the N1 flips and his miller claim than any behavior.</div></blockquote><br><br>That was a solid, worthwhile lynch that needed to happen. Anyone who screws up a claim, one, two, is a supposed Miller in a game that has a Godfather and a Cop, and three, is still living with two scum down, should eat a lynch. I took full responsibility for that lynch and I don't think you have any evidence that says otherwise.  <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>AGar 482 wrote:</cite>you've tried to fly completely under the radar, trying not to do anything that would attract the vig-bullet to yourself.</div></blockquote><br><br>I had a townread on Exilon long before he claimed Vig, just like I did on ICE. I was neither trying to entice an investigation nor skirt a shot. You can say neither of these things about yourself that I can tell. You're far more guilty of this than I am. <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: AGar</span>"}

It was just really weird. Posts <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2859904#p2859904\" class=\"postlink\">186</a> and <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2860554#p2860554\" class=\"postlink\">204</a> are specifically what I'm talking about. His comment to Exilon, some of his points, then saying how a lot of what I pointed out was null just felt off to me and I never really could figure out why.<br><br>2) The reasons Red gave for lynching have never once really been \"I think this person is scum\". This is his vote for moz:<br><blockquote><div><cite>Red wrote:</cite>Either a distressed town or a panicky scum. Either way, if this is his idea of moving forward in this game, then he's not going to be helpful to us <span class=\"noboldsig\">regardless of his alignment</span>.<br></div></blockquote><br>This is a weak vote, and could very easily be busing after he knew his partner was gone. A Godfather busing a goon is all but standard. Notice too that the role blocker was the hammer.<br><br>Here is his vote on Klazam:<br><blockquote><div><cite>Red wrote:</cite>Even if he is just a Miller, it's a good political tactic to just use a lynch on him now.<br></div></blockquote><br>I can't really find anything in his ISO that suggests he had any semblance of a case on Klazam at all. Scum was desperate for some mislynches at this point, and I could see this being used to draw investigation as well.<br><br>The closest he ever comes to actually having a scum read on someone he votes is Space Pope, who had already been hammered at the point.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Red wrote:</cite>It would kind of fit, actually if he was a Godfather role. He tried to get his VT claim out there in a rush to entice the supposed Cop, knowing both that the Cop would not want to investigate a PR and that his role slot was one of the more controversial. In other words, it's like he was trying every subtle thing he could to get that investigation. <br></div></blockquote><br>Maybe I'm reading too deep, but this feels a bit like projecting to me.<br><br>3) After I cleared him as town, Red became practically a non-presence in the game, until lylo where it was clear there is a Godfather. He coasted by completely. Sure spring break might have interfered with part of this, but probably not to the extent that Red coasted. It is exactly what scum would want to do in a situation where Godfather is cleared, anyway. Don't give town any reason to question the clear, and hope they'll kill a different \"cleared\" player.<br><br>I had a 4th smaller point but I forgot it."}

It just seemed like too much to mess with a cop than would be realistic.<br><br>I suppose I should have been wary when learning that Exilon was not a 1 shot vig. He wasn't even a compulsive vig, which means that town had 3 very strong power roles, so scum, I suppose, needed something to balance.<br><br>That being said, AGar managed to avoid suspicion from virtually everyone for virtually the entire game. I read his ISO, and simply couldn't find much to lynch him with, and there was plenty against Red. So you played well, and deserve a (lucky) win.<br><br>I agree with Red's sentiments for the mod, the game ran very smoothly. Thank you for modding.<br><br>Props again to Exilon for nailing the role blocker on night 1, that was vicious. Props again to Necessary Evil for saving me night 1. That was a great move.

Yeah, I got lucky with a few things - the massclaim broke in my favor and Exilon shooting Maemuki and not myself that night are the two big ones - but to be honest, this is probably one of the few scum games I considered a lost cause at D2 (LOST: S1 is the only other one that comes to mind... and that was lulz). I was staring down a 9:1 situation at best, with at least one doc out there, a likely cop and a killer who obviously knew what he was doing. You try playing that out as scum, then tell me how much luck goes into it.<br><br>You made the mistake of playing all of your cards on D3, and I took huge advantage of that. Red would have likely died the next night had you not proposed the massclaim. He's a player I know to be capable of excellent scumhunting and I was honestly worried about him coming around to my D1 bus. The town made the mistake as a collective of not forcing discussion on Days 4 and 5 when it was crucial to get information. I capitalized on that by remaining relatively silent and not having to commit myself to any reads, allowing my flexibility going into LYLO. Had I had to put down reads, it would've been tough to make a stretch towards RC-scum to actually put a vote down in LYLO. NE was almost predictably going to protect you to his grave, especially with you casting potential doubt on Exi as a potential SK. <br><br>TL;DR: Yes, there was a luck factor. But there were several moves I was able to capitalize on in order to propel town on the wrong track."}
