Be familiar with them before playing.<br>1.2) Unless your role PM says otherwise, you are not allowed to talk about the game outside of the thread.<br>1.3) Quoting any PM from the moderator will result in a modkill. Paraphrasing in some circumstances is acceptable.<br>1.4) This is a game and strong language/tones are possible. As long as it remains civil, it is acceptable. Personal grudges or harassment (sexist, homophobic, racist, etc.) is not acceptable. The first offense will result in a warning, while the second will result in a force replace.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Game Mechanics</span><br>2.1) All votes must either be bolded or put into vote tags. Votes without either of these formats will be ignored.<br>2.2) Votes within quote or spoiler tags will be ignored.<br>2.3) It is recommended to use a player's full name for votes, but it is acceptable to shorten it as long as it doesn't cause confusion. Any ambiguous votes will be ignored.<br>2.4) Unvoting is recommended for changing your vote, but not required. The exceptions are when you aren't placing another vote or if you have a double voting ability.<br>2.5) A lynch will be achieved when 50%+1 of the player list has their vote on a single person. Once that threshold is reached, the game enters twilight and no more votes will count for the day. No lynch votes require only 50% of the player list to go through.<br>2.6) You are allowed a single post in the thread once you are dead. This post must not contain any game-relevant information.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Activity and Deadlines</span><br>3.1) Do your best to stay active. This game is a commitment.<br>3.2) If you do not post in the thread for 72 hours, you are eligable for a prod PM. Players may request a prod if another player hasn't posted in 48 hours. <br>3.3) If a player has to be prodded 3 times in a day, or 4 times total across the game, they will be force replaced.<br>3.4) Players have 24 hours after recieving a prod to open the PM. After this threshold has passed, I will begin looking for a replacement.<br>3.5) If you will be gone for an extended period of time, you may post your V/LA in bold. The Prod Timer will be ignored for the duration and will be reset once it is over.<br>3.6) If you have to be gone for a significant amount of time, you will most likely be replaced. Finding your own replacement is appreciated, but not strictly required.<br>3.7) Deadlines will be three weeks for each day, but reduced down to two weeks if the game reaches day four.<br>3.8) Nights will have a 72 hour deadline. Failure to submit an action will result in you doing nothing for the night.<br>3.9) Deadlines for both day and night may be extended depending on the circumstances. While night deadlines will only be extended due to replacement issues, day deadlines are more flexible. Replacements are most likely to be the cause of a day's deadline extending, but aren't necessarily the only possible cause.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Other</span><br>4.1) Do not post in <span style=\"color: #008000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">green</span></span>. This is the moderator's color. Any other color is fair game, as long as it doesn't detract from the game's readability.<br>4.2) I will do my best to post vote counts at least once a day. Depending on the activity level, I will post vote counts either more or less often. If you request a vote count, I will provide one at the next opportunity.<br>4.3) Do not post cryptography, codes, invisible text, or small text. <br>4.4) Editing your post is grounds for a modkill. Don't do it.<br>4.5) All flavor is completely game-irrelevant.<br>4.6) Any hydras must notify me of who is in the hydra.<br>4.7) If a vote count is incorrect, let me know and I'll correct it when I have time.<br>4.8) Feel free to PM me if something in the game or ruleset is unclear.<br>4.9) Loopholes do not exist. Use common sense. If something sounds like it would be against the rules and isn't listed here, chances are you will still be punished for it.<br>4.10) I reserve the right to modify the ruleset as needed. If this happens, you will be notified in thread.<br><br>A sample Vanilla Townie PM is below:<br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Welcome to Mini Normal 1464!<br><br>You are a <span style=\"color: #00FF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Vanilla Townie</span></span>.<br><br>-You have a vote during the day and no day actions.<br>-You have no actions during the night.<br><br>You win when all anti-town roles have been eliminated from the game.<br><br>To confirm, please post <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=29484\" class=\"postlink\">Here</a>.</div></blockquote>"}

Due to the nature of the downtime, I will allow 96 hours before the first prod check. This is to allow people some breathing room in case they don't find out the site is back up right away.

As Zhero pointed out, his answers were basic yes/no's, even on questions that did not merit a yes/no response.  Admittedly, his survey answers were pretty much useless and in a vacuum might merit a vote.  However, we are not in a vacuum; there was a second player who gave equally useless answers to the survey.  Again, normally not a big deal, because you can only vote for one person.<br><br>In this case, however, that second person was myself... and you were already voting for me!

Heres how everyone stands in my eyes:<br>So here's my stance on pitoli first, because that was the other large wagon (isn't now though). She hasn't really been inconsistent in any of her posts, and thus far hasn't really given me any good reason to change my vote. Currently I think that Zhero should be voted for, because he decided that RQS is a scum tell, while it is simply me trying to get people posting and have some basis for voting instead of just randomly doing so. Currently 2birds and Zhero's only stated reason for voting me is because they dont like RQS. Also, if me and Pitoli were a scum team, like most people seem to think, and her posts in my defence were her coaching me, why would she do it here, instead of talking through mafia chat. Lets see... who haven't I mentioned. Monkeyman likes to make short ambiguous posts, unless he can find an attack that most people seem to agree on, and then he attacks them. Captain corporal hasn't really posted much, but I am not finding him very scummy yet. Toomai doesn't seem as scummy as he did before, I'm thinking town. Feelit is seeming kind of scummy. Daemon, MVM, N64 all haven't posted much, so cant get a read on them. Haschel I dont like because of reasons stated before.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: </span><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Zhero</span><br><br>That should be everything.

Let's get a scumscale in here and see where the players stand.<br><br>[<span class=\"noboldsig\">Scum</span>]--------Daemon-----Smudger--[<span class=\"noboldsig\">\u2219</span>]--Toonami-----HC--Feel-1b1s-----[<span class=\"noboldsig\">Town</span>]<br><br>What's most likely the case is that there's one scum on either side of this scale (assuming a three player scumteam). That said, given that scum flipped as RB and we only had one kill last night, I think we could have one scumteam of two PRs. Or possibly 2 scum and a traitor. <br><br>Smudger - Honestly, this isn't a really big scumread for me, but Smudger is much more sketchy to me than CC was. I've had the unfortunate experience of losing to Smudger after underestimating his abilities, so I am still a bit sore from that loss. This cat is colder than ice, by the way. Don't let him fool you. The two solid reasons I am running with so far just took place today. I really didn't have anything too negative to say about CC. On the contrary, CC was shaping up to be a solid townread of mine had I replaced into this game earlier. Smudger's inital catchup post struck the wrong chord with me. He emphasized the wrong points, ignored large swaths of information, and his conclusion of HC as the biggest scumread in this game really went the other direction from the reads I got. I'm willing to come to go with the idea that it's likely I am wrong about one of my town reads (assuming there is more than one scum left), but it's not as though his choice of HC is particularly convincing anyway. In all, it's just a poor start, I think. The other point I want to make is that he seems to really be ignoring pitoli's contributions to the game as a matter of fact. The first time he did it, I thought it was just odd. But with the latest post he just made, I'm starting to think it is purposeful. He's painting a picture with omissions that are glaring and obvious. That doesn't bode well for him as one that is genuinely trying to find scum.<br><br>Daemon - The first big thing I want to note about Daemon is that I really think scum would've tried hard to prevent the Infinity lynch. The living people not on the Infinity lynch: HC, Daemon, and Feel. A roleblocker is a pretty nice tool for the scumteam, so it's not something they want to lose, certainly not on the first day. Of the three living people that weren't on Infinity's lynch, Daemon is my biggest scumread. Other points against Daemon include his persistent need to apologize or be sorry for his posts. See posts 131 and 314 in my notes above for more on this. Daemon doesn't really like to hurt feelings or be too aggressive, in other words. I think most would agree that Daemon has been pretty under-the-radar this game, yes? Well, that's certainly been helpful for him so far, and today is the first day that I think he's actually around posting more often now that he's been feeling a bit of pressure. His start to D3 really turned me off. He first made the comment that VCA dictates that there was definitely scum on the MD lynch, but he forgets to note that he tried to jump aboard that wagon after it hammered. What makes this post particularly bad is when 2b1s calls him out for not acknowledging his (late) support of the MD wagon, Daemon immediately tries to sooth 2b1s' concern and wants it known that he considers himself as part of the MD lynch group. That whole exchange read as really artificial to me. Daemon being caught with his pants down, you know? Lastly, Daemon was in a really bad position on D1 when he had a turn to be influencial and use his vote to pressure either pitoli or MD (he didn't have to vote either, but he voluntarily put himself in this position) and he voted MD. He actually went out of his way to avoid the pitoli/Infinity lynch on D1, which is certainly not a good thing, in retrospect.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Daemon385</span><br><br>tl;dr = Daemon is scummy for his interaction with the pitoli/Infinity wagon, the post-MD lynch commentary, and his overall passivity. Smudger is scummy for awkward omissions in catching up and choosing HC as scum with poor rationale."}

With two (possibly; give or take) mafia left and the possible SK that leaves.....9 still town or other wise neutral. Now with the Infinity vote I had some hunch later on before he was lynch but he had honestly slipped passed me or I was too focused on Zhero in all honesty. I actually had infinity lower on my radar. Which now knowingly comes to an unfortunate foresight. And yes I did mean that I am on that list since I did vote him. There is no reason I shouldn't be.

Good vote or not.<br><br>And with TwoBirds, so you can't make the effort of playing the game for something you found out is a possible reason to put someone up who you think is scummy? You want someone else to basically do the work for you? Sure a second opinion is nice but why the hell would you put up such vague claims and just throw the hard work you make it sound to be away?

And to also cover Toomai's response also, I have had suspicions of Toomai HC and 2birds at different times throughout my time in the game. Unlike you though RC I don't have great experience at replacing into a game and so far have found focusing on those currently in the game as opposed to those who have been replaced gives me a more current read. Now I fully appreciate what that means with regard to my slot, I am not foolish enough to ignore the connotations this brings. I am currently voting Toomai based on my thoughts and inderstanding of Inifinity's scum feels and Toomai's list. Infinity is confirm scum his biggest scum suspect was Daemon, he named him as scum more than others and voted for him, so I base my current vote on Toomai on this simple fact. I am fully aware that it could very well be the case that Infinity's strategy could have been to set Daemon up as possibly town, knowing full well that he was in fact scum, through his vote, but IIRC Infintiy replaced in and stated he had no experience, so that would be a very good strategy for someone with limited experience. I can't check this as I am on my phone but are scum communicating all the time in their QT, or limited to Nighttime only? If they are limited to night time only then Infinity was flying blind which would strengthen the fact that the aforementioned strategy was, very good coming from an inexperienced player, or did not exist. I believe the later is the case here."}
