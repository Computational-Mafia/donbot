Jake MUST know that most people think scummy means that it isn't null. This isn't an uncommon interpretation.

My biggest problem with jake being scum is that I read his last couple of posts as really genuine and an honest apology, which makes it fairly believable that he was too focused/tunneled on slandaar to care about the other lynches.<br><br>The other player who stuck out is Yiley. Although he talks about the lynch and says he's fine with either Ald or Grey he never explains why, and at lynch he ends up on neither of them. In fact, I don't believe he has given his thoughts on anything; when he gets asked for them he responds with person x said it better, just read that! Which is scummy to me because it makes it easy to shift blame/pressure towards the person you are sheeping.<br><br>Also, I can see possible scum motivation in Peregrine taking forever to catch up, he has now said 2-3 times hes catching up, but nothing comes out of it.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Yiley</span>"}

Being scum, I would leave Slandaar/Jake pair alive to cause a distraction and possible mislynch situations for Day 2. Scum isn't very obligated to have Slandaar shot unless they worry that he is lying about being Odd instead of Even. This being said, Slandaar will either be shot tonight, or kept alive if there is someone else they think is PR, or possibly even Jake being shot for tonight. I highly doubt anyone would even consider touching Jake/Slandaar for a night kill for night 1, especially with the whole incident in the thread."}

Vote is still on slandaar- he seems to have read despite pretending not to but still has no scum reads. He also directly challenges what he says in 241.

He doesn\u2019t share scum reads as he thinks that helps scum\u2026 He really thinks that trying to find scum is good for the scum/makes an awful policy to try and not do anything/help the mafia.

His whole logic here is very bad, a mis-rep of alds defence and doesn\u2019t seem to understand that town reads aren\u2019t 100% sure. <br>  Then comes the vote change. He changes from his \u201cscumread\u201d of ald to grey because of this: <br>\u201dI was ignoring emo's tunnelly push because I was suspicious of her and tunnelling is garbage, but he's then I started to notice all the things he's doing.

I feel like most of his posts are attempts to look busy without any actual scum hunting and when I stopped pushing on him his activity seemed to slow down and dropped back under the radar<br><br>3.

If and this is a HUGE IF, slandaar is town, there is obvious buddying with slandaar.

I think a townie would have at least done that. Not to mention he seems to take slandaar's side more than mine.<br><br>6. The very first time he mentions JKLM is in post 488 when he says jklm IS scum and votes him.

He basically latches onto slandaar's original suspicion and runs with it. <br><br>7. in post 488 he says grey could be town, and the next time he mentions him he says he should be claiming. 1. if he is town why is he asking him to claim? 2. if his read changed then why hasn't he mentioned it? no that looks like scum ready for a mislynch and is role fishing. <br><br>8. 942 is his big post trying to paint jklm as scum but all I see when I look at it is an attack on an easy target.<br><br>There is my case on Hop.<br><br>maybe tomorrow I will do one for slandaar"}

In hindsight his \"hopsy you are back\" post is really strange.<br><br>3. tries to whiteknight by directing everyone to vote jklm<br><br>4. seems so sure jklm is scum based on absolutely no reasoning.<br><br>5. starts declaring people are town with no reasoning<br><br>6. instead of actually questioning people he makes a list read which we know I hate but doesn't even give good reasons as to why the people he thinks are scum are scum or scummy to him. Thinks Ald is scummy cause he questions slandaar's townie ness? I see a pattern here cause that's 2 people he puts into the scummy pile for doing that. Me and ald. There is no town motivation for that imo. Says hopsy is scummy but in an earlier post looked like he was buddying him and the remaining 3 players were lurkers. <br><br>so 5 scummy suspects, 3 lurkers, 1 idk and 1 who questioned his townieness. Really?<br><br>7. makes a point to PROVE to me he is town because he likes to do list reads. If he really was town he wouldn't care about my opinion.<br><br>8. multitude of lies/misunderstandings/misreps/intentionally twisting my words/avoiding direct questions/defelecting attention to something else when I make valid points.<br><br>9. Claims a PR and forces the other PR to confirm him, even though there is no gurantee that the either is actually town and when the other PR does confirm him, he acts like she never did it and plays dumb about it.<br><br>10. Still pushes policy lynches but calls them scum lynches. Don't get me wrong I LOVE a good polcy lynch but call it one. Being afraid to call it a policy lynch is someone who is afraid of how they are perceived. <br><br>FACT. JKLM is a policy lynch. Iamusername is a policy lynch. They both could be scum but the reasons that slandaar wants to lynch them are not reasons that gurantee alignment. Being afraid to call it what it actually is means he is more likely to be scum because scum wouldn't want the attention. <br><br><br>That is all I got, gotta run to go to dinner.<br><br>deuces</div></div></div><br><br>Below is my sort of case on Peregine<br><br><br><div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: </b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display: none;\">I will admit that the peregine read came from way to many prod dodges to be expected from a townie. Its literally 10x worse than anything jklm has done.<br><br>when he does try to post content he does a horrible job at it. <br><br>Pereguine's post 939 struck me as bad because emo seems like she is capable of holding her own and don's read on here was moving closer twords a town read, I don't see scum emo making that kill.<br><br>Then a little more than 20 minutes later realizes that his vote isn't going to look good and comes up with some reason to backtrack.<br><br>His entire series of posts regarding the gray lynch seems like a waste of time because I didn't see any conclusions he made or what if anything he learned about those players. <br><br>post 980 sort of confirms what I am thinking because he admits he was doing data collection which imo he could have easily posted on his own laptop and done the work behind the scenes, but instead he made it a point to show to everyone he was trying to contribute. This rubs me wrong, like he is trying to improve his public opinion.<br><br>so while my read on Peregine isn't as strong as the other 2, it's stronger than anyone else. <br><br>Username would fall next but again that's more for policy, he is just as bad as JKLM but because slandaar has pushed harder on jklm than he has for username, I think username would be a likely partner.</div></div></div><br><br>now it's time for you to put up or shut up.

You say I do it to earn town cred when the only opinion on them seems to be your \u201cthey are scummy\u201d-that would gain the opposite.<br>4.)\tIf someone has a \u201creaction test\u201d that involves them being scummy I\u2019m going to push them on it and not just let them say, \u201cEverything scummy I\u2019ve done was for other reasons.\u201d<br>5.)\tMy reasons for voting you were not due to slandaar, I gave my reasons for it.<br>6.)\tNobody ever votes without reasoning behind it you mean? \u2026 Jklm was scummy in what he\u2019d done to then (very little) so it helped him say more, he gets worse as he posts more.<br>7.)\tPeople on L-1 should claim. This is my policy regardless of how I read them-you see other people have votes too. I still read him as town but nobody else did therefore he should claim to avoid town being lynched.<br>8.)\tAttack on a scummy target*. If you\u2019re saying bad/scummy people can\u2019t be scum then\u2026<br><br>Jklm is not a policy lynch. Why do you insist on defending him.<br><br>Jake- why is jklm town?</div></blockquote><br><br>1. no I used the joke to rvs vote you, if you seriously thought i scum read you because you played along with my joke then you sir are the one who is bad. As I said I was going to vote whoever said \"who's there\" as a reaction test. I vote you and you start tailspinning<br>2. not a good enough reason, plus I haven't even seen you make a solid case on anyone until you attempted to make one day 2 on jklm, day 1 you didn't really do that so I'm not buying it.<br>3. anyone who does a list read is doing it to earn town cred, that is my firm belief and what I felt you were trying to do<br>4. what she did wasn't scummy or even bad. There is no rule that says people have to participate in rvs. I agree the point of rvs is to start the game off and occasionally you catch someone doing something scummy which generates discussion, that happened this game with you but there is no rule that says each person has to. The fact that she made a point to say she wasn't going to participate immediately drew attention to her, which is something scum isn't typically going to do. Thus she is probably town and your attack on her makes you look bad.<br>5. You voted me because I thought list reads were bad, this came out when I dropped my town read on slandaar. It's absolutely related to slandaar and it's a horrible reason to vote someone. <br>6. Please explain how jklm was scummier than the other people lurking. Username/peregine/Zeus. 4 people basically doing the same shit.<br>7. people at L-1 should claim when someone gives intent to hammer, not just because they are at L-1 because there is a chance someone can change their mind or the player can convince someone to remove their vote. You asking someone you think is \"kind of town\" is bad.<br>8. I am saying bad/scummy doesn't automatically mean scum, but if someone does enough bad/scummy things they should be lynched. Without having role related information you can't ever been 100% sure of someone's alignment. All you can do is make a case and show why their repeated bad/scummy actions makes them possibly scum. someone doing 1 scummy thing doesn't guarantee they are scum. But way to try and trist my words Slandaar Jr<br><br><br>If JKLM is not a policy lynch please explain to me and everyone else why he is scummier than Peregine/username/zeus as all 4 of them have lurked and played like shit. What specifically has JKLM done that makes him more likely to flip scum then those 3.<br><br>JKLM is probably town because of slandaar's horrible attack on him and I am pretty sure slandaar is scum and I don't see this as bussing."}

As I said I was going to vote whoever said \"who's there\" as a reaction test. I vote you and you start tailspinning<br>2. not a good enough reason, plus I haven't even seen you make a solid case on anyone until you attempted to make one day 2 on jklm, day 1 you didn't really do that so I'm not buying it.<br>3. anyone who does a list read is doing it to earn town cred, that is my firm belief and what I felt you were trying to do<br>4. what she did wasn't scummy or even bad. There is no rule that says people have to participate in rvs. I agree the point of rvs is to start the game off and occasionally you catch someone doing something scummy which generates discussion, that happened this game with you but there is no rule that says each person has to. The fact that she made a point to say she wasn't going to participate immediately drew attention to her, which is something scum isn't typically going to do. Thus she is probably town and your attack on her makes you look bad.<br>5. You voted me because I thought list reads were bad, this came out when I dropped my town read on slandaar. It's absolutely related to slandaar and it's a horrible reason to vote someone. <br>6. Please explain how jklm was scummier than the other people lurking. Username/peregine/Zeus. 4 people basically doing the same shit.<br>7. people at L-1 should claim when someone gives intent to hammer, not just because they are at L-1 because there is a chance someone can change their mind or the player can convince someone to remove their vote. You asking someone you think is \"kind of town\" is bad.<br>8. I am saying bad/scummy doesn't automatically mean scum, but if someone does enough bad/scummy things they should be lynched. Without having role related information you can't ever been 100% sure of someone's alignment. All you can do is make a case and show why their repeated bad/scummy actions makes them possibly scum. someone doing 1 scummy thing doesn't guarantee they are scum. But way to try and trist my words Slandaar Jr<br><br><br>If JKLM is not a policy lynch please explain to me and everyone else why he is scummier than Peregine/username/zeus as all 4 of them have lurked and played like shit. What specifically has JKLM done that makes him more likely to flip scum then those 3.<br><br>JKLM is probably town because of slandaar's horrible attack on him and I am pretty sure slandaar is scum and I don't see this as bussing.</div></blockquote><br><br><br>1.)\tYour joke has no humour, mine does, yet you think only yours is a joke\u2026<br>2.)\tI have a set of reads now, not making a big case doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t.<br>3.)\tThe only person with an opinion about lists being town/scum rather than null is you. Posting a list read would thus increase how scummy I looked on average. Though I\u2019ve gone through why they are null<br>4.)\tIt was scummy. It was bad.<br>5.)\tWrong again.<br>6.)\tI\u2019ve gone through everything already.<br>7.)\tPeople hammer people on L-1 a lot.

Everything they have done looks scummy.<br><br>You acknowledge I\u2019ve gone through everything he said then want me to explain why he\u2019s scummy?

I guess you can try and take it to the list mod to see if she will do anything. <br><br>Sorry to say but Force replacing me is the only way you are getting me to leave this game.

Look at the game. Slandaar and Jake's argument probably contributed to why most people aren't posting. At the time he replaced out, I was pushing an out of reality case on him. I can see how many of these things genuinely caused him to ragequit. Being scum, he wouldn't replace out. He would use the Slandaar/Jake argument to his advantage since it caused many players to not contribute by pushing a strong case against PeregrineV like he wanted. Or he can make a strong case towards me. But he did neither and chose to ragequit. You can see even in his response to me, he didn't accuse me of lying about a result on him. Instead, he said I voted for him because of some insane idea that makes no sense."}

The probability of the masons actually being scum is like ...4% or so (making this shit up as I go).   The probability of there being 5 town power roles in a mini normal is like .... 4% or so (source: I design setups and have reviewed normals).  Slandaar is probably actually a Tracker, just mafia.  His case against Jake reads honest.  Like I said before, he made the better points against Jake.  He seems genuinely frustrated that Jake is not getting wagoned over his bad logic (just roll with me on that, Slandaar clearly believev it is whether or not it actually is). Note that this doesn't mean slandaar is town.  In fact, him hiding behind all of this noise and emotion and tunneling Jake without looking elsewhere is a very convenient way to blend in as scum.  I realize that tunneling on people is something Slandaar does as either alignment (and in fact made this same point in GoW mafia), but this feels less genuine from him.  When he is town, he will try to talk to people or relate to them.  I think somebody pointed out that he isn't actually trying to get Jake lynched.  This is how I feel about his push right now; it looks invested and he makes good points, but he isn't really making an effort to be protown or work with people.  Also, his claim basically makes him 2x more likely to be mafia if I accept the mason claims as town.<br><br>--<br><br>Can we at least get a replacement for SoZ today?

ESPECIALLY if I die and Hop/Yiley gop aboard the Zeus train and ride it to town.<br><br>P-p-edit:  I'm suggesting that my reads might be wrong, yes :S.  Except I am fairly confident about the Slandaar one because I see scum-motive in his play and also setup reasons to doubt his role being town.<br><br>I see (You, PV, Zeus, Jake, Duck, username) as having 2 scum in it (assuming Sland scum).  so lynching you or PV is like 1/3 chance of hitting scum.  And PV is somebody I lean town on anyhow, so what?  Where is this 50-50 coming from."}

Now take this and reason to yourself that I am town, and vote peregrine."}

The probability of there being 5 town power roles in a mini normal is like .... 4% or so (source: I design setups and have reviewed normals).  Slandaar is probably actually a Tracker, just mafia.  His case against Jake reads honest.  Like I said before, he made the better points against Jake.  He seems genuinely frustrated that Jake is not getting wagoned over his bad logic (just roll with me on that, Slandaar clearly believev it is whether or not it actually is). Note that this doesn't mean slandaar is town.  In fact, him hiding behind all of this noise and emotion and tunneling Jake without looking elsewhere is a very convenient way to blend in as scum.  I realize that tunneling on people is something Slandaar does as either alignment (and in fact made this same point in GoW mafia), but this feels less genuine from him.  When he is town, he will try to talk to people or relate to them.  I think somebody pointed out that he isn't actually trying to get Jake lynched.  This is how I feel about his push right now; it looks invested and he makes good points, but he isn't really making an effort to be protown or work with people.  Also, his claim basically makes him 2x more likely to be mafia if I accept the mason claims as town.<br></div></blockquote><br>Thanks for the story.

This is because scum made a conscious decision to not take the bait of targeting me after I hinted that I was odd night PR to avoid role claims on day 1.</div></blockquote><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5542256#p5542256\" class=\"postlink\">post 1377</a>, AngryPidgeon wrote:</cite>Why would Slandaar see Don as a threat?

I need to address you first because I'm sure you will find that your track attempt on {Me/Jake/Emo} turned up negative last night and you are frustrated and wanting to vote me.  Firstly, I know you to be town because your complete ambivalence toward the PV wagon could only come from someone who genuinely did not know PV was scum.  If you are scum, then I applaud your ability to not look it.  Presuming Emogirl is town and you scum, it would be suicide to ignore the PV wagon like that, especially sense you know she is gunning for you on the next day.  I suppose you/Emo could be a team, but I find it unlikely that Emo would thro-away such a strong lead by bussing BOTH buddies.  <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">I conclude that you are likely town aligned and will operate under that assumption for now.</span><br><br>Now lets talk about why the scumteam risked you getting a track guilty in favor of killing a mason.  You getting a track guilty is a pretty big ordeal.  Even if you get lynched today with one, that still means a scum is lynched on D4 and the game goes to 4p mylo.  That is a fairly favorable position for town considering that we started D2 off in a world of hurt.  I state with 100% certainty that you will have tracked within {Jake/Emo/AP} and gotten a negative result.  <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">It is completely ridiculous to assume that both remaining scum will be found in that group</span>.  For that to be true, both scum bussed PV and then put themselves at risk for being track-guiltied by you.  It is 100% silly to suggest that the scumteam took a strong D2 lead and risked throwing that to a 4p mylo situation that could be anyone's game.  I know I am town, but I also know that Emo/Jake are not a scumteam.  I hope you can reach the conclusion that I did here.  <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">One of Zeus/Username/Duck must be scum.</span>  They made the kill last night which was known to be safe from your eyes.  I agree that one of Jake/Emo is scum.<br><br>-Signed, AP<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #0000FF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">A Letter to the masses about my own actions and accountability:</span></span></span><br><br>When I first mentioned having <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5551032#p5551032\" class=\"postlink\">2 conspiracy theories</a> that was intentionally vague.  I owe you an explanation here first sense my behavior for the last stretch of D1 is certainly the exact opposite of Slandaar's which I said made him town.<br><br>The first theory is such.  Emogirl was an odd-night Tracker with a guilty on Peregrine.  I could see her being the type of player to not mention a guilty immediately or to sit the day out and see what actions/claims/associations happen.  Her insistence that she would <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5547243#p5547243\" class=\"postlink\">stake the game</a> on this flip eventually convinced me that <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">she KNEW PV must be scum</span>.  There was no way she would (as scum or town) say that unless she was certain since she is not someone to throw away her towncred as either alignment.  I divined that she might be an odd night tracker and had tracked PV on a whim and took the SIX claims on the field (odd tracker/even tracker /odd watcher/mason/mason/vig) to mean that one of them was lying and that that person was me/slandaar.  her zeal and insistence that she could solve the game led me tobelieve that she had a guilty on PV and assumed Slandaar was scum after that, taking us potentially o 1:6 and also getting a clear on someone on N3.<br><br>Now my 2nd theory is what I am currently throwing my money behind and it is this.<br><br>That emogirl was bussing Peregrine.  her motivation for doing so is obvious; PV is under suspicion already and wasn't really pulling weight very much.  Further, she could gain enough town cred from hard bussing him to lead the town for the rest of the game without coming under much suspicion.  Nobody would question why she was never NK'd either because there were 2 masons that would die before her anyhow.  Note that she only started hard bussing PV AFTER both <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5545096#p5545096\" class=\"postlink\">my</a> and the <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5545438#p5545438\" class=\"postlink\">mason</a> claims came out.

Mislynch Slandaar with my and Jake's help.<br>N3 Kill a mason<br>D4 Regardless of what I claim, mislynch me since Slandaar's flip will make me look bad and she could bust out a odd-night tracker claim on top of it to make her PV bus look legit and successfully mislynch me in 2:4 mylo to win the game here.<br><br>If you read my letter to slandaar, you will see why I don't think that Jake is on Emo's team here.  Slandaar _could_ be, but once again, I just have a hard time seeing that right now.  (Why hard bus both buddies when in a good position?)<br><br>Those were my two conspiracy theories.  I did and do believe that one of them is true which is why I busted out my pom-poms and cheerled the PV wagon all the way to town yesterday.  If Emo actually is town, then Slandaar is scum.  I pretty much believe that exactly one of them is and am inclined to think its Emo given Slandy's aura of cluelessness last game Day.<br><br>--<br>On my Pr Claim: I claimed PR immediately in hopes of getting shot at.

Of the three that could be a partner to Emo (Duck/Username/Zeus), the partner IS Duck.  I do not suspect that it is Duck, I know it is Duck.  There are a few points that may or may not seem important to you, but are quite important if taken together.<br><br>1. <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5527546#p5527546\" class=\"postlink\">Scumslipping</a>.

A lot.  And here we have these two right on the forefront of them, encouraging us to split votes on townies.<br><br>3. Given that Emo hard bussed the fuck out of PV, I strongly doubt her other buddy was left out to dry for town cred.  Its not me.  Its not jake.  Its not hopkirk.  <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5544546#p5544546\" class=\"postlink\">This post</a> is a bus.  He comes up with some arbitrary pool and hedges his way onto PV through....\"I dont wanna lynch Zeus, wah wah\", \"Slandaar's PR will be confirmable\", and \"AP might be scum but Im not going to touch him with a 11.5 foot pole\".  This post way too haphazardly winds up on PV for no real reason and shortly after emo goes into high gear and starts that wagon up as if PV did something worthy of being voted suddenly.  He didn't, and she didn't have a track guilty on him.  There is no scumhunting from Duck here.  Just some dumb PoE that happens to land on PV right before he gets hard driven into the ground?

I have answered them in advance for your reading pleasure.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>some idiot wrote:</cite>AP did you type that post up over the night?  how did you know you wouldn't get NK'd???</div></blockquote><br>Don't be a dumbass, there are claimed masons.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>emogirl wrote:</cite>Why would I bus PV when I could have won the game by letting you and Slandaar and Jake lynch each other ??!?</div></blockquote><br>Because you are <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5527643#p5527643\" class=\"postlink\">clever</a>.  Taking the easy route isn't interesting or grandiose enough for you.  Bussing PV and getting me/Slandaar chain lynched after, on the other hand?  More your style.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>somebody wrote:</cite>I dunno AP, this post of yours seems awfully opportunistic</div></blockquote><br>Shut the hell up.  If you want you can lynch me today.  I will self-vote on the condition that Duck and Emo both go after me with the remaining 2 lynches.<br><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>somebody wrote:</cite>What made you decide that emo is bussing PV instead of her being a tracker?</div></blockquote><br>Look at her ISO at the start of D2.  Did she talk to, mention, scumread, look for connections to, or ACKNOWLEDGE PV at all?  No.  Do you think she had a tracker guilty on him?  Neither do I.<br><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>emogirl wrote:</cite>If I am town, then who is scum?</div></blockquote><br>Duck/slandy.  So Duck is even more likely scum than you.  But Im lynching you first because you are a strong opponent; I cant trust these lemmings to lynch you without me screaming about it constantly.</div></div></div>"}

And later, telling someone (forgot who) to stfu and vote for PV. This makes me think that there is some sort of scum plan and emo was probably irritated at the speed, and wanted the lynch to happen quicker. Soon after she switches to Slandaar and then promptly switches back to PV in her next post. Not quite sure what to say about this, there could be many theories. I'm thinking possibly the next part of the plan or whatever.

But I don't know if that would even work out..<br><br>@peregrine: you have generated a nice list of posts, bit there is no actual analysis/conclusions.. this makes it a bit hard to discuss with you, could you type up a post in which you outline why you believe there should be scum on grey and who that might be?</div></blockquote><br>Also this looks like a scumslip, who else sees it.</div></blockquote><br>I assume you think this is a scumslip because I said parity cop instead of odd night tracker I believe?<br>I said the only role I could think of to know for sure that either one of those two people (slandaar and username) is scum was a parity cop, and even then it is assuming you get to send in two names on night one. Also, at no point did I call her an odd night anything.<br><br>The day 1 was indeed very bad for us and I did lead that lynch. I have outlined why I thought he was scum quite clearly and even when I read it back later, I can't find a point in the thread where I should have seen that he was town. (if you do, I'd love to talk about hat after the game)<br>Your third point is invalid in my opinion. I've been calling peregrine scummy quite some time before the post you quoted as an obvious bus. At the point that I wanted Peregrine dead Emo wanted to lynch SoZ, so there was no reason for me to bus Peregrine at that point unless I'm scum with her. I think we can agree that she is town. Then please explain how what I did makes sense from a scum perspective.<br>Your case on me is basically bad reading and lynching a townie D1<br><br>As for the rest of what happened today:<br>I don't like AP's shift in claims from watcher to BP, that role is unconfirmable by the tracker and is thus a safe claim by scum (with added bonus of no need to explain why you survived the night)<br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5589077#p5589077\">This</a> does not add up with the way his case is worded, although the case was written before that post, it is possible he developed his read on me. Only problem is, if that is true, why did I earn his vote, even though he doubts 1/3 of the reasons that make me scum?<br><br>Hermy's entrance into the thread is bad. She has a top scumread, but hasn't read more then the last page of her ISO?<br>She calls emo scum because she was over confident in her reads, but thats just playstyle. in this game and the other mini she played here she acted that confident all the time..<br>Her remark regarding the PR claim by AP is wrong as well. on top of the aforementioned things, what  Slandaar said is true as well, there is no need to retract your watcher claim if you truly are bulletproof, as you are quite likely to get shot tonight.<br><br>My gut reaction was to think AP is scum, but that didn't exactly work out with greygnarl either, so I'll refrain from voting him at this moment, but I'd like to discuss this a bit more. <br>I have quite some trouble deciding who is scum.<br>Yiley and Emo are absolutely town.<br>Mastin is most likely town because of Username.<br>Slandaar's claim makes sense with the godfather flip.<br>AP I really don't know.. his play today makes me feel like he's scum, but his play yesterday was very townie so I'm kind of lost here <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\"><br>Jake hasn't done much useful stuff, mostly fighting with slandaar, but he was very early with calling PV scummy, although calling him slightly scummy, and he doesn't really push for his lynch. (also, I would be very sad if his earlier \"Fuck off and die\" posts were a scum tactic to upset slandaar/get him to replace out)<br>Hermy had a bad opening and SoZ wasn't a townread. Plus, I feel like we got the night extension because one scum needed to be replaced.

Username never said why he replaced out and it really could have been for any number of reasons.  I fail to see why username being scum means that username would necessarily be interested in the game, ESPECIALLY if we assume he is scum with Slandaar.  Then he sort of has to think about the bullshit going on or process it mentally.  I just find this entire case for username-town to be completely silly.  Its based on assumption about username's personality, enjoyment of the game, ability to process strategies as scum, and sland/jake's alignments (if they were TvT I <span style=\"font-style: italic\">might</span> see some merit in what you are saying, MAYBE)<br><br>The fact that you actually believe this BULLSHIt is stunning when the rest of your posting shows that you in fact are a good player."}

So don't pull all that 'why me?' crap.<br>And I am NOT saying nothing. I'm contributing or at least attenpting to, because it's pretty hard when one knows that they're going to be bullied by someone like you in about two in every five posts. And I READ YOUR FUDGING ISO, stfu.<br>And requesting a policy lynch is just BLOODY IDIOTIC. Getting somebody you dislike and want to lynch due to I don't even know is STUPID. I repeat, STUPID. You want to go get us into MyLo/LyLo, just because of somebody you want to fully express your dislike of from the start, whether it's because of my vote on you or something else. I am, of course, pretty happy to just treat you as I treat anyone else in this game. But you know what? That feeling has completely diminished. You want to express hatred? I'll do so too. Great, what a lovely game. You're sure making this a nice experience for all of us.<br>Furthermore, my reasons for seeing you as scum still stand. I will use my vote only for who I see as scum. I see you are too immature for that. I saw your reluctancy to change your vote earlier, and don't pretend that your dumb bias had nothing to do with it.<br>Oh, and are there any more people you still want to get togather to gang up on me? I'm quite happy to take it all on.<br>You're going and basically calling me useless. And that's both harsh and untrue. While I'm certainly not the best at mafia, and I don't claim to be, useless is just going too damn far. Bully. But I CAN go prove you right, y'know? I may as well go and coast, maybe that way you'll get an opportunity to find a second person to bully too. You'd really like that, hm?<br>To be honest, I'd replace out right now if it wasn't for the fact that I've only just replaced in here. But I'm <span style=\"font-style: italic\">this</span> close to replacing out. And I mean it."}

But on the other hand, If Jake and Slandaar is TvT, we have also lost, even if we lynch me today, as I assume they are not going to suddenly do something else then voting the other one.<br>We'll go to no lynch or a mislynch then, next day they vote eachother again and we lose. In that regard lynching into them might be better.<br>But at the very least, we should wait with lynching until Hermy and Mastin are caught up and have had the time to give their thoughts on the game.<br>Also, it would be nice if Yiley joined the conversation a bit more, as he's confirmed town he should be able to put things in good perspective.<br><br>As for my current reads on everyone:<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Yiley</span>: Mason<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Emo</span>: I don't see any reason for her to bus PV at the point that she began to push him.

It seems like he is scumreading me only because of associations between unflipped players. Also, he really wants to lynch me, but doesn't vote for me at the moment. His current play feels a bit like he's flinging shit around just to see what sticks. But on the other hand, I don't think scum would defend Hermy in such an unrefined manner. I also liked his posting when he just replaced in. He's likely town.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Hermy</span> Had an bad entrance post and a fight with emo, not much else. I don't think her reaction to Emo was justified (reading half an ISO of one player in a 2000+ posts game and calling it passable is kind of weak). But then again, It is possible that their previous interaction was so bad that this was just the proverbial straw on the camel's back. All in all I think she is somewhat likely to be scum.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Mastin2</span> I don't know yet.

But on the other hand, he completely ignored the push on PV and tried to shift attention to AP and Emo.  I also don't like how all his cases are based on someone telling a blatant lie. Why would scum be telling lies that are easily verifiable? <br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Jake</span> First day he mostly argued over mafia theory (hopkirks thoughts on starting a game and scumminess of listposts) and completely ignored the push on grey (but he did make some offhand remarks that Grey was town) But on the other hand he is constantly trying to get people who want to lynch a lurker to consider PV as at least an equally good candidate. I don't see why he would do that as scum. <br><br>I left out the claiming of PR's out on purpose, as setup speculations just confuse me and I don't have enough experience to get any benefit from it.

I am really hesitant to vote for either one of them, because I'm getting lynched no matter what tomorrow I think. Either I have bussed my partner, or lynched a towny. So this is actually some sort of MYLO to me.<br>Ask yourself the following question: Am I confident in my abilty to find the two remaining scum, and getting them lynched back to back? If you answer yes to this, vote me.<br>If the answer is no, I think it's best to vote Slandaar, I chose him over Jake because this should also solve the \"there can't be so much PR's\" debate.<br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: Hermy</span><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Slandaar</span>"}

He also now has emo on his list but this is only after emo started voting pv.<br><br>I don't really see him say much about zeus at all and he spends most of the time focusing on emo/username<br><br>based on interactions I don't think username is scum as he diected more attention to him instead of emo.<br><br>pv/duck/emo is possible which puts mastin/ap is town pile.<br><br>Emo started pushing pv for no reason and still looks like a bus, I think it's possible that emo figured out that we probably had no cop and bussing the GF would give her town cred.<br><br>Also her 180 on the username slot doesn't make much sense to me, reaks of trying to buddy the replacement.<br><br>emo's iso was harder to go through but until the hard push on PV I never really saw anything that looked like a genuine push on pv, just a few off comments towards him trying to discredit him and I can't tell if that was genuine or not.<br><br>her post 1403 is pretty bad cause she concedes he's a pr but votes him anyway cause his performance.<br><br>2074 is another example of n00b scum. \"why me and why not someone else\" <br><br>if emo is scum I definitely don't think hermy is scum cause she never really provides good reasoning for him instead attacking what seems to be an easy target.<br><br>plus the Don nk points to emo scum, especially how she tried to use the Don kill to paint others as scum which is also what I expect from scum.<br><br><br>JKLM's iso is useless<br><br>AP - pretty sure AP and emo can't be scum together, though I have seen scum bus each other in mylo twice so it's still in the back of my mind as a possibility.<br><br>1599 - AP makes a good point that pv's vote and unvote would work if he and emo were buddies.<br><br>I find myself agreeing with a lot of things AP has said but that could just be being naive, also I don't think AP would have invited mastin to join the game if AP was scum, AP would invite mastin if AP was town imo so I think I can rule AP out as scum.<br><br><br>Duck - only thing that really stands out is he doesn't ever make a hard push toward pv and he voted him before anyone else did. This is where I get torn of a duck/emo team cause I don't see why scum emo would follow scum duck lynching their GF. Plus his vote on emo doesn't look like a bus to me<br><br>duck/emo doesn't seem likely though and neither does duck/hermy which really confuses the hell out of me. Duck could be town here which kind of throws me off.<br><br>I still need to read Zeus and I want content from hermy, I also still need to ISO username and zeus which I will do later.<br><br>i'd be ok voting emo today but still have more work to do."}

I need to address you first because I'm sure you will find that your track attempt on {Me/Jake/Emo} turned up negative last night and you are frustrated and wanting to vote me.  Firstly, I know you to be town because your complete ambivalence toward the PV wagon could only come from someone who genuinely did not know PV was scum.  If you are scum, then I applaud your ability to not look it.  Presuming Emogirl is town and you scum, it would be suicide to ignore the PV wagon like that, especially sense you know she is gunning for you on the next day.  I suppose you/Emo could be a team, but I find it unlikely that Emo would thro-away such a strong lead by bussing BOTH buddies.  <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">I conclude that you are likely town aligned and will operate under that assumption for now.</span><br><br>Now lets talk about why the scumteam risked you getting a track guilty in favor of killing a mason.  You getting a track guilty is a pretty big ordeal.  Even if you get lynched today with one, that still means a scum is lynched on D4 and the game goes to 4p mylo.  That is a fairly favorable position for town considering that we started D2 off in a world of hurt.  I state with 100% certainty that you will have tracked within {Jake/Emo/AP} and gotten a negative result.  <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">It is completely ridiculous to assume that both remaining scum will be found in that group</span>.  For that to be true, both scum bussed PV and then put themselves at risk for being track-guiltied by you.  It is 100% silly to suggest that the scumteam took a strong D2 lead and risked throwing that to a 4p mylo situation that could be anyone's game.  I know I am town, but I also know that Emo/Jake are not a scumteam.  I hope you can reach the conclusion that I did here.  <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">One of Zeus/Username/Duck must be scum.</span>  They made the kill last night which was known to be safe from your eyes.  I agree that one of Jake/Emo is scum.<br><br>-Signed, AP<br></div></blockquote><br>You tried to buddy Slandaar that phase and have me lynched. When Slandaar didn't comply, you voted for him. It's a bit off that you didn't consider that Slandaar could have been roleblocked. Slandaar even dropped hints at being roleblocked if I read his sarcasm right."}

This isn't a defense at all, really. It's an attempt to deflect onto something that Slandaar was right about: regardless of his alignment, his statement about thinking that's what JKLM did would be true, thus, it was not an intentional lie. But Jake used it as basically, \"Ha, you think I'm lying? Well, you're lying, too!\" When the \"lie\" between the two is entirely different. Jake's lie is in contradictory stances with no flow to them. They're all internal, relating to his own posts. Slandaar's 'lie' is in what he said not lining up to the facts of the thread--something easily attributed to simply misremembering things, and when the issue was brought up, Slandaar owned up and said, \"yes\". Whereas Jake when confronted with the lie goes into this vehement denial about it. Basically, Jake's attitude was to dismiss and deflect the case against him.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5501058#p5501058\" class=\"postlink\">post 668</a>, JKLM wrote:</cite><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: jake</span><br><br>Lazy scum has been caught, let's go go go, I have ever said anything about Ald before my vote so great going.

Because, bluntly, I came into this game expecting to die. When that didn't happen, I knew I'd have to do something. I was at the time in depression, though, so that messed me up, and for the life of me, I couldn't get a good read. On anyone. I still don't know who is scum despite being dead. It could be you, it could be pecan, it could be AP, hell, it could even be Nacho. Fuck, for all I know, it's emo. I simply could not get a good read. And it's right there in my posting. I tried keeping up with the game. But I was having trouble getting a grip. I tried figuring things out, yet no matter what, I continued coming up empty. Nothing. Everything was faked, yes. Because I have literally nothing. On anyone. Not through lack of effort. When I remembered about this game, you have my word that I was thinking. And thinking. Literally every damn minute I had. About it. And never. Never. Getting anywhere.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5651999#p5651999\" class=\"postlink\">post 3103</a>, AngryPidgeon wrote:</cite>So if mastin is it, I would say its between Emo/Jake.  </div></blockquote> I do hope you're scum, because if you seriously. For so much as one god-damned second. Think I would bus my god-damned scumbuddy in mylo. You don't know me at all. You know that I hate being the last scum. You know that I despise being alone, that I don't think I can pull it off.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5652575#p5652575\" class=\"postlink\">post 3138</a>, AngryPidgeon wrote:</cite>I can feel the disdain for his role PM in every word he posts.</div></blockquote> Disdain, yes. At my role PM, no. At myself. <br><br>I'll take 90% of the blame for the loss, right here, right now. Because there is all sorts of things that I should have done but didn't. I shouldn't have accepted. I should have read during the night, chance of being nightkilled be damned. I should have offered to replace out when I realized I was having trouble getting reads. I should have kept caught up, instead of giving up on keeping up and going along. I should have given every single spare moment of my time, even if that only meant progressing my readthrough one post at a time, rather than insisting on setting aside a batch of time to do so. I should have followed through on what little feelings I did have in the game, in spite of how weak they were. I should have, but didn't. That's all on me.<br><br>But you cannot with a straight face claim that there was not town in me. Not much. Oh, that's another bit; I should have had far more of a strong presence in the game so that the towniness would be more evident. But no matter how subtle, the signs were there. And if you were town, you missed them. Entirely and completely. You of all people know what I've been through. And while I've overcome the depression, that doesn't mean there haven't been lingering effects. Fallout from the bomb. In this case, being an utter lack of ability to comprehensively maintain consistency this game.<br><br>As I said. I can see any of you. Literally any of you. As being scum. Despite knowing full good and well only two are. I'm thinking pecan's one. But that's weak-as-hell. Like I said. I have nothing. I had nothing. I said as much. And my efforts this game have been focused on fixing that. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5652590#p5652590\" class=\"postlink\">post 3144</a>, AngryPidgeon wrote:</cite>I don't know, he wasn't even very committal about it.

If I was scum, you damn-well know I can fake having a god-damned opinion on a player in mylo, even a blind mylo. The fact that I didn't should have been a MASSIVE tip-off. That, maybe. Just maybe. I was town. Who can't force an opinion. Who can't make something out of nothing. Who has to find that something, and was struggling. Fighting and failing. To get it. It started with the depression. It then progressed into me simply being lost. I tried. You saw me trying. It was right there. And that's why I'm basically hoping you're scum. Because if you were town, you mislynched me...for something you damn-well knew wasn't a scumtell, but rather, a mental health tell. Or if anything, a towntell. When was the last time I-as-scum showed no true inclination towards lynching a player? I don't think it's ever happened, because a scum-me ALWAYS has a plan. A scum me ALWAYS has something up his sleeve. A scum me even when entirely out of the game can still create some way to win. That wasn't here. Because this isn't my scum me.

And I was setting aside literally the entirety of my day for this game. I was going to come in. (I came home early from work today, even.) Skip lunch, maybe even skip supper, maybe even skip the god-damned super-bowl despite the Seahawks being in it, for MS.net games, and resist the urge to get distracted by art or video games. Prod-dodge post in other games. And focus the entirety of my effort in reading the remaining 95 or so pages in the game. One damn day is all I needed.<br><br>Yes, I squandered previous opportunities. As I said...fallout from the depression. I needed to work out a schedule. There are things that I needed to get done. I tried my best to manage my time, so that I could have the opportunity to do so. But this is not a skill I inherently possess. I did what I could to prioritize things effectively and maximize my time, but obstacles and shortcomings that I hadn't accounted for kept interfering, and my mindset of \"all or nothing\" got in the way. Thus the blame. I should have replaced out because of the time management issue. I should have better organized so that I would have a failsafe. I should have adapted a \"do what I can when I can\" mentality instead of the doomed-to-fail 'all-or-nothing' one. All on me. But no. I did not give no effort. I did not not-try. I should have given more time/effort. Yet they were already there, having done nothing. I should have conveyed this better, that yes. I was having trouble getting a grip. That yes. I was lost. That, yes. I had no clue what I was doing. That, yes. I had no real opinions. That, yes, I wasn't keeping up. That part's also on me. <br><br>And, yes, I was going in entirely unbiased. I cleared my head of an AP-Jake scumteam. I cleared my head of you being town. I cleared my head of everything, to try and get solidified grounding, rather than the nothingness I had before, which still had biases based off of nothing but emotional quick-reactions rather than actual solid basing. <br><br>But these things being present? Huge fucking tip-off. It's my fault for not emphasizing them enough. (I believe I didn't out of fear that they'd be used to scumread me.)

Those things peak into Mastin as a person. Never the player. Never the alignment. Emo was the only one who seemed to pick up on these things.
