Great, booming cities held millions of people with law and order.<br>\n<br>\nThe world has changed since then, with overpopulation and war causing the world to gradually descend into chaos.<br>\n<br>\nThe remaining people who still held faith banded together and created the walled city of Cadus. Within its walls, they outlasted the storm.<br>\n<br>\nWith peace and justice as the cornerstone of their lives, Cadus's people flourished, but its sanctuary was not to last.<br>\n<br>\nYears slowly crept past, darkness reached its hideous roots within the fortifications, and the death and despair once walled out seeped in.<br>\n<br>\nThe blood of innocents washed the streets. The screams of dying children were heard in the tenebrous gloom.<br>\n<br>\nAs the fall of Cadus reaches its zenith, the last thirteen people band together.<br>\n<br>\nIt has begun.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nRules of Anarchy:<br>\n1) All decisions come down to a democracy. The moderator gets 14 votes.<br>\n2) Please use vote tags to place your votes. Bold tags are also acceptable.<br>\n3) Lynches will occur when one player has received the majority of votes. You may post during the twilight period between the hammer and the closing of the thread.<br>\n4) If unsufficient votes are made on any player, or a majority of votes have been made to no lynch, no lynch will be made.<br>\n5) Nights will last 48 hours.<br>\n6) Do NOT quote any private communication from me, nor any mason, scum, or neighbour topics that may or may not exist. You may paraphrase, just don't copy it wholesale.<br>\n7) You MAY NOT discuss the game outside of the thread unless your role specifically gives you the ability to do so.<br>\n8) Days will last 2 weeks, or until a lynch (or no lynch) has been decided on.<br>\n9) <div style=\"display:inline;color:blue\">Blue is my color.</div> Refrain from using it.<br>\n10) Inform the mod before going V/LA. I will prod you after 48 hours of inactivity, and then again after 24 hours. At that point, I will be forced to replace you.<br>\n11) In the tragic event I drop off the face of the earth, a backup moderator will take my place.<br>\n12) In the event a deadline is reached, it will become a no lynch by default.<br>\n13) Once you die, you're dead. You are allowed one \"bah!\" post, but no more than one, and it must contain no game related content.<br>\n14) The rules can be arbitrarily changed/added to by one party (me) anytime I am feeling greedy and/or evil.<br>\n15) Be nice, and try to enjoy yourself.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: Sample Role PM</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\">Welcome to the fall, PLAYERNAME!<br>\n<br>\nYou are a Citizen.

Let's try starting here.<br>\n<br>\nAlduskkel has made a total of three votes:<br>\n\n<ul>\n<li>1. <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5482313#p5482313\" class=\"postlink\">Hopkirk</a> was the first RVS vote. This has no significance and is only natural that he drops the vote eventually.<br>\n<br>\n2. <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5482984#p5482984\" class=\"postlink\">Yiley</a> was his second vote, and this vote has a reasoning. He explicitly stated that the reason for his second vote was to prod Yiley in giving more than one-liners.<br>\n<br>\n3. <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5483549#p5483549\" class=\"postlink\">Jake from State Farm</a> was his third vote, and again this vote has a reasoning. Stating that he has a feel for a bunch of players being \"town\", placing the vote has no other intention other than another prod on Jake.</li>\n</ul>\n\nMy scum hunting methodologies for Day 1 is as always to find the most neutral of players. Two out of three of his votes explicitly state that the reasoning was not suspicion, but to prod for information. This can be seen when he removed the vote from Yiley and placed it on Jake. What this accomplishes is the facade of voting without generating any new information. Therefore, maintaining his neutrality.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">I am waiting on a follow-up with The-Duck for Alduskkel's <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5483549#p5483549\" class=\"postlink\">second</a> question, and Alduskkel's response, so let's not talk about that right now.</div><br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5484061#p5484061\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5484061#p5484061\" data-post-id=\"5484061\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 133</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10070\">Alduskkel</a> wrote:</cite>I feel like Hopkirk's case on emogirl would be good if emogirl were actually doing what he was accusing her of doing, but emogirl seems to be participating just fine so I see no issue there.</div></blockquote>\nMaking this claim while not taking a stance is a flag for me.

He does not push Slandaar to reason his vote (which by the way, needs to happen), and he does not push Jake to reason his vote on Hopkirk, as he did raise good points as to why Jake's reasoning is flawed.

She stated that she wanted to see my reaction, and I was curious how a different reaction would have lead to a read one way or another.</div></blockquote>Hopkirk was not under pressure, because RVS wagons do not carry to lynch, people were talking about a joke made in RVS, if that turned into an actual wagon then god help me. emo is/was kind of under pressure since she was being grilled, but not really. I said you were pressuring her because she was under the most pressure, which does not mean that it's a sizable amount of pressure at all.

We were pushing for two townies to be lynched, so scum didn't really have the need to contribute.<br>\nWith this in mind, there are two people who stuck out to me big time.<br>\nJake, for <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5499685#p5499685\">617</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5499785#p5499785\">632</a>, combined with <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5504883#p5504883\">746</a> makes him look quite bad in my opinion.<br>\nI'd think that if you have a strong scumread and people are lynching someone without good reason (in your eyes) you would either try to clear up why the lynch candidate is either scummy or not, or you try to convince people that your scumread is a better lynch option then the current ones. My biggest problem with jake being scum is that I read his last couple of posts as really genuine and an honest apology, which makes it fairly believable that he was too focused/tunneled on slandaar to care about the other lynches.<br>\n<br>\nThe other player who stuck out is Yiley. Although he talks about the lynch and says he's fine with either Ald or Grey he never explains why, and at lynch he ends up on neither of them. In fact, I don't believe he has given his thoughts on anything; when he gets asked for them he responds with person x said it better, just read that! Which is scummy to me because it makes it easy to shift blame/pressure towards the person you are sheeping.<br>\n<br>\nAlso, I can see possible scum motivation in Peregrine taking forever to catch up, he has now said 2-3 times hes catching up, but nothing comes out of it.<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Yiley</span>", "time": "Wed Dec 11, 2013 1:05 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=34150&start=875", "forum": "53", "thread": "34150"}

Him immediately using things like circular logic and fallacies seems like someone who is being defensive (yes I realize town can be defensive too) when he didn't need to be. <br>\n<br>\n2. I feel like most of his posts are attempts to look busy without any actual scum hunting and when I stopped pushing on him his activity seemed to slow down and dropped back under the radar<br>\n<br>\n3. The fact he made a list read after the whole debate about list reads looks forced, it's like he was going to do it to spite me and hope he earned town cred for it<br>\n<br>\n4. His early attack on emo for not wanting to participate in rvs was also bad. Even if emo didn't intend it to be a reaction test, I know it is one cause I have done it before myself and his reaction was bad. <br>\n<br>\n5. If and this is a HUGE IF, slandaar is town, there is obvious buddying with slandaar. When he first voted me it was right after I dropped my town read on slandaar, which looks like he is sticking up for him. He didn't even bother to find out if my opinion was legit or not. I think a townie would have at least done that. Not to mention he seems to take slandaar's side more than mine.<br>\n<br>\n6. The very first time he mentions JKLM is in post 488 when he says jklm IS scum and votes him. Never explains why, never gives a single reason and later in post 511 cites to <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5487921#p5487921\" class=\"postlink\">This post</a> and says this heavily implies jklm has read the game and knows what is going on. imo I completely disagree, him saying he \"likes the game\" doesn't imply anything at all nor does it imply he is caught up. He basically latches onto slandaar's original suspicion and runs with it. <br>\n<br>\n7. in post 488 he says grey could be town, and the next time he mentions him he says he should be claiming. 1. if he is town why is he asking him to claim? 2. if his read changed then why hasn't he mentioned it? no that looks like scum ready for a mislynch and is role fishing. <br>\n<br>\n8. 942 is his big post trying to paint jklm as scum but all I see when I look at it is an attack on an easy target.<br>\n<br>\nThere is my case on Hop.<br>\n<br>\nmaybe tomorrow I will do one for slandaar", "time": "Tue Dec 17, 2013 1:03 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=34150&start=1125", "forum": "53", "thread": "34150"}

Thinks Ald is scummy cause he questions slandaar's townie ness? I see a pattern here cause that's 2 people he puts into the scummy pile for doing that. Me and ald. There is no town motivation for that imo. Says hopsy is scummy but in an earlier post looked like he was buddying him and the remaining 3 players were lurkers. <br>\n<br>\nso 5 scummy suspects, 3 lurkers, 1 idk and 1 who questioned his townieness.

Claims a PR and forces the other PR to confirm him, even though there is no gurantee that the either is actually town and when the other PR does confirm him, he acts like she never did it and plays dumb about it.<br>\n<br>\n10. Still pushes policy lynches but calls them scum lynches. Don't get me wrong I LOVE a good polcy lynch but call it one. Being afraid to call it a policy lynch is someone who is afraid of how they are perceived. <br>\n<br>\nFACT. JKLM is a policy lynch. Iamusername is a policy lynch. They both could be scum but the reasons that slandaar wants to lynch them are not reasons that gurantee alignment. Being afraid to call it what it actually is means he is more likely to be scum because scum wouldn't want the attention. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\nThat is all I got, gotta run to go to dinner.<br>\n<br>\ndeuces</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\nBelow is my sort of case on Peregine<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: </b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\">I will admit that the peregine read came from way to many prod dodges to be expected from a townie.

As I said I was going to vote whoever said \"who's there\" as a reaction test. I vote you and you start tailspinning<br>\n2. not a good enough reason, plus I haven't even seen you make a solid case on anyone until you attempted to make one day 2 on jklm, day 1 you didn't really do that so I'm not buying it.<br>\n3. anyone who does a list read is doing it to earn town cred, that is my firm belief and what I felt you were trying to do<br>\n4. what she did wasn't scummy or even bad. There is no rule that says people have to participate in rvs. I agree the point of rvs is to start the game off and occasionally you catch someone doing something scummy which generates discussion, that happened this game with you but there is no rule that says each person has to. The fact that she made a point to say she wasn't going to participate immediately drew attention to her, which is something scum isn't typically going to do. Thus she is probably town and your attack on her makes you look bad.<br>\n5. You voted me because I thought list reads were bad, this came out when I dropped my town read on slandaar. It's absolutely related to slandaar and it's a horrible reason to vote someone. <br>\n6. Please explain how jklm was scummier than the other people lurking. Username/peregine/Zeus. 4 people basically doing the same shit.<br>\n7. people at L-1 should claim when someone gives intent to hammer, not just because they are at L-1 because there is a chance someone can change their mind or the player can convince someone to remove their vote. You asking someone you think is \"kind of town\" is bad.<br>\n8. I am saying bad/scummy doesn't automatically mean scum, but if someone does enough bad/scummy things they should be lynched. Without having role related information you can't ever been 100% sure of someone's alignment. All you can do is make a case and show why their repeated bad/scummy actions makes them possibly scum. someone doing 1 scummy thing doesn't guarantee they are scum. But way to try and trist my words Slandaar Jr<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nIf JKLM is not a policy lynch please explain to me and everyone else why he is scummier than Peregine/username/zeus as all 4 of them have lurked and played like shit.

As I said I was going to vote whoever said \"who's there\" as a reaction test. I vote you and you start tailspinning<br>\n2. not a good enough reason, plus I haven't even seen you make a solid case on anyone until you attempted to make one day 2 on jklm, day 1 you didn't really do that so I'm not buying it.<br>\n3. anyone who does a list read is doing it to earn town cred, that is my firm belief and what I felt you were trying to do<br>\n4. what she did wasn't scummy or even bad. There is no rule that says people have to participate in rvs. I agree the point of rvs is to start the game off and occasionally you catch someone doing something scummy which generates discussion, that happened this game with you but there is no rule that says each person has to. The fact that she made a point to say she wasn't going to participate immediately drew attention to her, which is something scum isn't typically going to do. Thus she is probably town and your attack on her makes you look bad.<br>\n5. You voted me because I thought list reads were bad, this came out when I dropped my town read on slandaar. It's absolutely related to slandaar and it's a horrible reason to vote someone. <br>\n6. Please explain how jklm was scummier than the other people lurking. Username/peregine/Zeus. 4 people basically doing the same shit.<br>\n7. people at L-1 should claim when someone gives intent to hammer, not just because they are at L-1 because there is a chance someone can change their mind or the player can convince someone to remove their vote. You asking someone you think is \"kind of town\" is bad.<br>\n8. I am saying bad/scummy doesn't automatically mean scum, but if someone does enough bad/scummy things they should be lynched. Without having role related information you can't ever been 100% sure of someone's alignment. All you can do is make a case and show why their repeated bad/scummy actions makes them possibly scum. someone doing 1 scummy thing doesn't guarantee they are scum.

The difference between what you and I did, is I actually explained why your reasonings for me and JKLM were bad. I even proved to you that your reasoning for JKLM were null tells. If you actually provided reasonings for username I could actually decide if your case makes sense or not but I don't recall you ever making a case for him. If you did can you please link it or repost it like I have been trying to get you to do? Thank you.<br>\n<br>\nNOW - Did you do that for any of my reasonings for Hopkirk or Peregune? no you didn't. You just said \"I don't agree with them\" like a child because that is what you THOUGHT I did. <br>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>FACT: Sland says: then I have also explained, you therefore lied suggesting I have not.<br>\nFACT: Jake throws tantrum because he has been caught again.</div></blockquote>\n\nI didn't lie and I am not throwing a tantrum. Ignoring you because you won't respond to my requests and you intentionally try to misrep the things I say isn't throwing a tantrum. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\nInside the spoiler is the evidence that shows I actually attempted to explain why Slandaar's reasonings for JKLM were bad.

I guess you can try and take it to the list mod to see if she will do anything. <br>\n<br>\nSorry to say but Force replacing me is the only way you are getting me to leave this game.

I will assume that he gave me a town read for Day 1 prior to his exit from the game. Under this assumption, a town read of his for most of the game, that is also one of the more active players in this game, just dropped a case on him for a seemingly insane thought process. He did not respond to this with aggression, or retaliate with a vote on any of the weaker and easily manipulatable players to appear as a solid town player when I am certain he has the ability to do so. I was certain of my case, but it is a case where only I am certain he has the highest probability to be scum from my perspective. It is a case where there is no direct response to the reasons, but could only be responded to with actions.<br>\n<br>\nHis action was to rage quit? Scum is absolutely enjoy the hell out of Slandaar and Jake draining everyone's motivation to play.

Look at the game. Slandaar and Jake's argument probably contributed to why most people aren't posting. At the time he replaced out, I was pushing an out of reality case on him. I can see how many of these things genuinely caused him to ragequit. Being scum, he wouldn't replace out. He would use the Slandaar/Jake argument to his advantage since it caused many players to not contribute by pushing a strong case against PeregrineV like he wanted. Or he can make a strong case towards me. But he did neither and chose to ragequit. You can see even in his response to me, he didn't accuse me of lying about a result on him.

Your defence of Hopkirk is that he is not playing well enough to see that his case on JKLM does not have any reasoning behind it at all.

Slandaar/username/emo team?  &lt;--- I realize I change my mind every time I post, and this is why I want to lynch Slandaar.  The probability of the masons actually being scum is like ...4% or so (making this shit up as I go).   The probability of there being 5 town power roles in a mini normal is like .... 4% or so (source: I design setups and have reviewed normals).  Slandaar is probably actually a Tracker, just mafia.  His case against Jake reads honest.  Like I said before, he made the better points against Jake.  He seems genuinely frustrated that Jake is not getting wagoned over his bad logic (just roll with me on that, Slandaar clearly believev it is whether or not it actually is). Note that this doesn't mean slandaar is town.  In fact, him hiding behind all of this noise and emotion and tunneling Jake without looking elsewhere is a very convenient way to blend in as scum.  I realize that tunneling on people is something Slandaar does as either alignment (and in fact made this same point in GoW mafia), but this feels less genuine from him.  When he is town, he will try to talk to people or relate to them.  I think somebody pointed out that he isn't actually trying to get Jake lynched.  This is how I feel about his push right now; it looks invested and he makes good points, but he isn't really making an effort to be protown or work with people.  Also, his claim basically makes him 2x more likely to be mafia if I accept the mason claims as town.<br>\n<br>\n--<br>\n<br>\nCan we at least get a replacement for SoZ today?

The probability of the masons actually being scum is like ...4% or so (making this shit up as I go).   The probability of there being 5 town power roles in a mini normal is like .... 4% or so (source: I design setups and have reviewed normals).  Slandaar is probably actually a Tracker, just mafia.  His case against Jake reads honest.  Like I said before, he made the better points against Jake.  He seems genuinely frustrated that Jake is not getting wagoned over his bad logic (just roll with me on that, Slandaar clearly believev it is whether or not it actually is). Note that this doesn't mean slandaar is town.  In fact, him hiding behind all of this noise and emotion and tunneling Jake without looking elsewhere is a very convenient way to blend in as scum.  I realize that tunneling on people is something Slandaar does as either alignment (and in fact made this same point in GoW mafia), but this feels less genuine from him.  When he is town, he will try to talk to people or relate to them.  I think somebody pointed out that he isn't actually trying to get Jake lynched.  This is how I feel about his push right now; it looks invested and he makes good points, but he isn't really making an effort to be protown or work with people.  Also, his claim basically makes him 2x more likely to be mafia if I accept the mason claims as town.\n</div></blockquote>\nThanks for the story.

AP has solved this game after a few hours of soul searching.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#0000FF\"><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">A letter to Slandaar</div></div>:<br>\n<br>\nI think we got off on the wrong foot; I want to offer you an olive branch today.  I need to address you first because I'm sure you will find that your track attempt on {Me/Jake/Emo} turned up negative last night and you are frustrated and wanting to vote me.  Firstly, I know you to be town because your complete ambivalence toward the PV wagon could only come from someone who genuinely did not know PV was scum.  If you are scum, then I applaud your ability to not look it.  Presuming Emogirl is town and you scum, it would be suicide to ignore the PV wagon like that, especially sense you know she is gunning for you on the next day.  I suppose you/Emo could be a team, but I find it unlikely that Emo would thro-away such a strong lead by bussing BOTH buddies.  <div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">I conclude that you are likely town aligned and will operate under that assumption for now.</div><br>\n<br>\nNow lets talk about why the scumteam risked you getting a track guilty in favor of killing a mason.  You getting a track guilty is a pretty big ordeal.  Even if you get lynched today with one, that still means a scum is lynched on D4 and the game goes to 4p mylo.  That is a fairly favorable position for town considering that we started D2 off in a world of hurt.  I state with 100% certainty that you will have tracked within {Jake/Emo/AP} and gotten a negative result.  <div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">It is completely ridiculous to assume that both remaining scum will be found in that group</div>.  For that to be true, both scum bussed PV and then put themselves at risk for being track-guiltied by you.  It is 100% silly to suggest that the scumteam took a strong D2 lead and risked throwing that to a 4p mylo situation that could be anyone's game.  I know I am town, but I also know that Emo/Jake are not a scumteam.  I hope you can reach the conclusion that I did here.  <div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">One of Zeus/Username/Duck must be scum.</div>  They made the kill last night which was known to be safe from your eyes.  I agree that one of Jake/Emo is scum.<br>\n<br>\n-Signed, AP<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#0000FF\">A Letter to the masses about my own actions and accountability:</div></div><br>\n<br>\nWhen I first mentioned having <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5551032#p5551032\" class=\"postlink\">2 conspiracy theories</a> that was intentionally vague.  I owe you an explanation here first sense my behavior for the last stretch of D1 is certainly the exact opposite of Slandaar's which I said made him town.<br>\n<br>\nThe first theory is such.  Emogirl was an odd-night Tracker with a guilty on Peregrine.  I could see her being the type of player to not mention a guilty immediately or to sit the day out and see what actions/claims/associations happen.  Her insistence that she would <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5547243#p5547243\" class=\"postlink\">stake the game</a> on this flip eventually convinced me that <div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">she KNEW PV must be scum</div>.  There was no way she would (as scum or town) say that unless she was certain since she is not someone to throw away her towncred as either alignment.  I divined that she might be an odd night tracker and had tracked PV on a whim and took the SIX claims on the field (odd tracker/even tracker /odd watcher/mason/mason/vig) to mean that one of them was lying and that that person was me/slandaar.  her zeal and insistence that she could solve the game led me tobelieve that she had a guilty on PV and assumed Slandaar was scum after that, taking us potentially o 1:6 and also getting a clear on someone on N3.<br>\n<br>\nNow my 2nd theory is what I am currently throwing my money behind and it is this.<br>\n<br>\nThat emogirl was bussing Peregrine.  her motivation for doing so is obvious; PV is under suspicion already and wasn't really pulling weight very much.  Further, she could gain enough town cred from hard bussing him to lead the town for the rest of the game without coming under much suspicion.  Nobody would question why she was never NK'd either because there were 2 masons that would die before her anyhow.  Note that she only started hard bussing PV AFTER both <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5545096#p5545096\" class=\"postlink\">my</a> and the <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5545438#p5545438\" class=\"postlink\">mason</a> claims came out.  Presumably her plan would be roughly this:<br>\n<br>\nD2 Bus PV for credit, kill a mason.<br>\nD3 .... And this is where I speculate a bit.  Mislynch Slandaar with my and Jake's help.<br>\nN3 Kill a mason<br>\nD4 Regardless of what I claim, mislynch me since Slandaar's flip will make me look bad and she could bust out a odd-night tracker claim on top of it to make her PV bus look legit and successfully mislynch me in 2:4 mylo to win the game here.<br>\n<br>\nIf you read my letter to slandaar, you will see why I don't think that Jake is on Emo's team here.  Slandaar _could_ be, but once again, I just have a hard time seeing that right now.  (Why hard bus both buddies when in a good position?)<br>\n<br>\nThose were my two conspiracy theories.  I did and do believe that one of them is true which is why I busted out my pom-poms and cheerled the PV wagon all the way to town yesterday.  If Emo actually is town, then Slandaar is scum.  I pretty much believe that exactly one of them is and am inclined to think its Emo given Slandy's aura of cluelessness last game Day.<br>\n<br>\n--<br>\nOn my Pr Claim: I claimed PR immediately in hopes of getting shot at.  That isn't going to happen it would seem, so I will leave you all with that.<br>\n<br>\n-Signed, AP<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#0000FF\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">A note regarding rabbit season</div></div>:<br>\n<br>\nIt is most certainly duck season right now.  Of the three that could be a partner to Emo (Duck/Username/Zeus), the partner IS Duck.  I do not suspect that it is Duck, I know it is Duck.  There are a few points that may or may not seem important to you, but are quite important if taken together.<br>\n<br>\n1. <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5527546#p5527546\" class=\"postlink\">Scumslipping</a>.

A lot.  And here we have these two right on the forefront of them, encouraging us to split votes on townies.<br>\n<br>\n3. Given that Emo hard bussed the fuck out of PV, I strongly doubt her other buddy was left out to dry for town cred.  Its not me.  Its not jake.  Its not hopkirk.  <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5544546#p5544546\" class=\"postlink\">This post</a> is a bus.  He comes up with some arbitrary pool and hedges his way onto PV through....\"I dont wanna lynch Zeus, wah wah\", \"Slandaar's PR will be confirmable\", and \"AP might be scum but Im not going to touch him with a 11.5 foot pole\".  This post way too haphazardly winds up on PV for no real reason and shortly after emo goes into high gear and starts that wagon up as if PV did something worthy of being voted suddenly.  He didn't, and she didn't have a track guilty on him.  There is no scumhunting from Duck here.  Just some dumb PoE that happens to land on PV right before he gets hard driven into the ground?

Username never said why he replaced out and it really could have been for any number of reasons.

I am perfectly willing to put the previous game we were both in behind us, but of course, you plan to be an utter idiot and not do so. So thanks for that, real nice of you. You are twisting my words - I posted exactly what I was thinking, so shut up and stop completely transforming what I said to make it look dumb. Because that's just annoying. And just because it differs from your ever so important opinion doesn't mean it's a huge pack of lies. Get it?<br>\nBullying people in a game isn't smart, okay? Not at all. If you plan to insult me then let's make them 100% constructive, yeah?<br>\nAnd, of course, I understood that some people may go 'oh, what an OMGUS' when I voted for you. But you are just milking the damn situation, and it's both annoying and stupid. I voted for YOU because I scumread YOU because of what YOU did in THIS GAME. So don't pull all that 'why me?' crap.<br>\nAnd I am NOT saying nothing. I'm contributing or at least attenpting to, because it's pretty hard when one knows that they're going to be bullied by someone like you in about two in every five posts. And I READ YOUR FUDGING ISO, stfu.<br>\nAnd requesting a policy lynch is just BLOODY IDIOTIC. Getting somebody you dislike and want to lynch due to I don't even know is STUPID. I repeat, STUPID. You want to go get us into MyLo/LyLo, just because of somebody you want to fully express your dislike of from the start, whether it's because of my vote on you or something else. I am, of course, pretty happy to just treat you as I treat anyone else in this game. But you know what? That feeling has completely diminished. You want to express hatred? I'll do so too. Great, what a lovely game. You're sure making this a nice experience for all of us.<br>\nFurthermore, my reasons for seeing you as scum still stand. I will use my vote only for who I see as scum. I see you are too immature for that. I saw your reluctancy to change your vote earlier, and don't pretend that your dumb bias had nothing to do with it.<br>\nOh, and are there any more people you still want to get togather to gang up on me? I'm quite happy to take it all on.<br>\nYou're going and basically calling me useless. And that's both harsh and untrue. While I'm certainly not the best at mafia, and I don't claim to be, useless is just going too damn far. Bully. But I CAN go prove you right, y'know? I may as well go and coast, maybe that way you'll get an opportunity to find a second person to bully too. You'd really like that, hm?<br>\nTo be honest, I'd replace out right now if it wasn't for the fact that I've only just replaced in here.

Slandaar and Jake I'm not sure on. I also have been working on the conspiracy of Jake-Slandaar, and if it's possible. I thought at a point they could both be town; why not both be scum, who just really, REALLY don't get along? And if only one of them is scum, who it'd be. Gut kinda says it'd be Slandaar over Jake, but I've got nothing backing that up.<br>\n<br>\nThis is all pretty dang god-awful as far as analysis goes, though. You're right.

The \"2\" theories hint at either me being town, or me being scum. As soon as you returned from your V/LA, PV continued to post reiterating his vote on me. Jake, you at this point did not have any interaction with PV at all even after you stated that you will \"probably vote him when you catch up\".<br>\n<br>\nSince I did not bus PV, his made an actual effort in having people vote me. Why was there a brief push? PV also quoted all of the interaction between AP and I just to prove to AP that his opinion of Slandaar was influenced by me.

I wonder if his enthusiasm was due to that being true.<br>\n<br>\nAlthough PV did not talk to Slandaar directly, he did mention him in his case by accusing me of setting up town after town.

I'm very unsure about who the remaining scummers are, and pushed the lynch away from me to a towny. Likely I'm going to get lynched for that and we lose the game. But on the other hand, If Jake and Slandaar is TvT, we have also lost, even if we lynch me today, as I assume they are not going to suddenly do something else then voting the other one.<br>\nWe'll go to no lynch or a mislynch then, next day they vote eachother again and we lose. In that regard lynching into them might be better.<br>\nBut at the very least, we should wait with lynching until Hermy and Mastin are caught up and have had the time to give their thoughts on the game.<br>\nAlso, it would be nice if Yiley joined the conversation a bit more, as he's confirmed town he should be able to put things in good perspective.<br>\n<br>\nAs for my current reads on everyone:<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Yiley</div>: Mason<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Emo</div>: I don't see any reason for her to bus PV at the point that she began to push him.

So she's absolutely town.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">AP</div>: His case on me is weak. It seems like he is scumreading me only because of associations between unflipped players. Also, he really wants to lynch me, but doesn't vote for me at the moment. His current play feels a bit like he's flinging shit around just to see what sticks. But on the other hand, I don't think scum would defend Hermy in such an unrefined manner. I also liked his posting when he just replaced in. He's likely town.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Hermy</div> Had an bad entrance post and a fight with emo, not much else. I don't think her reaction to Emo was justified (reading half an ISO of one player in a 2000+ posts game and calling it passable is kind of weak). But then again, It is possible that their previous interaction was so bad that this was just the proverbial straw on the camel's back. All in all I think she is somewhat likely to be scum.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Mastin2</div> I don't know yet.

I think he's also likely town<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Slandaar</div> I want him to be town, because getting mad and asking someone to replace out because they (think they) have a solid case against you is so incredibly low that I don't want that to have happend. But on the other hand, he completely ignored the push on PV and tried to shift attention to AP and Emo.  I also don't like how all his cases are based on someone telling a blatant lie. Why would scum be telling lies that are easily verifiable? <br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Jake</div> First day he mostly argued over mafia theory (hopkirks thoughts on starting a game and scumminess of listposts) and completely ignored the push on grey (but he did make some offhand remarks that Grey was town) But on the other hand he is constantly trying to get people who want to lynch a lurker to consider PV as at least an equally good candidate. I don't see why he would do that as scum. <br>\n<br>\nI left out the claiming of PR's out on purpose, as setup speculations just confuse me and I don't have enough experience to get any benefit from it. The remarks made that I was biased towards Slandaar were based on him claiming a PR<br>\n<br>\nI strongly suggest that we lynch between Jake, Slandaar and me. I am really hesitant to vote for either one of them, because I'm getting lynched no matter what tomorrow I think. Either I have bussed my partner, or lynched a towny. So this is actually some sort of MYLO to me.<br>\nAsk yourself the following question: Am I confident in my abilty to find the two remaining scum, and getting them lynched back to back? If you answer yes to this, vote me.<br>\nIf the answer is no, I think it's best to vote Slandaar, I chose him over Jake because this should also solve the \"there can't be so much PR's\" debate.<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: Hermy</span><br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Slandaar</span>", "time": "Tue Jan 14, 2014 12:19 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=34150&start=2525", "forum": "53", "thread": "34150"}

I need to address you first because I'm sure you will find that your track attempt on {Me/Jake/Emo} turned up negative last night and you are frustrated and wanting to vote me.  Firstly, I know you to be town because your complete ambivalence toward the PV wagon could only come from someone who genuinely did not know PV was scum.  If you are scum, then I applaud your ability to not look it.  Presuming Emogirl is town and you scum, it would be suicide to ignore the PV wagon like that, especially sense you know she is gunning for you on the next day.  I suppose you/Emo could be a team, but I find it unlikely that Emo would thro-away such a strong lead by bussing BOTH buddies.  <div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">I conclude that you are likely town aligned and will operate under that assumption for now.</div><br>\n<br>\nNow lets talk about why the scumteam risked you getting a track guilty in favor of killing a mason.  You getting a track guilty is a pretty big ordeal.  Even if you get lynched today with one, that still means a scum is lynched on D4 and the game goes to 4p mylo.  That is a fairly favorable position for town considering that we started D2 off in a world of hurt.  I state with 100% certainty that you will have tracked within {Jake/Emo/AP} and gotten a negative result.  <div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">It is completely ridiculous to assume that both remaining scum will be found in that group</div>.  For that to be true, both scum bussed PV and then put themselves at risk for being track-guiltied by you.  It is 100% silly to suggest that the scumteam took a strong D2 lead and risked throwing that to a 4p mylo situation that could be anyone's game.  I know I am town, but I also know that Emo/Jake are not a scumteam.  I hope you can reach the conclusion that I did here.  <div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">One of Zeus/Username/Duck must be scum.</div>  They made the kill last night which was known to be safe from your eyes.

The trick is in figuring out if he's being set up for the mislynch or if he's scum setting up mislynches.<br>\n<br>\nThis is why I intend to tackle the whole game (well, relevant bits of it), but right now, that'd be a bad idea. I've got biases right now, and if I read with those biases in mind, my evidence would be tainted by my reads; I need to go in with a clear mind, so give me a bit to muster that mindset. It's one far more analytical than I'm used to using. <br>\n<br>\nRight now, this game's basically near the top of my priority list. I'm reading along (sorta), and I've got ideas (kinda), but I'm not really invested as I should be, because I haven't done the work necessary to get that grip thusfar. I can't give an exact date on when I'll do the catch-up. Could have been today, could be tomorrow, could be later; the best answer I've got is \"soonish\". So continue your talking--it's not worthless; I AM listening.

Approximately half an hour was given to analyze your <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5483279#p5483279\" class=\"postlink\">post</a>, and I came to the conclusion that whatever I thought earlier about you was negligible. I wanted to see if your response was either to say you were pressuring him for information, or if you genuinely thought the vote had a good basis during the time of RVS.

This isn't a defense at all, really. It's an attempt to deflect onto something that Slandaar was right about: regardless of his alignment, his statement about thinking that's what JKLM did would be true, thus, it was not an intentional lie. But Jake used it as basically, \"Ha, you think I'm lying? Well, you're lying, too!\" When the \"lie\" between the two is entirely different. Jake's lie is in contradictory stances with no flow to them. They're all internal, relating to his own posts. Slandaar's 'lie' is in what he said not lining up to the facts of the thread--something easily attributed to simply misremembering things, and when the issue was brought up, Slandaar owned up and said, \"yes\".

Because, bluntly, I came into this game expecting to die. When that didn't happen, I knew I'd have to do something. I was at the time in depression, though, so that messed me up, and for the life of me, I couldn't get a good read. On anyone. I still don't know who is scum despite being dead. It could be you, it could be pecan, it could be AP, hell, it could even be Nacho. Fuck, for all I know, it's emo. I simply could not get a good read. And it's right there in my posting. I tried keeping up with the game. But I was having trouble getting a grip. I tried figuring things out, yet no matter what, I continued coming up empty. Nothing. Everything was faked, yes. Because I have literally nothing. On anyone. Not through lack of effort. When I remembered about this game, you have my word that I was thinking. And thinking. Literally every damn minute I had.

At my role PM, no. At myself. <br>\n<br>\nI'll take 90% of the blame for the loss, right here, right now. Because there is all sorts of things that I should have done but didn't. I shouldn't have accepted. I should have read during the night, chance of being nightkilled be damned. I should have offered to replace out when I realized I was having trouble getting reads. I should have kept caught up, instead of giving up on keeping up and going along. I should have given every single spare moment of my time, even if that only meant progressing my readthrough one post at a time, rather than insisting on setting aside a batch of time to do so. I should have followed through on what little feelings I did have in the game, in spite of how weak they were. I should have, but didn't. That's all on me.<br>\n<br>\nBut you cannot with a straight face claim that there was not town in me. Not much. Oh, that's another bit; I should have had far more of a strong presence in the game so that the towniness would be more evident. But no matter how subtle, the signs were there. And if you were town, you missed them. Entirely and completely. You of all people know what I've been through. And while I've overcome the depression, that doesn't mean there haven't been lingering effects. Fallout from the bomb. In this case, being an utter lack of ability to comprehensively maintain consistency this game.<br>\n<br>\nAs I said. I can see any of you. Literally any of you. As being scum. Despite knowing full good and well only two are. I'm thinking pecan's one. But that's weak-as-hell. Like I said. I have nothing. I had nothing. I said as much.

But I also knew that if I focused on the names on it, it would taint my reads. I'm egotistical. Of <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">course</div> I'd think those voting me would be scum. Completely and entirely ruining my chances of providing actual content.

I <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">have</div> been posting things, and not just regurgitation of others' previous posting. My walls had analysis in them. They were me trying to figure things out. And I was setting aside literally the entirety of my day for this game. I was going to come in. (I came home early from work today, even.) Skip lunch, maybe even skip supper, maybe even skip the god-damned super-bowl despite the Seahawks being in it, for MS.net games, and resist the urge to get distracted by art or video games. Prod-dodge post in other games. And focus the entirety of my effort in reading the remaining 95 or so pages in the game. One damn day is all I needed.<br>\n<br>\nYes, I squandered previous opportunities. As I said...fallout from the depression. I needed to work out a schedule. There are things that I needed to get done. I tried my best to manage my time, so that I could have the opportunity to do so. But this is not a skill I inherently possess. I did what I could to prioritize things effectively and maximize my time, but obstacles and shortcomings that I hadn't accounted for kept interfering, and my mindset of \"all or nothing\" got in the way. Thus the blame. I should have replaced out because of the time management issue. I should have better organized so that I would have a failsafe. I should have adapted a \"do what I can when I can\" mentality instead of the doomed-to-fail 'all-or-nothing' one. All on me. But no. I did not give no effort. I did not not-try. I should have given more time/effort. Yet they were already there, having done nothing. I should have conveyed this better, that yes. I was having trouble getting a grip. That yes. I was lost. That, yes. I had no clue what I was doing. That, yes. I had no real opinions. That, yes, I wasn't keeping up. That part's also on me. <br>\n<br>\nAnd, yes, I was going in entirely unbiased. I cleared my head of an AP-Jake scumteam. I cleared my head of you being town. I cleared my head of everything, to try and get solidified grounding, rather than the nothingness I had before, which still had biases based off of nothing but emotional quick-reactions rather than actual solid basing. <br>\n<br>\nBut these things being present? Huge fucking tip-off. It's my fault for not emphasizing them enough. (I believe I didn't out of fear that they'd be used to scumread me.) Yet of all the players in the game?<br>\nOnly emo?<br>\nThe player who knows me the least?<br>\n<br>\nManaged to actually pick up on that? That's where you can find the other 10%. Nacho's said it best about me. I cannot be defined by some arbitrary traits, such as willpower or heart. I cannot be defined by some arbitrary requirement like content or activity. Those things peak into Mastin as a person. Never the player. Never the alignment. Emo was the only one who seemed to pick up on these things.
