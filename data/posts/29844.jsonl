All <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=14372\" class=\"postlink\">sitewide rules/guidelines</a> apply.<br>2. I'm using this colour, try not to use it or I'll assume you're impersonating me.<br>3. Communication about this game is not allowed outside of this thread, excepting in Mod-supplied locations.<br>4. Don't quote things about this game that come from outside of the thread. You may paraphrase. Use good judgement.<br>5. Breadcrumbing and other forms of in-thread communication are fine. Don't do anything weird and encrypted though.<br>6. Prods will be issued after 72 hours, or 48 on request (requested prods for a time period less than 72 hours will not be counted as \"official\" prods). If you don't post for 24 hours after a prod, you will be replaced.<br>7. Players with three \"official\" prods will be replaced.<br>8. Players on V/LA will not be prodded until 48 hours after their V/LA ends.<br>9. Days 1 and 2 will be three weeks long. Subsequent days will last two weeks. Nights 1 and 2 will be three days in duration. Subsequent nights will last two days. The scum may elect to shorten the night by 24 hours, provided all night actions have been submitted. Daystart PMs will be provided.<br>10. Votes must be bolded/votetagged.<br>11. Lynches require simple majority (50% + 1). No lynch will occur if this is not reached by deadline. You may also vote no-lynch. No-lynch will also require simple majority.<br>12. Once a lynch has been reached, all living players and the lynched player may continue talking until the flip is posted.<br>13. If actions are not submitted by deadline they are forfeit.<br>14. Flavour is not relevant. At all. It's the same tinytown stuff that has been run in the Normal sections <span style=\"font-style: italic\">forever</span>.<br>15. Rules will be modified if necessary.

I think you're scum' would have the main accusation being that Gen is scum. Robb on the other hand wanted to defend Gen, but was only willing to go as far defending her from the not really-there accusation of idiocy. That's the actions of someone who doesn't want their partner lynched, but at the same time doesn't want to be too close to their partner."}

You voted someone who happened to be scum, but you also voted someone who happened to be town. <br>3. yes now you use the word WE. previously you said that YOU (note the bolded in your quote) hung scum. <br><br>it's a false representation because you did not single handedly lead town on either of those lynches (especially the 2nd game where you only posted 5 times and lurked the remainder of the day phase) Just because you got lucky and happened to find yourself on a scum lynch, doesn't mean your scum hunting ability is superior. Also you inflated your ability by bringing in claims of your success from another site because it proves nothing.<br><br>I used to play on another site and I was average, after playing here for a few games I went back and was immediately NK'd every night 1 and post game turns out i had damn near caught almost every single person on the scum team, I even caught the cult leader which is damn hard to do. That doesn't mean that my success there would translate here because it's the quality of play.<br><br>you DID inflate your ability, you DID claim to be responsible for 2 scum lynches both of these statements are a blatant attempt to deceive people in my opinion."}

There was no need to ask the question.<br><br>I do care if I can't get them lynched. I can't understand for the life of me how the other town in this game is being so accepting of his behaviour. The problem isn't with me, the problem is with everyone else who is town who thinks his actions are pro-town.<br><br>How am I being vague? If anything I am being painfully obvious about my reasonings. I also am able to convey my thoughts quite well, if you don't think so then I would have to reiterate the first point in post 352 about you not reading too well. <br><br>I am not being intentionally anything, except intentionally being myself.  Anyone who thinks lying and lurking are acceptable deserves to be insulted imo.<br><br><br>Here is why town should not lurk - They aren't active enough to read, they aren't active enough to provide reads, they aren't active enough to ask questions and scumhunt, their votes are almost never listened to or they end up blindly sheeping (both of which are bad especially when it gets to lylo because scum will just leave them alive and hope to have them mis-lynched at some point, especially if they make it to lylo)<br><br>rofl hasn't even answered a direct questioned that someone (can't even remember who at this point) asked them and if he had read like he claimed he had, he would have saw the question directed at him and answered it. But he will probably claim he didn't see the question and everyone will be ok with that. <br><br>It's bullshit. He is taking advantage of the extremely long (72 hours) activity requirements to skate by. None of this is pro-town, even in the off chance he is actually town, it's still not pro-town behaviour. <br><br>Lying and Lurking are probably the worst things that have been done this game, if I ignored those nobody else has really done anything overtly scummy besides maybe Empking. But I can't ignore lying and I certainly won't ignore lurking either. <br><br><br>But, you realize you aren't really doing a good job at trying to get me lynched? i don't see you cheerleading people trying to get them to vote me. I still have not seen anyone make a case against me like I asked. If anything YOU are being vague and are failing to convey your thoughts, because tbh I have no clue why you are even voting me, except for the fact that you hate my playstyle. That's a great reason to lynch someone, much better than lurking or lying (ACTUAL scumtells) right?  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif\" alt=\":roll:\" title=\"Rolling Eyes\">"}

Now, we've got multiple people feeling the SAME EXACT WAY, but that's not scummy at all.  Somebody school me on the proper way to point this out in the future?  I saw a couple people post \"Policy Lynch.\"  Is that a disclaimer for a gameplay related lynch?  Because I called his play toxic to town, which I thought was appropriate.<br><br>In the end its too bad, because like I said... I think Robb is town, he's had a couple good posts with content/insights/info (look at the work he put into meta research of different players, or his post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5118536#p5118536\">283</a>, which I was hoping to get back around to and dialogue on), and about 100 other posts that only piss people off and alienate them from the game.  Either way, Robb is toxic to town, and I think at this point he needs to go.  We're going to end up with half the game replacing out or not posting as a result.  From a tactical standpoint, is it more appropriate to call for a replacement, or ask for a modkill instead of lynching Robb?<br><br>Next point I want to address:<br>This notion/concept/whatever on this board that \"If you are town, you will answer all questions right away, immediately.\"  I have found this to be false and/or a bad strategy to grasp onto so tightly.  As a general rule of thumb, yes...  share info with everybody.  But I pointed to a couple general scenarios to support my position, and I'll try to elaborate a bit with a specific example from this game (for anybody who cares.)  \"Spoilered\" so it doesn't clutter up the page:<br><br><div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: </b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display: none;\">Earlier in game, I asked Gen-Wolf for his read on a player.<br>Mr E Roll questioned me as to why I asked specifically for Gen-Wolf's opinion.<br>I asked for latitude in answering it...  Not because I didn't want to answer the question, but because the TIMING of it was poor from my perspective.  Why poor timing?<br><br>At said time, I had a strong town read on Gen-Wolf that I didn't want to reveal as the reason for choosing him for an opinion.  Often times, I ask my town reads for their opinions on people that I'm suspicious of.  It helps develop content for the thread, as well as association patterns for later analysis, it gives me another opinion (that I value) to cross check my opinion against, and it can instigate comfortable conversation.  You'll notice I did the same thing with Robb, asking him about RedCoyote  So a very simple \"softball question\" can effectively do 2-4 things at once and not tip my hand.  I like to play with my cards close to my chest and very often will obscure or hide my motivations/goals in the short term.  I'm always happy to reveal them later and explain thoroughly, once the play has been made or the opportunity expired.<br><br>Why didn't I want to reveal my town read on Gen-Wolf?  I don't think that D1 midday it's a good strategy for every townie to be revealing who their strongest town reads are as it only helps mafia.  They know who is town, but they need to choose between trying to kill PR's or killing the more \"townie\" players, or hoping they are one in the same.  Sharing certain things are great for the town, sharing everything isn't...<br><br>The mafia has an information advantage, inherent to the game, but strategic town play can limit the additional information they glean from day phases.  There's situation variations on this, IE, player is facing a lynch (share all your thoughts before you go), you're a overwhelmingly \"town\" read player (you might get popped overnight), etc.  But for my current situation in this game and time, I thought it a bad play.  I'm town, but I'm drawing suspicion and heat.  I can guess that the mafia will likely leave me alone overnight as a potential mislynch (since public sentiment is going that way.)  My analysis says that chances are I can save the reveal of my town reads and sweeping opinions until a later point in the game, when it is more beneficial to town (it may be later this day phase if everybody decides to lynch me instead of Robb, for this crazy wall o text.)<br><br>More reasons:  At said time, I hadn't spent much time focusing on Mr E Roll, but I knew he had done some digging into Gen-Wolf.  I hadn't formulated a read.  If my read on Mr E Roll says \"maybe scum\", and my read on Gen-Wolf says \"maybe town\", I may adjust how I answer the question of why I chose Gen-Wolf specifically.  I don't like giving mafia the info they are \"LOOKING FOR\"... so maybe I do an evil thing that everybody on this board says townies should never do and \"LIE\" when I respond to Mr E Roll about why I specifically asked Gen-Wolf.  Maybe instead of saying \"I think he's town, and I wanted his opinion\" which is the truth, I say \"Gen-Wolf hadn't engaged anybody on my short list, and I thought it helpful to develop content\" which is a BLATANT LIE about my motivation/reasoning, but true enough that nobody would care.<br><br>P.S. Not only do I think it's okay for townies to not answer questions some times, I also thinks it's okay for them to tell certain lies (see above.)  Nobody tell Robb I said that.<br><br>In reality, sometimes it's like writing a novel to explain why I choose to do/don't do something sometimes.  I don't always have the time to type up a book of Bauss's strange take on mafia strategies.  It was easier to just say \"Latitude please\" or \"Can I circle back around to this later?\"  I know it's different, and if I have to conform to the standards here in order to be a long term player/contributor, I'll take that into consideration.  In the interim, I'm okay with having scum points as I'm not a player that craves being confirmed town.  As a player, I LIKE to play in the gray zone that keeps me fighting.</div></div></div><br><br>I don't want to fill up this game thread with a sweeping strategy discussion... so my apologies.  If there is a more appropriate place to have a strategy discussion on this board, I'll gladly take it there after this game concludes."}

Coyote votes Robb on Page 3, and now the wagon takes on that shitty stink of a scum-driven vehicle. At this point, I don't see Robb's push on Gen as scummy. I see it as coming for a bad reason, sure, but it seems he's scumhunting. Target comes along with another vote on Robb.

He's right that a single throwaway from a year old meta isn't valid, and he's right that Robb wasn't chainsawing. I don't like Robb calling out Salmonella for not having a non-RVS vote down--- some people will move their vote when they're damn good and ready, and not until. Post #82 is boring, I ain't reading that shit. Asking permission to put someone at L-1 is not scummy, it's just something that pussies do. Year old meta is still not valid scumhunting, Robb.

Robb is hunting for contentless posters, which I've always found to be a nulltell.

Of course a player defends himself when attacked. Seriously when Empking argues with people all I hear in my brain is static. I tune it out, lest I become filled with murderous rage. Robb \"proves\" he was lurking which is abjectly wrong. Well, the proof is, anyway. Page 6 is even worse than the last page and makes me want to kill myself and everyone around me. Bauss scummy as shit for whining about all the posts while not contributing anything of substance. Some people post alot, I feel sorry for you if you ever wind up in a game with someone like me or DGB. OH WAIT. I disagree with Robb that 2 days into the game a player having less posts than the mod is significant. Especially when votes have moved around alot and there are a bunch of pages. Some mods are really good about vote counts. Bauss wants to vote robb just to shut him up.<br><br>Bauss is displaying classic behavior of \"I THINK YOU'RE TOWN BUT I WILL LYNCH YOU FOR THE GOOD OF THE TOWN.\" I haven't decided if it's scummy in this case. It's not necessarily a scumtell because I have (and will) lynch a town read just to rid the town of them. But depending on the situation, it can be.<br><br>Page 7, Confidanon moves his vote over to rofl. I find this significant in the face of the other wagons but I'm not sure how. Robb has a valid point in 152. I too hate it when people post only to whine about people posting. Shut the fuck up and post something for people to talk about if the current discussion annoys you. Robb still lurker hunting, which is pretty annoying in a game 48 hours old where he has half the posts. That's not lurking. Play with kdowns, then complain about lurking. At this point the Robb wagon starts to fizzle, not liking Desperado turning to bauss. Not liking bauss' seemingly random read of Coyote as scum. Lots of players play excellent scum games. I agree with bauss that sometimes a town player needs to die for the good of the town. Bauss tries to get the town to move on past Robb, which I see as a good thing.  Hating Coyote's move to Gen.<br><br>Page 8, people stop whining about the content of posts. Provide content, not bitching. Where the fuck is rofl in all of this? I'm not seeing bauss as scum, there are scummier players. The 7for7 thing is interesting, just not scummy.  Way too much meta crap on page 8.<br><br>Page 9, robb is just all over the place by this point and it's clear that this town is driving him to a nervous breakdown. Target1 may be scum white-knighting Robb. (\"Oh, he's scummy but he's probably trying to catch scum!\" No.)  More of the \"BUT HE ACCUSED HIM OF LYING\" horse beating, i'm just skipping all this crap. <br><br>Page 10, robb still using \"he lied\" as a major scumtell. Robb, it's not enough to show someone how they lied. You have to show a clear scum motivation. And how this differs from just being mistaken. rofl makes real life excuses, eh, not enough for me to brand him the Candyman yet. Still don't like Robb's lurker hunt. I see Target as scummier and scummier with each post. Confid picks up on this and votes him. Too early for a bus, maybe? I don't see this vote derailing any of the current wagons. E Roll makes a point in this page about healthy posting, but for some reason my brain isn't reading it as sentences just as words. Coyote is mollified by rofl's excuse. <br><br>After Page 10, Robb is still very very wordy and boring town, Salmonella still town. Not sure about rofl at the moment, I want to see more from him. Desperado disappears off the map for a few pages. Bauss is looking fairly town. I want to see more out of Confid. Target is scummy as hell.<br><br>I joined this game and skimmed the page in which I replaced and I assumed that Robb and I would be forced to kill one another in a house of mirrors but it doesn't look like that's the case. For all the bitching and complaining about his posting or tone, I just don't see how he's a cancer on the game. Sure, he posts alot, but he's not exactly mean about any of it. Tunnelly MAYBE but that's just how some players play. It's not like he's simply telling people to \"shut up you cunt\" etc etc."}

Robb has an incredibly abrasive playstyle. Almost every post reads like he's looking for some kind of confrontation. The incident with roflcopter felt like a schoolyard bully who pokes and prods at another student until they lash out, and then runs and tells the teacher, causing that second student to receive punishment while the real aggressor in the situation walks away scot-free. That kind of behavior doesn't make the game fun for anyone, even though it's technically legal.

I can't speak for everyone, but to reiterate. <br><br>You aren't accepting that there is an issue. You aren't asking whats wrong so that you can try to improve, you are asking whats wrong so that you can try to refute it. I Know this because you've tried to refute every issue someone has brought up. Whether they have issue vocalizing their own grievances or not, they still tried, and the issue is real demonstrated by the number of people with it. <br><br>You're a dick when dealing with people. And not a minor one, or in a way that is all playful. You read something from someone, and make no effort to understand it, you assume its whatever flawed piece of shit went through your mind on the first pass. You don't assume that the other person is likely competent and take the effort to figure out what they actually meant. It doesn't surprise me that you think the thread is a what, 30 minute read now? given that.<br><br>The fact that you are delusional doesn't help anything, but its not the root cause of the issue. The root cause is your arrogance. Stop using your messed up ideology/scum hunting method/whatever you want to call it as a scape goat."}

So many townspeople were moving out and moving in that it started to become hard to tell the normal, innocent family men from the terrors of the night, the sane from the insane, the good from the bad, or the truth from the lies - but that didn't stop anyone from trying. People began to battle with bouts of paranoia, and a Cold War-era program was quickly set up.

My patient for the past two nights as been kuribo, who I am pretty damn sure has a gun in his pocket. <br><br>In fact, I almost blocked his shot on Robb the first night, but I made an honest judgment call that the town would be better off without Robb. So I paid a house call to DGB instead. Every other day I have been keeping kuribo protected as he has been one of my biggest townreads and my pick as a Vig.<br><br>I really don't think notscience is scum. The Zaicon lynch is my biggest tool with which to analyze this. notscience was voting himself and generally just playing rather fecklessly this game. I'd like to think notscience might try to take credit for being on the Zaicon wagon. Additionally, Emp's take on the CA/Zaicon wagon was really tight-lipped. Admittedly, I fought very hard against it, but at least I had a solid position. Emp really didn't talk about CA/Zaicon much at all. He joined the wagon on the back of CoK's statement when it looked like it was gaining serious, inevitable momentum. It was like he held off from using his vote seriously that whole day until he thought he couldn't reasonably get a mislynch off any longer. Now it's obvious why he didn't want to join the SD lynch. rofl was spearheading it and he didn't want to be implicated with him. Lastly, as tunneled as notscience was on SD this game, when SD was actually feeling the heat after my putting him at L-1 yesterday, notscience jumped off the wagon. That really looked town and actually kind of surprised me as well."}
