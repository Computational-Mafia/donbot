Several of the Townspeople are traitors(!) working to kill the rest so that the teeny tiny town can be used as a trade stop in the drug trade. Does the stress drive anyone crazy?

I'm using this colour, try not to use it or I'll assume you're impersonating me.<br>\n3. Communication about this game is not allowed outside of this thread, excepting in Mod-supplied locations.<br>\n4. Don't quote things about this game that come from outside of the thread. You may paraphrase. Use good judgement.<br>\n5. Breadcrumbing and other forms of in-thread communication are fine. Don't do anything weird and encrypted though.<br>\n6. Prods will be issued after 72 hours, or 48 on request (requested prods for a time period less than 72 hours will not be counted as \"official\" prods). If you don't post for 24 hours after a prod, you will be replaced.<br>\n7. Players with three \"official\" prods will be replaced.<br>\n8. Players on V/LA will not be prodded until 48 hours after their V/LA ends.<br>\n9. Days 1 and 2 will be three weeks long. Subsequent days will last two weeks. Nights 1 and 2 will be three days in duration. Subsequent nights will last two days. The scum may elect to shorten the night by 24 hours, provided all night actions have been submitted. Daystart PMs will be provided.<br>\n10. Votes must be bolded/votetagged.<br>\n11. Lynches require simple majority (50% + 1). No lynch will occur if this is not reached by deadline. You may also vote no-lynch. No-lynch will also require simple majority.<br>\n12. Once a lynch has been reached, all living players and the lynched player may continue talking until the flip is posted.<br>\n13. If actions are not submitted by deadline they are forfeit.<br>\n14.

I wasn't in the business of whacking down a second vote on another player with only 4 others having posted so I mentioned the loop and voted someone else. (Although I see Mr E Roll immediately disagreed with that by doubling up on my own vote.) <br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>RedCoyote wrote:</cite>\n<blockquote><div><cite>talah 15 wrote:</cite>Also please don't phrase a statement as a question - eg \"Target just voted?\"</div></blockquote>\n\nAnother odd comment.

Interestingly enough they are both on your short list: Salmonella Dreams and Red Coyote. They were both scum.<br>\n<br>\nI have a slight town read on Coyote right now. <br>\n<br>\nI have a null read on Salmonella. His play seems a little more tentative this game than the last. I think that is probably because he doesn&#8217;t need to try as hard to look town because he is town. But I&#8217;m a little worried it might be because a big part of my case against him was due to day one interactions so he may be avoiding those now.<br>\n<br>\nAs far as your short list I think it is interesting that two of the three people on your list were voting for rofl. I also think it is interesting that you have a short list already since there has been so little content from some many people it seems premature to have short list.<br>\n<br>\nI&#8217;m also bothered by your question wanting to know who the best players are.

But all we have is assumptions and maybes most of the time. I agree that narrowing down the status quo behavior original list might remove a scum.

Garbage in garbage out? Or is there a different usage on this board?<br>\n<br>\nThere's no pretense of being solely technical. I laid out a fairly simple analysis, explained the assumptions clearly along with my reasoning, and shared. If you don't like 1/3 of it, swap that out with some insights of your own and share or work it. Don't knock my shit just to knock it. Or if 2/3 of it are good, and make sense to you, drop out the other third. Even if you take out my content based read list, it's still a workable pool with just the behaviors. That stuff takes time to lay out, pull together and get right. Don't discredit/invalidate it because you think my content reads are garbage.<br>\n<br>\nTechnical analysis is just one piece of the puzzle. Mafia isn't one dimensional, so I don't limit my reads to a single method. I'm sure you analyze voting patterns and history mid-late game to support reads or evaluate players. That's technical. Does it mean you can't also use a gut read as you look over that data? One of those,\"something doesn't/does feel right\" type of reads?

If you're trying to use this as a point against me (I think you are just using it to push at Robb, but I am not 100% sure), my response is that players can have multiple scumreads at once.

You're essentially creating three random lists and cross referencing them. Okay, fair enough. I'll grant you that the first list and third list is acceptable criteria with which to narrow down scum (activity and Robb wagon respectively).<br>\n<br>\nBut the lists are in no way are related to one another. The second list is simply your scumreads and has no objective data whatsoever. So to combine them all together for the purposes of narrowing down suspects is not particularly scientific.

No. My vote was obvious and had you been reading you would have known why I voted him. There was no need to ask the question.<br>\n<br>\nI do care if I can't get them lynched. I can't understand for the life of me how the other town in this game is being so accepting of his behaviour. The problem isn't with me, the problem is with everyone else who is town who thinks his actions are pro-town.<br>\n<br>\nHow am I being vague? If anything I am being painfully obvious about my reasonings. I also am able to convey my thoughts quite well, if you don't think so then I would have to reiterate the first point in post 352 about you not reading too well. <br>\n<br>\nI am not being intentionally anything, except intentionally being myself.  Anyone who thinks lying and lurking are acceptable deserves to be insulted imo.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nHere is why town should not lurk - They aren't active enough to read, they aren't active enough to provide reads, they aren't active enough to ask questions and scumhunt, their votes are almost never listened to or they end up blindly sheeping (both of which are bad especially when it gets to lylo because scum will just leave them alive and hope to have them mis-lynched at some point, especially if they make it to lylo)<br>\n<br>\nrofl hasn't even answered a direct questioned that someone (can't even remember who at this point) asked them and if he had read like he claimed he had, he would have saw the question directed at him and answered it. But he will probably claim he didn't see the question and everyone will be ok with that. <br>\n<br>\nIt's bullshit. He is taking advantage of the extremely long (72 hours) activity requirements to skate by. None of this is pro-town, even in the off chance he is actually town, it's still not pro-town behaviour. <br>\n<br>\nLying and Lurking are probably the worst things that have been done this game, if I ignored those nobody else has really done anything overtly scummy besides maybe Empking. But I can't ignore lying and I certainly won't ignore lurking either. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\nBut, you realize you aren't really doing a good job at trying to get me lynched? i don't see you cheerleading people trying to get them to vote me. I still have not seen anyone make a case against me like I asked. If anything YOU are being vague and are failing to convey your thoughts, because tbh I have no clue why you are even voting me, except for the fact that you hate my playstyle. That's a great reason to lynch someone, much better than lurking or lying (ACTUAL scumtells) right?  <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":roll:\" title=\"Rolling Eyes\">", "time": "Mon Jul 15, 2013 1:20 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=29844&start=350", "forum": "53", "thread": "29844"}

Robb has an incredibly abrasive playstyle. Almost every post reads like he's looking for some kind of confrontation. The incident with roflcopter felt like a schoolyard bully who pokes and prods at another student until they lash out, and then runs and tells the teacher, causing that second student to receive punishment while the real aggressor in the situation walks away scot-free. That kind of behavior doesn't make the game fun for anyone, even though it's technically legal.

Now, we've got multiple people feeling the SAME EXACT WAY, but that's not scummy at all.  Somebody school me on the proper way to point this out in the future?  I saw a couple people post \"Policy Lynch.\"  Is that a disclaimer for a gameplay related lynch?

I think Robb is town, he's had a couple good posts with content/insights/info (look at the work he put into meta research of different players, or his post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5118536#p5118536\">283</a>, which I was hoping to get back around to and dialogue on), and about 100 other posts that only piss people off and alienate them from the game.  Either way, Robb is toxic to town, and I think at this point he needs to go.  We're going to end up with half the game replacing out or not posting as a result.

But I pointed to a couple general scenarios to support my position, and I'll try to elaborate a bit with a specific example from this game (for anybody who cares.)  \"Spoilered\" so it doesn't clutter up the page:<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: </b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\">Earlier in game, I asked Gen-Wolf for his read on a player.<br>\nMr E Roll questioned me as to why I asked specifically for Gen-Wolf's opinion.<br>\nI asked for latitude in answering it...  Not because I didn't want to answer the question, but because the TIMING of it was poor from my perspective.  Why poor timing?<br>\n<br>\nAt said time, I had a strong town read on Gen-Wolf that I didn't want to reveal as the reason for choosing him for an opinion.  Often times, I ask my town reads for their opinions on people that I'm suspicious of.  It helps develop content for the thread, as well as association patterns for later analysis, it gives me another opinion (that I value) to cross check my opinion against, and it can instigate comfortable conversation.  You'll notice I did the same thing with Robb, asking him about RedCoyote  So a very simple \"softball question\" can effectively do 2-4 things at once and not tip my hand.  I like to play with my cards close to my chest and very often will obscure or hide my motivations/goals in the short term.  I'm always happy to reveal them later and explain thoroughly, once the play has been made or the opportunity expired.<br>\n<br>\nWhy didn't I want to reveal my town read on Gen-Wolf?  I don't think that D1 midday it's a good strategy for every townie to be revealing who their strongest town reads are as it only helps mafia.  They know who is town, but they need to choose between trying to kill PR's or killing the more \"townie\" players, or hoping they are one in the same.  Sharing certain things are great for the town, sharing everything isn't...<br>\n<br>\nThe mafia has an information advantage, inherent to the game, but strategic town play can limit the additional information they glean from day phases.  There's situation variations on this, IE, player is facing a lynch (share all your thoughts before you go), you're a overwhelmingly \"town\" read player (you might get popped overnight), etc.  But for my current situation in this game and time, I thought it a bad play.  I'm town, but I'm drawing suspicion and heat.  I can guess that the mafia will likely leave me alone overnight as a potential mislynch (since public sentiment is going that way.)  My analysis says that chances are I can save the reveal of my town reads and sweeping opinions until a later point in the game, when it is more beneficial to town (it may be later this day phase if everybody decides to lynch me instead of Robb, for this crazy wall o text.)<br>\n<br>\nMore reasons:  At said time, I hadn't spent much time focusing on Mr E Roll, but I knew he had done some digging into Gen-Wolf.  I hadn't formulated a read.  If my read on Mr E Roll says \"maybe scum\", and my read on Gen-Wolf says \"maybe town\", I may adjust how I answer the question of why I chose Gen-Wolf specifically.  I don't like giving mafia the info they are \"LOOKING FOR\"... so maybe I do an evil thing that everybody on this board says townies should never do and \"LIE\" when I respond to Mr E Roll about why I specifically asked Gen-Wolf.  Maybe instead of saying \"I think he's town, and I wanted his opinion\" which is the truth, I say \"Gen-Wolf hadn't engaged anybody on my short list, and I thought it helpful to develop content\" which is a BLATANT LIE about my motivation/reasoning, but true enough that nobody would care.<br>\n<br>\nP.S. Not only do I think it's okay for townies to not answer questions some times, I also thinks it's okay for them to tell certain lies (see above.)  Nobody tell Robb I said that.<br>\n<br>\nIn reality, sometimes it's like writing a novel to explain why I choose to do/don't do something sometimes.  I don't always have the time to type up a book of Bauss's strange take on mafia strategies.  It was easier to just say \"Latitude please\" or \"Can I circle back around to this later?\"  I know it's different, and if I have to conform to the standards here in order to be a long term player/contributor, I'll take that into consideration.  In the interim, I'm okay with having scum points as I'm not a player that craves being confirmed town.  As a player, I LIKE to play in the gray zone that keeps me fighting.</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\nI don't want to fill up this game thread with a sweeping strategy discussion... so my apologies.

Coyote votes Robb on Page 3, and now the wagon takes on that shitty stink of a scum-driven vehicle. At this point, I don't see Robb's push on Gen as scummy. I see it as coming for a bad reason, sure, but it seems he's scumhunting. Target comes along with another vote on Robb.

He's right that a single throwaway from a year old meta isn't valid, and he's right that Robb wasn't chainsawing. I don't like Robb calling out Salmonella for not having a non-RVS vote down--- some people will move their vote when they're damn good and ready, and not until. Post #82 is boring, I ain't reading that shit. Asking permission to put someone at L-1 is not scummy, it's just something that pussies do. Year old meta is still not valid scumhunting, Robb.

Seriously when Empking argues with people all I hear in my brain is static. I tune it out, lest I become filled with murderous rage. Robb \"proves\" he was lurking which is abjectly wrong. Well, the proof is, anyway. Page 6 is even worse than the last page and makes me want to kill myself and everyone around me. Bauss scummy as shit for whining about all the posts while not contributing anything of substance. Some people post alot, I feel sorry for you if you ever wind up in a game with someone like me or DGB. OH WAIT. I disagree with Robb that 2 days into the game a player having less posts than the mod is significant. Especially when votes have moved around alot and there are a bunch of pages. Some mods are really good about vote counts. Bauss wants to vote robb just to shut him up.<br>\n<br>\nBauss is displaying classic behavior of \"I THINK YOU'RE TOWN BUT I WILL LYNCH YOU FOR THE GOOD OF THE TOWN.\" I haven't decided if it's scummy in this case. It's not necessarily a scumtell because I have (and will) lynch a town read just to rid the town of them. But depending on the situation, it can be.<br>\n<br>\nPage 7, Confidanon moves his vote over to rofl. I find this significant in the face of the other wagons but I'm not sure how. Robb has a valid point in 152. I too hate it when people post only to whine about people posting. Shut the fuck up and post something for people to talk about if the current discussion annoys you. Robb still lurker hunting, which is pretty annoying in a game 48 hours old where he has half the posts. That's not lurking. Play with kdowns, then complain about lurking. At this point the Robb wagon starts to fizzle, not liking Desperado turning to bauss. Not liking bauss' seemingly random read of Coyote as scum. Lots of players play excellent scum games. I agree with bauss that sometimes a town player needs to die for the good of the town. Bauss tries to get the town to move on past Robb, which I see as a good thing.  Hating Coyote's move to Gen.<br>\n<br>\nPage 8, people stop whining about the content of posts. Provide content, not bitching. Where the fuck is rofl in all of this? I'm not seeing bauss as scum, there are scummier players. The 7for7 thing is interesting, just not scummy.  Way too much meta crap on page 8.<br>\n<br>\nPage 9, robb is just all over the place by this point and it's clear that this town is driving him to a nervous breakdown. Target1 may be scum white-knighting Robb. (\"Oh, he's scummy but he's probably trying to catch scum!\" No.)  More of the \"BUT HE ACCUSED HIM OF LYING\" horse beating, i'm just skipping all this crap. <br>\n<br>\nPage 10, robb still using \"he lied\" as a major scumtell. Robb, it's not enough to show someone how they lied. You have to show a clear scum motivation. And how this differs from just being mistaken. rofl makes real life excuses, eh, not enough for me to brand him the Candyman yet. Still don't like Robb's lurker hunt. I see Target as scummier and scummier with each post. Confid picks up on this and votes him. Too early for a bus, maybe? I don't see this vote derailing any of the current wagons. E Roll makes a point in this page about healthy posting, but for some reason my brain isn't reading it as sentences just as words. Coyote is mollified by rofl's excuse. <br>\n<br>\nAfter Page 10, Robb is still very very wordy and boring town, Salmonella still town. Not sure about rofl at the moment, I want to see more from him. Desperado disappears off the map for a few pages. Bauss is looking fairly town. I want to see more out of Confid. Target is scummy as hell.<br>\n<br>\nI joined this game and skimmed the page in which I replaced and I assumed that Robb and I would be forced to kill one another in a house of mirrors but it doesn't look like that's the case. For all the bitching and complaining about his posting or tone, I just don't see how he's a cancer on the game. Sure, he posts alot, but he's not exactly mean about any of it. Tunnelly MAYBE but that's just how some players play.

My patient for the past two nights as been kuribo, who I am pretty damn sure has a gun in his pocket. <br>\n<br>\nIn fact, I almost blocked his shot on Robb the first night, but I made an honest judgment call that the town would be better off without Robb.

The Zaicon lynch is my biggest tool with which to analyze this. notscience was voting himself and generally just playing rather fecklessly this game. I'd like to think notscience might try to take credit for being on the Zaicon wagon. Additionally, Emp's take on the CA/Zaicon wagon was really tight-lipped. Admittedly, I fought very hard against it, but at least I had a solid position. Emp really didn't talk about CA/Zaicon much at all. He joined the wagon on the back of CoK's statement when it looked like it was gaining serious, inevitable momentum. It was like he held off from using his vote seriously that whole day until he thought he couldn't reasonably get a mislynch off any longer. Now it's obvious why he didn't want to join the SD lynch. rofl was spearheading it and he didn't want to be implicated with him. Lastly, as tunneled as notscience was on SD this game, when SD was actually feeling the heat after my putting him at L-1 yesterday, notscience jumped off the wagon.
