Are you talking about Squirrel, or have I missed a post somewhere?<br>If it's Squirrel, then I don't agree with the wagon and have no problem going against it. In terms of 'easy target'; I wasn't trying to refer to her as an easy target, but voting someone for sheeping in RVS (as others have said) is an easy explanation that doesn't really require any reasoning aside from posting a wiki link, and doesn't really put yourself out at all.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5450105#p5450105\" class=\"postlink\">post 53</a>, Garmr wrote:</cite>@ Nutsy McSexytail<br>Well I kinda thought i made it clear but if you didn't understand sorry i will try to make it clearer (The faults probably on my end because of my writing skills).<br><br>Sheeping in Rvs stage is fine because it builds wagons but what had me concerned was the fact you declared you might sheep in the future that is a odd thing to say that was my concern not the rvs sheeping itself. <br><br>Also before anyone says but you called Orestes out for sheeping he did it out the Rvs stage, the Rvs stage pretty much ended at post 35 and his vote seemed serious.</div></blockquote><br><br>okay. Just to clear up, I wouldn't call what I was doing 'sheeping'; I realise it may have looked that way from the outside, but I do agree with the Flareon wagon (or I did last night, I'll check again in a moment).<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5450202#p5450202\" class=\"postlink\">post 62</a>, Street Hassle wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5449885#p5449885\" class=\"postlink\">post 45</a>, Orestes wrote:</cite>Can't get a read on Street Hassle yet, if it were later in the day I might have to think more about following him votewise...but it's page 2 and it might be because I haven't played with a hydra before, at least not knowingly.</div></blockquote><br>Why do you feel the need to justify the early game nature of your vote?<br></div></blockquote><br><br>From what I remember this wasn't me trying to justify it, I just wasn't editing my thoughts because it was late and I was drunk.<br>I was trying to say that if I'd solidified more of a scum read on SH, if I still wanted to vote for Flareon on a wagon that I agreed with I'd be a little more careful about it than I was - as I assume anyone would be if one of their scum reads was on a wagon for another of their scum reads.

However, I did still dig the Flareon wagon (will go into more next post), and while I didn't like TvK (re Garmr I was more pushing at him than declaring an actual scum read), he had no votes on him at the time and it's early game; none of my reads were at all strong enough for me to want to push a wagon of my own. I think 10 different wagons during the early game is more detrimental than helpful, so I added myself to a wagon that I liked."}

The entire confirmation-bias paragraph in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5454599#p5454599\">Post 176</a> also is supersupersupertown as is the \"Either I'm having wool over my eyes or this is too easy\" in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5455218#p5455218\">Post 194</a>.

I'll make this short because I really don't want to re-go over their posts a hundred times; Mollies <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5451058#p5451058\">Post 78</a> statement about SG reads super townish given that's similar to how I'm feeling right now and the town reads in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5453141#p5453141\">Post 133</a> mostly match mine. The clinchers though are really the suggestion in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5453545#p5453545\">Post 155</a> coming across as town , \"If we're dead tomorrow go after them to the end of the earth in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5454081#p5454081\">Post 173</a> and them having an identical thought process as me re; Milk in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5455495#p5455495\">Post 208</a> as well as the Fitz-meta pulls. <br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Squirrel</span> is probably the town read I have the most trouble explaining but I have a pretty strong town read on her (It's moreso based on the entirety of her ISO coming across as genuine scumhunting and being transparent rather than specific posts) but I'll give it a go; her entire vote changes in the early game came across as town, especially the change for an answer in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5449388#p5449388\">Post 41</a>. I found her read on Orestes in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5451286#p5451286\">Post 84</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5451319#p5451319\">Post 86</a> as very very natural and the request for an alternate viewpoint is town motivated. The statement that she did a scum read of Banksys meta in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5452368#p5452368\">Post 113</a> reads town as does the follow up pushing for information from Street and the explanation behind her vote in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5453430#p5453430\">Post 145</a>.

I liked his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5450939#p5450939\">Post 76</a>, the statement that he liked the Flaeron wagon or at least <span style=\"font-style: italic\">did</span> but wants to check it again reads as actually him re-considering his reads. Also liked the explanation that his post was unedited and his thoughts as he was having them. His explanation for his specific vote; him voting to join a wagon he liked since so many 1-man wagons aren't helpful is a very understandable and town motivated line of thinking. Will admit it's slightly weakened by his inactivity but still think the wagon on him needs to disappear, so many better places for votes.<br><br>I actually am one of \"those\" people that have a town read on <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Kid A</span> too, I could very much understand his vote in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5449947#p5449947\">Post 51</a> with his reasoning in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5450383#p5450383\">Post 70</a>, it's not a stance I agree with but I can see how he got to that conclusion and it comes across as a genuine attempt at scumhunting.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Null:</span><br><br>I do think that <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Quadraxis</span> V/LA statement pre-game without having posted in the thread is something that's slightly more likely to come from scum since they have pre-game discussion and day-talk to post it in but that's kind of a lame way to read people so I'll just wait on some content from him.<br><br>Not sure at all with TSO here, there's something that I can't talk about that does point towards him being town, relates to scum having day talk and him stating that he forgot about the game entirely in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5452516#p5452516\">Post 120</a>, there's a chance you can connect the dots there. But he's been avoiding the thread since then given <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/search.php?author_id=20887&amp;sr=posts\" class=\"postlink\">his recent posts</a>. Do either of you have a link to a scum game of his that I can quickly read through or just a summary over whether lurking and avoiding the early game is a scum tell for him or not? <br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><span style=\"color: #FF0000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Scum (Strongest to weakest):</span></span></span><br><br>I actually skimmed <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">TvK's</span> meta but I don't know how and I feel like a fucking idiot but I've forgotten what I learned and will have to do it again later (It was something like I've only ever seen him as town and couldn't find a scum game to properly compare it to but can't remember how much his town play here matched his games play). I'm reading his play this game as very mechanical though which is how I play as scum, the phrasing behind his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5449834#p5449834\">Post 44</a> reads as him awkwardly trying to fencesit on SG and the explanation behind it in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5450281#p5450281\">Post 65</a> doesn't really explain it to me at all. There's also a lot of him setting up to vote people down the line which reads as scum leaving their options open; examples being his read Orestes in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5450337#p5450337\">Post 67</a> on Kid A and ICE in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5454708#p5454708\">Post 178</a> and Fitz and Milked in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5455511#p5455511\">Post 210</a>.

I'd probably stick this guy just under Orestes and just above Kid A in the town section at the moment but I really need another look at <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5449934#p5449934\">Post 49</a> because I remember being bothered by it when I was following along but I'm kind of leaning the other way on it right now and I'm not in the right mind-state to make a conclusive decision.<br><br>I don't find <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">HavingFitzs</span> <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5448335#p5448335\">Post 6</a> as scummy like you guys apparently do, it comes across as a very understandable question to ask given the OP didn't state if and who they hydra's were. Also didn't see an issue with <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5448374#p5448374\">Post 9</a>, I read the \"Is that a problem\" line as more a question of if someone stated the hydras incorrectly and wanting it to be cleared up.

A little conflicted on his catch up wall in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5455000#p5455000\">Post 187</a>, I like his transition on his ICE read and the majority of his town reads but the attack and vote on Herself seems really forced and the usage of words like \"amusing\" and ridiculous\" (Very similar to the \"interesting\" tell that I still think is a thing, that being that scum use particular words to avoid taking stances on things but still \"commenting\" on it) when referring to peoples scum reads on him don't read genuine at all. I'll take a look at his meta later tomorrow because I remember he did have a few specific tells, I think Empires spot on in that I remember his town catch ups had more stances and \"controversial\" opinions whereas his scum catch ups had a lot more fluff, think his catch up here is a lot more like his scum ones but I'll need to check when I do the meta reading. I'd probably stick him just under TvK and just above Milked on my scum list at the moment.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5456928#p5456928\" class=\"postlink\">post 261</a>, TvK wrote:</cite>Anyway, I'm having a hard time reading people in here. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Too many people come across as town</span></div></blockquote><br>I got the exact opposite vibe from you when I read through, there's a lot of people you've voiced concern with and it's one of my largest issues with you; reads as leaving lots of doors open for later.

I'm actually debating a TvK vote being that it looks like there's no hope for a Herself lynch today.

I'm not the kind of person who gets over things quickly or easily (I once had to refrain from posting in a game for something like an entire week because Thor personally insulted me and pissed me off) and I only brought it up because you asked me why I've been giving your slot the cold shoulder. As for the Banksys thing, I already explained when Regfan replaced in that I was trying to field a reaction from her (though I did honestly find her initial posts kind of suspicious, I exaggerated a bit for that reason). I saw in her town game that she got a lot more emotional / passionate in her interactions with people so I saw the opportunity to get an easy townread there."}

The remainder of players, Milked, T S O, and TvK , include two contentless players who seem like their lack of content is more scum motivated than town motivated. I'm really uncomfortable with people defending T S O. Then there's TvK who certainly posts enough words, but the amount of uncertain and waffling language gives him WAY too much room to go back on his reads later which I often associate with scum. Sure town can have a few weak or uncertain reads but the wording he uses, passes he gives, and a lack of pressure really worries me.<br><br>I hate this. I'm usually so confident by now of a solid scum read, and the best thing I have is 3 players who seem scummy, even though I don't really have much of a substantial case on them. Part of me is thinking that this game is just going to be over in a flash, easy scum lynched, but I can't shake the feeling that we're going to be taking a player like Herself or Nutsy to lylo and they'll have been scum all along.<br><br>I feel like the best thing we can do right now is lynch the easy scum first, because there's almost certainly at least one scum in the [TvK, Milked, T S O] bracket then save the paranoia for after scum has chopped a few of the overwhelmingly town reads down.<br><br>If someone wants to make a case for why I should move my vote off T S O and on to TvK or Milked, go for it. If someone wants me to move my vote to one of my \"meh\" reads, you're welcome to try but it better be a strong case if you want any hope."}

He posted something similar here in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5456928#p5456928\" class=\"postlink\">#261</a>, which could explain the weirdness in his lists. ffery thinks the posts are somewhat different in that on Open 395 he was talking about the distinction between finding people anti-town vs. finding them scummy (latter requires much more certainty from him) whereas here he's focusing on scummy behavior.

It means that the person is following the thread intensely enough to know whether they've been mentioned or not but only willing to come in and refer to that rather than their thoughts and reads on the game which is very much scum motivated. Glad to ICE sees it the same way I do too.<br><br>TvK, I wanted an answer to <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5458367#p5458367\">Post 305</a>, your reads list there doesn't match your \"lots of town reads\" comment so walk me through where I'm wrong please. <br><br>Mollie, you're best off just going straight to Empire and asking him because he knows my town vs scum play like the back of his hand (Just like how I know his) though Fferys assessment is relatively close to right, missing a few distinctions though.<br><br>Now to the meaty section; I agree entirely with Slaxx's point on HavingFitz's vote change in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5461742#p5461742\">Post 394</a>, him suddenly scum reading TSO and changing his vote to him when there looked to be a potential wagon forming reads as opportunistic and he's also right in that Fitz constantly repeated his scum read on Herself but never actually attempted to gather support to lynch them, just to de-credit them and attack their points on him. I went back and re-read his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5458457#p5458457\">Post 311</a> again and Desps points about the \"town reads\" in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5459162#p5459162\">Post 330</a> is literally spot on; if Fitz really scum read Herself he'd have been following their posts and their reads and would have noticed that their town-reads mesh with his entirely and thus wouldn't have made that comment. Also another <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">BIG thing I noticed is that the <span style=\"font-style: italic\">\"I\u2019m not sure I could be sheeping you. Given your push on me I doubt you can recognize town\"</span> comes across as if he knows that Herself is town which contradicts with him having a scum read on them, especially the strength he claims to have one.</span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"> Vote: Fitz </span>"}

But, since I'm a hairless ape known as \"human,\" I managed to fuck it up. Quadraxis will march on in future games, and you can experience it quite vividly in <span style=\"font-style: italic\">Metroid Prime 2: Echoes</span>. The hard, time-consuming part was figuring out how to configure the flavor text and actions. If only I hadn't mussed it up it'd be firing twenty shots at people, warping in and out, and charging up a massive charge-shot among other things. But, since that account was a fabrication of my over-active imagination, I can still do all of that and more as of right now.  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":giggle:\" title=\"Giggling\"> <br><br>So Scum have daytalk. Pay close attention to any weirdness where it seems like two people are talking in tandem occasionally, as if they've rehearsed their discussion in their QT first and are now acting on it.

Also, ICE, we should take our paranoia up a notch <span style=\"font-style: italic\">selectively</span> in regards to daytalk. Raise it regarding that only, instead of having everyone go nuts raising their general paranoia over daytalk. Oh, and I'm central time zone (WI), and our time is set back due to daylight's saving time, so it's 8AM as of this very moment of typing.<br><br>And I do wonder your initial vote for Herself ICEninja. You note that she spoke of Sakura but voted for Fitz, and you think that's justification enough for voting for her. Kindly explain that thought process to the class why don't you? Hell, I do the same thing while shooting my Annihilator Beam at other people; it's destructive yet helpful multi-tasking. What'd you think of that, huh? Guess I must be uber-Scummy, so by your logic you should park your vote on yours truly. Come on now, I want to see some conviction behind your words. Don't be too jumpy\u2014a victim of your own heightened paranoia. Too much paranoia can be a detriment to Town as well you know. Yeah, Scum can be really hard to find, but make damned sure you're aren't picking off Town in your paranoia. Don't make me have to keep your paranoia in check, please.<br><br>Squirrel Hana, I don't particularly like your deliberate sheeping of random votes in (18). Don't sheep. You're not a sheep. You're not a squirrel. You're a thinker, so think and think hard. For yourself. Don't sheep, 'cause that's like following someone else's lead just because, and that person you're following could be going off a cliff. You don't want to fall off a cliff, so don't be a sheep. (26) and (27) are kinda dumb, too, because you and ICEninja go for SH with little to no reason. Explanation would be nice, and Bansys Flareon's comment in (29) leaves much to be desired in way of Towniness. She likes being tricksy clever, and I do find that attractive. TMI? TMI. Moving on.<br><br>I see no problem with Street Hassle Townhunting as well, so long as he keeps quiet about it to not give Scum a reason to follow his advice. He could be Scum, too, but that's universal for everyone. Speaking of hydras, would both of you hydras (all four of you people) be so kind as to denote which one of you is posting (like putting in your name)? Town likes clarity. I want clarity. You can give clarity. Win win win. What do you say? If I'm understanding ICEninja correctly in (35), I can agree with his sentiments about BF contradicting herself a bit. And Squirrel Girl takes a decidedly contrary stance on his post, immediately thereafter. Why? (38) sees ICEninja making a somewhat reasonable comment in response to her, noting that SG sheeped his non-serious votes yet questions his serious one. Huh, maybe you should persue that further ICE. The latter part of SG's (40) rubs me the wrong way, because it kindof seems like a non-chalant way of brushing off suspicion. No nuts for you, girl.<br><br>HEY. Don't be making declarative statements with exceptional evidence. YOU. Yeah, YOU, Street Hassle. You say BF is Scum. You want votes to garner your credibility? Give us damned good reasons for your divination why don't you?

You really should explain yourself here, otherwise I've got some charge-shots with your name on it, and I don't miss, and these mother-fucking beams have homing capabilities. TvK, please give us some more insight with your (44). We're trying to find Scum, so being cryptic with short little sentences don't exactly butter our breads.

You are probably the only one in the room who didn't/doesn't want to understand that when I told ffery (who would absolutely understand my meaning) I wanted to work with X, Y, and Z, that X, Y, and Z were town.<br><br>5. /sigh...No, it doesn't, but the entirety of Kid A's content up to the point where I had read him as town was his early Orestes push.

But when I read a thread and someone\u2019s thoughts differ a lot from mine I get suspicious of them. If you can\u2019t understand that one doesn\u2019t exclude the other then fine, I can\u2019t make you understand it.\t<br>3.\tNo reasoning isn\u2019t the same as evidence. I am speculating when I am reasoning, evidence is facts. I got no facts that proves you are scum. Nothing. But I do BELIEVE it, and I provide my reasons for why I BELIEVE it.<br>4.\tYeah, you made it clear in post # 136 that you wanted to work with them hence they are town. Me writing that you didn\u2019t provide reads is therefore slightly inaccurate portray, but it is just wordtwisting. I still believe that that post isn\u2019t a good readpost, and that is the point. Please stop bickering about such silly things as this it is just immaterial.<br>5.\tI get it. But I read Kid A\u2019s post 70 as well. And I thought: \u201cStates his opinion clearly, a slight townpoint. Even though he is being abit lurky\u201d. So I also gave him a townpoint for it, even without agreeing that my slot was scum."}

Have you had trouble understanding my stances? Is that why you find me scummy?</div></blockquote><br><br>1.\tIt is always hard to deduct whether something is done for townie or scummy reasons. You also have to account for player skills here. But since I don\u2019t know whether someone is good or bad in this game (haven\u2019t got any experience with any of you, except some games I have replaced out of) I have default bad=scum attitude. With this said. Does your logic make sense to me:<br><br>a.\tCorrect me if I am wrong here. But you are voting SH for not wanting to discuss why he metavoted BF in post #43 right? And that the reason for not wanting to discuss it (not having discussed Empires findings in detail) seems fake and made up. <br><br>i.\tIf you believe that this is fake and made up, it is logical for you to believe that SH is scum. So far it is logical.<br><br>ii.\tFferyllt not knowing the entire reasoning behind why Empire thinking BF is scum seems plausible to me. So her reasons for not wanting to discuss it seems logical.<br><br>iii.\tYou believing it to be fake though is plausible. Even though I believe it to be the truth. But since I believe fferyllt is telling the truth I find your reasoning illogical. <br><br>b.\tSo to sum it up I think it is plausible for you to think this as town, but I find it illogical because I believe fferyllt is telling the truth. But it is logical for you to not take fferyllt\u2019s word for it. You having a different stance on this than me, doesn\u2019t isolated tell much about your alignment. I think it is possible for a townplayer to think this, but I find it more plausible that fferyllt told the truth, hence I give you a scumpoint for it.<br><br>2.\tYes I have somewhat been having trouble with understanding your stances and the reasons behind it. Simply because I disagree. You moving your vote around might just be your way of play, you move it whenever someone does something you don\u2019t like, instead of keeping it on the one who in sum looks more scummy. But it could also be a scummove that allows you to vote whoever you want without being held accountable for it."}

I mostly do that to remind myself of connections. I'll often make statements such as \"I'll remember this connection when x player flips as it will have y impact on z player\" so when I go back and re-read the game later I'll find that. Most of my preferred lynched past day 1 are weighed largely by interactions and vote counts, and sometimes I get things in one read-through that I miss in future ones, and some things I get in future read-throughs that I missed the first time around. It's extra tricky to do this with day talk, however, so these statements will probably hold slightly less weight than they do in most of my games.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Waked wrote:</cite>How exactly did Kid A increase on your Scum list significantly?<br></div></blockquote><br>He was lurking heavily, someone asked where he was, and he replied with one word less than 10 minutes after said statement.

It seems town enough that's he's scum hunting, especially since he's bringing new things to the table, but I just don't find his cases convincing. I've had lots of mixed feelings about Herself but I noted that few if any of his reasons for voting Herself significantly resonated. I flat out disagree with almost everything he says about Squirrel Lady, and find most of his points either not scummy or not indicative of alignment at all.<br><br>That being said I feel like his posts addressed to TvK have merit to them.<br><br>Silver feels more or less like misguided town, but I simply can't justify giving him an outright town read at the moment.

I could easily see a player like him not really reading the game and just being given queues who to read as what by day chat buddies and giving bullshit reasoning for it.

The reasoning behind the scum read on Herself in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5466241#p5466241\">Post 503</a> dreadful, A) The entire \"Distancing, interaction scum read\" between them and SG is insanely weak and based on SG being scum which I alone think is wrong. B) The idea that \"Only scum play the emotion card\" is flat out wrong, AtE is actually something that is more player-style based than alignment-based. There are exceptions but generally it's not a solid tell and with Mollie I know for a fact that she's used AtE in the past as town so that's not a scum tell in the slightest. C) The idea of \"X has all different reads to me therefore I think X is scum\" is wrong, people read posts and situations differently, if anything scum are often the ones mimicking the general consensus reads and not branching out for their own ones but looking at this specific situation I had a town-read on Kid A and SG there as well, really the only read they had that was \"weird\" was TSO and apparently that was highly meta-based. <br><br>3B) The reasoning behind the scum read on SG in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5466350#p5466350\">Post 513</a> is even weaker in that A) It again relies on Herself being scum which I don't think is the case B) Constant vote-changing isn't a scum-tell, scum are generally afraid of moving their votes since they'll get called out for it and moving their votes turns players \"against them\" so they prevent doing it whenever possible C) The vote on Street read insanely genuine and was understandable in that she was suspicious of them refraining from outing content (The Banksy meta) which is town based paranoia and D) I had a scum read on Milked too and considered voting him as well, it's not just \"lurking\" it's his initial post coming across as creating a preemptive defence that has more scum motivation. <br><br>3C) I skimmed the rest of TSB vs Herselfs posts and I need to take a break and get back to studying for my last final soon so I'll have to call for a rain check and read his posts in more detail later*. Leaning towards him being scum though which is shitty since it would mean my Orestes read was wrong.<br><br>4) Oh god at Wake being here. At least the dumb Quad gimmick posts will stop. I do read his line of questioning towards ICE in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5465088#p5465088\">Post 473</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5465154#p5465154\">Post 479</a> as townish though. As does the \"interrogation\" of SG in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5466065#p5466065\">Post 491</a> but I need to go back and re-read <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5466044#p5466044\">Post 489</a> later because there's just so much in it to deal with right now but initial impression of it was that the entire summary and thoughts came across as very natural*.<br><br>5) SG, you're going to have to explain your town read on Fitz for me.<br><br>6) I don't like Milkeds <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5466640#p5466640\">Post 530</a> at all, the entire \"What's the case on Orestes and Fitz\" bit while sticking them in \"In between\" reads as insanely scummy given that a great deal of the the entire threads conversation have revolved around the cases on those two. Don't like his read on me either, the \"Scum-reads on lurkers vs Wanting lurkers to be replaced is contradictory\" makes no sense whatsoever, especially if he's claiming to have read the thread, taken a break to think about it all and then got back to it; The reads on the lurkers are severely weaker than on active players, replacements allow more content, more content allows stronger reads. The scum read on Kid A also looks like a \"Push the weaker player\" one rather than a genuine scum read.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">So a real summary since I failed at making the above short:<br></span></span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Town (S-&gt;W): </span>Street, ICE, Herself, SG, TvK, Wake88, LolWagons, Kid A.<br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Null/Need more reading into:</span> Garmr (Hoping his reads list is up soon), TSB (Want to go through his and Herselfs interaction later).<br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Scum (S-&gt;W):</span> HavingFitz, Milked.<br><br>I'd be fully up for either a Fitz or Milked lynch at the moment."}

I feel he's quite honest in his opinion towards how bad her case on him is, and also I do like that he decided to make a scuffle about Herself as a thing to do. Yeah, he tossed in Orestes as a side option, but he was basically picking the biggest or second biggest town dog in the yard and then running over and kicking it.

Meaning that, when you say you believe them, what you believed was them putting off saying anything while not actually being truthful about why, meanwhile I didn't like it, and was correct that they were hiding something for strategic purposes. I have decided that what they did was not really that great, but even if you have decided that what they did was town motivated and legit and everything they said was true - that still means you're suspecting me as scum because I correctly identified that they were being hidden about a read. Now, you can try to explain that as scum me trying to press on them to make a town thing they decided to do look scummy, but don't tell me I had no reason to doubt their word.

If banksys had returned and interacted with us about our suspicions, and we had gotten a reaction that matched what we expected from town-Banksys based on reading completed town and scum games, we probably would have given a pretty brief explanation of why we were unvoting.  If the reaction was more like her scum games in similar situations, then it would have been time to write up a case on her posts that included meta analysis.  Without a decent explanation for why we were seriously scumreading her and wanted others to also vote her, we wouldn't accomplish much."}

The game thread is 24 pages long now.  And some of his naked reads are players with seriously high participation and relative kilotons of content.  Also, where he goes into any detail about the player, it's often regarding purely playstyle based critique.  This jumped out at me when I read his comments about us, one of his stronger town reads:<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>The only annoyance I have is the heavy emphasis on meta.

Just \"annoyance\" over our scumhunting approach.<br><br>This looks like the sort of reads list that I struggle to avoid putting together when I'm scum.  With so little substantive stance, it will be easy to make tactical adjustments.  But the lack of stance is also a lack of stakes in the ground, showing how he's putting pictures together and processing the thread data.<br><br>There's one other thing about his recent play that bothers me.  He threw the reads list up, but has made no effort to engage anyone and refine some of those null or reasonless reads.  There's an exchange between him and garmr, his scum read, and he comes off almost conciliatory, starting a tiny pokemon side discussion with the player he's voting rather than really grappling with garmr.<br><br>I'm not at all happy with Eek.

There are a number of lesser wagons bouncing around and I feel like most of the people voting the big wagons (Eek and Fitz) are being clunky about moving. I am not intending to move because I think Fitz looks a bit townish. I think Reg is in the same boat wherein he doesn't find Eek scummy, hold on...no, I'm wrong, Reg has both as scum. I think Herself has Fitz and Eek as scum. Garmr has Fitz and Eek as scum. TvK has fitz and Eek as scum but is voting Bard for some reason. Street has Fitz and Eek as scum. Lolwagons has expressed I guess agreement that Eek is scummy, but not scummy enough to be worth a vote. In skimming over Wake's iso I actually have a really hard time guessing his reads on anyone. I guess he suspects Garmr...maybe? He needs to produce a lot more, and now I don't like anyone giving him a town read at this stage.<br><br>I guess what I am saying is most players in the game seem to think that *both* Fitz and Eek are scum, and yet we can't get a wagon going on either of them. That seems silly, let's put one to L-1. I personally would rather it be Eek than Fitz, but that's because I'm actually on the record for not thinking both are scum. I could also help out with a Kid A or TvK wagon at this stage. I might even be okay with lynching Lolwagon, I think I'd rather lynch him than Fitz, honestly. I'll also add in support for a Wake wagon now that I realize how empty all his posting is.<br><br>Really, I am strongly in favor of a large wagon being formed at this stage, we're 24 pages in, I think it's time for an L-1 with hammer intent so we can see a claim and talk about that, otherwise we're going to keep talking in circles till deadline."}

I mostly do that to remind myself of connections. I'll often make statements such as \"I'll remember this connection when x player flips as it will have y impact on z player\" so when I go back and re-read the game later I'll find that. Most of my preferred lynched past day 1 are weighed largely by interactions and vote counts, and sometimes I get things in one read-through that I miss in future ones, and some things I get in future read-throughs that I missed the first time around. It's extra tricky to do this with day talk, however, so these statements will probably hold slightly less weight than they do in most of my games....\"</span><br><br><span style=\"color: #0040FF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">005)\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2739</span></span> How exactly did Kid A increase on your Scum list significantly?<br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic\">\"...He was lurking heavily, someone asked where he was, and he replied with one word less than 10 minutes after said statement.

Am I obligated to then come up with a new and unique reason to vote the scum as opposed to sheeping the cop?

Usually it's bad play when one player speaks for another, because in a game sans Masons it really makes people wonder why that's going on. Just as people should provide their own reasoning, they should also defend themselves and take the initiative in starting wagons on other players. Herself(Des) does mention that he wants to defend his townreads and not have them fight each other, but I think the matter is really about the danger of being deceived into defending townreads who are Scum.<br><br>Herself(Des): \"There is a zero chance of us getting lynched ever.\" <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5466291#p5466291\" class=\"postlink\">(508)</a> <br><br>When statements like this are made, it's going to stir up questions. This kind of play could be interpreted in a myriad of ways. So, I'm weighing whether or not it'd be helpful to Town to pursue your statement. Also, I'm not entirely sure what to make of the Herself/Bard fandango.

Unfortunately his bit about my large posts is easily dismissed, because he mentioned nothing about Regfan's large walls, which means his bit was either selective or he hasn't really been reading the thread. That too deserves an explanation. I agree with him a bit about TvK leaning Scum. Also, his reasoning about T S O replacing out because he overreached and was in 11 games is sound, in my opinion, because I had been in ten games at once and was overwhelmed with it and everything pertaining to real-life. T S O is not scummy for replacing out due to biting off more than he could chew.<br><br>TvK your read on me would be appreciated; it was left out in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5468220#p5468220\" class=\"postlink\">(564)</a>.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5468910#p5468910\" class=\"postlink\">post 604</a>, Squirrel Girl wrote:</cite>I showed that I had a town read on ICE and that I was willing to lynch who I was voting.

Random voting is pretty much only used in the very beginning of the game, in order to stir up discussion, and after a handful of pages it ends. Sheeping, on the other hand, has no such ephemeral use. That, and it's a thoughtless action that requires little to no thought from the person doing so. The fact that you thought ICEninja was Town when you sheeped means nothing, unfortunately. Sheeping without original reason is bad enough, but lynching without reason is far worse. The RVS is more useful than sheeping, and past the RVS, brainpower and original posts and reasons will always be far more helpful to Town than the alternative.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5468910#p5468910\" class=\"postlink\">post 604</a>, Squirrel Girl wrote:</cite>And, with ICE's third vote I didn't sheep it and expressed disagreement with it - so clearly I was only sheeping so long as I was okay with his reasoning.

The Cop scenario is far different, because if the person claiming to be the Cop is not counterclaimed, and he/she has a \"guilty\" on someone else, then there is compelling reason to vote with the Cop. And, if the claimed Cop is lying, he or she is to be lynched with all due haste. ICEninja din't claim to be a Cop with a guilty result, so your reasoning here is inherently flawed. While your feedback is appreciated, your actions appear to betray your innocence.

Also, the biggest part of your reasoning could easily fall apart if your other reads were wrong (for example agreeing with SG would seem scummy in your eyes, because SG is scum in your book), and believe me or not, it is possible to have wrong reads. Your case might look really good to yourself, but you'll have to do a lot better to convince the players in here. <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">(2)</span><br><br>Then, now that SG is \"rubbing you the right way\".

I wish I was better at writing convincing arguements and being able to persuade others, but I am not. But you guys can read and form your own opinions you don't need a good convincing case to vote for someone. But you can agree and disagree, and by that see if my reasoning is far away from your own, and that is something you can use to make up your mind about me.<br><br>3. SG is still in the neutral corner, but I like her more and more. I do review my reads at certain points. For instance SG going back to neutral means that my arguements which rely on Herself and SG being scumbuddies needs to be reviewed.

I vaguely remember something about him being drunk that was blown way out of proportion. -I just went back to orestes ISO just to see if anything else sticks out and I really, really can't get anything else but a town read on him, so I don't really get what the case is on orestes.

I should have posted that elaborated post, but I didn't. Ha, seeing this makes me laugh about my introduction paragraph.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5469115#p5469115\" class=\"postlink\">post 605</a>, Wake88 wrote:</cite>I thought Eek was gone. He's not though, and is showing that he too can provide his own insightful contributions to this game. Reasoning for his Town reads on SG and ICE would be nice. Input on Herself would also be swell. Unfortunately his bit about my large posts is easily dismissed, because he mentioned nothing about Regfan's large walls, which means his bit was either selective or he hasn't really been reading the thread. That too deserves an explanation. I agree with him a bit about TvK leaning Scum. Also, his reasoning about T S O replacing out because he overreached and was in 11 games is sound, in my opinion, because I had been in ten games at once and was overwhelmed with it and everything pertaining to real-life. T S O is not scummy for replacing out due to biting off more than he could chew.</div></blockquote><br>If I'm alive in +-12 hours I'll make a post/reply to this post.

Then for quite a few posts he continues to play this game. Right when the heat is turned up on him to a noticeable degree is exactly when he disappears, without anything.. No \"sorry I tried but I just can't keep up\" or excuse about being too busy IRL or anything.<br><br>As I said before, he knew he was goosed and got out.<br><br>But no one except fitz seems to recognize that so I guess we're lynching Eek (or fitz, but I definitely prefer Eek).<br><br>Also Bard, you seriously need to learn how to only quote relevant sections of a post.</div></blockquote><br>No, that is exactly the point. He was in over his head with 11 games. He might have dropped a few games, but this one was going nowhere and was on page 14-15 when he made that post you linked. If I were in his place, I'd be dropping this game too in favor of other games, regardless of alignment.

Your posts are so huge and so many of them that I had to postpone reading one due to the length of it, I wouldn't say they\"re \"content-less\" though, just not concise and I'm guilty of doing the same thing too (Something we should both be working on) and I think you're focusing on things that aren't big tells and some semantics.<br><br>I actually really like Garmrs <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5470195#p5470195\">Post 620</a>, especially the Fitz interaction (If Fitz is scum this dude is town, same vice versa).<br><br>Up to the top of 26 now.

And him getting into an argument with someone is generally typical Fitz (He's kind of like Thor in that right) but what I'm reading as scummy is exactly what you're pointing out his focus has pretty much solely been on Herself and his votes elsewhere (Oretes for example) come across as opportunistic and not a legitimate scum read, another thing is something that Garmr pointed out, Fitz had Garmr as town in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5455000#p5455000\">Post 187</a> then shifted him to scum in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5468362#p5468362\">Post 566</a> after Garmr had him as scum. The change of read mirrors how he's dealt with Herself, ie. De-crediting pushing back on attackers (He even said the \"Feel bad about Regfan voting me\" too). And again I think <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">the entire tone of his back and forth with Herself comes across as him convincing them they're wrong about him (In a manner that he knows they're town) while accusing them of being scum.</span><br><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5471654#p5471654\" class=\"postlink\">post 651</a>, Squirrel Girl wrote:</cite>I also find your Garmr/Fitz interaction read kind of weird.

Going from hazy memory: The scum game was a lost cause (I believe I replaced into a very bad situation?) and the town game was a disaster (iirc, not sure).<br><br>I also elaborated on Kid A and I'm going to post that garm post soonish (next few hours).<br><br>Your little fitz-eek scum scenario makes no sense whatsoever. Could you honestly see us \"buddy up\" our concurrent wagons to avoid either one of us getting lynched if we were scum together? (ICEninja disclaimer: hypothetical situation). This makes no sense in any scenario of us being scum together. And the reason I'd like everyone to swing to garm is because I find him a lot more scummy than fitz. It just so happens that your opinion of a productive/town lynch candidate is the wagonee accusing or jumping on a concurrent wagon regardless of how he feels about that bandwagon apparently. I just happen to find garm scummy.

Coincidence or not; the three people he mentions in his post are all town or leaning town imo (ICEninja disclaimer: imo)<br>#162 \"Remember that time that I mentioned banksys before?

Again, \"interaction\" with one of his 4. And then he follows it up with \"Yeah, I had nothing on banksys.\" (paraphrased)<br>#541 Non-committal about orestes. WHAT? After a small 500 posts of making sure that we know that he suspects orestes, he just drops it because he might flake? As I said before, a flake is not indicative of alignment.

A few things wrong with his read: He would like \"fitz gone for obvious reasons\". From reading his posts, this obvious reason is that he can only vote for people who are being wagonned. And orestes.

I myself have done something similar under such constraints, and was Town. That you have continued to push this angle leaves more questions than answers at this point. He may indeed be Scum my friend, but from that bit alone I cannot hang him. I've yet to hear anything truly convincing from you as to why we should lynch Eek; sure, we are running out of time, but I'm inclined to believe that we still have some time. If you would please give me truly compelling reasons to vote for Eek, I will do so. As it is so far, I see no reason to hang him, either. <br><br>The all-CAPS sentence in the former part of your (621) does little to allay my suspicions of you, instead making me think that bit comes from Scum. Furthermore, Scum may or may not be stalling; I know games where Scum was all-too-active, and it was the town who were dragging their feet. Are you eager to see me vote, ICE? One of the few things I have complete and utter control over is my precious vote, and I'm rather careful with using it. Perhaps you are Scum who wants me to get my vote cast, so that you have even more material to use at your disposal? Combined with the currently flimsy reasons for casting suspicion on Eek and T S O, I'm beginning to see you as Null-Town/Leaning-Scum. Though I have all the respect in the world for you, I cannot in good faith agree with some of your current actions. <br><br>You really have a lot of explaining to do, ICE, and if you don't I'll be focusing my beam at you AFTER the the salvo of 19 have already struck their marks. One unique thing about my Annihilator Beam shots is that when they're ignore or brushed-off, they have homing capabilities causing them to never, ever go away. If you continue leaving much to be desired in way of innocence you could be looking at well over 30 shots coming towards you. And yeah, you're a nice guy in general. In (638) you said you were thinking the exact same thing TSB was thinking, about there being some dubious/interesting link between Eek and Fitz. When he said that I didn't understand it at all, and with you agreeing with it in spite of my ability to understand it the first thing that came to my mind was that you two were Scum members. You later mention the weirdness of the Street/Eek interaction, which again, bluntly, I don't fully understand. I never commit to anything I don't thoroughly understand.<br><br>While it's true Eek needs to step it up, I'm getting the sense that you're Scum looking for leverage to vote off the presumably easy lynch. <br><br> <span style=\"font-style: italic\">\"...The fact that scum is probably scattered about voting useless votes to run us up to deadline...\" \"...I would be willing to bet the game that there is 1 (probably 2) scum in that group of 6 people stalling this out....\"</span> How do you reconcile the existence of games where all 3-4 Scum were on one wagon? What convinces you that Scum is moreso scattered rather than focused? <br><br>...ICE, I'm becoming increasingly troubled with your stance. In (647) you again try to find ways to subdue and bring down Eek, like a lion trying to bring down a water buffalo. <br><br>As it is right now, I see you as either paranoid Town or persistent Scum. <br><br>Combining those two and take a slice out of the middle, <span class=\"noboldsig\">my current read on ICEninja is that he's Null</span>. ICE, your full response would be great, as well as everyone else's input."}

I suppose in a game where we have this many competent pro-town players it would be possible, but it just feels implausible that town wagoned two scum already. I don't really want to focus too hard on who is scum for day 2 yet, but I tend to be transparent about what certain flips will make me feel about others. And just about every game I do it someone calls me out for \"lining up lynches\" or something along those lines but I'm going to keep doing it because I think being clear about that sort of thing is the correct play.<br><br>However look at this: The Eek wagon was so close to closing out then all the sudden at the last second a Garmr wagon explodes out of nowhere. This is exactly what I would expect to happen if Eek was scum. It's damn hard to lynch scum on day 1, and wagons on scum fall apart at the drop of a hat. I will admit that Eek put together a half decent case on Garmr, but it is just too little too late for me to be convinced that Garmr is scum and Eeked is town. Also the way that Eek's wagon just fell apart in favor of what is probably an easily pushed mislynch at this point (Garmr) makes me fairly confident of where my vote is.<br><br>Now to respond to Wake:<br><blockquote><div><cite>Wake wrote:</cite>Apologies, ICE, but I'm not buying that T S O's scummy for replacing out when in so many games and under such time constraints. I myself have done something similar under such constraints, and was Town. That you have continued to push this angle leaves more questions than answers at this point.<br></div></blockquote><br>I found it really scummy, and I was frustrated as hell that hardly anyone else saw it. I suppose it's possible that I was wrong, but it just seems super damning to me. I continued to push it because I continued to believe it.<br><br>That being said, I recognized that his lynch wasn't going to happen today so I more or less dropped it except when people brought it up, at least for now.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Wake wrote:</cite>I've yet to hear anything truly convincing from you as to why we should lynch Eek; sure, we are running out of time, but I'm inclined to believe that we still have some time.<br></div></blockquote><br>If you haven't been convinced by what I've said then you probably aren't going to be convinced. I'm happy with where my vote is, I've given ample reasoning for it, and multiple players have found my reasons sound and have agreed with me. I honestly can live with a few players disagreeing with me so long as we don't end up lynching retarded, like say Garmr. You may be less paranoid about running out of time but I've been in games where we go right up to deadline and it is stressful as HELL. Not everyone is online, people change their vote to places they're less happy with it, and scum usually get their way (and sometimes multiple claims if they're lucky. I do NOT want that happening here).<br><blockquote><div><cite>Wake wrote:</cite>Scum may or may not be stalling; I know games where Scum was all-too-active, and it was the town who were dragging their feet.<br></div></blockquote><br>Who benefits from avoiding all the lynchable wagons until the very last second? Who benefits from making themselves harder to read in the vote counts? That's right, scum do. I like your content so I'm having a hard time pinning you as scum (and I'm glad no one took my suggestion to policy lynch you seriously, I apologize for that by the way I was just incredibly frustrated with the state of the game), but the fact that you continue to hold your vote doesn't seem to serve any town purpose.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Wake wrote:</cite>How do you reconcile the existence of games where all 3-4 Scum were on one wagon? What convinces you that Scum is moreso scattered rather than focused? <br></div></blockquote><br>The fact that there hasn't been a wagon of more than 3 or 4 people this game pretty much period. I think there might have been a couple pages where Eek had 5? Sure some games scum pile their votes on, but think about it. Scum have day talk. This game has been dragging on RIDICULOUSLY. There were (at the time of me making that post) 6 players with solo votes or no votes, which is just shy of <span style=\"font-style: italic\">half the players in this game</span>. There weren't 3 scum on one wagon, I would bet the game on it.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Wake wrote:</cite>In (647) you again try to find ways to subdue and bring down Eek, like a lion trying to bring down a water buffalo.<br><br>As it is right now, I see you as either paranoid Town or persistent Scum. <br></div></blockquote><br>I'm not sure how to respond to that. Eek referred to Street scum hunting him as busing a scum buddy. It looked like Eek screwed up and admitted something he hasn't, don't tell me you've never seen noob scum do that before.<br><br>At least now it feels like you're actually reading my posts."}

Pretty sure most everyone has commented on it, either saying they dont understamd it or they agree with it. I singled him out because he specifically admitted to not paying attention/ not remembering it. ITs way easier to see one person who says \"i have no stance\" than it is to ISO all 13 players and see who commented and who didnt.

Instead of scumhunting he have written a lot of posts that say nothing. He got 81 posts in his filter, and a large part of them is fluff. Why is fluff scummy? Well, it is harder for scum to write something sensible about the game, and it is easier to just troll around, post questions that aren\u2019t going nowhere and in general just do stuff that make them seem active.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">2.\tA lack of reasoning/sheeping:</span><br>He have given very few reasons as to why his reads are as they are. Most of it is either him sheeping, or him writing up some poorly reasoned explanations. I will say that he haven\u2019t provided any reasons on his own for any of his scumreads: MME, havingfitz (where he is blatantly sheeping Herself) and me. Why is this scummy? It is harder to make up reasons as scum than it is to give genuine reads and reasons as town. Also not providing reasons makes it easier to fly under the radar.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">3.\tGoing for the easy targets:</span><br>His target for scum have been people who early on lurked (or was V/LA), and who later have been scumreads on a majority of the players readlists. The way he have approached it is also very cautious, where he have first expressed just a slight suspicion, or a willingness to maybe join this wagon if anyone gets it rolling. Why is this scummy? Going with the majority seems safe. And if you aren\u2019t the one pushing hardest, you won\u2019t become the one who receives the most attention. You can also lean on others arguments, not having to make them up yourself.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">4.\tInconsistency</span><br>His game have been full of inconsistency. He spent the entire start of the game arguing that sheeping was bad for town. Later he have done nothing but sheeping others cases. When I entered the game he was slightly cautious of Herself, but later and seemingly without a reason he is now sheeping her and have her as one of his townreads. He got a townread on Regfan, that not very much later is someone he is suddenly suspicious of (when someone else mentions they are suspicious of him) and which in turn again ends up in a townread in his readpost. <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">5.\tOther stuff</span><br>He responds to posts that mention himself, and is eager to defend himself. He doesn\u2019t comment on other things in these posts until much later, and usually after someone else thinks something in those posts are scummy.  He is overly defensive, and anxious when he is mentioned, or in the case where EMM was about to write a case on him.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">So Garmr is clearly scum and should be our lynch today.</span>"}

I was straight up trying to bait him with the question I just asked about familiarity and I'm honestly not for sure where I stand on it now. I'll give him a chance to explain why he made the jump he did but I wanted to see a response from him before he knew what I was getting at."}

Also agree with the \"Town-slip\" in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5472271#p5472271\">Post 689</a>. <br><br>Didn't like TvK's vote change to Garmr in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5472246#p5472246\">Post 682</a> but TSB's vote change on Garmr is actually significantly worse than TvK's, the \"Townie\" post being #49 doesn't make sense at all especially with his reasoning \"not taking stances\" should be a scum-tell and a lot of the \"Scummy\" points are things that can be attributed to anyone. Also read Silvers <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5473128#p5473128\">Post 738</a> as a fairly big scum-tell, especially the <span style=\"font-style: italic\"> \"Heck, you can even lynch me first if you promise to lynch Garmr on day 2\"</span>, it's a blatant gambit considering there's currently 0 votes on him and we're nearing the deadline.

With each passing Day the information gathered becomes increasingly helpful, because these older reactions can be cross-referenced with the actions of the present. The information gathered is only useful if you use it. You may use it to build cases, augment questions, contradict people's current actions, whatever. I've got some suspicions based on these reactions and other discussions, but because it is Day 1 there's likely not going to be enough weight to lynch someone while having some vestige of certainty. At this point I'm not exactly sure what to do with the information being amassed. My current gut Scum reads are SG and ICEninja, and Kid A is the wildcard., although there's not much in way of damning evidence. Another thing that needs to be made clear is that I'm really trying to focus on and absorb every single post and interaction in this game, and it's a bit exhausting. I've now had to break out my notebook and pen to start sifting through all of the latest activity. Lastly myquestions stir up discussion, so that's yet another benefit to Town. <br><br>Havingfitz, what does \"wrt\" mean? That's been popping up quite a bit and it's been bugging me because I haven't understood it. Regarding Herself's stance on policy-lynching lurkers, it really depends; I have no problem lynching flakes or deliberate lurkers. It does seem a little ridiculous that Herself would encourage votes on you so soon after coming off V/LA. With T S O I don't fault him for replacing out from being in too many games. Logically, both Town and Scum can and <span style=\"font-style: italic\">have</span> done so in the past. Fitz, exactly what other efforts did T S O try against you, please? You do alarm me a bit when you mention that anyone who calls your alignment into question is suspicious. Does it make you suspicious if, say, you suspect someone else's alignment? I'm fairly certain I saw you and Garmr going at it, getting inflamed and spitting fire. I may be wrong, though.<br><br>Eek, my questions aren't meant to solely target the present. The past is as rich for asking questions as the present is. Also, as respectfully as I can say it it really doesn't matter if you say or think it's already been answered somewhere else in the past. A show of good Town faith is to at least try and answer questions directed your way; it's unlikely you'd like it if someone simply said \"no\" and \"it's been answered already\" in response to you when you really don't know they've exactly done so. It's doubtful you'd want me assuming which questions you have or haven't answered, and you definitely don't want me guessing at their meanings (especially if you're Scum). With all the respect I can muster, these questions really do matter. I'm afraid the notion that I'm a \"non-entity\" in this game is as absurd as it is offensive; detail for everyone my ISO and prove that I've said or contributed nothing, please. And before I forget, because she hasn't been around, what do you think of Squirrel Girl?<br><br>ICEninja, I like you but it's becoming a bit trying to not start aggressively leading your wagon. You imply my questions are shitty and pointless. I don't understand your non-logic, and I'll challenge you to point out and explain exactly which questions are shitty and pointless. The implication by you and Eek that they were already answered (Oh, were they? Definitively?) doesn't matter, because I'm asking you <span style=\"font-style: italic\">at that moment</span>, so I can gather the data <span style=\"font-style: italic\">straight from you</span>, in a format in which I can easily organize and store it. I understand that you're \"getting really twitchy\" about me, so I guess I'll have to pay you more mind by keeping a watchful eye on you. Because you're now on my radar, I've got some questions for you. Why do you assume these questions are so \"empty, pointless, irrelevant, and shitty?\" You know, I'm starting to think you're Scum because your attempt to diminish my information-gathering feels more than a little forced. Again, I challenge you to prove that bit of yours, or let it go once and for all. If you were Scum you'd have every single reason in the world to put a lid on Townies who are trying to gather info, so I'm asking you to stop it, and if you don't I'll have no choice but to judge you as Scum and become your impediment. The more Town has to look back on when in future Days, the more valuable that information will be. Lastly, you really don't need to speak on someone else's behalf: everyone here is capable of of defending his or her own positions.<br><br>Squirrel Girl is the other gut Scum read I have, but at this moment all I have are a collection of attempts by her to find fault in my actions. By the way, where has she gone? Street Hassle feels more or less detached and aloof, so it's a little difficult trying to get a read on him. Kid A hasn't been around much, at all. Garmr's bothered to answer my questions like a gentleman. The Silver Bard, well, I haven't got much of a read on him either, although I've read past the time I wrote this post and got scum vibes from his attempt to push a lynch on Garmr. I like the Desperado half of Herself, but I met unexpected resistance from the Mollie side; if Herself is Scum, Desperado would be wise to keep Mollie in check. I'm not sure about Fitz (and beyond this chunk of thought I see he's claimed semi-Vig PR). Street Hassle should find some fire in its gut belly and step more into the fray; I don't recall him even asking me questions or making a case. Come on you two. Engage. I keep forgetting TvK is in this game. Regfan has a reputation of sorts for providing a lot of content, yet in this game even a dummy like me seems to be providing more content than him. It could be that he's legitimately busy, or he's Scum. If we were going to go the safest route and vote off the flakes/lurkers... or weakest links... it'd be Kid A on today's chopping block. I'd rather lynch a non-contributing player Day 1 than an unknown who's been pulling his or her own weight. Town is only as strong as its weakest link, so if you believe in that we should lynch Kid A today (providing he doesn't roleclaim something useful). Kid, you can either replace out, or show us you're worth keeping around.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Kid A</span><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic\">*Written up last night.

I was too busy focusing on the lurkers at the start of the game (note my constant suspicion of Orestes and the fact that I never liked Eek or TSO), that I felt fine with having a nullread on Garmr even though he never really contributed, but at least he did post something. I still didn't think about him as Garmr when I got thrown off by Bard's posts that seemed really scummy to me. But then Garmr asked me some questions in #565, to which I responded in #571. I don't know if you can really notice it in the post itself, but I went in with Garmr as null and when I finished writing it, I had convinced myself that Garmr's play had been fishy all game long.<br><br>Now Fitz comes into the equasion. My scumread on Fitz was a combination of one of my strongest townreads (you) constantly attacking him without him being able to, in my opinion, say something townish. But from the moment that I thought Garmr was looking scummier, Fitz suddenly looked a bit better in the light I was looking at the game now. Both Eek's and Fitz's posts seemed more than enough to me to join the Garmr wagon."}

Day 3, if you're still alive, then town needs to make that a priority.  If we haven't eliminated 1 scum by then, consensus should be a little suspect, though, due to the percentage of scum represented in the reduced player list.  I hope whoever of town is still kicking will have a good idea who they feel are strong-town.  Those opinions should be weighted more heavily."}

So Herself was shot and no one else? That bugs me a little, but also kind of makes sense.<br><br>There are quite a few possibilities here.<br><br>The obvious: Fitz is lying scum and he shot Herself. There are no other kill roles. However, Herself was definitely a suboptimal scum target unless they had some idea she was a PR. I was fully expecting either Street (ffery) or Regfan to die tonight, with the possibility of Wake. I figured I would survive the night as several players started shifting their reads on me towards scummy.<br><br>Very likely: We have a town doctor/role blocker/jail keeper. I feel like 2 masons, vig, and JK all together is probably too strong but RB and doctor aren't crazy strong roles, and those 4 against a fairly strong scum team (including day talk, never forget that god damn day talk) could potentially match up. I agree that the likelihood of an information role in cop/tracker/watcher is fairly low. I'll hold any setup speculation, but <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">this is the situation I believe is the most likely for reasons I really don't want to say</span>. The fact that both Ffery and Reg were super town power players makes scum shooting one of them super obvious, so it wouldn't really be that hard for one of those roles to guess which one.<br><br>Also possible: Scum could have potentially held their bullet and let fitz shoot, if they simply knew his reads were wrong and he was going to shoot town for them ANYWAY, giving scum a nice little benefit of being able to speed lynch fitz today. I don't believe this scenario is partiuclarly likely, however, as no one has jumped up and said they want fitz dead right away.<br><br>Then there's the GOD THIS BETTER NOT BE THE FUCKING CASE: If fitz is a VT and claimed vig to survive then I will never play with him again. If this is the case, fitz, you better just tell us <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">right now</span>.<br><br>For the record I more or less believe the claim (once again, it's too confirmable, scum knows for a fact fitz is dead if they fake claim a vig), but I'm a little skeptical now. I'm going to put fitz as suspicious, but it is risky as hell for scum to leave him alive so if he's scum we'll probably know soon enough. With the high likelihood of him dying night 2, especially if he agrees to shoot within a pool that town suggests, we're safe keeping him alive (ESPECIALLY if we nail scum today).<br><br>I'm going to talk about the rest of day 1 (including my reads) in another post because it will probably come out to be fairly long."}

Analysis will follow.<br><br>Alright so day 1 was kind of a mess. Things seemed to happen in stages. The early part of day 1 is what I think of as the \"inactives phase\". This spanned for quite a few pages where just under half the player list was either lurking or not in the game at all.<br><br>My Milked Eek's first content post was on page 22.<br>T S O's first content post arguably didn't happen, and LolWagons didn't replace until page 17.<br>Quadraxis/Wake's first content post was page 20.<br>Orestes posted minimal content, but the last of it was page 4, and TSB didn't get in here until page 19.<br>Kid A's first post worth reading was on page 19.<br>TvK, while occasionally throwing in content here and there, was largely a non-factor of much of this early game as well.<br><br>The result of this was a massive stall in the game and SEVERE lack of solid votes until a point where most day 1 phases had already ended with a lynch.<br><br>There was, however, a large amount of town hunting done during this point in time, so it wasn't all wasted. I, as well as several others, established strong town reads that could lead this town to a solid victor.<br><br>The end of the day, however, was <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">a dirty disgusting mess</span>, that could have been solidly avoided had I not been the only person being mindful of the deadline. I certainly hope now everyone has a better understanding of my significant distaste for waiting until deadline to make a move. Seriously guys, we got 2 claims and a self hammer from that mess.<br><br>I stand by the fact that there was scum hiding by in the shadows with useless votes letting town tear themselves apart as we got closer and closer to deadline. Taking a look at vote counts starting around <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5470666#p5470666\" class=\"postlink\">number 18</a> or so will give us lots of information regarding that. We see here TvK the first on TSB's eventual wagon. Street, Lol, and Reg all had early positions on fitz's wagon, with Herself as an honorable mention having thrown early suspicion towards fitz. Herself and SG were the early adopters of the MME wagon, with me probably being the strongest proponent of that lynch later on (save maybe for Herself), and then MME being the solo early push on the Garmr wagon. Wake held his vote for an excessively long time (I'll talk about this later), but the REAL stand out vote here <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">that holds for a really really long time</span> is Kid A's vote on Street.<br><br>Now this vote on street is super significant. Firstly, it was <span style=\"font-style: italic\">useless</span>. He may as well have been not voting. Street had a basically zero chance of being the lynch, and on top of that Kid A had absolutely TRASH reasons for his vote being there. Seriously, look in his ISO. He places his vote <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5464650#p5464650\" class=\"postlink\">here</a> and gives literally no reason for it. He says he'll give a reason later \"assuming he still likes it\". This gives himself a HUGE out should there be backlash for him placing a vote there. Finally <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5464748#p5464748\" class=\"postlink\">here</a>, Kid A gives his reason for that vote on Street. I would like to mention here that the vote came on page 19 where the (shitty) reason for voting occurred on page 3.<br><br>Combine this with the fact that Kid A doesn't move his vote until <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5476421#p5476421\" class=\"postlink\">here</a> <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">where Kid A scum slips</span>. He states that scum is \"seemingly pretty well powered\", when as town he could not possibly have this information, as none of us knew about ANYTHING besides the day talk, which could be scum's only power for all we know. This suspicion of Herself came out of nowhere, and looked like he was hoping to get some traction here as there had been some talk of Herself being suspicious.<br><br>I'm not forgetting his <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5461570#p5461570\" class=\"postlink\">extremely scummy beetlejuice act</a>.<br><br>His final nail in the coffin is his <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5476469#p5476469\" class=\"postlink\">eventual joining of the TSB wagon</a> that was probably the worst vote there. The justification for the vote is the scummiest part. Instead of flat out saying \"I'm voting a null read because town is going to mislynch otherwise\", Kid A tries to give (more shitty) reasons why his vote is where it is.<br><br>I'm not even a little bit of a fan of his instant dropping vote on fitz, either. Actually this reminds me, I was slightly wrong in my previous post about no one wanting to speed lynch fitz, Kid A being scum would suggest that scum might have even no-killed to frame him then speed lynch him.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote Kid A</span>.

Ffery, Slaxx, and Reg all look fairly town to me for solidly pushing fitz for a long time and being confident in their read on him.

TvK shot over to Garmr when shit hit the fan (which gives rise to the theory of a possible TvK/MME pairing). I don't at all like how TvK was the only vote on Bard for so long considering this. Especially considering his <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5468220#p5468220\" class=\"postlink\">reads list here</a>, he clearly wanted TSB to be the day 1 lynch.

I don't like the wording in a lot of his suspicions, things along the lines of \"You seem like a great guy but I'm starting to scum read you\", etc, trying to keep people off his back. Also a lot of his questions were either recently answered by posts the questioned player had just posted or the answers should have been obvious (a good example would be his questions to MME in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5472737#p5472737\" class=\"postlink\">this post</a>, though the same post contains great questions directed to TvK and fitz).<br><br>With solid scum reads in Kid A and TvK, however, I think I'd like to hold off on any Wake suspicion for now, especially since a majority of his content does indeed seem to be town motivated.

It's really bad play. Not only were we robbed of what could have been crucial hours of time, but someone else could have had the chance to hammer you. Furthermore, there was the very slight possibility that you may not have been lynched at all; although, I did plan to hammer someone once they reached L-1 in order to prevent a no-lynch. Your last post betrayed your seemingly cool head, and I would hope that in the future you'd fight the good fight tooth and nail instead of willingly putting the noose around your neck. I get that it's frustrating, I really do, but self-voting isn't justified. If you continue doing this, no one will want to play with you.<br><br>Now, on to business.<br><br>We're in a 13-player game. How likely is it that we're dealing with a 3-member Scumgroup with Daytalk? I think it's unlikely, and that instead we're up against a 2-man team. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Or, we're dealing with 3 Scum + Daytalk... + a few more Town PRs?</span><br><br>Fitz, yesterday you said you were an Odd-Night Vigilante. You claimed Herself's death, and only one person died last Night. How so? Do you think you could have been protected last Night, or that someone blocked Mafia? That would have had to have been the case, otherwise your claim is a downright lie. Why exactly, in your own words, did you decide to shoot Herself? ...and no, I'm afraid it wasn't pretty obvious that Herself was in your target pool. If Bard hadn't robbed us of time we may have gotten around to discussing your target. Undoubtedly there were reservations about your claim which may in part explain people's reluctance to discuss it, and as for the Masons it's extremely unlikely they'd have the inclination to poke their heads out of the earth and reveal themselves to the world of their own volition. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">What I can't seem to understand is why you didn't take your claim and ergo role more seriously, and didn't take the initiative to broach the subject of your target yourself while you had so much time to do so.</span> As Scum you likely felt you didn't have to, or need to. If I were the Vig, and found myself outed, I'd waste no effort in discussing the matters of the pool. You somehow lacked the initiative and the fire in your belly because it is you, Fitz, who is suspicious. <br><br>Because I may be wrong, if a Town PR did prevent Mafia from killing Fitz or anyone else (or protected him), I would suggest waiting with your claim. Please don't risk crumbing it, either, as Scum have Daytalk and can more easily coordinate their thoughts and actions. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Also, I can understand Kid A's (882), because on one hand he mentions that Fitz didn't get a chance to say who he considered shooting, yet one the other he earlier mentions that he'd rather leave Scum guessing, while giving no confirmation that he'd for sure use a 2-3 player target pool.</span> Kid A, while I understand you I don't think that discrepancy reaches the level of being an outright lie. Fitz, please educate us all on how anyone who thought you weren't shooting anyone other than Herself and Garmr wasn't reading the game. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">You said you might have a 2-3 player target pool, yet insinuate that people who didn't for sure know it was either Herself or Garmr were ignorant. You never made your targets obvious, and you squandered the time you had to discuss your targets.</span> Although I don't think you've explicitly lied to me, my trust in you is shaken, Fitz. At the moment I have you in my Scum pile.<br><br>While I do like your smooth demeanor, Fferyllt, I can't help but be a tad troubled by how calm and assertive your posts appear. I don't believe in policy lynches, I don't buy Fitz's claim, he needs to discuss a target pool sooner rather than later, and you're as calm and unassuming as I am when Scum. Strangely, post (888) feels like I'm looking into the mirror when Scum... I will have to pay you more mind as well.<br><br>Garmr, please don't even attempt discussing who Herself's Mason partner is. Only Scum has a vested interest in discovering who the other Mason is, so if you're actually Town you should really cease and desist lest you find yourself swinging from a rope. And now I'm a little angry with you after reading through your (889), because on one hand you imply(?) you're going to keep your mouth shut about SG, and yet you keep opening it in this post. Please, stop it. Knock it off. Town has no reason to be hunting Masons, Doc, Cops, or any other Town PR. And if they DO find them, keep it under wraps for as long as possible. You've been bumped down into my leaning-Scum pile, and you're likely to stay there unless you can somehow redeem yourself in the future. I know it sounds harsh, but you seem to be hunting Town PRs for Scum, and you don't do that as Town.<br><br>Squirrel Girl has been gone for some time. She may be replaced. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">I don't buy her being obvTown based on the way she behaved earlier.</span><br><br>As for Regfan, I'm currently trying to decide where to put him. He talks big and contributes a lot as well. Unlike Regfan Herself wasn't my biggest Townread, and I was surprised she flipped Town. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Reg, please share with us which players should have been vigged according to you, and why.</span> And you know better than to call people retards or other personal insults. As for setup speculation I'm not really sure when it comes to roles. Although, there may be modified ones outside of your typical Doc or mason, right? <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Also Reg, you know you can bounce your thoughts and reads off of me, so I'd appreciate you doing so with me as well.</span> You may be shot tonight, but you shouldn't be too sure that it's either you or Fferyllt. And pleading with the Mafia, like wanting them to shoot someone else, is a typical part of deceitful Scumplay. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">More to the point, I wonder how and why you've \"nearly 100% ruled out\" Street, ICE, and Squirrel.</span> Though you've \"put me aside for now\" because of my efforts and \"interrogation techniques,\" I do hope you'll engage with me with both your thoughts and reads. While I don't particularly mind your focus on Eek, in no way are you nearly 100% cleared, as you so casually assumed with those aforementioned three.<br><br>In my profession as Scum I've usually found ways to \"take responsibility\" for things, because it has the effect of soothing distrust while attracting trust. This is why I don't really like Fferyllt's (893), because it looks a bit that way. It may be genuine, but this is the third post in a row of hers that raises a little red flag in the barren recesses of my mind. Both ICEninja and you haven't left my radar, so I'll be observing both of you to decide whether your developing discussion is ruse or real. <br><br>Two or three more times the mention of re-reading has been rung. I've just checked and SG is V/LA until the 26th. ICEninja, Regfan, and Fferyllt stick out in my mind as Scum, with Havingfitz and Garmr as a distant fourth and fifth, so it all boils down to analyzing with care and every one of their reactions. MME's and Lol's absence is starting to irk me, too.<br><br>About TvK it feels like he's semi-lurking, because he's the only player I keep forgetting is in this game. He'll post a little blurb here and there occasionally, but it does little to give his slot any weight or credibility, because he's not contributing enough and could be seen as Scummy by others. He makes these cute and tiny statements bundled up in a nice little package, but where's the beef? The meat? The substance to it?<br><br>ICEninja, there's good reason to suspect you. Strangely, it feels as though Regfan and Garmr aren't all that interested in inspecting his slot in spite of his shifty demeanor the Day before (so, there could be 3 Scum). You, ICE, knew what you were doing when you voted Bard, and it's because you expected me to hammer player \"X\" at L-1. You wanted to get rid of him, didn't you? In spite of not being assuaged by his guilt you voted for him anyways, which drops you down into my Scumpile as well. Your paranoia and frustration feels more than a little forced, your opportunism dictates your ever-changing votes, and your reasons come all-too-conveniently to support each and every one of your dubious insinuations. This is a gut feeling as well.<br><br>Do you know what's really weird? Kid A's reaction to my vote on him Day 1. <br><br>Fferyllt, was it you who said Fitz would be in your top Town Tier provided he gave kill confirmation? If so, how does that reconcile with your newfound uncertainty on policy-lynching him? He confirmed his kill, yet you don't seem to have him in your top tier as you mentioned earlier. Why?<br><br>Is Lolwagons and Eek still in this game? Lol, Eek, TvK, and presumably SG need to stop lurking, because it's hurting both Town and the game. If you can't properly commit to this, and you do car about Town's survival, then please replace out. <br><br>...and lo and behold, ICEninja is shifting while searching for reasons to dump suspicion on others. Your ever-shifting stance towards everyone (including myself) is apparent. Strangely he continues to repeat the same empty diatribe about my questions not helping Town, in spite of the fact that they do help. Town's got no reason to cling to fallacies, and he's been given more than enough time to reconcile the error in his comments. Oddly enough he contradicts himself in (903) by stating Regfan, Fferyllt, and SG are in his \"will not lynch\" pile, yet at the end of his post has them as \"probably not Scum.\" He should also explain why SG is even on there. Perhaps I'm stretching a tad on this one, or maybe not. What I do know is that I'm going to cast my vote against him and see how people react.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: ICEninja</span>"}

I mostly do that to remind myself of connections. I'll often make statements such as \"I'll remember this connection when x player flips as it will have y impact on z player\" so when I go back and re-read the game later I'll find that. Most of my preferred lynched past day 1 are weighed largely by interactions and vote counts, and sometimes I get things in one read-through that I miss in future ones, and some things I get in future read-throughs that I missed the first time around. It's extra tricky to do this with day talk, however, so these statements will probably hold slightly less weight than they do in most of my games....\"</span><br><br><span style=\"color: #0040FF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">005)\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2739</span></span> How exactly did Kid A increase on your Scum list significantly?<br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic\">\"...He was lurking heavily, someone asked where he was, and he replied with one word less than 10 minutes after said statement.

With the current information we have I'm running with the assumption that there are 3 scum, though it is generally too early in the game to really consider that information to use regrading scum hunting. My scum game where I had day talk had 2 scum, one Godfather and one role blocker. I'm guessing that isn't the current setup in this game, however, as we already have a claimed vig and flipped mason. The lack of investigative roles would lead to a lack of meaningful godfather, suggesting a PROBABLY 3 man scum team. Unless fitz is scum and we have a cop after all, so it is entirely possible. I'm try to not rule anything out at this point.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Wake wrote:</cite>You, ICE, knew what you were doing when you voted Bard, and it's because you expected me to hammer player \"X\" at L-1. You wanted to get rid of him, didn't you? In spite of not being assuaged by his guilt you voted for him anyways, which drops you down into my Scumpile as well.<br></div></blockquote><br>I made it very clear who my preferred lynches were. None of them were viable lynch options. We were approaching deadline dangerously, and letting town no-lynch could have been disastrous. I also find it odd that you accused me of being scummy because I voted a player whom I was not convinced was guilty, yet you not only explained your intent to do so during day 1, have admitted you would have done it after the fact. A quick look through the end of your day 1 play doesn't show you having ANY suspicion of Bard. Care to explain this?<br><br>I'm not saying town necessarily would have let the no-lynch happen had I not voted, but I wasn't willing to take the risk. I put 2 players to L-1 whom I didn't want to, and that's just because town ran shit right up to deadline despite my repeated requests to avoid doing that.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Wake wrote:</cite>ICEninja, Regfan, and Fferyllt stick out in my mind as Scum, with Havingfitz and Garmr as a distant fourth and fifth, so it all boils down to analyzing with care and every one of their reactions.

This is odd, considering a majority of players have multiple strong town reads. Kid A isn't even mentioned here, yet he's easily the scummiest player here. You also had your vote on him for a short while during the end of day 1 yet you've not put him even as your distant 4th or 5th scummiest. Care to reconcile this as well?<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Wake wrote:</cite>ICEninja is shifting while searching for reasons to dump suspicion on others. Your ever-shifting stance towards everyone (including myself) is apparent.<br></div></blockquote><br>Please point out these ever shifting stances. I've had a difficult time reading you all game, as you've been a various shade of null pretty much the entire time you've been here. Kid A has been on my scum list for quite some time, and I've never town read TvK. No one in my town pile is new.

I've also noted that some of your questions are indeed town motivated. I'm getting tired of this misrepresentation.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Wake wrote:</cite>Oddly enough he contradicts himself in (903) by stating Regfan, Fferyllt, and SG are in his \"will not lynch\" pile, yet at the end of his post has them as \"probably not Scum.\"<br></div></blockquote><br>Those players you just listed are all probably not scum. Therefore I am unwilling to lynch them today. Please explain how this is a contradiction.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Wake wrote:</cite>He should also explain why SG is even on there.<br></div></blockquote><br>Her push on Milked Eek looked town. I'm not a fan of how much she simply disappeared towards the end of the day, but just reading through her posts I just find a general town motivation. It isn't really worth my time to go in to detail as to why unless there is a large wagon developing on her, which I don't see happening.<br><br>Since I have so many questions for you I'm going to list them in a nice order so you can go ahead and answer all of them.<br>1) Why am I scummy for voting Bard, whose guilt seemed unconvincing, when you made it clear both <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5476402#p5476402\" class=\"postlink\">before</a> and <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5482701#p5482701\" class=\"postlink\">after</a> that you had intentions to hammer the exact same player, despite a significant lack of any mention of suspicion of the player?<br>2) What are your thoughts on all of Kid A's votes during day 1?<br>3) You had your vote on Kid A for a short time towards the end of day 1, and have expressed suspicion of him in your post, yet you don't even have him listed as your distant 4th or 5th most suspicious.

You just occasionally drop in to ask another ton of questions, followed by another huge post with the strangest reads in this game. The same goes for the end of last dazy. It was quite obvious that either Bard or Garmr was going to be the lynch, but then you just enter and vote Kid A (which also was your first vote all game long)... Ok, I can see why you think he's scummy, but how was Kid A ever going to be the one lynched at the end of the day? You have no involved yourself even once in the forming of the wagons. You haven't even told us once who you actually found most likely to be scum (of those people that had votes on them). And now you just waltz back in with yet again a set of new questions and a post which says ICE (almost a universal townread) is your top scumread, followed by Ffery and Regfan (once again, universal townreads). What about Kid A? You know, that player you wanted to see lynched yesterday."}

Here's an exercise - ignoring what he said Day 2, since at this point my case on him has been around and he's working against it, can you describe to me his reads on Day 1? Also, with whatever you are able to come up with, pay attention to which reads you can learn *prior* to me making the accusation that he was empty posting. It's not exactly a landslide of info, in fact I'd dare say it's non-existent. Also, even since then, though he has proffered up a few reads, he's still not actually advancing ideas of much revelation when compared to the size of his posting. He is slewing up walls of info while saying darn near nothing, and even what he does say is not very strongly stated. I think there is clear scum motive in posting walls while saying nothing, and I think the easy pass so many people were giving him prior to me calling him on it is pretty much the prime example. Can you provide evidence of Day 1 contribution outside of questions, and do you see that evidence as worthy of a town read?<br><br>Also, and let's be frank here, how many of his questions do you think are valid? I forget who suggested that the answers had already been given to some of them, but I really agree with whoever said that. He is just spewing up questions without real context - which pretty much invalidates the ability of the questions to even be justified as serving a purpose. He's literally no more helpful at scumhunting than a ChatBot programmed to randomly ask questions based off key words in this topic would be. Can you explain why you think I'm crazy on that point?"}

This, I think maybe comes down to a play-style thing.  Playing solo I tend to get snooty when asked questions I'm not yet ready to answer out loud because I'm still scumhunting.  In this instance, I was defending Empire's line of questioning and wasn't going to reveal any more of what he was up to than he had already said in-thread.

I wasn't trying to sound town, and in fact knew that I might sound not-town to players who aren't familiar with me, and figured now is as good a time as any to become familiar with my play style.

You're making a declarative statement that I've been working against it.

Decidedly, it's false. Why? Here are some reasons.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">1)</span> We learned in (728 [Wed Nov 20, 2013 4:24 pm]) that TvK hasn't been contributing much because it's part of his playstyle. It also became known to all that his read of me at that time was completely null; he recognized that I provided a lot of information from tons of questions, but he expressed his desire to see me do something with all of the information I've accrued. Lastly in that same singular post he mentioned that Fitz is leaning Scum, but that both Garmr and Bard are his biggest Scumreads. At the present we now know Bard was actually Town. TvK had remained on the Garmr wagon.<br><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">2)</span> We learned in (727 [Wed Nov 20, 2013 4:23 pm]) from Havingfitz that he preferred Herself to Garmr as the better vote. At end of Day 1 he was on Garmr wagon. We now know that Herself was Town. He felt his vote would be wasted on a Herself wagon, so he chose Garmr. He also offers some information as to why he chose Herself over Garmr. In response to another question he mentions that he suspected LolWagon based on T S O\u2019s play and on his efforts against him. Also, \"Call it OMGUS\u2026I\u2019m fine with that\u2026but when I am town I consider anything that calls my alignment into question to be suspect.\" Here we learn that Havingfitz (when Town) considers anyone who questions his alignment suspicious. He goes into more depth on Lol in post (678). To the last question, he didn't realize he was being uncivil. This was moreso my attempt at trying to allay Town strife, because A Town with cooler heads likely survives longer than a Town of hot-heads.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">3)</span> We learned in (724 [Wed Nov 20, 2013 3:46 pm]) that if there was someone here who was shifty, twisted words, and misrepresented people... Garmr thought it'd be Eek. He mentions that he doesn't understand the pros and cons of why I ask people questions in Mafia. Q3, like with Fitz, was meant to stymie contention. Lastly, we learned from Garmr that he 100% believes Eek is Scum, and that his potential slips, misreps, and just outright ignorance is some evidence of that. We now know that in spite of that 100% feeling he voted and lynched Bard, who was Town.<br><br>...this is just a tiny fraction of the questions I've asked. It doesn't take into account the current thoughts and feelings in my substantial posts. If that is an issue for you SG, I don't think I can help you with that.<br><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5485039#p5485039\" class=\"postlink\">post 939</a>, Squirrel Girl wrote:</cite> Also, even since then, though he has proffered up a few reads, he's still not actually advancing ideas of much revelation when compared to the size of his posting.</div></blockquote> <br><br>Please be accurate if you're going to make claims of truth.

Much as Garmr doesn't denounce your questions as invalid, I don't denounce yours as invalid either. Because the universe doesn't revolve around you, it's not up to you to decide which questions are valid. All that matters is that they're answered, and everyone is illuminated by the knowledge that is gained.

When the questions is asked to them, it should be answered. People shouldn't have to guess and assume what people mean, and it's dishonest to deflect and flee from questions while pointing at one's ISO while screaming \"It's there!

You, however, knew Bard wasn't that convincing as a Scum read. You knew full well: \"This sucks though, this will be my second time putting a player I'm not convinced is scum at L-1.

I don't mind his early vote on you, and as for Fitz and Street Hassle I don't know. See, I differ from Kid A because I don't like changing my votes so much, or voting a lot. Scarcity creates value.

I've contributed a <span style=\"font-style: italic\">lot</span>, here, and that doesn't even include all of the information gathered from my questions. Instead, you two just look at all I've done to help, and you dismiss it as crap. If I were a lesser person I'd simply say \"Fuck you\" and start getting mean. Instead, I need to stay calm, take the high road, remain fair and honest, and put distance between me and the people who aren't willing to be fair with me. Whether you are Town or Scum, what you've done is bad for Town, because you've dismissed information-gathering as bad while being incredibly partial and dismissive. <br><br>So, I'm not going to call you names. I'm not going to attack either of you personally. I will, however, ignore you for a while because further engagement with these unfair arguments of yours is not going to help Town, and is only bound to cause more discord. I do have reads in my ISO, as well as opinions, thoughts, and stances. You two are ignorant of that. Town, I'll make sure to start providing individual reads posts, since apparently my numerous reads aren't being read by some in my posts. I understand I can completely refute SG's nonsense about my posts containing absolutely nothing, but I don't have the energy to combat such ignorance on not one but two fronts, and the possibility of losing my cool and by extension hurting Town is too great a risk. Right now I'm planning to continue using my Annihilator Beam to ask questions, because regardless of what's said it's nothing but net gain for Town. I also plan to continue with my substantial stream-of-thought posts, because, you know, that's what I like doing. Also, I'll be including posts singularly devoted to reads, and I'll even post it in bold so that it's not missed."}

Here are some reasons.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">1)</span> We learned in (728 [Wed Nov 20, 2013 4:24 pm]) that TvK hasn't been contributing much because it's part of his playstyle. It also became known to all that his read of me at that time was completely null; he recognized that I provided a lot of information from tons of questions, but he expressed his desire to see me do something with all of the information I've accrued. Lastly in that same singular post he mentioned that Fitz is leaning Scum, but that both Garmr and Bard are his biggest Scumreads. At the present we now know Bard was actually Town. TvK had remained on the Garmr wagon.<br><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">2)</span> We learned in (727 [Wed Nov 20, 2013 4:23 pm]) from Havingfitz that he preferred Herself to Garmr as the better vote. At end of Day 1 he was on Garmr wagon. We now know that Herself was Town. He felt his vote would be wasted on a Herself wagon, so he chose Garmr. He also offers some information as to why he chose Herself over Garmr. In response to another question he mentions that he suspected LolWagon based on T S O\u2019s play and on his efforts against him. Also, \"Call it OMGUS\u2026I\u2019m fine with that\u2026but when I am town I consider anything that calls my alignment into question to be suspect.\" Here we learn that Havingfitz (when Town) considers anyone who questions his alignment suspicious. He goes into more depth on Lol in post (678). To the last question, he didn't realize he was being uncivil. This was moreso my attempt at trying to allay Town strife, because A Town with cooler heads likely survives longer than a Town of hot-heads.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">3)</span> We learned in (724 [Wed Nov 20, 2013 3:46 pm]) that if there was someone here who was shifty, twisted words, and misrepresented people... Garmr thought it'd be Eek. He mentions that he doesn't understand the pros and cons of why I ask people questions in Mafia. Q3, like with Fitz, was meant to stymie contention. Lastly, we learned from Garmr that he 100% believes Eek is Scum, and that his potential slips, misreps, and just outright ignorance is some evidence of that. We now know that in spite of that 100% feeling he voted and lynched Bard, who was Town.<br><br>...this is just a tiny fraction of the questions I've asked.

It's really bad play. Not only were we robbed of what could have been crucial hours of time, but someone else could have had the chance to hammer you. Furthermore, there was the very slight possibility that you may not have been lynched at all; although, I did plan to hammer someone once they reached L-1 in order to prevent a no-lynch. Your last post betrayed your seemingly cool head, and I would hope that in the future you'd fight the good fight tooth and nail instead of willingly putting the noose around your neck. I get that it's frustrating, I really do, but self-voting isn't justified. If you continue doing this, no one will want to play with you. <span style=\"color: #004080\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Here, I was upset with TSB self-voting and robbing us of information and time.</span></span><br><br>Now, on to business.<br><br>We're in a 13-player game. How likely is it that we're dealing with a 3-member Scumgroup with Daytalk? I think it's unlikely, and that instead we're up against a 2-man team. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Or, we're dealing with 3 Scum + Daytalk... + a few more Town PRs?</span> <span style=\"color: #004080\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Here I'm wondering about the setup, and now I've been beginning to think it's a 3-man team, and that that there ought to be some sort of additional PRs to balance out the Daytalk.</span></span><br><br>Fitz, yesterday you said you were an Odd-Night Vigilante. You claimed Herself's death, and only one person died last Night. How so? <span style=\"color: #004080\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">I'm wondering about Fitz's actions last Night.</span></span> Do you think you could have been protected last Night, or that someone blocked Mafia? <span style=\"color: #004080\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Here, too.</span></span> That would have had to have been the case, otherwise your claim is a downright lie. <span style=\"color: #0040BF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">I'm processing the possibilities.</span></span> Why exactly, in your own words, did you decide to shoot Herself? <span style=\"color: #004080\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Another question.</span></span> ...and no, I'm afraid it wasn't pretty obvious that Herself was in your target pool. <span style=\"color: #004080\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">My implication is that he hadn't made it obvious.</span></span> If Bard hadn't robbed us of time we may have gotten around to discussing your target. Undoubtedly there were reservations about your claim which may in part explain people's reluctance to discuss it, and as for the Masons it's extremely unlikely they'd have the inclination to poke their heads out of the earth and reveal themselves to the world of their own volition. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">What I can't seem to understand is why you didn't take your claim and ergo role more seriously, and didn't take the initiative to broach the subject of your target yourself while you had so much time to do so.</span> <span style=\"color: #004080\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">I felt this sentence was particularly strong, because it's a question that asked why, as claimed Vig, did he not more passionately try and discuss who he should kill. If I were Vig he got to kill tonight, I'd make a real effort to get the discussion going.</span></span> As Scum you likely felt you didn't have to, or need to. If I were the Vig, and found myself outed, I'd waste no effort in discussing the matters of the pool. You somehow lacked the initiative and the fire in your belly because it is you, Fitz, who is suspicious. <span style=\"color: #004080\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">With this I add some pressure.</span></span><br><br>Because I may be wrong, if a Town PR did prevent Mafia from killing Fitz or anyone else (or protected him), I would suggest waiting with your claim. Please don't risk crumbing it, either, as Scum have Daytalk and can more easily coordinate their thoughts and actions. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Also, I can understand Kid A's (882), because on one hand he mentions that Fitz didn't get a chance to say who he considered shooting, yet one the other he earlier mentions that he'd rather leave Scum guessing, while giving no confirmation that he'd for sure use a 2-3 player target pool.</span> <span style=\"color: #004080\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">I can understand his sentiments.</span></span> Kid A, while I understand you I don't think that discrepancy reaches the level of being an outright lie. <span style=\"color: #004080\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">But I don't think it's an outright lie.</span></span> Fitz, please educate us all on how anyone who thought you weren't shooting anyone other than Herself and Garmr wasn't reading the game. <span style=\"color: #004080\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">I'm asking him to explain himself, and yet you think this is part of the nothingness I've offered, SG.</span></span> <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">You said you might have a 2-3 player target pool, yet insinuate that people who didn't for sure know it was either Herself or Garmr were ignorant. You never made your targets obvious, and you squandered the time you had to discuss your targets.</span> Although I don't think you've explicitly lied to me, my trust in you is shaken, Fitz. At the moment I have you in my Scum pile. <span style=\"color: #004080\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">This is one of my non-existing reads.</span></span><br><br>While I do like your smooth demeanor, Fferyllt, I can't help but be a tad troubled by how calm and assertive your posts appear. <span style=\"color: #004080\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Here I have some reservations about Fferyllt, because of her demeanor. You can consider it a read.</span></span> I don't believe in policy lynches, I don't buy Fitz's claim, he needs to discuss a target pool sooner rather than later, and you're as calm and unassuming as I am when Scum. Strangely, post (888) feels like I'm looking into the mirror when Scum... I will have to pay you more mind as well. <span style=\"color: #004080\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Here, too, I mention keeping more of an eye on her (which is tough because you keep badgering me about saying nothing when I haven't. </span></span><br><br>Garmr, please don't even attempt discussing who Herself's Mason partner is. Only Scum has a vested interest in discovering who the other Mason is, so if you're actually Town you should really cease and desist lest you find yourself swinging from a rope. And now I'm a little angry with you after reading through your (889), because on one hand you imply(?) you're going to keep your mouth shut about SG, and yet you keep opening it in this post. Please, stop it. Knock it off. Town has no reason to be hunting Masons, Doc, Cops, or any other Town PR. And if they DO find them, keep it under wraps for as long as possible. <span style=\"color: #004080\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Here I'm rather angry over him discussing Herself's partner.</span></span> You've been bumped down into my leaning-Scum pile, and you're likely to stay there unless you can somehow redeem yourself in the future. <span style=\"color: #004080\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Again, a non-existing read, huh?</span></span> I know it sounds harsh, but you seem to be hunting Town PRs for Scum, and you don't do that as Town.<br><br>Squirrel Girl has been gone for some time. She may be replaced. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">I don't buy her being obvTown based on the way she behaved earlier.</span> <span style=\"color: #004080\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Another implied read.</span></span><br><br>As for Regfan, I'm currently trying to decide where to put him. He talks big and contributes a lot as well. Unlike Regfan Herself wasn't my biggest Townread, and I was surprised she flipped Town. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Reg, please share with us which players should have been vigged according to you, and why.</span> <span style=\"color: #004080\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Another important question.</span></span> And you know better than to call people retards or other personal insults. As for setup speculation I'm not really sure when it comes to roles. Although, there may be modified ones outside of your typical Doc or mason, right? <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Also Reg, you know you can bounce your thoughts and reads off of me, so I'd appreciate you doing so with me as well.</span> You may be shot tonight, but you shouldn't be too sure that it's either you or Fferyllt. <span style=\"color: #004080\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Opinion.</span></span> And pleading with the Mafia, like wanting them to shoot someone else, is a typical part of deceitful Scumplay. <span style=\"color: #004080\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Opinion.</span></span> <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">More to the point, I wonder how and why you've \"nearly 100% ruled out\" Street, ICE, and Squirrel.</span> <span style=\"color: #004080\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Another implied question.</span></span> Though you've \"put me aside for now\" because of my efforts and \"interrogation techniques,\" I do hope you'll engage with me with both your thoughts and reads. While I don't particularly mind your focus on Eek, in no way are you nearly 100% cleared, as you so casually assumed with those aforementioned three.<br><br>In my profession as Scum I've usually found ways to \"take responsibility\" for things, because it has the effect of soothing distrust while attracting trust. This is why I don't really like Fferyllt's (893), because it looks a bit that way. <span style=\"color: #004080\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Opinion/read here.</span></span> It may be genuine, but this is the third post in a row of hers that raises a little red flag in the barren recesses of my mind. <span style=\"color: #004080\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Another opinion/read.</span></span> Both ICEninja and you haven't left my radar, so I'll be observing both of you to decide whether your developing discussion is ruse or real. <br><br>Two or three more times the mention of re-reading has been rung. I've just checked and SG is V/LA until the 26th. ICEninja, Regfan, and Fferyllt stick out in my mind as Scum, with Havingfitz and Garmr as a distant fourth and fifth, so it all boils down to analyzing with care and every one of their reactions. MME's and Lol's absence is starting to irk me, too.<br><br>About TvK it feels like he's semi-lurking, because he's the only player I keep forgetting is in this game. <span style=\"color: #004080\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Yet another opinion/stance you say doesn't exist.</span></span> He'll post a little blurb here and there occasionally, but it does little to give his slot any weight or credibility, because he's not contributing enough and could be seen as Scummy by others. He makes these cute and tiny statements bundled up in a nice little package, but where's the beef? The meat? The substance to it? <span style=\"color: #004080\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">More reads on his behavior.</span></span><br><br>ICEninja, there's good reason to suspect you. Strangely, it feels as though Regfan and Garmr aren't all that interested in inspecting his slot in spite of his shifty demeanor the Day before (so, there could be 3 Scum). <span style=\"color: #004080\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Another implied question.</span></span> You, ICE, knew what you were doing when you voted Bard, and it's because you expected me to hammer player \"X\" at L-1. <span style=\"color: #004080\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Another implication.</span></span> You wanted to get rid of him, didn't you? <span style=\"color: #004080\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Question/pressure.</span></span> In spite of not being assuaged by his guilt you voted for him anyways, which drops you down into my Scumpile as well. <span style=\"color: #004080\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Another non-existing read.</span></span> Your paranoia and frustration feels more than a little forced, your opportunism dictates your ever-changing votes, and your reasons come all-too-conveniently to support each and every one of your dubious insinuations. This is a gut feeling as well. <span style=\"color: #004080\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Another read/gut feeling.</span></span><br><br>Do you know what's really weird? Kid A's reaction to my vote on him Day 1. <span style=\"color: #004080\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Noting that Kid A completely ignored my vote on him.</span></span><br><br>Fferyllt, was it you who said Fitz would be in your top Town Tier provided he gave kill confirmation? If so, how does that reconcile with your newfound uncertainty on policy-lynching him? He confirmed his kill, yet you don't seem to have him in your top tier as you mentioned earlier. Why? <span style=\"color: #004080\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Valid questions that I wanted answered.</span></span><br><br>Is Lolwagons and Eek still in this game? Lol, Eek, TvK, and presumably SG need to stop lurking, because it's hurting both Town and the game. If you can't properly commit to this, and you do car about Town's survival, then please replace out. <br><br>...and lo and behold, ICEninja is shifting while searching for reasons to dump suspicion on others. Your ever-shifting stance towards everyone (including myself) is apparent. Strangely he continues to repeat the same empty diatribe about my questions not helping Town, in spite of the fact that they do help. Town's got no reason to cling to fallacies, and he's been given more than enough time to reconcile the error in his comments. Oddly enough he contradicts himself in (903) by stating Regfan, Fferyllt, and SG are in his \"will not lynch\" pile, yet at the end of his post has them as \"probably not Scum.\" He should also explain why SG is even on there. Perhaps I'm stretching a tad on this one, or maybe not. What I do know is that I'm going to cast my vote against him and see how people react.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: ICEninja</span> <span style=\"color: #004080\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Here I'm voting the one I think is most suspicious, with reasons.</span></span> </div></blockquote><br><br>You can opine all you want about those thoughts being weak, SG, but stop saying they don't exist, please."}

You're getting excessively emotional about things which is causing your posts to come off probably scummier than they would otherwise.

Well, Fitz went on and shot Herself, Kid A's scumread, remember? And now Fitz is scum? So many inconsistencies.</div></blockquote><br>let me clarify the herself thing for everyone<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">herself seemingly breadcrumbed a pr read and i was trying to figure out why the fuck anyone would do that in a game with daytalk</span><br><br>the herself lynch wasnt happening and herself promised to shed some light on the post in question tomorrow if i joined the big wagon and stopped a no lynch - i really fucking doubt that scum would do anything but dismiss my easily dismissable theory so i dropped it<br><br>the fitz vote was based on one kill and the dissonance between him saying he didnt want to reveal his shot so scum didnt have any clues and him saying that he was going to announce a shotpool<br><br>i think a real vig would have put more thought into a shot so their attitude regarding the shot would probably not change and they definitely wouldnt make those conflicting statements</div></blockquote><br><br>So what we gather from this is kid a noticed a bread crumb of a power role. Yet jumps on to try and lynch herself. I think Kid A picked up on the fact herself was a mason as well. But unlike me it wasn't because he was in the last game with Desp it was because he had inside knowledge. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5476421#p5476421\" class=\"postlink\">post 818</a>, Kid A wrote:</cite>ok crazy theory - mafia team has daytalk but the kill is submitted by a traitor who cant read the conversation (kind of like ground control and then theres one guy in space)<br>also <span class=\"noboldsig\">herself is one of the people with access to the daytalk</span><br><br>this would explain havingfitz having a low powered role when scum were seemingly pretty well powered and explain one of herselfs posts where i think he tried to soft a pr read</div></blockquote><br><br>This is what makes me think he has inside knowledge. He noticed herself's mason role (As bolded) and pushed to lynch. Why would he suggest this crazy theory you ask? Because he is obviously the scum mason and when you have one of those your guaranteed to have a town one 2-3 of them.<br><br>What I can gather from Kid A is scum have a pair of masons and one scum is outside of the mason party who probably has a power role of some kind."}

I'll try and only go into the points I consider to be relatively major; 1) His vote on Garmr read as opportunistic given the timing of it and his <span style=\"font-style: italic\">\"took me long enough to find a good place.\"</span> ignores and contradicts the stance he'd been taking on Orestes in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5457747#p5457747\">Post 280</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5457930#p5457930\">Post 291</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5466662#p5466662\">Post 533</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5468220#p5468220\">Post 564</a>, it comes across as him forgetting or wanting to distance himself from his push on TSB while at the same time jumping on Garmr. 2) His attempt and reasoning in pushing the Garmr is scum conclusion in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5474733#p5474733\">Post 779</a> makes no logical sense whatsoever. 3) His entire day 2 play reads as him standing back and not getting in the middle of anything, his lack of vote especially points towards that, he hasn't mentioned Garmr at all today which is massively off given his read on Garmr yesterday and he states a scum read on Kid A in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5483525#p5483525\">Post 915</a> but refrains from voting him. Really his reads don't match his actions at all and his play today is very much one of dodge the limelight and survive which is scum motivated. <br><br>Also I assume the \"L-1 vote business\" you're talking about is his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5476402#p5476402\">Post 814</a> and while I don't like the \"hammer whoever\" section of it as it implies he's not bothered with a town read being hung the push for a lynch to occur is understandable given that a NL D1 is significantly worse than a rushed lynch.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5487382#p5487382\" class=\"postlink\">post 1015</a>, ICEninja wrote:</cite>This is Reg's 4th time saying \"Kid A did something scummy...but...\" and I don't like it.</div></blockquote><br>I have far more reservations about Kid A being scum than TvK being scum and I think the case on Tvk is significantly stronger (Please read above).

He didn't really like ICE's vote because of a statement pulled out of its context, but he decided to keep his vote on Orestes (TSB) <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5450337#p5450337\" class=\"postlink\">(67)</a>. In <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5451698#p5451698\" class=\"postlink\">(107)</a> he still didn't like Orestes (TSB), yet gave him some more time to expound, because he wanted to hear his reasonings on Banksys (Regfan). He liked the conversation between SG and Street (Fferyllt) on page 5-6, but he didn't approve of SG's conclusion yet viewed Street's (Fferyllt) reasoning as legit <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5454708#p5454708\" class=\"postlink\">(178)</a>. <br><br>In that same post he quoted Herself; Herself said that she had wanted to work with Kid A, Garmr, SG, and Ice Day 1. In response to that he said this: \"Hmm, Kid A? Don't see how he should be in this group. Unless you played with him before...\" He still likes Garmr's way of posting, and Des's too, because it \"had very good content.\" He couldn't read ICE at the moment, especially his last couple of posts where he really focuses on Herself. None of ICE's posts could maybe convince him of Herself's guilt at that point. <br><br>Is still waiting for Oreste's (TSB's) next post <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5454709#p5454709\" class=\"postlink\">(179)</a>. He doesn't like Fitz's post, he calls them a bunch of questions that are presumably already answered; same with Kid A <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5455511#p5455511\" class=\"postlink\">(210)</a>. Also, he had a feeling about MME's wall, too: \"Hmm, I also got a strange vibe from that post. Dunno what to think of it yet...\" He mentions he's had zero Scum games <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5456928#p5456928\" class=\"postlink\">(261)</a>. He then seems to imply that Orestes (TSB), Kid A, TSO, and Fitz he doesn't like because of their low post content (if I am wrong, please correct me).<br><br>Later in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5457747#p5457747\" class=\"postlink\">(280)</a> he gives a moderately thorough read on all players\u2014I'll include some of my thoughts on this in my upcoming reads. He questions SG's vote on Fitz, and he questions her with \"And do you have an idea about someone when you say 'but I feel we can do better?'\"<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5457897#p5457897\" class=\"postlink\">(288)</a>. In response to SG he doesn't want Street (FFeryllt) dead, but Orestes (TSB) definitely so <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5457930#p5457930\" class=\"postlink\">(291)</a>. Nearly 100 posts later he's interested in the MME wagon <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5461550#p5461550\" class=\"postlink\">(383)</a>. Wonders where Kid A went <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5461553#p5461553\" class=\"postlink\">(384)</a>. <br><br>While responding to Garmr he reiterates that he really wants the inactive to start posting <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5461843#p5461843\" class=\"postlink\">(399)</a>. <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5465943#p5465943\" class=\"postlink\">(488)</a> shows him saying \"I don't feel comfortable with calling Wake town after 19 pages of silence and then a couple of decent posts.\" He wonders how Bard's scumpoints are calculated. He also asks Bard \"Do you immediatly call the person with the most scumpoints your top scumread?\" As well as \"Is the total amount of scumpoints relative to factors like total number of posts?,\" \"And do lurkers get just as many scumpoints as posters?,\" and \"If so, where does for example Quadraxis/Wake, who had exactly 1 post before you posted, rank?\"<br><br>Also regarding Bard, in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5466309#p5466309\" class=\"postlink\">(510)</a>, he asks him \"Is it just me or is this absolutely not convincing at all?,\" and then mentions \"Omg your reads suck so I hard, my reads are the only ones that are right?\" He then says \"As far as I understand your reasoning, this seems to me like the core of your case on Herself. I don't know what you are trying here, but in my book your only making yourself look worse.\" to Bard <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5466662#p5466662\" class=\"postlink\">(533)</a>. Again he dismisses Bard with \"Once again, the same BS. What if ICE would walk in right now and vote Street? Or the other way around? Then they would be instascum, right? I love where my vote is at this moment.\" He continues disagreeing with Bard while pressuring him in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5468197#p5468197\" class=\"postlink\">(563)</a>, and we now know Bard was frustrated enough to self-hammer. <br><br>TvK's reads haven't really changed in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5468220#p5468220\" class=\"postlink\">(564)</a>, but he's accused Bard of making cases where they don't exist, while saying Bard's attack against Herself, SG, and TvK feels fabricated. He wanted Bard lynched, followed by Fitz <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5468421#p5468421\" class=\"postlink\">(571)</a>. Appears to be trying to lead Fitz off of Herself's trail: \"The fact you're tunnelling so hard on Herself. Apart from your arguement with them, which is not really going somewhere, I feel like you've not really looked at other players (maybe you have, but all the other players seem like a side note to you at the moment)\" <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5468451#p5468451\" class=\"postlink\">(576)</a>. And in that same post, \"...I don't like it that you find Wake and Eek town, when they only posted a little bit of content on the last couple of pages.\"<br><br>He doesn't like Garmr's heavy reaction when someone calls him(Garmr) Scummy <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5468467#p5468467\" class=\"postlink\">(580)</a>. Still doesn't like Garmr, but feels an MME lynch is unavoidable, and says he'll post more detailed stuff later <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5472002#p5472002\" class=\"postlink\">(664)</a>. He unvotes Bard and votes for Garmr <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5472246#p5472246\" class=\"postlink\">(682)</a>. Also, he responds to my Annihilator Beam shots without much if any complaints <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5472907#p5472907\" class=\"postlink\">(728)</a>. Regarding Kid A he says this: \"Once again he just pops in when someone mentions that he hasn't been posting in a while. I'd love to go after this guy somewhere in day 2\" <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5474646#p5474646\" class=\"postlink\">(773)</a>. <br><br>His Scumreads have changed; Eek started posting more, he went from null to fishy on Garmr, and Fitz looked better with Garmr's increasing fishiness <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5474847#p5474847\" class=\"postlink\">(789)</a>. Post <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5482002#p5482002\" class=\"postlink\">(897)</a> shows that he doesn't like Kid A's sudden vote on Fitz. He asks me when I'm going to get involved, and why I voted for Kid A when there were two seperate big wagons, and mentions that I've not even once been involved in the forming of the wagons <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5482931#p5482931\" class=\"postlink\">(909)</a>. And he also wonders about Kid A, the one I had wanted to lynch Day 1. Kid A is his main Scumread, starting from the end of Day 1 when he started suspecting ICEninja <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5483525#p5483525\" class=\"postlink\">(915)</a>.<br><br>Also, he then points out that Kid A had a very strange theory and had concluded that was Scum, and that Kid had hopped on the Bard wagon without really giving a read on him. In <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5486030#p5486030\" class=\"postlink\">(947)</a> he asks Regfan about my Scumreading Regfan. Thursdays are busy for TvK, and although he's not really convinced I'm Scum he says that if I'm Town my \"attitude really needs to change;\" Kid A's last post also bugs him, and he mentions posting more in detail later <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5487637#p5487637\" class=\"postlink\">(1023)</a>.<br><br></span><br><br>These are my reads on TvK. <br><br>TvK I've had a bit of difficulty pinning down, but, I think I may have figured it out. His opening posts from (17) to (178) reads as null-Town to me; nothing too Scummy or Townish there. He would appear at that moment as a Townie willing to sit back and ask questions, in order to find out what's what. Herself (the Mason) mentioned working with Kid A and three certain others, and TvK mentioned he didn't really see why Kid A should be in that group. It could be that Herself really did want to work with them and TvK was simply giving his benign opinion, or it could be that Herself (as Mason) made it look like she wanted to work with those four and imply one or more of them were Masons, in order for Scum to potentially go after them after her death and subsequent flip. And, perhaps, it could be that TvK is her Mason partner.<br><br>Remember that TvK said that <span style=\"font-style: italic\">nothing</span> ICEninja posted could even <span style=\"font-style: italic\">maybe</span> convince him of Herself's guilt. That was during Day 1, and <span style=\"font-style: italic\">no one</span> besides the Mason knew there were Masons in the game. Only after the fact when Night 1 resolved did we learn of her role. ...so, why was TvK so eager to protect her Day 1? It couldn't be because he's Scum, because Scum didn't know there were Masons, either. He does question and comment on MME, Fitz, Kid A and Orestes. That comes off as being Townish, I guess. What does bother me a bit though is when he mentioned that he's had zero Scum games. I've heard that line from people who were Scum in that game they were in before.<br><br>One problem I'm dealing with it that he wanted Orestes (Bard) dead, and Bard flipped Town. Yet he defended Herself and distracted people from her lynch, and she was a Mason, and no one knew there were Masons Day 1 yet he continued to defend her. He said Bard's attack against Herself felt fabricated. His annoyance with the inactives comes off as Townish, too. Again he defends Herself against Bard in (510). It could be that Bard, TvK, and Herself was an all-Town slapfest. In (280) he has Herself pegged as Town, that he really liked their way of hunting, especially their (155). <br><br>The real kicker is this quote right here: \"The fact you're tunnelling so hard on Herself. Apart from your arguement with them, which is not really going somewhere, I feel like you've not really looked at other players (maybe you have, but all the other players seem like a side note to you at the moment)\" (576).\" Again he's defending Herself and telling off Fitz, trying to get him to look elsewhere. I think TvK is a Mason who tried his best to defend the other Mason Day 1, but somehow Mafia got a whiff of Herself's scent and killed her Night 1, and, I'm guessing, they already plan (or have already planned) to try and kill TvK Night 2. <br><br>I think TvK is a Town Mason, and that Scum have already figured it out before me, and that he is indeed their target tonight. All they need to do is look at who mysteriously kept defending the hidden Mason Day 1 to draw conclusions. I know I chastised Garmr about talking on Town Masons, but this is important and I had the scary realization that if I've figured it out with such little data, Scum with all their advantageous knowledge discerned it far faster than I have. If we have a Doc/protective role in this game, I strongly urge that TvK is defended tonight. TvK, if you're indeed a Town Mason, it doesn't really matter anymore to stay quiet about it. If you're Mason then you should claim right now and lead the town, and if you're lying I suspect we'll find out soon enough should another dead Townie flip Mason.<br><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">So, reviewing all of this, I cannot in good faith support his wagon at this moment. I will not push for his lynch, but defend him from it. If there was a range from 1-10, I'd give him a 9/10. That's how strong I feel about his read at the moment.</span>"}

Only after the fact when Night 1 resolved did we learn of her role. ...so, why was TvK so eager to protect her Day 1? It couldn't be because he's Scum, because Scum didn't know there were Masons, either. He does question and comment on MME, Fitz, Kid A and Orestes. That comes off as being Townish, I guess. What does bother me a bit though is when he mentioned that he's had zero Scum games. I've heard that line from people who were Scum in that game they were in before.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">I'm not the only person that had Herself as one of their top town reads during day 1. And once again, people were asking for my scum-meta, so I was just pointing out that I had no completed scum games.</span><br><br>One problem I'm dealing with it that he wanted Orestes (Bard) dead, and Bard flipped Town. Yet he defended Herself and distracted people from her lynch, and she was a Mason, and no one knew there were Masons Day 1 yet he continued to defend her. He said Bard's attack against Herself felt fabricated. His annoyance with the inactives comes off as Townish, too. Again he defends Herself against Bard in (510). It could be that Bard, TvK, and Herself was an all-Town slapfest. In (280) he has Herself pegged as Town, that he really liked their way of hunting, especially their (155). <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">I don't know where you're getting it that Herself was going to be lynched. All game long, Herself has had only 2 people voting them, Fitz (twice) and Bard, both even at seperate moments. At that moment I had a lot more troubles with the fact that Bard's case felt forced and not that that case happened to be on Herself.</span><br><br>The real kicker is this quote right here: \"The fact you're tunnelling so hard on Herself. Apart from your arguement with them, which is not really going somewhere, I feel like you've not really looked at other players (maybe you have, but all the other players seem like a side note to you at the moment)\" (576).\" Again he's defending Herself and telling off Fitz, trying to get him to look elsewhere. I think TvK is a Mason who tried his best to defend the other Mason Day 1, but somehow Mafia got a whiff of Herself's scent and killed her Night 1, and, I'm guessing, they already plan (or have already planned) to try and kill TvK Night 2. <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">It all fits perfectly in your theory, but I was just pointing out to Fitz why I thought he was scummy. What does intrigue me is that you think that Herself was the scum kill. Does that mean that you think that Fitz is lying? Or that Fitz and the scum both shot Herself. Wouldn't that be quite stupid because it was incredibly obvious that Fitz was going to shoot Herself?</span><br><br>I think TvK is a Town Mason, and that Scum have already figured it out before me, and that he is indeed their target tonight. All they need to do is look at who mysteriously kept defending the hidden Mason Day 1 to draw conclusions. I know I chastised Garmr about talking on Town Masons, but this is important and I had the scary realization that if I've figured it out with such little data, Scum with all their advantageous knowledge discerned it far faster than I have. If we have a Doc/protective role in this game, I strongly urge that TvK is defended tonight. TvK, if you're indeed a Town Mason, it doesn't really matter anymore to stay quiet about it. If you're Mason then you should claim right now and lead the town, and if you're lying I suspect we'll find out soon enough should another dead Townie flip Mason.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">I'll just say it now: I am NOT a Mason. It feels weird to me that I almost automatically seem to be either a mason or scum, no way inbetween. I don't quite know what more to say at this moment...</span><br><br>So, reviewing all of this, I cannot in good faith support his wagon at this moment. I will not push for his lynch, but defend him from it. If there was a range from 1-10, I'd give him a 9/10. That's how strong I feel about his read at the moment.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Well, you now know that you're strong feeling about my read is wrong. What does that make me in your eyes? Does this change your reads on anyone else? Do you plan on going to look for a mason again?</span></div></blockquote>"}

I still didn't think about him as Garmr when I got thrown off by Bard's posts that seemed really scummy to me. But then Garmr asked me some questions in #565, to which I responded in #571. I don't know if you can really notice it in the post itself, but I went in with Garmr as null and when I finished writing it, I had convinced myself that Garmr's play had been fishy all game long.<br><br>Now Fitz comes into the equasion. My scumread on Fitz was a combination of one of my strongest townreads (you) constantly attacking him without him being able to, in my opinion, say something townish.

The worst parts of it though are 1) The name calling \"Fitz\", \"Street\" \"SG\" is something he's blatantly been doing about everyone throughout the game 2) ICE's unvote of Fitz and support of the claim is something a lot of us did, including me ie; Streets <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5474716#p5474716\">Post 778</a>, Herselfs <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5474741#p5474741\">Post 780</a>, Garmrs <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5475260#p5475260\">Post 798</a> and my <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5475371#p5475371\">Post 799</a>. 3) His \"These are the possibilities\" post comes across as him trying to get his thoughts down so that he can work out what's likely and the \"Very likely\" there was Fitz being town so the \"hold back on voting waiting\" doesn't really make sense. 4) ICE stated frustration with a lot of the inactives in the game, he's stated frustration with actives even (Pretty sure the fact that I still aren't convinced you're scum is pissing him off too but I'm much more sure on TvK being scum here despite how bad your case is)."}

Why didn't it ping you then? He might indeed be scum, I still have a number of issues with the slot that, sadly, mostly are 'gut' right now, but I think poor communication of reads is not really a sign of that anymore since he pretty clearly does it to a similar degree when town, making it a difficult alignment tell and instead just more of an anti-town playstyle. At least that's where I'm at with it. I'll agree he hasn't made it easy for you to interact with him as far as his reads go...but I've been doing that dance with him since Day 1, so it's hardly a new thing."}

He never hopped on the Fitz wagon because he was too busy voting Street and Herself (much better choices, yeah). He never said anything about Fitz's claim either. At the end of the day, he just joined the Bard wagon.<br><br>Then day 2 starts and he starts off with immediatly voting Fitz. After all of his crazy-ass theories during day 1 (note that he even speculated about a scum team without a night kill), he apparently was unable to grasp that it still is possible that Fitz is our vig even though only one person died during the night. Enough people have speculated about what happened already. And then he even calls Fitz a liar in #882, but when he notices he's drawing too much attention to himself, he pulls off a classic Kid A, and disappears for a couple of days again.<br><br>His case on ICE is horrible. Also, let's look at all his previous mentions of ICE, and compare it to his \"case\". The first thing he calls him out on is that he mentions the fact that the scum team have daytalk. Well, Kid A had noticed this and used it as a joke reason for his RVS post (#23, I thought his smiley was included to imply that it was a joke). Then, we go a long time without hearing from him, but then in #474, he calls ICE genuine town. And then suddenly in #770, after another three days without him posting, he asks if anyone else is starting to find ICE scummy...<br><br>And then his final posts. Once again, he had disappeared for a couple of days. Then he comes in, says he's not scum, has apparently concluded that ICE and Fitz are scum, makes up a crappy case and just hopes that everyone will follow him.<br><br>So Reg, if it makes you feel more comfortable, I'll vote Kid A;<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Kid A</span>"}

She just seems rather subdued to me. Wasn't in favor of a TvK lynch yesterday, but now she's moving in that direction. I'm not sure what the odds are that both Hydras were Town. She's also been sizing Kid A up for a lynch. I'm not convinced she was temperish, either, as she had mentioned. In (943) she's moreso going after Kid A, which could either be innocent, or Scum trying to be really convincing to pull off a \"reasonable\" mislynch; please pardon my skepticism. Oddly with (1057), I tend to get more lost in huge multi-quote walls rather than solid text walls of 4-5 sentence paragraphs. She does have reservations about taking TvK off the table, and from her own point of view, and TRvK's latest reactions, I don't blame her. I do wonder why she's going after TvK over Fitz or Kid A... if she'd clarify her season for her vote in 1-3 sentences, that'd make a great big difference in my thoughts regarding her. <span class=\"noboldsig\">4/10</span>.</span><br><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Kid A</span> <span style=\"font-style: italic\">Kid A's said and done a lot of newbie things. I get that. We get that. It's known. But, who here thinks newbishness equates to guilt? I don't. He may be a young kid. I don't know. His style is worlds different from mine in practically every single way. Remember that hummingbird I mentioned that deposited little dollops of expression? If there were a slightly pudgy, lazier one, it'd be Kid A. Then again, it feels like he's been an actual non-entity in this game, because I don't really remember much about what he's said. If anything I'd rather he replace out and let someone new breath life into the game. He did mess up on Bard, too. If there's anyone here who truly hasn't provided much in his ISO, it'd be Kid A. Sorry, but that's just the way it is. If he wanted to get my attention, he'd use better typing skills, too (sounds harsh, but it's real). His posts are a mess and leave me wondering what the hell he even has to say (and note, Kid, if you respond to this with more ineligible stuff, it ain't getting read). He comes off as newbie Town to me, and is lynchbait for Scum, so of course they're going to angle towards him. I, for one, want him to claim.<span class=\"noboldsig\">4/10</span>.</span><br><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">TvK</span> <span style=\"font-style: italic\">Oh boy, Tvk. What do I make of him now? He's gone off and stated my read on him as another town Mason is wrong, even though he tried distracting votes away from her. Then again, Herself did mention having Fitz shoot him, and voted for him momentarily too. Well, here's the thing: I've done that to my Mason partner in the past as well. It doesn't really matter how long you've got your vote on your partner so long as he or she doesn't get lynched, and who can say the supposed Vigilante is gonna acquiesce to her plead, either? His denial seemed convincing enough, although his apparent anger seemed rather mixed. I've probably done crazier things as Mason, too. As for Kid A he's on that train, too, and I'm not really sure if it's worth trying to either derail people off of it, or let it happen and make lucid remarks should he flip Town. Hm. <span class=\"noboldsig\">8/10</span>.</span><br><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">My Milked Eek</span> <span style=\"font-style: italic\">Another one I keep forgetting exists. His attitude kinda sucks, and he's not exactly willing to cooperate in finding Scum. He's also on the easy Kid A wagon. Maybe Kid deserves the increased eagerness by others to lynch him, or maybe not. Some of his personal issues seem to have seeped in and clouded his Scumhunting capabilities, too, like his unnecessary criticism of my questions, sarcastic refusal to comply, you know, basic juvenile stuff. I wonder if he's read one of those big posts of mine like he said he would. He could either be combative Town, or combative Scum; I just can't tell. It would be nice if I could be sure he's willing to work with me, or at least try to. So, I'm not sure where to place him. That, and I've actually forgotten much of what he's posted, from around (693) and older. <span class=\"noboldsig\">4/10</span>.</span><br><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">penguin_alien</span> <span style=\"font-style: italic\">New player, new ISO to contend with. I think she's still catching up. I don't mind the points she brings up in (1042). Reading this, though, \"And Wake88 coming in after 19 pages of nothing and attempting to steamroll people is just lousy,\" makes me wonder which game she's playing, to be blunt. She's also sizing up TvK, Kid, and Fitz. I won't get too in-depth with my reads on her, so I'll say she's basically null-Town to me thus far. <span class=\"noboldsig\">5/10</span>.</span><br><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Regfan</span> <span style=\"font-style: italic\">Has a bit of a reputation here to some, so I have to disregard that while trying to properly read him. My problem with Regfan is that I'm trying to discern whether he's actually a member of Town, or is trying to achieve my lynch as Scum. Like me he's said a lot, and I don't have the energy to unturn every single stone. His spoiler in 91010) makes me wonder why he's extracting meaning about my Annihilator Beam from SG, rather than the source itself. He should ask me instead of someone else, right? (1010) also just reeks of being an attempt to diminish me, then again he did say one of my sentences gave him a greater Townread on me. His (1075), (1081), and (1085) makes me quite a bit more leery of his innocence, though, because he's giving the same deceitful and dismissive vibes as SG had given me. If he's Town, he should work on his own patience and civility, because he's not doing himself any favors calling my narration piss-poor and my analysis fucking useless. I guess we'll have to see what he does next, and if he can keep from getting all critical and offensive. I can see how trying to sift through weeks-old masses of text can be a hassle. <span class=\"noboldsig\">5/10</span>.</span><br><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">ICEninja</span> <span style=\"font-style: italic\">Sort of like with Regfan, it's tough trying to get a read on him, and some of his subtly personal/dismissive behavior isn't helping diplomatic ties. I just can't shake this feeling that he's Scum. It's bothersome, and I'm not sure exactly how to try and explain it. Sucks, doesn't it? He too is gunning for Kid A, like with Bard. If he's wrong again, I'll likely focus my attention on him Day 3. If he really is Town, for the love of God try working with me while being civil and respectful. Getting all aggressive and deaf isn't going to coax me into trusting you. If you really are Town, and if for a moment you suspect I am too, then please don't miss the opportunity at forming a Town bloc with me. Oh, and another thing: I'm struggling to keep up with the 90+ posts, so it's really tough to give a proper general read. That's why I go in-depth, because I have collected everything I need to then chew on and analyze. Because I'm struggling with my read and can't tell if you're TvT or SvT, I just don't know where to pace you. <span class=\"noboldsig\">5/10</span>.</span><br><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Garmr</span> <span style=\"font-style: italic\">I'm having trouble reading him generally, because I don't like doing stuff generally. Everything has to be extremely in-depth and analytic for it to be fine by me. And he's voted for Kid A, too. I wonder what the fallout would be, if any, if Kid flipped Town. His last few posts he's mainly harassed Kid A and TvK. I don't recall the last time he went after ICEninja, Regfan, or Squirrel Girl, either. He's null, too. In-depth would likely provide different results. <span class=\"noboldsig\">5/10</span>.</span><br><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Squirrel Girl</span> <span style=\"font-style: italic\">I've gotten to the point where I just want to ignore all of her criticism. And everyone else's, too. It'd sure do my blood pressure a favor. She hasn't really given me a break, and has fluttered between calling everything I post \"nothing\" (which is enough to put her on ignore), saying all my questions are meaningless (again, ridiculous), calling all of my reads crap even after I spent an hour developing an in-depth read on TvK (again I just want to ignore her because she's being rude). I don't like feeling like she's reaching for every single reason to lynch me, even the crazy and ridiculous ones. If she's Town, she really needs to learn that being SO dismissive and critical is a surefire way to turn other townies against her. Sorry, but that's just the way it is. If I told my colleagues that their fashion sense was crap and that a monkey could work better than them, I'd probably be making enemies hand over fist. So, please don't antagonize me. Town shouldn't be trying to get people to explode. Hell if I know if she's Town, but if she is, she's making my experience here unpleasant, and only Scum does that, right? <span class=\"noboldsig\">3/10</span>.</span><br><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">havingfitz</span> <span style=\"font-style: italic\">I don't really buy your claim, Fitz. If you're an Odd-Night Vig, then it may be reasonable to think there's an Even-Night Vig, too. And if there is, and Scum doesn't kill tonight either, then we're going to have problems because then it'd seem like you're Scum BSing a Vig claim. And I've seen a lot of that happening while playing Mafia. I didn't really suspect you since the Vig claim/Herself death claim. If there are two deaths tonight, then there's more reason to think your claim is reasonable. I just wish you and everyone else had, you know, talked about who was going to dy by your hands Night 1. You'd think that discussion would have come around right after your claim. So I don't really trust you all that much, and have you as Null/Leaning Scum. <span class=\"noboldsig\">4/10</span>.</span><br><br><br><br><br>I really want Kid A to claim. This puts him at L-1. DON'T vote for him until he has a chance to claim, please. If he claims something useful, then I'll take my vote off of him.

She just seems rather subdued to me. Wasn't in favor of a TvK lynch yesterday, but now she's moving in that direction. I'm not sure what the odds are that both Hydras were Town. She's also been sizing Kid A up for a lynch. I'm not convinced she was temperish, either, as she had mentioned. In (943) she's moreso going after Kid A, which could either be innocent, or Scum trying to be really convincing to pull off a \"reasonable\" mislynch; please pardon my skepticism. Oddly with (1057), I tend to get more lost in huge multi-quote walls rather than solid text walls of 4-5 sentence paragraphs. She does have reservations about taking TvK off the table, and from her own point of view, and TRvK's latest reactions, I don't blame her. I do wonder why she's going after TvK over Fitz or Kid A... if she'd clarify her season for her vote in 1-3 sentences, that'd make a great big difference in my thoughts regarding her. 4/10.</div></blockquote><br><br>The anger was quite genuine. And I still question whether fitz is actually vig, but I'm not comfortable looking there for a lynch at the moment.  If he is scum, there are likely 2 other scum to find.  When I get annoyed in mafia I tend toward snark.  Snark itself isn't a scum tell for me, but some players have thoughts about the nature of my snarkish replies and my likely alignment.  When I'm scum, I keep those theories in mind.<br><br>My stances have evolved on both Kid A and on TvK.  I'm not as convinced as Empire was (and regfan is) that Kid A's tinfoil hat theories are a town tell.  With TvK, the thing that stands out most for me is that he engaged fitz about whether he'd shoot Herself but made no effort to talk fitz out of it even after his phraseology was called down.<br><br>My hunch is that if TvK is scum and fitz is actually vig and not scum, then the purpose of that exchange was to see whether it would be safe to leave fitz alone for a night.  If TvK flips scum, then some of my concerns about fitz fake-claiming will be allayed.<br><br>Empire had a strong town read on regfan.  When he let me know he had to replace out, there were two major questions on my mind - what were his final thoughts on our unsure pile (Kid A, TvK, fitz, Eek), and how would he recognize scum-regfan later in the game?<br><br>I'm watching for the stuff that Empire mentioned to me, but so far not seeing anything of concern re regfan.  His case on TvK looks good to me.  I went through TvK's iso and came away with mixed results from the basis of purely what was said and the apparent tone. In context, though, his contribution leans a little scum, and does so in three main events of the game - two of which were wagon-formations, and one of which was fitz' claim.<br><br>So, while I'm sheeping regfan's vote on TvK, and won't claim otherwise, I've combed through TvK's iso and come away with concerns, as well as going through reg's posts about him."}

I want your thoughts on the reasons why I think TvK is scum.

I reached out in my spoilered <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5483194#p5483194\">Post 912</a> asking fro your read on Milked there, I got zero response not even a \"Will do it later\" type comment. Then I wrote down and explained my reasons why I thought TvK was scum very succinctly and got zero response to those either other than \"He's a mason\" bullshit. So yeah, you think I'm not pissed of and annoyed with you? Heck yeah I am. Do I think you're scum? Not really but do I think you're posting a lot of useless things (Like that narration of TvK's play doesn't help anyone), yes. </span> Now I don't want to hear \"Oh he's mason, not lynching him\", Herself didn't just suggest for a TvK vig, she pushed for one, heck she'd have actually lynched TvK yesterday if it wasn't for me (Her vote was on him and she was trying to get votes with the deadline 1-2 days away). So go and read <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5487422#p5487422\">Post 1017</a> and then I want to hear some legitimate thoughts on it.<br><br><div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: A few things about your Post 1094</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display: none;\">1.

If you think that Kid A is newbtown why do you want him to claim, if he's VT wouldn't that be his death warrant?</strike><br>4. SG said you'd had no stances early game whatsoever, I thought your Annihilator beams were you stating scum reads and then trying to strengthen them via questioning, she said your wiki ect. points to otherwise and that it's just a questioning technique.<br>5. Everyone is in 3-4-5 in your reads numbered list with the exception of the TvK!Mason theory which is obviously wrong. So you're saying you have no one that you're reading as \"strong town\" via play?

Especially his last couple of posts where he really focuses on Herself. But still, none of his points could maybe convince me to thinking Herself is scummy.</a> which just means that he doesn't think ICE's points were strong. Also running a mason to L-1 =/= pushing a mason at deadline. At L-1 you can still have time to redirect the lynch elsewhere, at deadline there isn't, Herself pushed him at deadline which makes zero sense if he's a mason ergo he's not and you need to read the case on him.<br><br>PEdit: Wake, I still read Kid As paranoia as town, I don't really see scum going down the thought process of \"Traitor has nightkill, mafia hinting to tratior who to kill\". That said I can't deny the fact that a lot of evidence against him is actually decent (ie. His case on ICE/Fitz being dreadful, him popping in minutes after being mentioned but not stating any reads or content just addressing concerns about himself then) so I'm happy just shelving him and focusing on lynching TvK, then if we get a scum flip there which I think we will then interaction-analysis can be used to get a better read on Kid A."}

The townie thing to do would be to ignore it, sure, but doing so from a scum perspective would have the advantage of looking townie and hoping to draw the counterclaim.

I think I've got one game here as Scum where it was a perfect victory. I do have quite a few other Scum games in other places, but the ones I can remember are in places that require you to log on and post 100 times just to view the hidden subforum. The Open one we won easily, because the Town made it so. <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=51&amp;t=31540\" class=\"postlink\">Open 532</a>. This game, however, isn't nearly as indicative of how well I play as Scum; I play much better than that. This game we won was basically a cakewalk, and all we had to do was practically sit back and let them take care of themselves. I daresay as bad as I am as Town, it balances out because I'm brilliant as Scum."}

And, if so, what do you think of the people whose votes moved?</div></blockquote><br><br>I can understand Eek's turnaround, but I don't agree with it. He seemed pretty convinced of Kid A as scum at the start of day 2, claiming that he had been saying the same stuff about him as ICE had done during day 1. He voted Kid A and added \"until I've reread Garmr\", so I was assuming that Garmr and Kid A were his top scum reads. In #1003 he is still convinced of Kid A scum. But then he starts attacking Wake, who I am still thinking just did something retarded but not necissarily scummy, and away he goes from the Kid A wagon onto Wake. I can see his points, but I don't agree.<br><br>Another thing I would like to bring up about Eek is his read on both me and Garmr. Eek was the driving force behind the Garmr wagon at the end of day 1, which I definitely approved of. Then at the start of day 2 he votes Kid A (still fine by me as he had expressed his doubts about him) and promised to reread Garmr. However, in his latest reads list, Garmr is suddenly in the \"not so sure anymore\"-category, without any indication why he switched from 99% scum to this and I am among his scum reads Wake and Kid A, even though the only thing he has said about me is that I would be scum bussing my buddy Garmr at the end of day 1. But now he just put me next to Wake and Kid A by just saying that he likes Reg's reasons to suspect me...<br><br>Finally, I do think Garmr's switch of wagons is suspect. His reasons to jump on Kid A weren't very convincing (Kid A's posting got worse/I'm confused with him/his content is minimal/shit will be sorted out if he gets lynched), but his switch to Wake is just bad. I'm really toying with the idea of a Kid A/Garmr/fornowunknownthird scum team. Garmr was happy to sit on the early wagon of his scumbuddy, but it went a bit too fast with Kid A suddenly going to L-1. Luckily for him, Wake screwed himself up and Garmr immediatly took the first possibility to change to another wagon. Once again, he tries to justify his swap, not by sheeping other people's reason (which would possibly make him look scummy), but he tries fabricate his own reasons again. But let's face it, those reasons were bad, forced and unconvincing.<br><br>P-Edit: Holy shit, 12 posts while I was writing this. Will look at them when I finish dinner."}

You'll note it contains 'example of action, opinion about said example, and conclusion' and it also took a grand total of two sentences though I guess one might be a run-on. That is what a read looks like, it's simple, direct, has evidence, and a stance. You post walls of mush and then whine that I don't think you're giving opinions as though a mush opinion is actually something anyone can work with in this game. I'm also a pretty easy going squirrel, but I really have to admit I'm getting tired of the constant complaint that life is hard because people don't like your playstyle. If that is so, then either change your playstyle because it isn't great, or embrace your playstyle because it works and to heck and hellfire with people who disagree.This is a game of debate and suspicion, not everyone is always going to love everything you do. Get over yourself and play the game or go away because having people find your play weak is too upsetting to you to operate thereafter.<br><br>I'd also rather not debate you about this anymore, it is not interesting to me nor do I think it helps either of us find scum - and I don't think you are working to find scum and I don't need you trying to clog me from doing the opposite. If my words ring with you, adjust some way, if they don't then ignore this answer and move on with the game in whatever way you think will help town win. But debate with me about your playstyle and my issues with it is most assuredly not that.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5492879#p5492879\" class=\"postlink\">post 1215</a>, My Milked Eek wrote:</cite>That's pretty much the only reservation I have at this point.</div></blockquote><br>It's a pretty solid reservation to have, what's stopping you from moving back to Kid A and also grumping that I did the same?"}

Hopefully this won't be too confusing.<br><br>I'm actually...fairly impressed with MME's play right now. He's pressuring Wake with solid reasoning and making me increasingly confident that my day 1 push towards him was misguided. Wake's defense against MME's push is also bad even for him. This particular post bugs me:<br><blockquote><div><cite>Wake wrote:</cite>Ugh, I'm ambivalent. I don't rush to declaring 100% that someone's Town or Scum as quickly as others. He was at L-2 so I wanted to pressure him into claiming, because if he claimed a Town PR I'd then not seek his lynch anymore. And from my experience it's not that uncommon for Town to vote against Townreads here; I've seen that happen a lot.<br></div></blockquote><br>This directly contradicts a statement you've made earlier about how you hate dropping your vote until you're super sure. Except this time you specifically dropped your vote to get a PR claim from Kid A. The fact that he didn't drop a PR claim suggests that they weren't planning some silly thing in day chat and probably only one of them is scum.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Garmr wrote:</cite>Not caring about who he hammers ;/.<br></div></blockquote><br>It gets better than that. He thinks I'm scum because I put someone at L-1 for him to hammer.<br><blockquote><div><cite>TvK wrote:</cite>Is there actually anyone who sees me and Kid A on the same team? Of the people that have both of us as their top scum reads?<br></div></blockquote><br>While I will occasionally make note of connections I see between players, I really do try my best to find a scum flip before putting much effort in to finding connections. Once we have a scum flip on Kid A I'm going to go back and decide if you can be scum with him.<br><blockquote><div><cite>SG wrote:</cite>@TvK + ICEninja - you guys seem to be the strong holdouts of Kid A scum. With that as a belief, and with what just happened to that wagon, which votes do you find suspect? Do you think a Kid A scum wagon was dismantled onto a Wake scum wagon, or a Wake town wagon? And, if so, what do you think of the people whose votes moved?<br></div></blockquote><br>I feel like MME's case against Wake was really strong. I'm actually somewhat considering joining the Wake wagon simply due to the strength of his case along with my earlier points regarding Wake that have never been satisfied. However, I still feel like Kid A simply cannot be town and, as I've said before, moving my vote off him with be a monumental task. Should we lynch Wake instead of Kid A and Wake flip town then I will be almost completely assured of Kid A's guilt (though the wagon falling off Kid A on to Wake resulting in a scum flip might loosen my suspicion, and remove it completely should Wake flip scum PR). If Wake flips town then people who left the Kid A wagon to lynch Wake are all going to look really bad to me.<br><br>There are QUITE a few players suspicious of Kid A right now who aren't voting for him. I don't like this one bit, especially since he was run up to L-1 then refused to claim.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Wake wrote:</cite><br>1) I felt it was important, and that someone should protect him if he were the Mason. And who exactly is everyone, please? Also, it's been my experience on Mafia for the last 5+ years that you shouldn't hold back your honest thoughts.<br></div></blockquote><br>A mason would claim at L-1. No sane scum is going to fake claim mason when everyone freaking knows there's going to be at least one mason somewhere.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Wake wrote:</cite>It was explained on Day 1 that I was willing to hammer \"Player X\" in order to prevent a no-lynch, which is something to be avoided. Before I said that, I had wanted to lynch Kid A for being the weakest link, but I reasoned that the best way to prevent a no-lynch is to just hammer whoever reached L-1 first.<br></div></blockquote><br>Yet I'm still scummy for doing virtually this exact thing. Huh.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Wake wrote:</cite>In (259) he told Herself that her Town flip would significantly increase his suspicion of Fitz This is kind of a red flag, because she died and flipped Town, but Day 2 has him wanting to see the hammer on Kid A, with him now thinking Fitz just sucks at this game.

I realize I partially share blame for Reg not being able to put down his last post, but that hammer was pretty sketchy.<br><br>I wasn't particularly expecting penguin to die last night. I guess scum caught some mason tell, I was guessing either ffery or Reg would have died should fitz have lived.<br><br>Now this brings me to an interesting point: why did scum shoot the probably mason instead of the claimed vig who will shoot tomorrow?<br>Here is what we do know:<br>-Fitz almost certainly made the shot on Herself night 1. Regardless if it was mafia shooting or vig shooting, we can be almost certain fitz was the one who shot.<br>-If fitz is a town vig, we very likely have one of [doctor, roleblocker, jailkeeper] within town's remaining ranks. Being that last night's kill for scum was certainly successful and night 1's scum kill looks dubious (depends on fitz's alignment) I'm guessing that town doesn't have a role blocker. We're probably looking at a doctor.<br>-Fitz gave his reads in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5494492#p5494492\" class=\"postlink\">this post</a>. Scum could have used those reads to decide if they wanted to keep him around another day. If a vig is town or even null reading all the scum, it is actually in their best interest to keep him alive for one more bullet. 2 townies dying tonight would be disastrous, even if we lynch scum today.<br>-Fitz's role SHOULD be confirmable tonight but he is, at the moment, unconfirmed.<br><br>What I gather from this information is that fitz is slightly more likely to be scum having lived the night than he was day 1 FMPoV, however if he is indeed town then his scum reads are probably also town. If fitz dies tonight and flips town (he virtually has to die tonight if he is a vig, as his kill tonight will clear him beyond doubt in everyone's mind) then I'll more or less clear TvK and Wake based on that alone. There's no way in hell scum would have let fitz lived if they felt like he would probably shoot one of them tonight.<br><br>We can't lynch fitz today, though, as if he is town he's going to pull the bullet away from more useful players (or leave confirmed town alive, I'm cool with either honestly), and if he's scum we'll know more or less certainly by tomorrow and can happily speedlynch him.<br><br>Then, whoa. Wake's claim. 2 masons, an odd night vig, and one shot cop feels like a reasonable town strength, maybe a tad on the strong side (but could easily be balanced by day talk) so that seems to check. The wording, though, claiming \"scope\" is weird to me. I've never heard a cop called a scope here before, only cop and investigator. This leads me to believe that he doesn't actually have a role PM that says scope. Also, I've been pretty hardcore townreading Ffery and would find it hard to believe she's scum at this point. I've been wrong before, but even so. It is indeed very concerning, because Ffery scum implies that my reads all game have been wrong. I'll need to think more about this.<br><br>Wake if you are fake claiming, retract your claim <span style=\"font-style: italic\">immediately</span> or I will go through lengths to ensure I never play with you again. I've never even once seen a VT claiming power role help town at all, and I've seen it cause unnecessary mislynches on no fewer than 2 (and probably more than that) occasions.<br><br>I probably fucked this post up, I'm tired as hell and didn't want to wait until the morning to catch up.

Regardless if it was mafia shooting or vig shooting, we can be almost certain fitz was the one who shot.<br>-If fitz is a town vig, we very likely have one of [doctor, roleblocker, jailkeeper] within town's remaining ranks. Being that last night's kill for scum was certainly successful and night 1's scum kill looks dubious (depends on fitz's alignment) I'm guessing that town doesn't have a role blocker. We're probably looking at a doctor.<br>-Fitz gave his reads in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5494492#p5494492\" class=\"postlink\">this post</a>. Scum could have used those reads to decide if they wanted to keep him around another day. If a vig is town or even null reading all the scum, it is actually in their best interest to keep him alive for one more bullet. 2 townies dying tonight would be disastrous, even if we lynch scum today.<br>-Fitz's role SHOULD be confirmable tonight but he is, at the moment, unconfirmed.<br><br>What I gather from this information is that fitz is slightly more likely to be scum having lived the night than he was day 1 FMPoV, however if he is indeed town then his scum reads are probably also town. If fitz dies tonight and flips town (he virtually has to die tonight if he is a vig, as his kill tonight will clear him beyond doubt in everyone's mind) then I'll more or less clear TvK and Wake based on that alone. There's no way in hell scum would have let fitz lived if they felt like he would probably shoot one of them tonight.<br><br>We can't lynch fitz today, though, as if he is town he's going to pull the bullet away from more useful players (or leave confirmed town alive, I'm cool with either honestly), and if he's scum we'll know more or less certainly by tomorrow and can happily speedlynch him.<br><br>Then, whoa. Wake's claim. 2 masons, an odd night vig, and one shot cop feels like a reasonable town strength, maybe a tad on the strong side (but could easily be balanced by day talk) so that seems to check. The wording, though, claiming \"scope\" is weird to me. I've never heard a cop called a scope here before, only cop and investigator. This leads me to believe that he doesn't actually have a role PM that says scope. Also, I've been pretty hardcore townreading Ffery and would find it hard to believe she's scum at this point. I've been wrong before, but even so. It is indeed very concerning, because Ffery scum implies that my reads all game have been wrong. I'll need to think more about this.<br><br>Wake if you are fake claiming, retract your claim <span style=\"font-style: italic\">immediately</span> or I will go through lengths to ensure I never play with you again. I've never even once seen a VT claiming power role help town at all, and I've seen it cause unnecessary mislynches on no fewer than 2 (and probably more than that) occasions.<br><br>I probably fucked this post up, I'm tired as hell and didn't want to wait until the morning to catch up. As a result I don't have the energy to go through and review it for errors and idiocy like I normally do.

Otherwise they risk him getting an accurate shot off tonight."}

Eek is scummy because he hasn't posted (same reasons why Garmr thought Orestes was scummy).<br>2. Eek is scum because he made a case on Garmr (\"one of Fitz and Eek is scum, highly likely both\"). However, Garmr has debunked it and torn it apart and even literally said. Despite this effort, Garmr still was the second biggest wagon at the end of day 2. To underline how much crap the case of Eek was, Garmr literally said \"I also really can't be fucked being in a game where cases like eeks are considered semi decent. It was horrible and debunked with one post.\"<br>3. Fitz claims Vig. Eek is town for putting in effort to make a case instead of just jumping on Fitz. Garmr consideres himself a target for Fitz's nightkill (who knows why?). Garmr's main scumread now is TvK.<br>Day 2<br>1. Eek needs another look because his wagon (of 4 votes) dismantled too quickly.<br>2. Garmr likes Eek's case on Kid A (if one of them is scum, the other is town. Seeing that he put his vote on Kid A shortly afterward, he has to assume Kid A is scum and Eek is town).<br>3. Repeats point 2 again (and adds that the only suspicion he had of Eek was that his wagon dismantled too quiclkly).<br>4. Eek votes Wake and Garmr tries to follow him with a badly fabricated case of himself.<br>5. Garmr takes Eek's comment (hammer away) quite literally and hammers Kid A.<br>Day 3<br>1. Eek and TvK were the scum on Kid A's wagon.<br>2. Thinks Eek is twisting his words after his really hard to understand pun.<br>3. Once again, Eek's case is weak. Getting ready for more debunking. Informs everyone again how easily he debunked the last case on him.<br><br>I think Eek summarised this perfectly: if you suspect Garmr, you will be suspected by him.<br><br>Garmr's read on TvK<br><br>Day 1<br>1. TvK is nullscum.<br>2. TvK is null (could reach town with a little more effort).<br>3. Fitz claims Vig. Bard and TvK drop down to scum because of recent behavior. (To clarify, this behavior was not being on the Fitz wagon and voting Garmr at the time).<br>4. TvK is scum (one of the reasons being not going for Kid A that day, even though it was obvious that Garmr was my main scumread).<br>5. TvK is still scum, but Garmr rather votes Bard.<br>Day 2<br>1. Garmr points out that Regfan convinced him to get my wagon (a huge 2-vote wagon) over to a mislynch on Bard.<br>2. TvK is Garmr's strongest scumread, the second time even right above Kid A. Did Garmr simply forget to vote me? Or would he be too suspicious if he was the only one doing so.<br>3. Garmr starts to lean more towards Kid A, because TvK's posting has improved (I indeed had said nothing bad about Garmr for a bit, ergo my posting improved. Seriously, this is got to be the way he is thinking).<br>4. Garmr asks Eek what he would say if he said that TvK was a townread now.<br>5. Garmr apparently thought I was a Cop or something (\"The theory revolved around you knowing I was town day 2 through certain night actions and being embarrassed as shit talking about me\"). I go back to the scumlist for still finding Garmr scummy.<br>Day 3<br>1. TvK and Eek are Garmr's top scumreads.<br>2. Garmr votes TvK, because he feels I should have pushed him harder at the start of day 2.<br><br>What have we learned?<br>1. If you don't say anything (bad) about Garmr, you move up in his townlist. This works the other way around too.<br>2. If you are Garmr's top scumread, you practically never will have his vote on you.<br>3. Garmr's puns are incredibly hard to understand. Not understanding them equals misrepping.<br><br>If this is not the way scum plays, than I don't know at all how they do... Also, mind the fact that Garmr loves bragging about himself, and that he's constantly reminding us all of how brilliant his scum skills are. Why would town brag about their skills as scum in the game?<br><br>And finally the thing that absolutely bugged me most of all were his final two quotes:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5501908#p5501908\" class=\"postlink\">post 1431</a>, Garmr wrote:</cite><span class=\"noboldsig\">But to be honest I really don't mind getting mislynched at this point because it will be obvious that your scum.</span></div></blockquote><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5501915#p5501915\" class=\"postlink\">post 1433</a>, Garmr wrote:</cite>eek I'm going to give you some advice. <span class=\"noboldsig\">If you some how are town and you really are content on lynching me.

It's the kind of advice I'd be giving a partner in daytalk and can see his partners giving it to him.<br><br>Really the only partial doubt I've had about my Garmr town read is the hammer given that he should know better than not to wait for me, I'll save his ISO in tabs so when I disconnect the internet (Using a internet USB that I have limited time on per day) I can read through it and make sure that I haven't missed anything but I did like his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5501915#p5501915\">Post 1433</a> and think it was genuine.<br><br>The more I look at this though the more I think 2 scum might actually be the case which is kind of painful to admit given that Wake was the one that suggested it first. I really can't see 3 people here being scum and while it's possible I might be totally sucking this game and be made fun of post-game for it I think the simpler solution is most of my strong town reads are town.<br><br>Now can we fucking do this please:<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"> Vote: TvK </span>"}

I have lots of strongs town reads. And I mean, lots. For there to be 3 scum I have to be massively wrong about a few people and I think what's more likely is 2 scum than me having a read I'd bank the entire game on being wrong. I also think there's only two realistic possibilities here 1) Wake is scum thinking he can push a 1 v 1 and win (Which is stupid play) and lynching him is lynching a scum or 2) Wake is town gambiting and if not lynched will just vote Ffyert in lylo making him a massively liability. Either way he's the optimal lynch.<br><br>MME, I don't see Masons-1-shot-cop-vig being the setup, far too many chances of confirmable players. Assume cop gets an innocent on a VT and vigs shot goes of on scum or a VT or anything really. That's Cop investigation + Vig + 2 Masons as clear with the cop being considered as highly likely town, that's 5 potential clears, too many for a setup so even alone from a setup speculation standpoint Wake is scum/fake-claiming. To put it simply though Empire (One head of the Street hydra) is someone I've known and played with for 2 years in 100's of games and I know his scum vs town play of by heart and his play here was his town play without a shadow of a doubt, I'd bet everything I own on it being town."}

Despite playing a very solid town game I wound up lynched on day 4 mostly because of setup speculation.  I'm not totally discounting the possibility of both, but whereas doc/1-shot bulletproof can potentially lengthen a game by fouling up night kills, a nerfed vig and a vengeful  both potentially decrease the number of mislynches town gets and that feels wrong to me in this size game."}

I can't do it in  a vacuum though, I'll need interactions and I'll need people to tell me when I've ventured too far into tinfoil hat territory.<br><br>I'm going to start with possible scumteams.<br><br>These are the scenarios I can envision.<br><br>- fitz is vig, wake is town cop with a genuine guilty results (I'm miller)<br>- fitz is vig, wake is town cop with an inno result he doesnt believe (thinks I'm godfather)<br>- fitz is vig, wake is vanilla town <br>- fitz is vig, wake is scum<br>- fitz is scum, wake is town cop with a genuine guilty results (I'm miller)<br>- fitz is scum, wake is town cop with an inno result he doesnt believe (thinks I'm godfather)<br>- fitz is scum, wake is vanilla town <br>- fitz is scum, wake is scum<br><br>Excluding fitz and wake: <br><br>My town reads:  Reg, ICE, SG, MME, Garmer<br><br>My my scum read: TvK <br><br>That's right.

And we are at 4-3 with fitz-scum, Scum x, Scum y, wake-town, and 3 town.<br><br>What if fitz is town and wake is scum?<br><br>town-fitz knows I'm miller.  What should he do?  Hold fire? shoot into the non-wake players trying to hit scum?  (If yes - TVK PLEASE).  If he shoots then there could be 2 kills unless he shoots the same player scum go for or we have a protective role that gets lucky.  Worst case if he shoots is 3-3 and game over.  Best case is 4-2.  Worst case if he holds fire is 4-3.  Best case, protective role if it exist gets lucky and tomorrow is 5-3.<br><br><br>Remaining scenarios:<br><br>I flip vanilla town.  Should town-fitz assume that wake is scum, or that wake is town?  He could be either.<br><br>Based purely on combinations, fitz comes up scum in 3 out of 4 and wake comes up scum in 1 out of 4.  This actually matches the strength of my reads on both of them at the end of day 2 pretty well.<br><br>If fitz is scum there is a zero chance that he will hold his fire tonight.  And a 100% chance he will hit town.<br><br>If he's town, then those percentages are indeterminate and it depends on what he thinks town's chances of a win are if he shoots and hits town vs not shooting at all.<br><br>So:<br><br>I flip VT<br>fitz is town<br>Wake is unknown<br><br>What should fitz do on night 3?<br><br>Let's talk about this.<br><br>If fitz is scum then he's gonna do what he's gonna do and that is out of town's hands but worst case tomorrow starts at 4-3, not 3-3."}

Rule out #5 since as stated above millers not possible, #6 is possible but if it's the case he's fucking retarded and #7 and #8 are both possible. As for your \"N3 what should we do\" I flat out do not trust Fitz to vig tonight if we mslynch today, if it's 10 v 3 then his vig shot would be our lylo lynch decider and given his competence I think we're more likely to lose from his vig decision than a lynch one and if it's 11 v 2 then his vig shot would be use of our last mslynch and again I don't trust him to vig right for that either.

This might be because there was no anti wake traction after he dropped his first claim (second claim would be confirming that it's not a gambit). Only regfan was against it in that timespan. But one person would not be enough to get a wake lynch.<br><br>Think about it. What would happen if wake got lynched? Fferyllt would be confirmed town. What would happen if fferyllt got lynched? Wake would be confirmed town. In neither case would they draw wagon attention or a fitz nightkill. Coasting to an easy endgame. <br><br>What would happen with a counterclaim? Scum has the real cop, his investigations and fferyllt in the clear. Lynching wake or the counterclaim would have had no meaning to the rest of the game for fferyllt. Also, the inclusion of a doctor in a possible cop(not wake)-mason-vig setup would have been overkill. So this was a safe claim and any possible counterclaims could have been nightkilled.<br><br>Talking of fitz. I think, in this scenario, that his odd night aspect might have been an inspiration for this night 2 cop. \"It would fit together!\" As some might think (me, that was me). This would give extra cred to the claim. Give it a scope name \"think back to quadraxis, you guys!\" (I think that was fferyllt, can't find who wrote that)<br><br>Something else bugging me about this situation is that fferyllt is voting tvk. I don't care how town my read would be on someone, if he has a guilty on me when I'm town in a _normal_ game, he's scum. If I were fferyllt, I wouldn't rest until wake was dead. But here she is, voting tvk. This makes no sense. Unless she's preparing wake to call out tvk on day 4 as being bussed. Regardless of my stance on TvK, he is the default suspect of today had wake not claimed. This has been a game of easy suspects so far after all.<br><br>Another point of interest is how fferyllt was the one mentioning wake has a love for gambits. As town. It almost seems as if she was setting up wake to be perceived as town. Wake mentions that regfan was in his game and that regfan would have been the one telling fferyllt of that gambit, but in this scenario, we're skipping the middle man and there's wake telling fferyllt: \"hey I've done some gambits in my time.\" Fferyllt was also the one telling us about wake's experience. It just feels like she's setting up wake to be perceived as real, as town while \"taking the lynch gracefully\".<br><br>There was a lot of duality in fferyllts posts before wake confirmed his claim: he's gambiting or we go 1v1. She might have been testing the waters to see which way we would swing on a guilty on her and being non-committed to either standpoint is a big plus in such a time.<br><br>And as a last benefit, this balances the game a lot more. Perhaps a roleblocker or a tracker on their side to even some things out  and I feel that the game is a lot more balanced that way.<br><br><br>The conclusion to this post isn't meant to be taken that seriously, the thing is though, it could fit. Just wanted to get that out there, just in case it's true, so I could go AHA! afterwards.<br><br>Some of the things I pointed out are really odd though, like the tvk vote, planting wake as town, etc. Something is really off on this duel and I don't know what."}

I've been on the receiving end of gambits like these and worse, and I ALWAYS respond as pissed off Townie, because I'm innocent. Didn't one or two of you even agree her response was wrong? MME? I better fucking hope you're not Scum."}

So either Reg and Garmr are BOTH scum or Wake is scum. Being that Wake and Garmr and literally my strongest 2 town reads at the moment, I find that incredibly hard to believe.<br><br>Everything tracks with Wake's play being scum play to get ffery lynched and SG night killed (who were presumably the last 2 threats), and the only reason I'm not voting yet is that nagging feeling in the back of my head. Ffery believed with such passion that you're idiot town and not scum, and I feel like I need to REALLY think this through before I lynch.<br><br>If Wake is scum then both fitz and Reg are insta-clear. We're at an interesting situation where scum is <span style=\"font-style: italic\">forced</span> to night kill Reg as he can protect fitz. This then gives fitz a shot tomorrow night, meaning town has a guaranteed win here. PoE means Wake + TvK + one of either Garmr or MME. We lynch Wake today, TvK tomorrow, and either Garmr or MME on the final day with fitz shooting the other for a set win.<br><br>I suppose from other's perspectives I could potentially be the final scum, but even so with 3 of us being in the final pool where 1 is lynched and 1 is vigged we're almost certain of a victory."}

I told someone the other day that I don't follow my meta; my meta follows me.  But, meta has a trajectory just like stances in games do.  One game isn't enough.  Two games aren't enough, unless it's a really new player.  With 4 or 5 recent games, you can see what is changing in a player's style.  And it's not like you have to read the whole game to pick up on the stuff I analyze.  My in-game reads are heavily tone and timing based, and that's what I look for in meta.  In some cases, I don't even need to read the words.  The textual body language is that different between a person's town and scum games."}

If you want to increase games where you're being town-read, in addition to the excellent suggestions from others here, (it may be repetitive; apologies if it is) I'd recommend working on genuinely cooperating with others--the vast majority of the time (some weird multiball late games excepted) as town the majority of your fellow players are going to be on your side.

I can get annoyed, and at times I get <span style=\"font-style: italic\">pointed</span>, but learning to work with others is tool #1 in your Town arsenal.

This game ran super smoothly, replacements were prompt, the setup was enjoyable, the space pictures on the VCs (and the frequency of VCs) were awesome. 10/10 would play in your games again.<br><br>Secondly, I would like to extend a particular high 5 to my scum buddies. Fitz didn't play the strongest game ever but lurked what I felt was just the <span style=\"font-style: italic\">perfect</span> amount. Not enough to be noticed for it, but enough to drop under the radar for people to forget about you and focus on lynchbait. Reg was number 1 here. I got Kid A lynched and gathered some town reads but this guy orchestrated everything. You were fantastic. Thank you for replacing in!<br><br>I feel like I should address Wake next. I've come back with a cooler head (after being legitimately upset at your actions, I'm serious that wasn't faked, just don't do things like that ever) I have a few suggestions for you. Look at how I got Kid A lynched. That's pretty much exactly what you need to do as town. I worked with people, I prodded people's reasoning for disagreeing with me, I kept in everyone's mind that this guy needed rope, and <span style=\"font-style: italic\">most importantly of all</span> I presented clear and powerful and legitimate reasons why he is more likely to be scum than town. Just because I was scum pushing a mislynch didn't mean my push on him wasn't solid. If I was town I would have came to the exact same conclusion. Just try to take a look at my day 2 play, at how I worked with people who thought I was town, and I pushed people who I thought were town, to work together. I actually attempted this quite a lot during day 1, unsuccessfully. Which frustrated me, so I get where you're coming for, but it happens. You don't always get your way in mafia.<br><br>Ffery (and to a lesser extent, Emp) was very strong this game. You guys misread myself and Reg, but you were entirely unlynchable, and you were frustratingly VT. It was risky to use a night kill on you so when Wake came and shut you down that was basically a godsend for us. We would have had to leave SG alive, which was NOT what we wanted. I have to say I really did feel legitimately bad for you. I haven't read the dead QT yet but I asked mod to send you hugs from us.<br><br>Speaking of Nutsy McSexytail, you are fun to play with and had a good game. Some reads were off, but not all of them. I laughed more than once reading your posts. Better luck next time!<br><br>Garmr you definitely played strong town, but your reads (no offense) were awful. I was super happy to keep you around as long as possible because I was pretty sure you'd win for us in lylo. You definitely gave off megatown vibes though and you were also going to be REALLY hard to lynch.<br><br>Herself played quite well. It was unfortunate for you that you were the N1 kill, but that was largely because you were right. I think you had all 3 scums pegged at one point or another during day 1. The fact that we flipped a mason night 1 was largely instrumental in our easy victory. Out of everyone I'd say you probably had the #1 strongest town play, and were unfortunately punished for it.<br><br>Kid A, I actually forgot my role PM when I was putting my case together on you because I believed it so thoroughly. No offense man but this wasn't your best game. I'd suggest going through and reading my push against you because it is <span style=\"font-style: italic\">exactly</span> what I would have done as town. I even started looking through your play to see if I could figure out who your scum buddies were before I mega facepalmed.<br><br>LolWagons/Penguin was also probably just as strong as Herself this game. Boy that mason team...you guys could have won the game for town if you didn't pull 2 bullets so early. Reg, being brilliant as he is, was quite confident you were the second mason. I just wanted you dead because penguin's reads were fucking spot on. *Shiver* you scared me. Well played.<br><br>MME you were the most difficult push I had. I didn't believe in my case against you at all and it was BY FAR the most forced. Out of all of the non power players, I'd give you the honorable mention of being town's best played. You certainly were the strongest of the endgamed players, and I want to commend you for that. Your day 2 play was so ridiculously town it hurt to notice that I had my vote on you.<br><br>In regards to TSB, I honestly don't remember a lot about you. Your reads were pretty off so I wanted to keep you around, but the wagon on you wasn't to be turned. Sorry you got lynched so quick after joining the game though, that's always a bummer. Better luck next time!<br><br>TvK honestly I don't think your play was that bad. You were the second most fabricated scum read I had. If you were a stronger presence in game I think town would have actually had a much better chance to take this game home. Don't feel bummed about this game, I promise it wasn't on you.<br><br>And to those of you who left some commentary on this game, I've agreed with pretty much everything you guys have said. It's always nice to have some 3rd party perspective on things!"}

And because Scum love logic, which is why I've never lost as Scum in 5-6 years, what else do you have besides speculation?</div></blockquote> You're ignoring the important parts. On the surface-level, a town player will do scummy stuff, and a scum player will do towny stuff.<br><br>There's a reason I never scumhunt by the literal word. Because that fight, by logic, is going to end up wrong 90% of the time. The way I scumhunt isn't by some magically-in-tune gut, either, contrary to my reputation for it. The way I scumhunt is by actually trying to figure people out. To understand them at a fundamental level. This goes beyond their alignment. When I try to figure someone out, I'm not just figuring them out as a player in that game. I'm figuring them out as a person, in general, and learning a ton about them.<br><br>With that fundamental understanding of who they are as a person, then. And only then. Can I begin looking into understanding them as a player, who has an alignment. This takes time, effort, and practice. But when it works...it works damn-well. I realize that I'm not you, and that you're not going to be able to apply this as well as I do. That's okay. You don't need to be me; you need to be you, and only you know what works best for you. But what you DO need? Is to understand what I'm talking about.<br><br>There's a difference between knowing something and actually UNDERSTANDING that something and actually APPLYING that something. The three are entirely different things. You might know that you should be figuring out the person. But do you understand why? (It's because mafia's a social game, a game of humanity, and you're dealing with actual human beings, not statistical numbers, not an equation that you plug in to try and solve.) And even if you do...can you actually apply it? Do you know how?<br><br>That's what I'm getting at.<br><br>Take it from me.<br><br>I was in your boat as a player at a time.<br><br>Hell! Just look at the opinions of me. Pre-2010 joindate, do you see many (if any) players treating me like you see, say, a 2013 player treat me? No. (Hell, even a large number of 2011 players treat me not-so-kindly, but they have reasons, too, since my game in 2011 was hit-or-miss.) You don't. Because despite having fought to improve it for literally YEARS, the damage I did to my reputation when I played back in 2010 can never be forgotten. I had the smarts I needed, but my head was in entirely the wrong place. My attitude was not what it needed to be. I heard what people said, but I didn't truly comprehend it, and in part, that was because I didn't want to. Because I wanted myself to be better than I actually was.<br><br>My attitude was basically the same as what I'm seeing from you in games you play in now. (Yes, even the bit about being blacklisted. There are plenty of players who blacklisted me, and <span style=\"font-style: italic\">they weren't wrong to do so</span>; I deserved it.) Now, I'm not you. So you might ultimately end up being different. But you need to not discard my words of wisdom if you don't want to repeat your fate, here. As a social game, the main factor determining victory? Isn't skill. Isn't logic. Isn't gut. Isn't gambiting. Isn't roles. Isn't any of that. The main factor contributing to victory is <span style=\"font-style: italic\">attitude</span>, and yours is in serious need of a paradigm shift.<br><br>I'm not talking about a minor tweak in your play. I really mean it when I say you need to take a step back, breathe, and totally re-think your approach to the game, because I'm not sure the train of thought you're going down will ever lead to a positive way. The important bits aren't what you did well. But what you did poorly. And as the multitude of responses in here have shown, from the mod, from the scum, from the other town players, from the setup reviewers, hell, <span style=\"font-style: italic\">from the listmod herself</span>...there's a LOT of that. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\"><br><br>If you blindly try and focus on what you think you did well this game, it's not going to serve you well in future games, because what worked well this game likely won't work well in a future game. What you need. What you really need as a player. Is to think about what MADE the things you did well this game be good. That fundamental drive behind the game is what makes things work. And to also analyze the opposite side. What makes the things that didn't work well this game be bad? Trace it back to the root of the problem. (In this case, a large part of the root problem being your current outlook on the game.)<br><br>You can't expect to reinvent your play overnight and have it work. It took me literally years to get as far as I've gotten, and I've still got a lot of progress to make. (I'm no saint, contrary to what my title may imply. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\">) You can shift your mindset, and with the altered perspective. With that different view of the game. You can make progress gradually. But it's a long, slow, painful process that takes time and conscious effort on your part to improve. If you want to improve. Really want to improve. You have to accept all this. You have to accept that there are things that you'll need to let go of, and things you'll need to adapt to. The game of mafia is fluid, ever-moving. (I call it the game of humanity for a reason. Just like humanity continues to progress forward, so too does the game.) Meaning that you need to evolve yourself as the game does, too.<br><br>And the game on mafiascum.net. Is a game of people interactions. As has been mentioned, <blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5513066#p5513066\" class=\"postlink\">post 1846</a>, Wake88 wrote:</cite>And Garmr, you should have listened. We hadn't lost yet at the start of Day 4, and I sure as hell didn't twist your arm to vote me.</div></blockquote> Blaming others is a path to a dark place. That was one of my main shortcomings. I refused to believe that I could be the main problem. While I knew I wasn't perfect. While I knew I was flawed. I assumed that I was not the main cause of the problem. I assumed that others were to blame. I assumed that they were at fault. Not myself. Because while I screwed up, it was ultimately THEM who lynched me, right?<br><br>While this can, on occasions, end up being true *coughcoughbbmollaandcooldogIstillwillneverforgiveyoucoughcough*, nine times out of ten...it isn't. There's AT LEAST equal blame...if not more...on the person having taken this attitude. (In this case, you.) Garmr's play wasn't perfect, but it was much better than you've given him credit for.<br><br>If you're actually willing to listen, I can say more. I was only skimming the game, so I can't give you much feedback from the time of the game itself. But I only need the post-game to tell you how you can improve, because your attitude in it tells the whole tale. (Yes, I know from experience. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\"> My in-game personality actually hasn't changed THAT much over the last few years. But if you look at my post-game posting, I'm an entirely different person.)"}

It won't be easy to get there. But it's not impossible, if you actually take the advice people are giving you to heart. It took me a while to do so. (Most of the things you see me lecture on? Are things that I was lectured on. I ignored them at the time. I heard them. I thought I was listening to them. But I never truly let them soak in. I never truly listened, because I didn't take them to heart until much later.) I screwed up badly in 2010. I also had a ton of screwups in 2011. Hell, I still screwed up once or twice in 2012, too. But as time went on, I did so progressively less and less. That wasn't because I got better at not screwing up. It was because I got better at listening to people and understanding, truly understanding, their words.<br><br>There is potential in you. But that potential is currently locked behind a solid block of issues, issues that you'll need to understand, recognize, and try to fix. So do a little soul-searching. I mention above that one of the fundamental things you need to do is to understand a player not only as just a player, but as a person as well. The first player you need to know? The first person you need to truly understand?<br><br>...Is yourself. And right now, bluntly, you don't. You might think you do. \"How could I not know myself?\" But you don't. You won't until you apply the things I said to yourself. Look at who you are. The good, the bad, the in-between. (Often-times, the bad can be turned into good!) And understand it. By understanding yourself. By knowing who you truly are. You'll be able to better approach others and work best with them. By knowing your strengths and weaknesses. By trying to know their strengths and weaknesses. You can bind them together. You can turn mutual strengths to augment each other, and let your weaknesses cancel one another out. <br><br>As I said. It's a long road. You won't instantly master it. Hell, I still haven't mastered it! But it's what you need to do. And trust me. You will be glad you did it. Not just as a player. It'll help you as a player, yes. But as a person. Mafia helped turn my life around, from going to a bad place into a better one. And it was for precisely that reason--I learned to understand myself. So I cannot stress that enough. I cannot recommend it to you more, the importance of it. <span class=\"noboldsig\">Know who you are.</span><br>And know what you want to become."}

But you need to understand that there was a difference between the two. ffery was considered universally town because she was showing her town self through-and-through. Regfan was considered universally town because he manipulated everyone into reading him that way. It's perfectly fine to question why someone's a universal townread. But you're not questioning the townread. (At least, you shouldn't be.) You should be questioning the WHY <span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"font-style: italic\">behind</span></span> the townread. The reason. The fundamental motive, mindset, DRIVE, behind why that townread is so universal. And though it was invisible at the time to the players, in hindsight, the difference between ffery and Regfan was the difference between day and night.

Overreacting isn't. If you see something, you can push it. But when doing so...you have to have a clear mind on why you're doing it. You have to have a clear idea on what you're pushing, and more importantly, WHY. To have that end goal in sight, and also acknowledging (this is a biggie) that what you actually get might not be what you were expecting. Can't stress that enough. Things won't always work as you expect them to. So you have to recognize they didn't go as you thought they would, and then analyze why not.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I wouldn't have gambitted if I didn't have to feel like this was a popularity contest.</div></blockquote> And again. This is the wrong outlook on the game. The game of mafia is not who-waves-the-biggest-dick. It's not whoever carries the biggest stick. It's not whoever is the most famous. It's not whoever has the most glorious record behind their name. Those? Are all meaningless statistics as far as I'm concerned. The game of mafia is about understanding others. The people who're \"popular\" aren't popular because they aimed for popularity. They are 'popular' because they actually bother to put effort into knowing others and working with them. (Or, as scum, manipulating the players into THINKING they're working with them, when in fact, the scum have the town players on puppet strings.)<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5513132#p5513132\" class=\"postlink\">post 1853</a>, Wake88 wrote:</cite>And I'm not as bad person, and I'm not a bad player (especially as Scum).

Key word--attacking. You're on the defensive, perceiving yourself to need to defend yourself. I can say this with no assumption attached because you might not even realize you've done so but it's exactly what you ARE doing. You're assuming people are attacking your integrity, when in truth...they're not.<br><br>They're not trying to <strike>rob</strike> hurt you. They're trying to help you. You're not a bad person, but aspects of your person are bad. (This is true of everyone. The difference is, in good players, said aspects rarely if ever show up. They're...showing up frequently for you, Wake. You don't even realize it, but they're all there.) You're not necessarily a bad player, but your current path is going to lead you to become one, rather than the good player you have the potential to be. <br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>My gut just told me Ffery was too-true-to-be-Town, like Regfan actually was.<br>You tell me what I should have done with my gut feeling.</div></blockquote> Analyze it!

If you look at things broadly, it can sometimes just <span style=\"font-style: italic\">click</span> into place.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>How the hell else would I have gotten Ffery lynched? I didn't have the time or energy to wade through a popularity contest.</div></blockquote> The way to get a player others are reading as town lynched isn't to gambit. Never was, and never will be. Nor is it to strongarm your way through the lynch. Was for a time, but wasn't originally and ideally never will be again. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\"> The way to get a player others are reading as town lynched? Is to work with them and convince them otherwise on their read.<br><br>Recognize why they have that townread. Explain to them that you understand why they concluded that, but respectfully say that you think their conclusion (while not unreasonable) is ultimately wrong. And explain where you're coming from with the contrary. Explain why you see what you see. Be open. Be receptive. And they will reciprocate. I know it's been said, but I need to say it all the same--treat others with the respect you want to be treated with. And it'll make all the difference in the world.<br><br>People don't always go along with what I say. But they go along with what I say more often than not, because that's exactly what I do. I acknowledge them. I recognize them. I understand they are people. People who have put their own time, energy, and effort into figuring things out (assuming they're town, that is). People who don't want to see that work wasted. People who don't want it carelessly discarded. So I work with them. I even direct them using their own logic. An example of this applicable to this game is even listed above, if you see where I'm going with this. Say I was a player this game.<br><br>You said that you thought ffery was too town to be town. (Okay, so that wording is a fallacy and a strawman of your argument, but just run with the simplification for the time being. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\">) Instead of ignoring you, I can acknowledge your existence and your point, going, \"That's a good theory, but have you tried applying that logic to Regfan?\" Not those exact words.

You asked lots of decent questions that could have given town info had they been analyzed and followed up on, but most of your questions, once answered, were rarely discussed later.

I'd say your best play was during lylo, you gave me a bit of pause when you had literally called out all scum players at some point until I realized you had also called all 3 town players scum as well. I think had you simply locked down the fact that FROM YOUR POINT OF VIEW Reg and fitz were both more or less guaranteed scum, you would have had a MUCH better time of surviving the game to lynch Reg.

When I replaced in I was fairly shocked to see that he was my scum partner as I had a very strong town read on him at the time, I think I'd have struggled catching him at all if I was town bar interaction analysis (Kid A's points about how ICE flipped his reads and thoughts on Fitz were actually relatively spot on, he just went about pushing it the wrong way). ICE's activity and logical approach towards the game also made him a fantastic partner to have since he helped plan what our best strategy was. Also while Fitz probably wasn't anyones \"Strongest town read\" I think he pulled of his claim well enough to hide in the shadows and as someone else put it \"Was the perfect mix between lurking and not lurking\". So thanks massively to both of these two for helping us pull through on this game and keeping me motivated to want to push for the win.<br><br>I'll keep the Wake bit short (By my standards..) because others have gone over it and it seems to be most of the post-game activity but <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">do not fake-claim again</span>, it's something that very rarely works in the towns favour and very often kills the credibility of a player while leading to a mslynch. If you really want to do something remotely like that make sure you retract it way before a lynch so that people aren't lynching based on limited and incorrect information. If you think that someone is being incorrectly universally town-read attack the reasoning behind the town read on them, state reasons why you doubt that they're town. Also while your \"questions\" tactic does have some potentially benefit from it you never really went anywhere with it so I'd suggest avoiding doing that in the future as well as avoiding posting narrations of peoples ISO's, it's just IoA and leads towards people not wanting to read your posts. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">As town a key thing is you want people to WANT to read your posts.</span>  If I see you you honestly take on board all of this advice in another game then I wouldn't have an issue playing with you again, until then though you'll have excuse me for not joining your games.<br><br>I thought a lot of the town played decent games, they just never played them at the same time in the game and never got the connection and communication going between them or got nightkilled before they got a chance to really out or push their thoughts. Herselfs and Streets D1 reads were fairly accurate and really threatened our chances of winning the game as did Kid A's reads and thoughts on ICE/Fitz D2 as was Slaxx's and PA's reads. MME, SG and Garmr all made themselves really obvtown and hard to lynch at various points during the game. Had it all fired on one day I think town would have had this, I think one scum lynch alone would have opened this game up since interaction analysis might have outed another scum and created clears but it didn't go that way thankfully and now I have one scum game I can be semi-proud of!"}

I guess I never got so into it, or considered studying and understanding the people.)</span><br><br>My original plan was not to gambit, but to keep pressing, asking questions, and really start utilizing what I got from them. It was just tough, because between work and the demands of the other players, it made it tough getting around to other things. Basically, pulled in many different directions. Iirc, SG said you can't please everyone, nor should you try, but at least in real-life I try to be as, I'm trying to think of the term, \"socially attractive\" as possible. Also, Day 3, I was prepared to give it my all, and if I somehow managed to reach L-1, I'd at least have a fallback by then claiming Town Shield and making it known that Mr. Fitz never received my protection. I guess I really didn't know Ffery too well, which is why my gut went off the charts in response to her posts. Whenever I'm Scum I'm incredibly reserved, calm, and logical. I saw that in Ffery, and had even noted it in one of my posts about her being like a mirror of myself when I'm Scum (and I've never gotten lynched as Scum.) The game of Mafia really is deep, isn't it?<br><br>I'm trying to adapt and augment my meta. It's tough rewiring years of play that was accepted as normal elsewhere.<br><br>I shouldn't be so afraid of sharing my honest thoughts, either. Also, I can't control the situation, but I can control my reaction to them. You have to live that when you're working in healthcare, so I don't get why I can do this in real-life, yet am having difficulty with it online. If only you guys knew me in real-life, you'd think we were two different people. I swear. Even <span style=\"font-style: italic\">I</span> think that.  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif\" alt=\":eek:\" title=\"Eek\"> Then again, in healthcare you aren't in a situation where it's either paranoid Townies or evil impostors raring to break your neck or put a cap in yo' ass.<br><br>What I need to do. What I REALLY need to do, is start understanding the people in this forum. It's hard though, because lack of time really has me shackled more often than not. Also, don't attack people personally or lose control of yourself. Mafia can be extremely stressful depending on the situation you know you're in.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>IMO obvtown is wearing your alignment on your sleeve and showing your motivations in every action and stance you take. It means being clear and expressive about what you are thinking and why. It means at every turn, every role claim, every wagon run-up, thinking about how to make it do good things for town.</div></blockquote><br><br>I'm going to start doing this. This isn't bragging: I'm very intelligent. But, I have difficulty working with people, and am susceptible (it's uncommon as a whole) to treating people who don't think or understand as quickly as I do badly. It's not just about being right, or being REALLY quick at gathering, processing, and applying information. You have to be able to PERSUADE others. And it's not enough to be right. You gotta coax people. Give them some honey. Make 'em laugh a bit. Deprecate yourself humorously some, or pay an honest compliment you might otherwise not have the time to give. I think a lot, very quickly, very deeply, all the time. It's draining. It can and does turn some people off. Intelligence is the acquisition and application of knowledge and skills, but what is it worth in a game based on interaction if you don't have the social art of persuasion?<br><br>There were things in this game that didn't help me help Town, but I could have better controlled my reactions to them. At least look over each post of mine and edit/condense/make it more calm and respectful before posting. The issue with SG, ICE, Reg, and MME criticizing my questions and large posts really angered me, and I wasn't sure whether I should engage them on that, or follow the advice of others and flat-out, completely ignore it while in game. Ignoring it because you are who you are and you cannot possibly please everyone.<br><br>At the moment I DO know that my <span style=\"color: #848482\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Annihilator Beam</span></span> has promise. It's flavorized fun from my Quadraxis account, which comes from my ultimate favorite video game series <span style=\"font-style: italic\">Metroid Prime</span>. I just need to really USE the reactions I get from all of my questions, and keep on using it even if some guys complain about it. There was another flavorized \"ability\" I was considering using, and it's a really interesting concept, but I think I'm going to wait with it a bit.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">And the Reads List issue.</span> I read your original and revised article on this Mastin, and I'm still stuck on what to do about it. Should I skip it? Augment it? What? Personally I'm comfortable with a Reads List that is very comprehensive, but in order to get people to want to read it I think I should put one or two very succinct sentences per each read, and then contain all that wholesome, informational bulk in a neat little spoiler tag to make it convenient on others. What do you think about that guys?<br><br>EDIT: Oh gosh, I just wrote a wall without even being aware of it.  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif\" alt=\":eek:\" title=\"Eek\">"}

But look at the post of mine you're responding to - I've been reaction tested in a multitude of ways by a multitude of players, many of whom are better players than I am.  I walk into reaction tests wondering if that's what is going on.  Coming from that mindset - \"is this a reaction test?\", of course I'm not going to rage at the first sign.  I didn't even begin to steam until you came back to the thread and said it wasn't a gambit.  I could fake-rage, but it would be fake and I'd expect it to come off fake.<br><br>One thing about all those prior reaction tests - I have never automatically turned on the player who tested me.  And the fact that all the way through that, I was maintaining the possibility - in fact the probability - that you were town should indicate to you that while I would have had no respect for way you handled your reaction test, I wasn't going to turn and go after your lynch.<br><br>I don't know what to say.  You claim that you are a logical player.  Even without knowledge of how I play, you had plenty of data in this game thread whereby you could have predicted how I would react if you had called off the gambit.<br><br>What you tried to do failed on so many levels.  And you had only one path through it.  Only one branching.<br><br>I know that you're really upset at how I yelled at you after you claimed doctor.

It was just tough, because between work and the demands of the other players, it made it tough getting around to other things. Basically, pulled in many different directions. Iirc, SG said you can't please everyone, nor should you try, but at least in real-life I try to be as, I'm trying to think of the term, \"socially attractive\" as possible. Also, Day 3, I was prepared to give it my all, and if I somehow managed to reach L-1, I'd at least have a fallback by then claiming Town Shield and making it known that Mr. Fitz never received my protection. I guess I really didn't know Ffery too well, which is why my gut went off the charts in response to her posts. Whenever I'm Scum I'm incredibly reserved, calm, and logical. I saw that in Ffery, and had even noted it in one of my posts about her being like a mirror of myself when I'm Scum (and I've never gotten lynched as Scum.)

This isn't bragging: I'm very intelligent. But, I have difficulty working with people, and am susceptible (it's uncommon as a whole) to treating people who don't think or understand as quickly as I do badly. It's not just about being right, or being REALLY quick at gathering, processing, and applying information. You have to be able to PERSUADE others. And it's not enough to be right. You gotta coax people. Give them some honey. Make 'em laugh a bit. Deprecate yourself humorously some, or pay an honest compliment you might otherwise not have the time to give. I think a lot, very quickly, very deeply, all the time. It's draining. It can and does turn some people off. Intelligence is the acquisition and application of knowledge and skills, but what is it worth in a game based on interaction if you don't have the social art of persuasion?<br><br>There were things in this game that didn't help me help Town, but I could have better controlled my reactions to them. At least look over each post of mine and edit/condense/make it more calm and respectful before posting. The issue with SG, ICE, Reg, and MME criticizing my questions and large posts really angered me, and I wasn't sure whether I should engage them on that, or follow the advice of others and flat-out, completely ignore it while in game. Ignoring it because you are who you are and you cannot possibly please everyone.<br><br>At the moment I DO know that my <span style=\"color: #848482\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Annihilator Beam</span></span> has promise.

And your definition of scummy is off.<br><br>A scummy post is a post that <span style=\"font-style: italic\">looks</span> like it could have been made by a scum-aligned player, it doesn't need to be made by a scum. It's all in the interpretation of the observer, it's all speculation on the side of the observer. You can't define scummy or scumminess based on the alignment of the player, because you don't know the alignment, all you have is a few posts and your observations.</div></blockquote><br><br>I disagree. By that definition, what do you call a post that looks towny on the outside but is scummy on the inside? Given that, and my theory that an alignment influences every single post a player makes, you may be able to at least understand where I'm coming from.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>In this case I did know my own alignment, however, the others didn't and I realized that that one post looked horribly scummy from their perspective. What good would it have done to have ignored that fact and just continue marching to a lynch on me? I had made scummy posts. This does not have anything to do with my alignment.<br><br>You thought I was scum because of that post. There's nothing that shouts towny about that post. You didn't find any (subtle) town hints in that post back then. You might find something townie <span style=\"font-style: italic\">now</span> that you know I was a townie, but not knowing that you couldn't find anything townie about it, so you were sure I was scum. <br><br>Pretty much the definition of scummy right there^</div></blockquote><br><br>\"Scummy\" is a relative word by your definition. It depends on what perspective you're coming from, how you look at it, and the circumstances it's in. Therefore, you can't say objectively that a post was towny or scummy unless you define those words based on the alignment that posted it. If you can see the town hints in a post after the game is over, then they were still there in the first place and one <span style=\"font-style: italic\">could</span> have found them.<br><br>(It was actually not that post, but the fact that you called it scummy and other things that led me to believe you were scum. I didn't see that post as particularly scummy).<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I don't really recall the exact context of this, but I believe it was this:<br>- I was at L-2 with everyone looking my way.<br>- I believed I was going to be lynched at that time.<br>- I knew I made a few scummy posts.<br>- A few days before deadline.<br><br>And then this one guy comes along and calls your post or your behavior townie or good or whatever? Suuurrrree... I now realize how stupid I was to not realize that at that time.</div></blockquote><br><br>As I said before, people can have different opinions on whether a post is scummy. Just because someone reads your post differently doesn't mean they're scum. This may be nitpicky, but if fitz had just said he thought your post was towny, that would not mean he is scum. But there are more clearly defined rules for whether a post is \"good.\" (You articulated well, you put in effort, etc) Therefore, fitz can be scummy for saying your post was good when it wasn't.</div></blockquote>"}
