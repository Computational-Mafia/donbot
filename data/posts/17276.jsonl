If you do not bold your vote, it will not be counted.<br>-Lynching will require a simple majority of votes. Once a player has reached the necessary majority, any attempts to unvote will be unheeded. Feel free to post in twilight, though.<br>-You may not no-lynch.<br>-If a deadline is reached with no majority, the player with the most votes will be lynched. In the event of a tie, whoever has been up longer will be lynched.<br>-The game is not to be discussed outside the thread unless your role specifically states that you may do so.<br>-Once your death scene has been posted, you\u2019re dead. You are allowed only a bah post.<br>-No small or invisible text. Don\u2019t edit/delete previously submitted posts either.<br>-Don\u2019t quote any PMs from me.<br>-I will prod at 48 hours and allow another 48 hours for a response before I seek a replacement.<br>-Please point out any mistakes I make in the thread. In particular, if I post a vote count that does not accurately reflect your vote, it is your responsibility to correct me. If you don\u2019t your vote may be treated as it appears in the vote count.<br>-If you have any questions at all, please PM me or post the question in the thread.<br>-Remember, it\u2019s a game and it\u2019s supposed to be fun. Be nice to your fellow players and your mod. It would be hypocritical of me to be too strict here, but try to keep civil.<br>-Deadlines are set to two weeks. I may extend them at my discretion but don't count on it.<br>-Btw if you didn't notice the title this game is nightless.</div></div></div></span><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Townie Role PM wrote:</cite>You are a townie.

If this explanation and these FACTS, don't suffice for you, please tell me why and what you take issue with. If you keep saying \"You are still scummy, X is a scumtell\", and I'm telling you \"X is not a scumtell\", what can I do? I will be forced to assume you are either a towny who is past willing to listen to logic and will be a liability for us going forward or that you are mafia actively trying to distract town from lynching mafia and lynching me instead. Either way, at that point I have no choice but to vote you and hope you are mafia if you show no signs of reconsidering.<br><br>As for my reads on those voting me:<br><br>Parama, I wrote your aggressiveness off as a town tell yesterday, even as you were pushing and pushing on me for horseshit reasons. I also found your messing around with your random number generator crap, while counterproductive, asinine, retarded, etc., to not be a pure anti-town distraction but some useless filler that you so mightily claim to \"never post\". The more I'm thinking about it though, why do I even think you are town? Looking at the evidence, you claim to be positive I'm scum from the minute I make a post outing a town read I have on Kise, and use my vote on you as a reason to tunnel, tunnel, tunnel. I immediately explained myself in this post: <!-- l --><a class=\"postlink-local\" href=\"http://mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=2981378#p2981378\">viewtopic.php?p=2981378#p2981378</a><!-- l -->, later here: <!-- l --><a class=\"postlink-local\" href=\"http://mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=2991298#p2991298\">viewtopic.php?p=2991298#p2991298</a><!-- l -->, and here: <!-- l --><a class=\"postlink-local\" href=\"http://mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=2991312#p2991312\">viewtopic.php?p=2991312#p2991312</a><!-- l -->.<br><br>Eventually, Trouble makes what appears to be a scumslip, so you even offer an apology: <blockquote><div><cite>Parama wrote:</cite><span class=\"noboldsig\">unvote, vote: Trouble</span><br><br>SCUMHUNTER I'M SORRY.

I found this scummy at the time, but YOUR appeal to emotion got to me. In retrospect, if you were town and really had this read on me that I'm scum, wouldn't you question for a minute this game-altering information that throws your view upside down. Wouldn't you stop to reconsider your entire process thus far this game. Yes, I think you would. You still, even after Trouble has flipped town, have not stopped to reconsider your thought process on why I'm scum, nor even reevaluate your read on me. Why is that? Because you are mafia.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Parama wrote:</cite>Oh hi dram nice of you to ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

I just don't buy it. I don't buy that you are upset that we lynched Trouble. I don't buy that you think a scumslipping townie deserves to die. Or if you do thats even worse. Our job as town is not to say \"that person is scummy, its their fault they were lynched\". Thats a fucking cop out. We fucked up. We lynched Trouble. Me, you, everyone else on that bangwagon is responsible for that vote as much as Trouble is. I do want to review the vote as it happened very fast, but year im rambling now.<br><br> Also, the way you say good day its as if you are done with this day, you are trying to secure another mislynch, and then GO \"GOD DAMN. SCUMHUNTER WAS SO SCUMMY, DESERVED TO DIE.\" Sorry this is one townie you aren't going to fucking mislynch and blame me for. Not for your shitty ass reasons anyway.

If I have offended you I apologize, I try not to take things personal, but I do take mafia games seriously. <br><br>That is why it is frustrating for me though to be voted and honestly not understand why. I feel like you guys are/were voting me based on some formula that people who make jokes/low-content posts are always scum. You weren't (for the most part) even trying to ask me questions, understand what I was thinking or anything, just oh I see someone act a certain way, auto vote. And then I was explaining myself, you are still like oh, herp derp thats still a scum tell. No it isn't not everyone plays the game the same. I like to throw a couple random votes around and OMG WAIT FOR THIS SCUMTELL (I like to buddy fellow players to see how they react). If they are uptight or cautious I then try and judge if they are being srs bizness mafia or careful/paranoid townies. If someone is carelessly throwing their votes away or is easily buddied I try and think if they are bored/lazy town or mafia with their guard down. There are so many ways to interpret any action in a game of mafia that to simplify it to LOL FILLER POST u mafia takes away the fun, the challenge, and the spirit of the game to me.<br><br>LEARN 2 SCUMHUNT. Scumhunting means scumhunting the player more than the scumtells. Scumhunting means looking for towntells.

I'm done with my rant. If you still think I'm mafia go ahead and vote me. If you think I'm a jackass and town that's fine I'll accept that for now too as long as you can get past my douchebagness and try and vote someone you think is mafia.

Quite the opposite really, its focused on lynching me, refusing to even consider for a moment that I am town.

I understand that he is trying to hammer down some solid town reads, but he still needs to contribute. Solidly on my scumdar.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Parama</span> - Has been very active (which I appreciate!), but kinda fishy early on (which I don't!). After split's #202, Parama announces that he's ignoring split for the rest of the game. What? His suspect list in #214 includes split near the top and Reck near the bottom. At the time, neither one had done anything particularly scummy. In #283, he suddenly votes dramonic. I'm not sure what to make of Parama, but he's on my scumdar.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">pycyununn</span> - Has not contributed any actual content. Showed up to vote Caboose, then later to switch to splitfarvle. No explanation on either. I'd mark this as highly suspect, but he's recently been replaced by Slaxx, to whom I guess I should lend the same benefit of the doubt that I'm hoping for.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Scumhunter</span> - His posts have been all over the place, and while he hasn't been the <span style=\"font-style: italic\">best</span> player, he also doesn't seem particularly scummy.

You proceed to disprove yourself by saying posts 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 19, 23 are fluff. That leave 2/3 posts as not-fluff.

The most towny thing to do is to vote as many people as possible day 1 and gather reactions.

I have yet to make a vote that is an actual \"I suspect you as mafia and am going to push on you vote.\" <br><br>To those of you voting me, I'll ask again: Why are you voting me? Are my answers to the questions not making sense? What can I do to prove my towniness?</div></blockquote><br>Okay, so we're supposed to analyze vote patterns and reactions to look over later in the game. And what beautiful analysis has Scumhunter produced? Nothing. Absolutely nothing.<br>Also notice his phrasing: It's the \"most towny\" thing to do, not the \"most beneficial\" or the \"best way to find scum\" or anything like that. This shows that he thinks this is the most towny thing to do, and thus doing it will make him look good. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Scumhunter wrote:</cite>Ha.

Nothing. He cries and cries for reasoning on other people, but doesn't give a shit about providing reasoning who he's voting. He also tries to play off his scummy play with the \"oh, I always get called scum Day 1\" excuse, which doesn't make sense especially because he's been so absolutely appalled with Reck and I for calling him scum. Finally, the bolded makes absolutely no sense, especially since he already figured out there were no nightkills <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2981294#p2981294\" class=\"postlink\">here</a>.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Scumhunter wrote:</cite>LEARN 2 SCUMHUNT.

No, not really.<br>Does scum expect their buddies to save them? Yup.

Top town read with Kise.<br><br>DemonHybrid: Your attack on me for placing RVS votes out of RVS reeks of opportunism. I will admit my play style seems scummy to a lot of people who aren't used to playing with me. And to a point, it is. I vote random people for no good reason, but there is a HUGE difference between placing one vote on someone (for their reaction and the reaction of others) and placing a L-2, L-1, lynch vote on someone. I think people look at how I play and say he's voting so erraticly and randomly he must be scum trying to push any lynch. The fact is I have only pushed one lynch today, xReckoner. All of my other votes were for information, pushing lurkers to vote more, gauging reactions. In short, scumhunting. <br><br>dramonic: Along with splitfarvle you are one of the players who were somewhat in the backseat on the readthrough. <blockquote><div><cite>dramonic wrote:</cite>I'm having a hard time getting a read on Scumhunter.<br>He's playing a pretty terrible game, but actually looks genuinely insulted that his play IS terrible. Genuine...ness, is protown. Terrible play isn't. Mind is blown.<br><br>I'd rather leave him for now and see if we can draw a connection from a flipped scum once we get one. I propose we begin with Split.</div></blockquote><br><br>This post makes me think you are town. Mafia generally don't call town players play \"terrible\". If you were scum, you would be happy with my perceived \"terrible\" play and be pushing on me incessantly and almost brainlessly the way brundibar, nacho, and to a lesser extent actually xReckoner have been.<br><br>Kise: Still my strongest town read. During the reread right after a good post from Caboose you mentioned \"Caboose town\". We have the same pov on a lot of what is going on so far so I have no reason to doubt my early read on you.<br><br>Nachomamma8: your first post from the game that jumped out at me (may be your very first one, in fact it is) <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=2982924#p2982924\">http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopi ... 4#p2982924</a><!-- m -->. Your vote on me seemed so casual, too casual for a town making their first committed vote of the game. I really think you were hopping on the bandwagon on me hoping not to draw too much attention to yourself.  Also your scumhunting question of me \"So you only vote seriously when the day ends?\" was just because you thought it would be easy to attack me for it. Yes, most votes in reality are RVS---&gt;pressure---&gt;bandwagon testing---&gt;Actual lynch votes. What you are missing is that in reality I'm very careful with my vote. While xReckoner at least shows some signs of logic, you really have been tunnel, tunnel, tunnel on me since the start of the game. Also, I think if xReck is town, it would just make me suspect you more. The way you lumped my suspicions on you in with xReckoner seems like me a way to live off of any town cred he gets. He does seem like a competent player and on a readthrough, I am going to withdraw my suspicion on xReck a bit.<br><br>Parama: This sums up my feelings on Parama: <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=2998882#p2998882\">http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopi ... 2#p2998882</a><!-- m -->. I still think he is mafia.<br><br>pycyununn/Slaxx: <blockquote><div><cite>pycyununn wrote:</cite>aaarrrrgghhhh....<br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Caboose</span> <br>i feel sick</div></blockquote><br> This vote is very scummy to me. Can't really ask you to explain Slaxx as you replaced in, but I find this vote odd as Caboose had been very protown to this point.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Slaxx wrote:</cite>Hai Parama, good to know you are town.</div></blockquote><br>You aren't usually as loose with your reads as this. Buddying/defending a scum partner. Have you read the game? Do you really think Parama is town?<br><br>splitfarvle:  @Scumhunter Do you have any scumreads that aren't OMGUS?<br>OMGUS is misused here. \"OMGUS\" is a vote for someone without any logic just because they are voting you. If you read my case on Parama, you will see I suspect him because <br><br>xReckoner: <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=2983917#p2983917...Eh\">http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopi ... 83917...Eh</a><!-- m -->, he states the same 2 town reads I have. Its possible he is just bad and unfamiliar with my play. I'm going to backtrack on my fos on xReckoner to a degree. I had missed some of his posts early on: <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=2981495#p2981495\">http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopi ... 5#p2981495</a><!-- m --> and <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=2981773#p2981773\">http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopi ... 3#p2981773</a><!-- m --> which are reasonably protown. Meh. One of my weaknesses as a player is to be buddied too easily. I tend to play on emotion and instinctively suspect the people who are voting me for shallow reasons and trust the people who defend me against bad cases. I think I made a rash judgment on xReckoner and have tunneled on him a but unfairly. My impression from other people in this game was that xReckoner was an experienced player. As such, I was insulted and thinking WTF that he was voting me so fast day 2. I know that the first time I play with any group of players its a shock when I'm not at L-2 or L-1 day 1. xReckoner, if you read this, I apologize for tunneling on you. If you are mafia you can still fuck off.<br><br><br>Players I'm willing to lynch: (2-3 mafia in here)<br><br>Parama: I had been preoccupied with xReckoner and to a lesser extent Nacho, but my case and feelings toward Parama remain wholly unchanged. His insistence on voting me at the beginning of the day with xReckoner was so incredibly scummy, particularly after apologizing for suspecting me yesterday. He has been noncommittal with his vote and just outright anti-town. At first when he said, \"I'm just going to ignore Scumhunter\" I thought dear god, this has to be a towntell right, would scum really say that? On further consideration, when I look at the evidence as a whole, I have a hard time seeing you as town this game. You were so, so defensive when I mentioned I had a scumtell on you early on. I don't see town getting so worked up about my simple explanation that I disagreed with your Kise vote. Also, you let off the pressue on me once you saw I wasn't getting lynched. Top suspect and who I would very much like to see lynched.<br>Nachomamma8: You have 17 posts this game. 10 of them have had direct attacks on me. Your \"town reads\" are weak and superficial and only came about when a lynch on me obviously wasn't going to happen. You are even attempting to twist my posts before I post! I see you as scum desperate to tunnel on me and having not contributed enough else this game, staying in your comfortable tunnel seemed a viable option as long as you could. You then realized you weren't going to get me lynched so now you are pretending to explore other avenues. xReck as town, you as scum would make perfect sense. You were buddying xReck by lumping my fos of him in with my fos of you in that if he is town and gets town cred for something you can ride on his coattails from it because I had a similar read on you.<br>pycyununn/Slaxx: There is not much to read into pycyununn's play as he made like 3 posts one of them a vote for Caboose. My concern is that when you replaced in you said a \"Scumhunter lynch would give us the most info\". Since when are you even considering lynching for information? I got the feeling that as mafia you would say something exactly like this with the intent of pushing a mislynch and then switching back to me tomorrow. Also, not really a huge fan of either of your votes today (xReck/morgli) and you have proceeded to call Parama town (who really is obv obv scum to me the more I think about him the more I want to vote him). That and the fact you have called me town at times but also said you were considering lynching me for information is very suspicious to me. I would have expected you as town to call me obv town from the minute you replaced in.<br><br><br>Players I probably won't vote for but will go \"meh\" if they are lynched: (1-2 mafia in here)<br><br>Brundibar/Mogri: Initially had in my willing to lynch list with xReck. Part of the problem with people replacing in is that you get off the hook for the person you are replacings scummy behavior. Your reads list is similar to mine except for dramonic and I'm willing to give you the benefit of the doubt for Brundibar's play.<br>DemonHybrid: of note, Demon switches off me and onto Brundibar/Mogri today when I still had a lot of votes on me. If Mogri is town Demon top suspect.<br>Splitfarvle: didn't notice you too much. initially had you in potential scum list but decided to backtrack need to iso you. Not buddies with xReck. Forget why I had this in my notes, but was fairly confident about it.<br>xReck: see my read on him above.<br><br><br>Players I don't want to lynch: (0 mafia in here)<br>Kise: You have been on top of things from the getgo this game. Your suspicion that xReckoner and I could be bussing made me reconsider my case on xReckoner. Granted it probably won't help that I suspect him less than I did before but yea, you are town in my mind.<br>Caboose: I was trying to look back for more evidence that you were town rather than just the 1 post I quoted above. You haven't posted that much this game, but when you have I have followed what you are saying. No reason to doubt you are town.<br>dramonic: Not as strong as my other town reads, but nothing you have done seems off. The one post I noticed from you on my readthrough was a definite town tell."}

I very much believe Nacho is mafia, but you get out of having to follow through on that fos if Mogri flips town like he will like 90% of the time here. Look at Parama (obv scum) saying \"Mogri: reads lists please\" He KNOWS mogri is town and is trying to gain town cred by not being on that wagon and asking for reads. I suppose there is a chance he is mafia and asking his partner for reads before they flip to gain town cred as well, but I find it very unlikely that a mafia was lynched with only 4 votes on a deadlined day with 4 scum alive."}

Id be shocked beyond any explanation if either Nacho or Parama flipped town at this point.  I have had a couple opinions from players I trust on this site who have played in games with Nacho + Parama before. Both said they were competent town players and that Nacho was actually very good as town. If you iso Nacho you will see literally no attempts to scumhunt except for tunneling me. THat would be all well and good as its possible for town to have a misread except if you analyze the rest of Nacho's play you will find no real attempts whatsoever to find my supposed partners. Parama's \"I don't care\" attitude is so ridiculously anti-town that I can't  imagine him ever playing this way as town. I also know enough about Parama from playing with him on epicmafia and asking a few players on this site to know that he takes games serious enough to know to a degree of practical certainty that he would not act the way he has as town. <br><br>Parama, Nacho (2 scum pretty much guaranteed)<br><br>That leaves my meh list from most likely to be scum to least likely to be scum:<br>xReckoner/Peregrine<br>Slaxx (don't know where to place him, conflicting feelings here)<br>Kise<br>dramonic<br>split<br><br>I really thought Caboose was town when he was in the game.

Nacho didn't really comment on anyone besides me though and Dramonic has been lurking. I particularly dislike how fast the wagon has been on him today. My town read on him was because of how he said I was genuinely insulted by being told that my play was terrible. My interpretation of that was he had a good read on me, but then again as scum he would know I'm town and maybe  he wanted to distance himself from Parama + Nacho a bit.   Please explain how Dramonic scum = Parama town. I see no universe in which Parama can be town given his play and if he is town he ACTUALLY deserves to be lynched for his play.  I know I said I didn't believe in that kind of thing, but this game is such an extreme example where I really want to lynch Parama regardless of alignment because he is an anti-town player regardless of alignment. <br><br> If Nacho's posts here are anything other than an honest mistake, then it is not only explicitly against the rules of the game but also certainly against the spirit of the game.

I am willing to answer any question you may have about my play and expect the same commitment to this game and openness. I really don't think its too much to ask. I'd agree that Nacho/Dram lack of even mentioning each other's name EVER is suspect. Nacho didn't give very many reads on anyone other than pushing on me though and Dram has been lurking as of late. So...I don't read too much into lack of interaction because tbh neither has interacted that much with anyone as of late. If anything, I found Parama/Nacho lack of interactions yesterday wayyyy more sketchy because they were both quite active in calling me out but never really interacting with each other from what I recall. <br><br>Oh, and as for wifom not following us into the next day, I'm choosing to just ignore Nacho's comment. Can't let it follow you if you ignore potential wifom.  <br><br>I'd like to hear from dramonic. I see he has been prodded, and I suggest we give him 24 hours to post before we hammer.

Going to do a big reread now.<br><br>Parama: Notice the way he acted with Nacho's lynch \"Nacho is town, Nacho is town, Nacho is town,...I'll vote Nacho so the game can end early\" That doesn't really make sense but Nacho has been terribad all over the place all game and he was confident and showed no reserves about lynching dramonic and peregrine so meh. I'm willing to think he could be town. However, if I do end up getting lynched before Parama, please lynch him because losing to him if he is scum with his terribly anti-town early game I'm going to puke.<br><br>I wish Kise wasn't insta lynched because I would have liked a chance to explain to him why I'm town, but I will respond to his criticisms of me post mortem.<br><br>As for inactivity, Kise (and everyone) needed take a step back and consider what he was saying first. I was literally the only one active (other than slaxx) the day we lynched Nacho and I practically begged all of you to vote with me. Granted 2 scum were QL'd and that's awesome and all and I certainly was willing to be a part of it just not able. Also, despite how good the flips were, it doesn't make quick lynching good play (i.e. Kise was just quicklynched before I even had a chance to respond to his suspicions on me or really reread his posts)<br><br>C-Worl. Your play is just i don't know how to describe it really. It seems like you are trying to assert yourself in a way that makes you \"obv town\" without actually being helpful.<br>Example: <blockquote><div><cite>C-Worl wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Scumhunter wrote:</cite>when we didn't quick lynch obv scum yesterday.</div></blockquote><br><br>No, instead they lynched ACTUAL SCUM yesterday. Are you stupid?</div></blockquote><br><br>It is obvious I know what occurred. You are pointing out in a way that you are trying to discredit me with a personal attack. You have no reason to be hostile like that as town.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>C-Worl wrote:</cite><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: Scumhunter</span><br><br>Over defensive of your buddy much?</div></blockquote><br><br>Please qualify what you mean by overdefensive. I assume you are referring to dramonic who is the only scum I actively was going meh to.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Scumhunter wrote:</cite>Slaxx, I see your point with re: to isos. Nacho didn't really comment on anyone besides me though and Dramonic has been lurking. I particularly dislike how fast the wagon has been on him today. My town read on him was because of how he said I was genuinely insulted by being told that my play was terrible. My interpretation of that was he had a good read on me, but then again as scum he would know I'm town and maybe  he wanted to distance himself from Parama + Nacho a bit.  /quote]<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Scumhunter wrote:</cite>Split, why would you hammer a lurking player over a supposedly competent players such as Parama, who has been so blatantly anti-town? <br><br>I don't get why we are quick lynching or even considering lynching Dramonic for lurking (likely town) when we didn't quick lynch obv scum yesterday. Seriously?  I should be pissed but I can't help but laugh at how bad this game has been.</div></blockquote><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Scumhunter wrote:</cite>C-Worl, I still want the logic and even reads without logic are somewhat helpful. You don't have to present a legal case here, just something other than not mentioning each other's names would be nice.<br><br>And yes, I want you to provide reasons for why you are town. I am willing to answer any question you may have about my play and expect the same commitment to this game and openness. I really don't think its too much to ask. I'd agree that Nacho/Dram lack of even mentioning each other's name EVER is suspect. Nacho didn't give very many reads on anyone other than pushing on me though and Dram has been lurking as of late. So...I don't read too much into lack of interaction because tbh neither has interacted that much with anyone as of late. If anything, I found Parama/Nacho lack of interactions yesterday wayyyy more sketchy because they were both quite active in calling me out but never really interacting with each other from what I recall. <br><br>Oh, and as for wifom not following us into the next day, I'm choosing to just ignore Nacho's comment. Can't let it follow you if you ignore potential wifom.  <br><br>I'd like to hear from dramonic. I see he has been prodded, and I suggest we give him 24 hours to post before we hammer.  Also, for the record, I don't support this lynch, I think he flips town here about 2/3 of the time. <br><br>Oh and slaxx, I think Parama is scum over 90% of the time regardless if Jesus Christ himself flipped scum.</div></blockquote><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Scumhunter wrote:</cite>Why wouldn't 4 townies be voting a 5th townie? Its irrelevant though since Parama is scum, but I don't think that's good logic int he first place. How everyone is not insta voting Parama today is beyond me. Like really really beyond me. He is as obv as nacho, if not more so and I see almost no connection between dramonic's flip and Parama's obvness. <br><br> I'm hardly convinced to follow you Slaxx just because you helped me lynch Nacho and say you have a town read on me. Anything other than your full-fledged support for a Nacho lynch yesterday would have practically confirmed you as mafia to me and we both  know I would have pointed that out in very clear language even if I were lynched. Whether anyone would have listened to me is a whole other question since apparently I'm a huge retard. But yea.<br><br>I'll hammer dramonic tomorrow afternoon if he doesn't post. I'm very much against replacements in general particularly once any game gets past day 2 really so if he is going to end up getting replaced out I'd rather we hammer before that happens.  He has 24 hours from me.</div></blockquote><br><br>These are my posts re: dramonic's lynch. Please point out what about this made you think I would be scum defending a partner? I was thinking through logically if Dramonic could be scum. I had a town read on him, realized it was one thing that could (and was) a null tell. I obviously would have preferred to lynch Parama but that didn't happen so I said I'll hammer him in 24 hours still fully expecting him to flip town. I would have no motivation to defend a partner there as scum. This was the day after Nacho was lynched and I was pretty much obv town to everyone in the game at that point.<br><br><br>As for Kise saying \"Scumhunter is the martyr for Nacho + xReck's town cred\". Hold the fucking phone man lol. Read day 1? I was spamming xReck and Nacho are scum I don't even know how many times. I was doing everything in my power to show how irrational and ridiculous their argument on me was. Also xReck's slot was in full ML ML ML mode from the getgo. First targeting Trouble then me. THINK. THINK. THINK. Please. You may all think oh god Scumhunter didn't VOTE for Reck's slot. But I consider d1 actions way more clearing than all the bandwagoners today. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Scumhunter wrote:</cite>@Reckoner, your last post makes it clear that you are taking no responsibility for my lynch. Paraphrased: \"I don't want to actually scumhunt today. I will let Scumhunter be lynched since its popular opinion and let someone else take the fall when he flips town.\" Who else do you fos besides me? A day 1 lynch counts the same as a lylo lynch, so please don't be as casual with voting off a townie.<br><br>@Nacho, Yes, in reality, I guard my actual vote carefully. I have no problem throwing it around early in the day. But when a wagon gets started, I usually unvote to reconsider, even if I am very sure in my fos on them.<br><br>@Parama, Who else do you fos other than me? If I were to flip town, who would you suspect early tomorrow?</div></blockquote><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Scumhunter wrote:</cite>@Those voting me, I'm not going to complain about the bandwagon on Trouble because that looked like a slip to me too, but if you are willing to automatically believe his slip = me as an automatic town, how strong is your case on me in the first place? Strong enough that 3 of you are voting me instantly without discussion. Great. Seems logical!! Just another witchhunt!! Burn those heathen!! I will not repent for any of my \"sins\" because I haven't done anything wrong. When I flip town, please don't give me any of this \"Scumhunter is bad town shit\" at least take the responsibility on yourself that you are stupid sheep and should go die in a fire somewhere. If any of you voting me currently are town, you deserve to lose so go right ahead.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">vote xReckoner</span><br><br>I'm going with my gut. Anyone wanting to follow a townie feel free.</div></blockquote><br><br>I want to vote xReck early on.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Scumhunter wrote:</cite>Dramonic, you are the one antagonizing me now. I have played hundreds of mafia games both (forum and chatbased) on other sites. I know how to play, my only sin may be that I take the game too seriously at times. I am not actively trying to antagonize anyone. If I have offended you I apologize, I try not to take things personal, but I do take mafia games seriously. <br><br>That is why it is frustrating for me though to be voted and honestly not understand why. I feel like you guys are/were voting me based on some formula that people who make jokes/low-content posts are always scum. You weren't (for the most part) even trying to ask me questions, understand what I was thinking or anything, just oh I see someone act a certain way, auto vote. And then I was explaining myself, you are still like oh, herp derp thats still a scum tell. No it isn't not everyone plays the game the same. I like to throw a couple random votes around and OMG WAIT FOR THIS SCUMTELL (I like to buddy fellow players to see how they react). If they are uptight or cautious I then try and judge if they are being srs bizness mafia or careful/paranoid townies. If someone is carelessly throwing their votes away or is easily buddied I try and think if they are bored/lazy town or mafia with their guard down. There are so many ways to interpret any action in a game of mafia that to simplify it to LOL FILLER POST u mafia takes away the fun, the challenge, and the spirit of the game to me.<br><br>LEARN 2 SCUMHUNT. Scumhunting means scumhunting the player more than the scumtells. Scumhunting means looking for towntells. The fact it took a day phase and a half for anyone to listen to me even though my frustration-filled rage (not to mention voting patterns) should have made it clear as soon as there were 4 quick votes on me d1 that I was town. <br><br>But ok. I'm done with my rant. If you still think I'm mafia go ahead and vote me. If you think I'm a jackass and town that's fine I'll accept that for now too as long as you can get past my douchebagness and try and vote someone you think is mafia. I'm going to take a break from this game for a day, take a chill pill, and gather more of my thoughts.</div></blockquote><br><br>Appealing directly to dramonic to consider I'm town. This is not how mafia partners interact.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Scumhunter wrote:</cite>Well, xReckoner, the reason I suspect you is ironically enough your lack of emotion. You are talking to the rest of the players in this game as if my mafianess is so obvious to you that you don't even need to take the time to question my intent. I am more than just a slot in this game you know. Behind my rage filled posts I am a human being, whose words, attitude, mindframe mean something, something very telling about my alignment. Why aren't you trying to read into that at all?</div></blockquote><br><br>Further questioning and scumhunting of xReckoner from d1.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Scumhunter wrote:</cite>@Nacho, in regards to your synopsis of my posts \"appeal to emotion\", \"appeal to fear\", etc.<br><br>You are posting all of that with a pre-conceived notion that I'm scum.  Take a step back please, read what I wrote from the perspective that I'm town (even if you don't believe it). Then, can't all those very same posts be towntells about my frustration with the game and no one listening to me? They certainly can. Now, tell me why you feel why I am being insincere.<br><br>The one thing that makes forum mafia so much more difficult than other forms of the game (particularly as town) is that when you get in that tunnel its harder to escape.<br><br>Labeling something as an appeal to emotion as a reason to completely throw out its validity is absurd. It means something.</div></blockquote><br><br>Asking Nacho to reconsider my alignment. Trying to prove my towniness to him.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Scumhunter wrote:</cite>^^ This guy needs more votes.</div></blockquote><br>Trying to get more people to vote xReck d1.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Scumhunter wrote:</cite>Ha. C'mon people. OPEN YOUR EYES. What kind of townie doesn't even try to convince the person voting them that they are town?</div></blockquote><br><br>Further pushing on xReck.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Scumhunter wrote:</cite>So you are 100% confident I flip scum then? Lmfao. <br><br>You do realize that the case on me was incredibly weak and based on null-tells from me from RVS stage right?<br><br>You are scum who thought there was enough of a wagon on me that you got in the mind frame you were going to lynch me today no matter what. Now when there is some resistance to that plan you aren't able to adjust in time to think about how ridiculous and irrational you are being. Time for the rope.<br>/quote]<br><br>Explaining why xReck's case on me sucked.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Scumhunter wrote:</cite>To explain why my gut on Parama says town:  I interpret his lack of desire to scumhunt as true ambivalence. He either ACTUALLY doesn't care to scumhunt or he is too lazy to do so. Not great town play, but his tunneling on me I never really interpreted as one with a mafia agenda behind it.<br><br>Now In contrast, xReckoner and Nachomamma have been focused on the one goal of getting me lynched with nearly every post that they make. It's not a \"relaxed\" mindframe as they want us to believe. From my point of view of being under constant attack for most of the day, their behavior is not lazy or ambivalent at all. Quite the opposite really, its focused on lynching me, refusing to even consider for a moment that I am town. Those actions SCREAM mafia to me, but unfortunately the only other person to have really picked up on it to this point is Kise. I really feel that xReckoner and Nacho thought that I would be an easy mislynch to just tunnel on and that the town would go along with with no thought. And to effect, they were right. I had what 5 votes within 1.5 pages of the beginning of day 2 here.</div></blockquote></div></blockquote></div></blockquote><br><br>Might be my best post of the game especially if Parama actually is town. The only reason I'm thinking that Parama could be town now, is that for mafia to bus down to the only mafia left makes me think that the last scum thinks they are in a really good spot right now. Parama would have known as scum that I wasn't going to back off him one bit. There was no indication to him that even lynching 2 of his partners would have gotten me not to vote him or to leave instructions to vote him if I were lynched first. For those reasons, Parama actually may be town. Sickening to say, but its possibly and actually probably true. -___-<br><br>So that gets me thinking...Who is scum then? Slaxx going V/LA and saying \"Please don't QL\" while im gone sends off alarm signals in my mind. For slaxx scum, I am his biggest threat 1. because I know his tendency to bus hard and 2. i've never really trusted him this game. The best thing for him as scum would be a QL on me and there is no reason to think that another QL wouldn't happen given the uptick in activity right now. He also conveniently moved me up to #2 on his scum list before going V/LA when earlier he had said many times that I was obv town. ALso I know slaxx from off-site and he knows I started a new job this week so he would know better than to interpret my lesser activity (not even going to say lurking because its not fair) the last day or two as scummy. I'd really like him to explain why I'm his #2 scum read right now. Seems like he's trying to \"sign off\" on oking a lynch for me counting on the obvious impatience of this game lately to lynch me without actually voting me.<br><br>I've spent most of my post trying to show how I really am obv town and I need some time to really think about who the last scum could be. Right now my top suspect is Slaxx. I also need to look over DemonHybrid and C-Worl more. I'd be surprised if split was scum and as much as it really really sickens me to say it I don't think Parama is scum at the moment. I just noticed before I posted that Kise hasn't officially flipped town but it seems obvious its not gg atm. So Kise if you read this please feel free to ask any other questions. Particularly it would be helpful to further explain your suspicions re: my interactions with the 3 lynched scum and how you view them as making me mafia whatsoever. Thanks.<br><br>I would agree there was serious bussing in this game. Mafia has to have brass balls to vote for all their partners down to just themselves left. For that reason, i think I said this before but i can't find it in this post, that mafia thinks they are in a really good spot.  Also, I need to reread people's opinions with re: to Parama and me.  As I now think Parama is probably town (bad town, but town nonetheless) mafia likely wanted to keep us both alive as long as they could to tear the game apart.  I will try and see if slaxx can post in thread before really going \"V/LA\""}

I mean you are wrong, but I can see where your argument comes from at least.<br><br>To tell you what I make of Nacho's behavior towards me: I know I'm an abrasive player. I piss people often. for example DemonHybrid is mad at me in another game because I was fucking around and semi-trolling. I can't count the number of games that scum zone in on me for a ML d1 it happens probably over 50% of my games I'm in overall that I'm at L-1 or L-2 d1 and probably like over 80% of my town games with scum invariably leading the charge (sometimes with town support).  Mafia make themselves obv to me by refusing to backdown on trying to get me ML'd even when support wanes. They are annoyed by my angry, spewy, emotional posts which essentially serve to make me obv town.  They rage that I town tell despite my \"tells\" that would ordinarily be used to prove scum. It is literally enraging for mafia. I find it amusing. I'm also fairly ok at bringing myself to the brink of being lynched d1 and still being able to use that experience to generate strong reads on players and eventually not get lynched. Meh, its a unique strategy and I mean I don't intentionally get myself put to L-1 d1 it just often happens that way with the low-content shit I post early and the stances I take.<br><br>To give you an idea of my scum meta: I lurk, I don't provide content, and I certainly dont interact with my partners the way I have interacted with the lynched scum so far. Overall, I play a bad mafia game. My name is scumhunter for a reason. I much much much prefer to be town. Scum get mad that they can't get a player who is doing all the cookie cutter tells: \"Appealing to emotion, reacting irrationally sometimes, posting off-content stuff, overall being an ass\" to be lynched. Scum tend to tunnel me and refuse to unvote because they get so frustrated with my town play. In retrospect that may be why xReckoner replaced out and completely describes Nacho's downfall this game. I totally get where you are coming from with the interactions appearing to be scummy but the way I interact with people is completely different from most people and I'd ask you to consider that. I can't speak for their actions so I can speak for mine which have been blatantly protown (consistent with my town play and inconsistent with my mafia play) throughout the game. Also, dramonic saying he had a null read on me was I think to avoid having to take a stance on my alignment. Scum hate to take a stance on players who are capable of being as destructive of a force as I can be.  He also could have been attempting to buddy me without really trying to stop suspicion on me. I did call dramonic town and I'm sure he needed my support which would explain why he didn't want to fos me but didn't want to defend me either becuase he needed me tunneling on Parama. My brain tells me Parama is town. Typed that to remind myself. I need to remind myself that."}

I literally could not post more than a few sentences at work most days and if you observe my play in any game I'm in I never never never like to quick lynch. I stated I was willing to hammer dram if he didn't post because I realized my big town tell on him was really a null tell and I didn't want to deal with a replacement coming in at this phase. I was pleasantly surprised that he flipped scum. My hesitatino to vote Dramonic is in fact a town tell. I have said this before but there would be no reason to shitty half-defend a partner there. I'd either take a stance that he's town and I don't wnat to lynch him or just bus him at that point especially when he's so inactive instead of needlessly drawing attention to myself. My actions with regards to Dramonic's lynch are the last thing I would do  as scum and I'm not claiming to be a great player as scum, but cmon man. The reason I would never take that sort of stance is precisely because bad players like you would view it as scum play."}

I'm telling you I would have no motivation to act that way with the dram lynch as scum. I can't think of one possible benefit to me acting that way as scum. In theory my partner still would have been lynched and all I would have done is incriminate myself. if you actually think im that bad and continue to vote me i will take it personally and vote you. god this is me trying to be nice. i have issues."}

I stated my intentions very clearly the entire day. I reinforced that my intial read on dramonic was a town read (consistent with my read on him all game) that I wasn't comfortable with a quick hammer and that I needed to reread (consistent with my actions). I then was able to quickly iso him a bit and mentioned that the strong town tell I had on dram could actually be a null tell (consistent with rereading and providing reads). I then said I was willing to give him 24 hours to post and that I wouldn't hammer until then which I followed through on as the hammer happened before that. Those actions were clear, consistent, following what I told you all I was doing and I followed through on what I said.  The only thing I can think of is that you are picking up on my cautiousness in lynching in general and my uncertainty of dramonic's alignment. As for that, I am cautious and I was uncertain of his alignment."}

This is my list of most likely to be scum to least likely:<br><br>1. Slaxx<br>2. Parama/Split (undecided who to rank higher)<br>3. Demon<br><br>Slaxx still needs to explain why he effectively said \"Don't quick lynch while I'm gone, I'm going to move SH up to #2 on my fos list though\". He's more aware than to post something like that so if he comes back and says \"I didn't think you were going to get lynched while I was V/LA\" I'm going to have to call bs It's even scummier because he called me obv town up until the time when he goes V/LA and it looks like I'm next to be lynched so he conveniently moves me up his scum list at that point. You can't be V/LA forever slaxx &lt;3.<br><br>I have reasons to suspect Parama and Split. Parama has been all over the place with his opinion of me. One minute I'm scum the next he's saying im obv town. Its such a large shift in opinion on someone to happen so fast. He also seems willing to lynch pretty much anyone most of the time. Not sure he would be as blatant with his thirst to lynch as scum though.<br><br>Split. The way I feel on split is that for a while I had a similar read on him to dramonic. He wasn't posting much but when he did he was generally voting Nacho and not me so I didn't really look at him that closely.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>splitfarvle wrote:</cite><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Nachomamma8</span><br>If Nacho is scum: he's attempted to gain cred by opposing the brundibar/Mogri wagon. Since he's looking for cred with this read, he's likely looking for cred with his other strong read as well by bussing his buddy. Nacho scum = Scumhunter scum.</div></blockquote><br><br>This is before Nacho even flipped. You were trying to make an implication that Nacho scum = Me scum. I mean I think Nacho and me is/was probably one of the unlikeliest combinations in the game from a town pov at that time.  <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>splitfarvle wrote:</cite>:<br><blockquote><div><cite>xRECKONERx wrote:</cite>Kise is literally trying to line up a mislynch on me and Nachomamma8, then bus his own buddy.</div></blockquote><br> Reck tries to link SH's flip to Kise. </div></blockquote><br><br>I agree Reck was trying to link me to Kise. How does that make you suspect me though? Kise was one of the only players day 1 who agreed with me with regards to Reck scum.  xReck is confirmed mafia and Kise is confirmed town....soo...yes xReck was trying to make my town flip clear Kise? Don't really follow. xReckoner was trying to discredit the only two people onto him by lumping Kise and I together as scumbuddies to drown out the opposition. These two posts make me go ???. I mean  if you look at it your behavior is very similar to xReck's trying to make strange scum partnerships where they don't exist!<br><br>As for Demon, I iso'd him carefully just now. He's my strongest town read and the only person I probably won't be willing to vote today. At first glance I took his \"SH and Parama are obv town\" comment as a huge town tell because I can't see any scum wanting to say two people are obv town at this juncture. That town tell loses a bit of its validity due to the fact that its me and Parama in this game particularly given that I've said repeatedly that nothing would be more devastating to me than a Parama scum win.  I took what he said at facevalue though and I think he does think Parama and I are obv town. Earlier I thought Demon was scummy for voting me and fosing me at various junctures. When I review it though I interpret his actions as an honest attempt to find scum throughout the game. The times he voted me were somewhat legitimate (my random voting d1 since he was not familiar with my playstyle), (voting me for saying lynch Nacho then lynch me practically immediately after I said I was open to Nacho being town: I definitely didn't communicate my intentions well there).  At critical junctures though he unvoted me, voted nacho, was supporting the other scum lynches and generally  has been willing to listen to what I say even if he disagrees with how I play."}

I also don't like how Peregrine refused to comment on Nacho Vs. You.<br>--Why did you move me from obv town to scum suspect with no explanation and then try to criticize me for posting my thought process and reconsidering reads when you are being way more inconsistent and illogical??<br>...First of all, that is a loaded question.

My lynch is inevitable unless I find scum before then.<br>-Why are you bringing up shitty points on me now? <br>...Because I'm off my V/la. And they arent shitty.<br>-Why do you act like you care one minute and then not care the next?<br>...Because anger got a hold of me.
