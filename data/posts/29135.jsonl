Modified somewhat by me.<br>\n--Big overall stuff<br>\n1) The site-wide rules apply, please read them and don't do anything stupid.<br>\n2) Unless it is explicitly stated in your role PM that you can do so, do not talk about this game outside of the game thread.<br>\n3) Do not quote any communication you have with me, the moderator of the game. Depending on the circumstance, you may be able to paraphrase things I have sent you (such as a role PM). Use common sense and if you are unsure feel free to ask me via PM. Trying to use timestamps of PMs to try to discover alignments will get you modkilled, as will posting any quicktopic you may have or copy+pasting from it.<br>\n4) Don't be a dick.<br>\n5) A modkill will occur if a player has broken a rule that compromises the integrity of the game or blatantly breaks rules despite warnings. I will kill you, change your alignment to Neutral Survivor, and take the day to night. The only exception is if a member of the mafia intentionally tries to get himself modkilled to help his faction by taking the game to night- this will keep the game at day.<br>\n6) Play to achieve your win condition.<br>\n7) I reserve the right to forcibly replace players if their rule infractions indicate they should no longer play the game but aren't severe enough to be killed. <br>\n<br>\n--Voting, Lynching, and deaths<br>\n8) The following voting formats are acceptable: <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">vote: ac1983fan, Vote: ac1983fan</div>, <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: ac1983fan</span>. Abbreviations and misspellings are okay too, so long as I can figure out who you're voting. If it's at all ambiguous it will not be counted.<br>\n9) Unvotes aren't necessary when changing votes, but are nice. They can also be used to remove your vote from wherever it currently is.<br>\n10) I will try to post one vote count every day, with more if necessary because of a lot of vote changes. If you want an extra one ask for it and I'll be happy to give you one. If one is wrong point it out in-thread and I'll correct it as soon as possible. <br>\n11) A lynch will occur when a player achieves 50% +1 of the votes. When this has happened, any subsequent votes and unvotes will not be counted, and the game will enter twilight. Night will begin as soon as I have declared the lynch.<br>\n12) You may vote for a no lynch if desired. If a majority of the players in the game vote for a no lynch, the game will progress to night without a lynch.<br>\n13) Once you're dead, you are dead. Do not post in the thread until the game is over, except for one contentless \"bah\" post. It must be made relatively soon after your death.<br>\n<br>\n--Activity &amp; Deadlines<br>\n14) Try to stay active- if you can no longer keep up with the thread due to real life issues send me a PM and I'll begin looking for a replacement.<br>\n15) Prods will be issued after 72 hours without posting. If you're due for your 3rd or higher numbered prod and you've received at least one prod in the current or previous game day I'll replace you instead. Players may request a prod on another player too if I forget or you want it done faster than the regular votecount.<br>\n15a) If you do not post in thread within 48 hours of being sent a prod, I will begin searching for a replacement.<br>\n16) Things come up in life, if you need time off for something, please let myself and the players know in-thread for V/LA purposes. I will be flexible, but if you can't be here for a significant amount of time I will replace you.<br>\n16a) I will permit a temporary replacement if you will be gone for a period of longer than 1.5 weeks, but you must find your own replacement.<br>\n17) Deadlines for each game day will be 2 weeks.<br>\n17a) Day 1's deadline will be 3 weeks from the start of the confirmation phase.<br>\n18) In the event of a deadline being reached without a player gaining a majority of votes, there will no lynch.<br>\n19) Nights will have a 2 and a half day (60 hour) deadline. If you fail to send in a night choice, you will automatically default to 'no choice' for that night, and you will do nothing. You may send in an action in advance if you think you won't be there for the actual night period. The night scene may not exactly be up after 60 hours, but give or take an hour or 10 and it will be.<br>\n20) Deadlines may be extended if multiple players are on V/LA over the time deadline would expire or replacements have been needed throughout the day or in other circumstances. They will not be extended if nobody is posting or for other similar reasons.<br>\n<br>\n--Other Stuff<br>\n21) I call dibs on<div style=\"display:inline;color:#BF00BF\"> purple </div>font. Don't use it.<br>\n22) It's more than possible I've missed a rule or haven't completely covered something. Don't try to exploit it, or you will be modkilled. <br>\n23) I reserve the right to add more, or modify existing rules at any time. If this happens, I will let everyone know.<br>\n24) Flavour in any modscenes is only flavor. It will not give insights to the alignments of any player in them and you can understand all of the mod-info from the deaths below any flavor that is given.<br>\n25) Don't use codes or cryptography to gain an advantage for massclaims or other situations. Using size tags or other BBCode to hide things is also not allowed. As an exception you May use breadcrumbs or other simple methods of hiding information that use small changes or indications in otherwise regular posts. If you've got a question about what's acceptable PM me before using it.<br>\n26) If you don't agree to follow these rules then send me a PM before the game starts and I'll find a replacement for you. <br>\n27) Have fun, and DFTBA!", "time": "Tue Jun 11, 2013 2:40 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=29135&start=0", "forum": "53", "thread": "29135"}

RVS-based lynch, even if you lynch a mafia, which would be super-awesome, won't give you any granted info, if any, on loyalties and whatnot.

Why are you so eager to lynch me, so early in the game, if your point of view regarding the pros of RVS is the acquisition of info? Lynching me now would prevent you from acquiring more info regarding those loyalties that you mention and other stuffs. A mislynch on d1 is NOT better, IN MY OPINION, because I much rather, as I said, analyze the kill's info based on day behaviour that analyzing day behaviour that's ultimately based on sheer randomness, because that way we'll have one dead Townie rather than two. And that's always preferrable.<br>\n<br>\nNow I'm gonna say this again, in case I wasn't clear. This is how I see this game, and this is what I think to be the best strategy. It's not a play like Grimgroove just postulated. I believe in Day 1 no-lynch, because of what I explained above.<br>\n<br>\nNow, I'm reeeaaaallly keen on hearing from you again, Baezu, to answer these simple questions:<br>\n- If you want reactions to see the smoke comin' out of the scumhole, why lynch me right away? Why not wait a little longer, say two weeks?<br>\n- Do you think mafia loyalties would be made explicit by them in day 1 in such a way as to tell us who's who?

Theoretically nolynching there D1 gives the PR's an extra night while making the odds as low as possible for scum to shoot the PR's N1. This means that you have more information for the first lynch which would be on D2. Now the scum will mostly kill the stronger townies on the N1 this actually will balance the information gain from PR's slightly. The information gained from NK analysis is well... its actually GOOD when you have a lot of meta on everyone in the game but in a game with this playerlist (-1)? wouldn't do much at all.

That's all relative, tho, given that you're taking it as granted that the info from N1 would be completely useless, which I don't think to be the case. Ever. After the reactions from the RVS it is infinitely better (IMO, again) to analyze the info from the N1 kill choice than to rather lynch randomly on Day 1. Cuz that's what we'll be doing, unless Baezu is the most obvious scummyman on the website, and his scummates are not smarter than him. As I've said, I've played scum a couple o'times and L1 is most often a mislynch that leads nowhere, because scummies will know how to cover it up by killing off the right player. See what I mean? <br>\n<br>\nDay 1 -&gt; Mislynch :: Night 1 -&gt; Scummies will cover it up pretty well given the Day 1 BW's and whatnot, which leads to Day 2 -&gt; Mislynch again, which leads to Night 2 -&gt; ANOTHER dead townie. HOPEFULLY, no important informative PR's will be killed and they'll have enough tells to start pointing fingers at actual scumpeople in a way that puts the rest of the Townies behind the bandwagon. <br>\n<br>\nThis is how things mostly went off-site. I'm not very sure about this one in specific, but I rather not play with these odds. Ofc, what's above is not written in stone, but odds point to that.

During the night, the mafia have to act together. They choose as a team which player's interactions get analyzed. If someone is fingering the entire mafia team, they may leave them alive over the player that has fingered all civs to try and get mislynches. They may do the opposite for supreme WIFOM. During the day, mafia can deliberately not interact or choose to interact in certain ways to deceive. If a mafia gets pegged, then they can dig to keep suspicion away from any teammates.

During the night, the mafia have to act together. They choose as a team which player's interactions get analyzed. If someone is fingering the entire mafia team, they may leave them alive over the player that has fingered all civs to try and get mislynches. They may do the opposite for supreme WIFOM. During the day, mafia can deliberately not interact or choose to interact in certain ways to deceive. If a mafia gets pegged, then they can dig to keep suspicion away from any teammates.</div></blockquote>\nIn a 100% ideal world I would agree with this. If, theoretically, the mafia played perfectly this would be 100% true. Unfortunately that is not the case. However, you are assuming that scum never make mistakes and that scum won't counter claim or try to deceive us with fake night actions. You underestimate the wifom that the scum can put on us with their night actions... pleased don't tell me you are an em tard too. \n</div></blockquote>\n\nNope, not from EM. But counterclaims yield a mafia member nearly 100% of the time. If we are claiming in a lylo situation, then the game is pretty much a 50-50 RNG at that point. As for fake night actions, unless I'm mistaken, mafia make kills each night. If that's not the case and they can no kill, then my previous statement starts to lose water. I fully understand that mafia WIFOMs plenty, but at the end of the day (or in this case, night), someone is killed, and the town gets to analyze. If it was a WIFOM and the night kill was a decoy, then the next lynch/night kill should reveal that. <br>\n<br>\nAnd if scum make mistakes, then it doesn't matter if we lynch or not.

While I mentioned that gut off-ness about BP's posts, I completely disagree with Red Dragon and Baezu here. I really, really don't think BP's wanting to NL is indicative of his alignment either way; I haven't gone through his other games (if he has any) but his convictions here make it seem like an idea he stands by as town and one he would present as part of a town meta if he was scum. I don't think being difficult regarding mathematical logic is a scumtell. In fact, I'd expect scum to be even more flip-floppy than town in this case; scum loves to appease the town. <br>\n<br>\nAnother thing scum love to do is go after easy lynches, especially with new(ish) players like BP who do something like he's doing right now.

During the night, the mafia have to act together. They choose as a team which player's interactions get analyzed. If someone is fingering the entire mafia team, they may leave them alive over the player that has fingered all civs to try and get mislynches. They may do the opposite for supreme WIFOM. During the day, mafia can deliberately not interact or choose to interact in certain ways to deceive. If a mafia gets pegged, then they can dig to keep suspicion away from any teammates. A night kill has no deception; that player is killed.

I fully understand that mafia WIFOMs plenty, but at the end of the day (or in this case, night), someone is killed, and the town gets to analyze.

Just because someone defends someone you think is scum doesn't make them scum as well. You read people too superficially, like \"A is probably scum.

I just wanna say that a no-lynch won't obviously occur, so don't be surprised if further ahead I vote for a lynch. I just think that at the time, we didn't have enough juice to get it started. And we do now.<br>\n<br>\nSo it appears that the general conclusions we've come to is that Future, thegooner and meself are the one with the most fingers pointed at. Given how dispersed are the actual votes (which I was surprised to see), I'm gonna start bandwagoning to put them under pressure.

Everything else was shaky foundations for that theory: see posts <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5030118#p5030118\" class=\"postlink\">#74</a> and <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5030369#p5030369\" class=\"postlink\">#85</a> specifically. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\nBut then, his eagerness is the thing that throws me off the most, because I'm still not sure whether it's genuine town behaviour, or scum attempts at lynching.<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5027189#p5027189\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5027189#p5027189\" data-post-id=\"5027189\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 45</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=21643\">Baezu</a> wrote:</cite>We need to lynch this now!</div></blockquote>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5030118#p5030118\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5030118#p5030118\" data-post-id=\"5030118\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 74</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=21643\">Baezu</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5028491#p5028491\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5028491#p5028491\" data-post-id=\"5028491\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 49</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=18397\">BP</a> wrote:</cite>- If you want reactions to see the smoke comin' out of the scumhole, why lynch me right away?

Why would we need to wait to lynch you? You're being overly defensive, you're not scumhunting and you're not really helping town.

No problem w/ early lynching (which was more based on gut feeling that anything else), but says that ML is good because of bandwagon- and convo-drawn info. If you don't give it enough time for those BW to arise, and buddies to pair themselves up, then no point in ML.<br>\n<br>\nThen he shifts to Future for no apparent reason:<br>\nGrimgroove posts from #87 until #92 in a row. This is when future-as-scum theory is presented. Then some posts about game theory again, RedDragon's case on me, and general chitchat. Post #100 is Baezu's <blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I'll have more to say about future once I hear his response to your questions. On the surface I don't feel like the evidence is undeniable - it's more \"gut\"ly.

Future himself, as Baezu was waiting him to, didn't post at all. Right before Future's mod-edited post (WTF), Baezu tells us that he is\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>starting to agree with people on the future case. Still think BP is scummier so I'm keeping my vote on him for now. I would be willing to hammer future if it comes to that.<br>\n<br>\nFoS future</div></blockquote>\n\nAgain, no one had said anything about that. But Baezu can't wait to get to the lynch.

It's a combination of all CAPS words, frustration, and also some semi-surrendering (\"I will just have to wait for the mafia to NK me n1 to show you my role PM\"). In my experience, bringing up PM info to avoid being lynched is usually scummy. Also, in a 13 man game where the pool is already small, why not just shut up and die? Why fight so hard on Day 1 to not be lynched? Usually if I'm civ and getting  FOS'd by people early in games, I put my head down and work twice as hard to find mafia. It does no good to overly defend early in games because that's what mafia wants. The longer a round goes with suspicion and discussions pointed towards a civ, the easier it is for mafia to hide. A civ death can be extremely helpful for civs in the long run.<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Baezu</span>", "time": "Sun Jun 16, 2013 5:17 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=29135&start=150", "forum": "53", "thread": "29135"}

NL day 1 is a horrible idea for reasons already explained (we lose a lynch, flip, chance at hitting scum, etc.).

People don't post nearly as often as expected. Be that as it may, lynching because the game is stalled is silly, at best! We must lynch scum, and even tho Future's absence is scummy at the very least, to hurry-lynch him because the game is kinda stalled is NOT the way to go. Grim's one of the towniest reads I have, but this that he suggested is not proper town behavior. If Future turns out to be innocent... It's bad for everyone, even if we lose a player that wasn't as active as he should be.", "time": "Wed Jun 19, 2013 2:54 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=29135&start=225", "forum": "53", "thread": "29135"}

It's a combination of all CAPS words, frustration, and also some semi-surrendering (\"I will just have to wait for the mafia to NK me n1 to show you my role PM\"). In my experience, bringing up PM info to avoid being lynched is usually scummy. Also, in a 13 man game where the pool is already small, why not just shut up and die? Why fight so hard on Day 1 to not be lynched? Usually if I'm civ and getting  FOS'd by people early in games, I put my head down and work twice as hard to find mafia. It does no good to overly defend early in games because that's what mafia wants. The longer a round goes with suspicion and discussions pointed towards a civ, the easier it is for mafia to hide. A civ death can be extremely helpful for civs in the long run.<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Baezu</span></div></blockquote>\nI feel like you aren't interacting with anyone in this game.

During the night, the mafia have to act together. They choose as a team which player's interactions get analyzed. If someone is fingering the entire mafia team, they may leave them alive over the player that has fingered all civs to try and get mislynches. They may do the opposite for supreme WIFOM. During the day, mafia can deliberately not interact or choose to interact in certain ways to deceive. If a mafia gets pegged, then they can dig to keep suspicion away from any teammates. A night kill has no deception; that player is killed. No matter what, that player is getting analyzed the next day, and the lynch that follows generally reveals why mafia made that night hit.<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: Elyse</span><br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Grimgroove</span><br>\n<br>\nMy vote for Elyse was because I didn't realize the RVS had ended.</div></blockquote>\nSo this whole post is about Theory its such an inconsequential thing from Grim but Gooner votes him over it because he disagrees.<br>\n<br>\nNow, at this point in the game BP No Lynch stuff had just begun, he completely ignored that, COMPLETELY.

But counterclaims yield a mafia member nearly 100% of the time. If we are claiming in a lylo situation, then the game is pretty much a 50-50 RNG at that point.

I fully understand that mafia WIFOMs plenty, but at the end of the day (or in this case, night), someone is killed, and the town gets to analyze. If it was a WIFOM and the night kill was a decoy, then the next lynch/night kill should reveal that. <br>\n<br>\nAnd if scum make mistakes, then it doesn't matter if we lynch or not.

Thus the points given at the beginning of the post should reflect the players views with the latter examination and links demonstrating specific reasons.  With that in mind, Ztife should be shown as NachoPops strongest town read and NachoMa as definitive scum.<br>\n<br>\nThis does not happen.  If we examine the first point of NachoPops' analysis we see that the individual thinks poorly of sheeping, however they mark it as their single strongest reason for a town read on myself in the quoted post above.  They complain about both inactivity and the speed of trains and their formation which are general complaints.  <br>\n<br>\nThe player does list their three scumreads as Grim, BP, and NachoMa respectively, but holds really positive vibes for myself who is also at -1 with the other two and RD who is appropriately at +1.  They then mention someone who does not exist (chery) and indicate that they feel slightly positive about Sal who is listed as the same rank as RD.  Elyse, also a +1 is called null.  <br>\n<br>\nPast this point Sunny, Pere, and Ztife are counted as null when Ztife is the strongest town read and Sunny/Pere are +-1 respectively.  Red dragon is defended again, making this post a sort of RD defense sandwich.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nBased on this analysis I would say that Nacho is town attempting to catch up and a bit scatterbrained on his/her considerations.  However, I think that if RD flips mafia then this entire line of reasoning and the redundant defense can be appraised in a new light.", "time": "Tue Jun 25, 2013 5:43 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=29135&start=375", "forum": "53", "thread": "29135"}

However, for reference, you should have included SunnyDays' post as well. <br>\n<br>\nThe way SunnyDays came in wasn't exactly according to the book and left much open for interpretation. I could see Red Dragon interpreting this as a poor fakeclaim, simply because I did as well at first.

The whole line of reasoning being: I wouldn't do this if I was scum because scum values their life more, because townie self votes are a sign of frustration with the game in general, because it is counter intuitive to help kill yourself where you desire life.  It is a play off of Ocham's Razor and thus has been so commonly picked up on that where it was initially a town tell it is now a slight scum tell (in my eyes at least) because of how easily it can diffuse a situation.<br>\n<br>\nI wouldn't give it a 5:1 ratio, but from what I have seen it is probably a 2:1 and combined with his play it works to what I already suspect.  <br>\n<br>\nBeyond that, the amusing way that he tried to twist it by saying that I am absolving myself with it was pitifully scummy because it shows disparity between his self vote and his interest in self preservation, thus revealing that he does not want to die at all.  &lt;--- This + Play + Attitude = Scum.<br>\n<br>\nFurther, town PR's never self vote.  Never.

It initiates discussion. It seems like there is a part of him that obviously is saying \"PLEASE SPARE ME, I WANT PITY\", and then there's this part saying \"FORGET YOU ALL, IMA DO WHATEVER THE HELL I WANT, WATCH ME DIE\" and it just isn't a pleasant thing to watch. Yeah, you know, I honestly don't know how to read this kind of pathos, although I've said repeatedly I still think Red Dragon is town. What's Ocham's Razor? I'll go look it up. I feel like RD is trying to make points about others still. The redeeming/positive thing that I still like about him is that he is still fighting to stay alive, despite the BS he is talking about \"I'm gonna die, watch me, I won't remove my vote\" stuff. He's still continuing to do his own thing, making his own points. He didn't just say DAMN YOU ALL I'M LEAVING. That's the redeeming thing I see in all of this.<br>\n<br>\n- Sunny days your #415 point is great too. My feedback for #415 is that this kind of paranoia with \"I think you're bluffing\" is a pretty strong/bold statement to make so I don't see it as necessarily scummy.

Stop trying to weasel your way out, it just spreads seeds in my mind that you're not giving it your all - which is disappointing - or that you're just really scummy trying to skate by. I don't really know what to think with you, ya know. <br>\n<br>\nGrimgroove I liked your opening posts a lot better than your second half of the game. You were leaning town in the early stages, but no it doesn't offset the middle/later stages of the game so far where I didn't like you much. Darthe, I left out one of your posts in my observations because I felt you were just trying to get reactions by saying \"willing to hammer\" on one of those pages. Whoever said they were willing to hammer on page 5 (not you) first - Baezu - was really scummy for doing so, but it's really hard to tell in those slightly past RVS stages but not quite. Swearing town isn't cool either. It just looks really sketchy. <br>\n<br>\nZtife seemed really inquisitive and it was a genuine curiosity to me - that's how it came off to me in the early stages. He looked pretty town. I already said my reads in one of my early posts from reading the whole game (comprehensively), so anyways I can give it again, but I'm so exhausted right now, and I feel pages 1-8 are more on my mind than 9-16 at this point.

I hate self votes.  <br>\n\n</div></blockquote>\n\nIf you don't like his vote on himself, why do you like your vote on him?</div></blockquote>\n\nOthers have pretty much said it for me, but the main thing here is that self voting tends to be an appeal to apathy or attempt at reverse psychology.  The whole line of reasoning being: I wouldn't do this if I was scum because scum values their life more, because townie self votes are a sign of frustration with the game in general, because it is counter intuitive to help kill yourself where you desire life.  It is a play off of Ocham's Razor and thus has been so commonly picked up on that where it was initially a town tell it is now a slight scum tell (in my eyes at least) because of how easily it can diffuse a situation.<br>\n<br>\nI wouldn't give it a 5:1 ratio, but from what I have seen it is probably a 2:1 and combined with his play it works to what I already suspect.  <br>\n<br>\nBeyond that, the amusing way that he tried to twist it by saying that I am absolving myself with it was pitifully scummy because it shows disparity between his self vote and his interest in self preservation, thus revealing that he does not want to die at all.  &lt;--- This + Play + Attitude = Scum.<br>\n<br>\nFurther, town PR's never self vote.  Never.  Thus I guarantee that if we push him to L-2 or so we would get a big fake claim that is utter bull.<br>\n<br>\nBag em.</div></blockquote>\nokay, cool. I'm scum for the self vote, I can see that. So will you offer to lynch yourself if I flip town? Meaning that if I do flip town will self vote and ride your own wagon. The reason I want to make this deal with you is ebcause I think you are exactly the type of wagon goer that could easily be scum. You hop on... wait a bit... and then justify your reasons with <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">generic</div> arguments that are not really applicable in this situation. Your hop seems opportunistic.

I'm scum for the self vote, I can see that. So will you offer to lynch yourself if I flip town? Meaning that if I do flip town will self vote and ride your own wagon. The reason I want to make this deal with you is ebcause I think you are exactly the type of wagon goer that could easily be scum. You hop on... wait a bit... and then justify your reasons with <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">generic</div> arguments that are not really applicable in this situation. Your hop seems opportunistic. Because I know I'm town, I have 100% full confidence in the proposition I am making.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Weak shit bargaining here, this is definitely what I expect of scum play.  So, yes.  I will happily vote myself if you flip town.  Question is, since you don't actually think I am scum as evidenced by your response to Grimgrooves post above, why do you want to kill another townie if you flip as one as well?  </div><br>\n<br>\nRed Dragon seems to have gone off the radar when the heat turned up.</div></blockquote>\nWhat the fuck are you talking about?

In the first, Slandaar attacked Gooner because of his vote on Elyse, and Elyse latched onto a strong player and sheeped him. In the second, Future got a sizeable wagon on him, Elyse called Baezu (who was trying to lynch future) scummy because of his attack, then suddenly Future joins Elyse's suspect list for no reason. <br>\n<br>\nNext, Elyse has apparently had a townread on Nachopappa, which contradicts her gooner scumread, and apparently has had a scumread on me for a while. The scumread on me came up after she was questioned about me, and the townread on Nachopappa came up after I asked her why she dropped her Gooner scumread. I don't like the timing of either of them.<br>\n<br>\nThen there's her posturing to jump on wagons with potshots, hypocrisy, lynching a lesser scumread with a bigger wagon because she feels one player she doesn't suspect is avoiding the wagon...

And he's right, I hate playing scum - especially around him - I'd be super paranoid and I'd lurk like crazy. One of our completed games is an example. If I'm playing without him and I'm scum, I might give an effort for a while until all my deceiving energies are gone, but eventually, rather quickly, the effort would just fizzle out because I hate it just that much. Normally, it is just not in my heart to make an effort to be so deceitful for an extended period of time. Moreso if people I'm familiar with are around.<br>\n<br>\nAnd before you do it, AtE is not a scumtell. If you're going to call circle-jerking \"fluff,\" don't. If you wish to make a case on me rather than going in a roundabout way about why everything in my post didn't make sense and was mega-fluff, I urge you to do that.</div></blockquote>\n\nThat's a very defensive last paragraph <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\"><br>\n<br>\nBut let us first look at the rest of this post:<br>\n<br>\nYou start by admitting you usually don't make much sense. Either this was meant in a comical fashion (fluff), or it meant an acknowledgment of my view that you don't. This is contradictory to the defensiveness in the last paragraph, where you seem very bothered by this view of mine.<br>\n<br>\nThe paragraph starting with \"honestly\" is a bunch of cowdung. Without mentioning the WIFOM-aspect of it all, meta'ing yourself is just as bad as agreeing with someone else's meta-study on you, even when this person seems to be all you desire to be. The point of my post was that I wanted to find out (note how I didn't reach any conclusions yet, making uyour defensiveness even stranger) in how far you actually did put in an effort, or if you were just randomly collecting posts and put some symbols next to them.<br>\n<br>\nFirst of all this procedure is not very helpful for any of us. When you are being asked about the \"why's\" of the exclamation marks and dollar signs, we are presented with a disclaimer that these are just preliminary observations, where you seem to want to apologize for possibly threading on any toes. Also the link between these dollarsigns and exclamation marks and the conclusions you reach on people is very unclear. <br>\n<br>\nI don't need to show why \"everything\" in your post doesn't make sense. But the sample study I did do (your read on me, because it was the easiest to carry out) doesn't make sense. If this is illustrative for the rest of your reads, I fear we might indeed have a deceitful heartless scum on our hands.<br>\n<br>\nI'll get back to your read on me in more detail later, I forgot to multiquote it and don't feel like starting this post all over again.<br>\n<br>\nAnd yes, of course I call your circlejerking (it's not really a circle though) fluff, what else could you call it? A helpful addition to catching scum?  Of course I don't mind the occasional tongue-in-cheeck comments and all that, this game is supposed to be fun, but this thing you're doing with Nachomamma is obviously some kind of act. A big act. Given the choice of your nickname I'm sure that this act goes beyond this game, but that doesn't mean you wouldn't be able to use it as some kind of cover as well. This whole thing makes the link between the two of you close to impossible to read and I don't like it.<br>\n<br>\nNow I want to move to your read on Nachomamma. Obviously there is something going on between the two of your that surpasses the realm of this game, but your interactions with him, I find them unnatural. <br>\n<br>\nAgain I failed to multiquote the segments where you voted him and you told him why. I'll feel free to paraphrase this thusly:<br>\n<br>\nNachpappa voted Nachomamma because he wasn't putting much effort in his posts, and didn't seem tob e scumhunting.<br>\nThis remark was coupled with buddying, along the lines of \"I don't want to vote you\", blahblehblah.<br>\n<br>\nThen Nachomamma makes a case (aka starts a war of the quotes) with Elyse, and Nachopappa is pleased, and not only does he remove his vote, he immediately sheeps him:<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5062703#p5062703\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5062703#p5062703\" data-post-id=\"5062703\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 469</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=21813\">Nachopappa</a> wrote:</cite>Yay, Nacho's actually making posts that make Pappa happy.<br>\n<br>\nPlease listen to Nacho, Elyse, or the ground beneath you will tremble. <br>\n<br>\nLove,<br>\n<br>\nMamma's friend Pappa<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">unvote</div></div></blockquote>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5062728#p5062728\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5062728#p5062728\" data-post-id=\"5062728\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 470</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=21813\">Nachopappa</a> wrote:</cite>Nacho, if you feel strongly that someone is scum, I'm just gonna sheep you.

Mind you, he could be right, but what I see is no scumhunting from Nachomamma's part, it's a tunnel. This tunnel might lead us to scum, but this tunnel might also be his easy way out of a thight spot. Making a case against one person is easy. You ISO them, you nitpcik on their posts, put everything in a bad light, and put the attention on them. That's why I asked about Nachomamma's reads on others. I want to find out if he really did try to find scum, or if he decided to focus on Elyse from the start in case he'd get in trouble himself.<br>\n<br>\nElyse does seem scummy enough, I'll check her meta to see if she's one of these people who always seem scummy. Some people do that, and Nachomamma might just be the kind of person to try and take advantage of that from the very start.

In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5039015#p5039015\">161</a> no other arguments are given besides this game theory disagreement, aside from a particularly agressive take on BP's post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5035054#p5035054\">112</a>, which he chooses to read in the worst possible light.<br>\n<br>\nThe following that happens is that Darthe gives him a townread for this awful post, and me putting question marks around this by stating what I just stated here.<br>\n<br>\nHe responds to this in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5040316#p5040316\">170</a> by a complete misrep of me and by asking me hordes of questions that have already been answered. This proved for me he hadn't really read the topic, or caught up as he promised on the 14th of June and pretended to deliver on the 17th of June.<br>\n<br>\nThis is where I'll actually start (partially) quoting, because the posts get a bit smaller. <br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5042087#p5042087\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5042087#p5042087\" data-post-id=\"5042087\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 191</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10742\">Ztife</a> wrote:</cite>@Grim<br>\nOk, I see.

This hints at a bias from the very start of the game, because why would he decide to take a closer look at BP's posts and not at others? He had 3-4 days of catching up, yet all he managed to do was read BP's posts?<br>\nNote that now suddenly, as opposed to <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5039015#p5039015\">161</a>, the game theory disagreement in itself is suddenly no longer the problem, and the sidenote and agressive interpretation of <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5035054#p5035054\">112</a> suddenly become the center of his \"case\". I responded to his question, but he never bothered to respond that that answer, probably because it didn't fit his story.<br>\nNote the promise he'll be catching up on the Future-wagon. All these promises of catching up sound to me like someone who doesn't put much effort into scumhunting and buys himself some time.<br>\n<br>\nIn post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5043808#p5043808\">201</a> we still see nothing of this supposed catching up with the Future-wagon, but just see another remark towards BP. BP is obviously still his only interest, and all this still based on this game theory discussion. If the case were strong I'd agree, but this kind of tunneled commitment is entirely unwarranted. <br>\n<br>\nThen finally, the catch-up with other things going on in this topic in post 220, which I'll split up a bit for the sake of being clearer.<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5044917#p5044917\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5044917#p5044917\" data-post-id=\"5044917\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 220</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10742\">Ztife</a> wrote:</cite>Don't really have any reads on future tbh since it looks like mostly semi-serious posting in RVS.

He starts the sentence with \"Can't get any reads\" and ends in the same way, and in between there's something that's supposed to speak in Future's favor (I don't actually understand the part about semi-serious posting), and one against Future for an overreaction. While I don't understand the first point, i don't believe it makes much sense. The second point definitely makes no sense. Future barely responded to my case.

Why would you not be able to properly bring your reasoning across in a short paragraph about my scumminess? <br>\n<br>\nAs I see it, the case is basically \"Ztife's weak case on BP and does nothing else, Ztife doesn't pay attention to the game enough, Ztife asks 'questions with no substances', Ztife's vote on nacho is fishy\"<br>\n<br>\nMy case on BP was not about the game theory, but about why he started the whole NL thing to begin with. The case is not about our views on NL, its about BP's wavering views on it.<br>\n<br>\nWhat's tunneling? How do you define tunneling? What defines me tunneling on BP? How does that makes me scum? Does mentioning BP in more than X amount of posts constitutes tunneling? I gave comments about low activity from the major wagons, and I don't think they put much thought into their posts, and they are not incredibly scummy to me.<br>\n<br>\nThis is in contrast with BP's \"LETS NL, OH NO WAIT, I AGREE WITH YOU, I THINK I\"LL LYNCH\". There's plenty of analysis about this, but I'll just skip it for now because his slot issin't even posting anyway.<br>\n<br>\nAbout reading, how do you define active? How do you define reading the game sufficiently? Do I have to make notes?<br>\nI skimmed through some parts, and I just happen to miss out yours, and therefore I asked double questions. Does that makes me scummy? For someone who is not really reading the game closely is he more likely scum or town? Please enlighten me what goes through in your mind.<br>\n<br>\nTo add, I think your views are weak/silly and that's why it was easier to miss them (I also mentioned that slandaar belongs to this group at the back of my mind). Your reason about sunny's \"misreading role pm\" and therefore not scum is just epic actually. The great scum hunter Grim posted a wall why Future is scum, and a dubious/ambiguous claim and suddenly he's town. Pretty rediculous if I must say. The only reason I didn't persue this is because I simply didn't find the slot to be scummy anyway.<br>\n<br>\nI like intereactions, I like posts, I like to question \"blank\" votes and views so that I may refer back to them later in the game. The connection between Peregrine's vote on nacho may not seem like a big deal now, but it could potentially be in the future. <br>\n<br>\nUnlike you, I don't believe in having the need to have \"substance behind every post\". I don't believe in earning town-cred. I scum hunt and part of the way I do it is to create discussion and reveal \"blanks\" so I can refer for inconsistancies and slips. I do see Nacho as a strong player because I believe he does this well.<br>\n<br>\nI believe Elyse seems to a passive player, but her posts does not give me the feeling that she intends to hide her reads or intentions. These are town-traits to me. Nacho's case seems abstract because I just can't see how her actions triggers his explainations. She didn't hide that she wants future and bp lynched/scum read. Having unoriginal reads D1 is not strange to me IMHO. Some players enter the game with strong reads just off a few posts. Other's takes more posts and a couple of cases and those that has similiar train of thoughts will have similiar reads. Null/passiveness is not a strong scum-read for me D1. In fact I actually think the flip and wagon formation is the most crucial D1 element. Towards the later days we will see which are the debates that were scum-town or town-town and it will be useful to reflect on the bandwagon formations.<br>\n<br>\nTherefore I can't think why Nacho would be this confident about elyse. Also, scums don't usually start wagons, and I think Nacho might be trying to fuck with our minds here, and therefore my gut says to get some pressure on this wagon.", "time": "Fri Jun 28, 2013 9:18 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=29135&start=500", "forum": "53", "thread": "29135"}

It is a circumstantial way to hunt for mafia and the reason for this is that the inverse cannot be said.

During the night, the mafia have to act together. They choose as a team which player's interactions get analyzed. If someone is fingering the entire mafia team, they may leave them alive over the player that has fingered all civs to try and get mislynches. They may do the opposite for supreme WIFOM. During the day, mafia can deliberately not interact or choose to interact in certain ways to deceive. If a mafia gets pegged, then they can dig to keep suspicion away from any teammates. A night kill has no deception; that player is killed. No matter what, that player is getting analyzed the next day, and the lynch that follows generally reveals why mafia made that night hit.<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: Elyse</span><br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Grimgroove</span><br>\n<br>\nMy vote for Elyse was because I didn't realize the RVS had ended.</div></blockquote>\nSo this whole post is about Theory its such an inconsequential thing from Grim but Gooner votes him over it because he disagrees.<br>\n<br>\nNow, at this point in the game BP No Lynch stuff had just begun, he completely ignored that, COMPLETELY.

I fully understand that mafia WIFOMs plenty, but at the end of the day (or in this case, night), someone is killed, and the town gets to analyze.

Post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5036786#p5036786\">129</a> may seem like a joke, but I actually somehow like it. It feels uneasy when you don't know how many enemies you are facing and to what extend you should trust others around you. I don't however see how Future's post screamed town or how Ztife's case was \"town read\". It was a long wall of information instead of analysis, everyone can tell why NL on D1 is bad. BP was obviously playing too much EpicMafia. Next, Darthe says NL on D1 is good? Didn't he just award Ztife a town read for saying the opposite? I think he either didn't read Ztife's post or didn't understand it; or probably goes with the flow, all of those speak bad. If he doesn't like people on Future's train, why is it that he doesn't like people jumping off either? Next, he predicts scum team right after accusing Baezu of doing the same, Elyse style. Nice reaction test, though, if it indeed was intended as such. I agree about SunnyDays, he's most likely a VI, sorry no offence. Some fluff posts, ignoring them. What does <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5058374#p5058374\">381</a> even mean? He criticises the poorly made analysis but bases conclusions off it? <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5059672#p5059672\">414</a>: of course RD didn't want to die, that's just stupid. Again, Elyse style he takes his actions as literally as possible, because that's most convenient (he thinks he can't get blame for misinterpretation, because after all RD said \"lynch me\" in straight text).<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Weak shit bargaining here, this is definitely what I expect of scum play.

Thank you for believing that I'm town. I am extremely new at this forum and grim had it right when he analyzed my reads to nacho in post 623. I honestly think Nachomamma is town. I agree with him being on my wagon - I've played like shit. Elyse I'm feeling more and more null towards. She and Nacho may actually both be town. Darthe I think is scum especially how Darthe flopped from me being town to an immediate vote once momentum was high. Since I've said before that I think Darthe is scum and his wagon is now picking up, I'm willing to jump on. I also really like Grim's case on Ztife. It actually seems almost as strong as the case on Darthe. That would be my pick for tomorrow's lynch.

Suddenly Baezu looks like a sizeable wagon and you instantly forget about Red Dragon and hop there immediately, based on completely nonexistent scum read. I'm sorry, but that's as scummy as it gets. Refer to Antagon in Newbie 1391 and Honest Abel in Newbie 1344.<br>\n\n</div></blockquote>\nThere is one thing that could potentially absolve Darthe, and that's his fakehammer. That was a very townie-thing to do and a real good find. People are usually honest post-hammer, and probably Darthe was trying to find out something in this way, by messing with SunnyDays' head.<br>\n<br>\nSo he's done one very townish thing and one very scumiish thing. This should make him null I guess, but it's easier to fake townish things (and there's also no point in faking scummish things), so the quotes above summary pretty well why he should be lynched.<br>\n<br>\nIf anything was derp Darthe, it was your switch to Baezu for no decent reason at all. Regardless of your alignment.</div></blockquote>\n\n<br>\nI believe that I have stated several times now that I am very suspect of RD and BP.  I am slightly suspect of Beazu.  <br>\nI have town reads on: Elyse, Nachomomma, Grim, Cherynobyl, Pere, Sal, and Sunny.  Beazu used to be on this list.<br>\nStranger and Nachopop I am null on.  Null really isn't accurate, because I have feelings about them, they are simply mixed.  Stranger is likely bias on my part, because he does things that I don't agree with and is seeing the game so differently that it seems off but he presents it genuinely.  Nacho is just all over the place.  <br>\n<br>\nThus, since I doubt my list is fully accurate, I must assume that my town reads at least include a scum between them in one or perhaps even two slots.  <br>\n<br>\nDiscussing why I switched on Beazu: It was simply a case of illogical confirmations on my side.  Of course, these things aren't apparent unless I type them up in full, but simply stated Beazu struck me as town because I thought that his play was just inconsistent enough to fit the role of a general townie attempting to move through a game without giving it their all.  The sort of play you see from people who are tired of being vanilla, who are playing in 3+ games at once, etc.  Further, I was busy pushing RDscum at the time.   However, literally attacking someone for something as you yourself do it is not the kind of illogical belief that I ever allow to go on without repercussion in a game.  I had some doubts clearly about the player before, but not his alignment if that makes sense?  Thus, when I saw his post my view had to change and with it and the realization that an RD lynch isn't happening, I switched and am further okay with my vote.  <br>\n<br>\nThis is simple logic, it doesn't seem necessary to explain it IMO, but the frankly moronic play that I have seen thus far seems to indicate that I may need to spell everything out.  If that offends you, it should.  The entire game has floundered (aka apathetically evolved into a state of waste not beneficial to actual reasoning) because nobody is willing to strike out and achieve a lynch.  Well, I am.  I honestly couldn't give a damn if it is Beazu because he isn't a big town read for me, and thus this is the best means to an end that I have, viewed by me as my best available risk.  Knowing my own alignment, I intend to naturally fight my own demise in this manner because I know that it can only cost the town.  See the logic?<br>\n<br>\nPast this I have no idea what you want me to respond to.  The problem with your play Grim is that you attempt to elicit response from people and seem to find conviction in your beliefs if they do not immediately do so, but you fail to ask any questions.  Everything above is my spelling out of my considerations, thoughts, and goals based on the assumption that these are the responses that you are looking for because you asked for a response to the quoted above and quite frankly their is nothing to respond to unless you were looking for me to explain in such detail why you are derptown?  <br>\n<br>\nThe above was sarcasm, but also an example of a question.  That is how this works.  Since I had no clue that you wanted or needed response here it was unnecessary for me to give such until you asked.  <br>\n<br>\nI think that should about clear things up!", "time": "Thu Jul 04, 2013 11:08 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=29135&start=675", "forum": "53", "thread": "29135"}

Baezu didn't vote someone for doing the same thing as he did, he voted someone who blamed him for doing something she did herself. In fact,h e's doing toh er what you later claim to do to him. Except that you're lying. You really should be lynched.<br>\n<br>\nThis is exactly why I wanted you to explain in detail why you voted on Baezu: to make it as clear as possible to anyone your reasons are very, very flawed. Like I said before: the switch from \"Baezu is not an option\" to \"Lynch Baezu\" after one post by her is not backed up in a satisfactory way, despite the switch being close to 180 degrees (even though you now claim you had doubts about her before, you did say she was not an option. You can't weasle your way out of that, yet you try).<br>\n<br>\nAbout my play being derp: it quite possibly is. But I have no way to know if your comments are honest or if you're just scum trying to make me doubt my reads. I propose we move this subject to the post-game discussions, where I will be open to any crticisms on my play. It's obvious I'm still learning.</div></blockquote>\n\nFirst, I treat people as their own player.   If I replace into games then I treat myself as different to my replacement to measure myself in comparison to them.  Likewise, I do this with other replacements when I see differences.  Thus, BP was on my radar and I talked about him but I haven't much about stranger yet because I don't consider him in the same light.  I have done this in past games as town and mafia.  <br>\n<br>\nSecond: Beazu's vote and my stance on Beazu's vote are different entities entirely tied to the scenario.  You can choose to read it that way if you wish to, however I did not see Beazu's statement as anything other than hypocritical and opportunistic.  To me, this is enough to roll the dice on for D1.<br>\n<br>\nYour play is not bad, I quite enjoy it and the analysis is good honestly.  I simply have insight to my alignment and perhaps that is coloring my judgement.

I already pointed out in my previous, independent, post-by-post analysis on Elyse: she contradicts herself all the time and then accuses people of being scum for things she herself does. First post: \"I want to kill someone without influence\". Rest of the game: \"I agree with that\", \"Yes, that's sort of true\", \"Mhm, lynch him\". I don't want to repeat myself. Read my own post about Elyse. The essence is: accusing someone of things you yourself do renders your case void and drops you down the scumslope. Do I need to explain that? Fine, I will. <br>\n<br>\nAssume Johnny does X. According to Alfred, X is very scummy. Alfred has been doing X all game. By Alfred's own logic, he himself is mafia. The self-declared mafia accuses Johnny of being scum. Johnny points out how Alfred is wrong. You say pointing out how Alfred is wrong is scummy. <br>\n<br>\nSo to sum up, you:<br>\n1) switch sheepportunistically on Baezu, ignoring your mega-suspect (his wagon had lost momentum by that time)<br>\n2) ignore all town reads on Baezu<br>\n3) say Baezu is scummy using a self-contradictory logic<br>\n4) say I'm committing a logical fallacy for ignoring town reads on you<br>\n<br>\nExplain to me how is your case valid and why you shouldn't be lynched already. \"Talking out of your ass\" is not an acceptable defence.

From the get go we have useless rhetoric (self directed, which helps nobody as its a trap), comment on Elyse who I haven't spoken about besides to mention him/her in my town reads, a completely and utterly illogical hypothetical situation (try and figure out Johnny and Alfred, the only way it works is if one of them knows that they are mafia already and town doesn't so is this a scumslip or am I misreading?), a summation that doesn't work because it ignores my actual points in favor of the players perspective, and then sums it with more self directed rhetoric.<br>\n<br>\n^Everyone should take the time to read my analysis of this post.

At that point Baezu was oddly clingy for survival, which I explained to myself as either scum or a town power role, leaning towards the latter, which is why I believed her to be town despite the oddities. Of course, I kept my mouth shut, but once she claimed I was quickly to believe it because of my former read on her. Apparently Darthe just thought otherwise, but pulled up the wrong reason, which was glaringly scummy for me.<br>\n<br>\nHe made a point that he saw BP as scummy and me as null, because I saw the game very differently. This is a good time to remind others that I'm a late replacement and was fed enormous amounts of posts (lots of them pretty big, hi Grimgroove <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":roll:\" title=\"Rolling Eyes\">) over very short time. My reads were almost exclusively ISO based rather than interaction-based, which may have caused noticeable distortion in my game view and alarmed Darthe. Sadly I can't read Day 1 the exact same way as the others, and I'm sure players who've replaced late in the game can relate.<br>\n<br>\nHis dying Fingers oS were on Red Dragon, on Baezu and on me for condemning his logic (#<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5087423#p5087423\">723</a>) on the Baezu FoS. I will not back out my condemnation because his logic was extremely poor, not to mention Baezu is clearly town (I will later explain why she is town).<br>\n<br>\nHis case on RD was along the lines of \"he's laying low\", \"he's self-voting\", \"he is upset because Sunny Days lynch died\". Whether or not we should look deep into it remains questionable, seeing how his reads were mostly wrong.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Slandaar (<div style=\"display:inline;color:darkblue\">+2</div>)</div><br>\nI think Slandaar's play so far has been a classic analytical scumhunter, observing all angles and weighing his decision carefully, but once he's convinced of something, he will most likely defend it to the point when mod reveals the truth. I fear his rigidity might sway his decision in the wrong direction, but I like his confidence and passion. I can't help but imagine a marching general towards the enemy fortress who'd stop at nothing to destroy it. Strong town read from him at this point.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Grimgroove (<div style=\"display:inline;color:darkblue\">+2</div>)</div><br>\nGrimgroove's play is very similar to mine, except he drops ALL his thoughts down which makes him seem a little hesitating and consequently less charismatic. Notice how he and I said basically the same thing about Darthe in the end of the day, only his post was quite roundabout and more of a light conversation and mine was a direct, aggressive accusation. I do think he'd do good to be more confident, as a calm conversation wouldn't stress the scum and make them panic, but would rather allow them stay calm and build up a defence. However his scumhunting is excellent and I like how I think of something, then look at his post and see he thought the exact same thing. Obvious townie is obvious.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Ztife (<div style=\"display:inline;color:red\">-1</div>)</div><br>\nHer involvement is flaking and her scum case against my predecessor was all in all a wall of IIoA about how NL on D1 is bad. Funny thing that Darthe had a town read on her precisely because of that post, which seemed to me, Baezu and Grimgroove scummy. I'd wait to see a little more from her, but so far I'm dissatisfied.

Why would you not be able to properly bring your reasoning across in a short paragraph about my scumminess? <br>\n<br>\nAs I see it, the case is basically \"Ztife's weak case on BP and does nothing else, Ztife doesn't pay attention to the game enough, Ztife asks 'questions with no substances', Ztife's vote on nacho is fishy\"<br>\n<br>\nMy case on BP was not about the game theory, but about why he started the whole NL thing to begin with. The case is not about our views on NL, its about BP's wavering views on it.<br>\n<br>\nWhat's tunneling? How do you define tunneling? What defines me tunneling on BP? How does that makes me scum? Does mentioning BP in more than X amount of posts constitutes tunneling? I gave comments about low activity from the major wagons, and I don't think they put much thought into their posts, and they are not incredibly scummy to me.<br>\n<br>\nThis is in contrast with BP's \"LETS NL, OH NO WAIT, I AGREE WITH YOU, I THINK I\"LL LYNCH\". There's plenty of analysis about this, but I'll just skip it for now because his slot issin't even posting anyway.<br>\n<br>\nAbout reading, how do you define active? How do you define reading the game sufficiently? Do I have to make notes?<br>\nI skimmed through some parts, and I just happen to miss out yours, and therefore I asked double questions. Does that makes me scummy? For someone who is not really reading the game closely is he more likely scum or town? Please enlighten me what goes through in your mind.<br>\n<br>\nTo add, I think your views are weak/silly and that's why it was easier to miss them (I also mentioned that slandaar belongs to this group at the back of my mind). Your reason about sunny's \"misreading role pm\" and therefore not scum is just epic actually. The great scum hunter Grim posted a wall why Future is scum, and a dubious/ambiguous claim and suddenly he's town. Pretty rediculous if I must say. The only reason I didn't persue this is because I simply didn't find the slot to be scummy anyway.<br>\n<br>\nI like intereactions, I like posts, I like to question \"blank\" votes and views so that I may refer back to them later in the game. The connection between Peregrine's vote on nacho may not seem like a big deal now, but it could potentially be in the future. <br>\n<br>\nUnlike you, I don't believe in having the need to have \"substance behind every post\". I don't believe in earning town-cred. I scum hunt and part of the way I do it is to create discussion and reveal \"blanks\" so I can refer for inconsistancies and slips. I do see Nacho as a strong player because I believe he does this well.<br>\n<br>\nI believe Elyse seems to a passive player, but her posts does not give me the feeling that she intends to hide her reads or intentions. These are town-traits to me. Nacho's case seems abstract because I just can't see how her actions triggers his explainations. She didn't hide that she wants future and bp lynched/scum read. Having unoriginal reads D1 is not strange to me IMHO. Some players enter the game with strong reads just off a few posts. Other's takes more posts and a couple of cases and those that has similiar train of thoughts will have similiar reads. Null/passiveness is not a strong scum-read for me D1. In fact I actually think the flip and wagon formation is the most crucial D1 element. Towards the later days we will see which are the debates that were scum-town or town-town and it will be useful to reflect on the bandwagon formations.<br>\n<br>\nTherefore I can't think why Nacho would be this confident about elyse. Also, scums don't usually start wagons, and I think Nacho might be trying to fuck with our minds here, and therefore my gut says to get some pressure on this wagon.</div></blockquote>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5062515#p5062515\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5062515#p5062515\" data-post-id=\"5062515\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 461</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10742\">Ztife</a> wrote:</cite>5 days to deadline.<br>\nIn the exchange between Elyse and Nacho, nacho's case seems abstract, Elyse gives me an overrall more town feel.</div></blockquote>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#BF00BF\">Mod Edit: Removed quoted unauthorized use of Mod's color and fixed quote tags.</div>", "time": "Thu Jul 11, 2013 6:51 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=29135&start=850", "forum": "53", "thread": "29135"}

No. But what it shows is a good townlist<br>\n<br>\nGrim/Elyse/Sland/Baezu/NachoP<br>\n<br>\nContinuing on lets see who shows up in the slots past the first 3.<br>\n<br>\nBaezu x2<br>\nSland<br>\nPV x4<br>\nRD<br>\nNachoP<br>\nSunny<br>\nCher x2<br>\nGrim<br>\nZtife<br>\n<br>\nBaezu has been on lots early so being on them late isn't that much of an issue. PV needs lynching which was very aparent as soon as I saw his name on all 4. Cher looks a little worse but I don't know exactly how much weight to put into that.<br>\n<br>\nI have been assuming every wagon was on town. Sunny/NachoP/Elyse/Baezu all seem town and then Darthe/Nacho are confirmed. I don't think too much changes if I am wrong regarding this, there have been so many big wagons this means scum are happily jumping on wagons (see the variation in names? its different a lot of the time) the biggest culprit being PV<br>\n<br>\nTurns out this analysis was a case on PV.<br>\n<br>\nWorth noting; if anyone wants to suggest I have this wrong, its not good to assume scum are not starting many wagons then think about this; if scum are starting even 50% of the wagons then it means they are making well reasoned logical cases on Town and the town are sheeping them around. No I don't think this is what is happening either and if it is well town is pretty screwed.<br>\n<br>\nThis is a lot to read so a <div style=\"font-size: 250%; line-height: normal; display: inline\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Summary</div></div> for people who don't want to read what isn't too interesting or useful;<br>\n<br>\nFuture: Grim/Cher/BP/Baezu/Nacho/Sland/<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">PV</div><br>\nGooner: Elyse/Sland/Grim/Baezu/<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">PV</div><br>\nNacho: Grim/Baezu/NachoP/RD/<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">PV</div><br>\nDarthe: Stranger/Grim/Baezu/NachoP/Sunny/Cher/<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">PV</div><br>\n<br>\nCher looks a little more suspect also.<br>\n<br>\nHonestly mostly what this has done is reinforced certain ideas for example Elyse especially looks town for it.<br>\n<br>\nI would be happy lynching PV today insted of RD.", "time": "Fri Jul 12, 2013 8:11 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=29135&start=875", "forum": "53", "thread": "29135"}

There's a certain belief that this alignment will shine through the actions. They don't feel the need to say stuff that normally go without saying, like not wanting to lynch a cop. Scum wants to take easy opportunities to appear town by stating such Obvious things, and I think that's what you just did.<br>\nSorry to hear you seem to be doing badly.

What do I mean by this?<br>\n<br>\nConsider the first thing that Ztife chooses to comment on this game: BP's arguments for no-lynch.  In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5039015#p5039015\">#161</a>, Ztife attacks BP's arguments for no-lynching as incorrect and anti-town, which they are.<br>\n<br>\nIn the process of all this she completely ignores the ongoing Future wagon, which had picked up considerable strength at this point.

I think this unwillingness to commit to a position on which she might be challenged is considerably more likely to come from scum than town.<br>\n<br>\nElsewhere in her ISO, there is a lot of wishy-washiness, a lot of promises of analysis with no follow-through, and no followable thread of reasoning in her reads.  BP is still her \"highest scumread\" as of <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=461#p461\">#461</a>, but she shows no interest in engaging with him after the early-game argument and pays no attention at all to Miss Stranger when she replaces him (actually there are no mentions at all of Miss Stranger in Ztife's ISO).  She joins the Peregrine wagon with no reasoning, then leaves it after his claim for equally no reason.<br>\n<br>\nActually, her reactions to the claims in general are really quite horrendous.  When Sunny claims, she calls it \"incredibly ambiguous\" in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=371#p371\">#371</a> without taking a side.  When Elyse claims, her reaction is not to consider the plausibility of the claim but to ask in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=838#p838\">#838</a> why she claimed at L-2.  When PV claims, she is first noncommittal (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=971#p971\">#971</a>: \"I just can't get anything of what he says into my head\") and then, after Grimgroove calls the claim convincing, suddenly she feels the same way too (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=976#p976\">#976</a>).<br>\n<br>\nIt's hard for me to see how Ztife could be town.", "time": "Fri Jul 26, 2013 2:32 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=29135&start=1025", "forum": "53", "thread": "29135"}

At this point the only information the minority have over the majority is they know who is on their team. They don't know who or if there is a last PR and we are offering to give them that information so they can choose to kill the odd cop claim, or this potentially other PR. If they are good they can kill two birds in one night by claiming that anyone who says they are a PR is lying and getting us to lynch them. I know if I was a PR in this situation I would claim vanilla, not for the sake of saving my own butt, but because I am more useful hidden. In the scenario that we do get a PR claim, what is the plan then? If it's something passive like a bulletproof or something, we have gained nothing.

This is eccentric behaviour, perhaps, but not completely ridiculous; I feel like Slandaar is sensible and experienced enough to accept that this would be a plausible action for Peregrine to take in that position. It was Peregrine's doctor claim not lining up with Elyse's role that made him the right lynch, not his claimed target. This is significant because it could point to Slandaar deliberately overselling his point in order to secure a mislynch on Peregrine, whose doctor claim he would presumably have very little reason to disbelieve as scum.", "time": "Tue Jul 30, 2013 10:53 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=29135&start=1075", "forum": "53", "thread": "29135"}

My thoughts are that you guys are mean for leaving me all alone there. But on a serious note, you both appear null upon reading it. I think it's very unlikely that 3 neighbors are all town. I wish Grim would post in thread, because I really don't feel like going back to read 40 pages. I haven't figured out if either of you are more town than the other. Stranger seemed to think you were town, but the reasoning there was bad. Mafia have 100% accuracy when it comes to choosing town players, so I'm not impressed by your defense of Darthe. Nothing that either of you said really stood out to me, but I skimmed it so maybe I missed something. Because of the uncertainty, I would rather lynch someone outside of the hood first (assuming 3 mafia are in the game). If you can present a good case for Lucky I will put my vote there. <br>\n<br>\ntl;dr- The two of you are null. I want Grim to post. Defending Darthe does not make you town.

What I'm going to do is arrange the thoughts I have with all of you off the top of my head. I'll try and base a listing on that, but I would like to ask SunnyDays what he would like to achieve through these lists.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Lucky2u</div><br>\nThis one is my main scumread. For several reasons I've already pointed out earlier, and for reasons pointed out by others as well. I will re-iterate them at some point, but like I said, this is at the top of my head, so going into detail doesn't make much sense. His play just feels wrong in so many ways. Also, given my reads on others, I just can't see a two-man scumteam in this group that doesn't contain him. <br>\nThe main point of today though should not be to lynch lucky2u. Eventhough he should be the lynch of today eventually (the man is obvscum, even his last list doesn't make sense, why on earth would he lynch himself over me? Why does he even include himself in that list in the first place? He's trying to play mindtricks, and at this stage this shows his scum mindset imo. Lynching him will not lose us the game, of that I am convinced), BUT we first must try to find his remaining scumbuddy before ending this stage, so that the next day's LyLo can be tackled with a bit more confidence for whoever remains. <br>\nLooking at Ztife's and Lucky's past interactions might give us something. I don't think we'll get anything out of Lucky now. I'm sure he's been properly coached by his scumbud during the last nightphase.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">SunnyDays</div><br>\nAs StupendousMan will be able to confirm, during the night, in our neighborhood, I expressed sudden doubt about SunnyDays. I felt as if he slipped away from my attention too easily. Because Future (his predecessor) was my main scumread for a long time, and not without reason. The townslip felt like an easy way for him to shake off any bad attention.<br>\nBUT I looked again at the time where this happened. Not only does his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5050002#p5050002\">287</a> feel like a genuine townslip every time I read, so do the first posts after that. In fact it's a big townslip-fest. Not only did he claim in such a way that it cannot be a lie (or it would be an extremely clever one), he also thought he was hammered (which I believe he really did, again, if he didn't, it would be extremely clever). And look at his reaction after he was supposedly hammered. He was still upholding his innocence and his disappointment felt very sincere. Now, I guess some people are just jerks during twilight and still lie then, but two events to look very very much like townslips are just impossible to ignore. And in all honesty, most of his other play also looks pretty town. Shame about the comparatively low activity.<br>\nI'm writing down SunnyDays as conftown. Looking at his preference list I am a bit dissappointed, as I was hoping I'd be able to work in tandem with him, but it doesn't look like this will be the case.<br>\nSunnyDays, you should explain your reads and give me something to work with.<br>\n<br>\nAnd now for the dilemma: Shamrock and StupendousMan.

There's a big sense of drama inthere that obfuscates things, and while the obfuscation may be unintentional and organically created through the having of a good time, it can also be intentional.

Also, please answer and think about this question for me: Do you really think as scum I would've said that the people who aren't on Ztife's scum lists are partners? Because that would imply by my own reasoning that I'm scum, and don't you think I would've noticed that if I were actually scum due to being more cautious?<br>\n<br>\nOh, and also Grim, as for what you said about SunnyDays, I was trying to figure out if there was a possibility of him being scum at all, unlike everyone else who is immediately dismissing him as conftown. I have since also decided that he is probably conftown, but don't you think that it would be more likely for scum to call him conftown and try to buddy, than for town to do so? Because it's more likely for town to question it, which is what I did. Your ambiguous statements about my interaction with Lucky and things I said in the neighborhood QT have no real basis, and if you are going to say such things you should at least back yourself up with examples.<br>\n<br>\n@Shamrock- What are your thoughts on SunnyDays' list? What are your thoughts on Lucky's list?<br>\n<br>\n@SunnyDays- Why was I last on your list? Even I would say that Grim has been much more town than I have in this game.

If he is buddying, why would you get so defensive about me thinking about the possibility of you being partners?</div></blockquote>\n\nIt's a conclusion, yes, but based on WIFOM. Maybe you don't understand the term, or you don't see how it applies here, so I'll try to spell out for you how it is WIFOM in this case. You see, you are wondering why Lucky has done a certain action, but all you have is the action itself to base your conclusion on. <br>\n<br>\nLucky could have put my name after his because of reasons that he said himself: to be funny. Or for the other reason he says: he's convinced I'm town and think it's better to keep me in than himself, due to an appreciation for my play.<br>\nIt could also be more devious. He might have put the list that way because he wants to buddy up to me. Or maybe he did it because he wants people to wonder if there's a connection between us. Or he might hope that by doing something so bold and in the open, people might believe there is NO such connection, while there actually is.<br>\n<br>\nThat's what I mean by him playing mindtricks. I don't believe for a second he's simply trying to be funny. He's trying to confuse things, and where there was a simple demand by SunnyDays, he tried to complicate things. <br>\n<br>\nAs I know my own alignment, it is a bit easier to strike out certain possibilities from above. But I don't like how the first conclusion you came up with was me being Lucky's buddy, with all these other explanations abound. You have a lingering intention to find scummy stuff about me, and as you don't seem to find them in my posts, you try this apporach, probably in accordance and symphony with your scumbuddy, Lucky.<br>\n<br>\nAt least, that's my line of thinking.<br>\n<br>\nSimilar for the following:<br>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><blockquote><div><cite>Grimgroove wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5250474#p5250474\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5250474#p5250474\" data-post-id=\"5250474\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 1329</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=21990\">StupendousMan</a> wrote:</cite>\n<br>\n@Grim- What do you think of the quote below?<br>\n<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5166611#p5166611\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5166611#p5166611\" data-post-id=\"5166611\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 1053</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10742\">Ztife</a> wrote:</cite>Sunny/grim strikes me as a probable scum team, which is the only reason why I think both could be scum ATM.

I suppose it could be distancing between the two of you, but I'm more inclined to believe you're town.</div></blockquote>\n\nThat's mostly WIFOM. It could mean anything. I think a more sensible and common scum-tactic is to mix it up a bit, have one scumpartner as a townread, and the other as a scumread, or throw in a null somewhere. But there's no way of being sure what Ztife's line of thinking was here.

You say you wouldn't do that as scum, but that line of thinking could have exactly been the reason why you DID do it as scum. It brings us to circular reasoning that is unhelpful. In fact, if you look up at my quote, you see I asked you the same exact question. Instead of throwing it back in my face, it would have been good form to just answer it yourself. Why do you feel an argmuent that is valid against yourself, is usuable against Shamrock, knowing your own alignment? Yousupposedly know your town, and thus know the argument doesn't hold against you. This makes the argument in valid. Yet you choose to use it against Shamrock.<br>\n<br>\nAnd besides that, yes, the whole thing is WIFOM. Ztife will have thought before putting down these reads. He could have been thinking of possible associations, reverse psychology and whatnot. There's no way of telling for sure. Other paths must be explored if you really want to crack this. <br>\n<br>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Oh, and also Grim, as for what you said about SunnyDays, I was trying to figure out if there was a possibility of him being scum at all, unlike everyone else who is immediately dismissing him as conftown.

That first sentence makes it sound as if you were the first to question SunnyDays' conftown-status (\"everyone else immediately dismissing...\"). It was not. It was me who did that. It was me who questioned SunnyDays, a doubt I have expressed when showing my read on him, but a doubt that had no basis according to MY findings. You're trying to put feathers on your hat for stuff I did. And in the QT you still had doubts about SunnyDays even after I invoked the doubletriple townslip he made. Please tell me then, what it was that made YOU confident of SunnyDays town-alignment?<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nYour interactions with Lucky today just feel forced, simple as that.

Should have went with my gut.  <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":giggle:\" title=\"Giggling\">", "time": "Thu Sep 05, 2013 3:34 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=29135&start=1425", "forum": "53", "thread": "29135"}

Well done, MattP. I kind of agree with you that it feels a little bit weird faking newbieness as scum but I think the same goes for town, tbh, and it's hard to know where the line should be drawn. I know your intentions weren't bad so it's fine and you played it excellently. V/LA matching up on alts is one of those things that I think you notice and worry about when you do it but that nobody else actually really sees, having experienced it myself. I would never have guessed, I don't think!<br>\n<br>\nI'm really sorry that I slipped out of activity here and got lynched - in a really busy summer, this just got a bit lost. Apologies.</div></blockquote>\nUgh, come on this is too nicey nice. He wasn't going to act like a newbie if he was town, this is blatantly obvious by the fact he outed the alt in the first place, he now had the perfect alt to take into a town game and act the newbie but he didn't take it.<br>\n<br>\nI am almost positive its against site rules to create an account and join as a newbie in newbie games if you have another account; I don't see any difference to what happened here except the obvious; its not a newbie game but the principle of why you don't do it should still apply.<br>\n<br>\nAt the very least its not playing in the spirit of the game and gaining huge advantages playing on an alt which is clearly just gamebreaking. What happens to the alt now? lost in time I assume, so he is going to create another one and do the same thing again when he rolls scum. Noone else is doing this they have their experience on display; game breaking.</div></blockquote>\nThat's actually not true.<br>\n<br>\nI intended to pretend to be a \"newb\" either way, so that people wouldn't have any inclination of who I was. I wanted there to be no alt guessing (you see alts in games all the time that are out about being an alt and players will badger them and alt guess the entire game; myself being a culprit)<br>\n<br>\nMy intention was to join a game as a newb, pretend for a bit I didn't know the site culture to make it believable, and then quickly play at the level of proficiency I wanted to play at (the intention was to be less hostile and narcissistic than usual). When I rolled scum I didn't like it, but I planned to follow that same plan but from the scum side. I was already run up and I couldn't just MAGICALLY do proficient town things if I wanted to be viewed as a beginner, so I was forced to do a stupid newbslip. I figured it was all right (but blurred lines) specifically because people ALWAYS as scum bullshit things like not knowing the NK, or other fabricated townslips. ASIDE from the fact I wanted to start as a newb, I faked a stupid townslip, and this was something that occurred to me as a tactic after the decision to come in as a newb.<br>\n<br>\nHere's the issue. People are allowed to join games and pretend to be from offsite when they're in a town slot. However, it was considered dishonest since it was a scum slot. I didn't pretend to be a newb in order to have an advantage as scum, I pretended to be a newb to have people see me with a fresh point of view and to leave me alone. <br>\n<br>\nI don't know, I DO feel icky for faking it, and I felt really on the fence AFTER the fact (I didn't think about it being potentially wrong until after it had happened, I was frankly in overdrive to push me out of danger and I did that). <br>\n<br>\nAnother issue was that it ruined my plan to pretend for maybe 10-20 pages I was crap and then become more efficient, because you lie as scum, and therefore I had to go from being a terrible lying player to a better lying player instead of lying for a fraction of the game and then being the new truthful personality I wanted to test out<br>\n<br>\nI don't know, that was my thought process and the conflicts I had when I thought it over, and the reason I was on the fence about it being right or wrong", "time": "Thu Sep 05, 2013 2:30 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=29135&start=1425", "forum": "53", "thread": "29135"}

I think that's stupid, because having a fresh start is nice sometimes. Additionally, another point for why it isn't necessarily wrong to fake being newbscum is because newbscum DO get coached into stupid townslips in games and players DO have to judge the slips to be truthful or not.
