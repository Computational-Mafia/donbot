Well, to be honest, I think the concept sounds ridiculously boring, and also the idea of having to read prior games in order to gain a competitive advantage (knowing player meta, etc) is distasteful to me, because it then feels like some aspects of the game become about who is willing to waste more time reading old game threads to get that advantage, and that's just not a game I want to play.

I have played in two games total in the newbie queue of this site, and that is the entire sum of my experience with the game of mafia in any form.<br>\n<br>\nYou may wonder why I wouldn't have read any prior games.  Well, to be honest, I think the concept sounds ridiculously boring, and also the idea of having to read prior games in order to gain a competitive advantage (knowing player meta, etc) is distasteful to me, because it then feels like some aspects of the game become about who is willing to waste more time reading old game threads to get that advantage, and that's just not a game I want to play.  Thus far I have patently refused to read prior game threads for the purposes of researching someone's meta, even when directly asked to by the IC whom I had a lynch vote on.<br>\n<br>\nHowever, I would make an exception to my personal rule about not reading old game threads if the purpose was to actually inform myself about the game setup.  Not having any clue of the game setup and having to ask questions about it is just going to waste people's time.  And I'm already somewhat sorry that I've done so here, because I'm sure it's irritating some people already.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nThis looks cautious to me. \"Before you call me out for this I'll address it\"<br>\n<br>\nand in this game there's a user called West.

I believe Aeronaut's first quote says that you stopped pushing on me starting with post 56.  His second quote says that post 49 is where you start conceding after being pressured to stop \"being so aggressive\", and after that, specifically say that you're not calling me scum, just voting for me for the purpose of applying pressure, which he claims is not true because you didn't do anything beyond the vote to try to pressure me after that, spending your time fighting with Lapsa instead.<br>\n<br>\nPutting aside the merits of those statements, I don't understand your question of \"Which is it, Aero?\"  Those statements don't seem to me to be in conflict so I don't think Aero needs to defend your implication that they can't both be true.<br>\n<br>\nAlso, why did you change your avatar mid-game?

Especially since all the pisskop votes were on page 2 and probably made with some kind of reckless abandon about the possibility of taking him to L-1 too early.

Why would someone who gets to L-1 so soon be more likely to be town than scum?  I personally am very happy with how that wagon went, and you should be too if you actually care about catching scum.  We applied some really good early pressure to pisskop, and some interesting stuff came out of it.  He wasn't lynched, and honestly I don't think there was ever any great risk that he would be, nobody is going to actually carry through on a lynch that early, unless we have really suicidal players in here.  And I don't think that watering down the scum hunting because you're afraid that some loose canon will screw things up is the best strategy.  Play your best, if someone is going to screw things up they'd do so whether you play your best or your worst, so just play your best.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>evilpacman18 wrote:</cite><br>\nNow I personally subscribe to the old scumhunting adage that the third and fourth spots on a wagon are more likely to be scum.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nI think that's really lazy.  You must realize that any scum who is aware of this \"old scumhunting adage\" will just game you on it so you can't trust that at all if you believe that it's as universally accepted as you apparently think it is.  It's not that I mind being one of the two under suspicion because of this \"adage\", it's just that I think that it highlights how your entire post basically just feels like a sequence of poorly connected attempts to reach a conclusion that you had already decided you wanted to reach.  More on that in a minute.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>evilpacman18 wrote:</cite><br>\nI'm down to lynch Nickname today<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nI cannot even describe how incongruous this is with the rest of the sentiment in your post.  You wrote a lengthy post trying to break down why the quick wagon on pisskop was due to \"vote happy\", reckless town play ... and then you proceed to state that you'd be happy lynching Nickname, on very little evidence, on day 3, when we still have so much time to go.  Do you think that actually placing a vote on little evidence is \"vote happy\", but calling for a day 3 lynch based on almost nothing, is not the same thing?  I mean yeah, you didn't place a vote, but promising to vote, and even going so far as to say that you'd like to see Nickname lynched, not just pressured, is just about the same thing.<br>\n<br>\nevilpacman18's post 208 is perhaps the scummiest post I have seen in this entire thread to date.  It reads to me like he was searching for a town target to try to start some suspicion towards, and so had to build up a \"case\" out of a bunch of loosely connected poorly supported arguments.<br>\n<br>\nIt starts with the false premise that \"anyone who gets to L-1 like 3 pages into a brand new game is really likely to be town\", then builds up with implications that town is \"vote happy\" and that this is somehow a bad/scummy thing, adding supporting \"evidence\" in the form of quoting all of the pisskop votes, proceeding to use the lazy \"old scumhunting adage\", and then finding something that evilpacman18 thought he could really dig into with Aeronaut's vote, which is the obvious easy target because Aeronaut actually provided the most evidence for his vote out of everyone.   However, evilpacman18 doesn't actually vote Aeronaut despite all of the verbage dedicated to describing how his vote was so suspicious.<br>\n<br>\nAfter all of that, the end conclusion is to vote for Nickname basically just because he put pisskop back at L-1 after Lapsa took his vote off of the pisskop wagon.<br>\n<br>\nIt's like all of the stuff prior to the Nickname vote was just verbage intended to make it look like there was a coherent argument there without actually having one.  It feels made up.<br>\n<br>\nRight now my scummiest reads are pisskop (because of his defensiveness), Lapsa (because of his lack of desire to catch scum and his well-timed efforts at trying to take attention away from pisskop when pisskop was on the hot seat), and evilpacman18, because of the entirety of post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6652520#p6652520\">208</a>, as well as the fact that it was enough to \"convince\" the likely-scum Lapsa to unvote him.<br>\n<br>\nIs it really possible that pisskop, Lapsa, and evilpacman18 are trying to coordinate so transparently?", "time": "Fri Mar 06, 2015 6:43 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=60961&start=225", "forum": "53", "thread": "60961"}

So before I get to that I want you tell me if it is simply convincing enough that nobody else so far seems to have a problem with the logical consistency of my post besides you. Most of my answers to your questions would have to do with the amount of experience that I have and you don't and my familiarity with site meta... IE the third and fourth person on a wagon being more likely to be scum is actually still pretty effective. It (wagon placement) is not something people pay attention to much as scum (rightly so because trying too hard tends to be an obvious tell) so they slip into scummy slots almost naturally sometimes. Anyway it's not a huge tell, notice how I didn't end up scumreading the people (you and Lapsa) in those two slots because of their vote placement. It was just something to lead off with. And D1 quicklynches are never on scum. That's not something you could know with only one game under your belt but it's just the truth. So when someone gets to L-1 by page three, my reaction is to hardcore town read them. And yes it is a stupid idea to put someone at L-1 by page 3. Again, not something you could be expected to know but it's just not helpful. This is more my own personal mafia philosophy but I don't think vote pressure actually serves to make people react in ways that makes their alignment more transparent so I am a conservative voter. I usually don't vote D1 until I would be comfortable with that person being lynched. Which means that even though I said I'd be down to lynch Nickname, I didn't mean right now. That's just a direction I would be fine with this day eventually going in.f", "time": "Fri Mar 06, 2015 8:26 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=60961&start=250", "forum": "53", "thread": "60961"}

He says post 49 is the start of my backing off of BJI.  He still has yet to comment or repond to this.<br>\n -He accuses me of omgusing first BJI and then himself.  At this point in time I had 3 votes, one of which was rvs on SW, and a second pressure vote on BJI.  I accuse him of exaggerating, a point which he has not responded to.<br>\n<br>\n4) In post (<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6650522#p6650522\" class=\"postlink\">145</a>) Aero asks for a specific example in his meta.<br>\n - He then contradicted his 95 by saying 56 is the start of my backing off of BJI.  This has been pointed out, but he has not responded to it.<br>\n - Aero accuses me of 'yelling' at Lapsa in my post <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6647385#p6647385\" class=\"postlink\">56</a>.<br>\n<br>\n5) in his <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6655769#p6655769\" class=\"postlink\">342</a> Aero implies I already looked into his meta.

He then uses this fabricated stance to try to further push me.<br>\n\"I don't know where you get that impression, Just because someone has stuff to do doesn't make them more town. \"<br>\n<br>\n - Aero continues to push fabricated material wrt 'yelling' at Lapsa.  When asked how my posts implied yelling or pushing Lapsa, Aero responds by calling it distracting as well, in 353<br>\n\"Is pushing. Pushing. Focusing. Distracting.

Why? What's your reasoning on him?</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nThat post was about my final thoughts on Lapsa as I announced that I was going to basically ignore him for the time being.  I returned my vote to pisskop, whose wagon I had left to vote Lapsa.  Since pisskop was still my top scum read after ignoring Lapsa, my vote moved back to him.<br>\n<br>\nI'm getting a headache trying to follow the pisskop vs. Aero debate.  My overall impression is that Aero is more rational and has better and more consistent reasoning than pisskop does.  pisskop's arguments mostly seem to be of the flavor of \"prove X to me\" while constantly moving the goalposts to invalidate any proof given up to that point.  I don't like the approach, and I don't like the fact that pisskop feels the need to defend himself against every single statement that seems critical of him.  This level of defensiveness is really incredible.  pisskop spends about 90% of his time in this game making sure that every single point about him is answered, usually numerous times.<br>\n<br>\nMy vote on pisskop started with a forced agument where I tried to pick a fight with him/make him look inconsistent, and pressured with a vote.  That was obviously not based on a strong read, just on a whim and a desire to try to prompt some reaction.  As I've said before, I really don't like the overly defensive nature of pisskop's reactions.  So I've kept my vote on pisskop.<br>\n<br>\nThe strongest thing in favor of pisskop being town for me right now is the initial comment he made to me, in post 14.  I just have a hard time seeing scum trying to draw such attention to themselves so early with an unprovoked insult like that.  I can't see what the value would be for a scum to start out that way.  I am much more likely to believe that scum will wait until there is some existing acrimony to latch onto rather than drawing attention to themselves by creating early controversy.<br>\n<br>\nIn the end, I do not have a particularly strong scum read on pisskop.  Call it a slight scum lean.<br>\n<br>\nI agree with Count Dooku that the pisskop vs. Aero thing feels more likely to be town v. town than anything else, and I think his reasons are well presented and make sense.<br>\n<br>\nI'm liking JohnnyFarrar less and less every day.  He seems to like to stir things up but doesn't look to be working in any coherent direction or really trying to scum hunt with any sense of urgency.  That's just how it looks right now.<br>\n<br>\nDespite agreeing with Count Dooku about pisskop vs. Aero probably being town v. town, I don't agree with Dooku's vote on Nickname.  I don't think that replacing out necessarily means anything and to use that as a reason for voting scum doesn't seem very sensible to me.<br>\n<br>\nLapsa does the weirdest stuff imagineable.  Like, voting people just because someone else said they would vote them but haven't done so (post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6653880#p6653880\">323</a> and post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6655873#p6655873\">348</a>), unvoting people just because they said that they think he's town (post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6652525#p6652525\">209</a>), and generally posting one liners that are either nonsequiturs, irrelevant nothings, or unprovoked insults.  But I said I am ignoring Lapsa, and basically I am, from the perspective of trying to decide alignment.<br>\n<br>\nGiven that I agree with Dooku that scum are probably lurking and taking advantage of the pisskop/Aero fight to allow a favorable scum outcome to develop, I'll park my vote on my least favorite lurker for the moment.<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: pisskop</span><br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: West9</span>", "time": "Sat Mar 07, 2015 1:00 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=60961&start=375", "forum": "53", "thread": "60961"}

If someone said this and then a quick wagon brought that X to L-1, I would expect the person who made that statement to be willing to hammer, since the whole meaning of \"I'm down to lynch X today\" means that a lynch of X would be a desireable outcome.  Therefore, I believe that Nickname is making an even stronger statement than voting someone, since voting someone is a transient action that people do all of the time and implies no promise to lynch that person (otherwise, no one would ever unvote after voting).  I believe that it is incongruous with evilpacman18's entire point that town is vote happy, to be so willing to claim an intent to lynch someone so early in Day 1.<br>\n<br>\nNow what exactly about that line of reasoning is incorrect?<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>West9 wrote:</cite><br>\nAlso, talk about why your vote on me isn't just what I said it was in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6657275#p6657275\">387</a></div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nAt the time I put my vote on you it was primarily because I felt like your degree of participation was just enough to seem active without really doing anything, which made you a satisfactory place to put my vote since I am becoming suspicious of anyone with a certain degree of nonparticipation in this game given Dooku's arguments which I think make sense.

Like I think I'd be scum reading him already if I wasn't giving him the benefit of the doubt because of his noobiness. I think Count Dooku is a good example of new town who uses \"common sense\" to come to regrettably poor decisions about reads (IE. \"Nickname replaced out, he must be scum running away\"). BJI just seems to strain to accuse people with poor logic. West9 has some strong points about him in 386 and 387. also in 381 his criticism of Lapsa is followed by the admission that he is ignoring Lapsa, which is kind of damning because previously everything Lapsa did was a scumtell to BJI.<br>\n<br>\nJohnnyFarrar: Lol sorry I should've been clear about the funeral or just not mentioned it.

Perhaps that gets harder as you understand the game better and have stronger feelings about what the right play vs. wrong play is and start second-guessing yourself and then becoming awkward and easy to spot.  I don't know.  But the fact that scum are lynched no more than random chance Day 1 (there is a statistics thread on this site that demonstrates this fact by analyzing 150+ games), I suspect that scum are not easy to detect just by looking for behavior patterns.<br>\n<br>\nWith regards to Aristophanes, who is the topic at hand, I also detected a conciliatory tone in several posts.  I mentioned this in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6667987#p6667987\">552</a>.  I am not sure that I'm willing to conclude that this is evidence of scummy behavior though, because as I mentioned, it could just be personality.  Also if I were scum I would probably pay attention to not seeming too friendly and too avoiding of argument.  Sorry, WIFOM.  It's the killer for me.  I can always add \"but maybe that's what scum wants me to think\" to pretty much every conclusion I draw.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Gliffie wrote:</cite><br>\nI'm gonna go into some more mechanics discussion here.

I had assumed that stating your feelings about players was at least as important as voting, since as people die your thoughts about them can be researched and correlated with your actions or your voting history or whatever.  To be quite frank, I am really unsure about who to vote for.  I have 'gut feelings' but I don't trust them.  For example, I think that SilverWolf is eminently practical and thoughtful which makes me want to conclude she's town, but just wanting to conclude someone is town just makes me want to conclude that she's scum because I believe I'm more likely to be fooled than to get things right.

As you might imagine, my ability to focus dwindled a bit at the end so my reading of the first half to three quarters was alot more diligent than my reading of the last quarter.  I even took notes about every post up to post 440 or so.<br>\n<br>\nI came to a few conclusions:<br>\n<br>\n1. The initial pisskop wagon was good and the consternation surrounding it was suspicious.  Aero, me, and Johnny made strong arguments (well Aero mostly, with Johnny and me sheeping Aero's position).  I don't think that pisskop represented himself well in that entire exchange and I felt like Aero was incredibly solid in, for example, posts <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6650522#p6650522\">145</a> and post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6653946#p6653946\">334</a>.  However, I still conclude that pisskop is town from his work in this thread outside of that particular argument.  I think pisskop vs. Aero was town v. town.<br>\n<br>\n2. Aero/Gliffie is my favorite slot.  I get the strongest town reads from both of these players.<br>\n<br>\n3. My points against evilpacman18 were better than people gave me credit for.  I did not defend myself well against West8 and Ari, but I think my points had merit.  I do not think evilpacman18's post 208 was nearly as good as other people think it was.  evilpacman18 remains a scum lean for me.  I naturally don't like evilpacman18's recent tunneling on me either.  It feels like he has sensed weakness in me and is going for the kill.  But still could be town v. town.<br>\n<br>\n4. SilverWolf over and over again did things that I didn't like.  On first read and in real time I didn't see it as much but on re-read I saw alot more.  I think VictorDeAngelo's points against SilverWolf early on were really good and SilverWolf never extricated herself from them despite trying to appear that she had.  In particular, her discomfort with the early pisskop wagon, her self-contradictory voting of Lapsa, and her post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6653313#p6653313\">248</a> where the 4 players she picked for scum are the lurkiest and least likely to defend themselves.   Also has been contradictory in dismissing my attempts propose scum association in Day 1 while herself doing similar things (noting VDA defending Lapsa).<br>\n<br>\n5. There has been some hypocrisy with people telling me that being anti-town is not the same thing has being scummy, and yet using basically that same reasoning themslves (Ari for example recently basically said that we should lynch Prolapsed Brain if he continues to be so anti-town).<br>\n<br>\n6. I think the case against Nickname was complete bunk, and didn't agree with Dooku on it at all.  I find Ari to be more suspicious than Nickname ever was.  But I am much less inclined to vote Ari than some others at this point in the game.<br>\n<br>\nAt this point, the person I find most suspicious is actually SilverWolf.

Sorry, I don't know how to make a case against the entirety of a player's game without writing this much.</div></div><br>\n<br>\nSilverWolf's early controversy came from post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6648689#p6648689\">96</a>.  In this post SilverWolf calls the early wagon on pisskop fishy and then chooses to vote Lapsa who had been on the wagon but had left it.  pisskop was no longer at L-1 at this point.  The reason given for voting Lapsa was that his reasons for being on the pisskop wagon in the first place was the weakest of any of those who joined the wagon.<br>\n<br>\nWhat doesn't make sense about this to me is that I would expect scum to have had better than the weakest argument for getting on the pisskop wagon.  I would have chosen someone who had actually made arguments against pisskop, not someone who even at this early point in the game was clearly playing some kind of weird strategy that doesn't involve really having or explaining reads.<br>\n<br>\nThis is not a huge mark against SilverWolf, but it's something, and it begins some interaction between SW and VictorDeAngelo that I found interesting on re-read.<br>\n<br>\nIn post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6649015#p6649015\">105</a> SilverWolf defends herself against VictorDeAngelo's assertion that having voted Lapsa, the only person who had been on pisskop's wagon and agreed with SW that the wagon moved too fast, was inconsistent.  She tries to justify her vote on Lapsa in the face of this with the argument: \"because of his bad vote and lack of any other contributions besides that, even with the unvote.\"  Not all of Lapsa's behavior had been revealed at that point, but enough that I wouldn't have called his vote on pisskop to be the strongest or most motivated out of any of them.  Also, the other reason given is \"his lack of other contributions besides that\".  These are two bad reasons given to justify the original bad reason given for voting Lapsa.  The whole vote on Lapsa simply reeks.<br>\n<br>\nPost <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6649664#p6649664\">115</a>, SilverWolf asks pisskop to provide a link to back up his assertion that his position on Aero was based partly on meta.  I just don't like meta and I especially don't like fishing for meta \"evidence\" by asking someone to provide it.  That's just not a sound way to get evidence since you're letting the person you're asking cherry pick it, so it's not particularly trustworthy.  Other people have done this so it's not just SilverWolf, but it is a minor strike against her for me.<br>\n<br>\nPost <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6650203#p6650203\">129</a> again tries to justify her vote on Lapsa with the same reasoning she posted before.  I still didn't buy it, neither did VictorDeAngelo which is why he kept coming back to it.  I agree with VDA in his opinion of her justifications of that vote.  Also in this post, SilverWolf says:<br>\n<br>\n\"I fucking hate it when people twist my words around in games.\"<br>\n<br>\nThis seems exasperated and for no good reason.  I didn't see anyone twisting any words around, simply pointing out inconsistencies that really were there.<br>\n<br>\nSilverWolf post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6651939#p6651939\">191</a>, now claims that she's not interested in voting pisskop, but declines to give any reasons, which is very uncharacteristic of her play in this game.  Weird and suspicious.<br>\n<br>\nPost <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6653313#p6653313\">248</a>, when asked to give her reads, she says \"Lapsa, Prolapsed Brain, Nickname and TMJ all look scummy.\"  Every single one of these players is a lurker in this game.  Despite all of the stuff said by all of the other more active players, she chooses the four players who were least likely to defend themselves.  That is weird.  She also says \"I think VDA's constant defense of Lapsa is noteable.\"  This appears to be an attempt to group her current vote (Lapsa) with her main antagonist (VDA).  Also, this is in a post where the entirety of the points made are reasons that she thinks that the four players she named are scummy.  She says these four sentences about them:<br>\n<br>\n\"Lapsa doesn't like to answer questions unless forced.\"<br>\n\"Prolapsed Brain is trying to take us back to RVS and is too aggro for my taste. \"<br>\n\"Nickname's post are very off-tone, message, etc.\"<br>\n\"TMJ is not reading or paying attention.\"<br>\n<br>\nSaying that VDA's \"constant defense of Lapsa is notable\" is both a misrepresentation (I didn't see it as a defense as much as providing background info because people were drawing conclusions without some of VDA's familiarity with Lapsa's play style), an exaggeration (his \"defense\" of Lapsa was hardly \"constant\") and also meaningless in the context of this post unless she also sees VictorDeAngelo as scummy.  But she didn't mention VDA as a scum read in this post.  It feels like she's angling towards a case against VDA but being very cautious, unnecessarily cautious unless she's afraid of getting into a direct confrontation with VDA.  This is suspicious.<br>\n<br>\nPost <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6653318#p6653318\">250</a>, the very next post, she says \"If you aren't scummy to me you are town or null right now.\"  She didn't mention VDA has scummy so he mist be town or null right?  And yet she tried to link him to one of her scummy reads ...<br>\n<br>\nPost <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6653747#p6653747\">305</a> she responds to West9's assertion that her original post calling the pisskop wagon \"weird\" and voting Lapsa is \"exactly how I imagine scum reacting to an early quickwagon on town\" with \"That's how I always react to someone being put at L-1 too quickly in a game.\"  Really?  So she always reacts by voting someone who had been on the wagon but that agreed with her that it was too quick and unvoted just as she would have done?<br>\n<br>\nIn response to West9's call for evidence that this how she behaves (by the way I also dislike West9 fishing for meta like this, and said as much already), she links to a single game, where she votes for the player that put the other player at L-1, not another player who was on the wagon and unvoted as she would have done.  So this evidence ignores the more important aspect of the suspicion surrounding her early vote on Lapsa.  Also, it's a single link which is so easily cherry picked, not evidence that she \"always\" behaves this way, only that she behaved this way at least once before.  This is why I find West9's acceptance of this \"evidence\" as suspicious, since he basically asked for non-evidence, got non-evidence, and then accepted that in order to unvote SilverWolf.  If SilverWolf proves to be scum, then West9 is going to look guilty by association here.<br>\n<br>\nPost <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6656238#p6656238\">368</a> SilverWolf starts to soften in her assessment of her vote on Lapsa.  At least she recognizes now that it was a bad vote even though she refused to acknowledge it previously.  Also mentions that she went and looked at his last game, kind of a weird time to be looking for confirmation of her argument against Lapsa.  Probably should have looked earlier when actually making the vote, no?  Or maybe when VictorDeAngelo explicitly stated that Lapsa's current play is just evidence of his play style, which she ignored at the time.<br>\n<br>\nPost <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6658273#p6658273\">410</a> \"Are you seriously doing associative tells without a scum flip and trying to pick out partners at this point in the game?\" seems incongruous with previously wanting to note that VDA's defense of Lapsa is \"notable\" when it could have been construed as evidence against Lapsa, where that evidence is only meaningful if it's an associative read.<br>\n<br>\nPost <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6658392#p6658392\">418</a> I simply don't agree with.  In my assessment Aero was the much more rational and consistent side of the pisskop-Aero argument, but disagreeing with SilverWolf here is not alignment indicative, so it more flavors how much credit I give to her scum hunting approach to this game than to specific alignment.<br>\n<br>\nPost <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6658497#p6658497\">420</a> \"I've noticed that TMJ has like 6 posts and none of them really say anything at all really. This is null but I would like more input here.\" this is very weird since TMJ is one of the four players that she bothered to call a scumread earlier.  Now he's null for continuing the same pattern of behavior that had earned him a scum rating previously?<br>\n<br>\nPost <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6661822#p6661822\">472</a> notes that she thinks that evilpacman18's post 208 looks \"very town\".  Well I've already stated how I feel the opposite of SilverWolf about that post.  Continuing to disagree with SilverWolf in her basic assessments of the game starts to be a clue that we may have opposite alignments ...<br>\n<br>\nPost <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6669016#p6669016\">566</a> she makes the unsubstantiated claim that the pisskop lynch is one that he \"obviously wanted\".  This is doubtcasting against Victor whom she had not previously been able to win an argument, so this is the way she choosed to discredit his vote.  Then from the same post, this:<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>SilverWolf wrote:</cite><br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6648834#p6648834\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6648834#p6648834\" data-post-id=\"6648834\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 103</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=23314\">VictorDeAngelo</a> wrote:</cite><br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6648689#p6648689\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6648689#p6648689\" data-post-id=\"6648689\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 96</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=24413\">SilverWolf</a> wrote:</cite>That wagon on pisskop is fishy.

The point was that he found inconsistency in SilverWolf believing this and also voting for Lapsa who agreed also.  Again I feel that SilverWolf couldn't squirm her way out of Victor's points about how her Lapsa vote was bad and again she's chosen to misrepresent Victor's position as a way to appear to have an answer.  And again here's the insinuation that Victor as an \"abormal defensiveness of Lapsa\" which I did not see at all.  All looks like trying to weasel out of arguments she knows she can't win, while at the same time doubtcasting Victor.  Scummy.<br>\n<br>\nThis part of the same post is basically an attempt to weasel out of the losing end of the argument with Victor in the same way that I just described:<br>\n<br>\n\"Then this pile of BS where he basically makes up a bunch of stuff that I didn't do. I explained already why I voted for Lapsa there twice, in detail. To me, he was just angry that the wagon he wanted was derailed.

He's barely contributed anything to this thread at all.\"<br>\n<br>\nFinally, there is SilverWolf's case against Prolapsed Brain.  Her case against Prolapsed Brain is just a rehashment of \"anti-town\" behavior that is not actually scummy.  Such as, that he does not participate enough (I think this must just be how seriously he takes these games, given his stupid and sometimes gross comments, and also how he wigged out when I called him out early on not actually playing the game, which I interpret as a defensive reaction to a statement that he knows is right).  Lots of players do not participate enough.  For example, Lapsa, who SilverWolf also voted for partially the same reason, but then unvoted when she decided that after some investigation this is just the way he plays.  Well why not investigate Pea Brain the same way before coming to the same conclusion that she had to back out on previously?<br>\n<br>\nOK so that's a summary of why I find SilverWolf to be my top scum read.  She will probably have refutations to provide for some or all of this.  The thing is, that it's obviously not her that I need to convince here, it's everyone else.  I've put my evidence up here and it's up to the rest of town to decide how to act on it.  I do want to make it clear that her assertion that I am voting her without reason is false.  She may not agree with my reasons, but I do have them.", "time": "Sat Mar 14, 2015 12:02 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=60961&start=625", "forum": "53", "thread": "60961"}

That you weirdly didn't want to give reasons for voting pisskop was just one of my personal series of minor suspicions.

It was just weird and inconsistent, that's all.<br>\n<br>\nIn fact nothing that I posted about you is 100% confirmation that you are scum.

This is going down in a very suspicious way.<br>\n<br>\nI did not rip anything out of SilverWolf.  She volunteered it.  If my wall is as ludicrous as she claims to believe, then there was no reason to go so far as to divulge whatever sensitive information you guys claim to have in rebuttal to one of my minor points in that wall.  It was unnecessary, I just said so in a previous response to SilverWolf.  It was unnecessary first because if my wall was so unbelievable then she doesn't really need to address it, certainly not to address every single minor suspicion I posted in there, especially one that I already acknowledged is not necessarily alignment indicative.  It was unnecessary second because as I already said, she could have re-iterated that she had reasons that she doesn't want to disclose without specifically quoting the sensitive posts you are alluding to.  And thirdly, it was unnecessary because if she's not going to discuss the posts after putting them up, then it wasn't really evidence that she wanted to use anyway.  How can you present evidence like that without actually being willing to discuss it?  Then it's not really evidence of anything.<br>\n<br>\nHer revealing of whatever sensitive information you are worried about was 100% unnecessary in three ways.

It just re-iterated previous points.

I never said anything rude or insulting to her and in fact all I've done is make a case out of what I read in the game.  Read it all again.  Where did I say anything that is outside of the bounds of making cases within the game?  There was the one moment where I quoted Prolapsed Brain's post where he said that SilverWolf freaks out when voted for, because I thought it was genuinely interesting that she appeared to be not handling the fact that someone built a case against her well.  I thought it indicated that there might be something there.  It was not meant as an attack or an insult, and I'm sorry if it was taken that way.  But aside from that, I see nothing in anything that I wrote that was anything other than point and counter point about the game at hand.  If SilverWolf is genuinely upset by my building a case against her and defending it, then I am genuinely sorry to have upset her.  It is not my goal in a game that is supposed to be 'fun' to make people unhappy.<br>\n<br>\nAnyway, fuck it.

Where was the threat to her?<br>\n<br>\n- VDA's vote could be seen as a legitimate threat since as far as I can tell he's got some credibility in this game<br>\n- No one seems to be taking Prolapsed Brain seriously, especially with regards to SilverWolf, who he poked and prodded without giving any reasons since the time he's been in here<br>\n- No one was taking anything I said seriously at that point<br>\n<br>\nSo she's scum, how does any of this even remotely threaten her?  SilverWolf has played this game many times before, given the posts that others have made hinting as such (I still haven't read any of her meta and I refuse to, we've already been over that), and surely she's played as scum before.  Could she really be such a nervous scum that she truly believed that that sad little wagon was something to get so worried and upset about as to have to freak out and quit the game?<br>\n<br>\nIf she's scum, then she's already mentally prepared for being questioned and grilled and even to have to defend herself against ridiculous newbie pushes (which is what she believed my wall was, she said so).  But if she's town?  She's probably not prepared for that.

She was not frustrated with tone.  She was frustrated at being on a wagon that she thought was ludicrous.  The tone was fine, not at all out of ordinary in a game of mafia.<br>\n<br>\nAlso, why does a scum frustrated with tone replace out?  They come into the game expecting to have to take blows.  When you come in as scum you already have a warrior attitude, knowing that you're one of the minority that the town majority is gunning for.  When you come in as town, you do not have this mentality.  SilverWolf either had a town mentality that got frustrated with someone building a case against her that she felt like she could not escape from even though she knew it was wrong, or she faked it.  If she faked it, well I'll lose to her but also have no respect for her.  Because that's dirty play in my opinion.  I don't think she faked it.

But I note it anyway.<br>\n- SilverWolf got exasperated early and claimed that VDA was twisting her words when I couldn't see how that was true at all.  Suggests feeling like she was trapped in an argument she couldn't win (the unwinnable argument being the one that would rescue her from her bad vote on Lapsa)<br>\n- The whole ~reasons~ thing which was the point of great debate later and lead to the explicit and public outing of pisskop's claim<br>\n- When asked for reads, picked 4 lurkers who were easy targets unlikely to defend themselves<br>\n- Tried to doubtcast VDA and tie him to Lapsa (her at the time lynch vote) by claiming that VDA was \"constantly defending Lapsa\", which was a misrep<br>\n- Tried to support her vote on Lapsa with incomplete, easily cherry picked meta<br>\n- Switched her read on TMJ from scum to null for no reason<br>\n- Tried to further doubtcast VDA by claiming that he 'obviously wanted' the lynch on Pisskop<br>\n- Used the same reasoning in trying to justify a Prolapsed Brain vote as she did for her Lapsa vote, after she already had to back off of the Lapsa vote<br>\n<br>\nI'll admit that most/all of this was weak.  But it was the best I had on a complete thread reread.  I struggle to find anything that I feel is strongly indicative of alignment from anything that anyone says in this game.<br>\n<br>\nIronically, my weak but hard pressed case against SilverWolf caused her to quit in a way that gave me the only solid read I have this whole game: that SW was, in fact, town.", "time": "Tue Mar 17, 2015 9:14 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=60961&start=975", "forum": "53", "thread": "60961"}

I'm actually not that sure what's the best course of action. If he's scum and wants to link a team mate to his fate by pretending to neighborize him, then I'd honestly say go ahead. Deciding who he's gonna neighborize in public and that player getting whacked would also be problematic, so perhaps we should just let him neighborize whoever he wants.

So, you assume that I went into that vote knowing that particular aspect of Silverwolf's meta. This whole chain of events is super unlikely, especially when you consider the number of games I've played on this site and the number of times I've played with Silverwolf before this game (if you researched my meta, you would find that the answer to these inquires are one and zero, respectively).<br>\nAlso, you have to assume that Titus and I were scumbuddies, which is a hard theory to pair with my support of/jump onto the titus wagon at a time when I could have helped the PB/Tjoe lurker wagons gain momentum.<br>\n<br>\nI unvoted for the reason I said I unvoted: Silverwolf provided meta-evidence for her read made me question whether or not my vote was any good.

I  never said you were not allowed to be on the same side of a discussion as a scumread, or that you are forbidden from mentioning her name.

Plus Gliffe still wants to lynch rather than test the claim (which I didn't agree with). So what's the point of this?<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nThe point is that you also could have chosen Gliffie's comments to riff on if you wanted to reiterate that neighborizer might be scum instead of Titus'.  Same point as I've made about 5 times already, and you're responding with the same defense 5 times now.  Nothing new.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>VictorDeAngelo wrote:</cite><br>\nAnd I didn't agree that Ari should neighbourise scum. So again I disagreed with Pisskop.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nI'll give you this.  The original quote that I took from pisskop was irrelevent to my argument, I misread it and thought he was saying that \"Ari would only neighborize scum if he was scum\".  So you're right, that particular quote was in no way evidence against you in this argument.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>VictorDeAngelo wrote:</cite><br>\nWhat Pisskop was on the opposite side. Incredibly bastardly is more than serious doubt and is against what I said (in fact I believe it was that post made me respond in the first place, but I'd have to check and to be frank, I'm not going to bother). Gliffe doesn't have Titus experience on this forum, so his opinion on why would his opinion on what qualifies as a normal role be more valid, I don't get it.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nI'll repeat myself again: pisskop and Gliffie gave plenty of opportunities for making a point about whether or not neighborizer was more likely scum or town.  You chose to focus on Titus' statement and to include an \"even if Titus is scum\" caveat.  It's not damning evidence, of course, it's just suspicious.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>VictorDeAngelo wrote:</cite><br>\nI could literally rewrite probably more than half your posts and make them townier. Does that mean your scum?<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nYour argument here is that because anyone's statements could be suspicious, your statement should not be considered suspicious?  I don't get that logic at all.  Seems like a truism that could be used to defend anything.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>VictorDeAngelo wrote:</cite><br>\nBecause I did. I mean I can't really offer answers for something that happened a week ago. It's not like I spent several drafts trying to get right.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nThis is not really a defense, just an explanation of how the slip could have happened.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>VictorDeAngelo wrote:</cite><br>\nI don't understand the question. Can you rephrase?<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nYour suspicious statement was:<br>\n<br>\n\"Also, even if Titus is scum, she's right that Neighbouriser is not confirmed town, simply liklier town than scum.\"<br>\n<br>\nI pointed out that mentioning Titus here was unnecessary and suspicious.  You responded with:<br>\n<br>\n\"Because people have a habit of turning around after someone flips scum and saying \"Well Titus said that the neighbouriser is not confirmed town, she's scum, so I guess the neighbouriser is confirmed town.\"\"<br>\n<br>\nSo your defense is that you put that \"even if Titus is scum\" there to try to counter anyone's inclination to conclude that if/when Titus flipped scum, to assume that the opposite of everything she said is true.  In this case, the opposite being that neihborizer must be town since she said it might be scum.<br>\n<br>\nOK, so my question was, why weaken your own statement by invoking Titus' name if all it can do is to associate your statement with someone that people would mistrust after she flipped scum?  If you hadn't mentioned her name at all, then your statement could stand alone as your own opinion.  And if Titus flips scum, you can make the point then that her scumminess doesn't change the truth of the statement that neighborizer can still be scum.  It is suspicious to include a distancing clause from Titus in a statement that didn't need one especially given that the clause only weakens the statement anyway.<br>\n<br>\nNow given all of that, I don't think that your response really said anything materially different than your previous response, and I also think that my response here hasn't said anything materially different than anything I've already said, so I think this argument is played out.

And if Titus flips scum, you can make the point then that her scumminess doesn't change the truth of the statement that neighborizer can still be scum.  It is suspicious to include a distancing clause from Titus in a statement that didn't need one especially given that the clause only weakens the statement anyway.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nBecause it doesn't weaken the statement. Scum don't always lie. In fact Titus, as if she's scum, is not going to lie blatantly about the setup like that. Town or scum, she is pretty much going to tell the truth in these circumstances. Plus how do I know I live long to make the statement later.

I don't think my theory is completely implausible still.<br>\nThe thing about SW is that on a second read, knowing she was scum, her frustratedness actually seems really sincere. As if she couldn't see why she was being wagoned when she felt like her partner was being way scummier than her. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6673787#p6673787\">634</a> is really telling. Not to mention the fact that as soon as SW replaces out, Prolapsed follows Titus onto the Ari wagon. Prolapsed should've been playing enough to know that both Ari and SW were really unlikely to be scum. In that scenario they were either both town or one was town and one was the counterwagon. We already know which was which now and if I'm right on Prolapsed then I don't think it's likely that there was scum on the wagon at the time Titus and Prolapsed jumped on it. In other words it was lucky and available for finishing off by scum, who didn't have much part in starting it. This is understandable because the Nickname slot just looked bad and some people found Ari distasteful anyway. This is what I'm referring to:<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6676144#p6676144\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6676144#p6676144\" data-post-id=\"6676144\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 691</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=24704\">Cheetory6</a> wrote:</cite><fieldset style=\"border:3px outset grey;padding:5px 10px\"><div style=\"text-align:center\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#0000BF\">Votecount 1.11</div></div></div></div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Aristophanes</div> [6] - Count Dooku, West9, Gliffie, pisskop, Titus, Prolapsed Brain<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Titus</div> [2] - VictorDeAngelo, bji<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Prolapsed Brain</div> [2] - JohnnyFarrar, Aristophanes<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">bji</div> [1] - evilpacman18<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Not Voting</div> [2] - Lapsa, Tjoe Min Ja<br>\n<br>\nWith <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">13</div> alive, it's <div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">7</div> to lynch.<br>\n<br>\nDeadline for Day One is Wednesday, March 18, @ 10:00 AM EST, which is in <span class=\"countdown\">(expired on 2015-03-18 10:00:00)</span>.</fieldset></div></blockquote><br>\nSo we have a pretty limited pool of potential scum to complete a trio starring Titus and Prolapsed.

However I remember really reading townreading West9 and I think unless Titus was negligent enough to not read SW's freakout and see how much she outed Prolapsed, it's also unlikely that she started to hardbus TJM after SW had tried to hardbus Prolapsed. Which leaves Johnny. I'll go back and check if that makes sense interaction wise later.<br>\nAlso Titus votes TMJ in 743. She wouldn't have a scum read on both of buddies when she was likely to be the lynch.<br>\n<br>\nAnyway that's 25-30.", "time": "Tue Mar 24, 2015 10:54 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=60961&start=1225", "forum": "53", "thread": "60961"}

And furthermore, I didn't see SW yell at ProlapsedBrain during her freak out at all.  She yelled <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">about</div> him, but not at him.  She yelled <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">at</div> me.  She was pissed at me for tunneling on her so hard, although to this day I still don't understand why that warranted a freak out when should could pretty easily have just ignored me since no one was really taking me seriously.  Even if that didn't work she could have <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">tried</div> it and seen if it worked before getting all freaked out.  I just do not understand what she was thinking and hope she explains it in the end game if she doesn't hate my guts too much.<br>\n<br>\nThe only explanations that I have been able to come up with for why she freaked out are, like your explanations, centered on the concept of being frustrated that she was being accused of being scum partly because of actions of a scum buddy.  VDA fits in here because it's his initial points about her bad vote on Lapsa that she didn't seem to be able to escape, not being able to win the argument with him, and then when it seemed it had blown over, I came in and hammered on that point hard again.  Another possiblity is, like you said, Prolapsed Brain, who kept voting for her pointlessly, going right back to her every time (and often voting repeatedly just to irritate her apparently).

He voted her two or three times in a row (without unvoting anyone else, which is strange), then after moving his vote elsewhere, came back to a vote on her slot every time it seemed like there was any momentum at all behind a wagon on that slot.  I don't fully understand the significance of this.  One explanation would be that this was Prolapsed Brain's weird way of bussing that slot, and I guess this would fit in somewhat with SW's frustration, but I'm not super convinced on that.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>evilpacman18 wrote:</cite><br>\nLapsa must've killed Count Dooku because of post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6678868#p6678868\">788</a> and subsequent pisskop attacks.

Pisskop points out why in the next post but does not mention that 800 is not only wrong but scummy. I am mentioning that. Sorry bji, my townread on you was pretty short lived. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Also notice that the first prolonged period of time where bji is not voting coincides with the period of time where Titus is turning out to be the only viable vote...</div></div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nWhat's scummy about it?  My impression was that Ari was on the hot seat and suddenly Titus arrived and took all of the spotlight away from him.  And I didn't see how that could benefit a scum Titus at all, since you'd think she'd be happy to come in and not rock the boat and let a wagon against a town Ari proceed to a mislynch.  The thing I was forgetting was that when Ari claimed, people backed off, and all of this had already happened before or coincident with Titus replacing in (can't remember exact timing and am too lazy to go back and read, but I'm positive that in any case, Ari got off the hotseat independently of Titus replacing in and bringing the focus onto herself with her interactions with pisskop).<br>\n<br>\nI was struggling alot with the SW/Titus slot at the end of Day 1.  First, I had some emotional response to thinking that I had driven a townie SW out of the game and I didn't want to be a further prick and actually lynch that slot, since if SW was town then I'd just be adding insult to injury.  Second, I have the habit of, after convincing myself that someone is scum due to my reads on them, working to look for reasons that they aren't scum because I'm so afraid of being wrong and lynching a townie.  So I vacillate alot between conviction that a scum read is scum and then conviction that they're not.  I have a hard time retaining conviction in this game.  However, I did decide to take a stand on SW's slot being town because I felt like believing that SW would replace out as scum was making an ethical judgement on her character that I didn't want to make.  Turns out I was wrong.  And the two conclusions I could draw are that either SW is really unethical or that it's not unethical for scum to replace out in situations like that.  I'm giving her the benefit of the doubt and assuming it's the latter.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>evilpacman18 wrote:</cite><br>\n828... defense of Prolapsed at the same time as admitting that he has not displayed any intent to make reads.

I wasn't taking PB's play seriously at that point, what with the multiple redundant votes, the weird and sometimes gross comments, etc.  I thought it would be better to lynch someone who I thought actually might be scum trying to masquerade as town via halfhearted scum hunting than lynching someone who really didn't seem to be playing the game.  I still stand by that position.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>evilpacman18 wrote:</cite><br>\nthe thing is bji seems always to work way too hard to be scum. but maybe he just has a lot of time irl. Still leaning way more towards Prolapsed as the scum in the duo.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nYeah I get this all the time, both in this game and other games I've been in.  People always accuse me of trying too hard to be scum, and honestly it baffles me because I'd never try to look scummy.  People just don't seem to understand what it looks like when someone with a minor amount of mafia experience tries hard to scum hunt.  I go down alot of blind alleys, alleys that I am sure players with more experience would never even enter because they know that they're dead ends.<br>\n<br>\nAlso in terms of having alot of time irl, I think there are a few factors at play: 1) I only play one mafia game at a time so all of my attention is on this one.  I think others play many games at once so their time is spread around between games.  2) I am a software developer and I spend all of my time every day sitting in front of a computer and it's easy and natural for me to refresh the mafiascum page every time I'm waiting for a compile to finish, or bored, or whatever.  So in that sense I do have alot of time for the game because I spend 8+ hours every day sitting in front of a computer ready to read or comment on this thread at any time.  That being said, it's having a bit of a detrimental effect on my work and I'm trying hard to reduce my attention given to this game during the work day (no success yet but I'll keep trying).  3) I believe that when I sign up to play a game of mafia, I have an obligation to contribute as much as and as best as I can.  I wouldn't even join the game if I was going to half ass it.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>evilpacman18 wrote:</cite><br>\noverall there's not much to say on 30-35.

The way I see it the two options are that she either freaked out at both her scumbuddies for picking her out as the weak link or freaked out at one of her scumbuddies for doing that and tried to cover it with a second freakout on someone else.

As I pointed out before, he hasn't really made any aggressive plays in my opinion and now that he has a hammer opportunity for a player that he agrees is the best lynch choice, he's declining to hammer.<br>\n<br>\nOne thing I don't understand though, is why does this look bad if TMJ flips town?  Seems to me it would be bad for West if TMJ flips scum.  Why would scum hesitate to hammer town?<br>\n<br>\nSomething needs to happen in this game.  My vote on TMJ is based solely on two factors:<br>\n<br>\n1. The quote I already pointed out where TMJ pays unusual attention to the wagon forming on SilverWolf.<br>\n2. His lurky style is not contributing anything and is only acting as a distraction, and I agree with others that this only becomes a worse distraction for town on subsequent days.<br>\n<br>\nAny one of West, pisskop, Gliffie, or ChaosOmega could be hammering TMJ.

And it's already been explained why you were a good lynch choice for today.  I'm really hoping you flip scum but even if you don't, at least the game will hopefully start progressing.<br>\n<br>\nI don't know if I'll live through tonight so I'll you all something to think about in case I don't:<br>\n<br>\npisskop is either the towniest town or the scummiest scum.  His claim was weird to me.  Scum would make that claim as a sort of a win-win claim: if you're right that there are no investigative roles, then you get townfirmed.  But if you're wrong, then someone either tunnels you or counter claims and then scum knows an investigative role.  Not too bad of an outcome in either case for someone who believed they may really be close to lynch.  However, this is predicated on pisskop really believing that he was close to lynch, and that early in day 1, I don't think anyone would really believe that.  That being said, I always find premature claims like that suspicious.  I also believed that pisskop may actually have been signalling something when he joked about being cop.  I thought maybe he really was a cop and that joke claim served two purposes: one to see if Titus or anyone else would become very interested (which Titus did) to gauge if they are possible scum, and two to let those who can see through the deception know that he's a cop.  I thought maybe he was a day cop who had investigated Titus because of how suddenly and certainly he tunneled on her as scum.  Like, he was 100% sure in such a completely tunneling way that I thought he must be day cop and have investigated Titus and known that she was scum.  I couldn't otherwise explain how he could be so sure.  I didn't think of this until after Titus flipped, obv.  Then in day 2 I was trying to probe pisskop to see if he was as \"sure\" about his read this day as previous, but he wasn't.  So in the end I concluded that he's not actually a day cop.  Like I said, pisskop is either really townie town, or really clever scum who has tricked us with a fake role claim.  At this point, I'm pretty convinced that pisskop is town.  But I wanted to put all this out because maybe fellow town can think of more that I haven't thought of.

I was genuinely worried that the game would die without a replacement willing to come in.  Very good of you, and much appreciated.<br>\n<br>\nI agree that the Pea Brain slot is highly suspicious at this point.  My reasoning is almost entirely based on SW's freak out.  Now that we know that TMJ is scum, it explains alot.  It would seem that SW was upset because she knew she didn't have much of a scum team to rely on.  TMJ was obviously not going to be much help.  It seems very likely that SW felt like the rest of her team wasn't helping or wasn't going to be helpful either, and got frustrated when she, as the only \"good\" player on the team, was the one the wagon was forming on.  So who else would SW have perceived as an unhelpful or maybe even hostile scum partner, to the extent that she felt like she'd rather quit than play with that team?<br>\n<br>\nPea Brain looks like a likely candidate.  His multi-voting on SW almost looks like a really mocking form of bussing.  Maybe SW got really frustrated by that.<br>\n<br>\nI can't leave VDA out either though.  His early interaction with SW could be bussing and SW could have been frustrated that her scum partner had initiated the interactions that ended up making me most suspicious of her.  Like, if they were bussing, I focused entirely on her and didn't even consider that her scum partner, who was equally involved in the bus, could be scum.  I think this is a considerably worse theory than my case against the Pea Brain slot though.<br>\n<br>\nI continue to not understand NK decisions by the scum team though.  Why Johnny?  Why not pisskop (who led the lynch against Titus and I believe has clearly demonstrated some scum sniffing skills and would seem dangerous to scum)?  Why not me (who identified both SW and TMJ as scum)?  Why not Ari (who, if he is town, has a valuable role that is worth NK'ing)?", "time": "Thu Apr 02, 2015 5:19 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=60961&start=1350", "forum": "53", "thread": "60961"}

I did try to explain. Informed is valuable to scum because it rules a number of valuable town roles (cop, tracker, watcher, etc) so it helps them:<br>\n<br>\na) Decide their play. Since scum know that there aren't any chance of being investigated there's less chance of town's being able to PoE and with no night actions, that there's less risk based around targetting a known PR.<br>\nb) Decide their safeclaims. Normals won't give out safeclaims, but if there are no town investigative roles, that means scum could get bold and claim a PR.<br>\nc) Narrow down the setup. Scum hunts PRs and breadcrumbs. Knowing what is, and isn't a viable role helps with that.<br>\n<br>\nThere's also the possibility that your straight lying about being informed, and instead you simply took a stab based upon the scum roles (scum can take a guess at what is and isn't in a game based upon their own PRs).", "time": "Tue Apr 14, 2015 8:43 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=60961&start=1600", "forum": "53", "thread": "60961"}

I kinda had a scum mindset while playing this round, which was a weird experience. Spent a lot of time to appear waterproof, which is not necessary. I'll have to rework my playstyle to be much more impulsive if I want to play another round here. Sorry again for replacing out. Might have cost town the game there...<br>\n<br>\nPretty fucking funny/sad that Pea Brain's slot won the game. Policy lynching him the next time he plays like that. So stupid...<br>\n<br>\nTitus, was the confusion with Pisskop's role legitimate?

Lesson learned.<br>\n<br>\nIt was your arguments with SW at the beginning that tipped me off to her alignment.  I just thought it was weird that someone who seemed so rational when dealing with everything else couldn't extricate herself from her argument with you.  It felt like she was squirming.  Perhaps she really wasn't and I just got lucky.  But the result was her replace out, and then I dropped the ball because after \"soul searching\" I just had to conclude that scum SW wouldn't do that.  Luckily pisskop picked up the ball and drove Titus to the lynch.  After that, you correctly identified TMJ and I saw the same when I reviewed his interaction with SW.  So scum 1 and 2 were \"easy\".  Unfortunately, after that things kind of fell apart with everyone having their own reason to not suspect PB, and to be frank, in the last Day or two (or three) I didn't really think people were putting much effort into trying to figure the game out.
