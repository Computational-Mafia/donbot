Votes must be bolded and in a form similar to <span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: Playername</span>. If I do not see your vote, it will not count. Unvotes are nice but not required.<br>2.) Lynches require a majority of votes (50% of the living players +1). If a 50% + 1 majority is not reached by deadline no lynch occurs.<br>3.) No Lynches require only 50% of the vote to occur.<br>4.) If a lynch occurs, the game enters twilight and players may continue to talk in thread until it is locked and a death scene is posted. No votes/unvotes will count in twilight.<br>5.) Dead players cannot talk. Once you are killed/lynched do not post in thread. Not even a \"bah!\" post.<br>6.) All actions will be resolved using the Natural Action Resolution system.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Deadlines/Activity</span><br>7.) Each Day will have a two week deadline.<br>8.) I will consider deadline extensions on an individual basis.<br>9.) Treat this game as a commitment. If you are going to be V/LA please post in thread or send me a PM.<br>10.) Players must post every 72 hours (unless they have noted V/LA) or they will be prodded. Three total prods during the game will result in a replacement. <br>11.) If a player fails to pick up their prod and post in game within 24 hours they will be replaced.<br>12.) Each night will last approximately 72 hours, during which time all night actions must be submitted via PM.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">General</span><br>13.) Have fun and be respectful to your fellow players.<br>14.) Do not speak about this game outside of the thread unless your role specifies that you may do so.<br>15.) Do not quote anything from the moderator that is said outside of this thread (including role PMs) or pretend to quote anything from the moderator. Paraphrasing is allowed but if you are questioning your paraphrase, run it by me first.<br>16.) If I make a mistake, please address your grievance in bold in thread or in PM. Please point out vote count errors in thread only.<br>17.) Do not edit posts. Do not use invisible text. Do not use small text.<br>18.) <span style=\"color: green\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Green</span></span> is my color. Do not use it.<br>19.) At least one person received the following PM:<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Hello, XXX, and welcome to Mini Normal #1386 - Thirsty Souls Mafia!<br><br>You are a Vanilla Townie.

In my opinion, its not enough to base a case from and my gut isn't getting super-scum from what little he has posted. Perhaps that is because I am not usually as aggressive as most so I can somewhat understand not having a vote out 24/7.  You said to count the number of times he has said something and then hedged it. <br><br>ISO-2 He mentions qwints as \"coaching\", but doesn't vote. Maybe you consider his hedge as saying that it might be his playstyle?<br>ISO-3 He restates his uneasiness about the whole \"coaching\" but doesn't pursue it because the town doesn't believe its important. <br><br>My count is two, if that is what you meant by hedging. He is not contributing to finding scum, that much is certain. Fence-sitting? Yeah, but is that because he hasn't been around or because he is just scum-lurking? So while he hasn't been very helpful, I still think we have better targets to go after.<br><br>Do you think there we any scum on the Monkey wagon - regardless of Monkey's alignment? I would be willing to bet at least one scum-member jumped on, and our lynch today should be on someone from that list as I had originally pointed out. This will be our best bet at lynching scum today. My vote is still on rofl for good reason. He still refuses to talk about the wagon, especially my question as to why he jumped on the wagon.<br><br>@Angry - Then make some content."}

Once there was a wagon, then we could start making reads based on people's reactions and votes. We now have now some interesting evidence to analyze: Monkey self-voted. PM put him at L-1. Lupo was the first off the wagon, and got off while Monkey was still self-voting. Thus we actually have information to analyze that we wouldn't have if everyone sat back and waited. Right now, I think the case against PM is pretty compelling - a vote to put monkey at L-1 and then disappearing seems like scum to me. It certainly deserves scrutiny."}

Once there was a wagon, then we could start making reads based on people's reactions and votes. We now have now some interesting evidence to analyze: Monkey self-voted. PM put him at L-1. Lupo was the first off the wagon, and got off while Monkey was still self-voting. Thus we actually have information to analyze that we wouldn't have if everyone sat back and waited.

And yes, I did OMGUS you, but that's because your quick hop off of the Monkey wagon onto me was very, very suspicious.

We'll never get anywhere if everyone has to wait until they're almost certain to press a case. Pushing wagons then adjusting based on the reactions to those wagons is the only way to get anywhere. <br><br>Prohawk, you attacked rofl for his L-2 vote while writing off PM's L-1 vote as poor play despite the fact that both players voted without giving reasons. Despite this disparity, I liked the fact that you pushed the case on rofl, and I think it's suspicious that rofl hasn't responded. Yet you've attacked cases built by other players on the same or more information, sometimes before the target has to defend himself. After RXK ignored THAdmiral and I's vote in his post 92, you asked us to justify the case and then declared it weak. All before RXK said anything about the attack, and even though you didn't have a null read. Why not let RXK defend himself, which would have given all of us more information to work with? Additionally, as ThAdmiral has pointed out, it's inconsistent for you to give so many null reads and then say \"I like to play is everyone is guilty until proven innocent.\" Neither your analysis of PM's L-1 vote nor your defense of RXK seem like someone treating those players as guilty.<br><br>Prohawk is now a scum read for me. I wouldn't be at all surprised by a Prohawk/RXK scum team. The whole \"I was attacking a case, not saying the target was town\" thing seems very scummy to me. My vote, however, stays on PM until he does something to change my read."}

We'll never get anywhere if everyone has to wait until they're almost certain to press a case. Pushing wagons then adjusting based on the reactions to those wagons is the only way to get anywhere. <br><br>Prohawk, you attacked rofl for his L-2 vote while writing off PM's L-1 vote as poor play despite the fact that both players voted without giving reasons. Despite this disparity, I liked the fact that you pushed the case on rofl, and I think it's suspicious that rofl hasn't responded. Yet you've attacked cases built by other players on the same or more information, sometimes before the target has to defend himself. After RXK ignored THAdmiral and I's vote in his post 92, you asked us to justify the case and then declared it weak. All before RXK said anything about the attack, and even though you didn't have a null read. Why not let RXK defend himself, which would have given all of us more information to work with? Additionally, as ThAdmiral has pointed out, it's inconsistent for you to give so many null reads and then say \"I like to play is everyone is guilty until proven innocent.\" Neither your analysis of PM's L-1 vote nor your defense of RXK seem like someone treating those players as guilty.<br><br>Prohawk is now a scum read for me. I wouldn't be at all surprised by a Prohawk/RXK scum team. The whole \"I was attacking a case, not saying the target was town\" thing seems very scummy to me. My vote, however, stays on PM until he does something to change my read.</div></blockquote><br><br>This seems like a stretch for you... so allow me to refute your argument.<br><br>Thank you for reiterating what I have been saying, however where have I said or even implied that we shouldn't push any case weak or otherwise? I completely agree with your reasoning. So lets go look at the string of posts that you are referencing. <br><br>Post#98 - I asked for a detailed analysis of scum read.<br>Post#102&amp;104 - Details the argument.<br><br>Thats fine, you guys had a case and I added it to my pile of evidence.<br><br>What you and Admiral seem to be forgetting is <span style=\"font-style: italic\">you</span> asked for my analysis in post #107. I had absolutely no need (and would never have even mentioned it) to \"attack\" a read, and I would challenge you to quote exactly where I am attacking said read. <br><br>I do accept that strong cases will not be made Day-1, where have I ever suggested otherwise?<br><br>Please refer to post #115 on why rofl vs PMysterious. There is no disparity in my mind. Again please provide information on which cases I have attacked that are similar to my own.<br><br>You say that I didnt wait for rxk to respond, however if you were really concerned with his response being unadulterated, why were you probing for my thoughts before he responded? Was I supposed to ignore you until then?<br><br>I am sorry you don't like my playstyle, not sure what to say regarding that."}

Rather than give more information to town by making cases against players, you' d rather sit back and avoid any controversy. Accusing and voting is how you get information. Long posts where you play logic games are worse than useless day 1. As for you saying that you're not discouraging people from pushing cases, I don't see how anyone who looks at your iso could agree with your self-assessment. You've tunneled on rofl all day, and failed to do anything else but question other people's cases. <br><br>AP, if he was actually taking a stand on anything besides \"L-2 vote from Rofl is scummy,\" I could see your point.

By refusing to give town reads, you're keeping information from town."}

Almost all of xelath's posts are in response to attacks against him or questions posed to him. He's done very, very little to pressure other players.

Most players have noted AP's hyperactivity and aggressiveness, but Xelath feels the need to keep saying it over and over again without adding anything else to the game. Almost all of xelath's posts are in response to attacks against him or questions posed to him. He's done very, very little to pressure other players. This especially bothers me when he says he has scum reads on players he hasn't interacted with. Why wasn't he pressuring monkey or rofl? That's why my vote is on xelath and that's why other people should vote xelath.</div></blockquote><br><br>You know why that is? It's day one. I'm not a fan of over-analyzing every single word that everyone types. I analyze actions and what happens in the night. All this day one jerking off about intentions and trying to fabricate cases and wagons out of thin air does nothing for me. Most games I would be happy if we picked one person at random, lynched them, and then started on day two with some legitimate information, instead of, \"OMG he said a word I don't like, therefore scum. What's there to pressure? Let's lynch someone, so things can happen at night. That's why there are power roles, to give town information. This game is about information, and so far we pretty much have that MM voted for himself, which is a stupid play, and nobody else legitimately knows anything, which makes all of this posturing really stupid.</div></blockquote><br>This is what makes me willing to lynch Xelath. He wants us to not analyze and just vote somebody?"}

Because not many can understand my logic at the beginning, I am going to avoid my first case of rofl being scum for rolling up the first wagon and move on to ISO analysis of his posts.<br><br>Everyone do a quick ISO of rofl and Ctrl+F Prohawk. In all of his 43 posts, my name is mentioned by rofl 28 times in a derogatory, attacking manner. This doesn't even account for the number of posts he has made against me without directly stating my name. After making his retaliatory attack against me, even when he voted for Xelath (his only other vote) rofl's reasoning had to do with his connection to me. <br><br>Next, take a good look at the people who he views as town and scum. He doesn't give any explicit reasons as to why, so we can only assume as to why. His town reads and his scum reads essentially line up with those who agree with him/support him being town and those who vote against him are scum. <br><br>Post #64 - Prohawk Vote - Scum. - <span style=\"color: blue\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"> Note: I had already made attacks and voted for him </span></span><br>Post #215 - Admiral is Town - <span style=\"color: blue\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"> Admiral voted for had been attacking rofl's target (me) </span></span><br>Post #215 - Qwints is Opportinustic (not necessarily scum or town) - <span style=\"color: blue\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"> This is quite the interesting read. Qwints had attacked rofl's activity in the thread as being different than in his other games (would normally be a scum read for rofl) however in post #210 quints stated \"Prohawk is now a scum read for me\".

That has to be the poorest excuse for a hammer that I've ever heard. Our goal is to lynch scum, and compromise lynches on people you believe to be town are just stupid. You are actively furthering the goal of the scum when you do that. I'd have rather had the game go into a No-Lynch situation so he could actually USE his power. But they \"forced\" you to do it. <br><br><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/seh6p.gif\" alt=\"Image\">"}

STFU you have no way to be arguing that. You just hopped on A{ like you hopped on every other wagon that went by. I'm pretty sure that you've been on a wagon for every player in the game at this point. The only reason you're alive is because nobody else will agree to lynch you. You're the most anti-town person in this game but apparently this is your meta or something. Also, your entire case on me is one big OMGUS because I'm the only one who doesn't buy your shit."}

(While my instinct is that they are unlikely to be scum together, I need to re-read and make sure that impression isn't just based on distancing. I don't think their day 2 AP votes preclude this because of how obv-scum AP was)."}

With the rate that we've lynched people over the past 3 days, a vote after the hammer isn't indicative of anything. Also, it doesn't hurt anything. I'd see it more as an exclamation point on AP's scumminess than evidence of scummery. And I swear, if DC hadn't claimed mason, I'd be thinking he's scum right now, but I guess it's a play style thing. I'm still going to ride the Monkey wagon until he dies. I'm pretty certain he's scum. Especially with his dodging of ThAdmiral's gambit. Town would have nothing to lose on that one."}

However I <span style=\"font-style: italic\">was </span>suspicious of dunham for separate reasons (tunnelling monkey, jumping on prohawk for the lynch) which I didn't clarify at the time, and I regret that I didn't clarify these at the time.<br><br>Day 4 I voted monkey based on the analysis I had done the previous day (post 811). I also genuinely feel monkey was attacking me with fail logic with the whole \"you hammered town so you must be scum, I hammered scum so I must be town\", which only increased my feelings that he was the right lynch.<br><br>Day 5 Is obvious. Since I was being voted it was either me or grey, and I figured out via poe who the scum was and who the town were in post 965.<br><br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>2. There is so much about it that doesn't feel right:<br> - The timing. He asked people to claim yesterday, but didn't claim himself.<br> - The convenience. He never stops a kill the entire game, but just at the end when it could make his claim seem more legit and make me look bad he stops a kill. Note this is the first time he was under any pressure to be lynched, and therefore the first time he would have felt the need to claim. Also note that by stopping a kill now it is still a mylo situation, so he doesn't lose a day.<br> - The reasoning. There are at least 2 glaring examples of targets that don't make any sense at all (me night 3, not demon core night 4), and in fact go completely against what he has said in this game, and his other targets also make little sense (dunham night 1, me for three nights in a row even though he hadn't stopped a kill by blocking me in the previous 2 nights).<br> - The role. Jks and Rbs in the same game (especially for the same side) are rare for a couple of reasons. Firstly they are very similar roles - why give 2 of basically the same role to town, one slightly more powerful than the other? Secondly the interaction between them is very tricky to define - which resolves first if they block each other, for example. Sometimes when a mod plans an rb and a jk in the same game they add a special clarification to their rules i.e. \"role resolution is as follows bus driver&gt;jail keeper&gt;role blocker\" or something like that.<br> - The power. Town has already had 2 masons and a role blocker flip, while scum has only flipped 2 goons (which are like vanilla townies of the scum team). If town also had a jail keeper it would be 4 power roles to the town and, assuming the godfather had some sort of ability like rolecop or maybe strongman, only 1 to the scum, which seems like a bit of a power imbalance to me.<br><br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>3. Yes I frankly think qwints should have been lynched by now based on the mountain of evidence against him, and I'm quite frustrated you and xelath (who chose so well yesterday) are dawdling so much today."}

I know I have things to work on.  Timeliness being one.  I am asking for critique.  <br><br>I want to thank all of the replacements who came into this game.

I plan on modding future games, next being a large normal (so if you want to /pre-in let me know).  I said in the dead thread I would discuss reasoning behind setup.  When I took an unfortunate hiatus from the site roughly a year and half ago the limit for mini's was twelve players.  When I came back it was thirteen, and I did notice a difference in \"common\" setups.  What I mean by this is that with the expansion to thirteen players I have noticed more and more setups being heavy on PRs on both sides.  I wanted to try and do something different.  Yes, it was -a bit- leaning on the mountanious side, but I think if ProHawk wasn't lynched D1 nor Scott killed N1 it would have been fun to see scum play against this.  I have more thoughts, but it's Thanksgiving and the Redskins won so I need to drink to that. <br><br>Cheers!"}

Well done getting replacements sorted quickly.<br>I respect your idea of \"bringing mafia back to its roots\" in a way with a nearly vanilla game. Although some find it less fun when they don't have a night action I actually like it when a game isn't solely decided by a cop outing scum or a confirmed town being protected by a doc and running the show. All the main cases and reads in this game (with the exception of demon core) were based on play/behaviour in the game on not roles which I thought was good.<br>The only criticism I have is that I found it really annoying that you ended days but didn't post the flips immediately. It's a pet peeve of mine when mods come in, lock the game, post that they will put up the lynch scene soon and then disappear. I doubt it would take all that much longer to just say \"xxx was lynched, they were xxx\", and then say \"will put up more detailed lynch scene later\" if you really feel the need.<br>But overall great job, would never have known it was your first.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4494943#p4494943\" class=\"postlink\">post 1040</a>, PMysterious wrote:</cite>YES!

Admiral, if he was AP's buddy, could've easily hammered Xel here given how much he liked the people on the wagon and how little he liked Xel over the course of the game.<br>But another explanation is that he didn't hammer Xel 'cause Xel's his scumbuddy.<br>DC, killed N4, wanted to lynch Xel, and also called out ThAd's BS.

Add in them being the two hammering votes on the Monkeyman wagon, and how ThAd specifically said he was going 1V1 with Monkey, and, well, you get the idea. The dead QT of your game is probably screaming all of these points, and I'd just like to say how much I agree with them."}
