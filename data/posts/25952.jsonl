I might be claiming it's because of Rev's RVS vote on me, but of course that would just be my excuse. So if Rev is town and thinks I'm scum he wouldn't believe that I was attacking him because of Rev's RVS vote. He would know that's false. However, Rev claims to be sincere in his belief that I, Slandaar, AM attacking him because of Rev's RVS vote. Since scum don't need a reason to vote, this means Rev must lying, therefore Rev is scum. </span><br><br>The flaw in this logic is that Rev is just using your example, isn't he? So he has to say \"Oh, Slandaar attacked me for my RVS vote\". He may think that's bullshit, but those are the terms of reference. How else can he conduct the conversation? So he could be town thinking you're scum for attacking his RVS vote (he \"knows\" it's a lie), but he has to talk about your supposed reason, otherwise he could not bring it up at all. And the fact that he voted for you heavily implies that he thinks you are lying anyway."}

This was not a bad exchange to get the game going, in my opinion. I like the ferociousness with which Slandaar has been posting so far. However, I agree with others that Slandaar shouldn't tunnel too much, especially now that the game is rolling naturally. As for Revenus, I know from my first game that Revenus' early game can be quite clunky. I'm not decided on his alignment, but I don't have him pinned on my scumlist.<br><br>Mozamis reads very town, I like his posts. Coincedentally, this post is the best in the game so far imo:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=4758981#p4758981\" class=\"postlink\">post 103</a>, mozamis wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=4758628#p4758628\" class=\"postlink\">post 90</a>, Bacde wrote:</cite>welp this game has now been defined by the rev and slandaar interactions<br><br>I was hoping we could avoid it, but its too late now the game has been defined<br><br>Looks like this is the point where we take our sticks and draw a line in the sand and take sides<br><br>but first I'm going to<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: twitch da woof</span></div></blockquote><br><br>MORE IMPORTANTLY, I'm happy with my Bacde vote after this post. It's basically saying \"Well, who knows whether Slandaar or Rev are scum, but hey, one of them is for the chop! Pity, but can't do anything about it now.\"<br>At best, this is VERY LAZY town. But it looks a bit like scum to me, I think, just hoping town will slide apathetically towards a mislynch.<br>Then, the bizarre vote for twitch.

Rather than dissolving the Slandaar vs Revenus argument, which Bacde claims he was doing, Bacde was actually reinforcing the Slandaar vs Revenus argument.

I can take as much time analyzing this game as I want. It's been only half a day since I replaced in so I find your lurking accusation rather awkard. Do you even know the definition of active lurking? Active lurking is posting without putting content in your post, so effectively not participating while posting nonetheless. The word you're looking for is just regular lurking. However, forming a scumread on someone because they've lurked for four hours is rather laughable. By the way, I don't do gutreads. They suck.<br>Are you seriously suggesting I posted in other games to influence how people see me in this game? That's a modkillable offense. Never mention that again."}

Slandaar has misrepresented what Revenus said by implying that Revenus' post contained a slip - the reference to 'badness'. What I believe Revenus to have said, in fact, was looking at the situation from Slandaar's viewpoint.

While I am sure he had a reason, he didn't explain it in his post (or provide it later, unless I missed it) and only one person voted me with the reason of lurking or something. The only person to provide a substantial (albeit, erroneous) reason was Russian himself. Which is supicious. If he had a legitimate reason such as misrepresentation, why did he wait for a wagon and cite vague reasons others provided (they don't exist) and suddenly claim that I twisted his words (I didn't, but he could have read it this way)? Because he saw a wagon, and he fabricated a reason. When I pointed out his error and voted him, he said \"Oh, I'm not paying attention.\"<br><br>I don't buy that. My vote stays."}

However, let's look at that reason:<br><br>Post 120 Delta cites my ISO and says I asked general question without really participating. Which is, honestly, a fair reason. However, his later post 173, he revotes me because of my own inactivity. Which cannot be helped. However, a lack of activity is not scummy, it's being a lurker. (Which is not the case here as I am not intentionally lurking, I didn't have PC access. This cannot be proven and should be irrelevant because . . .) town can lurk. What motivation is there for my lurking since I've responded to any meaningful point brought against me. (Which, as far as I can tell, is the point made by Russian, erroneous though it is).<br><br>The only other meaningful point to which I can reply is Delta's vote posts, but I have nothing to go on. There is little benefit to me or the town in responding directly to his criticism, and my attempt to more actively participate in the game is an action which entails response by ceasing the action with which Delta took issue. Until he posts again and expands on his point (or refines it, whatever), then I have nothing more to say on the matter. <br><br>This being said, my statement that no reason exists for my vote *is* slightly erroneous. My point on Russian, however, does not strike me as less valid despite my overstatement. <br><br>Votes on me: Bacde looks like he just wants someone else lynched. Bacde has made favored Rev over Slandaar in an either or situation, and he favors Russian over Twitch in an either or situation. I don't see any original scum hunting here. <br>Limo votes me in 113 with the thought that a vote on me is more pressing than Russian. I don't really see what his point is,what makes it pressing, or find any reason to take this vote seriously. I am fairly certain this, however, was the first vote on me and it still strikes me as meaningless.He eventually calls me out on fence sitting, which is fair except there hasn't been much to comment on outside of the slandaar/rev debate. In my defense, can anyone really explain what Slandaar has spoken about? I am not following and I doubt many people are. His posts have been so erratic that I do not understand almost anyone point he claims against Rev. (In theory, I think Limo could have made his remarks about a number of people in this game and made it a warrant a vote at that point in the game.)<br><br>Contrary to what I just said, I realized Mozamous seems to understand Slandaar's point. That being said, he voted me for a weak ISO. See my point about Delta. <br><br>I don't really have anything else to say on this at the moment.<br><br><br>Side note: Bacde voted me in post 90 because I was \"lurking.\"  That would make him the first vote on me, my bad."}

Ztife is a player who has done absolutely nothing. And by that I really mean NOTHING. Just ISO him to see what I mean.

Help me lynch 'not-me.'\"<br>Plus, Bacde's means of keeping people off him appears to be calling them town (see post 348, and he only considers Rev is scum because Rev advocates lynching lazy town.)<br>And of course, he indicates I'm good with a Ztife lynch despite the fact that the only problem I had with Bacon this game is his vote on Ztife. (I don't have a problem with his supicions of me because they don't look like a scum trying to contrive a reason to vote me. He looks town motivated.<br><br>I don't recall why, but I said Don was my strongest town read. I realize that at this point it's mildly dangerous to say that because part of the laughing man's case is our \"connection\" but from my perspective, he and I are the only sane players in the game. I would include Slandaar in this list, but since I still don't understand most of his case on Rev, he can't be included here.<br><br><br><br>And as for a \"that's it for now point\"<br><br>I'm being voted by The Laughing Man on the basis that I thought Don looked town. Well, in my quaint corner of the world, people who recognize misrepresentation and then accurately portray what a person tried to say (or did say in this case) is way more townie than just not interfering. This was no an instance of responding on my behalf, he simply corrected a misrep. And its weak town because while scum don't need to do it, its easy townie points one can gain by doing it. So, I find your vote on me weak. <br><br>However, I don't have much of a problem with what remains of your case. The link between Don and I that you have percieved is noteworthy, but it doesn't lend itself to much credit until one of us flips. It will certainly be useful if you guys lynch me today (and based on the information it would give, it's not a bad idea.)<br><br>I will come back and expand more on this, but I'm trying to configure my desktop computer (I'm wired in right now to get drivers) for a wireless adapter and worst case scenario, I'll be back tomorrow when I get my laptop back from the repair shop."}

Given the experience Don has, I can't see it being the second, and Mac's posts in response to Rememberance's pressure from post #649 through to #670 look like genuine irritation rather than a Scumward AtE.<br><br>If I'm totally honest, I think Limo is scum. His play is very, very reactionary, and the case he makes on SD seems to stem mainly from the fact that SD thought Limo was scum. It's an OMGUS that has been largely obscured due to long, reactionary, contentless posts, and short, irrelevent and, yeah, contentless posts.<br><br>Keyblade looks like a Null-Idiot. I'm going to pretty much ignore him until he starts posting content that can be used. Definately a lynch candidate for today or tommorow, given the amount of coasting he's done. Additionally, Limo made a half-hearted attempt to push a wagon on him further in his #838, which he dropped quite suddenly to join the DJ wagon, which was also half-hearted, given his commitment to a SD case, so I think my favorite lynch candidates are Limo and KBW.

With this, you're essentially just widening your horizon and not taking a strong stance - even though scum has flipped. Pretty not so townie, dude.<br><br>Delta's explanation is extremely lackluster. First, your perspective is not one that of town. Town doesn't make a case and start with well-poisoning words that obviously come from a subjective view. \"...demonstrates a desire to shift the blame for potentially bad lynches onto others...\" is one such instance. It's even harder to read if he pulls out nonunique reasoning like \"potentially bad lynches\" because there's always a \"what if...\" element to something.

He posted a scummy post, and my reads changed.<br>Fourth, if you think my end of the day actions come from scum, you need to be doing one of two things: reread up on mafia theory if you're town, and stop being so scummy if you're scum. From a scum perspective, tell me why I'd say the things I did; why I'd ask if I'd get town cred, why I'd bus in the most awkward fashion in the world, and any other questions you may have. This isn't too much WIFOM as it is an application of Occam's Razor. Simplicity is best option - scum know this. That's why they won't draw themselves into the spotlight with ridiculousness and be under scrutiny.

What? <br><br>What does your case on Limo actually consist of? Are you saying he's a scummy townie, or scum? It looks like you're trying to defend his alignment and you talk about it in very, very definite terms here. I'm quite open to a Ztife lynch after that post, to be completely honest.</div></blockquote></div></blockquote><br><br>vote please?"}
