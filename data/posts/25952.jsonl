While I am sure he had a reason, he didn't explain it in his post (or provide it later, unless I missed it) and only one person voted me with the reason of lurking or something. The only person to provide a substantial (albeit, erroneous) reason was Russian himself. Which is supicious. If he had a legitimate reason such as misrepresentation, why did he wait for a wagon and cite vague reasons others provided (they don't exist) and suddenly claim that I twisted his words (I didn't, but he could have read it this way)? Because he saw a wagon, and he fabricated a reason. When I pointed out his error and voted him, he said \"Oh, I'm not paying attention.\"<br>\n<br>\nI don't buy that.

However, let's look at that reason:<br>\n<br>\nPost 120 Delta cites my ISO and says I asked general question without really participating. Which is, honestly, a fair reason. However, his later post 173, he revotes me because of my own inactivity. Which cannot be helped. However, a lack of activity is not scummy, it's being a lurker. (Which is not the case here as I am not intentionally lurking, I didn't have PC access. This cannot be proven and should be irrelevant because . . .) town can lurk. What motivation is there for my lurking since I've responded to any meaningful point brought against me. (Which, as far as I can tell, is the point made by Russian, erroneous though it is).<br>\n<br>\nThe only other meaningful point to which I can reply is Delta's vote posts, but I have nothing to go on. There is little benefit to me or the town in responding directly to his criticism, and my attempt to more actively participate in the game is an action which entails response by ceasing the action with which Delta took issue. Until he posts again and expands on his point (or refines it, whatever), then I have nothing more to say on the matter. <br>\n<br>\nThis being said, my statement that no reason exists for my vote *is* slightly erroneous. My point on Russian, however, does not strike me as less valid despite my overstatement. <br>\n<br>\nVotes on me: Bacde looks like he just wants someone else lynched. Bacde has made favored Rev over Slandaar in an either or situation, and he favors Russian over Twitch in an either or situation. I don't see any original scum hunting here. <br>\nLimo votes me in 113 with the thought that a vote on me is more pressing than Russian. I don't really see what his point is,what makes it pressing, or find any reason to take this vote seriously. I am fairly certain this, however, was the first vote on me and it still strikes me as meaningless.He eventually calls me out on fence sitting, which is fair except there hasn't been much to comment on outside of the slandaar/rev debate. In my defense, can anyone really explain what Slandaar has spoken about? I am not following and I doubt many people are. His posts have been so erratic that I do not understand almost anyone point he claims against Rev. (In theory, I think Limo could have made his remarks about a number of people in this game and made it a warrant a vote at that point in the game.)<br>\n<br>\nContrary to what I just said, I realized Mozamous seems to understand Slandaar's point. That being said, he voted me for a weak ISO. See my point about Delta. <br>\n<br>\nI don't really have anything else to say on this at the moment.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nSide note: Bacde voted me in post 90 because I was \"lurking.\"  That would make him the first vote on me, my bad.", "time": "Wed Mar 06, 2013 10:28 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=25952&start=200", "forum": "53", "thread": "25952"}

Maintaining a vote solely (or almost entirely) because someone is lurking is good for getting them to participate, but it does nothing once they are participating and you don't see them as scummy. The other question is WHY are they lurking? Would it have been more advantageous for Twitch to lurk as scum or town? Avoiding WIFOM here is hard, so the best you can do is pressure and take from that what you can.<br>\n<br>\nEnd result: lurking is anti-town, but it isn't scummy. It doesn't give reads.

Help me lynch 'not-me.'\"<br>\nPlus, Bacde's means of keeping people off him appears to be calling them town (see post 348, and he only considers Rev is scum because Rev advocates lynching lazy town.)<br>\nAnd of course, he indicates I'm good with a Ztife lynch despite the fact that the only problem I had with Bacon this game is his vote on Ztife.

I realize that at this point it's mildly dangerous to say that because part of the laughing man's case is our \"connection\" but from my perspective, he and I are the only sane players in the game.

Well, in my quaint corner of the world, people who recognize misrepresentation and then accurately portray what a person tried to say (or did say in this case) is way more townie than just not interfering. This was no an instance of responding on my behalf, he simply corrected a misrep. And its weak town because while scum don't need to do it, its easy townie points one can gain by doing it. So, I find your vote on me weak. <br>\n<br>\nHowever, I don't have much of a problem with what remains of your case. The link between Don and I that you have percieved is noteworthy, but it doesn't lend itself to much credit until one of us flips.

Given the experience Don has, I can't see it being the second, and Mac's posts in response to Rememberance's pressure from post #649 through to #670 look like genuine irritation rather than a Scumward AtE.<br>\n<br>\nIf I'm totally honest, I think Limo is scum. His play is very, very reactionary, and the case he makes on SD seems to stem mainly from the fact that SD thought Limo was scum. It's an OMGUS that has been largely obscured due to long, reactionary, contentless posts, and short, irrelevent and, yeah, contentless posts.<br>\n<br>\nKeyblade looks like a Null-Idiot. I'm going to pretty much ignore him until he starts posting content that can be used. Definately a lynch candidate for today or tommorow, given the amount of coasting he's done. Additionally, Limo made a half-hearted attempt to push a wagon on him further in his #838, which he dropped quite suddenly to join the DJ wagon, which was also half-hearted, given his commitment to a SD case, so I think my favorite lynch candidates are Limo and KBW.

If you seriously think that incriminates me, then you need a check-up. There will probably be no changing your mind if I said the buddying was obviously a joke and if I called your \"town triangle\" dumb, inherently flawed, and bullshit. With this, you're essentially just widening your horizon and not taking a strong stance - even though scum has flipped. Pretty not so townie, dude.<br>\n<br>\nDelta's explanation is extremely lackluster. First, your perspective is not one that of town. Town doesn't make a case and start with well-poisoning words that obviously come from a subjective view. \"...demonstrates a desire to shift the blame for potentially bad lynches onto others...\" is one such instance. It's even harder to read if he pulls out nonunique reasoning like \"potentially bad lynches\" because there's always a \"what if...\" element to something. Second, not making an effort to scumhunt isn't alignment indicative.<br>\nThird, you quoting a post made by me where I'm voting KBW is supposed to...what? He posted a scummy post, and my reads changed.<br>\nFourth, if you think my end of the day actions come from scum, you need to be doing one of two things: reread up on mafia theory if you're town, and stop being so scummy if you're scum. From a scum perspective, tell me why I'd say the things I did; why I'd ask if I'd get town cred, why I'd bus in the most awkward fashion in the world, and any other questions you may have. This isn't too much WIFOM as it is an application of Occam's Razor. Simplicity is best option - scum know this. That's why they won't draw themselves into the spotlight with ridiculousness and be under scrutiny. It's why ridiculousness is generally a town tell.<br>\n<br>\nI'm also not understanding why Super is town. Reread his ISO and it's full of shit.

There will probably be no changing your mind if I said the buddying was obviously a joke and if I called your \"town triangle\" dumb, inherently flawed, and bullshit. With this, <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">you're essentially just widening your horizon and not taking a strong stance - even though scum has flipped. Pretty not so townie, dude. <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">&lt;- Omgus FOS, Also illogical since the result of the flip does not effect the statement, if he knew the result (because he was scum) his \"blame placing\" is also another way of saying \"You get all the credit, you're awesome!

It's even harder to read if he pulls out nonunique reasoning like \"potentially bad lynches\" because there's always a \"what if...\" element to something. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Second, not making an effort to scumhunt isn't alignment indicative.</div> <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">&lt;- Omgus Fos and yes it is, it's like one of the primary scum tells</div><br>\nThird, you quoting a post made by me where I'm voting KBW is supposed to...what? He posted a scummy post, and my reads changed.<br>\nFourth, if you think my end of the day actions come from scum, you need to be doing one of two things: reread up on mafia theory if you're town, and stop being so scummy if you're scum. From a scum perspective, tell me why I'd say the things I did; why I'd ask if I'd get town cred, why I'd bus in the most awkward fashion in the world, and any other questions you may have. This isn't too much WIFOM as it is an application of Occam's Razor. Simplicity is best option - scum know this.<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"> That's why they won't draw themselves into the spotlight with ridiculousness and be under scrutiny.</div> It's why ridiculousness is generally a town tell. &lt;- <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">He builds a case on himself (he was almost a non-entity day 1), and then points out exactly why Superdeclan is not scum, because he's running all over the place and doing things, Limo has interpreted this as \"Terrible scum,\" but he has nothing to back this up with. Furthermore, he has ignored Slandaar's reason for why he can't be scum (because it makes no sense for Superdeclan to call Don the SK if he were his scum buddy)</div><br>\n<br>\nI'm also not understanding why Super is town.

Up until #33, you have no claim to being even nearly useful.<br>\n<br>\nNinja'd: I'm not seeing why you're so reluctant to put a vote down.
