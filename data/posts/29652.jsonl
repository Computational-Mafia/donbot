The reason? According to medical report, you are very mentally unstable. The society found some of you very dangerous to keep you guys around among them, so they decided to confine you here. At first, you could understand the society's action. You know you are dangerous. You even beat someone up before out of pure rage before! Living in this building was better than going to prison. Or so you thought at that time. As a day pass by, you get more angry. What did you do to deserve this? The food is terrible, the administrators force you to work all day, and your bed is only not even queen-sized. You must be raging again. You're very unstable, remember? Hell. Who cares? You need to get out of this building. This building is just like prison, disguised as your \"home.\".<br>\n<br>\nBut the administrators. They won't just let you out that easily.

If you don't like the early-game, post later.  It seems like he's checking in and giving himself an excuse not to be taken seriously early-on rather than anything else.  The objective purpose of that post is to excuse his behavior, and that's potentially scummy.  <br>\n<br>\nThat being said, all early-game suspicions are inherently forced early on. Do I think I've nabbed sure-fire scum with my vote?  Absolutely not.  However he's made an opening post that I want a response to, and when he responds, I'll go from there.  <br>\n<br>\nMy goal right now is not necessarily to be 100% correct, but to pressure the right people and to generate as much information as possible to transition into a more \"serious\" phase of the game.

I've only played in one game on this site, and getting out of RVS was quick and feasible because people started to throw around more-than-RVS suspicions early-on.<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5073915#p5073915\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5073915#p5073915\" data-post-id=\"5073915\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 40</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=16917\">Z7-852</a> wrote:</cite>Ok we are still at random voting stage.

First off, \"I guess we'll hop on the wagon too.\" The phrasing of that sentence feels scummy for two reasons: first, the fact that it's prefaced with \"I guess\" feels noncommittal, similarly to the above, but more explicitly. Second, the fact that the vote is described as a \"hop on the wagon.\" There is no wagon at this point - there's only a single vote. Now, Team Rocket may have been referring to the wagon of \"people who interpret Z7's post differently.\" I don't think so, however, considering the vote. The fact that it was described as a hop on a wagon when it really wasn't makes me feel like TR just wants to be seen as being the player who will hop onto a wagon to try to get momentum moving. I.E., it seems concerned with appearances. I also don't like the interpretation of the quote, as interpreting it as asking people to stop pressuring him ignores the fact that it's a perfectly valid response to what Naomi and I were saying. In fact, this sentence says nothing about people pressuring haphauli - all it's talking about is how people interpret Z7's posting. \n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5077578#p5077578\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5077578#p5077578\" data-post-id=\"5077578\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 106</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=21955\">Team Rocket</a> wrote:</cite>Nul, you're being ridiculous.

The primary reason for that is... well, first let's assume there are 3 scum in the game. From your point of view, if you are town, that's 12 other people to read, with a 3/12 = 1/4 shot at hitting scum. As for associations, there are 12 choose 2 = 66 possible different pairs of people that aren't you, and only 3 pairs (scum A + scum B, scum A + scum C, scum B + scum C) that are correct. I.E., if you accuse two players of bussing, your brute odds of being right are 3/66 = 1/22. Essentially, what this means is that, in <div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">very vague</div> terms, you should be about 5.5 times more \"confident\" in scumtells that you see between people you think are bussing than you would be in scumtells on an individual level before you declare the people in question to be probably bussing. Even if it's the only scenario that the two hydra's heads agree is likely... well, see my next paragraph. Plus, you would still need to have <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">extremely</div> strong justifications for calling it a bus, or as Carl Sagan said, \"Extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof.\" <br>\n<br>\nFurthermore, there is no \"inherent\" way to distinguish between a T -&gt; T interaction and a T -&gt; S interaction, because a townie will act based on what they THINK of the other person's alignment, not based on what the other person's alignment actually is. So hunting for interactions by characterizing the interaction as TvT or TvS as opposed to characterizing the individuals involved as town or as scum is also very silly. I mean, you could theoretically try to characterize a person's behavior as scum talking to a townie, but at that point, you're saying much more about that individual than you are about the person you're saying is town, so you're basically reading them on an individual level. <br>\n<br>\nIf you want to say \"I think this interaction is scum V scum\" that's all well and good. However, your actual actions (by which I mean votes) should NOT be motivated by thinking that X is a bus <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">on day one before anyone has flipped</div>.

Also cherries question (though not clear) could very well be interrupted as a 'what are your reasons' As the only way Cherry could change so she didn't look scummy to Nul would be to listen to what Nul had to say about her being scummy and react to it, the way nul answered just makes me question <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">what was going on in your head at the time nul?</div><br>\nRightfully, the next post on this was Cherry saying that they shouldn't have to ask someones reasons to suspect them, As they should say it, and would say it if they was working towards lynching.<br>\nNul then said <blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div> You should ask me for the reason, because you can gather information from me which can help you determine my alignment. Right now, it feels like you don't care about my alignment enough to question me on my reasoning, perhaps because you're not really trying to find out ponies's alignments in this game. It seems like you purposely avoiding me the why question to make it seem like you don't care I'm suspecting you, which is something only a scum would do. </div></blockquote> Now, What is off with this post is a number of things. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Firstly</div> he states that when putting suspicion out a player, the person Fos-ing Doesn't have to supply a reason, Which means the player doing it (nul in this case) Shouldn't give information to the entirety of the town why they feel someone is acting scummy. This is obviously wrong. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Secondly</div> he follows up his statement that as the attacker, he don't need to supply reasons with saying its the defenders job to get the information out of him, but once again, this means he thinks he can attack others without giving town information as to why he is doing it, which is a bad thing. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Thirdly</div> He says by not asking for something that he should of given anyway, that Cherry has no interest in his alignment. I think this is a awkward as if cherry dog had no interest in his alignment why would she have responded, there was no reason to respond to the original post where no information was given other than your suspicious. which not responding is neither town nor scum. by giving a answer she showed interest in what he had to say on the topic.<br>\nNul clarified in the next post that Cherry seemed to be purposely avoiding asking why.<br>\nCherry dogs answer though, was confusing <blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Doing default behaviours like asking for whys is a boring techique, I'd rather get this information about you from not asking that question.<br>\n<br>\nSimply asking why is the boring solution that will presumably put me into defence mode, and that then distracts from how well ponies are able to actually read.</div></blockquote> I don't understand why one would go out of your way to not ask the simple question, though I think by this point Nul should have said of his own free will, I do wonder why he is holding back. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"> Cherry, Why don't you ask the obvious questions that will more quickly progress your own reads?</div> even if it would make you out a little defensive, its a lot better for town as a whole to have the information on why nul felt that way, and would potentiality allow you to counter attack back.<br>\nnul: <blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div> Your defence for not asking me why I suspect you, is because you think asking why is a boring technique. Then why have you made no other attempts to gather information from me? </div></blockquote> I think the debate above here shows an attempt to read your alignment though a 'backdoor' method, strange as it is, your attacks on her are giving information about you regardless, and her answers direct them selves to wanting you to continue.<br>\nPost 91 and 92 are a re-tread of the two posts where cherry says she shouldn't have to ask, and nul says that she has no interest in his alignment.<br>\n<br>\nAt this point I looked though all the posts. It took null 2 days and 13 reasons to provide any reasoning for His suspicion on cherry, and he didn't really have a reason, it was just reaction fishing. (or so he says, im doubtful about that)<br>\n<br>\non the next post, cherry states that null cant really build a proper attack with any reason behind it.<br>\nand then null says it restricts cherries information not his own. I have no IMO on either of these posts, I honestly don't know who would get the most gain from such information the Defense, to know the reasons and defend themselves, or the offence to see the reaction of the defender and to press onwardly on his attack. I do however believe, that with neither party asking/giving information on suspicion its bad for the entirety of town, and essentially a stalemate. without information on why you think someone is suspicious none of town can act. IMO it is always the attackers job to give the information on why they are voting, Fosing or just stating a scum read. without that information no one can make connections, or choose a side to take (I take cherries side because I didn't know his reason to vote).<br>\nThe second part of his post says that cherry should of asked why to see if he was being opportunistic. but given that cherry hadn't really done anything to be suspicious (IMO) and the only vote was from him, and he had given no reason. I don't see how anyone could call it an opportunistic vote.<br>\nCherry agreed with what i wrote about opportunism. cherry once again stated, that if he wants a mislynch he'd have to say why. so she don't need to ask.<br>\nNul responds with a quadruple post. <blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>You still should want to know the reason why unless you don't believe in the scumtell that scums makes bad/opportunistic cases.</div></blockquote> Reading though here, I can see no point that cherry ever stated she didn't care, or want to see his reasons. only that he should be the one to write it, this while on first glance looks valid, but is not really, as it has no grounds in cherries text.\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div> It's my job to provide scumreads, but it's town's job to find out if ponies are scum or town. One of the ways to do that, is to investigate ponies for faulty logic or opportunistic thinking. The fact that he doesn't care enough to question me has me thinking that he already knows my alignment, which is only possible for scum. </div></blockquote> This awkward thing. \"It's my job to provide scum reads, but its town's job to find out if people are scum or town\" ... Mission statement for day time scum right there. Give scum reads, let town judge. but that obvious thing aside (that I don't think was intentional, though pretty bad) <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Nul, How can town make judgements on your scum reads, if your not providing the information needed to make judgements? the reason.</div> the other part of that is speculation and I can ask, how does one ask questions when there is yet to be a reason behind it.<br>\n3rd post, typo correction<br>\n4th post, just saying, that the defender should ask why again saying its the 'natural' thing to do. and although maybe natural for you, not everyone see's a vote on them and right away asks why. (I know I didn't)<br>\nCD:<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I believe both alignments are capable of making what seem like bad and/or opportunistic cases. But I take it you're now saying that's what your reasoning is?</div></blockquote> I have no idea what you are meaning by the reasoning bit.<br>\nCD:<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>If you're part of town - then you're failing at your job of trying to get your scum reads lynched.</div></blockquote> I agree, while having the entire argument with cherry, he didn't comment on other things going on. (the argument I had ect.) while cherry at least responded a few times (though the majority of the posts did focus on Null)<br>\nCD:<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>My natural reaction is to ignore, as I did when I saw your vote, you then wanted to engage me, so I responded by asking you what you wanted me to do about it. (Which I've now worked out was to ask why) </div></blockquote> I do this as well, so agree. Ignoring votes without reason just seems like the natural reaction to me.<br>\nNul:<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Some of you seem to think I'm trying to lynch CD based on my case. No, I don't want to lynch him, I'm simply putting pressure and pushing tor information. It's only early game, so having weak cases is going to be inevitable.</div></blockquote> that statement makes me feel like this entire breakdown was pointless, but If it was so pointless, <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Nul, why did you continue the argument for so long? didn't you get the reaction you needed a fair bit before this?</div><br>\nNul: <blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div> Except I wasn't trying to get you lynched, I was trying to see how you react to pressure and use that information to determine your alignment. </div></blockquote> This looks to be like he is trying to back out of his push, seeing that it was not working. I dislike it.<br>\nCD: calls nul a lair<br>\nNul: says he was reaction fishing<br>\nCD: <blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>So I should therefore have asked why, got no true answer and voted you?

I agree that different people handle pressure differently and I agree with most of what you said in general.  HOWEVER, I think in this specific example Nul is right.  He made a statement designed to prod a response out of Cheery [something I do a lot].  Cheery could have responded in any number of ways but chose to ask how he could change Nul's <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">read</div> of him instead of changing his <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">mind</div> about him.  Obviously, you *could be* right and this could be a simple playstyle thing.  However, I picked up on that phraseology during my read through, too, and thought it was awkward.  That's why I don't understand people voting for Nul because he pointed that out.  I think he SHOULD have followed up on that - as he did - and Cheery should have simply been more forthcoming with his response in stead of making this about the question as opposed to the intent.  Seriously, that whole thing should have been resolved in a couple of posts instead of devolving into a multipage crap fest.  It looks like a childish ego thing and can be a distraction.  I know I was guilty of getting baited in to doing this recently as the result of an ego war and in retrospect it was not good for the Town.

Neither of those are helpful to town. Then he gets replaced by Yates. Yates, RVS vote at post 206, really? What the hell is wrong with Naomi getting involved into things not directly addressed to her? If she has an opinion, by all means she should state it. Nothing anti-town in commenting on other people's reads. Posting associative tells is a null-tell - town may do it to boast with it post-game, or if they think they've spotted something they believe to be important. Scum may do it to try to chain up lynches. Most of the time associative tells are meaningless on Day 1, but can matter later in the game. Why are you so obsessed with Naomi? I think you need to broaden your horizon a bit and look into all players, not just people who posted recently and your predecessor's ISO. <br>\nI think this player is trying to legitimately scumhunt, but over way too tight spectrum, and is bringing up the wrong reasons.

If I get shot, or people go to lynch me) I'm fine to let other people answer there case's too, and im not stopping them, but I will speak up If I feel something is worth commenting on. Also, im not sure what you mean by torpedoing scum hunting attempts, but there is nothing stopping someone continuing on, and if there was a solid enough case I might not help the defender, So Far I defended Hapa, cause Z7 attempted to make his post something it wasn't. and I defended CD for nul attacking him for not asking reasons for a vote he declared as 'I think your scum' without any other reason (One post later, after cherries post) On team rocket.

Besides, even if you're defending someone else, you're adding to the conversation, and i can see how it'd be interpreted as anti-town but it really isn't, seeing as it both adds insight into the alignment of the person being attacked and can be used to glean information about the defender's alignment.", "time": "Sun Jul 07, 2013 6:04 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=29652&start=225", "forum": "53", "thread": "29652"}

Naomi stole the cheese.  See what I'm saying?  You can't just assume all scum players are smart.  People making mistakes is how you win this thing.

I think I understand what Hap was trying to do [which is kind of refreshing, actually] and Naomi sticking her nose in screwed it up.

Your posts make more sense from the mindset of town than from the mindset of scum. This can be easily checked by doing an ISO 2 times, first with \"knowing\" a person is scum, second with \"knowing\" a person is town, and compare what you think makes more sense. I think your reads are genuine and you are playing this game on the town side. Of course it's a preliminary feeling, and it can be a little distorted since I looked mostly into individual strings of posts and not followed the game as a whole. Remember, I am a late-ish replacement.<br>\n<br>\nI think I have a strong town read on Yates at this point. Hapahauli may have been looking for phantom clues in Z7's post, but sometimes Mad Eye Moody townies do that, too. While MEM townies are pretty bad for the town when lynch time comes, and may eventually turn into attractive lynches, I think Yates is a vast improvement over Hapa and you should take into account his posts.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\"><span style=\"text-transform:uppercase;font-size:smaller\">_____________________________________</span></div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Cheery Dog -vs- Nul</div> <span style=\"color:darkred;font-size:smaller\" title=\"This text is being given out-of-character.\">(MORTAL KOMBAAAAT!! *insert musical theme here*)</span><br>\n<br>\nWithout regards to the thread as a whole, I had first read CD's ISO as town and Nul's ISO as scum. I think Nul's obsession with \"what do you want me to do about that\" instead of \"why\" is a ridiculous thing to hang onto, and I really can't believe he's been sticking with an RVS-esque vote for the entire game and insists on it. Nul's horizon is extremely myopic, and his gameplay can be summarized with the following:\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Cheery, you're scum. Why didn't you ask me why? You asked the wrong question. You really did. Why did you ask that question. That's the wrong question to ask. I think the question you asked makes you disinterested in my opinion. Cheery, you are surely scum. I don't want to lynch you yet, but I'm just saying you're scum so town will find reasons to lynch you. You voted for the 3-fluff-posts-and-sheep lurker? Holy shit, that's insanely scummy. VOTE: Cheery Dog. Pitoli and bestwill, show some activity. It's ridiculous to lynch a lurker D1. Miss, why so scummy.</div></blockquote>\nTL;DR Nul IS NOT scumhunting. He's not even backseat scumhunting. He's doing something vaguely described as backseat-proxy RVS tunnelling up to page 11.<br>\n<br>\nIn contrast, Cheery Dog is doing what I believe to be legitimate scumhunting and actively trying to nail down a Mafia.

Moreover, he has consistently voted for whatever wagon was strongest at the time of his post (which suggests he is paying at least some degree of attention) without providing any reasoning (which suggests he doesn't care who gets lynched).<br>\nNow could his next post be some massive wall where he analyzes the shit out of this game and looks super town? Of course, but looking at his full body he looks scummy. He's definitely not one of my top scumreads - that would be CD and Reecer - but you can't deny that while his content has been minimal the content he has provided is not pro-town and is in some cases scummy.  Also I think Miss Stranger's point about scum pretending to be VI's is something very important to consider as well. Moreover, ideally if he is town more votes will pressure him to you know act more townlike.<br>\n-ac", "time": "Mon Jul 08, 2013 4:39 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=29652&start=300", "forum": "53", "thread": "29652"}

For starters I have essentially defended 3 people at this point (Team rocket, CD, Hapa) which means It can't be scum defending scum mathematically it wouldn't add up. Secondly, If I withhold information on reads, and how an argument influences my reads on people; I'm withholding Information from town, that town could use to there advantage later (eg. If I get shot, or people go to lynch me) I'm fine to let other people answer there case's too, and im not stopping them, but I will speak up If I feel something is worth commenting on. Also, im not sure what you mean by torpedoing scum hunting attempts, but there is nothing stopping someone continuing on, and if there was a solid enough case I might not help the defender, So Far I defended Hapa, cause Z7 attempted to make his post something it wasn't. and I defended CD for nul attacking him for not asking reasons for a vote he declared as 'I think your scum' without any other reason (One post later, after cherries post) On team rocket.

Scum has the disadvantage of knowing who is an isn't scum - a fact that is fairly difficult to mask.

I've only played in one game on this site, and getting out of RVS was quick and feasible because people started to throw around more-than-RVS suspicions early-on.<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5073915#p5073915\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5073915#p5073915\" data-post-id=\"5073915\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 40</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=16917\">Z7-852</a> wrote:</cite>Ok we are still at random voting stage.

If you don't like the early-game, post later.  It seems like he's checking in and giving himself an excuse not to be taken seriously early-on rather than anything else.  The objective purpose of that post is to excuse his behavior, and that's potentially scummy.  <br>\n<br>\nThat being said, all early-game suspicions are inherently forced early on. Do I think I've nabbed sure-fire scum with my vote?  Absolutely not.  However he's made an opening post that I want a response to, and when he responds, I'll go from there.  <br>\n<br>\nMy goal right now is not necessarily to be 100% correct, but to pressure the right people and to generate as much information as possible to transition into a more \"serious\" phase of the game.  In fact, I'm somewhat amazed how little sympathy you have for this mentality given your post here...<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5074976#p5074976\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5074976#p5074976\" data-post-id=\"5074976\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 58</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=19768\">Naomi-Tan</a> wrote:</cite>Yes, I suspose it wasn't the greatest logic, but it mad some thinking and was not random. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">I really struggle in RVS so like to do anything to end it, even if it means putting myself in the line of fire.</div></div></blockquote>\n\nWhat gives?

By saying what you just said though; your suggesting that you struggle with early game, even though it was never stated before hand in order to project a unsympathetic light upon me, or more so, being hard on someone who is trying to end RVS. however, RVS (IMO) ended before you vote, so I took it as a real vote. Additionally, I was Sympathetic to the source post, as I have said things like that in the past and believe its still on my profile. which is why I was defensive over your attack and turned suspicion on you for transforming a post that everyone else had said nothing about and just accepted as a normal perfectly harmless comment into something worth a real vote.<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: hapahauli</span> <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Given what he turned Z7's post into,</div> and the fact that his reaction to me questioning his post was to turn back upon me and try to say I'm unsympathetic to him as he was bad at early game, despite no earlier mentions of being bad early game.

Instead Naomi, knowing Z7's alignment, didn't make this connection, but prematurely leapt to his defence (i.e. 'white-knighting'), not realising that this had defused what was in the eyes of a townie an opportunity to hunt scum (thus revealing her hidden knowledge of his alignment?). The fact that she doesn't realise WHY people are telling her not to defend people prematurely is more telling than the defence itself. Yates and ffer both tell her that white-knighting is bad, but she takes it as an accusation that she's defending her scumbuddies, again not realising that in their eyes she, in fact, hindered a potentially fruitful line of questioning.<br>\n<br>\nAs to the point about her meta: it was meant to be little more than an addendum to what was in my head a moderately convincing case. It was something I noticed while scrolling through her past games, but of course you make a valid point given the chronology. However, there are less than two weeks between the end of her last town game and the beginning of the following scum game, with what I find to be a noticeable change in tone. People certainly change over time, and I won't disagree with the point that your tone is a function of your mood, but I would at least put to you that with a gap of two weeks, your alignment is more likely to cause a change in your style or tone than your life circumstances. If I compare this game to her most recent ones as either alignment, I find significantly more similarities to her scum-game.", "time": "Thu Jul 11, 2013 12:09 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=29652&start=375", "forum": "53", "thread": "29652"}

So what do you think about her explanation that she mostly wants to back up ineff in this game?</div></blockquote>\nI think it's near-certainly true and bears precisely zero meaning with regards to the hydra's alignment, given that it sounds like it was something that was mediated before they received their role. <br>\n<br>\nMy natural reaction to the bolded part of z7's post is one of largely \"meh.\" Honestly, if I saw hap's post and thought it was a bad representation of z7's, i would absolutely jump on it before z7 could respond. Furthermore, i can understand naomi interpreting post 59 like that. I think her not understanding what people were saying when they told her not to \"torpedo scumhunting attempts\" might be a product of English not being her first language (which, iirc, it isn't). In other words, i think you're misunderstanding her, when she says that she literally does not know what other people are saying, as her saying that she knows what they're saying but doesn't understand it.

Unless you are scum defending, you need to let ponies answer cases against them for themselves [unless it's something obvious, of course] and stop torpedoing scum hunting attempts. That's straight up anti-Town play.</div></blockquote> Not to be overly defensive, but This here strikes me as wrong. For starters I have essentially defended 3 people at this point (Team rocket, CD, Hapa) which means It can't be scum defending scum mathematically it wouldn't add up. Secondly, If I withhold information on reads, and how an argument influences my reads on people; I'm withholding Information from town, that town could use to there advantage later (eg. If I get shot, or people go to lynch me) I'm fine to let other people answer there case's too, and im not stopping them, but I will speak up If I feel something is worth commenting on. Also, im not sure what you mean by torpedoing scum hunting attempts, but there is nothing stopping someone continuing on, and if there was a solid enough case I might not help the defender, So Far I defended Hapa, cause Z7 attempted to make his post something it wasn't. and I defended CD for nul attacking him for not asking reasons for a vote he declared as 'I think your scum' without any other reason (One post later, after cherries post) On team rocket. I looked though, but.. it was just too clumsy to be considered scum play to me, the vote train still stands for that though.<br>\nI'm overly defensive <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\"></div></blockquote>\nThis actually gives a fair bit of insight on why I think she's scum. Scum has the disadvantage of knowing who is an isn't scum - a fact that is fairly difficult to mask. I wouldn't be surprised if Naomi was also defending her scumbuddy TR, but it is mostly scum that makes the mistake of thinking they can score town-cred by defending an attacked townie. Ignoring the fact that she messes up Z7 and Hapa (panic!), she tries to defend herself against the accusation of defending her scumbuddies, when it's rather the white-knighting that gives her away. Trying to shrug it off as her being overly defensive doesn't help. Since she knows the people she's defending are town, she doesn't understand Yates' evaluation that she is disarming scumhunting attempts by answering in someone's stead. </div></blockquote>Yes, I messed up the name of the two lurkers, it was hard to rememeber, and if I thought it was relevent I might of gone back to look it up. <blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>\n<br>\nIf that didn't come together as I wanted it to, all it really takes is a bit of meta (note that she doesn't appear to have anything particularly recent on-site, but I do think my point holds):<br>\n<br>\nTwo most recent town games:<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?t=23948&amp;f=53&amp;st=0&amp;sk=t&amp;sd=a&amp;user_select%5B%5D=19768&amp;user_select%5B%5D=0&amp;user_select%5B%5D=0&amp;user_sort=Go\" class=\"postlink\"></a><a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?t=23948&amp;f=53&amp;st=0&amp;sk=t&amp;sd=a&amp;user_select%5B%5D=19768&amp;user_select%5B%5D=0&amp;user_select%5B%5D=0&amp;user_sort=Go\" class=\"postlink\">http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.ph ... er_sort=Go</a><br>\n<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?t=23717&amp;f=50&amp;st=0&amp;sk=t&amp;sd=a&amp;user_select%5B%5D=19768&amp;user_select%5B%5D=0&amp;user_select%5B%5D=0&amp;user_sort=Go\" class=\"postlink\"></a><a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?t=23717&amp;f=50&amp;st=0&amp;sk=t&amp;sd=a&amp;user_select%5B%5D=19768&amp;user_select%5B%5D=0&amp;user_select%5B%5D=0&amp;user_sort=Go\" class=\"postlink\">http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.ph ... er_sort=Go</a><br>\n<br>\nBasically, she is more relaxed and fun than here.

Also really like <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5099862#p5099862\">Post 236</a>. Really really really really disagree with a lot of the case on her; I took a quick skim-glance through the linked scum game and don't see her play there being remotely similar to this at all. Also think \"Defending someone that's being attacked\" is a terrible and misused scum-tell (For instance I defend my town-reads to death do they part as town and less-so as scum so the \"White-knighting\" argument is shite.)<br>\n<br>\n4. <div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF00\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">I'm confident Implosion is town;</div></div> I'd like to think I can read him very well (I don't think I've ever been wrong on him?) and his play here is Town!Implosion to a tee. His <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5074282#p5074282\">Post 51</a> mirrors my thoughts exactly at that point and like the <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">\"Also itt, Naomi continues to be town.

Really most of my town-read on the slot though is based around Sera, I think his reads and the way it's all phrased in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5115710#p5115710\">Post 384</a> is genuine and while I disagree quite strongly on his case of Naomi the entire case really comes across as if he believes it and the meta element of it is supertown in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5115986#p5115986\">Post 387</a>.

I think the hydra-disagreement in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5100185#p5100185\">Post 237</a> reads genuine and I think the meta-case on Pitoli in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5105731#p5105731\">Post 274</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5112571#p5112571\">Post 329</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5113267#p5113267\">Post 333</a> reads townish especially <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">\"I'm a little concerned that a replace-in game is not a good comparison, which is why I want to review some games where she was there from the start and town.

Also I don't have a large sample size for the interesting scum-tell but recent experience shows that it has been something scum have done very frequently and looking through this game it's done by Cheery, Bestwill, Team Rocket (A lot), Metal Sonic, Miss yourself and NFC with the first four being people I have various degrees of scum-reads on.

Haph's slightly scum-sided for what I still believe is bad reasoning against N7 (Stating things beyond your control that may stop you from playing for short periods of time is very important, and saying you struggle early game is entirely fine as long as you can show that and get more involved later), though I'll congratulate him for completing the full transition out of RVS.</div></blockquote>\n\nAnd in his next post, I had somehow gone from being possible flip town/scum to town again. not sure how a useless post in his eyes improved things or for what motive he had ... but whatever.

The early attack by Reecer on Nul may sort of fit that pattern, although it's wrong that Nul was in a particularly \"weakened position\", rather the vulnerability of Nul came later (with e.g. his argument with Cheery). The next post focuses on Naomi not liking how Reecer dismisses her posts, and finally she basically paraphrases why Reecer came after and voted Nul, while mentioning that not a lot of it is original. I really don't see much of a case here for Reecer being scum. Parts of his play have been weak, sure, but suspecting people of scumslips like knowing how many scum there are has become pretty standard site-meta, and he at least seems to try to develop his reads.<br>\n<br>\nImp takes most issue with Reecer's questions in 162, but I disagree that his questions are simply for the sake of questioning.

Magua's tried explaining his scum-read on Reecer for me (I think he'll be posting in here tomorrow morning) and I can see where he's coming from with it I just disagree with his conclusion; that said it has weakened my town-read on him quite a bit but I'd still prefer a PPP lynch over Reecer by a long way. We also seem to be disagreeing more and more on Cheery, there's nothing inside Cheery's ISO that really makes me think he's town (But there never really is...) and while I wanted to just trust Magua's read on him I hate his reasoning behind it, it's essentially \"His style of abrasive posting almost exactly matches mine, point for point. He's trying to antagonize people to get reactions from them, and I read it as very legit.\" and \"I find his thought process easily readable and I find that he agrees with my reads, which in turn makes me read him as town.\" and I'm not getting either of those and find that interaction-wise with my scum-reads and process of elimination wise he works decently well as scum. And then there's TR who I had a strongish scum-read on earlier but there's a few things of theirs that read town, for instance <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5105289#p5105289\">Post 258</a> and I did some reading into Ac-meta as scum and there's not really anything like that in his scum-games and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5121311#p5121311\">Post 491</a> where I think Elyse's reaction to the scum-read reads town and like the \"Even if we get lynched scum in X/Y/Z\" portion.<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5124765#p5124765\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5124765#p5124765\" data-post-id=\"5124765\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 533</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=17299\">pieceofpecanpie</a> wrote:</cite>So if she hasn't been scum-coasting to you, what is she then?</div></blockquote>\nThis isn't her only game and she hasn't posted anywhere on the site in three days which means her 'lurking' or 'coasting' so to speak is completely non-alignment related and shouldn't be a large reason behind a change from \"Weak case on her and distracting\" to \"Good lynch\" at all. And again your whole \"Looking on-wagon\" theory makes zero sense and still reads as massively scummy to me, I'll run through it one more time; the only way you can potentially think that the people on-wagon are more likely to be scum is if you're confident that Reecer is town (You're not) which means that the people on-wagon should be just as equally likely mafia as the people off-wagon.

I initially marked down that they're not of the same alignment when I read their interaction, but I've switched my reads on which one is scummier several times.

I believe a couple of players who have had more involvement in a guaranteed mis-lynch (Nul's slot) and a potential one (Reecer's wagon) have more to offer with their flips.

The second issue I have with the post is that you've really rushed your conclusion, you've just gone \"Here are four current scum-reads\" without putting any reasoning together behind why you think each of them is scum, for instance even with your Miss Stranger read in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5130610#p5130610\">Post 644</a> you've not mentioned Roberts replace in and play inside the slot at all but kept the slot in your scum-pile; if you had a scum-read on the slot you'd be wanting to scumhunt every replacement in that slot to evaluate it and get a solid read but you're not.<br>\n<br>\nThere's also another reason that I think PPP is scum here but I can't 'say' it and it's not easy to explain too so if people can read between the lines you might see what I'm pointing towards.

I gave slight townpoints for townreading Nul, #217 and #532.  On the downside, I didn't like #340's commentary on lurkers because of how he's been playing and I didn't like how in #418 all he could comment on was a throw-away comment by MS over other more relevant things.  <br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\"><br>\nNull to Leaning Scum:</div></div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\"><br>\nYates:</div>  I disliked the points made against implosion because they didn't seem legitimate to me - this isn't necessarily alignment indicative but it made me wary nonetheless.  I thought his 'sticking to his guns with MS and TR' #496 was inconsistent with his previous statement that his primary scumreads were Naomi and MS.  After Nul was revealed as town it's looked like he's hung back and posted little pokes and prods now and then and I don't see why MS replacing out influences his read on him.  Nothing overtly scummy here, but also nothing overtly Townie either.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Team Rocket:</div> Didn't like anything about #77.  The whole way they went around saying Nul and CD were maybe bussing didn't quite sit right either.  #243 seemed potentially town-motivated in putting someone off the table (Naomi) without making a big thing of it whilst also pushing a scum-read and I did like that post.  The most dubious thing of all is how CD didn't make the list of scum in #293 (which was {Reecer, bestwillcui, NEC, MS, Pitoli}) given previous statements, and how NEC was in that list despite only being mentioned once before in RVS.  NEC was then replaced by CD in the list in #491.  <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Robert2424:</div>  I didn't think Miss Strangers' reads matched her conclusions and I didn't like the way Nul was pushed that much.  Robert didn't add anything to the slot but I am aware I could be having playstyle issues here, so the read is mainly based on Miss Stranger.  I need more information to solidify this one way or another.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">pieceofpecanpie:</div>  I think the position over the Reecer wagon was suspect - the whole 'it's okay for him to be lynched but I don't like the wagon' vibe didn't sit well.  His lack of pushing forward a viable alternative was also somewhat scummy.  I'll wait and see what else he digs out for now, though, since posting reads/content near death might be Townie.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Likely Scum:</div></div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">morph the cat:</div> Serrapaladin raised some good points on this slot.  Most of their posts are filler - definitions, talks of hydra experience, excuses for not being around, etc.  The meta-explorations of Naomi and pitoli don't really come to any particular conclusions and the reasonless hop on the Pecan wagon and then hop onto Naomi didn't sit well with me.  I don't feel genuine scumhunting from this pair and I feel like the fferyllt head in particular is struggling to pretend to scumhunt as she defers to Ineffective's reads a few times but also her new partner who pointed out a dodgy post by Robert.  Even as the quieter member of the squared hydra (and given how active that one was, that isn't saying much) in HxH mafia, she contributed independent, concise and incisive statements on a fairly regular basis that I am not seeing here.  The meta-analysis there was less mechanical and came to more of a conclusion too.  <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Metal Sonic:</div>  I find his play to be quite different to his play in HxH mafia.  He uses vague qualifier words like 'at the moment' and 'maybe' and his reads almost all have a reason attached if not overly compelling since they're generally fairly waffly.  In HxH he didn't really use these terms and had a more blunt and antagonistic way about him.  He also got a little defensive over fluff posting here which also didn't happen in HxH despite his fluff posting rate being a lot higher over there and never really caring or changing his behaviour despite plenty of negative feedback.  He seems more self-conscious here and more trying to look like a Townie rather than being the 'I don't give a damn' Townie he was in HxH.", "time": "Wed Jul 17, 2013 3:52 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=29652&start=650", "forum": "53", "thread": "29652"}

I think you're wrong on Metal Sonic too but it's late and that's hard to explain so tomorrow I'll do it but if your town-read on Reecer is based solely of interactions not working as a scum-team with Metal Sonic then I think that reasoning is wrong; what's your read and thoughts on him ignoring interactions?<br>\n<br>\nI'll be going over PPPs <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5131036#p5131036\">Post 653</a> and TR's <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5131196#p5131196\">Post 656</a> again tomorrow when Maguas around.", "time": "Wed Jul 17, 2013 4:11 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=29652&start=650", "forum": "53", "thread": "29652"}

Enormous catch-up posts are against my religion, but I have a few thoughts I think are worth mentioning.<br>\n<br>\nI don't think Reecer is scum.  By incredible coincidence I've actually played with him before (Karma Mafia; Effulgence linked this game earlier) and what I recall of his play there was extremely similar to his play here; he was lynched for it (over my lukewarm objections) and flipped town.  I think he is simply a player who has difficulty establishing his own reads and tends to coast until called on it, at which point he proceeds to force them, which makes him look scummy.  I will try to look over this game later and do a closer comparison of his play there to his play here, but I want to get this post up asap as it's been over 24h since I replaced in.<br>\n<br>\nI'd like someone to explain to me why people think Cheery Dog might be scum.  He was one of my strongest townreads at the beginning of the game, although recently he's faded into the background a lot (and needs to stop doing that).  If people are upset about said fading, fine.  If there's something else I'm missing, it would be nice if someone would point that out.  I've also played with him before and, from what I remember and have observed again in this game, he is a player with unusual linguistic habits and thought processes that make his posts feel \"off\" and his motives difficult to understand at times.  I do wonder if this might be behind much of the suspicion of him.<br>\n<br>\nI'm currently most interested in lynching pieceofpecanpie.  Effulgence has raised a number of good points against him that I won't reiterate, but I would also point to his strange passivity and his difficulty explaining his reasoning (despite obviously being very articulate) in response to some of Effulgence's attacks.  When questioned about his reasons for disliking the Reecer wagon, he answers:<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5124820#p5124820\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5124820#p5124820\" data-post-id=\"5124820\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 536</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=17299\">pieceofpecanpie</a> wrote:</cite>Mmmm, the kind of reply I want to make will have to wait till my day off tomorrow.<br>\n<br>\nFor the record, Effulgence, be consistent with your use of quotation marks eg. you've gone from directly quoting me to paraphrasing in your own words.

Either as a town or scum move. Mind-boggling. If you take it into context with my wagon and potential flip, then it secures her a town-ish impression if I flip town and a scum-ish impression if I flip scum (I agree with Eful's previous logic towards this). However, as I know I'm going to flip VT I find this extremely frustrating, because her posts have a lot more issues to them than is deserving of town credit. Therefore I'd prefer to take the claim as a non-alignment tell, as I find the likelihood of Naomi putting together a gambit like this for town points unlikely.

Shamrock - haven't really noticed this slot because it didn't do much til recently, which is suspicious but not outright scummy<br>\n3. Cheery Dog - come to think of it, haven't really noticed Cheery either, which is weird because we've played before<br>\n4. Naomi-Tan - I can see why people find her scummy but I think it's just playstyle tbh<br>\n5. serrapaladin - for recent activity I think Town<br>\n6. Reecer6 - can't tell if a bit silly or just pretending<br>\n7. Yates - like hapa's input more than Yates's. Didn't know that was possible.<br>\n8. Kalimar - Honestly your slot's been the scummiest fucking thing all game. I was shocked to my boots when Nul got mod-confirmed, and your playstyle just reads scummy to me for whatever reason.<br>\n9. Team Rocket - Scum, for reasons I hope to be able to get into more<br>\n10. goodmorning - Town. I saw her role PM.<br>\n11. pieceofpecanpie - Town for meta reasons again<br>\n12. implosion - A tricky one to sort. I'd really like to say I think he's Town but I just don't know.<br>\n13. Effulgence - I've never played with Magua before, but I know that Reg is very very good.

{"number": 814, "id": "5153065", "user": "surviva316", "user_id": "22006", "content": "Why Team Rocket Is My Biggest Suspect:<br>\n<br>\nRight from the early going, my notes on him have always been that he is getting involved with a lot of bandwagons with very little content to support that (except for just going along with what others said, and those arguments he's backseated have often buggy which supports that he's more concerned with rubbing elbows with townies than with scumhunting; I can give more specific examples if asked).  It could just be bad villagering, but I differentiate it from, say, Naomi-Tan because he is not putting his neck out there.  Just kinda going along with the town's sentiments on issues.  Even when Naomi was bandwagoning, she put her neck out there by saying, ~&#8220;I'm doing this because I'm bandwagoning, which is good to get us out of RVS.&#8221;  TR is mostly just going, ~&#8220;Yeah, I'll go with this guy that the town is already not okay with for these reasons that mirror the reasons that the town is going after them.&#8221;   I can't find a single example where he went against general town sentiment at the time.  Loved Naomi when others had expressed they loved Naomi, was ~2 to just about every bandwagon without great reasoning behind it, etc.  Those were my early notes.<br>\n<br>\nThe times that he was pressed to actually stand on his own legs, I've hated what he's had to say.  First example is with bussing/hydra discord on CD reads/general thoughts on Nul vs CD, but I'll save that for now.  The next example is when he's pushing for BestWillcui (with 3 already on the wagon) Post 308: <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">\"Firstly this is not a very good hypothetical since this entire game would be different if we were scum (because our role would be different and so would at least one other role in the game which would probably cause the vast majority of posts to be different)<br>\n<br>\nAnd while I could see a potential scum player pushing a lynch on a potential town bestwillcui pushing a lynch on him<br>\n<br>\nBut that doesn't mean bestwillcui doesn't still look scummy? Like people (or at least I) are suspicious of him for broader reasons than just \"he's lurking.\"<br>\n<br>\nI feel like we're wasting our time arguing about this.\"</div><br>\n<br>\nTranslation: ~&#8221;Let me open with an oblique point involving chaos theory because what the fuck else could I open this post with that would be more of a derail of this discussion.  Anyway, while you are right that it would be good for the scums to lynch him . . . (sentence dissolves into unintentional grammar fail).  Other people think BestWillcui is scummy, and I agree.  That's a good enough reason to lynch him.  Let's lynch him.&#8221;~*<br>\n<br>\nIt's like 3 scumtells rolled in one.  Deflection, counterpoint that never ends up being a counterpoint, total backseating, and then finishing on deflection again.  S/he just doesn't feel that comfortable on the spotlight<br>\n<br>\n*NOTE: ~&#8221; means that I am paraphrasing or, in this case, taking the piss quite a bit with what someone's saying.<br>\n<br>\nGame style remained static throughout the day.  Just rubbing elbows with all the town picks.  Not starting any bandwagons himself, just saying, &#8220;I could see that, vote!&#8221;  (Sorry, I notice that I'm starting to repeat myself, but the fact I note this 3 different times over the course of one day seems worth leaving in my working notes).  MOST IMPORTANTLY 3 of those people he voted for on Day 1 are confirmed villagers from my perspective: Nul/Kalimar, bestwillcui/PoPP, Reecer/me (this logic obviously doesn't work from other players' perspective, since I am not a confirmed villager as far as you guys are concerned).  All 3 of these players gathered large bandwagons (I'm pretty sure the 3 largest wagons of the day), so these aren't to be taken lightly.  Townspeople make mistakes of course, but the fact that all of these were with limited reasoning and just coast along with the town's general sentiments at the time make this a very problematic record.<br>\n<br>\nI actually really REALLY like a TR/CD scum combination.  You can't expect scum to play completely transparently, so why not throw CD on there as one of his many suspects.  One fellow scum on a list of 5 is right about the sweet spot for a game this size, and he is the one that he never votes for.  Not only do they not vote for CD, but they hedge their bets by having hydra disagreement on the matter, by pointing out as part of their indictment that CD does play unorthodox in general and by introducing CD as a suspect as part of an unlikely (as far as the town is concerned; impossible as far as they're concerned) bussing scenario.  All of this makes this very easy to revoke when any actual pressure actually comes on CD, especially if Nul has already come up villager at any point.<br>\n<br>\nOnly problem with this is that CD's very first non-RVS vote was for TR (first vote was for Rhyx/Good Morning).  The post where Cheery made this vote (7/3, 21:33 #129) Cheery uses the hydra disagreement on whether to vote Nul or CD as his reasoning.  Again, this is something that CD can easily go back on once TR explains their point better or just moves on from the bussing idea altogether.  This also comes at a stage in the game (still RVS-ish) and a situation (OMGUS-ish) where they can both move on quickly to better targets whenever the town inevitably gets bored of the Nul/CD interaction, and sure enough, they both did.  Cheery had unvoted within two pages and about a day and a half, conveniently enough as part of a reaction to discredit someone else who was voting TR (granted, it was a very easy vote to discredit, and if anything scum should actually defer to letting this one slide and let others point it out).<br>\n<br>\nI know I'm spending a lot of ink on a very early association theory, but TR makes a lot of sense, and he works in some scummy pairings with our PoE pool.  For now I like lynch TR today, lynch CD tomorrow until convinced otherwise.", "time": "Wed Jul 24, 2013 5:39 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=29652&start=800", "forum": "53", "thread": "29652"}

{"number": 816, "id": "5153116", "user": "surviva316", "user_id": "22006", "content": "On Naomi-Tan Being a Poor Suspect:<br>\n<br>\nRight from the very very beginning, I've had Naomi-Tan tagged as just a bad, &#8220;I see the scumminess in everyone&#8221; villager.  Though I have my reasonings for this in the beginning of the day, I think the case strengthens as the day moves on.  In the first 10 pages, she's jumping on everyone's case, starting lynchwagons, jumping on lynch wagons, implicating everyone, etc, but unlike TR, she's leading the charge, being assertive and is really putting her neck out there, frequently going against town sentiment.  She even makes a bold point when she's jumping on wagons (again, decidedly different from TR), being like, ~\"Hey, I'm being the second vote here, yes that's right, I'm jumping on a wagon, and x reason is why.\"~  Basically, doing the exact opposite of what scum will generally try to do on day one, which is stay out of the spotlight.  As the narrative moves on, I find it VERY unlikely that she is the type of scum who would be encouraging herself or be encouraged by others to bring the spotlight on herself.<br>\n<br>\nShe cooled down a lot since gaining town cred.  That sounds suspicious when worded that way, but I think that would be a very strange strategy for a scum to take on.  &#8220;Hey, I'll just light a bunch of fires and instigate a bunch of shit, and the second people start pointing fingers at me, I'll just not defend myself and let everyone sully my name uncontested.&#8221;  It's usually the exact other way around: make yourself sparse until people start to notice how sparse you are and then defend yourself.  I just can't see how getting yourself implicated in a bunch of shit and then disappearing just when it's time to make sense of it fits into a scum strategy.  It seems odd to give town cred for it, but I'd say it's null inactivity.<br>\n<br>\nThen, she explodes back on the scene and makes a bunch of silly mistakes.  The amount of slip-ups she's making and the amount of dead paths she's sniffed down in all of her many words of posts makes me think that she wouldn't be trusted by the mafia to go so balls to the wall in making accusations.  Being on a mafia team means that you are not on an island: you have several people coaching you, and Naomi doesn't at all feel coached.  I suppose the counterargument would be that she went balls to the wall early, got reprimanded, disappeared off the face of the earth, then when the heat got turned up too much to go unignored (not buying this given she didn't come until several pages after the heat came on, yet she came before votes built up, so I have no idea what the boiling point was for her to explode back on the scene; just seems like null randomness), and then came back on the scene defending herself.  I don't buy this counterargument for a lot of reasons though (too long a lag between her going balls to the wall and how long it would take for her to be reprimanded [over a week real time], the timing of her reappearance as already covered, the fact that her explosion back on the scene does not seem coached or prepared at all in spite of how much time had gone for it to be prepared).  I really really really think all signs point to a flailing townie.<br>\n<br>\nVoting pattern doesn't fit a scum well (see post 815).  The only one of the three big bandwagons she jumped on was mine.<br>\n<br>\nEffulgence was her biggest fan of the regular posters toward the end of Day 1 with pressure mounting against her to be lynched on Day 2.  It would be a very ballsy level to shoot your biggest and most trusted defendant when you are probably the favorite to be lynched going into Day 2.  I can't see why the mafia would shoot Good Morning given there were zero special tells and that it's a fresh player who hasn't shown much either way, so with how many likely villagers there are (eg: Effulgence) I would feel near certain they would take their chances with him.

He could spend much of the first part of the day just defending himself against a silly accusation of ~\"Omg, you didn't ask the quesiton I expected you to.\"~  His post count shot up without saying much more than, \"So what? Big whoop?\"<br>\n<br>\nAs such, my early notes are that he could just be feasting on the easy fodder, just defending himself against silly accusations, and as such doesn't need to associate himself with anyone.  When asked to move past the tunnel of Nul, he said that Naomi is <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">&#8220;Nullish-Town. Probably haven't looked that much at her - but from what I've been reading, it seems like town intent.&#8221;</div>  Very non-committal, and goes along with what the rest of the town thinks at the time and, of course, says that he hasn't much looked into it.  None of this is suspicious, it's just either null-town, or a very convenient line for a scum to take to not garner suspicion.<br>\n<br>\nThe fact that he went cold once he stopped having the easy fodder posts corroborates this potential narrative.  In post 532 (that's with a 5, people) he's still talking about the Nul/CD bussing theory as if that's still the only salient thing that's happened so far in the game.<br>\n<br>\nI have no problem finding scum pairings for him.  Anyone who has listed scum reads has done so in a very conflicted manner (sometimes literally split on the issue, in the case of hydras, but often just in an \"eh, I could see it, but it's how he always is\" sorta way).<br>\n<br>\nFits into the voting narrative okay.  He's in the middle of the wagon on PoPP, and didn't vote on either of the other big wagons.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Morph the Cat</div> &#8211; My general impression when reading through was that he stayed out of the fray quite well and followed a good scum's line very well.<br>\n<br>\nHe's managed to be not even remotely associated with anyone that the town is reasonably suspicious of.  Seriously, the only person who's so much as quote his posts, it seems, is serrapaladin, who is a strong-ish townread (imo) who was suspicious of Morph/NEC.  He's managed to be so far out of the portrait without being included in just about anyone's inactive list at just about any point.  I mean, just because someone isn't suspicious doesn't mean that they are suspicious--that would be a ridiculous argument&#8212;but I can see this as a very good mafia's ideal game.<br>\n<br>\nLooking back through the ISO, I can kinda see how he achieves this.  His posts that aren't just friendly what-have-yous seem to often be stepping in on feuds and placating them with little blurbs that keep their distance (eg: [*post]66[/post], [*post]87[/post], [*post]90[/post], [*post]110[/post], [*post]126[/post], it goes on).  He's commenting on the dispute (which is the main ordeal at hand at the time), yet if you were to interview anyone afterward, I would hardly expect that anyone would list NEC as a central character in the thread, or even a big outside influence.  They would just remember that he was there and he made some comments of some sort.  Kinda float like a butterfly, sting like a bee-ish.<br>\n<br>\nThen the thread becomes a headache to read and he just kinda starts playing the town's administrative assistant: following up on people who said they had more to say, asking some questions, +1'ing the fact that gender pronouns don't matter. That goes on for ~200 posts (most of the game at that point), and then he comes back with some contributions to logic and even a vote for pitoli (now serrapaladin).  When he starts to seem the most townish is with [*post]464[/post], as it is literally a bold statement to make at that point of the game.  This would have gained massive town cred with me.....if it had come BEFORE serrapaladin started to make the case.  As it stands, serrapaladin was quickly becoming a reputable person to side with (ie, not risky to jump on even though other reputable people felt strongly against her), and Naomi's iso would clearly show to NEC that there's an opportunity afoot to thoroughly sully someone.<br>\n<br>\nHe was early to the show and did stick out as much as he'd ever let himself show with the Naomi push, but given how big Naomi's warts were, if this is the most townish thing I can say for NEC, then I'm really not likin' NEC.<br>\n<br>\nThen a new hydra partner replaces-in, and he continues to be an overall nice lad to talk to and is willing to help you out on some terminology here and there if you'd like.<br>\n<br>\nFinally, we get some associations via a list of every town member.  The thing that sticks out is that other than PoPP and TR, everyone he's suspicious of comes with a hydra dissonance.  I've never played with hydras, so let this come with a grain of salt, but I think these would be easy to backpedal on, and I've already seen hydras convince &#8220;themselves&#8221; on a player or two without it drawing suspicion.  The fact that these avenues exist for backing out of suspicions, several permutations of scum teams seem very reasonable to me: morph/CD, morph/MS, morph/implosion, etc.  Morph/TR would have to be very ballsy because he scummed him just as the heat was coming off TR (and before it came back on in full force).<br>\n<br>\nThe voting narrative doesn't fit as neatly as the others.  It could be reasonably expected, though, that there would be at least one scum who isn't a bandwagon-hopping fiend.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Shamrock</div> &#8211; It's been pointed out at length that Metal Sonic was full of fluff, and it's been pointed out that he's done it to a degree to where it's such first-level scumming that we could reasonably expect better from most mafia, so I'll skip the notes I have on him that get into all that.  The things is that I kinda got the sense that he's banking on his meta to save him, and may even be parodying himself a bit.  He's outright antagonizing and self-deprecating in his way of being lazy villager, especially all over page 15.  [*post]354[/post]: Metal Sonic is just like at Stephen Colbert-level oblivious self-irony: ~&#8220;He only digs up reads when asked, which is why I'm going to bandwagon someone that you told me to look into.&#8221;~  He had several similar posts with self-effacing irony in them that he at least pretended to be oblivious to.  I've sometimes had daydreams of being a lazy villager so that one day I could get that sweet sweet vindicating PM that says I am mafia, and just spend the whole game being like &#8220;Fuck you guys, I always play like this.  Deal with it,&#8221; and Sonic seems like he might be taking it to that extreme.<br>\n<br>\nBut maybe his town games are this cocky as well, and even if they aren't, this is a weak read.  I'm just not totally buying the &#8220;surely no scum would be this stupid&#8221; argument because Sonic might think it's playing into his image.<br>\n<br>\nThen, Shamrock comes in and my pathos totally splits with my logos.  I think Shamrock is nothing but good vibes.  Articulate, making thorough posts when neither asked nor expected to&#8212;overall, plays in a way I appreciate a lot.  I could, however, see how it could fit into a scum strategy.  He had a lot to make up for taking over for the Village Idiot who had taken some heat.  Shamrock even makes a meta-excuse before making his big replacement catch-up post (going as far as to say his post goes against his religion and that he should self-flagellate; not that I'm oblivious to the exaggeration and humor, I'm just saying there's no room to doubt the meta-excusing that's going on), so clearly he's going to an inordinate level of trouble to clean his image.  Not that trying to make a village not hate you is alignment-dependent; getting lynched sounds like an unpleasant thing for townie and mafia alike, but again, it's actions that are in line with mafia, so I'm leaving him in the Could Go either Way Bin.<br>\n<br>\nMy viscera continues to like his line of questioning on page 32, and he's a bit more aggressive with posters than mafia generally like to be on Day 1.  Then again, given that he's mostly doing it with now-confirmed villagers who had fallen into malhumor with the town at a time when the lynch was already decided, it seems reasonable that scum could ride this wave as well.  It all sends out good vibes because there's no cognitive dissonance: his town perspective (&#8220;well that looks scummy&#8221;) and his scum perspective (&#8220;I can implicate a townie at a time where I'm basically freerolling&#8221;) are perfectly aligned.<br>\n<br>\nSo I have no intention of bolding his name anytime soon, but I'm not going to lose credence over pairings that involve him, and as the process of elimination narrows, he might become a good option in mid-to-late game.<br>\n<br>\nI think there are plenty of pairings that make sense for him.  Just about all of my suspects have been giving him the old &#8220;no reads either way&#8221; on him or have been ignoring him altogether.  His voting narrative fits perfectly (though, honestly, just about anyone could have clinched PoPP's fate).<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Implosion</div> &#8211; Once he gets into game specific posts (especially [*post]112[/post] on), there's a lot I like that gave him some early town cred.  I think he made a lot of legitimate attacks on Team Rocket which led me to give him a ton of town cred early on.  He's also one of the only players who doesn't think a big fuss needs to be made about the early Nul/CD shit fling, which made me feel like I wasn't the only not taking crazy pills.  So I was all about implosion early on.<br>\n<br>\nHowever, my general impression reads don't fare quite as well.  He talks a lot about the game in general terms, especially early on.  This is very safe territory for scum because you can photocopy posts like this in every game you play in, regardless of alignment, and look like you're contributing.  ~&#8221;Sure let's get in a semantics argument about the phrase 'in this town'; let me reply to you with an exaggeratedly literal interpretations of your question.&#8221;~  He even admits to (not really the right word because it's not incriminating, per se) that he's basically photocopying his argument on how association tells are useless.  It's a whole lot of saying things that you can't really argue are wrong, but then again aren't salient to the game at hand.<br>\n<br>\nHe has 16 of the first 100 posts (almost tripling his expected share, for those counting at home), and all but a clause here and a clause there is stuff that could be said by anyone in any game.  First 100 posts though, so fair enough, but he seemed to be at his most active when there was easy fodder.  Not just talking about first 100 posts, either; also [*post]144[/post], [*post]178[/post], [*post]210[/post], [*post]273[/post], [*post]309[/post] (boasting, then semantics, then self-reference), I don't know it gets exhausting to list all the examples of helping people with html code and talking about playstyles and general game theory and all that.  The point isn't that any of it is suspicious, just that it's a great way for scum and townies alike to gain cred-through-wordcount without taking any real risks.  As the day progresses, talk about general play slows and he disappears off the face of the earth.  This could very well be that the cavalry showed up in the form of Effulgence, so now he can go off to bigger and better things, but it's also a convenient line for scum to take. <br>\n<br>\nMore importantly, among the posts that I really liked, there were just enough things that I disagreed strongly on to keep me concerned.  Just as examples (I'm not actually in the mood for arguing these points as it would be irrelevant to the issue at hand) his large post on association tells is a misuse of probability principles, I disagreed strongly with thinking that early role calls for inactives is scummy (though this might be playstyle difference because I come from games where Day 1 is ~3 pages), got a little frustrated that he couldn't see how Naomi defending townies is only beknighting for those who know that she is defending a townie (even though we're both on the same page that it doesn't make Naomi a scum), etc.  I realize that some of this is weakened due to their association with emotion, it just seems to strike that perfect balance of &#8220;that makes perfect sense&#8221; with &#8220;that is THIS close to being right, but there's a dangerous fallacy that leads to the completely wrong answer.&#8221;  This makes me concerned that he's reasonable enough and posting enough to gain trust, and through reasonable twists of logic is able to opportunely guide the village down the wrong paths.<br>\n<br>\nThen, of course, this hypothesis fits nicely into the voting narrative.  I'd imagine if he's the type who's strategy is to go hard on arguments that don't give him cognitive dissonance, then it makes sense he would be leading the charge against townies who he thought he could reasonably represent as suspicious (instead of backseating).  He was early to the wagon for me (going after Reecer from a very early stage) and was middle-to-earlyish to the post-BestWillCui PoPP wagon.  He was, however, strongly against Nul being a baddie.<br>\n<br>\nAll this probably adds up to a mostly null read.  He is my 4th most likely candidate, though (and I'm not whizzing my panties over the 3rd candidate), so I'm keeping fairly suspicious of my null-to-ever-so-slightly scum reads.<br>\n<br>\nTR and implosion make a poor pairing, by the way.  He's really the first to call out TR on some things that are making him the current lynch candidate, yet by day's end, he had defended him so much (without any vote pressure being applied) that it's a terrible way to dissociate from TR.  Basically, implosion has gone after TR at the times when he could least leverage the advantage of doing so (very early Day 1, starting the wagon after everyone else had already said they like the lynch) and defended TR at the times when he could least leverage the advantage of the defense (when there's no chance he's going to get lynched anyway).  Basically, implosion's drawing a huge association between the two and accepting none of the advantages of doing so.  This would obviously be a bad and presumptive reason to keep implosion off my PoE list, though, so here he is.", "time": "Wed Jul 24, 2013 12:37 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=29652&start=825", "forum": "53", "thread": "29652"}

There's no real presence there to me - their posts read as having no real push or energy to them.  <br>\n<br>\nTheir lack of engagement in discussion whether Pecan was town or scum bugs me - in fact, there's an awful lack of Pecan discussion in their ISO despite him being a hot topic.

The Naomi analysis ended in a middle-of-the-road 'continuum' conclusion.  The goodmorning meta-analysis stayed pretty descriptive and neutral - if it had been \"I need more information to be sure but I think goodmorning is playing to her town/scum meta\" I may have been ok with it but that didn't happen.

{"number": 872, "id": "5156648", "user": "surviva316", "user_id": "22006", "content": "<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Well, I started to think more town on implosion because:</div><br>\n<br>\nI started to think about how so many of his reads are a discussion of what seems genuine to him because, at first, I thought it made it more plausible that he'd be scum.  After all, using unfalsifiable arguments is a great tactic for scum because, obviously, their arguments can't be falsified, which makes it very easy to stay low key even when your reads are questioned.  (You can see this in the interaction toward the end of Day 1 where an argument about whether or not implosion still thought TR was genuine didn't become a shit flinging contest of my facts against yours, your logic is stupid, no your logic is stupid and so on; it was just kinda like, &#8220;You changed your mind yet?&#8221;)<br>\n<br>\nBut while in isolation it could be a scum tactic, it doesn't fit into my scum narrative for implosion, where he's leading the charge for the village with sensible arguments that run us over a cliff.  Under this scum narrative, implosion wouldn't be wary of making strong, assertive, factual statements (like he made throughout the beginning of the game that mostly pleased, but sometimes irked me).  It makes sense for the coasting type of scum, but saying, &#8220;This is my sense of it, use that for what it's worth,&#8221; goes against the strategy of someone trying to bring demise through strong leadership.<br>\n<br>\nYadda yadda yadda, the more I think about it, the more I think that implosion is probably just a guy who's doing whatever he can to help the village (whether that's through emotional tells, logic, general theory, html how-to, whatever), and that he just happened to annoy me a couple of times with a couple of understandable mistakes.  Besides, the three I highlighted in the other post (I thought there were some others, but those are the only ones I can think of) don't lead the village down dark alleys: the thing he said about association tells, though potentially pernicious, is independent of alignment because he's basically photocopied it from other games; the one about scum going after inactives early on Day 1 I'm just going to completely chalk up to different backgrounds (I'm used to games whose entire lifespan is slightly longer than just Day 1 is here, lol); and assuming that I'm right about Naomi being a townie, implosion not getting the white-knighting argument doesn't lead the village to a crucial wrong answer.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">But then:</div><br>\n<br>\nSomething else that really rubbed me the wrong way was kind of the excused absence once Effulgence showed up.  It's not that the alibi isn't believable, I just don't like people scooping up a boatload of town credit (to the point that almost everyone had him as a top town read) and then stealing off into obscurity no questions asked.  This is also when more of the sense and feel type of reads started to come from him, too, so it could fit into a narrative where he's assertive in the beginning until he locks down a townread and then skates.  I guess this is similar to the theory some have on Naomi, except Naomi was so bad at it that it seems crazy that anyone would think that was a good idea, whereas implosion handled every step of it much more beautifully (the plausible assertiveness, the alibi for changing gears and the coasting).  I guess I just see starting fires and disappearing into thin air as different from doing what you need to do to build sustainable towncred and then finding any excuse to step back.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nI structured the post this way (with the two different sections) because after trying and failing to come up with a conclusion, this is the best way to sum up where I'm at right now.  When I think of the slightly-off arguments thing, I start to think that it's probably just in my head and that I should let it go, but when I think of the stepping back once the cavalry came in thing, then I can't let it go and think that there might really be something there.", "time": "Thu Jul 25, 2013 4:11 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=29652&start=850", "forum": "53", "thread": "29652"}

It would certainly very easily hold up in the court of law.  That doesn't mean that it's potential for scum doesn't affect the likelihood that you could be scum.  Trying to explain that divulged myself into writing notes for a massive post that's mostly about general theory and mostly about a soft argument on a player that I don't think people have interest (nor necessarily should have that much interest) reading a ton about today, so to try to reply to you without derailing potentially better discussion.  It's not satisfactory, but feel free to ask more because I love talking game theory.<br>\n<br>\nCliffnote 1: Instead of doing townreads/scumreads, I tend to moreso look at an entire narrative and punish any lines that a scum person could take advantage of.  The ideal of this strategy is to try to mitigate any advantages that scum could gain on the town to the point that their optimal strategy is perfectly balanced/unexploitable, which is a mere zero-sum gain.  This level of perfection isn't realistic, but a perfectly unexploitable strategy for scum is basically just to play as any other helpful villager, even to the extent of not favoring their scum partners in anyway.  Obviously this ideal, or any shadow of it, is a huge advantage for the village.<br>\n<br>\nWhat's cliffnoted out of here is examples of how the scum's statistical advantages get assuaged by forcing them to vote in more balanced ways, produce more balanced scum lists, etc.  These are simple, basic examples, but making sure people don't get away with other exploitative lines as scum is just a simple extrapolation from that.<br>\n<br>\nCliffnote 2: A big diversion on how I noticed that \"policy lynches\" get a bad name around here, when that's probably because people generally take this strategy to be \"lynch a random one of the three inactives,\" which is terrible.  There are good ways to mitigate the advantage scum get when there are inactive players.  This part is truly, truly irrelevant, but ask away.<br>\n<br>\nCliffnote 3: An explanation of how these reads/narratives/whatever you want to call them will (assuming good analysis) just about always coincide with an improved chance that that player is scum.  A bastardized version of explaining this is, I guess, to say that any good line for scum to take is going to be a reasonably standard line for any good scum to take (so long as it isn't a non-thinking player, a weird line, a very bold or risky move, etc; this should be considered in the \"good analysis\" that we assumed), whereas anything that stands out to an observer and remains suspicious after good analysis is going to be at least a bit non-standard (eg: even if it's understandable, it's not like it's standard that townies just clock out once another good townie replaces-in...though I am new to replace-in games).<br>\n<br>\nThen I get into how this ratio (of scum likelihood:town likeihood) can be further weighted based on how frequent suspicious activity/scumreads/etc are in a given town.  In theory, this is actually a quotient that literally weights that number, but in simple terms, it's kinda Occam's Razor.  If this were a town where so many people were suspicious, then the simplest explanations with the least unlikely caveats would rise to the top.  In a town where we're cobbling together scum possibilities, more elaborate schemes of crafty scumming necessarily become more valuable.  I think this is more of the latter town, so anything that makes me say, \"I could see scum doing that\" is rising to the top.", "time": "Thu Jul 25, 2013 5:07 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=29652&start=900", "forum": "53", "thread": "29652"}

Instead of you immediately explaining your lack of stuff, you were slightly too quick to bring up our last game.

Was more poised than here. Since then she's only been town, where her play is looser. I want to say this fits her town-meta more, but wouldn't put any money on it, as she only has 1 completed scumgame and it was her first game onsite at that.<br>\n<br>\nImplosion: only has 1 recent scum game, which was pretty average. Read him as pretty obvtown in his recent towngames. Would be very surprised if scum.<br>\n<br>\nYates: nominated for manipulation scummy. His play here is almost too boring to correspond with his usual scum-meta, he might just be chilling because people are townreading him and he's busy elsewhere.<br>\n<br>\nCheery: read several games, he's the same in all of them. not worth metaing.<br>\n<br>\nNaomi: her play does correspond more to her scum-meta, but I suppose that is just too long ago to be accurate. (I agree with eff's assessment that town PPP means town Naomi.)<br>\n<br>\nMS: too scummy to be scum in most of his town games. Slightly more tryhard in the one scum-game I've read.

I didn't post anything on him yet, so here are my reads broken up by day.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Notes from yesterday:</div> Replaced an inactive with lots of activity.  It's not just the activity that makes him a villager, though.  It's the fact that he's leading the charge on people that no one suspected before, and he's doing it in a way that's not just spraying and trying to get any bandwagon started that he can.  He explicitly didn't like either of the bandwagons that had started (both of which are confirmed villagers from my perspective), and his Would Like to Lynch List was just two people.  One of those players, Naomi-Tan, was at the top of a lot of likely villagers lists and was yet to get any heat.  Even though I feel pretty strongly that Naomi is town, I still don't think trying to build a charge against her with no previous support is a very scum thing to do at all, especially at a point of the game where there were two bandwagons to choose from and a scum very easily could have just said, &#8220;Well, I don't think so-and-so is a villager, and I think that the other guy who has a bandwagon on him is as per Post #{some post written by someone else} I think the other guy is, so I'll go with that one.&#8221;  I'm exaggerating a bit, but I still think that serrapaladin's actions given the timing of it is SO much more in line with a villager than it is with a scum...even a very good, very confident one.  (For the sake of a counterexample, I've gone back over Shamrock's replace-in posts that I originally felt pretty good about and would say it's much much easier fodder for scum; give a couple of strong town reads and then backseat a liked townie's case against a now-confirmed townie [ie: piggybacking Eff's argument against PPP]).   Serra also did some investigation on Morph the Cat (then Effen), whom no one had seriously looked into yet.<br>\n<br>\nAttacking untouched players is sure to get a lot of questions aimed your way and can only convince anyone after typing out several posts worth of reasoning and clarification, which is putting himself in the spotlight far more than any mafia member would naturally like to.  Obviously, a very good scum might attempt it, but it's beneficial for the town to force scum to play this way, so I'm fine with giving out brownie points for it; besides, the \"he might be good scum\" line is only useful in late game after all of the player's bandwagons flip town and we have any actual hard reasoning to question their motives).<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Notes from today:</div> He started today by misdirecting attention from the easy target and trying to get discussion going on one of Cheery Dog/Yates/Morph.  Mentioning Yates marks the 3rd time that he mentioned someone that no one had seriously considered as scum.  Again, bucking the easy lynch to push for unpopular lynches is extremely villagery.  Also, the motivation of pressuring potential tough scum instead of just making a day out of it is completely counterproductive as a wolf.  It's not impossible, but again, rewarding players for doing things that are counterproductive to wolves makes the town tougher to exploit.<br>\n<br>\nHis latest paradox on whether or not he had a scum read on Cheery Dog is tough to follow, but it more-so follows his narrative that he's trying to pressure players who would be tough wolves instead of making an easy day of it (which is an extremely town motivation) than it follows any sort of scum narrative.  (I started to type out all my thoughts on each permutation of serra scum/CD town, serra scum/CD scum, serra town/CD town and serra town/CD scum and demonstrate on an event-by-event basis how serra town makes more sense regardless, but it got long, so hopefully my point's evident; feel free to ask for elaboration).<br>\n<br>\nOf course, if TR flips scum, then all of this could be seen as a ploy to divert attention, and in that case we can analyze 912 and 971 to death (still tend to think it's town), but if serra's scuminess is contingent on TR's scuminess, then TR is <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">necessarily</div> at least as likely to be scum and, thus, should <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">necessarily</div> be lynched before serra.

The player list has several players I think of as likely leaders, and she's right in there pushing her own reads and strategy, calling down randomly forming wagons when she has strong scum suspects who aren't getting votes.  She doesn't post cases or walls of analysis.  She picks up individual posts as they happen and cals out what's objectionable or suspicios about them.  It's a very \"in the moment\" style of scumhunting.<br>\n<br>\nTown game (Mini 1435) - <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=23&amp;t=26544\" class=\"postlink\">http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=23&amp;t=26544</a><br>\n<br>\nIn this game she comes off as more irritable and frustrated by other players.  My impression of this player list is that it's less high-powered than the first one, and right from the start she's assertive.  I can see some parallels with this game because it started with a lot of theory and strategy talk being generated from the votes, lines of questioning and stances that people took. A similar dynamic took place in the Jimmy Newtron game starting around post <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4803702#p4803702\" class=\"postlink\">60</a> after somene suggested another player be copped.  In Post <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4805592#p4805592\" class=\"postlink\">156</a> she pushes back when pressured.  This is a strong, assertive pushback, and the argument goes on for several more posts.  As the game progresses, frustration is evident, possibly at its height in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4909079#p4909079\" class=\"postlink\">this section</a> of the thread.  She took a dayvig shot and hit the scum godmother.  Overall, strong scumhunting, strong stances, short and to the point posts, more of the \"in the moment style\" and a fair bit of irritability showing in her posts.<br>\n<br>\nNewbie scum game - <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4680781#p4680781\" class=\"postlink\">http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.ph ... 1#p4680781</a><br>\n<br>\nShe replaced into this game, and although there are some similarities in style - short posts and focus on individiual posts more than on progressions, it's less in the moment.  That could be initially due to replacing in.  She's less confrontational, which is probably the biggest difference.  In the earlier games, especially 1435, she keeps at people, encourages people to vote with her, and shows a lot of concern about how the bandwagons form.  In this game, she's content for things to just develop.  She was under no real pressure and seems to let town drive bad bandwagons.  <br>\n<br>\n<br>\nSo, how does all that relate to this game?  Reading back through the TR iso and focusing on the Elyse posts, I'm seeing the assertive style, though it feels a little less in the moment.  Maybe due to V/LA issues.  <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5121311#p5121311\">491</a> stands out as a strong town-Elyse looking post content-wise, but it also catches my eye because it is a long post compared to the three games above.  Catch-up post?  <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5154894#p5154894\">846</a> really struck me in my first read-through due to the resignation and not-gonna-fight-this feel.  I'm having a hard time imagining this as typical of Elyse in any alignment. :/.  Not many Elyse posts after that one and she's currently on V/LA.  This game looks a lot more like her town game than the one scum game I found.  I don't know if her signature is up to date, but it indicates she's only played one scum game here.<br>\n<br>\n----------<br>\n<br>\nSerra, why did you ask me to meta Elyse specifically?

He's seriously only commenting on things that are two inches from his face.  There's no delving into the thread.  There's no avidity to wrangle the mafia out of the shadows.  It's like, ~\"You said something about me, so now I suppose I'll respond by turning into a point of how it proves one of 3 very first level points: either it proves I'm town, proves you're town or proves your scum.\"~  And most the posts that aren't in response to something said to him are just him seeing a chance to make someone look bad and doing it.  People have started detecting opportunism in serra's game, but I think CD's game is much more textbook opportunism.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Shamrock</div><br>\nIf we lynch TR and he turns town, then it sure will have been a scummy day for Shamrock.  If TR isn't today's lynch, then all of this will kinda just be a question mark; if he's lynched and flips scum, then I would consider it a medium townread on Shamrock (everything I get in from here-on would be null and his line against TR would be non-standard [though not impossible] as scum).<br>\n<br>\nAs stated before, his slot seemed very plausibly scummy when he replaced in, and then I liked his replace-in posts though it didn't do anything to completely disspell possibility of scum.  Well, now looking back on it, it really does seem exactly like the type of post scum could make (not scum read in and of itself, but it fits into the narrative), and then today when the innocent child called TR a sure-thing to be lynched, Shamrock did what only scum would do when hearing that a townie was going to be a snap lynch: gloat.  A townie would naturally feel unease at the idea of an easy lynching day (and react more like serra did at the beginning of D2); scum has all the reason in the world to pile on the negative aura surrounding TR and to feel pleased about how the day was going.  Then, when the day hit its lull, he spent much of his time shooting down counterwagons, encouraging us to end the day early, questioning Morph for undoing the L-1 (even the Morph had very recently said that he was posting soon with reads), etc.<br>\n<br>\nAll of his other posts are just kinda sprayin discredits that come off a bit insincere.  He questions serra for calling TR a must lynch, even though not too much later he's shooting down counterwagons and seeking out the hammer on TR.  He spends some posts discrediting Yates (calling out his inactivity, calling his post fake as plastic shit, lines him up as the next lynch), which I'm all for as you can tell by the fact that I +1'ed serra's post on lynching CD/Morph/Yates and the fact that I voted Yates soon after, but unlike serra (and me), he VERY shortly thereafter shoots down attempts to start a counterwagon on Yates.  He discredits me, trying to make it sound as though I'm all talk and no action, and then doesn't follow up on the criticism when I list all of the actions I have taken.  All of this heavily plays into the narrative of someone trying to make sure he doesn't mess up the easy lynch he has right in front of him, but wants to stay active by making sure as many potential lynches are lined up for the next day as possible.  Basically, this strategy is very conducive to making sure it's a productive day for the mafia (by spreading suspicion around and still getting their lynch), while ensuring it's an unproductive day for the village.<br>\n<br>\nKinda wanted to save this for iffen TR gets lynched and flips town since it all goes out the window otherwise, but meh, you asked for content and there's nothing in here that would make it strategically advantageous to withhold (other than saving you all the torture of reading it), so here it is.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Morph the Cat</div><br>\n<br>\nThe content that was posted is very hold-overy, so my balls are beginning to suffer slightly of cyanosis waiting for the full follow-through.

It's not that it's not plausible or that I don't \"sympathize\"; it's that I can't let scum get away with posting no more than \"I don't feel like it\" because it's super advantageous for scum to have that up their sleeve.  Yates has since posted a good deal of content, which seriously alleviates that bother, but it doesn't go away completely because it still holds that he got away with a couple weeks of not posting simply because he's lazy.  I continue to feel that it's been a long time since implosion's given me any reason to think he's town.  Still no more than a PoE suspect, but pick it up, damnit.<br>\n<br>\nBut anyway, I do kinda follow his logic on the relational tells thing more than others did (I think they're losing the forest from the trees), but the fact that he's not wrong or ended up making a decent point is less important than the way he did it, which I think could fit a scum narrative.  He made a point that Shamrock was going after the lynch favorite without using any of the reads that had developed since the end of Day 1.  Shamrock asked if there he had any relational tells (to deflect the accusation that he was going with the easy answer without reasoning), and Yates eventually got around to saying yes (which was the WIFOM post).  Now, how he got to saying yes is important.  I think where it probably turned for people from a questioning of \"Why are you not using relational tells bro?\" into an accusation of not having the SAME relational tells is [*post]997[/post].  It's not relevant to his original point that Shamrock missed an \"easy one,\" but I think people took this as a claim that Shamrock is scummy for missing it (though it's really just citing an example of a tell he got because he was pressed to give an example in order to deflect from the fact that Shamrock didn't seem interested in finding one)  It's the tone there of, ~\"Here's an obvious one, how could you be so stupid?\"~, which could just as well be Yates being uncouth, or it could be that he was trying to exaggerate all of his points as much as possible to make Shamrock seem as bad as possible, which is a scummy thing to do.<br>\n<br>\nI like what's come out of the pressure placed on Yates, his bandwagon has since doubled (!!), so the vote will stay.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Naomi</div><br>\n<br>\nI still think you're town, but damnit, post more and be of some kind of use.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">TR</div><br>\n<br>\nI don't think the \"slow and easy\" build of the lynch wagon is that exonerating.

If someone were to swoop in right now and say \"Let's lynch Morph!\" right now, I wouldn't think of it as being nearly as town.  Even though they would be starting a wagon, it's not like it'd be the first time that Morph and scum would be mentioned in the same sentence today.  It's the fact that serra made a case against Naomi when NO ONE had even vaguely considered that possibility and made a sensible case against her (though it's one I disagree with, I certainly don't think it's forced or totally ridiculous) and then proceeded to do the same with Morph very early in his posting and then was the first to seriously mention Yates that comes off as exclusively villager to me.<br>\n<br>\nWhen I say that this means that someone will have to defend themselves a lot and face a lot of questions, I don't so much mean that this would make scum have to make long posts and provide more word count than they would like to (though that's part of it), but I really mean that it just creates a natural air of skepticism and doubt around a player's posts.  They have to say a lot AND what they're saying is naturally gonna come with a vibe of, \"I'm not feelin' what this guy's saying.\"  It's just an unnecessary risk for scum to take, and anyone who isn't very good at being scum shouldn't take on that risk, and thus, I have no problem giving someone villager cred for it (again, I like to give villager credit for anything that's bad for scum).<br>\n<br>\nSo long story short, it's not the word count or the starting bandwagons that makes it villagery.  It's doing anything that goes against the general zeitgeist of the town at that time.  It's anything that ruffles feathers and makes people naturally want to hate that person.<br>\n<br>\nAs you imply (and as I alluded to when I said it would require master scum to pull it off), it could just be the work of good scum.  I hate to use this excuse for pursuing people early though when we don't have much tangible evidence to go on.  If someone's playing an unexploitable scum game by acting completely face-up villager, then we should assume villager until more tangible tells can show a narrative of good scum that's leading the village in the wrong direction.  If every read that serra has shows up bad as the game moves on, as night kills prove advantageous for a wolf team that includes him, as relational tells point in his direction, then we can build a case that would outweigh this stuff I'm talking about because it might just be the work of a mastermind scum.  This, btw, is why I have no interest in a implosion wagon even if I don't get the best vibe from his playstyle so far.<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5189502#p5189502\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5189502#p5189502\" data-post-id=\"5189502\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 1038</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=19287\">Cheery Dog</a> wrote:</cite>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5152961#p5152961\">Start of the day</a><br>\nScum reading Rocket - who is the \"easy lynch\".

If Naomi were to choose to do x earlier in the game (for example), then I follow that branch of the event tree down and analyze his future actions in light of that.  So when people say, \"Naomi is coasting on her town cred, which is something scum would do,\" then I would point out that though this might make sense in a vacuum, it doesn't make sense that someone who plans to coast on town cred would start a game by lighting a bunch of fires with bad logic.  Someone could counter by pointing out that she might just be doing whatever's working for her at the time and argue how each of those things work for that player at that time in the game, and that argument might be legitimate, but now at least we've moved past talking about mere \"scumreads\" and \"townreads\" in a vacuum and looking at someone's entire line throughout the game and asking if it makes sense for how scum would play a game.  I don't want to delve too much into that example because I'm getting a bit beside the point, but basically I'm saying that I don't just look at \"scumreads\" and \"townreads,\" but moreso look at if someone's game from beginning to end is something that I could see scum using as a strategy to win the game for their team.

My point is that, assume that serra is scum, then by the time you get to lylo (or close to it), several townies will have been lynched (likely some of which would have been ideated by serra himself), likely at least one scum will have been found, and there will have been several night kills.  This provides a lot of tangible evidence to sort through that could--through rereading serra's town/scum reads and seeing how legitimate each seems or how wishy washy each seems, through relational tells with the confirmed scum, through NKA, etc--potentially create a strong enough case to point at serra.  As of right now, Occam's Razor favors the explanation that serra is a villager who's acting like a villager over him being a super villain mastermind, but by the time we get to the end game, narratives will have gotten more complicated and the simplest explanation left should hopefully be that he's scum.<br>\n<br>\nI don't want to get too much into this for obvious reasons, but under this assumption that serra's scum, I disagree that there are too many confirmed town players for us to get anything out of NKA by, let's say, Day 4 or so.<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5192609#p5192609\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5192609#p5192609\" data-post-id=\"5192609\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 1047</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=19287\">Cheery Dog</a> wrote:</cite>\nI work with what I can work with, which gives me what is my playstyle, I know it generally works for me except for when people to decide that the playstyle itself makes me scum instead of actual game content with the motivations for why I wouldn't have been doing whatever as scum or whatever.

Three power roles tend to be most common in this scenario, however there are several setups that go against this trend.  History isn't necessarily going to provide all the answers, because as far as I can see Innocent Child and Serial Killer have (perhaps appropriately?) not met before.  However, some observations which may be of note:<br>\n<br>\n- Jack of all Trades and Jailkeeper have never been combined in a Mini Normal as far as I can see.  Same with the Innocent Child (though both Innocent Child and Jack of all Trades seem to be less frequently used roles here).  <br>\n- Commuter has only appeared in about six Mini Normal games total.  Of these, only one featured a Serial Killer.  However, the moderator of this game was in that game.<br>\n- Odd-Night Doctor is also quite rare - about three instances total including a Mafia Odd-Night Doctor.  There are quite a few instances of Odd-Night roles being twinned with Even-Night roles, but plenty of games just have an Odd-Night role (if there is one at all).  <br>\n- Jailkeeper and Serial Killer have appeared together a few times.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">The question to you (and others) is this - are we in 2-1-10 or 3-1-9?</div>", "time": "Wed Aug 14, 2013 12:27 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=29652&start=1150", "forum": "53", "thread": "29652"}

But it also seems unlikely that Kalimar, serra, and I are the only PRs, especially when you consider that my ability really isn't very useful on its own - in this hypothetical setup there aren't any super-strong PRs for me to blow a N1 emergency protection on, but there also is almost no chance of me earning the town an extra mislynch as I'd have to protect correctly on both nights 1 and 3, which is silly to expect.  And considering this setup is multiball, a protected target isn't confirmed as town, so it's not even useful in that way.<br>\n<br>\nI think x-shot commuter is far more plausible as the missing PR than jailkeeper.  JK is a really strong role, especially given that one of our PRs doesn't even have a night action to block.

I can certainly read it as a secondary killer because it does sound like someone who's concerned with hearing the final thoughts from someone they thought would die that night.  I don't know why a Vanilla Townie (or commuter townie) would be so concerned with getting final D1 thoughts from someone when there was no chance to reverse the lynch train at that point (PPP was waiting to be hammered) and when there was no reason to believe that she wouldn't be around on D2 to offer thoughts.  That being said I don't know if it quite makes sense as a serial killer, either.<br>\n<br>\nI could totally see it as town vig, trying to squeeze out some final information to make the most informed kill that night, and if they got lucky and spiked scum, then maybe the response would contain some association tells or something to go on.<br>\n<br>\nAs serial killer, I don't know why they would care what GM had to say.  Giving a facade of being concerned with her alignment and then killing someone that a vig might kill might give him a good out to later in the game say they're town vig, but if that was the plan, then why did they not claim town vig (I would have believed them)?<br>\n<br>\nI also think serra was probably the best kill for a SK Morph, so the N2 kill makes a lot of sense, but that's kinda null because both implosion and serra made a lot of sense for almost any anti-town player to kill, and we have nothing to go on to determine which role killed whom (except for lolCheery continuing to think we're just going to take his word that scum killed implosion and secondary killer killed serra).<br>\n<br>\nAs for Morph's overall game, I could see it as either power role or scum/SK.  They've been tentative and stayed out of the limelight, and the reads he's offered have been mostly responsive (eg: ~\"My meta reads agree with this; my meta reads differ with that.\"~)  Again, if he'd claimed as vig, I could see why he'd play that way.  As town commuter, I don't see playing tentatively; if anything, they'd be more brazen than vanilla townies.<br>\n<br>\nI guess cliffs would be that I could see the argument for Morph being SK, but Cheery's \"hey guys, I found the SK, let me fill the blanks in with some heresay\" case is laughably overblown.  He's maybe my favorite for SK right now, but far from a lock and seeing as how Cheery's a certainty to be scum, I'd feel much better about lynching him <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">even if</div> we could reasonably guess that it was 2-1-10.", "time": "Fri Aug 16, 2013 3:10 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=29652&start=1175", "forum": "53", "thread": "29652"}

No one doubts there's an SK.  What I'm rolling on the floor about is that you're inclined to believe a confirmed scum (scratch inclined to: just reread your post and said you WILL believe him) and that you think his JK claim is \"genuine\" based on no proof whatsoever.  What did CD say made it seem genuine--that made it unlikely that he could have said it if he were lying.  As far as I remember, all he said was \"I'm JK and I protected the Innocent Child.\"  That seems like something that's very easy for a liar to say.<br>\n<br>\nI mean, he didn't say, \"I\"m uuuuhhhh, ummmmm let me think about this for a second...JK?

Basically, Town needed some quite specific conditions to occur to win in the 3-1-9 setup and the idealistic part of me was hoping it wasn't that setup, but the realistic side of me was saying it was.  A lot of the nightkill permutations I thought of led to 1-1-2 which was basically auto-loss for Town, and I was unsuccessfully trying to think of a way to get to 1-1-3.  <br>\n<br>\nI think I woke up too late - my day two play was passive and unhelpful*.  I was trying to be more active than I usually am to be more 'useful' but I think I ended up being less useful than normal.  Going along with the TR lynch was silly when I had bigger scum-reads at that point (my gut was leaping around telling me not to lynch TR and I ignored it...).  Being the IC influenced my play negatively somehow, I think.  I don't think my day three day was so bad, but it was almost a waste of time at that point...<br>\n<br>\nScum-wise, I had Cheery Dog and NSin down (and morph, I suppose), but not so much surviva.  Even though surviva dropped a few objective scum tells I was focused on other people and not him so much.  I only (properly) read one of his walls and I remember mentally commenting that it hadn't said a lot for being so long, but I never really did anything with that observation or went back to read for more.  I can think of at least three things that bugged me from him when I read them, and retrospectively it seems a bit silly I didn't do anything with it.  I thought the effort was good and that was mainly what led to a Town-read.  And it was good effort, just not Town.  <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\"> <br>\n<br>\nI really wanted to think Naomi was scum but there were things that didn't make sense with her being scum, which is why I couldn't get past the 2-1-10 thing entirely given I hadn't probed my surviva slight town-read enough then.  <br>\n<br>\nI somewhat wish that had been a two-shot vig or something instead of an SK and we could have had a 'normal' LyLo.  I don't really like the \"multi-ball\" type setups conceptually because of the swingy element -- here, it swung against us.  But, GuyInFreezer, thanks for being an active mod!<br>\n<br>\n-<br>\n<br>\n* though, I wasn't the only one.

I thought she was claiming scum at the beginning of day 2 with her wtf why aren't we at LYLO post.<br>\n<br>\nIt's probably more a reflection on how screwed up my towndar sometimes gets when I'm 3rd party, but you worried me from nearly your first post.  I thought the way you went after me on day 1 looked opportunistic.  I talked myself into a town read several times, but it kept shaking loose, mostly because you weren't pushing lynches.  Like me, you were mostly pulling away from lynching on-the-surface questionable people rather than going after your scumreads.  My scumreads were pretty much shit.<br>\n<br>\nI am terrible at reading Cheery and I hate mislynching, which makes me reluctant to go after him.
