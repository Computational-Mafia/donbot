Unvotes are not necessary to change your vote.<br>\n5. During the day, a player will be lynched when they have more than 50% of the players currently alive voting for them. Once that amount has been reached, they're dead. No unvotes will save them. Players can post in the thread up until I post the lynch scene and the thread is locked.<br>\n6.

Nights will have a deadline of 3 days. If you have a night action and do not send one, you will do nothing. If that is what you want to do, you should tell me that so that night can be wrapped up more quickly.<br>\n9. If you're going to be gone for longer than a 60-hour period, post in-thread letting everyone know for how long.<br>\n10. If 60 hours pass without a player posting or saying they will be absent, I will prod them if requested to do so by any other player.<br>\n11.

I didn't expect to be as completely away as I have, but I was sick also.<br>\n<br>\nOn Cheery Dog:  His notion that Basketballstar is scummy over a disagreement about definitions of geometry is dumb.  But I don't know if it's scummy.  That he hasn't come up with any other reasons to further his suspicion make it seem almost like a joke.  He's not trying to convince anyone to vote along with him.  I don't see his geometry stuff as scummy.  <br>\n<br>\nOn Melmond:  I'm seeing a theme of holding back and staying out of scrutiny from Melmond.  Very safe play.  And then he hops on the Cheery Dog wagon, which as I said earlier is a bad one.<br>\n<br>\nOn FUT:  I don't see a fundamental difference between saying you have a null read and saying \"I don't think he is scum.\"  Grammatically, \"I don't think he is scum\" is the inverse of \"I think he is scum.\"  The meaning is that the thought that \"he is scum\" is not in speaker's mind.  I don't think this is a slip, but merely a different way of speaking.  FUT is, however, grammatically correct.  Saying \"I don't think he is scum\" is NOT the same thing as saying \"I think he is town.\"  If that's a common scumtell that I just don't know about, then that's different.  But in terms of proper language, the attacks on FUT over this are wrong.<br>\n<br>\nOn Triangle and Idiotking's attacks on FUT:  Really feels like grasping at straws.  Picking a something to harp on and then going for it relentlessly.  The attacks on FUT are probably the scummiest thing going on right now.  And I think Idiotking's attacks have been more forced.

Thus, if FUT does not think that Cheery is scum, then FUT must think he is town.  There is very obviously a difference between \"I don't think Cheery is scum\" and \"I do not have a scumread on Cheery.\"  As I said before, one requires that you think Cheery is town, the other leaves the possibility of a neutral read.  What's scummy about FUT's posts is that he defended Cheery by effectively saying he wasn't scum, then freaking out and insisting that that wasn't what he meant at all, just that he didn't think he was town OR scum.  Again, if Cheery isn't town and he isn't scum, then what the hell is he?<br>\n<br>\nThe waffling alone is not scummy enough to justify a vote, as townies who aren't thinking could do the same thing.  The overly defensive reaction tips the scale though, because only the very paranoid would get that defensive over a few questions, and for obvious reasons, mafia have more reason to be paranoid than townies.

There are also a couple instances of IIoA (information instead of analysis), such as his post addressing pecanpie's miller claim from a theoretical point of view or the one calling out lurkers, which, combined with the way he cautiously words weak scum reads on the top two wagons and nothing else, makes him very scummy.<br>\n<br>\nHaving written that, I'm now tempted to do this... <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: </span>, <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Hellhound1</span>.", "time": "Tue Aug 21, 2012 8:18 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=23082&start=100", "forum": "53", "thread": "23082"}

If you are having trouble seeing my miller claim as genuine - good - don't take my word for granted, however I am going to continue doing everything to ensure a town win for as long as possible. I will once again state that I would prefer to be lynched before any LYLO situation, neutralising WIFOM that scum can generate from my slot, but until then scumhunting will be my game.<br>\n<br>\nI notice a few people are giving town reads on killerjester. My advice would be to remain skeptical of his motives, <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">especially</div> if Hellhound flips town. Consider the possible association between his slot (FUT) and CD. Consider also that CD's \"reaction test\" created suspicion on players like Hellhound and Lupo, but that CD was not at the helm of that suspicion. His own genius stopped after making the distracting posts, and seems happy enough to have dug himself out of a lynch hole while letting the votes fall onto others.<br>\n<br>\nPlayers that have escaped anything major thus far like pappums rat, Paschendale, Idiot King and Kublai Khan shouldn't be given a free ride to endgame. Note also the \"scumminess\" of NS' early L-1 vote and the rapid wagon that formed on him. Try to discern whether it was a scum-driven lynch on CD <div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">or</div> a scum-driven counter-lynch on NS. Also note basketballstar's confusing series of recent posts, is there a scumslip there?<br>\n<br>\nAnd to anyone I haven't mentioned directly, my advice to town is don't forget about them and don't let them coast along. I would go into further detail on players, but in doing that I feel the basic point of this reflection would get lost: town don't let yourself become passive and lazy.<br>\n<br>\n(Sorry about sounding preachy, I'm just trying as much as possible to be a thorn in the side of scum)", "time": "Tue Aug 28, 2012 6:12 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=23082&start=225", "forum": "53", "thread": "23082"}

I don't like posts that exist just to say \"Hi, I'm here, I'm town, goooo town you should totally scumhunt and stuff.\"  I do find it funny that pecanpie suggests people examine those of us who haven't gone under any major scrutiny (when he hadn't been pressured much either), and then he immediately gets pressured.<br>\n<br>\nI think CheeryDog hit on something though when he called out pecanpie's <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4295933#p4295933\" class=\"postlink\">250</a>, when pecanpie said he wanted it to look truthful.  While I don't necessarily think that pecanpie slipped there specifically, it does seem that some of pecanpie's recent posts (including 246 and 250 when he talks about building up town cred to give his advice more umph) are intended to shore up his townie image.  I hate people saying that they should be treated as confirmed townie, even if they offer to be lynched before LYLO, because scum seen as confirmed townie can still lead the town in circles to protect their friends.<br>\n<br>\nI don't think this is enough to make pecanpie worthy of a vote (because admittedly townies still want to look townie to prevent a mislynch), but there seems to be an unnecessary amount of effort directed to improving his image.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4296612#p4296612\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4296612#p4296612\" data-post-id=\"4296612\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 266</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9811\">Kublai Khan</a> wrote:</cite>@Cheery Dog: we aren't lynching pieceofpecanpiece today, so I dontknow why you're wasting valuable pre-deadline time talk to and about him.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nOh dear, it's Hellhound all over again.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">FOS Kublai Khan</div> for basically saying that we should only focus on who is most likely to be lynched today.

You tunneled Lupo from the start and didn't offer a single opinion until you sheeped KK's argument and spat it out at me.  And it was ridiculously weak, and based off of 1) the very reasonable criticism of a L-1 vote without sufficient reason, and 2) asking for a claim from someone already at L-1.

It was incredibly innocuous and spoke more of just being polite to someone subbing in than anything else.  But you had to go and make a big deal out of it.  That's your play here.  Making big deals out of nothing.  You've posted nothing of any merit, and you're pretty clearly trying to lead town to lynch for astoundingly bad reasons.<br>\n<br>\nThis has been bugging me for a while, but I couldn't articulate it quite so well until now.

However, he never actually laid a vote down on CD and continued to not give reads, and of course, his scummy jump onto the NS wagon has been beaten to death so I won't go into it, but I do believe this argument holds merit. And finally, I really don't like his interactions with Hellhound because by consistently saying \"I don't agree with this case\" but not trying to stop it, it looks like he was really just trying to get town cred. <br>\n<br>\nI still need to do an iso on Melmond, but I thought it would be more important for me to get some content out first and catch up with the day so far.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>pecanpie wrote:</cite><br>\nHmmm, diving straight into wagons and no comment on the lack of nightkill?<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nI don't think there's much to say since set-up speculation won't be fruitful at this time.

Lupo's insistence that Hellhound was town - thus staying off his wagon - has been contrasted by a number of his own actions. <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">eg. not calling for a counter lynch, lurking, not making it clear cut why we shouldn't have lynched Hellhound</div> Hellhound's flip does not indemnify Lupo, on the contrary it makes me wonder how deep the rabbit hole goes with Lupo's motives.<br>\n<br>\n2. As a follow up to that last point, me thinks the rabbit hole could go <div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">beyond</div> Lupo <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">eg. players such as Cheery Dog, Kublai Khan and killerjester</div> However, there is enough validation to lynch Lupo on his own merits and whether this may or may not instigate follow up questions in the next Day is yet to be seen. That does not mean I'm passively lining up lynches, I'm merely remarking that Lupo's flip is valuable in its own rights, but the potential for further information on other players to stem from his lynch is very real. That is a mixture of gut feeling and the next point...<br>\n<br>\n3. Lupo was the Day 1 counter wagon to Hellhound. As a rule that could mean scum were voting Lupo (Kublai Khan, BBStar, killerjester). Lupo has also made various scummy/anti-town plays, mentioned - but not limited to - the points in 1., so there's a possibility he will and benefit to Lupo flipping either way.<br>\n<br>\nMy basic premise is that we nail scum, or find scum through Lupo.", "time": "Mon Sep 17, 2012 11:36 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=23082&start=450", "forum": "53", "thread": "23082"}

For example,<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4284779#p4284779\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4284779#p4284779\" data-post-id=\"4284779\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 160</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=17299\">pieceofpecanpie</a> wrote:</cite> My reasons for doing so are thus: it puts town in a stronger position with at least one conf town to begin with,</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nas well as basically all of post 246 and the discussion that followed.  He seems particularly interested in appearing to be town.  His reaction in post 253 is also interesting, since (as Paschendale pointed out) it is one big OMGUS.  If is effectively screaming \"CD is scum because he does not buy my miller claim.\"  His defensive whining about any sort of suspicion leveled at him after 246 may also be suspicious, but only given his apparent urge to have a good townie image.<br>\n<br>\nAs for his general play, on D1 he seemed to have done remarkably little scumhunting of his own, always following after others.  He followed me on FUT, followed triangle on Hellhound, and followed killerjester on Lupo (admittedly this is the weakest example, as in 170 he gave different reasons for going after Lupo than killerjester).  Pecanpie only seemed to follow the general moods of the town.  While this may be fair in some cases, like if someone provides a particularly strong case against someone, it gets to where it's a little unusual when it happens over and over again.  Also, pecanpie (rightly) indicates that scumhunting should involve asking questions, as here:<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4285960#p4285960\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4285960#p4285960\" data-post-id=\"4285960\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 170</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=17299\">pieceofpecanpie</a> wrote:</cite><br>\nHis <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4284672#p4284672\" class=\"postlink\">#155</a> pinged because it was a pro-town speech that completely sidestepped an important element for good townplay: asking questions.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nAnd yet through all of D1 pecanpie asked no significant questions.  Never once to my knowledge did he ever directly question someone he thought was suspect.  Sure, he posted a lot of information about the suspects and came up with theories, like a Lupo/Hellhound scumteam, but he didn't ask any hard questions.  Also of note is the fact that in post 326 pecanpie expressed suspicion of killerjester and CD (both of whom were suspicious of him by that point), and yet did absolutely NO scumhunting on these two for the entire time until post 455 against killerjester, which was more of a response post.  The only thing he did in the meantime was vote for killerjester (immediately following Paschendale's 378, a MASSIVE defense of Lupo and claiming that killerjester is scum) with no argument attached, only to change it later because no one else was following him.<br>\n<br>\nIn reading pecanpie I've come to notice a general shift in his play ever since the pressure on 246.  Beforehand he was distant, bouncy, and acted positive.  Ever since he's been very defensive and angry.  This is more of a feeling having read all of his posts in ISO though, so take it with a grain of salt.<br>\n<br>\nOverall I find pecanpie scummy for the reasons listed above.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">FOS pecanpie</div><br>\n<br>\n---------------------<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">killerjester:</div><br>\n<br>\nRight off the bat I like his play style much more than pecanpie, because he actually asks freakin' questions, and a whole lot of them.  He started in hard on Lupo very shortly after he joined, arguing against him based on NS's L-1 vote on CD, which Lupo at first went along with and later questioned.  He seemed to be reluctant to rush to end D1, waiting for the deadline and such.  This could be taken either as him being town for wanting the town to slow down and not rush into a bad lynch, or scum trying to distance from what he knew was a town lynch, so this is null.  Killerjester then rightly calls out pecanpie for asking about whether Hellhound should be replaced and using circular reasoning in defense of his miller claim (\"I am town, so you can trust me when I say that I am town\").<br>\n<br>\nThen in posts 372-377 he re-argues his case against Lupo, this time adding in the accusation that Lupo was wasting his vote on NS while Hellhound (who Lupo claimed was not scummy) was being lynched.  I agree that if Lupo thought the cases on the Hellhound wagon were bad he should have picked apart the reasoning and scumhunted.  The big thing about these posts is that they lead to Paschendale's 378, which I will examine in more detail when I get to him.  This of course gave pecanpie the chance to hop on killerjester.<br>\n<br>\nOverall I have a town read of killerjester.  His arguments generally seem solid, he asks a lot of questions, his thinking is consistent (by this I mean that he has not waffled), and he seems genuinely interested in catching scum.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n---------------------<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Paschendale</div>:<br>\n<br>\nSurprisingly less active than I had assumed.  Starts out by going after me about my argument against FUT, basically saying that I was twisting FUT's words into saying that CD was town instead of implying a null read.  Then Paschendale pounces on NS for his L-1 vote without reasoning.  In a beautiful twist (given his 378), Paschendale basically reiterates Melmond's 122, which talked about NS lurking, putting CD at L-1, and asked NS to give a reason for his CD vote.  Then in 171 he follows triangle and pecanpie in their attacks on Hellhound while providing no input of his own other than saying that he agrees with their arguments.  He then appropriately calls out pecanpie's 253 for being OMGUS.<br>\n<br>\nPaschendale has been exceptionally cold toward arguments about Lupo.  In 205 he dismissed the case against Lupo, then in 374 called Lupo town for saying that Hellhound was town (which is absurd, since Lupo scum could have been distancing from the wagon, so Paschendale is seeing a towntell where the exact opposite should be true).  And then Paschendale's magnum opus, 378, his massive defense of Lupo by attacking killerjester.  The first chunk of it is mostly just saying \"nuh uh\" to killerjester's arguments that a town player would question a wagon that was supposedly based on bad reasoning.  Then we get to this:<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4319054#p4319054\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4319054#p4319054\" data-post-id=\"4319054\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 378</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=14288\">Paschendale</a> wrote:</cite><br>\nI'm not willing to give a definite read on Lupo.

You are arguing that the case against Lupo is bad and trying to point out reasons why.  That is scumhunting.  However, you let Lupo slide without giving a reason for why the Hellhound wagon was bad.  So how come it's OK for Lupo to forego scumhunting an iffy wagon?  This indicates that you are not just pointing out 'flaws' in the case against Lupo (if that were all then you'd be fine even if I didn't agree with your arguments), but willing to let him get away with scumtells, turning your arguments into protection.

Lupo did not explain why the Hellhound wagon was bad.  If he did, and if his arguments were solid, maybe then it would be town.

There are no questions directed at me there, so I suppose I'll give a bit of an overall view.<br>\n<br>\nOn the whole it's a well written and articulate story, given - and I'm sure you'd happily agree to this - your somewhat lax involvement thus far it's appreciated that you would go to a bit of effort on analysing a few players. As such it could be a valuable reference down the track. (This was my initial impression when I first read it and didn't feel obligated to share that)<br>\n<br>\nDo I agree with your assertion that I'm scummy? No, of course not, but I can't see anything wrong with the way you've exercised your opinion and the research you've done.<br>\n<br>\nThe was one particular thing you said that I found very interesting:<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4345062#p4345062\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4345062#p4345062\" data-post-id=\"4345062\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 486</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10647\">Idiotking</a> wrote:</cite>In reading pecanpie I've come to notice a general shift in his play ever since the pressure on 246.  Beforehand he was distant, bouncy, and acted positive.  Ever since he's been very defensive and angry.  This is more of a feeling having read all of his posts in ISO though, so take it with a grain of salt.</div></blockquote><br>\nThat's a very astute observation you've made there. I'd say it's quite accurate.<br>\n<br>\nI never admitted it, but pappum's calls for a vig to kill me really affected my attitude to the game. I felt sapped of enthusiasm, I felt I was putting in effort and that it got thrown back in my face in a negative way. Stupid of me to take it so heavy, but I did and it took some time to adjust.<br>\n<br>\nAlso, I'm certainly not blaming pappum's for causing that. I'm confident it was completely unintentional. The flaws I found were in my own gameplay, one big one is making a post like #246 without reminding myself that there is no double jeopardy in mafiascum. Therefore, there's every chance that the validity of my claim can be brought up at any point, even if a majority of players agreed to what it said about my alignment previously, there's no reason that can't be questioned later and rightfully so. I hung my own noose by readdressing it, and instead of icing on the cake for my post it became a magnet of suspicion. Or it could also have been a significant opportunity for scum to discredit me. But those are pieces of another story to come later. Either way, I set that in motion and I've adjusted my gameplay since to ensure that people don't have to just trust that I'm saying things for the right reasons.

I believe CD's claim because (1) he's been appearing townier to me since the start of Day 2ish and (2) his claim would be very risky as scum since pecanpie's miller claim implies there's a cop in the set-up. Even if pecanpie and CD are scum together, it's still quite risky to claim cop. If CD is town, Melmond is most likely town, barring bus driver or godfather or what-have-you. BBS, pecanpie, and killerjester are all fairly solid town reads of mine, so I'll eliminate them as well. <br>\n<br>\nThis leaves NS, Innocent, Idiotking, and KK. <br>\n<br>\nA lot of NS' actual content strikes me as null just because he hasn't exactly been a huge contributor to the game or anything, and for a while I did suspect that his wagon was scum-driven simply because he seems like an easy target to jump on, but I agree with the analysis someone else made a few posts earlier in light of the flips about how NS' wagon was more town-driven. His interactions with Lupo seem to be mostly defensive since he makes statements like \"I'm not really seeing the case on Lupo\", but then later he flip-flopped a bit and called Lupo his second biggest scum read. That in conjunction with Lupo's interactions with NS makes me put him in the leaning town category.<br>\n<br>\nAs for Innocent, I did another review of pappums' iso and I'm not sure what I was thinking before but his iso strikes me as rather townish in that I agreed with a lot of what he said (at the time and in the context of the given post, of course) and his thinking processes felt very town and natural.

It gives them a chance to get another PR at night.  If the town believes the claim then sure, scum can NK the PR, but again, that is only if they believe the claim.  The case we're talking about is whether or not scum would have been right to kill Paschendale if they assumed he was a PR.  Since Paschendale's claim would have almost certainly been ignored given the overwhelming amount of evidence against him, even if he were a PR, he would most likely have been lynched.

You do not have the mindset of a pro-town player. Anyone not voting Idiotking either needs to rectify this or justify themselves in their next post.<br>\n<br>\nAt the end of D1 he is equally comfortable with either a Hellhound or Lupo lynch. At the start of D2 he abandons his weak bus on Lupo to start attacking BBstar for AtE'ing. This is the definition of opportunistic scum. At the end of D2 he is talking about how scum Lupo/Paschendale are attacking NS because he's an easy target, implying that NS isn't scum. At the start of D3 he attacks NS largely due to an analysis of a nightkill that was completely unexpected. NS is the easiest target in the game.<br>\n<br>\nHe's had a serious hard-on for the nightkill. Virtually all of his thinking seems to center around that one aspect. In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4376946#p4376946\" class=\"postlink\">#615</a> he demonstrates an understanding that nightkills should not be used authoritatively (unexpected nightkills, even more so).

His initial posts in the game focused almost exclusively on FUT, and then all of a sudden he dropped the issue and never mentioned him again, turning instead to Hellhound and Lupo. I would expect someone who had such a strong early read on someone to follow up in some way, either by saying how they felt about the player that caused them to unvote or talking about FUT's replacement. Even odder, his listed reason for having Lupo as a scumread was because he agreed with something killerjester said, a slot he previously thought was scum. <br>\n<br>\nThis FoS is a bit scummy as well:<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Idiotking wrote:</cite><br>\nFOS Kublai Khan for basically saying that we should only focus on who is most likely to be lynched today.

{"number": 659, "id": "4390287", "user": "Idiotking", "user_id": "10647", "content": "Ok, you guys want a claim?  Fine.<br>\n<br>\nI am the town doctor.  On N1 I protected Melmond and on N2 I protected killerjester.  The fact that there was no N1 NK either means that Melmond is definitely town or that the scum are so inactive that they didn't even notice that there was a night phase.  I assume this because for a town to have a doctor, cop, vig, AND roleblocker would just be overpowered in a mini normal.<br>\n<br>\nI'm beginning to think that killerjester is not so town as I thought, though this may just be OMGUS talking.  I may have been wrong in my assumption that the scum would be inactive, or at least that both remaining scum are.  I was making it clear on D2 that I was going to go after Paschendale.  Scum might have killed him on the off chance that I would go after NS like this, and then twist my words to make it look like I'm scummy (I <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">am</div> scummy, I know that, but not for the reasons killerjester has claimed.)  <br>\n<br>\nNow here's a bit of evidence from D3 that I think is interesting.  Killerjester has gone after me for my supposed turnaround against NS, but other than the fact that I never said NS was town (<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">ever</div></div>), my reasoning for going after him was based in the reasoning behind the N2 kill, or lack thereof.  Killerjester further claimed that he didn't care about the reasoning behind the NK.  But earlier he said:<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4371762#p4371762\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4371762#p4371762\" data-post-id=\"4371762\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 587</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=16287\">killerjester</a> wrote:</cite>Please, Paschendale would've been all too easy to lynch today. It's more likely that the scum wasn't paying attention to the thread.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nIsn't that sort of what I've been saying all along?  And if we're opening the door for inactives to be the scum, why is NS <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">not</div> a good target, based on the NK?  See, killerjester is coming after me for things that he himself has stated.  I don't understand why a townie would do that.  What I DO understand is why the town would follow killerjester so eagerly, since he was right about Lupo.  But that does not necessarily mean he is town.  Scum bus each other all the time, and if killerjester thought Lupo would be a liability when he replaced into the game, then it's reasonable that he would bus until Lupo died, because that would secure his read as town for almost everybody.<br>\n<br>\nIn saying this I'm <div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">not</div> claiming that killerjester is scum.  What I'm saying is that there is no reason for people to assume he is town.  Killerjester is null at best.  I have several problems with why the town has been so eager to follow him.  1, his scumpool from today was only 4 people.  I think it's silly for the town as a whole to be OK with limiting themselves to 4 people.  Sure, if killerjester thought that scum were in those 4, then by all means, he should examine them.  <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">But the whole town shouldn't</div>.<br>\n<br>\nSomething I failed to respond to was this:<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4379097#p4379097\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4379097#p4379097\" data-post-id=\"4379097\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 628</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=16805\">triangle123</a> wrote:</cite><br>\nThis FoS is a bit scummy as well:<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Idiotking wrote:</cite><br>\nFOS Kublai Khan for basically saying that we should only focus on who is most likely to be lynched today.

CES had only replaced Triangle four minutes before voting, so clearly didn't have time to read anything (though if he continues in this behavior he will definitely be suspect).  You have no such excuse.  You've been here since D1, and have read the thread.  Thus, making unexplained votes and waiting until I ask for an explanation to give one is far worse coming from you.<br>\n<br>\nAt any rate, I don't buy your case against Triangle.  It seems to me to be more of an after-the-fact excuse.  Like, \"I voted Triangle, but I guess now I've got to come up with a reason.\"  You were flat out wrong about Triangle distancing herself from Lupo, and I don't like \"these reads feel fabricated\" stuff.  People don't have to interact directly with each other to build reads.  They can look at how they interact with others and make a judgement.  I hadn't interacted with you significantly before I gave my read of you, pecanpie, and Paschendale.  Similarly, you had hardly interacted with Triangle before proclaiming her scum.  Now you may be right about Triangle not really giving a clear reason why a Hellhound flip would indicate anything about BBstar, but that alone is not worthy of a vote.", "time": "Thu Oct 11, 2012 7:43 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=23082&start=700", "forum": "53", "thread": "23082"}

{"number": 753, "id": "4400576", "user": "Kublai Khan", "user_id": "9811", "content": "Has Cogito Ergo Sum read the game yet? Because his vote on me is hella bad.<br>\n<br>\nOkay, so here's the situation. Early into this game I got a new job. It has long hours, plus a longish commute, plus family time, plus sleep. So I can follow along pretty well, but I've been struggling to pin down time for an extensive analysis. Which is what I've been needed to do in this game, especially since the beginning of Day 2.<br>\n<br>\nIf you remember the end of and twilight period of Day 1, pappums rat was going off on pieceofpecanpie for the \"conf town\" comment. He was way too aggressive and directing the vig so strongly that it was scummy as hell. I called him out on it and he realized that I was absolutely correct. <br>\n<br>\nThen at the beginning of Day 2, pappums rat mae culpa'd and listed his reads with triangle123 as top town with no reasoning. I read that as a soft-cop claim and that's when I skidded off having this game in hand. Whether it was legit or a fakeclaim, I had to let it play out and not call attention to it. So my top suspect at the time was off the table and I needed to re-read and generate new reads. But as aformentioned I lacked the time to do so.<br>\n<br>\nSo I lazily and easily called attention to Nobody Special, whom I know to be a notorious lurker, to buy time to get a re-read in. He made promises that he was changing his meta and was going to be active, but wasn't. I managed some ISO re-reading here and there, but nothing jumped out at me, so I leaned on Nobody Special a little harder to at the very least generate a counter-wagon to see what information would shake out in the long run.<br>\n<br>\nLupo flipped scum, which means that I definitely needed to re-read with that info in mind and just kept putting it off until I had time and I finally made time.<br>\n<br>\nSo here's my notes from my re-read:<br>\n<br>\nApparent setup:<br>\nVigilante (flipped)<br>\nMiller (claimed)<br>\nEven-Night Cop (claimed --- N2:Melmond-INNO)<br>\nOdd-Night Cop (claimed --- N1:triangle123-INNO)<br>\nDoctor (claimed)<br>\nVanilla (flipped)<br>\nVanilla (claimed)<br>\nUnknown x5<br>\nGoon (flipped)<br>\n<br>\nFirst, given that the two cop claims fit each other like a jigsaw puzzle and there's no counter-claims, so they are cleared. I believe the miller claim since he made it early and his play has been overall okay (170 stands up as town), which means that balance-wise a godfather role is a strong possibility.<br>\n<br>\nAfter Cheery Dog's wagon fell apart post-claim, but before Hellhound1's lynch, killerjester tried to spearhead a Lupo-wagon and kept the tunnel going through the next day until he was successful. No bus is ever that strong, so killerjester is my strongest town-read.<br>\n<br>\nOf the two targets of investigation, nothing triangle123 has done stands out as scummy. Conversely, I'm not getting why so many people have a town-read on Melmond. Consider <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4338528#p4338528\">Post 459</a>, it's an attempt to bunk the Lupo wagon. He acknowledges all the legitimate reasons for the wagon (that killerjester just recently provided in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4332285#p4332285\">Post 432</a> &amp; <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4333309#p4333309\">Post 440</a>), but ends with \"if people could explain and push his case, so I can understand it better, that would be good.\" <br>\n<br>\nWhen re-reading, I was getting ready to push a Paschendale case when I caught up. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4346806#p4346806\">Post 504</a> looked like such a scummy backpedal in a \"I wasn't defending my soon-to-flip scum-buddy\" sense that he needed to taste rope unless there was someone better. So I was thrown off by the fact that he was night-killed. So, why? Well, the reason behind the NK choice isn't important, but whoever uses it to push a narrative is scummy. To that end, I found myself heavily agreeing with killerjester that Idiotking is scummy for pushing theory theory that scum \"must not be paying attention\". However he claimed doc, so he'll have to keep the cops alive.<br>\n<br>\nNobody Special and basketballstar24 are my wildcards at the moment. Lupo was weakly pushing them while he was being lynched so I want to give them a mild town-tell, but I really want them to justify a town-read on them.<br>\n<br>\nI think I got everyone.

You had reads and thoughts, but couldn't find time or were too lazy to put them forward, and so parked your vote on NS for the majority of the game and - if I'm understanding this correctly - offer a flimsy backdoor argument to why it should've been on IAI.<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Then at the beginning of Day 2, pappums rat mae culpa'd and listed his reads with triangle123 as top town with no reasoning. I read that as a soft-cop claim and that's when I skidded off having this game in hand. Whether it was legit or a fakeclaim, I had to let it play out and not call attention to it. So my top suspect at the time was off the table and I needed to re-read and generate new reads. But as aformentioned I lacked the time to do so.</div></blockquote><br>\nOnce you move to the re-read section of your post, you seem to clear IAI entirely on account of his claim and make no further attempt to explain why you hastily put him at L-1 in the first place.<br>\n<br>\nSo let's look at your vote:<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I'm down with an I Am Innocent lynch today.<br>\n<br>\nvote: I Am Innocent (L-1)<br>\n<br>\nReasons tomorrow.</div></blockquote><br>\nFirstly, <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">reasons</div> denote multiple ones and you've barely managed one. Some idea about exploring the legitimacy of a soft cop claim in #359 that you never got around to? And this is justification for your \"<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">yes, let's lynch him</div>\" vote? Also worth noting that this was the main point IAI used to defend his claim, so I'm extremely skeptical on you having any thoughts towards #359 to begin with.<br>\n<br>\nSecondly, in #753 you shy away from your vote by concentrating on delivering reads on other players. It's a pleasant summary and all, but what I really want to hear was why you did what you did? Why should I believe you? And how can you explain it as a townie action? I don't think you've satisfied any of these reasons. Your motivation remains murky, and rehashing some reads and conjecture of other players feels like an effort to distract rather than be useful.<br>\n<br>\nThirdly, you use the word laziness to describe yourself, but I find your latest burst of activity anything but lazy. This is in contrast to NS who gets ridiculed for his activity levels and then makes no effort to hide the sheer token nature of an appearance. Amazingly, he has not slipped up like you have. And that is what I am putting to you, Kublai Khan, your vote was an opportunistic lynch attempt that became a scummy slip and your recent burst of posts are not for the sake of benefiting town, but for the sake of saving yourself.<br>\n<br>\nLastly, in the vein of that previous statement, your large response made no recommendations for who scum are or who town should be focusing on. For all your words the end result is not a rallying roar pointing at the true scum, it is a helpless and subjective whisper. It gets us nowhere, and a townie under voting pressure shouldn't go down so quietly, keeping scum reads in a shroud of mysticism from the rest of town isn't right.<br>\n<br>\nThat's why I'm saying that you, Kublai Khan, are scum, and I encourage those who aren't voting him already to help lynch this guy.", "time": "Sat Oct 13, 2012 3:11 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=23082&start=750", "forum": "53", "thread": "23082"}

Even if the town had one more power role, with that setup, a roleblocker was more likely, so doc seemed to be a pretty safe bet.<br>\n<br>\nFantastic cop play by the way, IAI and Cheery Dog.  2 scum in a row is pretty amazing.", "time": "Mon Oct 22, 2012 6:10 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=23082&start=825", "forum": "53", "thread": "23082"}
