You may not quote private Moderator-supplied information (either real or fabricated) of any kind. Paraphrasing (for role claims, etc.) is acceptable.<br>\n2. There is to be NO personal communication outside of the forum postings unless your role PM specifically allows it. Mafia members may communicate at night and during the confirmation stage.<br>\n3. If you have a role with a Night action your choices are due to me by the posted deadline. If I do not receive your choice via PM or bolded in the quick-topic provided by the posted deadline you will forfeit your actions.<br>\n4. Roles with Night actions will not be able to submit an action on Night 0 (i.e. during the confirmation stage).<br>\n5. Any player with a Night action may instead submit a &#8220;No Action&#8221; PM to let the Mod know that you do not want to perform your expected action that Night phase.<br>\n6. As a general rule you should aim for one post every 48 hours, minimum, to keep the game moving.<br>\n<br>\nVoting, Deadlines, and Player Death:<br>\n1. A simple majority of all living members must agree on one person for a lynch to occur prior to deadline.<br>\n2. Once you have reached a simple majority no further unvoting will change someone&#8217;s fate.<br>\n3. Once a player is lynched the game enters twilight until I post a death scene; all players including the one who was lynched may continue to post during twilight.<br>\n4. Please submit votes as: Vote: PlayerName or VOTE: PlayerName. Votes will NOT be counted if they are not bold! Obvious abbreviations or nicknames will be counted so long as they are unambiguous.<br>\n5. Please submit vote revocations as either Unvote: PlayerName or Unvote. Unvotes are not necessary before changing votes.<br>\n6. You may Vote: No Lynch - a simple majority of these vote types are required to send the game to Night phase without a lynch.<br>\n7. This game will have 3 week deadlines. At deadline, if there is not a simple majority of votes there will be No Lynch.<br>\n<br>\nMiscellaneous/Mechanics:<br>\n1. Bold, blue text is reserved for the Mod. No invisible/small text is allowed, nor is cryptography.<br>\n2. If you have an issue/problem with the game, please PM the Mod privately. Do not post issues/complaints in the game thread.<br>\n3. The Mod may make mistakes - please point out any mistakes gently. Mistakes will be corrected where possible, but sometimes mistakes are made that cannot be reversed. These will stand as final to be commiserated over after the game.<br>\n4. Please bold all requests to the Mod so that they don&#8217;t get missed.<br>\n5. Prods of missing players will be issued automatically after 72 hours of no activity or upon request after 48 hours of no activity. A prodded player has 48 hours to respond or risks replacement. A player who has been prodded 3 times is subject to replacement without further notice.<br>\n6. Rule violations will be dealt with according to their severity, up to and including a Modkill.<br>\n7. If you anticipate being unavailable for more than a 48-hour period please post a notice to that effect in the thread. Treat this game as a commitment. Be considerate &#8211; don&#8217;t leave us hanging.<br>\n<br>\nHere is the Role PM for a Vanilla Townie, at least one person has received this PM.<br>\n<br>\nVanilla Townie<br>\nWelcome, you are a Vanilla Townie.<br>\nAbilities:<br>\nYour weapon is your vote, you have no night actions.<br>\nWin condition:<br>\nYou win when all threats to the town have been eliminated and there is at least one town player alive.<br>\nYou can find the game thread here: _______<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#0000FF\">Please confirm your role via PM<br>\nThe game will open once 10 players have confirmed.</div></div>", "time": "Fri Mar 13, 2015 6:19 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=61056&start=0", "forum": "53", "thread": "61056"}

This was in open #586 (don't worry, it IS over).<br>\n<br>\nThe reason I voted for Slandaar is because he intended to use a post which has no bearing on a player's alignment or role (my first one of the game), as a reaction test, a pointless one at that because said post contained NOTHING alignment-indicative and was merely an explanatory post as to any delay in my posting, the \"other things\" part was because I am busy during the day most of the time, meaning I only post in the mornings/nights some days and was intended to be a blanket term for such things.<br>\n<br>\nI would also like to say that in my experience, I HAVE seen someone claim in their first post, although that claim was a character not a role (might as well have been one since it more-or-less revealed their role, VT), it would have had the same affect as mine.  IMO it either reduced scum's possible options or made them want to target him more, in this case it was the former since we never bothered to touch him until later in the game.

Second of all, I came to the conclusion that Slandaar's post was trying to gauge reactions was after he revealed that he was imitating me, if you look at the posts between #9 and #21 (when he imitated me and when he revealed it respectively), you will see burn_209's vote for him (if this was an RVS vote please feel free to correct me), Cheetory6's vote on him because of his same post, Slandarr's subsequent question as to why they were voting for him and not me, along with a short conversation between Cheetory6 and Wickedest about my first post, later on Cheetory revealed that he was referring to Slandaar all that time NOT my post.<br>\n<br>\nAfter reading back through thoes relevant posts, I started thinking that he was trying to see exactly HOW other players would react to such a post, whilst mine came off as newbie explaining everything, a quick look at Slandaar's profile revealed that he has been around for 3 years more then me, reaffirming my opinion that his post was to gauge other player's reactions.  I also noticed that he lives in a timezone which allows him to be online at the same time that other players are.  Which made me ask, if he lived in such a time zone, WHY would he make such a post if not to try to get people to react so he can determine whether they are scum or town.  I voted for him, because I knew that his post was a (pretty poor excuse for a) reaction test OR that he was lying to give himself an excuse to lurk, something that scum are probably more likely to do then town, (I did not mention the lying part earlier because it had not dawned on me that it could have been the case until after I had gone offline for the day).", "time": "Mon Mar 16, 2015 9:17 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=61056&start=100", "forum": "53", "thread": "61056"}

Despite the fact you acknowledge that <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6678485#p6678485\">this has no bearing on whether or not they could be scum</a>.

If you need clarification on these suspicions lemme know.  You may note that being easy targets wasn't one of my reasons.  As for your opinion that they are they easiest targets....that's pretty subjective (at least at   4 pages into the game IMO).  Whether or not any of the suspicions I have voiced correspond to \"metatells\" I do not know and do not care.  Having not played with either kelbris or idget...I do not know what their habits are and I do not know or care if they are easy lynches.  You also make note of ignoring your \"dumbfuck\" handling of Slandaar and his wagon.  Is that part of your reason for voting me as well? <br>\n<br>\nAs for my point about you criticizing Slandaar for useless posting while at the same time applauding him for critical thinking...we'll just have to disagree.  It seems contradictory to me.  While at the same time adding that he could still be scum.

That's what idget did and is part of the reason I am voting him.   Why are you trying to make explanations on idget's behalf to defend his 1-post based town read on kelbris?  What does lazy or not have to do with anything?  And at the point I placed my vote on him...low content wasn't a factor.  Since my vote....his low output (~disappearance) and the quality of his body of posts has become more obvious and not done him any favors. <br>\n<br>\nIf any of this in unclear...lemme know.

Slandaar also said that Riblet's ISO (up until post #176 at least) contained no content, when I looked in Riblet's ISO, I found LOTS of content, seems to me like Slandaar only added parts of the ISO that would help his case, further cementing him as a scum in my book.</div></blockquote><br>\nKelbris your post amused me greatly so thank you.<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6690477#p6690477\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6690477#p6690477\" data-post-id=\"6690477\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 203</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=24986\">kelbris</a> wrote:</cite><br>\njust because someone votes \"late in the game\" does NOT mean that they voted only because someone else said something<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\nUh yes it does in this case.<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6673678#p6673678\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6673678#p6673678\" data-post-id=\"6673678\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 42</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=25497\">Riblet</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6673659#p6673659\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6673659#p6673659\" data-post-id=\"6673659\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 40</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=24704\">Cheetory6</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6673275#p6673275\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6673275#p6673275\" data-post-id=\"6673275\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 20</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=24704\">Cheetory6</a> wrote:</cite>Kelbris feels more like new player explaining everything he does.<br>\nNot getting same vibes from Slandaar.</div></blockquote></div></blockquote><br>\nCause he's not a newb</div></blockquote><br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6673804#p6673804\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6673804#p6673804\" data-post-id=\"6673804\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 45</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=25497\">Riblet</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6673156#p6673156\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6673156#p6673156\" data-post-id=\"6673156\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 12</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=11821\">havingfitz</a> wrote:</cite>Any alts in this game?</div></blockquote><br>\nForgot this, I'm an alt but not telling anyone who I am</div></blockquote><br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6673880#p6673880\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6673880#p6673880\" data-post-id=\"6673880\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 49</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=25497\">Riblet</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6673813#p6673813\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6673813#p6673813\" data-post-id=\"6673813\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 46</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=22559\">Aeronaut</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6673804#p6673804\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6673804#p6673804\" data-post-id=\"6673804\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 45</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=25497\">Riblet</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6673156#p6673156\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6673156#p6673156\" data-post-id=\"6673156\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 12</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=11821\">havingfitz</a> wrote:</cite>Any alts in this game?</div></blockquote><br>\nForgot this, I'm an alt but not telling anyone who I am</div></blockquote><br>\nhey we can be secret alt friends</div></blockquote><br>\nSure.

I think that we could all pretty much post that we are going to be active when we can be, but there may be times where we are doing other things. You could probably get away with just saying where you live, or you could go crazy and actually put it in your information instead of putting the Internet. If I saw someone who lived in Australia playing my expectations would already be different for them. Also, no need to designate a vote as RVS during RVS. &#8220;that way you do not suddenly see me as \"lurking\" when in actuality I could be simply busy or preoccupied&#8221; Can you show where you were accused of lurking like this? And how would we determine the times where you are otherwise occupied or lurking? #65 ::facepalm::. Just ::facepalm::. Everything anyone said about how bad a decision you made is 100% correct, Wicked put it best though in #79. What makes you think that Slandaars post was a reaction test? How do you know it is a pointless one unless you understand what information he could possibly get from it? Your premise for believing that Slandaar was running a reaction test that early is flawed. Burn and Cheet both misunderstood something that Slandaar thought was self evident. Jesus Christ, it seems like he was making fun of you, that&#8217;s how I took it.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Slandaar</div>- I got the joke man, not sure how so many people were clueless about it. Do you think that was dumbassery or scum trying to jump on something little and missing something bigger?<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Burn</div>- Did you feel the breeze when Slandaars joke flew over your head? Post #24 I need to make sure you didn&#8217;t mess up here &#8220;In fact I cant remember the last time I was in a game and we lynched someone because of inactivity and that person flipped town&#8221; because your first statement sounds like you think scum doesn&#8217;t lurk much, but the quoted one sounds like you lynch accurately off activity.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">FA_Q2</div>- Do you find something scummy about voting for a wagon? Is everyone&#8217;s funny bones busted in this game? People are missing super obvious jests at people and taking it as scummy.  Why did you avoid any of the votes that could have started a wagon? Have you played with Massive before? He will carry his weight, just worry about yourself for the time being and everything will be dandy. Decent questions to Cheet, you get some town points. You do seem to lack the ability to accurately identify OMGUS though. Massive simply looked at your iso to see if you were one to walk the walk or just talk the talk, he appears to have weighed and measured you and you have been found wanting.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline-flex;text-decoration:line-through\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Cheetory</div>- I really hope to see you improve as the game goes, I have read like the first 5 pages and am disappointed in your play so far. I am going to try to not discuss much of the misunderstanding because I saw that it gets cleared by around page 5, but Jesus man that whole line of investigation was all sorts of bad. I am having a hard time believing you didn&#8217;t get the joke because it was so apparent to me on my first read through that Slandaar was being facetious. Even in the face of people telling you that you are reading it wrong you kept it up for far longer than you should have. I wonder if this is a case of &#8220;scum sticking with a stupid read for longer than scum should, so he must be town&#8221; bullshit that most people believe. Also, I do find it funny you tell someone to retrace your thought process, but are unable to do so yourself. I hope you feel like kind of a dick for #31. I love when people are overly dickish because they think they understand something that others have missed and feel superior for it.  #88 &#8220;Weps. I'm officially being shit this game. Sorry.&#8221; Admitting you have a problem is the first step in recovery. We are here for you Cheet. &#8220;Slandaar might be scum for how hard he&#8217;s trying to seem like he&#8217;s doing something useful [&#8230;]not quicklynching someone who&#8217;s at least critically thinking.&#8221; These two thoughts don&#8217;t match up, explain. Why did you vote Fitz here? And wouldn&#8217;t you be an easy target at this point based on how thick you were being? If Fitz was scum you would sure be a juicy mislynch target at this point. Do you have examples of Randomidget being mislynch bait? So your question in #107 is what scum motivation could Randomidget have in his actions, correct? He could be white knighting a townie for cred, he could be soft defending a buddy with meta tells that he could easily explain away later. Those two things seem like decent scum motivation for his current actions. #113 Dat Food scum tell. In #120 you try to explain why you voted Slandaar over kelbris, but you use a post that you made before you realized that Slandaar was joking with his post. Now that you know that Slandaar was mocking Kelbris wouldn&#8217;t that change anything.</div> I probably should have checked the replace list first, goddamnit.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Randomidget</div>- I&#8217;ve heard of you, all good things. What is the &#8220;this&#8221; that you feel Kelbris does as town? When you made that statement Kelbris had all of one post. Do you have enough history with them to get a solid read off an intro post? #95 &#8220;He has a habit of explaining himself and posting weird semi-relevant stuff.&#8221; He made one post. You don&#8217;t think that he could make that same one post as scum? (I know that he has made more posts by the time you explain this a bit, but your read is based off his first post alone) #138 naked vote on Massive, why?<br>\n<br>\nSeriously the whole Kelbris/Slandaar/Burn/Cheet circle jerk made me want to smash my head into my keyboard. I would also like explinations about where peoples heads were at with their naked votes on Slandaar. So that&#8217;d be Randomidget and Kelbris.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Viking</div>- How do you come in at post #36 and have nothing to say about what had been going on previously? How do you differentiate between scum and newbtown? What does it take to get a scum read for you? Your list had 5 town reads, 3 null reads, 3 nothings, and one possible scum.  <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Hodor</div>- How does someone saying that they normally get scumread for certain behavior stop people from scumreading them based off those tells? I have played with too many people who pull the whole &#8220;Woe is me&#8230; I always get scumread for doing X&#8221; schtick and it gets old quickly. If you do something that gets your scumread all the time change it or figure out a way to discern what alignment people are that are reading your that way.

Ok, so Aris replaced Cheet, Oka replaced Hodor, and Saul replaced Flames. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Why hasn&#8217;t it been updated to show I replaced Riblet?</div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Kelbris</div>- Why are you so sure Slandaar is scum? I have seen him play before and I am getting the same vibe here. A town one if that wasn&#8217;t clear. #196 is almost a carbon copy of an earlier post of yours, and its still wrong. Flavor claiming is very different from role claiming. And you are still wrong about the claim helping town in the slightest. What don&#8217;t you get about being a VT? You are canon fodder, pawns, grunts to be slain in glorious battle when your time comes. VTs are put in place to take kills that could otherwise be used on PRs. The greatest gift a VT can give to the town is their death in the night. Are you going to scum hunt at any point by the way? #203 you go more in depth with Fakegods claim. He flavor claimed to try and clear himself as town. That is very different than role claiming. And I have seen games where the main character in the flavor used is not in the game. Its called a red herring. I find it disconcerting that the only strong read you seem to have is on Slandaar. Look at the amount of thought you put into that read, its equal to the entire rest of the field. Do you not think that there is much else out there other than evidence you have found against Slandaar? &#8220;I did not ignore it, I just did not feel that it warranted a response.&#8221; <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_facepalm.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":facepalm:\" title=\"Face, Meet Palm\">  Jesus man. #256 You don&#8217;t think his attitude could have anything to do with the fact that both of the player you are talking about missed a pretty big part of what Slandaar was doing? Cheet and Burn both saw something that wasn&#8217;t there and posted at length about it. Hell Cheet acted so aloof about the whole situation that it pissed me off for Slandaar.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Rando</div>- In post #155 you say Cheet is town. Cheet seems townie. Why the repetition and the wishy washyness? Who the fuck are you to say who people should be voting? Especially with 11+ days left in this phase. It&#8217;s not like you are in thread making a case and pushing an agenda. You are mostly MIA and when you do pop in you come up with the fact that there might be mafia in the game. Your insight is absolutely staggering. #245 You reiterate that Kelbris is being scumread for things he does as town. Can you please outline exactly what you mean by this. You have been asked this question before by multiple people and apparently refuse to answer. The game you won, was the player you pressured seasoned or new? How exactly did you win on day 2 from that info?<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Aris</div>- I kinda disagree that just because someone replaces out it should erase any read you had on that slot. If I scum read Cheet, which I kinda was, then I am going to be looking at you with a much more skeptical eye. If I was voting Cheet I would still be voting you. It seems like Viking wanted something from Flame, which he said as much, and what better way to make sure that you get that from the replacement than by voting that slot. It seems like someone replacing in would be paying a lot more attention to whoever was voting them. <div style=\"display:inline-flex;text-decoration:line-through\">FA_Q2 makes a good point on the weekend vla, why is what you said different from what Kelbris said?</div> Nevermind. Do you think that Kelbris could have seen it done by town in a game, and decided that he (as scum) might be able to get away with the same thing?<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Slandaar</div>- I am not going to be able to help suss out your little tet-a-tet with Riblet, all I can say is that I don&#8217;t see the same things that he apparently did. I have seen you play before, once in person and a few times in random games of yours I&#8217;ve read. I am willing to give you a bit of latitude in your play because when you are on you are good, and when you aren&#8217;t you&#8217;re still pretty alright. Also, if your play follows anything like I&#8217;ve seen previously, you will probably do something to get yourself lynched anyways  <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\"> <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Burn</div>- What would Kelbris have to do to gain a scumread from you? Newb =/= scum, dumb =/= scum, so what would? How much scummery does one have to commit before being seen as scum?<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">FA_Q2</div>- I don&#8217;t know where Riblets head was at on his read, I can&#8217;t follow his logic. I don&#8217;t see what he was seeing, and have a town read on Slandaar. I think this could easily be a situation where Riblet thought he had a legit read on Slandaar and tunneled in on it.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Viking</div>- What the fuck are you going on about with Massive and the replacements? <br>\nAnd Sauls vote in #259 is horibad.

In regards to the town:vikingfan question, I don't really know why he would not read it, perhaps he did but simply forgot to bring it up until now.  He was in the game from the start so we can't say he missed it because he replaced in.<br>\n<br>\n@OkaPoka I am REALLY interested in hearing how you being lynched would get Monkey lynched then me lynched, that does not seem like something I would say as town.

If you were town you would not WANT such a chain, as it could prove detrimental to the town's efforts, think about it, we have 13 players, if there are no town vigilantes or SKs, here is how the game COULD go.<br>\nday 1: you lynched<br>\nnight 1: randomidget NKed (assuming he is town)<br>\nday 2: Monkey lynched<br>\nnight 2: *insert random town player here* NKed<br>\nday 3: I am lynched<br>\nnight 3: *insert another random town player here*<br>\n<br>\nif this happens and all 3 are town and there are 3 scum players which could happen, that would mean that we could wind up in a state of MyLo OR if we get it right, be in LyLo 2 days later or MyLo again the next day depending on the number of scum, in other words, not a very good idea for town to do.</div></blockquote><br>\nMy strategy is a BASIC OUTLINE or a guide.

His lynch could be very informative. He has made a lot of posts and it feels like he has been one of the major focuses of this game.

My apologies (seems like this is happening to half the game, sadly, judging from everyone else's responses.  but my sincere apologies for vanishing.

Not much more to it than that.  Remember, I pretty much had to discard half the early game because of replacements.

It's not nitpicking to me if Slandaar and riblet are both attacking each other line by line post by post.  That's a debate.  That said, it's also a debate most of the town got tired pretty quickly.<br>\nWicked-if I'd known that post of mine would have gotten that much attention, I never would have made it.

We eliminate outing any PRs day one (always a plus in my book), and as wicked says, he's not a power role.  I'm honestly not sure how much information we'd get though but it would be something to work off for day 2.<br>\nAristophanes seems way too 'let everyone else do the work for me'.

What about the link you provided to a recent Fish game indicates he is scum in this game?  If you have a smoking gun...great.  But at first glance I do not see one.<br>\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\nOK...less than 3 days left and I for one know I will not be around late Friday night for last second vote shifting.<br>\n <br>\nI've made my preferences clear...Random (3 votes), kelbris (1 vote) and OkaPoka (3 votes).  Of those three the two with the most steam appear to be Random and OkaPoka, so I would suggest voters to vector towards them.  Not sure if there is enough interest (sadly) in kelbris.  <br>\n <br>\nI think the current votes on massive (by Saul) and Monkey (by Oka) are a waste.  I do not recall any significant suspicions towards either of them.  So Saul and Oka should move to a different wagon.  <br>\n <br>\nWith Fish v/LA the kelbris vote might remaining hanging there so if Saul or Oka move that way it could become a contender again.  The Fish and viking wagons are middle of the pact possibilities but not sure they have the interest to make a lynch.<br>\n <br>\nHere are my thoughts on D1 lynches.  We obviously do not want a no lynch...the day has gone too long to end like that.  We need a flip to 1) nail scum, 2) get some reads from known alignments (i.e. the D1 lynch + whatever N1 brings) or 3) if we  wind up with a mislynch- hopefully rid town of someone who brings nothing to the game.<br>\n <br>\nRight now I like Random because I think he would satisfy 1-3 (same for kelbris).

I just don't think any of the points brought up against him are very telling, I think he'd be at least trying to appear pro-town if he was scum.

The sacrificial-acceptance post is pretty null, don't fall for it. Oka started playing that card first.

Not familiar with his play, but I tend to believe in <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">his</div> recent game-over/okay-with-own-lynch mentality. Admittedly, I think that's the only reason I had for town reading him, but it's a decently-strong feeling.

Sorry, not happening. Kelbris lynch would have been satisfactory, but Monkey was much scummier. <br>\n<br>\nSecondly, I promised that I would switch my vote if there wasn't any Monkey support by a particular time. I would never let the game go to no-lynch, especially on day 1. I understand that this game is in desperate need of information, I would never cast a vote that I feel lacks potential. <br>\n<br>\nThirdly, I think it's very rare for a game to go no-lynch on day 1 by accident. I believe we had <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">26 hours, not 18</div> at the time I casted my vote for Monkey. It's not difficult to create a bandwagon in that amount of time. <br>\n<br>\nFourthly, small other correction: FA voted Monkey 15 minutes after I posted my case. Not before or at the same time. I don't think it's a coincidence that FA voted Monkey around the time I made my case.  <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":roll:\" title=\"Rolling Eyes\">", "time": "Fri Apr 03, 2015 11:16 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=61056&start=500", "forum": "53", "thread": "61056"}

(i.e. I'm busy + it's a pita).<br>\n<br>\nMoving my vote to Monkey vice Oka wasn't too difficult for me.   Oka was at the tail end of my preferred three suspects yesterday and looking at the wagons...I did not want to be on the same wagon as my top two suspects when there was a wagon that had 2-3 of my stronger town reads on it.<br>\n<br>\nDo I think kelbris, random Idgit and Oka are the scum team?  No.  I think I said as much one or two posts ago.  I'm hopeful that at least 2 of them are scum but I could envision only 1 being scum and the other scum being in the middle and higher tiers of my town reads.  I'd rather work on the low hanging suspects first though and let the more difficult ones weed themselves out as the numbers grow smaller.    <br>\n<br>\nAs for today...I'm debating between random Idgit and Oka.  kelbris is starting to fall behind them a bit imo.  I still do not like his game...and I do not look forward to him potentially being around in a lylo situation....but he's just been feeling less suspect than the other two in my mind.", "time": "Thu Apr 09, 2015 3:07 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=61056&start=525", "forum": "53", "thread": "61056"}

Other players are participating just as little, if not less so. What specifically makes it worse that Oka is doing it?<br>\n2. There are plenty of players who did bad scumhunting with regards to Kelbris, and I think everyone had their moment with Riblet (who Formerfish replaced). Even the Monkey stuff isn't that horrible (see [<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6710202#p6710202\" class=\"postlink\">http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.ph ... 2#p6710202</a>]392[/url]) and he's hardly the worst vote on the end-day bandwagon.<br>\n3. This is probably contradictory to Point 1. Is he posting no content, or content meant to look helpful?<br>\n<br>\nEven in your spoilered section, you brush over the discussion with Monkey. Oka isn't wrong in asking why FA gets a pass and random gets a townread, but he gets a scumread for essentially the same behavior.<br>\n<br>\nI guess here's the real question: If I put up your three points against FA or Randomidget, wouldn't they be just as legitimate?</div></blockquote><br>\nAlright, I just looked back at the two and I'll give you that Random is as bad, if not worse, than Oka. Perhaps I was a little gung-ho on this one.<br>\nFA seems like he's trying to be helpful a little more than these two though.<br>\n<br>\nOn point 3, I think they compliment each other. Lack of content while appearing busy with long-ass quotes while not saying much.</div></blockquote><br>\nI would disagree with the comparison between random and Oka being similar.  Random has absolutely zero contribution at all.  There is nothing there and he does not seem to give 2 shits about trying to play as town.  Oka on the other hand looks like he is trying to skate through and look like he is contributing while actually giving us nothing.  That gives me a slight scum read on Oka.  The problem is the lack of other candidates.  Who has really done anything scummy besides Oka?

You yourself specifically said it was all up to havingfitz to vote, havingfitz noted RL reasons why he had to hammer soon.  What exactly did you expect to happen?  When players reference R/L events, I tend to believe them unless given pressing reason otherwise and I haven't seen it this game.  also, you can specifiy that you're watiing for a claim when you unvote and people can take it as they will.  plus, a little later, you note that you wouldn't have believed a power role claim anyway so obviously a claim didn't matter to you at all.<br>\n<br>\nand I'm interested in hearing different people's reactions, especially since there's so little going on.<br>\n<br>\nAs for random, I'm not impressed by a vote with a promise of a case, I'll wait to see what your case is before I can rebut anything.", "time": "Sun Apr 19, 2015 3:34 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=61056&start=650", "forum": "53", "thread": "61056"}

There's no doubt in my mind that havingfitz's activity constraint was legitimate. Also, this game has been filled with mistakes and misreading - if I unvoted, I wouldn't trust everyone to understand that I was only doing it for havingfitz. Finally, it doesn't matter if I wouldn't have believed a claim (I'm pretty sure I admitted that after the hammer) - it's still good practice to claim before lynch - if Monkey had claimed something like tracker or vigilante, then it might have been worth it to keep him alive an extra day even if it seemed fake.

No. We let him shoot who he wants because he probably dies tonight. There is too much that can go wrong when you try to direct something like that. Scum gets more information than they should have and will make their night kill based off that info. If we give 2-3 choices they could try to pick who he would target to frame him when one kill comes out, there could be a role blocker on the scum team that would simply block Rando and frame him, or scum could just no kill to have only one flip tomorrow, then same boat for Rando. And with regards to picking those targets, scum would have a voice in the discussion and could just let Rando make the kill because they know it is going to be on town most likely (depending on the targets).

No. Do I think that we can successfully handcuff a vig to shoot? No. We let him shoot who he wants because he probably dies tonight. There is too much that can go wrong when you try to direct something like that. Scum gets more information than they should have and will make their night kill based off that info. If we give 2-3 choices they could try to pick who he would target to frame him when one kill comes out, there could be a role blocker on the scum team that would simply block Rando and frame him, or scum could just no kill to have only one flip tomorrow, then same boat for Rando. And with regards to picking those targets, scum would have a voice in the discussion and could just let Rando make the kill because they know it is going to be on town most likely (depending on the targets).

Vig is a beautiful safe claim because even if it gets cced you can fight to have the actual one lynched, saving the kill from being made, and then you can explain your own lack of kill away the next day.

Given his posting, I can't be sure that he would do it.</div></blockquote><br>\nI think, if he's a one shot vigilante, then he would shoot who we told him to, with the condition that he gets lynched otherwise. He's useless, but not rebellious. <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>vikingfan wrote:</cite>And then we're up a creek without a paddle because say he doesn't make the kill.  is it due to lack of activity or due to him being scum or ?</div></blockquote><br>\nIf there's no shot, then you don't have to worry about a mis-kill...  <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":roll:\" title=\"Rolling Eyes\"> The lack of a kill doesn't seem like a problem worth discussing right now- it sounds like tomorrow's business.</div></blockquote><br>\nNo, it is terrible for him to reveal the target because it directly allows them to manipulate the power.  <br>\n<br>\nThey can choose whether or not to roll block it based on the target or whether or not to kill him based on his target.  Essentially it would give the scum team the information they need to decide if role blocking is something they should do or are they going to get another dead townie out of it.<br>\n<br>\nIt is unlikely that he will end up taking out a scum &#8211; declaring it beforehand is almost like protecting scum from his ability.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nHow high in confidence do you know that there is a role blocker in this particular game? </div></blockquote><br>\nI can&#8217;t say anything in &#8216;high confidence&#8217; about the setup and I was quite clear about it in my statements.

Even at the risk of his ~vig shot being a miskill.  Unless there was a surefire way of knowing he was going to target scum there is no avoiding the chance his claimed shot results in a miskill.

It's the plan that was mentioned all day yesterday.  It's far more likely to use your logic, that scum had one of two goals.  Either frame you for the murder, if you're innocent, (Hey, Kop was supposed to be dead?  why didn't he die?  must be that either him or rando is scum!) or that you are scum and wanted to save yourself from getting killed.<br>\n<br>\nWho was actually targeted has pretty much nothing to do with it as who was targeted came out of left field and basically no one could foresee it.

So let's put the further logic to your plan, now the tables have turned, it should be you who is dead, not me, as Random has already said he shot you, so why should I die, if he mentioned he shot you? How would that frame me? <br>\n<br>\nNow there is one thing that is stinking about your post, and I will state this before I go on, lynch me if that will cure everybodies thoughts, and that will give everybody the answer to your part \"that you are scum and wanted to save yourself from getting killed\" that I am a VT, and I suggest they lynch you next.

Unfortunately, that's kind of shot out of the water because scum!FA could have just hopped onto the Oka wagon. By his first reads-list in 377, FA is certainly listing Monkey as one of his scumreads (along with Aristophanes); Oka is a null. That's consistent with his voting on the end-of-day wagons D1.<br>\n<br>\nBut by <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6768593#p6768593\" class=\"postlink\">620</a>, he's now doubting that Oka is town. Could be due to the competing wagons from D1? <br>\n<br>\nIt seems like my biggest problem is probably that he doesn't vote people that he finds suspicious. See 377, and then not moving onto Oka on D2 until he thought he was hammering. There's plenty of analysis but it seems vote-light. Especially since he was happy enough to vote for me for perceived lack of involvement.<br>\n<br>\nBut that's probably null at best.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Wickedestjr</div></div><br>\n<br>\nAgain, now with Oka confirmed town, it seems less likely that the Monkey wagon is to save Oka, which makes the whole play less suspicious.

In it you say you are using the same criteria others are using to suspect people: medium content levels and voting Monkey.  That seems like a pretty broad and ambiguous generalization of the reasons people have made their votes.  <br>\n <br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">How is medium content measured?  And is little or no content worse?<br>\n <br>\nHow many of the D2 votes people made were in part due to someone having voted Monkey?  And does the fact the D1 counterwagon ended up being town as well (Oka) affect the way people on the Monkey wagon are viewed?  And what about people who were on the D1 and D2 lynches?  I.e. me, Wicked and FA_Q2?</div>  Probably a pretty good chance at least one of us is scum one would think.  Yet you continue to focus on viking...and despite the fact you claimed you tried to kill him N2...you don't feel compelled to actually place a vote on him yet in D3.  <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":?\" title=\"Confused\"><br>\n <br>\nI will say this regarding your claim.  If it is true, and you had used it N1 on either of the last 2 people you had D1 votes on...we would more than likely have had 2 kills N1 and your claim of having a shot would have been proven (sk or vig...who knows).  if you had shot Oka that would have saved us his mislynch D2...and if you had shot viking who knows what that would have got us.  Instead...now you have claimed a failed N2 shot and are no more confirmed town than you were before you made the claim.  So you not killing N1 was a major fail.  Especially given that you were under a good bit of suspicions D1 and should have known you would receive a lot of heat D2.  Which also begs the fact you could have contrived the vig claim over N1 in anticipation (by you or more likely your scum partners) of needing a claim D2.<br>\n <br>\nSo...wrt the random claim...I can not see it being proven this game.  I doubt a doc would have wasted a protect on viking, and I doubt there would be a role offering viking some sort of immunity.  <br>\n <br>\nBased on my experience I would say the two most likely options for no 2nd kill N2 are: <br>\n <br>\n1) random idgit made a fakeclaim to save his hide or <br>\n2) mafia have a roleblocker.<br>\n<br>\nSo random is still my preferred lynch (for the 3rd day in a row).  Why?  <br>\n<br>\n<ul><li>- He could be scum.  He's been a consensus scum suspect who is only alive by virtue of his claim.  Of all the players left in the game; wicked and Kop are the only two who haven't voted random at some point.<br>\n- He could be the one who is bulletproof.  A bulletproof SK is not that uncommon and he would be crazy not to claim vig if put at L-1.<br>\n- He could be town telling the truth.  But how will we ever know?  Even if he is town telling the truth...he apparently can not prove it and his play to this point in the game makes him a town terrible option for a LYLO situation.  If scum do have a RB they aren't going to waste a kill on random and will just keep preventing him from proving his claim.</li></ul><br>\n <br>\nIn all three of the above scenarios random idgit is a liabilty and town is better/stronger without him.

It's the plan that was mentioned all day yesterday.  It's far more likely to use your logic, that scum had one of two goals.  Either frame you for the murder, if you're innocent, (Hey, Kop was supposed to be dead?  why didn't he die?  must be that either him or rando is scum!) or that you are scum and wanted to save yourself from getting killed.<br>\n<br>\nWho was actually targeted has pretty much nothing to do with it as who was targeted came out of left field and basically no one could foresee it.  And this all assumes rando is telling the truth.  If he's scum, then this has a far easier solution.  Is there a reason why you're not willing to consider this solution, Kop?</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nYeah I know what the old plan was, but welcome to the new one. <br>\n<br>\nAnd I can see the logic behind what you said about 'hey I was supposed to be dead', that would have been there plan had Random not come out, and STATE who he shot. So let's put the further logic to your plan, now the tables have turned, it should be you who is dead, not me, as Random has already said he shot you, so why should I die, if he mentioned he shot you? How would that frame me? <br>\n<br>\nNow there is one thing that is stinking about your post, and I will state this before I go on, lynch me if that will cure everybodies thoughts, and that will give everybody the answer to your part \"that you are scum and wanted to save yourself from getting killed\" that I am a VT, and I suggest they lynch you next. Back to the post, this is striking me, a lot more than it has been, this is scum defending corners, he has got the shot roleblocked and he is going to be at the forefront of defending it all, trying to look pro town and trying to put FOS onto someone.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nI don't think you understand where I'm coming from.  Let me explain it again.  The reason I am talking about the way things were supposed to be is that scum was operating under the assumption that is what was going to happen.  Town was operating under that assumption.  Therefore, you have to ask, what would have been the outcome under your idea of a mafia roleblocker?  Either rando would be perceived as being guilty for lack of a kill or you would be because rando was going to shoot you and you wanted to stay alive.  The reason why it doesn't matter in my case is simply this:  nobody could have foreseen rando picking me.  let me put it this way:  would you be voting wicked if rando claimed he had shot wicked?  havingfitz?  aristo?  I doubt it.<br>\n<br>\nMore to the point, I don't like how you are tunneling onto one possible hypothesis for this without even considering the much more likely scenario of rando lying.  Your certainty that we have a mafia roleblocker seems to indicate at inside knowledge only scum would have.  I prefer to remain open to all options.  And you need to remember, we are investigating the assumptions on what people were operating under last night to indicate some idea of the reasons behind their actions.", "time": "Tue May 05, 2015 12:45 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=61056&start=900", "forum": "53", "thread": "61056"}

Why?  Do you find random suspect?  And if your opinion towards random is no different today than it was D1 and D2...why bemoan the fact that his wagon is not getting traction while you yourself or not voting him?  As for votecount analysis...I'm a huge proponent of votecount analysis but this game has not been good for that.  D1 everyone was pushing for Monkey or Oka...and they were lynched in that order.

Now that his kill failed, he is still trying to explain his missing kill as being due to a mafia roleblocker (except, how do we know one is in the setup?)  It's much easier for me to believe that he simply lied about his claim and thus the missing kill is self-explanatory.  Pretty much everyone hated his play day 1 and 2 and even with his more involved play now, it's not really helping him that much.  That being said, if he's scum, he's also got buddies.

I'll be honest, I don't know if rando is scum or not, but this is blatantly anti-town behavior.  Guess this is another of the 1 million things you forgot to post and is totally untrustworthy at this point (if we can't trust him as town on this, can we trust him as town on anything?).  And I never saw a part 2 of the case on me either like you promised along with a lot of other things.  But since randoscum probably has scum buddies, I will evaluate other candidates.

I'm letting people know what I'm thinking.  I'm announcing that IMO, random is pretty much cleared (GOOD).  And before wicked decided to answer for someone else...I was engaging random in questions about his night actions (GOOD).  WHICH...from memory...he seemed to have stated both that he did and that he did not have a shot remaining.  So how is clarifying that a bad thing (IT'S NOT)?  I disagree that it was \"extremely unhelpful.\" And how is trying to wrap one's brain around the lack of a NK a bad thing?  Something could still come of it but it was really just my writing down my thoughts as I was thinking them.  <br>\n <br>\naka my stream of consciousness.  <br>\n <br>\nSpeaking of which....that is what I was doing when I read through viking.  I looked at each of his posts and gave my initial reaction to them (if one was warranted).  Having not been on my radar the entire game...he deserved a closer look.  And I did find some questionable things in his posting but not enough to overcome what I was seeing from random.<br>\n<br>\nSpeaking of which....my post on random was not a line by line ISO read like I did on viking.  It was an ISO read on myself trying to summarize the things I had found suspect towards random.  And having spent most of the 1st two days trying to get random lynched...I did not feel the need to do a read through similar to the one I did on viking because I was more in tune with my opinion of random's play.  So my viking readthrough and my random summary WOULD look completely different.  I said I would be summarizing...you call it cherrypicking.

You keep trying to tie in my suspcions towards random with other's suspicions towards viking.  viking was never a target of mine so there would not be a reason to stop from \"still pushing rando.\"  I explained this just yesterday and you said <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6880428#p6880428\">it made sense.</a> <br>\n <br>\nAnd not voting someone I do not suspect is not \"avoiding like the plague.\"  Was I avoiding the Kop wagon \"like the plague?\"  Are you a graduate of the same negative spin school as Aristo?  Do you think it was not obvious viking was lining up to be the lynch yesterday?  It was to me.  Why, as town OR scum, would I avoid jumping on it?  Why as scum would I stay as the lone vote on what is most likely town random when I could have bussed/lynched scum viking for town cred or brought Kop to L-1 as well...and either supported a mislynch there or strived for town cred depending on Kop's alignment?  FYI...to avoid a no lynch I would have hammered viking (or Kop if he'd been at L-1).<br>\n <br>\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\n <br>\nPre-readthrough reads:<br>\nTown: wicked and random<br>\nSlightly less town: Fish and massive<br>\nSuspect group: FA_Q2, Aristo, Kop</div></blockquote><br>\nIt made a bit of sense when we had no flip.

Nothing happened, which means a protection/block of sorts, or that scum nokilled. That's all we know from the night.<br>\nThe whole thing about Random not using his shot does not help in the least since he had no shot and announced so. We all assumed he had no shot anyway, no? I did, because that's not sitemeta and he assumed from an offsite game that is merely similar to Mafia.

It was an ISO read on myself trying to summarize the things I had found suspect towards random. And having spent most of the 1st two days trying to get random lynched...I did not feel the need to do a read through similar to the one I did on viking because I was more in tune with my opinion of random's play. So my viking readthrough and my random summary WOULD look completely different. I said I would be summarizing...you call it cherrypicking.

No, this is wrong. I was never interested in hammer voting specifically. I was interested in your general bussing history.

If they have 2 decent PRs town could conceivably have 4 PRs......so bleh. <br>\n<br>\nOn that note....given random did flip town Vig...and viking was just normal scum....we should assume scum have a roleblocker.  So a scum RB + a scum ___ could = 4 town PRs (maaaaaaaaybe????????).  The other thing I do not like regarding massive's claim (aside from the 4 PR thing) is the fact he allowed random to go unprotected N4.  Why protect someone (Aristo) who could conceivably be scum?  If you had a strong enough read on wicked to protect him N1 and N2, and finally presumably earned a save with a N3 protect on random...which in your mind (along with the viking flip) should have locktight guaranteed he was town...why stray off random N4 or not go back to wicked?  And scum...if they thought there was a doc could have just as easily targeted you (or wicked).  So why leave confirmed town from your POV unprotected and protect a question mark when 1) you could have been protecting scum, 2) you could have brought us to D5 with 1 rock solid confirmed town. <br>\n<br>\nSo if massive is given a pass today that would leave 1-2 scum amongst Fish-Aristo-Kop. <br>\n<br>\nOn fence about massive.  Of the remaining three I have the most suspicion towards Aristo.  Though Kop's presence (or lack of) the last few days has been bothersome.   <br>\n<br>\nI'll try to get some more posting in tonight.   <br>\n<br>\nAlso, though probably not v/LA worthy, it's worth noting I will be doing an overnight hike this weekend and I expect I'll have little or no internet access until Monday.

<br>\n<ul><li>Two I know are town (me and Wicked).<br>\nOne I have read as town the entire game (fish).<br>\nThat leaves 3.&#160; <br>\nOne has claimed Doctor (need to chew that over more).<br>\nThat leaves Aritso and Kop.<br>\n</li></ul><br>\nKop at various times I have had suspicions towards (can't recall if I voiced them or not).<br>\nAristo on the other hand had pinged my scumdar a few times with some of the votes he has made.&#160; So having scum narrowed down to 2 out of 4 for me makes it a 50% chance that Aristo is scum.&#160; A 66% chance if I am right on Fish and a 100% chance if massive is telling the truth.<br>\n<br>\nSo the unvote is because I need to consider massive more closely.&#160; 100% certainty is an easy vote to make but since a mislynch today ends the game (even if massive is telling the truth)...a less than certain vote needs more thought.<br>\n<br>\nBut back to Aristo....the VCA bits that have me thinking he could be scum are:<br>\n<br>\nD2 I thought his Oka hammer was odd (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6814677#p6814677\">\"Okie Dokie?\"</a>)...that it came from nowhere.&#160; Though he did vote him earlier in D2 he hopped over to random once the Oka wagon initially started to lose steam.&#160; Actually bringing random to L-1 twice and forcing a claim from random which didn't deter Arito from voting him regardless.&#160; And for a brief stint he was on Kop which could result in having just been some light bussing.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nD3 he was voteless for most of the day.&#160; And while viking was gaining steam as the day's lynch, Aritso avoided the viking wagon and tried to work a Kop lynch.&#160; If Kop is in fact scum...this could have been a very subtle bus that could have paid out big if the tide had turned and Kop had been lynched (and scum).&#160; As it was...he did not support the eventual scum lynch.&#160; I also think his comments to viking in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6885459#p6885459\">Post 1069</a> in hindsight looked like scum daychat.<br>\n<br>\nSpeaking of the viking wagon...I believe there was at least one scum on it.&#160; I think if neither of viking scum mates were on his wagon he would have been more likley to self vote at the end.&#160; Once he flipped scum I thought it was odd that he allowed himself to be at L-1 as long as he did without muddying the water by hammering himself.&#160; I think he was allowing his teammate/s to get cred for his demise.<br>\n<br>\nD4 he and massive supported the FA mislynch and are the only two on it still alive who aren't confirmed town (fmpov).<br>\n<br>\nNothing VCA related yet today.<br>\n<br>\n******************************************************<br>\n<br>\nI feel like I am talking myself in and out of suspecting people the more I read.&#160;<br>\n<br>\nI do see the points Wicked brings up against massive.&#160;

By continuing to present my suspicions towards random throughout D3 and trying to get him lynched.  To say I was defending anyone else because I was being consistently on who I DID and HAD suspect is IMO a misrep.  Was I soft defending Kop as well?  Absurd.  Maybe I was soft defending wicked and fish as well since I didn't go after them?  The only reason I even paid viking the attention I did on D3 was because he was looking like the day's lynch and I wanted to see if that was something I could support (and someone may have asked me...idr).

I made it clear that POE was enough reasoning for me, I have no reason to \"work very hard to shoehorn a case\" against you. It doesn't matter how the case starts, if I find better reasons then I will use them. And you're crazy if you think I'm not going to have issue with you lying. You never once said \"Oops, my bad, I was wrong\", you're continuing to defend your blatant lies and make me look like a misrepresenter. That's because you received a mafia role pm which told you that your objective is to avoid getting lynched.<br>\n<br>\nYou're trying to make it seem like I'm on a mission to get you lynched, but keep in mind: I clearly said that I would townread you if you were telling the truth about the meta.

And if a doctor saved me (regular, oneshot, or otherwise), don't out yourself please, you'll be marked for death by scum right away and I'd rather keep our PRs in the dark.  In any case, assuming idget is telling the truth about being a one-shot vig, his shot is used up now so he's useless.  But if he's scum, then the lack of a second kill makes sense.

Let me explain it again.  The reason I am talking about the way things were supposed to be is that scum was operating under the assumption that is what was going to happen.  Town was operating under that assumption.  Therefore, you have to ask, what would have been the outcome under your idea of a mafia roleblocker?  Either rando would be perceived as being guilty for lack of a kill or you would be because rando was going to shoot you and you wanted to stay alive.  The reason why it doesn't matter in my case is simply this:  nobody could have foreseen rando picking me.  let me put it this way:  would you be voting wicked if rando claimed he had shot wicked?  havingfitz?  aristo?  I doubt it.<br>\n<br>\nMore to the point, I don't like how you are tunneling onto one possible hypothesis for this without even considering the much more likely scenario of rando lying.  Your certainty that we have a mafia roleblocker seems to indicate at inside knowledge only scum would have.  I prefer to remain open to all options.  And you need to remember, we are investigating the assumptions on what people were operating under last night to indicate some idea of the reasons behind their actions.</div></blockquote><br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6839674#p6839674\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6839674#p6839674\" data-post-id=\"6839674\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 954</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=733\">vikingfan</a> wrote:</cite>lol the only reason I'm at L-2 is because 3 people are voting me and one only because of pressure, I've seen no actual indication from any other player that they're interested in voting me so I think you're barking up the wrong tree.<br>\n<br>\nThat said, it also seems like random isn't getting any traction either so it may be time for us to start branching off to other prospects, much as I don't like rando's play.

It's not just that he \"voted a scum buddy in another game\" it's that he voted for only town until it was clear he was going to get lynched, and then he cast a throwaway vote for a partner.

This makes a lot more sense coming from Formerfishtown that preferred a Kop lynch and genuinely believed that viking was town. <br>\n<br>\nhavingfitz is also town for asking if random shot last night.

He then, when voting Kop, said \"well if we can't lynch Random, this is a good alternative.\" (Obvious paraphrasing here) even though Random was. It's almost like he wanted someone else to stert the counterwagon so he could blend in on it more easily.<br>\nAnd I still read his question about me being the real push behind handcuffing Random both a big leap and unfounded.

He went post by post to make him look as \"meh\" as possible. He made it hard to follow and asked almost no questions. His verdict after it was \"well, Random is still a better lynch.\"<br>\nNow look at his Random one. The language is damning. He makes it easy to follow, strings things together, provides links and asks stuff. It looks to me like he was trying really hard to get a case anywhere but on Viking.<br>\nHe also wrote it up 20 posts or so after Random confirmed his lack of shot.<br>\nIf he had actually looked at Random rather than simply trying to demonize him, he would have noticed it.
