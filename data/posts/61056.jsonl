You may not quote private Moderator-supplied information (either real or fabricated) of any kind. Paraphrasing (for role claims, etc.) is acceptable.<br>2. There is to be NO personal communication outside of the forum postings unless your role PM specifically allows it. Mafia members may communicate at night and during the confirmation stage.<br>3. If you have a role with a Night action your choices are due to me by the posted deadline. If I do not receive your choice via PM or bolded in the quick-topic provided by the posted deadline you will forfeit your actions.<br>4. Roles with Night actions will not be able to submit an action on Night 0 (i.e. during the confirmation stage).<br>5. Any player with a Night action may instead submit a \u201cNo Action\u201d PM to let the Mod know that you do not want to perform your expected action that Night phase.<br>6. As a general rule you should aim for one post every 48 hours, minimum, to keep the game moving.<br><br>Voting, Deadlines, and Player Death:<br>1. A simple majority of all living members must agree on one person for a lynch to occur prior to deadline.<br>2. Once you have reached a simple majority no further unvoting will change someone\u2019s fate.<br>3. Once a player is lynched the game enters twilight until I post a death scene; all players including the one who was lynched may continue to post during twilight.<br>4. Please submit votes as: Vote: PlayerName or VOTE: PlayerName. Votes will NOT be counted if they are not bold! Obvious abbreviations or nicknames will be counted so long as they are unambiguous.<br>5. Please submit vote revocations as either Unvote: PlayerName or Unvote. Unvotes are not necessary before changing votes.<br>6. You may Vote: No Lynch - a simple majority of these vote types are required to send the game to Night phase without a lynch.<br>7. This game will have 3 week deadlines. At deadline, if there is not a simple majority of votes there will be No Lynch.<br><br>Miscellaneous/Mechanics:<br>1. Bold, blue text is reserved for the Mod. No invisible/small text is allowed, nor is cryptography.<br>2. If you have an issue/problem with the game, please PM the Mod privately. Do not post issues/complaints in the game thread.<br>3. The Mod may make mistakes - please point out any mistakes gently. Mistakes will be corrected where possible, but sometimes mistakes are made that cannot be reversed. These will stand as final to be commiserated over after the game.<br>4. Please bold all requests to the Mod so that they don\u2019t get missed.<br>5. Prods of missing players will be issued automatically after 72 hours of no activity or upon request after 48 hours of no activity. A prodded player has 48 hours to respond or risks replacement. A player who has been prodded 3 times is subject to replacement without further notice.<br>6. Rule violations will be dealt with according to their severity, up to and including a Modkill.<br>7. If you anticipate being unavailable for more than a 48-hour period please post a notice to that effect in the thread. Treat this game as a commitment. Be considerate \u2013 don\u2019t leave us hanging.<br><br>Here is the Role PM for a Vanilla Townie, at least one person has received this PM.<br><br>Vanilla Townie<br>Welcome, you are a Vanilla Townie.<br>Abilities:<br>Your weapon is your vote, you have no night actions.<br>Win condition:<br>You win when all threats to the town have been eliminated and there is at least one town player alive.<br>You can find the game thread here: _______<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #0000FF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Please confirm your role via PM<br>The game will open once 10 players have confirmed.</span></span></span>"}

However your post didnt specify one or the other and I think that kelbris living in a weird timezone, causing him to not be on at the same time as us, is an actual explanation as to why people would think he is lurking.  Where as Slandaar saying I might not be on because I have other shit to do isnt an explanation as far as Im concerned.  So because the word \"explain\" was used I thought we were talking about kelbris"}

I will now refute your reasons for claiming;<br>-Claiming just because people suspect you is bad. You were not at risk of getting lynched. The best way of removing suspicion is by defending yourself and scum hunting. You claimed VT, but that doesn\u2019t make it more likely that you are town. You could very easily be scum lying. <br>-You said that your claim removes targets for the vigilante, but that is not true. The hypothetical vigilante has no reason to believe that you are VT rather than scum. Your claim actually makes it more likely that a vig kills you because they know you are not a town power role. <br>-You said that your claim removes targets for the doctor. But this is also not a good reason - if you were suspected enough that you felt the need to claim, then the hypothetical doc wasn\u2019t going to protect you anyway. Doctors generally protect players that are not suspected by others. <br>-You said that your claim removes targets for the cop, but this is also not true. Claiming VT does not confirm you as town because you could very easily be mafia lying. You are just as good an investigation choice as you were before. <br><br>Your claim does not make it easier for any town power roles. But if you are town, then it does make it easier for scum.

This was in open #586 (don't worry, it IS over).<br><br>The reason I voted for Slandaar is because he intended to use a post which has no bearing on a player's alignment or role (my first one of the game), as a reaction test, a pointless one at that because said post contained NOTHING alignment-indicative and was merely an explanatory post as to any delay in my posting, the \"other things\" part was because I am busy during the day most of the time, meaning I only post in the mornings/nights some days and was intended to be a blanket term for such things.<br><br>I would also like to say that in my experience, I HAVE seen someone claim in their first post, although that claim was a character not a role (might as well have been one since it more-or-less revealed their role, VT), it would have had the same affect as mine.  IMO it either reduced scum's possible options or made them want to target him more, in this case it was the former since we never bothered to touch him until later in the game.  Surprisingly, he did not suffer the same amount of backlash as I did when I attempted the same technique."}

Second of all, I came to the conclusion that Slandaar's post was trying to gauge reactions was after he revealed that he was imitating me, if you look at the posts between #9 and #21 (when he imitated me and when he revealed it respectively), you will see burn_209's vote for him (if this was an RVS vote please feel free to correct me), Cheetory6's vote on him because of his same post, Slandarr's subsequent question as to why they were voting for him and not me, along with a short conversation between Cheetory6 and Wickedest about my first post, later on Cheetory revealed that he was referring to Slandaar all that time NOT my post.<br><br>After reading back through thoes relevant posts, I started thinking that he was trying to see exactly HOW other players would react to such a post, whilst mine came off as newbie explaining everything, a quick look at Slandaar's profile revealed that he has been around for 3 years more then me, reaffirming my opinion that his post was to gauge other player's reactions.  I also noticed that he lives in a timezone which allows him to be online at the same time that other players are.  Which made me ask, if he lived in such a time zone, WHY would he make such a post if not to try to get people to react so he can determine whether they are scum or town.  I voted for him, because I knew that his post was a (pretty poor excuse for a) reaction test OR that he was lying to give himself an excuse to lurk, something that scum are probably more likely to do then town, (I did not mention the lying part earlier because it had not dawned on me that it could have been the case until after I had gone offline for the day)."}

If you need clarification on these suspicions lemme know.  You may note that being easy targets wasn't one of my reasons.  As for your opinion that they are they easiest targets....that's pretty subjective (at least at   4 pages into the game IMO).  Whether or not any of the suspicions I have voiced correspond to \"metatells\" I do not know and do not care.  Having not played with either kelbris or idget...I do not know what their habits are and I do not know or care if they are easy lynches.  You also make note of ignoring your \"dumbfuck\" handling of Slandaar and his wagon.  Is that part of your reason for voting me as well? <br><br>As for my point about you criticizing Slandaar for useless posting while at the same time applauding him for critical thinking...we'll just have to disagree.

That's what idget did and is part of the reason I am voting him.   Why are you trying to make explanations on idget's behalf to defend his 1-post based town read on kelbris?  What does lazy or not have to do with anything?  And at the point I placed my vote on him...low content wasn't a factor.  Since my vote....his low output (~disappearance) and the quality of his body of posts has become more obvious and not done him any favors. <br><br>If any of this in unclear...lemme know.

His posts don't really contain much if any scum hunting, he shows no signs of trying to progress the game and he has dodged questions and still dodging questions.

And how would we determine the times where you are otherwise occupied or lurking? #65 ::facepalm::. Just ::facepalm::. Everything anyone said about how bad a decision you made is 100% correct, Wicked put it best though in #79. What makes you think that Slandaars post was a reaction test? How do you know it is a pointless one unless you understand what information he could possibly get from it? Your premise for believing that Slandaar was running a reaction test that early is flawed. Burn and Cheet both misunderstood something that Slandaar thought was self evident. Jesus Christ, it seems like he was making fun of you, that\u2019s how I took it.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Slandaar</span>- I got the joke man, not sure how so many people were clueless about it. Do you think that was dumbassery or scum trying to jump on something little and missing something bigger?<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Burn</span>- Did you feel the breeze when Slandaars joke flew over your head? Post #24 I need to make sure you didn\u2019t mess up here \u201cIn fact I cant remember the last time I was in a game and we lynched someone because of inactivity and that person flipped town\u201d because your first statement sounds like you think scum doesn\u2019t lurk much, but the quoted one sounds like you lynch accurately off activity.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">FA_Q2</span>- Do you find something scummy about voting for a wagon? Is everyone\u2019s funny bones busted in this game? People are missing super obvious jests at people and taking it as scummy.  Why did you avoid any of the votes that could have started a wagon? Have you played with Massive before? He will carry his weight, just worry about yourself for the time being and everything will be dandy. Decent questions to Cheet, you get some town points. You do seem to lack the ability to accurately identify OMGUS though. Massive simply looked at your iso to see if you were one to walk the walk or just talk the talk, he appears to have weighed and measured you and you have been found wanting.<br><br><strike><span class=\"noboldsig\">Cheetory</span>- I really hope to see you improve as the game goes, I have read like the first 5 pages and am disappointed in your play so far. I am going to try to not discuss much of the misunderstanding because I saw that it gets cleared by around page 5, but Jesus man that whole line of investigation was all sorts of bad. I am having a hard time believing you didn\u2019t get the joke because it was so apparent to me on my first read through that Slandaar was being facetious. Even in the face of people telling you that you are reading it wrong you kept it up for far longer than you should have. I wonder if this is a case of \u201cscum sticking with a stupid read for longer than scum should, so he must be town\u201d bullshit that most people believe. Also, I do find it funny you tell someone to retrace your thought process, but are unable to do so yourself. I hope you feel like kind of a dick for #31. I love when people are overly dickish because they think they understand something that others have missed and feel superior for it.  #88 \u201cWeps. I'm officially being shit this game. Sorry.\u201d Admitting you have a problem is the first step in recovery. We are here for you Cheet. \u201cSlandaar might be scum for how hard he\u2019s trying to seem like he\u2019s doing something useful [\u2026]not quicklynching someone who\u2019s at least critically thinking.\u201d These two thoughts don\u2019t match up, explain. Why did you vote Fitz here? And wouldn\u2019t you be an easy target at this point based on how thick you were being? If Fitz was scum you would sure be a juicy mislynch target at this point. Do you have examples of Randomidget being mislynch bait? So your question in #107 is what scum motivation could Randomidget have in his actions, correct? He could be white knighting a townie for cred, he could be soft defending a buddy with meta tells that he could easily explain away later. Those two things seem like decent scum motivation for his current actions. #113 Dat Food scum tell. In #120 you try to explain why you voted Slandaar over kelbris, but you use a post that you made before you realized that Slandaar was joking with his post. Now that you know that Slandaar was mocking Kelbris wouldn\u2019t that change anything.</strike> I probably should have checked the replace list first, goddamnit.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Randomidget</span>- I\u2019ve heard of you, all good things. What is the \u201cthis\u201d that you feel Kelbris does as town? When you made that statement Kelbris had all of one post. Do you have enough history with them to get a solid read off an intro post? #95 \u201cHe has a habit of explaining himself and posting weird semi-relevant stuff.\u201d He made one post. You don\u2019t think that he could make that same one post as scum? (I know that he has made more posts by the time you explain this a bit, but your read is based off his first post alone) #138 naked vote on Massive, why?<br><br>Seriously the whole Kelbris/Slandaar/Burn/Cheet circle jerk made me want to smash my head into my keyboard. I would also like explinations about where peoples heads were at with their naked votes on Slandaar. So that\u2019d be Randomidget and Kelbris.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Viking</span>- How do you come in at post #36 and have nothing to say about what had been going on previously? How do you differentiate between scum and newbtown? What does it take to get a scum read for you? Your list had 5 town reads, 3 null reads, 3 nothings, and one possible scum.  <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Hodor</span>- How does someone saying that they normally get scumread for certain behavior stop people from scumreading them based off those tells? I have played with too many people who pull the whole \u201cWoe is me\u2026 I always get scumread for doing X\u201d schtick and it gets old quickly. If you do something that gets your scumread all the time change it or figure out a way to discern what alignment people are that are reading your that way. Saying I always get scumread for lurking does nothing to clear up alignment, any indication that you think it does should be banished to the land of bad fucking ideas.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Fitz</span>- Get out of my head man, everytime I pull something to comment on, I find you making the same post a few later on. I don\u2019t see how Cheets replace is being seen as town, in fact I always have a hard time figuring out how anyone can see alignment in a replace out. Can you try to shed some light on this for me? I was scum reading Cheet and kinda see the same in his replace.<br><br>I stopped on Page 6. Finish tomorrow."}

I have seen him play before and I am getting the same vibe here. A town one if that wasn\u2019t clear. #196 is almost a carbon copy of an earlier post of yours, and its still wrong. Flavor claiming is very different from role claiming. And you are still wrong about the claim helping town in the slightest. What don\u2019t you get about being a VT? You are canon fodder, pawns, grunts to be slain in glorious battle when your time comes. VTs are put in place to take kills that could otherwise be used on PRs. The greatest gift a VT can give to the town is their death in the night. Are you going to scum hunt at any point by the way? #203 you go more in depth with Fakegods claim. He flavor claimed to try and clear himself as town. That is very different than role claiming. And I have seen games where the main character in the flavor used is not in the game. Its called a red herring. I find it disconcerting that the only strong read you seem to have is on Slandaar. Look at the amount of thought you put into that read, its equal to the entire rest of the field. Do you not think that there is much else out there other than evidence you have found against Slandaar? \u201cI did not ignore it, I just did not feel that it warranted a response.\u201d <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_facepalm.gif\" alt=\":facepalm:\" title=\"Face, Meet Palm\">  Jesus man. #256 You don\u2019t think his attitude could have anything to do with the fact that both of the player you are talking about missed a pretty big part of what Slandaar was doing? Cheet and Burn both saw something that wasn\u2019t there and posted at length about it. Hell Cheet acted so aloof about the whole situation that it pissed me off for Slandaar.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Rando</span>- In post #155 you say Cheet is town. Cheet seems townie. Why the repetition and the wishy washyness? Who the fuck are you to say who people should be voting? Especially with 11+ days left in this phase. It\u2019s not like you are in thread making a case and pushing an agenda. You are mostly MIA and when you do pop in you come up with the fact that there might be mafia in the game. Your insight is absolutely staggering. #245 You reiterate that Kelbris is being scumread for things he does as town. Can you please outline exactly what you mean by this. You have been asked this question before by multiple people and apparently refuse to answer. The game you won, was the player you pressured seasoned or new? How exactly did you win on day 2 from that info?<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Aris</span>- I kinda disagree that just because someone replaces out it should erase any read you had on that slot. If I scum read Cheet, which I kinda was, then I am going to be looking at you with a much more skeptical eye. If I was voting Cheet I would still be voting you. It seems like Viking wanted something from Flame, which he said as much, and what better way to make sure that you get that from the replacement than by voting that slot. It seems like someone replacing in would be paying a lot more attention to whoever was voting them. <strike>FA_Q2 makes a good point on the weekend vla, why is what you said different from what Kelbris said?</strike> Nevermind. Do you think that Kelbris could have seen it done by town in a game, and decided that he (as scum) might be able to get away with the same thing?<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Slandaar</span>- I am not going to be able to help suss out your little tet-a-tet with Riblet, all I can say is that I don\u2019t see the same things that he apparently did. I have seen you play before, once in person and a few times in random games of yours I\u2019ve read. I am willing to give you a bit of latitude in your play because when you are on you are good, and when you aren\u2019t you\u2019re still pretty alright. Also, if your play follows anything like I\u2019ve seen previously, you will probably do something to get yourself lynched anyways  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\"> <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Burn</span>- What would Kelbris have to do to gain a scumread from you? Newb =/= scum, dumb =/= scum, so what would? How much scummery does one have to commit before being seen as scum?<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">FA_Q2</span>- I don\u2019t know where Riblets head was at on his read, I can\u2019t follow his logic. I don\u2019t see what he was seeing, and have a town read on Slandaar. I think this could easily be a situation where Riblet thought he had a legit read on Slandaar and tunneled in on it.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Viking</span>- What the fuck are you going on about with Massive and the replacements? <br>And Sauls vote in #259 is horibad. Its bad because the whole idea is based off the false premise that Massive forgot who replaced who. The vote on Oka had nothing to do with the post above it."}

For some reason my continued back and forth with Cheeto had me leaning a bit town towards him top being with and then his replaceout seemed to fit more from town than scum.  I do not see scum getting bored and bailing when they aren't under any pressure/close to being lynched.  I would see scum as more invested in the game even if it was going slow.  That's just a better situation for scum to stay in.

He even admitted that he didn't know Flames' motivation, as scum, to act the way that he did. Also, I have a hard time believing he missed the 'randomidget thinks kelbris is town' discussion - his vote for random seems opportunistic. <br><br>kelbris- A close second. He is still scummy for his weird Slandaar vote and explanations before/after. This lynch also has two key benefits: a.) He has claimed VT already. Lynching kelbris removes the opportunity for other roles to be outed. There's a good chance he's scum, but, even if he isn't, the loss is small because he's not a power role. b.) His lynch could be very informative. He has made a lot of posts and it feels like he has been one of the major focuses of this game. One of the primary goals of day 1 is to get information and I think his lynch gets it, regardless of the flip. <br><br>Oka- I currently town read Oka, but that town read is very weak. The lynch-chain post feels like a town tell, but I realize that that could be the intention behind it. I'm certain of the fact that Oka's lynch would be very informative. In particular, I think Oka's flip could help us read massive and Monkey - I see possibilities of bussing there, if Oka flips scum. <br><br>Monkey- His play so far has felt off for reasons I've explained. <br><br><br>Aristophanes should cast a vote- think for yourself please. Saul, Slandaar, and Oka should probably vote elsewhere."}

My apologies (seems like this is happening to half the game, sadly, judging from everyone else's responses.  but my sincere apologies for vanishing.  Truth be told, the main reason I'm staying in is to eliminate ika looking for yet another replacement and I don't want to do that to ika.<br><br>No, I didn't miss the randomidget discussion, it's just what struck me most upon a reread.  Not much more to it than that.  Remember, I pretty much had to discard half the early game because of replacements.  That was one of hte few things that came to me that I could actually do something with as compared to 'well, I can't ask so and so about this post because they're gone'.<br><br>As for posts that stand out to me since the last time I posted:<br><br>Saul, that post that former made doesn't stand out much to me either way.  It's an easy post for either town or scum to make so to me it's a null tell.<br>Aristophanes, I concur with Slandaar.  It's not nitpicking to me if Slandaar and riblet are both attacking each other line by line post by post.  That's a debate.  That said, it's also a debate most of the town got tired pretty quickly.<br>Wicked-if I'd known that post of mine would have gotten that much attention, I never would have made it.  I probably should have done a FOS instead and it was way too early in the game considering his relatively little posting.<br><br>As for my lynch list in no particular order:<br>Though I've been leaning Kelbris = newbtown, I do agree with wicked that POLICYWISE, he is the best lynch for day one.  We eliminate outing any PRs day one (always a plus in my book), and as wicked says, he's not a power role.  I'm honestly not sure how much information we'd get though but it would be something to work off for day 2.<br>Aristophanes seems way too 'let everyone else do the work for me'.  I don't like those kind of players and ESPECIALLY not in the endgame.  All it takes is one very assertive scum  to hold sway over Aristo and we've lost.  Everyone else is busy too- I am, wicked is, etc.  We still do our own thinking.  It also leans to me like 'if I'm scum, then I don't want to risk incriminating myself.'<br>Ditto, FA is not a replacement.  Monkey, what are you talking about?  it's right there in page one.<br>random is still the same."}

Of those three the two with the most steam appear to be Random and OkaPoka, so I would suggest voters to vector towards them.  Not sure if there is enough interest (sadly) in kelbris.  <br> <br>I think the current votes on massive (by Saul) and Monkey (by Oka) are a waste.  I do not recall any significant suspicions towards either of them.  So Saul and Oka should move to a different wagon.  <br> <br>With Fish v/LA the kelbris vote might remaining hanging there so if Saul or Oka move that way it could become a contender again.  The Fish and viking wagons are middle of the pact possibilities but not sure they have the interest to make a lynch.<br> <br>Here are my thoughts on D1 lynches.  We obviously do not want a no lynch...the day has gone too long to end like that.  We need a flip to 1) nail scum, 2) get some reads from known alignments (i.e. the D1 lynch + whatever N1 brings) or 3) if we  wind up with a mislynch- hopefully rid town of someone who brings nothing to the game.<br> <br>Right now I like Random because I think he would satisfy 1-3 (same for kelbris).

I just don't think any of the points brought up against him are very telling, I think he'd be at least trying to appear pro-town if he was scum.

The sacrificial-acceptance post is pretty null, don't fall for it. Oka started playing that card first.

Sorry, not happening. Kelbris lynch would have been satisfactory, but Monkey was much scummier. <br><br>Secondly, I promised that I would switch my vote if there wasn't any Monkey support by a particular time. I would never let the game go to no-lynch, especially on day 1. I understand that this game is in desperate need of information, I would never cast a vote that I feel lacks potential. <br><br>Thirdly, I think it's very rare for a game to go no-lynch on day 1 by accident. I believe we had <span class=\"noboldsig\">26 hours, not 18</span> at the time I casted my vote for Monkey. It's not difficult to create a bandwagon in that amount of time. <br><br>Fourthly, small other correction: FA voted Monkey 15 minutes after I posted my case. Not before or at the same time. I don't think it's a coincidence that FA voted Monkey around the time I made my case.  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif\" alt=\":roll:\" title=\"Rolling Eyes\">"}

No.  I think I said as much one or two posts ago.

Well, I appreciate having a scumpool, but does that mean you should push cases on them based on what I (for one) see as being not even close to enough for a case?

You yourself specifically said it was all up to havingfitz to vote, havingfitz noted RL reasons why he had to hammer soon.  What exactly did you expect to happen?  When players reference R/L events, I tend to believe them unless given pressing reason otherwise and I haven't seen it this game.  also, you can specifiy that you're watiing for a claim when you unvote and people can take it as they will.  plus, a little later, you note that you wouldn't have believed a power role claim anyway so obviously a claim didn't matter to you at all.<br><br>and I'm interested in hearing different people's reactions, especially since there's so little going on.<br><br>As for random, I'm not impressed by a vote with a promise of a case, I'll wait to see what your case is before I can rebut anything."}

When players reference R/L events, I tend to believe them unless given pressing reason otherwise and I haven't seen it this game. also, you can specifiy that you're watiing for a claim when you unvote and people can take it as they will. plus, a little later, you note that you wouldn't have believed a power role claim anyway so obviously a claim didn't matter to you at all.</div></blockquote><br>If havingfitz needed to hammer prematurely, then I would have expected him to say who he was planning to vote - then somebody with more time on their hands could unvote until the claim came. There's no doubt in my mind that havingfitz's activity constraint was legitimate. Also, this game has been filled with mistakes and misreading - if I unvoted, I wouldn't trust everyone to understand that I was only doing it for havingfitz. Finally, it doesn't matter if I wouldn't have believed a claim (I'm pretty sure I admitted that after the hammer) - it's still good practice to claim before lynch - if Monkey had claimed something like tracker or vigilante, then it might have been worth it to keep him alive an extra day even if it seemed fake. I also don't want this town getting in the habit of hammering pre-claim...<br><br>But I'm not sure why you're still questioning me on this.

No. We let him shoot who he wants because he probably dies tonight. There is too much that can go wrong when you try to direct something like that. Scum gets more information than they should have and will make their night kill based off that info. If we give 2-3 choices they could try to pick who he would target to frame him when one kill comes out, there could be a role blocker on the scum team that would simply block Rando and frame him, or scum could just no kill to have only one flip tomorrow, then same boat for Rando. And with regards to picking those targets, scum would have a voice in the discussion and could just let Rando make the kill because they know it is going to be on town most likely (depending on the targets). So this has nothing to do with trust and everything to do with not wanting scum to get anymore information out of us.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6799947#p6799947\" class=\"postlink\">post 754</a>, massive wrote:</cite>Kop replaced Kelbris.

Keep in mind the whole idea of him being handcuffed is predicated upon him being town. If you don't think that is true it will become more evident soon. Vig is a beautiful safe claim because even if it gets cced you can fight to have the actual one lynched, saving the kill from being made, and then you can explain your own lack of kill away the next day. We didn't get a cc here, so there is a 50/50 chance he is lying, if he isn't though we could use the kill we'd just have to cross our fingers on it hitting correctly."}

No. Do I think that we can successfully handcuff a vig to shoot? No. We let him shoot who he wants because he probably dies tonight. There is too much that can go wrong when you try to direct something like that. Scum gets more information than they should have and will make their night kill based off that info. If we give 2-3 choices they could try to pick who he would target to frame him when one kill comes out, there could be a role blocker on the scum team that would simply block Rando and frame him, or scum could just no kill to have only one flip tomorrow, then same boat for Rando. And with regards to picking those targets, scum would have a voice in the discussion and could just let Rando make the kill because they know it is going to be on town most likely (depending on the targets). So this has nothing to do with trust and everything to do with not wanting scum to get anymore information out of us.</span><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6799947#p6799947\" class=\"postlink\">post 754</a>, massive wrote:</cite>Kop replaced Kelbris.

Vig is a beautiful safe claim because even if it gets cced you can fight to have the actual one lynched, saving the kill from being made, and then you can explain your own lack of kill away the next day. We didn't get a cc here, so there is a 50/50 chance he is lying, if he isn't though we could use the kill we'd just have to cross our fingers on it hitting correctly.</span></div></blockquote><br><br>I can see why you would have missed it, I fucked the quote tag somehow and my response to viking was included in his quote.

It\u2019s actually \u201cslightly better\u201d. In one scenario, random kills a town PR. In the other scenario, the town PR is outed but they either survive or are killed by scum instead of by a vig.

You say it\u2019s easier for scum to convince one guy than it is for scum to convince a majority. But you ignore the fact that it\u2019s also easier for town to convince one guy than it is for town to convince a majority.

It's the plan that was mentioned all day yesterday.  It's far more likely to use your logic, that scum had one of two goals.  Either frame you for the murder, if you're innocent, (Hey, Kop was supposed to be dead?  why didn't he die?  must be that either him or rando is scum!) or that you are scum and wanted to save yourself from getting killed.<br><br>Who was actually targeted has pretty much nothing to do with it as who was targeted came out of left field and basically no one could foresee it.  And this all assumes rando is telling the truth.  If he's scum, then this has a far easier solution.  Is there a reason why you're not willing to consider this solution, Kop?</div></blockquote><br><br>Yeah I know what the old plan was, but welcome to the new one. <br><br>And I can see the logic behind what you said about 'hey I was supposed to be dead', that would have been there plan had Random not come out, and STATE who he shot. So let's put the further logic to your plan, now the tables have turned, it should be you who is dead, not me, as Random has already said he shot you, so why should I die, if he mentioned he shot you? How would that frame me? <br><br>Now there is one thing that is stinking about your post, and I will state this before I go on, lynch me if that will cure everybodies thoughts, and that will give everybody the answer to your part \"that you are scum and wanted to save yourself from getting killed\" that I am a VT, and I suggest they lynch you next. Back to the post, this is striking me, a lot more than it has been, this is scum defending corners, he has got the shot roleblocked and he is going to be at the forefront of defending it all, trying to look pro town and trying to put FOS onto someone."}

Unfortunately, that's kind of shot out of the water because scum!FA could have just hopped onto the Oka wagon. By his first reads-list in 377, FA is certainly listing Monkey as one of his scumreads (along with Aristophanes); Oka is a null. That's consistent with his voting on the end-of-day wagons D1.<br><br>But by <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6768593#p6768593\" class=\"postlink\">620</a>, he's now doubting that Oka is town.

You answer questions from him even.

In it you say you are using the same criteria others are using to suspect people: medium content levels and voting Monkey.  That seems like a pretty broad and ambiguous generalization of the reasons people have made their votes.  <br> <br><span class=\"noboldsig\">How is medium content measured?  And is little or no content worse?<br> <br>How many of the D2 votes people made were in part due to someone having voted Monkey?  And does the fact the D1 counterwagon ended up being town as well (Oka) affect the way people on the Monkey wagon are viewed?  And what about people who were on the D1 and D2 lynches?  I.e. me, Wicked and FA_Q2?</span>  Probably a pretty good chance at least one of us is scum one would think.  Yet you continue to focus on viking...and despite the fact you claimed you tried to kill him N2...you don't feel compelled to actually place a vote on him yet in D3.  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif\" alt=\":?\" title=\"Confused\"><br> <br>I will say this regarding your claim.  If it is true, and you had used it N1 on either of the last 2 people you had D1 votes on...we would more than likely have had 2 kills N1 and your claim of having a shot would have been proven (sk or vig...who knows).  if you had shot Oka that would have saved us his mislynch D2...and if you had shot viking who knows what that would have got us.  Instead...now you have claimed a failed N2 shot and are no more confirmed town than you were before you made the claim.  So you not killing N1 was a major fail.  Especially given that you were under a good bit of suspicions D1 and should have known you would receive a lot of heat D2.  Which also begs the fact you could have contrived the vig claim over N1 in anticipation (by you or more likely your scum partners) of needing a claim D2.<br> <br>So...wrt the random claim...I can not see it being proven this game.  I doubt a doc would have wasted a protect on viking, and I doubt there would be a role offering viking some sort of immunity.  <br> <br>Based on my experience I would say the two most likely options for no 2nd kill N2 are: <br> <br>1) random idgit made a fakeclaim to save his hide or <br>2) mafia have a roleblocker.<br><br>So random is still my preferred lynch (for the 3rd day in a row).  Why?  <br><br><ul>- He could be scum.  He's been a consensus scum suspect who is only alive by virtue of his claim.  Of all the players left in the game; wicked and Kop are the only two who haven't voted random at some point.<br>- He could be the one who is bulletproof.  A bulletproof SK is not that uncommon and he would be crazy not to claim vig if put at L-1.<br>- He could be town telling the truth.  But how will we ever know?  Even if he is town telling the truth...he apparently can not prove it and his play to this point in the game makes him a town terrible option for a LYLO situation.  If scum do have a RB they aren't going to waste a kill on random and will just keep preventing him from proving his claim.</ul> <br>In all three of the above scenarios random idgit is a liabilty and town is better/stronger without him.  With a huge bonus if he turns out to be an anti-town role.<br> <br><span class=\"noboldsig\">tl;dr</span><br> <br>This is our last chance to get rid of random without being in an auto-loss situation if he is town.  <br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: randomidgit</span><br><br>I also need to stop focusing so much on random and working on a top three list.

It's the plan that was mentioned all day yesterday.  It's far more likely to use your logic, that scum had one of two goals.  Either frame you for the murder, if you're innocent, (Hey, Kop was supposed to be dead?  why didn't he die?  must be that either him or rando is scum!) or that you are scum and wanted to save yourself from getting killed.<br><br>Who was actually targeted has pretty much nothing to do with it as who was targeted came out of left field and basically no one could foresee it.  And this all assumes rando is telling the truth.  If he's scum, then this has a far easier solution.  Is there a reason why you're not willing to consider this solution, Kop?</div></blockquote><br><br>Yeah I know what the old plan was, but welcome to the new one. <br><br>And I can see the logic behind what you said about 'hey I was supposed to be dead', that would have been there plan had Random not come out, and STATE who he shot. So let's put the further logic to your plan, now the tables have turned, it should be you who is dead, not me, as Random has already said he shot you, so why should I die, if he mentioned he shot you? How would that frame me? <br><br>Now there is one thing that is stinking about your post, and I will state this before I go on, lynch me if that will cure everybodies thoughts, and that will give everybody the answer to your part \"that you are scum and wanted to save yourself from getting killed\" that I am a VT, and I suggest they lynch you next. Back to the post, this is striking me, a lot more than it has been, this is scum defending corners, he has got the shot roleblocked and he is going to be at the forefront of defending it all, trying to look pro town and trying to put FOS onto someone.</div></blockquote><br><br>I don't think you understand where I'm coming from.  Let me explain it again.  The reason I am talking about the way things were supposed to be is that scum was operating under the assumption that is what was going to happen.  Town was operating under that assumption.  Therefore, you have to ask, what would have been the outcome under your idea of a mafia roleblocker?  Either rando would be perceived as being guilty for lack of a kill or you would be because rando was going to shoot you and you wanted to stay alive.  The reason why it doesn't matter in my case is simply this:  nobody could have foreseen rando picking me.  let me put it this way:  would you be voting wicked if rando claimed he had shot wicked?  havingfitz?  aristo?  I doubt it.<br><br>More to the point, I don't like how you are tunneling onto one possible hypothesis for this without even considering the much more likely scenario of rando lying.  Your certainty that we have a mafia roleblocker seems to indicate at inside knowledge only scum would have.  I prefer to remain open to all options.  And you need to remember, we are investigating the assumptions on what people were operating under last night to indicate some idea of the reasons behind their actions."}

When players reference R/L events, I tend to believe them unless given pressing reason otherwise and I haven't seen it this game.  also, you can specifiy that you're watiing for a claim when you unvote and people can take it as they will.  plus, a little later, you note that you wouldn't have believed a power role claim anyway so obviously a claim didn't matter to you at all.<br><br>and I'm interested in hearing different people's reactions, especially since there's so little going on.<br><br>As for random, I'm not impressed by a vote with a promise of a case, I'll wait to see what your case is before I can rebut anything.</div></blockquote><br>Now attacks the other person suspecting him.<br>Part two tomorrow.</div></blockquote><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">lol I was responding, not attacking.

The only reason a slot matters when it has changed players is when the slot is a PR or is confirmed town or scum.  In hindsight the Saul/EPM slot is neither (hindsight also being where random's comments are made).  So no...there is no reason to assume random is talking about the slot.  <br><br>Here are the last two comments made wrt Saul:<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6826935#p6826935\" class=\"postlink\">post 907</a>, randomidget wrote:</cite>I am interested in the NK. Was it to frame me or because Saul was onnthe right track.</div></blockquote><br>So massive...are you saying random was actually saying Saul's SLOT was on the right track?  Duh.  No...EPM was the nk and we do not know (iirc) where his opinions were.  Whether or not Saul was on the right track or not had no relevance to EPM being NK'd.   Understand?<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6832293#p6832293\" class=\"postlink\">post 920</a>, randomidget wrote:</cite>If I was scum why would we shoot Saul. If I was scum I would've claimed I shot Saul and mafia didn't shoot to frame me.</div></blockquote><br>This coooould be pertaining to the slot since random had earlier made this comment:<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6708300#p6708300\" class=\"postlink\">post 320</a>, randomidget wrote:</cite>Saul Goode - town</div></blockquote>...but why would scum kill someone they were painting as scum?  They would not which makes the possibility of random being scum even more plausible.  But to my point...Saul wasn't the one who was focking NK'd.  EPM was.  I know they are the same slot but they aren't the same player and at least in the case of the first Saul comment....random's comments have nothing to do with the SLOT.  And if his second comment pertains to the SLOT...it supports the possibility of random being scum.  <br><br>So what is so hard about a player having their shit straight and saying the name of the right player. <br><br>And I'm not trying on purpose to be confusing as you imply.  I'm trying to keep things straight.  <br><br>And Fish...wtf with the facepalm?  Do you not understand my clarifications?"}

Even if he is town telling the truth...he apparently can not prove it and his play to this point in the game makes him a town terrible option for a LYLO situation.  If scum do have a RB they aren't going to waste a kill on random and will just keep preventing him from proving his claim.</ul> <br><span class=\"noboldsig\">In all three of the above scenarios random idgit is a liabilty and town is better/stronger without him.  With a huge bonus if he turns out to be an anti-town role.</span></div></blockquote><br>I disagree with the bolded. If random is SK, then he is an awful lynch because there is likely a mafia role blocker role-blocking him every night anyway. If random is town, then we absolutely can\u2019t afford to mislynch him because it means seven-man lylo tomorrow which is super tricky.<br><br>And there\u2019s little evidence for him being mafia."}

I can think of no reason to purposely substitute Saul for EPM so I can only assume random Idgit was confused.  And assuming random Idgit WAS confused...and really thought Saul was the NK...that would support the possibility of random Idgit being scum because 1) random had stated they though Saul was town and typically scum get rid of threats and townreads in that order...and 2) Saul was among the many advocates of a random Idgit lynch (9i.e. the threat bit).

It's much easier for me to believe that he simply lied about his claim and thus the missing kill is self-explanatory.  Pretty much everyone hated his play day 1 and 2 and even with his more involved play now, it's not really helping him that much.  That being said, if he's scum, he's also got buddies.

If you want to go back and look, clearly and repeatedly, rando has not been involved.  When called on various things, he has said repeatedly, 'I forgot to post that' or 'I thought I said that'.  The last thing I wanted was for him to weasel out and say, 'I forgot' AGAIN.  Heck, even a statement, 'yes, I am going to shoot tonight' would have sufficed.  SOMETHING to show that yes, he is involved and playing the game.

The real difference here is not that you were concerned IF he was going to shoot (to potentially determine whether he was lying about his role) but WHO he was going to shoot.

It might not change your mind but it could at least strengthen the scum read that you already had. If town, a replacement could also yield a scum hunter that puts more effort in."}

I looked at each of his posts and gave my initial reaction to them (if one was warranted).  Having not been on my radar the entire game...he deserved a closer look.  And I did find some questionable things in his posting but not enough to overcome what I was seeing from random.<br><br>Speaking of which....my post on random was not a line by line ISO read like I did on viking.  It was an ISO read on myself trying to summarize the things I had found suspect towards random.  And having spent most of the 1st two days trying to get random lynched...I did not feel the need to do a read through similar to the one I did on viking because I was more in tune with my opinion of random's play.  So my viking readthrough and my random summary WOULD look completely different.  I said I would be summarizing...you call it cherrypicking.  Nice negative spin where none is deserved.<br> <br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br> <br><span class=\"noboldsig\">@FA_Q2...</span>how are my suspicions towards random \"contrived as hell?\"  I would make the same assessment of your suspiscions towards me.  You keep trying to tie in my suspcions towards random with other's suspicions towards viking.  viking was never a target of mine so there would not be a reason to stop from \"still pushing rando.\"  I explained this just yesterday and you said <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6880428#p6880428\">it made sense.</a> <br> <br>And not voting someone I do not suspect is not \"avoiding like the plague.\"  Was I avoiding the Kop wagon \"like the plague?\"  Are you a graduate of the same negative spin school as Aristo?  Do you think it was not obvious viking was lining up to be the lynch yesterday?  It was to me.  Why, as town OR scum, would I avoid jumping on it?  Why as scum would I stay as the lone vote on what is most likely town random when I could have bussed/lynched scum viking for town cred or brought Kop to L-1 as well...and either supported a mislynch there or strived for town cred depending on Kop's alignment?  FYI...to avoid a no lynch I would have hammered viking (or Kop if he'd been at L-1).<br> <br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br> <br>Pre-readthrough reads:<br>Town: wicked and random<br>Slightly less town: Fish and massive<br>Suspect group: FA_Q2, Aristo, Kop</div></blockquote><br>It made a bit of sense when we had no flip. Now we know that viking is scum and it makes a LOT more sense that you were trying to push an alternative wagon.<br><br>I explained why your reasons were as contrived as hell yesterday.  You never adequately dealt with that.  The only reason that I moved on from your wagon is that it was getting nowhere and it would not have served town's interest to be on a wagon that would have more likely created a no-lynch scenario and viking was another good scum candidate."}

No, this is wrong. I was never interested in hammer voting specifically. I was interested in your general bussing history.

I just wanted to know if you had ever voted for a scum buddy which is exactly what I said.

You should have been more specific when you said \"voted to lynch\" because it doesn't immediately imply hammering. \"Hammering\" is one word and easier to write out than \"voted to lynch\", yet you chose to use the latter, more ambiguous phrasing.

I considered hiding behind massive or formerfish each night but hesitation about their alignments plus the chance they would be NK targets if town caused me to take a pass. <br><br>So wicked is confirmed town and there are two scum amongst Fish-Aristo-Kop-massive. <br><br>I'm finding it a little hard to believe town would have 4 PRs so I have some doubt about massive given his doc claim.  Just not sure if I want to push his lynch today on the chance I'm wrong.  Also...we don't know what the scum team has in terms of PR/s.  If they have 2 decent PRs town could conceivably have 4 PRs......so bleh. <br><br>On that note....given random did flip town Vig...and viking was just normal scum....we should assume scum have a roleblocker.  So a scum RB + a scum ___ could = 4 town PRs (maaaaaaaaybe????????).  The other thing I do not like regarding massive's claim (aside from the 4 PR thing) is the fact he allowed random to go unprotected N4.  Why protect someone (Aristo) who could conceivably be scum?  If you had a strong enough read on wicked to protect him N1 and N2, and finally presumably earned a save with a N3 protect on random...which in your mind (along with the viking flip) should have locktight guaranteed he was town...why stray off random N4 or not go back to wicked?  And scum...if they thought there was a doc could have just as easily targeted you (or wicked).  So why leave confirmed town from your POV unprotected and protect a question mark when 1) you could have been protecting scum, 2) you could have brought us to D5 with 1 rock solid confirmed town. <br><br>So if massive is given a pass today that would leave 1-2 scum amongst Fish-Aristo-Kop. <br><br>On fence about massive.  Of the remaining three I have the most suspicion towards Aristo.  Though Kop's presence (or lack of) the last few days has been bothersome.   <br><br>I'll try to get some more posting in tonight.   <br><br>Also, though probably not v/LA worthy, it's worth noting I will be doing an overnight hike this weekend and I expect I'll have little or no internet access until Monday.

The games that I have participated in over the time I have been here, I haven't seen the hider role used, once. So my current thought at the moment, is it a possibility that fitz is scum, chose hider as his role and picked out a name that isn't scum? Because I mean, scum obviously know who isn't on there team, and who isn't so choosing hider, you can select anybody in the game as he would know they are either town or 3rd party role. If they are 3rd party, they are hardly going to out themselves if it goes against there win con."}

more).<br>That leaves Aritso and Kop.<br></ul>Kop at various times I have had suspicions towards (can't recall if I voiced them or not).<br>Aristo on the other hand had pinged my scumdar a few times with some of the votes he has made.\u00a0 So having scum narrowed down to 2 out of 4 for me makes it a 50% chance that Aristo is scum.\u00a0 A 66% chance if I am right on Fish and a 100% chance if massive is telling the truth.<br><br>So the unvote is because I need to consider massive more closely.\u00a0 100% certainty is an easy vote to make but since a mislynch today ends the game (even if massive is telling the truth)...a less than certain vote needs more thought.<br><br>But back to Aristo....the VCA bits that have me thinking he could be scum are:<br><br>D2 I thought his Oka hammer was odd (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6814677#p6814677\">\"Okie Dokie?\"</a>)...that it came from nowhere.\u00a0 Though he did vote him earlier in D2 he hopped over to random once the Oka wagon initially started to lose steam.\u00a0 Actually bringing random to L-1 twice and forcing a claim from random which didn't deter Arito from voting him regardless.\u00a0 And for a brief stint he was on Kop which could result in having just been some light bussing.<br><br><br>D3 he was voteless for most of the day.\u00a0 And while viking was gaining steam as the day's lynch, Aritso avoided the viking wagon and tried to work a Kop lynch.\u00a0 If Kop is in fact scum...this could have been a very subtle bus that could have paid out big if the tide had turned and Kop had been lynched (and scum).\u00a0 As it was...he did not support the eventual scum lynch.\u00a0 I also think his comments to viking in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6885459#p6885459\">Post 1069</a> in hindsight looked like scum daychat.<br><br>Speaking of the viking wagon...I believe there was at least one scum on it.\u00a0 I think if neither of viking scum mates were on his wagon he would have been more likley to self vote at the end.\u00a0 Once he flipped scum I thought it was odd that he allowed himself

You're obviously working very hard to shoehorn a case onto me that you yourself claimed started due solely to POE.</div></blockquote><br>It started off as POE, there's nothing wrong with that. I made it clear that POE was enough reasoning for me, I have no reason to \"work very hard to shoehorn a case\" against you. It doesn't matter how the case starts, if I find better reasons then I will use them. And you're crazy if you think I'm not going to have issue with you lying. You never once said \"Oops, my bad, I was wrong\", you're continuing to defend your blatant lies and make me look like a misrepresenter. That's because you received a mafia role pm which told you that your objective is to avoid getting lynched.<br><br>You're trying to make it seem like I'm on a mission to get you lynched, but keep in mind: I clearly said that I would townread you if you were telling the truth about the meta.

There's a reason for that. I'm focusing more on you because a.) there is much more evidence that you are scum and b.) up until now, I wasn't sure who your partner would be. <br><br>massive, if you are town, you are one of the most unreasonable players I have ever met.

Let me explain it again.  The reason I am talking about the way things were supposed to be is that scum was operating under the assumption that is what was going to happen.  Town was operating under that assumption.  Therefore, you have to ask, what would have been the outcome under your idea of a mafia roleblocker?  Either rando would be perceived as being guilty for lack of a kill or you would be because rando was going to shoot you and you wanted to stay alive.  The reason why it doesn't matter in my case is simply this:  nobody could have foreseen rando picking me.  let me put it this way:  would you be voting wicked if rando claimed he had shot wicked?  havingfitz?  aristo?  I doubt it.<br><br>More to the point, I don't like how you are tunneling onto one possible hypothesis for this without even considering the much more likely scenario of rando lying.  Your certainty that we have a mafia roleblocker seems to indicate at inside knowledge only scum would have.  I prefer to remain open to all options.  And you need to remember, we are investigating the assumptions on what people were operating under last night to indicate some idea of the reasons behind their actions.</div></blockquote><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6839674#p6839674\" class=\"postlink\">post 954</a>, vikingfan wrote:</cite>lol the only reason I'm at L-2 is because 3 people are voting me and one only because of pressure, I've seen no actual indication from any other player that they're interested in voting me so I think you're barking up the wrong tree.<br><br>That said, it also seems like random isn't getting any traction either so it may be time for us to start branching off to other prospects, much as I don't like rando's play.

AND EVEN THEN, the lack of a kill wasn't even one of havingfitz's primary reasons for voting random. The day 3 random mislynch was not the low hanging fruit that you say it was. <br><br>899 is a huge leap considering people were telling him to shoot Kop and it feels more like Kop knows too much than that he genuinely figured it out. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>massive wrote:</cite>The problem is that it's more than simple bussing. Viking's vote at the end of D3 is a throwaway vote; if you want to meta and say \"well he voted a scumbuddy in another game,\" then kudos, but there's no other indication anywhere in the game that Vikingfan and Kelbris / Kop were buddies.</div></blockquote><br>You are exactly right about viking's vote being a throwaway vote! He knew it wouldn't lead to a lynch, a very safe time to bus... It wasn't just 'a vote for a scum buddy'. It was a last minute bus that he knew wouldn't work. It's not just that he \"voted a scum buddy in another game\" it's that he voted for only town until it was clear he was going to get lynched, and then he cast a throwaway vote for a partner. The voting patterns are exactly the same and you are painting an unfair broader picture of it all. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>massive wrote:</cite>If you want me to vote Kop, you're going to have to convince me that scum roleblocked Randomidget N2 and then decided that scum theater between Vikingfan and Kop was the play D3; and NOT to try and mislynch Randomidget.</div></blockquote><br>Lol, I don't care about convincing you. You're scum with him. I'm trying to convince Aristo and havingfitz.<br><br>Roleblocking randomidget was the ONLY choice that you could have made. random was obviously going to shoot vikingfan or Kop, both of whom are scum. <br><br>Scum theater between vikingfan and Kop is not expected, but it's perfectly normal if scum are smart/tricky. Scum have already shown their ability to be smart/tricky by killing evilpacman/Saul on night 2 - a completely bizarre night kill, when I was a more popular town read and I was repeatedly pushing for viking's lynch."}
