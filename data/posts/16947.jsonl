It is good to know who are first timers and who are veterans. Join date doesn't tell the whole story with alts and hiatuses.<br>\n3) How frequently can we be expecting you to post? Keep in mind the shorter deadlines.<br>\n<br>\n1) I live in PDT, which is something like GMT -8.<br>\n2) I have an increasing number of on-site games (not quite 20) and have played (mostly modded) a good handful of party style mafia.<br>\n3) I will keep up my usual high frequency of large posts.

A town player isn't allowed to be happy that main roles that help the town didn't get thrown out the window basically before the game really starts? Why would only a scum be concerned with this? Your quick reaction to vote me off a random vote and no serious allegations makes me curious what you are hiding that you need to shift focus on someone else who has only made their first post in the game.", "time": "Fri Mar 25, 2011 12:31 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=16947&start=25", "forum": "53", "thread": "16947"}

Its an old tell, which makes it less valuable, as most players avoid doing it, simply because its considered a tell.<br>\n<br>\nDRK seems to be extrapolating from there and defining a related tell, that I, at least, haven't heard before. He's claiming that you were congratulating luck on preventing an important kill.<br>\n<br>\nI can see some logic in this tell. A scum's natural reaction would to be disappointed that they hadn't managed to kill someone in the case of the doctor, or that they hadn't killed someone important, in this case. To mask that reaction, they might go so far in the opposite direction as to express happiness that things had gone well for the town.<br>\n<br>\nNow, just because its logical doesn't mean its accurate. I haven't seen it referenced before, but I haven't played in quite a while. I haven't noticed the behavior in scum myself, but I'd be interested in looking for it.<br>\n<br>\nDRK's other argument also makes some sense. You both answer the questions, and mention that the questions aren't helpful or necessary. Here you seem to be going out of your way not to rub either group the wrong way. If you think the questions aren't necessary, why answer them? If you don't mind answering them, why point out that they're unnecessary? It seems like your trying to agree with everyone, which is another possible scum tell.<br>\n<br>\nSo, Lucresia, I can see why DRK is voting for you.

What I'd like to add to the Lucresia argument is this:<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Lucresia wrote:</cite>You may not agree with a random vote but it doesn't make me scummy.</div></blockquote>\n\nNobody said it did. Defending against something that nobody ever accused you of in the first place reeks of paranoia, and does make you scummy.

I agree that RangeroftheNorth's #44 was an incredibly awkward post. To me it seemed like he was trying to imply that Erratus has made a gigantic scumslip, when he quite obviously hadn't. It's an especially weird post seeing as Ranger acknowledges that there's an alternative way to interpret that sentence which is quite obviously the right one in his post. I also don't like ICENinja voting Erratus for lying, when it was really really painfully obvious that Erratus was just joking. Accusing someone of 'lying' like that, especially when it's a joke and completely irrelevant is just such an easy argument for scum to construct. Same with 'you are acting slightly differently in this game then you are to another game'. People's behaviour changes over games for a multitude of different reasons, and again, pointing out 'contradictions' like this that are totally irrelevant is something that scum like to do from my experience.<br>\n<br>\nI really wish I could add more, but it seems like all my points have already been covered", "time": "Mon Mar 28, 2011 5:20 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=16947&start=75", "forum": "53", "thread": "16947"}

Did not like the bandwagon against me. Changed his vote to Ice Ninja beleiving his posts were more scummy based on supporting my bandwagon but keeping a bad vote on Erratus.<br>\n<br>\nlynchking - Posts this game = 1. Has only had one post the entire game which apologizes for lack of activity due to RL but promises to be more active. Agrees with DRK and Erratus' comments against me and jumps on the bandwagon. Despite his promise to be more active, it is now almost 2 full days later and hasn't provided any input to the game besides his jump on the bandwagon including his own feelings on any other player. Possibility of lurking scum although I can understand being busy as I too have had a very unexpected busy week. After the promise of activity without any follow through, I think he deserves an <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"> FOS: Lynchking</div>. This will however turn back to a vote if I don't see a more substantial post from him soon.<br>\n<br>\nICEninja - Posts this game = 18, (You will see a lot more information and notes on him just due to activity). Immediately draws everyone's attention to the day deadlines and requests everyone be very active. He maintains to be very active throughout the game having 18 posts overall. --consistency makes me lean towards town, however the next aspect I will discuss makes me think otherwise. <br>\n<br>\nHe asks everyone to answer a few questions that he wants just for his own personal knowledge, which I assume was also his way of starting conversation and activity. He also states he will be posting walls of texts. Brings up an old game and casts a vote on Erratus based on the questions ice asked. Although he says they weren't used to find scum, <div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">then contradicts himself </div> by saying someone was lying and that they must be scum based on the answer to a question that wasn't supposed supposedly being used to find scum in the first place.<br>\n<br>\nFeels the reasons DRK has for voting me are very sound. Then quotes my reasoning for answering the questions he had and beleives that I was trying too hard to look town in my post and considered joining my bandwagon. I find this interesting because again, the questions that were only for his knowledge are being used in a way to help him determine if someone is scum or not.<br>\n<br>\nMentions he also thinks Pine is trying to hard to not look like he is sheeping but does not feel it is enough to change his vote from Erratus.<br>\n<br>\nMentions that the activity in this game is low and brings up the following as people who haven't posted much or posted anything he feels is worthwhile: Valern, Trendall, Romanus, &amp; AMP. Does NOT mention LynchKing who hasnt even posted at all! Possible scum buddy? But wait, makes a post the next day after lynchking makes his first post and identifies all the obvious things Ive already stated in this post (1 post, jumps on bandwagon) and changes his vote to him. I wonder though how heartfelt this vote really is. I think that his response to romanus the next day might be <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">him </div> trying too hard to look like he isnt interested in my bandwagon nor still voting for erratus for no good reason. Then again as soon as I feel he might be scum, the next things he does seem town to me...he thinks valern has a bad mindset by wanting to just quick lynch me anyways (agreed btw...a quick lynch with barely any information is NOT a town mindset at all). He then confirms his previous posts throughout the game that he doesn't think anything Ive done or said yet is lynchworthy yet, just suspicious. Then decides after going back and forth a bit that Valern's bandwagon jumping You are a hard one to get a read on..that's for sure.<br>\n<br>\nTrendall -posts this game = 7, I beleive the low activity was only due to his V/LA. Brought up some good points concerning what he felt about my posts and my bandwagon. He also based off that was not entirely sure that I was the right choice.He pointed out a few things he didn't like while ommitting things that had already been covered *(I like this because it allows you to want to read his posts and not just skim since the content is fresh and there is actual thought provoking ideas to consider. He also brings rangerofthenorth into the picture who accussed trendall of being strongly behind my wagon and even for voting for me which never happened. Neither of those 2 things were true based on Trendall's posts. I am pretty confident Trendall is town.<br>\n<br>\nErratus Apathos - posts this game = 10, answered ICE's questions but the answer's were obviously sarcastic. Voted peabody for being \"nervous scum\" which he later explains why he thought he acted like nervous scum, good enough for a first vote. Then gave a bs answer to a bs accusation ICE had based on him \"lying \" which was really just him being sarcastic to his questions. Then just said he agreed with DRK's post and hopped on my bandwagon. Then he is thoroughly convinced that I am scum and keeps urging people to vote for me and hop on my bandwagon. Then after my claim, erratus agrees with Romanus that he does not think my post was a scum gambit and unvotes me to vote for ice ninja based on thinking that his \"lie\" is noteworthy. (a \"lie\" which still was just frickin sarcasm from a game that shouldnt have been brought up since its ongoing anyways and ice hasn't dropped it yet) . Either way I can't get a good read on him. <br>\n<br>\nRangeroftheNorth - posts this game = 13, answer's ICE's questions and discusses he prefers night 0's due to any information is better than none and more information = less chance of mafia manipulation. All these are fair statements. He then goes on to explain the congratulating the doctor tell and agrees with DRK's case on me. Then hops on the bandwagon. Then nitpicks and asks for clarification on something Erratus said. I think it was clear what Erratus meant, but perhaps ranger just wanted to post for the sake of posting? I can't imagine who really needed clarification on that statement..He then explains why he asked it but...it still seems strange to me. Regardless, strange doesnt necessarily mean scum. The rest of his posts are really saying that he finds me suspicious still but is not sure about me after my claim and unvotes. Then admits that re-reading trendall's posts he was far off on his analysis. He also does not see a reason for a case against ice ninja. Overall I am leaning towards town based on his activity and scum hunting posts he has made.<br>\n<br>\nPeabody - posts this game = 6, answered ICE's questions, questions AMPs late RVS vote and erratus points out he beleives that is a nervous scum comment.He questions the validity of erratus post (valid imo) peabody thinks pine might be afraid to jump on my bandwagon but agreeing with the bandwagon calling him inconsistent. This is a good read imo. I am leaning towards Peabody being town, but would like to see a bit more action from him.<br>\n<br>\nValern - posts this game = 9, made a few comments on his playstyle probably spawned from ICE's questions but he didnt answer them directly. Liked DRK's case on me as well as Romanus' vote on Pine. He then decided I was probably the best choice to hop on as a bandwagon and hopped on. Doesnt post unless he has something worthwhile to say and skims walls. So he may or may not even be reading this <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\"> He likes Romanus' posting and questions ICE on whether he thinks less posts = scummy. even after claiming he feels I would be a good lynch if I dont show \"improvement\" even though thusfar he had barely posted and jumped on a bandwagon himself. So what I have from Valern is that he wants a quick lynch which is VERY anti-town as it does not allow us to gather any information which is essential on day 1. Valern then decided I can wait due to an over-reaction from ICEninja. He keeps mentioning in a few of his additional posts that everyone shoudld be looking for scum yes I really dont think he's doing a good job. IMO he's trying to seem hepful to the town without actually being helpful. Pretty confident he's scum.<br>\n<br>\nDeathRowKitty - posts this game =17, makes random vote, then switches to a pretty much other random vote, doesnt mind larger posts as long as it is not all the time, then he would skim through. Didnt seem to like having a night 0 or any of ICE's questions. Started a bandwagon on me from things I considered to be pointless or irrelevant however I think with nothing to go off of, it probably was good enough for day 1. Made several osts to me and others ecplaining his reasoning. He endorsed the lynch based on his reasonings and tried to get other people on his bandwagon. After my claim he no longer agreed with the wagon and unvoted. He doesnt like the ICE wagon and says AMP, Trendall and Valern were peaking his scumdar next. Then voted for Valern stating he was too cool to give a reason. He also critisizes Erratus for his quoting of ICE and considering everything ICE says to pretty much be scummy. I think DRK is town based on the quality of most of his posts thusfar. I think he has good intentions in this game.<br>\n<br>\nPine - posts this game = 14, pro-wall, answers questions from ICE, calls out the dumb comment made from ranger of the north (who was asking for clarification on a stupid statement...), liked my bandwagon but decided he'd rather keep his vote on peabody for some extra pressure. Then rescinds his feelings that the post was dumb since ranger didnt get ofended..I think Pine is acting scummy and inconsistent. Unvoted peabody then decided he was going to re-read the thread and maybe put me at L-1 the next morning, which he never made another comment. I am leaning towards him being a following piece of scum. I'd actually go with pretty confident.<br>\n<br>\nAMP - posts this game = 5, Answered ICE's questions, Discusses that he hates night 0 and why. Posts to tell us he forgot about this game and is reading now and will give opinions.Discusses why a townie may lie in response to the whole erratus thing. Then disagrees that the congrats to the doctor tell is a valid scum tell. Then says I had an OMGUS vote (not sure what this was about since I didn't have one?) but decides to sit back and let other people pressure me since they were dong a good enough job (I think that's more lurking..keep providing input please..if you have questions..ask them.) Then discusses that he feels ong posts pretty much usually contain fluff. Then goes back on a V/LA for 48 hrs due to a family emergency. Not much going on here since most of the time he has not been in the game. So the only confusing thing to me was the comment on the OMGUS vote which he thinks I made that I didnt. Perhaps he was reaching at air trying to think of something to bring to the table. Either way I dont have a good enough read on him.", "time": "Wed Mar 30, 2011 7:18 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=16947&start=100", "forum": "53", "thread": "16947"}

In my experience, townies are more vocal, or at least more insulting, towards their accusers, while scum want to be diplomatic in their defenses to avoid pissing off more townies.

All-together, after rereading everything, I'm fairly confident that the reason I voted for you over the other people on ICE's wagon was mostly do to the overall tone and lack of decorum in your posts, which I think is a null-tell at best.

I have no issue with your conciseness views by themselves, though I personally think post length is generally more indicative of style rather than alignment...if walls were anti-town, Mastin would be policy-lynched in every game he plays in.

If there was scum on her wagon, why not let them help you lynch scum?

Kind of difficult to get a sense of time and who's lurking when you're reading straight through however. So here's what I noticed:<br>\n<br>\n-ICEninja wagon was quite possibly the scummiest wagon I've ever seen. Romanus doesn't read ICEninja's post, and then votes him for reasons blatantly contradicting ICE's post. Trendall jumps on right after him for what seems like no reason whatsoever. We later learn that he never let down his early ICEninja read and was just focusing on getting a read on Lucresia. I'm getting some scum vibes from this as the flip doesn't come until after Lucresia gave her claim post. After Trendall's vote, EA throws down a vote with actual reasons in it! I don't really think it's as valid when ICE comes in and says:\n<blockquote><div><cite>ICEninja wrote:</cite>I normally don't like to use meta as a defense, but me making strongly worded votes in the beginning of a game is completely normal for me regardless of my role. I just don't like RVS very much. Your vote on me is just as weak is mine was on you, but your's isn't for the purpose of getting us out of RVS. It's terrible.</div></blockquote>\nWhile yes EA was being sarcastic when responding to ICE's questions, ICE used this to get out of RVS. No one's going to accept it as a standalone case now, but at the time, it was a very pro-town move by ICE.<br>\nValern then jumps on the wagon for, well, you can go back and read the posts for yourself... Basically another bad vote on ICE.<br>\n<br>\n-Valern's voting patterns. I would have brought up a VCA if ICE didn't do it. Valern has been late on all wagons. The first was copying drk's reasons. The second, I have no clue. The 3rd one on Trendall was somewhat decent but the reasons for voting seem oddly similar to DY's.<br>\n<br>\n-Trendall: So most points have already been brought up, but to reiterate:<br>\nWishy-washy on Lucresia. Bad ICE vote. Current Valern vote seems extremely uninformed and looks like bandwagon hopping in an effort to prevent a self-lynch.<br>\n<br>\n-Peabody: No vote until page 6, and even then, the Pine case was a load of crap.

In context it just read to me like he didn't even care to properly defend himself, so he was going to throw out some name-calling instead and see if that discouraged the wagon on him. I kept my vote on him as long as I did because I felt he was too defensive + defending himself poorly to be town. I feel a lot better about him now that he's stopped being defensive and started doing more scumhunting, but he's still not quite made it to my town list.<br>\n<br>\nI realize this probably comes a little too late to be particularly useful, but I was looking at the wiki pages of quite a few of the people in this game earlier today, and noticed on Trendall's it said he's always been town. This led me to glance at a few of the completed games, and the difference between his posting there and his posting here is truly night-and-day.

That really reeks to me. Peabody's attacks on Pine all game have seemed a little strange to me. They were incredibly adamant, even in the face of next to no evidence. Now, just a few posts after being called on his sheepish vote on Trendall by DarthYoshi, he's trying to backpeddle off of that wagon as best he can, while still advocating that we lynch Trendall. </div></blockquote>\nRanger, I still believe my case on Pine is alright although many others disagree.  I believe I was onto something when I pointed out his strong accusation against me and then him unvoting without me posting at all.  I am sorry you do not agree that my point is even valid.  In reference to the post by DarkYoshi, you are right that I changed my mind, but it was not because I am scum.  I am not scum, but my reasons for backpedaling were prompted by Yoshi's accusation that I did not have reasons for voting Trendall.  After thinking about it, I really didn't have much on Trendall.  My unvote was because I realized I was doing just as I said in the above paragraph: I picked a person the town wanted to lynch without having reasoning of my own.  Like I said, it is easy to pick a person and then provide reasons for fosing them later.  I do not want to do that, and once I realized that was what I was doing, I stopped and backpedaled.<br>\n<br>\nICEninja's 221: I agree that this wagon has mounted incredibly fast, and I think it's possible scum are jumping on an easy lynch.  My vote and unvote of Trendall was completely suspicious, and that piled on my 'weak' cases against Pine are easy ammunition for those who really want to stalk and kill the town at night (and in the day).<br>\n<br>\nErratus' 237 - Your case was that I am contradicting myself.  I agree that my recent behavior has seemed a bit scummy, but if you read my paragraphs above, you see that I caught myself thinking in an anti-town way when I voted Trendall.  I realized my mistake, and I unvoted him.  The difference between my case against Pine and what I've been doing is that I have actually done some scumhunting by asking questions whereas in Pine's instance, 100% of his voiced suspicion, at that time, were first voiced by other people.   When 100% of your suspicion is founded on reasons other town members have presented, it looks scummy.  My suspicions and questions have not been that way except for my recent vote on Trendall which I tried to fix by unvoting.  <br>\n<br>\n  I do not think all sheeping is bad.  In fact, if you present a good argument, you should expect people to agree with you.  I do not think bandwagoning is bad as long as it is used in a protown way.  My initial case against Pine was not solely that he was sheeping or bandwagoning, but it was that his sheeping and bandwagoning were consistent with the level of his scumhunting at that point in the game.<br>\n<br>\nIn my instance, however, I felt the need to unvote Trendall because I voted him when I wasn't sure of why I was voting him.  Again, this is anti-town.  Therefore, I unvoted.", "time": "Wed Apr 06, 2011 5:50 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=16947&start=225", "forum": "53", "thread": "16947"}

I will accuse the mod of lying about the flip before I will believe a Town!Trendall flip.<br>\n<br>\nBut even regardless of Trendall's alignment, <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">I don't see any motivation for Scum!Peabody to unvote at that point that makes sense.</div> A smart Scum!Peabody probably would have bussed Scum!Trendall super hard because at that point Trendall's wagon looked pretty close to inevitable, and if he was going to not vote his buddy I would think any scum with a lick of sense would have avoided voting and then unvoting. Likewise, a smart Scum!Peabody probably would have kept his vote on a Town!Trendall and then lurked the rest of day and worried about washing his hands of the mislynch vote tomorrow (probably by pushing my mislynch next given that so many people seem to be at the very least okay with the idea).<br>\n<br>\nThis leaves the very obvious possibility that, maybe, Scum!Peabody just isn't very smart. And maybe that's a possibility, but I like to think I'm pretty good at reading people and I don't think he's an idiot, or at least not the kind of idiot that would vote/unvote a popular wagon and then give such a weak reason for doing so as scum. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">I've got a strong gut feeling of, \"it's such a lame reason it <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">must</div> be true\" going on with that whole \"I unvoted because my vote was anti-town\" thing.</div><br>\n<br>\nNext, we've got Pine. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">If Peabody is scum, Pine is probably not scum with him.</div> Similarly, I will eat my hat if Pine isn't scum, but I'm a little less sure of him than I am of Trendall at the moment. Pine has not only sheeped on cases but spent pretty much the entire game so far tunnelling on Peabody for what were, until very recently, pretty weak reasons, to the point that it got distracting. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">I get the feeling the only reason he even bothered FOSing me when he said little or nothing about me before that </div>(despite me making it very clear I suspected him) <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">was to try to ingratiate himself with the crowd of people who think I'd be a good second or third choice for a lynch</div> (most of whom I think are town, so it definitely makes sense that scum!Pine would try to get in their good graces).<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Then, there's the fact of how quickly the Peabody wagon sprung up and the Trendall wagon dissipated.</div> This makes a lot more sense if Peabody is town than if he's scum. If he's scum, then I'd be willing to bet that both of his buddies are probably on his wagon bussing him, and considering there's no way Pine is one of his scumbuddies given his and Peabody's earlier interactions and I have townish reads on everyone else on the wagon except for DarthYoshi, that probably means several of my town reads are wrong.<br>\n<br>\nThis is going to sound incredibly cocky, and I apologize in advance for that. (side note: geez, I end up apologizing for my cockiness in almost every game I've ever played, here and offsite.

I wasn't going to say anything about my find, because if I tell people I have a secret town-tell, they want me to tell them what it is before they'll believe me, but if everyone knows what it is, it ceases to be a town-tell. But it's there, I definitely saw it, and I'll share it and why it works in post-game if we win. <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\"><br>\n<br>\n----<br>\n<br>\nI realize that, in all likelihood, no one is going to listen to a word I just said, at least not right now.

In that case, I ask one thing and one thing only: <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">if you're not willing to listen to me now, please for the love of whatever gods you believe (or don't) in, come back to this post when Peabody and/or I am dead.

As a head's-up, how you answer this question will determine whether or not I decide to keep pushing your lynch.</div></blockquote>\nI believe I was capable of putting a sound vote down, and in fact, my vote was on Pine.  No one (Lucresia aside) considered my case though I thought the case was decent.  When I voted Trendall, I saw that my Pine vote was not put to good use because no one else took my case seriously at all.  The likelihood of a Pine lynch was low at that point, so I decided to use my vote somewhere else.  When I saw the Trendall wagon building, I decided to go with it because of the reasons I stated in my defense.  I realized my Trendall vote was bad, so I unvoted.<br>\n<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>DarthYoshi wrote:</cite>Also, what is \"good\" sheeping or bandwagoning to you? You characterize Pine's sheeping and bandwagoning as the bad kind--and you may well be right--but how would you characterize your own sheeping and bandwagoning, and if it was bad, why is it any different from Pine's?</div></blockquote>\nIt is not realistic for every player in the game to vote for the same person for different or previously unstated reasons.  There are only so many legitimate accusations that could be thrown before dumb/weak reasons are given.  The differences between a \"good\" (or a better word would be \"acceptable\") bandwagon/sheep vote and a bad bandwagon/sheeping vote is the motivation behind it.  A bandwagon/sheep vote is acceptable if either 1) the player truly is convinced by the mounting evidence against the player or 2) if the player is trying to put pressure on the accused person to get a better read.  A bad bandwagon/sheep vote is when the player who placed it neither 1) truly believes the person in question is mafia or 2) is trying to get a better read of the accused player.  <br>\n<br>\nIf you do not believe a person is mafia or if you are not trying to apply pressure, I venture to say the sheep or bandwagon is scummy/bad.  My vote was based on neither of those reasons, thus, I unvoted.  It was a bad vote by me regardless of Trendall's alignment.<br>\n<br>\nHowever, a person is expected to pull their weight when they are playing this game.  If all a person does is bandwagon or sheep, they do not contribute much to the town and thus become worthless to furthering the town's pursuit after scum.  Scum does not scumhunt because there is no scum to hunt.  My vote on Pine was not based fully on the fact that he sheeped or bandwagoned, but it was based on the fact that 100% of his voiced suspicion was already previously stated by someone else.  He has not pulled his weight, and that lack of genuine scum-hunting led me to believe he is either placing those votes to appear as town or he doesn't want to find scum.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>ICEninja wrote:</cite>Pine, out of context, looks more or less fine. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">However, taking his votes out of ISO and in to the game are pathetically weak or sheepish, without having done much of anything to advance the game.</div></div></blockquote>\nThis is what I've been trying to say all game!<br>\n<br>\nAlso, I like Valern's post 246, and now Valern is my strongest town read (and this is NOT because he was defending me).  His reasoning was good and his case was solid.  It is unlikely for scum to be so thorough in their reasoning.

Pine's posts are one massive bunch of <div style=\"display:inline;color:#BF8000\">Peabody-tunnelling</div>, <div style=\"display:inline;color:#40BF00\">procrastination</div> and off-topic fluff. In my opinion, Pine's tunnelling of Peabody started after he was accused of sheeping after <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2902321#p2902321\" class=\"postlink\">his 4th post</a> (and I certainly do think he was sheeping). He then constantly tunnelled Peabody in an attempt to disprove this image. To be fair, Peabody has not really been particularly pro-town, but it's really, really hard to believe that he's scum. It just doesn't feel right.<br>\n<br>\nBut what really makes me think Pine is scum is his <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2939300#p2939300\" class=\"postlink\">endless</a> <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2939344#p2939344\" class=\"postlink\">procrastination</a> <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2940577#p2940577\" class=\"postlink\">on</a> <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2941801#p2941801\" class=\"postlink\">the</a> <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2943433#p2943433\" class=\"postlink\">cases</a> <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2943872#p2943872\" class=\"postlink\">he</a> <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2945914#p2945914\" class=\"postlink\">was</a> going to bring up.

I believe Romanus' reason for unvoting was good.  <br>\n<br>\nIn my reread of the case against the Lucresia slot, I realized that there was some merit behind it which makes me wonder why ICEninja never jumped on that wagon.

Then I looked back and saw DRK voted you as well. I'm going to guess you meant the second possibility but you still earned some scum points here.<br>\n<br>\nI also don't like your VCA either. It's basically dividing everyone into three groups of three and saying there's probably one scum in each. It doesn't really help our chances for today that much since the likelihood of lynching scum in that case (assuming you're correct) is still 1/3. Additionally it completely ignores the other wagons of Day 1.<br>\n<br>\nValern's unvote concerns me as well. While the reason given is that there are fewer votes required to lynch, Peabody was at L-2 at the time. 5 votes isn't as many as we needed yesterday, but a quick lynch would have pointed out obvious scum and as such I doubt we would have gone to lynch without a decent amount of discussion.<br>\n<br>\nI'm not completely convinced with this inhimshallibe case.

After this, he replaces, Mersaniel makes a single post, and then we get inhim. His posts actually have a decent amount of scumhunting, but they lack continuity which was a result of him catching up. His enitre slot before him lurked a ton, which I'm willing to say is more of a null-tell as a result of <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2868677#p2868677\" class=\"postlink\">this</a> (read to the lynch to find out why).

Saying that you're perfectly happy to lynch a third of the town today without ever narrowing that down is scummy, if only slightly. Defending inHim's scumlist here would have been an odd choice if he had flipped town. Since he flipped scum, it makes me very suspicious.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>crazypianist1116 wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Erratus Apathos wrote:</cite>Okay, I read all of D3 AND RBT's iso in that game, and I have one question: what the fuck does it have to do with anything at all in this game?

Before the wagon, he had ~ 11 posts out of 400+, several of which weren't useful, which led people to believe he was lurking. As such, I get a bit worried over jumping the low post count gun.<br>\n<br>\nI'll start to get antsy if inhim plays poorly today, but I'd rather wait for content today from him before I make that decision. </div></blockquote>\nUsing anecdotal evidence to attempt to show that something that clearly benefits scum isn't a scum-tell is at the very least bad reasoning. Clearly, not all lurkers are scum. A slot that lurks across three different players, whose only contribution to the game was a couple of catch-up posts and some theory discussion, and who isn't posting even after he's under pressure is at the very least bad for the town and likely to be scum.

I think it's likely that our last scum (I'm presuming we only have one more for balance reasons) is a power role given that the two that have flipped were goons, and Roleblocker seems to be the most common mafia role given this site's meta, so this is definitely a concern.

It is one of the most commonly done skills as scum to appear that they find someone scummy but to not actually want their lynch. You absolutely looked like you were doing just this. You pointed out, to a very slight degree, who that slot had done that was scummy, then you went about pushing another player's lynch for most of the day.\n<blockquote><div><cite>Quilford wrote:</cite>\nWhy <div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">wasn't my vote on crazy very good</div>?\n</div></blockquote>\nUnderlined mine to put the quote in context. Your entire vote was \"I vote for crazy based on reasining that I said <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">in my very first post of the game</div>. There are 2 things wrong with this. One, the information was outdated. Two, your conclusion of the slot in said post was <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">slightly leaning</div> scum. You can't just say \"alright I'll lynch this player who is slightly leaning scum without contributing anything more to the discussion\". It was a weak bus.<br>\n<br>\nFor the record, I had every intention to hammer crazy, but he self hammered. I made it very clear towards the end of the day that he was the player I wanted lynched, and I made no attempt to shift the wagon elsewhere.<br>\n<br>\nFurthermore, we should probably be looking for players who bussed. Crazy would not self hammer if his scum buddy wasn't on the wagon already, thus denying him the chance to gain some town cred. Since both scum have flipped goon, we've probably got a remaining power role (I'm guessing role blocker, as it is most common). Power roles usually bus their goons for town cred.\n<blockquote><div><cite>Valern wrote:</cite>\nBut I'll let those who've been here longer weigh the risks vs benefits of such a strategy.\n</div></blockquote>\nAs I said, it seems like the likelihood of the last scum being a role blocker is way too high to employ this strategy. I say it is definitely out.\n<blockquote><div><cite>Valern wrote:</cite>\nRomanus/Crazy slot's vote/unvote on ICE seems like an obv-bus/distancing manoeuvre in hindsight. \n</div></blockquote>\nNow that you point this out, it sort of does, and there's really not much I can say to defend myself from this point. It was just a bad vote made by scum, really. They do that to town to try and get bandwagons rolling, which he did. Once he was called out on it, he backtracked so hard.\n<blockquote><div><cite>Valern wrote:</cite>\nand then there's the reason I initially voted him in the first place, which is that he had a scummy overreaction to people voting him. This point is still valid.\n</div></blockquote>\nI'm pretty sure that wagon on me was horrible, and it fell apart for good reasons. I didn't overreact to anything, a significant wagon jumped on me for abysmally bad reasons, and I reacted just the right amount. You never had valid reasons for voting me, and you can't use these to vote for me now.\n<blockquote><div><cite>Valern wrote:</cite>\nNK speculation in his above post.

Definitely not pro-town, and completely void of scum hunting. Town doesn't actually know who scum is, and therefore needs to put forth effort to find them.

Go read the game up to that point. If you can think of a better reason to vote someone based on the information we had at the time, then please show it to me. It was a serious vote in that it wasn't based on someone's name, avatar, random.org, or something else equally useless. No votes placed in the first few pages are as serious as a vote placed to lynch someone on page 10. The fact that you're pushing this is <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">ridiculous</div>.<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Quilford wrote:</cite><br>\nThis entire post seems to be about easing out of the EA wagon and onto Lucresia<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\nI was never really on an \"EA wagon\", as there were never very many votes on him. I simply prompted him to action, and which point he got very grumpy indeed. He is an unpleasant person to play with. It is not at all against my character (alignment neutral) to point out when someone is being unpleasant to play with. It wasn't a \"tension breaker\" or any crap like that. He was just getting on my nerves.<br>\n<br>\nOf course I was talking about the Lucresia wagon, as it was the wagon that had the most merit at that point in time. Was I convinced she was scum? Absolutely not. Was there potential for it? Sure. Worth the comment. This says nothing of my alignment.<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Quilford wrote:</cite><br>\nEmpty promise; there was never any meta analysis.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\nIt was no longer necessary. Plus, this wouldn't be the first time town-ICE has promised to read someone's meta and never followed through with it. It's a lot of work to do correctly, as you obviously didn't do when you did your little meta-dirt-throwing.<br>\n<br>\nI'm terrible as scum. I'll admit it. So when you go look at the wagons placed on scum-ICE in those games, they're more or less valid, save Javert's case against me in my more recent scum game. I was squirming under pressure of people who had reasons to vote me. This game, people were voting me for either garbage reasons (Valern) or non existent reasons (Trendall and Romanus). I've never in my mafiascum career had a wagon that bad thrown on me before, so you can't make meta comparisons to things that haven't happened.<br>\n<br>\nAnd I'll be damned if you went through all of my town games to confirm that I don't make such posts. You just found what you wanted in my scum games and posted it.<br>\n<br>\nTerrible dirt throwing, and meaningless when trying to examine my alignment.<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Quilford wrote:</cite><br>\nAnother empty promise.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\nFunny, you must have missed <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2933567#p2933567\" class=\"postlink\">post 170</a> when I followed through on that promise.

I probably should have taken notes on specifics, but I didn't, so here's my \"I don't want to be stabbed repeatedly for hammering without giving an explanation\" summary:<br>\n<br>\nValern was the first of the three players I decided I didn't want to vote.  I'd already decided that based on his self-vote, but had subsequently changed my mind and grown paranoid about him doing that as WIFOM.  On reread, Valern's posts just generally didn't set off my gut and had two things going for them:<br>\n1) His thought process this game has seemed town.  He's done some decent townhunting and scumhunting and his posts and stances have seemed very natural.<br>\n2) I can't actually remember any of them, but I remember catching a few nice town tells off of him.  That's actually what ended up making him suspicious of him at one point (some of my more recent scum play has involved abusing things that are town tells in the current meta, but really have no reason to be aside from the fact that scum tend not to do them), but I eventually decided it's better to just take them at face value and he really does seem town.<br>\n<br>\nTruth be told, my ICEninja read is a bit of a mess.  I thought he was town early, was a bit less sure later, decided he was town again, etc, and then made the same flip-flops during reread.<br>\n<br>\nSo while you could say my ICEninja read is overdeveloped to the point where all I can do with it is WIFOM myself, the problem with my Quilford read is that it's underdeveloped.  He replaced in around when I'd stopped paying much attention to the thread and I never got much of a feel for him in context.  In my reread now, I read the thread very much out of order (day 3, day 2, end of day 1, start of day 1, lthe last page or so of day 4, middle of day 1 or something like that (and with varying degrees of depth)) and, not surprisingly, still probably lost a lot of the context.  Quilford really hasn't stood out in his play in any way.  He replaced Lucresia, who looked pretty bad at the start of day 1, but then responded rather calmly to the ensuing pressure.  Her early vanilla claim made me write her off as town initially, but, depending on how familiar she is with either roles or site meta, it could be null.<br>\n<br>\nIf I'm going to be completely honest here, I haven't read Quilford very closely.  My choice of him as scum right now is based more on the other players seeming more town than he does than on an actual read of him.  The big thing that makes me question my ICE read (and it's probably been brought up by someone) is <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2959623#p2959623\" class=\"postlink\">this post</a> and his few after, which look like him awkwardly dancing around inHim's wagon.<br>\n<br>\nI'm not going to vote yet.  I would like to read certain things a little more closely when I'm less tired (yes, I know the deadline is in less than 24 hours) and then I'll look into placing a vote.<br>\n<br>\ntl;dr<br>\nQuilford &gt; ICEninja &gt;&gt; Valern, for now", "time": "Wed May 04, 2011 1:08 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=16947&start=475", "forum": "53", "thread": "16947"}

There's an ongoing I've been watching in which Lucresia did the exact same lurk-a-ton-and-get-replaced thing, and while that slot hadn't flipped last time I checked on that ongoing it's enough to make me think her lurky play wasn't an alignment tell.<br>\n<br>\nQuilford came in and singled out Crazy and Pine for being scum at a time when Crazy really particularly being suspected.

There was a lot of lurking going on with his slot in the midgame, but hell, he certainly wasn't the only one (hi, DRK). Crazy quite possibly tried to save Inhim at the last minute by jumping on to my Quilford bandwagon (as DRK pointed out), which, even if Quilford <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">was</div> scum, certainly wasn't a smart move given that whatever scum is left is probably a PR (ie, Crazy would have been sacrificing a PR to save a goon).<br>\n<br>\nYou are the only person who has never been on a scum wagon at the time a lynch occurred, aside from DRK. If you recall I suspected DRK before MC happened, because aside from being (now)confirmed DRK had far scummier play than anyone else here. You have been defensive most of the day today, whereas Quilford has been more aggressive (and as I believe I stated earlier today, I think too much time spent on self-defense is a scumtell.)<br>\n<br>\nI also think it's important to look at who has been killed and what their stances were. DarthYoshi was probably killed for suspecting inhim/crazy. Erratus died N2, who had probably the best vote on the early ICE wagon, had strong convictions on the Inhim wagon, and called people out for stalling the game around the time just for the sake of \"more information!\" (including ICE, but also myself, although I placed the hammer on that wagon after he said that, because fuck it if he wasn't 100% right that we probably weren't going to get anything else useful out of that day). Peabody died N3, shortly after bringing this up: <blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>@ICEninja, in my analysis of day 1, I noticed that you withheld your vote from Lucresia though you were suspicious, but you did vote both Erratus (based on lying to your questions) and on lynchking (due to his single 'scummy' vote post). Lucresia had a good case against her, and I'm wondering why, though you voiced suspicion, you voted for two other people who have less evidence against them rather than never placing a vote on Lucresia?<br>\n<br>\nI also noticed that you attacked Romanus for voting you based on false premises. After Romanus agreed that the bandwagon was on false premise, he unvoted. However, you asked a question:<br>\n<br>\n   <blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div> ICEninja 139 wrote:You haven't given any reason for no longer finding me scum, especially considering how you still feel like I did what you accused me of doing. It looks like a hasty retreat from a bandwagon that is falling apart.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nThis question looks forced. If Romanus unvoted because he found his vote was on a bad premise, why would he still find you as scum? I believe Romanus' reason for unvoting was good.<br>\n<br>\nIn my reread of the case against the Lucresia slot, I realized that there was some merit behind it which makes me wonder why ICEninja never jumped on that wagon. I cannot get a good read on Quilford yet.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nIn fact, all of D3 he was probably the person to say the most in a negative light about ICE, who of course during the night would have been the only scum left at that point. Hmm.<br>\n<br>\nAside from DarthYoshi having a thing against me, none of these are people who have particularly suspected me or Quilford IIRC. And sure, there are other reasons than \"ohnoez they haet me\" for scum to kill someone, but it's almost certainly a factor unless someone drops a PR tell or something.<br>\n<br>\nNormally I would go to the trouble of bolding my main points and all that shit, but I'm feeling lazy right now so instead you get a wallpost.", "time": "Wed May 04, 2011 3:01 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=16947&start=475", "forum": "53", "thread": "16947"}

He later justifies his vote with this:<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Valern wrote:</cite><br>\nICE is scummy because he went into SURVIVAL MODE ZOMG the moment he got some pressure on him. This is not a towny reaction to pressure. A towny reaction to being voted is to more or less ignore it (unless that person is voting them for scummy reasons) and continue to concentrate on scumhunting.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\nAs I responded shortly after:<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Myself wrote:</cite><br>\n<br>\nThis paragraph is so bad I don't even know where to begin.<br>\n1) Lucresia went in to survival mode way harder than I did, yet you unvoted her.<br>\n2) A townie reaction to being voted for reasons as bad as the ones put on me is NOT to ignore them.<br>\n3) The votes on me are awful, and I have every right to attack them.<br>\n4) I do happen to be concentrating on scum hunting, because I'm nearly positive that there is scum on my wagon somewhere.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nWhat i posted <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2933283#p2933283\" class=\"postlink\">here</a> is still valid. He was on all 3 early bandwagons, and late to boot. If you take my word for my alignment, all 3 of these early day 1 bandwagons he pushed were on townies. This is even worse now that we know the flips.<br>\n<br>\nValern also seemed to have weird reads on Lucresia. I get the vibe that he knew she was town by the way he posted during day 1, but I'm having a hard time qualifying this read. However, he definitely did seem to know Quilford would flip town despite my fairly solid case on him, and equally despite Quilford's severe lack of defense.<br>\n<br>\nValern played day 4 perfectly. He pushed my lynch, and declared Quilford town. If Quilford gets lynched, he gets town cred and has an easier time pushing my lynch. If I get lynched instead of Quilford, suddenly I flip town and Valern goes back and says \"Oh wow, I guess he must have been right after all!\" and wins the game with the Quilford lynch, especially considering how much clout there was on his lynch.<br>\n<br>\nI'd also like to note that DRK was the NK. Now obviously she was unlynchable, but she had the more solid stance that I'm town (at the end of day 4) compared to Ranger. Scum Valern would obviously take the player most interested in my lynch in to lylo. Scum ICE would have pushed harder for Valern being scum day 4 to convince DRK to shoot Valern.<br>\n<br>\nAdditionally, most of the reason for lynching me today seems to be about my not having been on any of the scum wagons. Recall that I was the one who asked inHim to claim, obviously showing intents to hammer. I also showed intents to hammer crazy, as well. Both hammers fell too quickly for me to do the honors. That isn't my fault.<br>\n<br>\nWhile it isn't that strong of a defense, it's something: most of the now dead townies had a town read on me.<br>\n<br>\nFinally, I apparently got a lot of town cred for accidentally pointing out that I have no night activity when I was prodded.

He wasn't on the bandwagons, even if he did express his willingness to hammer, but he also wasn't pushing alternate theories. Admittedly, pushing other wagons hard while scum is on the chopping block can be a big scum tell, but if a scum was hoping his partners wouldn't get lynched, but didn't want to draw attention to himself if they did, sitting in the background would be a much more subtle way to do it.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>ICEninja wrote:</cite>I will be setting aside time tomorrow to made a case.<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Ranger wrote:</cite><br>\nIce insisted a couple of times yesterday that he didn't think Crazy would have self-hammered without the last scum on the wagon.

Is it possible he hadn't posted in the scum QT for awhile? Sure.

You could easily have noticed that both Valern and Trendall claimed to have been prodded right after the game started, looked at the rules, figured out what it meant, and posted your claim to have been prodded in order to capitalize on that reason.

Even day 4, you didn't consider that I might be scum.
