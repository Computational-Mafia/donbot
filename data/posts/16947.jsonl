Days have deadlines of 7 days.<br><br>    * Day 1 has a deadline of 14 days.<br></div></blockquote><br>Days are shorter in this game than the standard game. With replacements we might be getting a few more hours, but don't count on being able to get more than 8 or 9 days to come to a lynch. I always do better with more time and more content to read, so I'll do my best to keep up here and I won't join any further games until I'm dead in here.<br><br>That being said, I'm going to expect each and every one of you to have substantial amounts of content on a regular basis.<br><br>I was going to point out the lack of no-lynch rule, but that was changed. Likewise, the mod changed his (previously horribly broken) exile policy. Many thanks for improving those rules.<br><br>Now on to my normal intro. I'd like to get a bit of information about everyone for my personal reference.<br>1) What is your timezone? This is helpful to know when we're waiting for a player to post, just in case they live overseas. This is particularly important as every hour is going to count in a 1 week deadline.<br>2) What is your mafia experience here and elsewhere? It is good to know who are first timers and who are veterans. Join date doesn't tell the whole story with alts and hiatuses.<br>3) How frequently can we be expecting you to post? Keep in mind the shorter deadlines.<br><br>1) I live in PDT, which is something like GMT -8.<br>2) I have an increasing number of on-site games (not quite 20) and have played (mostly modded) a good handful of party style mafia.<br>3) I will keep up my usual high frequency of large posts.

A scum's natural reaction would to be disappointed that they hadn't managed to kill someone in the case of the doctor, or that they hadn't killed someone important, in this case.

Hello everyone. I'm having a hard time with some stuff irl at the moment, so I may end up V/LA again at some point or another within the coming weeks. Having said that, I love playing this game, and will give it as much attention as I possibly can. If I feel like it's becoming a problem, I'll replace out. Your patience and understanding would be very much appreciated.<br><br>I did start writing down a big wall as I was reading along with the thread, but then found it wasn't really worth posting because a lot of times, I found something scummy, and then someone else would bring that thing up later on in the thread. So, everyone's being appropriately observant, which is nice. What I'd like to add to the Lucresia argument is this:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Lucresia wrote:</cite>You may not agree with a random vote but it doesn't make me scummy.</div></blockquote><br><br>Nobody said it did. Defending against something that nobody ever accused you of in the first place reeks of paranoia, and does make you scummy. Also...<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Lucresia wrote:</cite>A town player isn't allowed to be happy that main roles that help the town didn't get thrown out the window basically before the game really starts?</div></blockquote><br><br>Of course you are allowed to be happy that a PR didn't get killed. However, it's you categorically making the decision to type that out and tell everyone which rings alarm bells. Once again, you're trying to defend against something that nobody actually accused you of.<br><br>---<br><br>However, I'm not entirely sold on the Lucresia case, I wanna see more from her before I make a decision on that one. I agree that RangeroftheNorth's #44 was an incredibly awkward post. To me it seemed like he was trying to imply that Erratus has made a gigantic scumslip, when he quite obviously hadn't. It's an especially weird post seeing as Ranger acknowledges that there's an alternative way to interpret that sentence which is quite obviously the right one in his post. I also don't like ICENinja voting Erratus for lying, when it was really really painfully obvious that Erratus was just joking. Accusing someone of 'lying' like that, especially when it's a joke and completely irrelevant is just such an easy argument for scum to construct. Same with 'you are acting slightly differently in this game then you are to another game'. People's behaviour changes over games for a multitude of different reasons, and again, pointing out 'contradictions' like this that are totally irrelevant is something that scum like to do from my experience.<br><br>I really wish I could add more, but it seems like all my points have already been covered"}

I do think that the people lurking aren't helping the town, but that's mostly because they aren't giving us any information to analyze. I definitely think Lynchking should be prodded, and his absence is certainly anti-town, but I think its a null-tell at this point, not a scum-tell.<br><br>And no one has said that you were actually congratulating the doctor: what I, and others, have said, is that you expressing happiness that a power role wasn't killed is similar to congratulating the doctor, which is commonly seen as a scum tell.

Did not like the bandwagon against me. Changed his vote to Ice Ninja beleiving his posts were more scummy based on supporting my bandwagon but keeping a bad vote on Erratus.<br><br>lynchking - Posts this game = 1. Has only had one post the entire game which apologizes for lack of activity due to RL but promises to be more active. Agrees with DRK and Erratus' comments against me and jumps on the bandwagon. Despite his promise to be more active, it is now almost 2 full days later and hasn't provided any input to the game besides his jump on the bandwagon including his own feelings on any other player. Possibility of lurking scum although I can understand being busy as I too have had a very unexpected busy week. After the promise of activity without any follow through, I think he deserves an <span class=\"noboldsig\"> FOS: Lynchking</span>. This will however turn back to a vote if I don't see a more substantial post from him soon.<br><br>ICEninja - Posts this game = 18, (You will see a lot more information and notes on him just due to activity). Immediately draws everyone's attention to the day deadlines and requests everyone be very active. He maintains to be very active throughout the game having 18 posts overall. --consistency makes me lean towards town, however the next aspect I will discuss makes me think otherwise. <br><br>He asks everyone to answer a few questions that he wants just for his own personal knowledge, which I assume was also his way of starting conversation and activity. He also states he will be posting walls of texts. Brings up an old game and casts a vote on Erratus based on the questions ice asked. Although he says they weren't used to find scum, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">then contradicts himself </span> by saying someone was lying and that they must be scum based on the answer to a question that wasn't supposed supposedly being used to find scum in the first place.<br><br>Feels the reasons DRK has for voting me are very sound. Then quotes my reasoning for answering the questions he had and beleives that I was trying too hard to look town in my post and considered joining my bandwagon. I find this interesting because again, the questions that were only for his knowledge are being used in a way to help him determine if someone is scum or not.<br><br>Mentions he also thinks Pine is trying to hard to not look like he is sheeping but does not feel it is enough to change his vote from Erratus.<br><br>Mentions that the activity in this game is low and brings up the following as people who haven't posted much or posted anything he feels is worthwhile: Valern, Trendall, Romanus, &amp; AMP. Does NOT mention LynchKing who hasnt even posted at all! Possible scum buddy? But wait, makes a post the next day after lynchking makes his first post and identifies all the obvious things Ive already stated in this post (1 post, jumps on bandwagon) and changes his vote to him. I wonder though how heartfelt this vote really is. I think that his response to romanus the next day might be <span style=\"font-style: italic\">him </span> trying too hard to look like he isnt interested in my bandwagon nor still voting for erratus for no good reason. Then again as soon as I feel he might be scum, the next things he does seem town to me...he thinks valern has a bad mindset by wanting to just quick lynch me anyways (agreed btw...a quick lynch with barely any information is NOT a town mindset at all). He then confirms his previous posts throughout the game that he doesn't think anything Ive done or said yet is lynchworthy yet, just suspicious. Then decides after going back and forth a bit that Valern's bandwagon jumping You are a hard one to get a read on..that's for sure.<br><br>Trendall -posts this game = 7, I beleive the low activity was only due to his V/LA. Brought up some good points concerning what he felt about my posts and my bandwagon. He also based off that was not entirely sure that I was the right choice.He pointed out a few things he didn't like while ommitting things that had already been covered *(I like this because it allows you to want to read his posts and not just skim since the content is fresh and there is actual thought provoking ideas to consider. He also brings rangerofthenorth into the picture who accussed trendall of being strongly behind my wagon and even for voting for me which never happened. Neither of those 2 things were true based on Trendall's posts. I am pretty confident Trendall is town.<br><br>Erratus Apathos - posts this game = 10, answered ICE's questions but the answer's were obviously sarcastic. Voted peabody for being \"nervous scum\" which he later explains why he thought he acted like nervous scum, good enough for a first vote. Then gave a bs answer to a bs accusation ICE had based on him \"lying \" which was really just him being sarcastic to his questions. Then just said he agreed with DRK's post and hopped on my bandwagon. Then he is thoroughly convinced that I am scum and keeps urging people to vote for me and hop on my bandwagon. Then after my claim, erratus agrees with Romanus that he does not think my post was a scum gambit and unvotes me to vote for ice ninja based on thinking that his \"lie\" is noteworthy. (a \"lie\" which still was just frickin sarcasm from a game that shouldnt have been brought up since its ongoing anyways and ice hasn't dropped it yet) . Either way I can't get a good read on him. <br><br>RangeroftheNorth - posts this game = 13, answer's ICE's questions and discusses he prefers night 0's due to any information is better than none and more information = less chance of mafia manipulation. All these are fair statements. He then goes on to explain the congratulating the doctor tell and agrees with DRK's case on me. Then hops on the bandwagon. Then nitpicks and asks for clarification on something Erratus said. I think it was clear what Erratus meant, but perhaps ranger just wanted to post for the sake of posting? I can't imagine who really needed clarification on that statement..He then explains why he asked it but...it still seems strange to me. Regardless, strange doesnt necessarily mean scum. The rest of his posts are really saying that he finds me suspicious still but is not sure about me after my claim and unvotes. Then admits that re-reading trendall's posts he was far off on his analysis. He also does not see a reason for a case against ice ninja. Overall I am leaning towards town based on his activity and scum hunting posts he has made.<br><br>Peabody - posts this game = 6, answered ICE's questions, questions AMPs late RVS vote and erratus points out he beleives that is a nervous scum comment.He questions the validity of erratus post (valid imo) peabody thinks pine might be afraid to jump on my bandwagon but agreeing with the bandwagon calling him inconsistent. This is a good read imo. I am leaning towards Peabody being town, but would like to see a bit more action from him.<br><br>Valern - posts this game = 9, made a few comments on his playstyle probably spawned from ICE's questions but he didnt answer them directly. Liked DRK's case on me as well as Romanus' vote on Pine. He then decided I was probably the best choice to hop on as a bandwagon and hopped on. Doesnt post unless he has something worthwhile to say and skims walls. So he may or may not even be reading this <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\"> He likes Romanus' posting and questions ICE on whether he thinks less posts = scummy. even after claiming he feels I would be a good lynch if I dont show \"improvement\" even though thusfar he had barely posted and jumped on a bandwagon himself. So what I have from Valern is that he wants a quick lynch which is VERY anti-town as it does not allow us to gather any information which is essential on day 1. Valern then decided I can wait due to an over-reaction from ICEninja. He keeps mentioning in a few of his additional posts that everyone shoudld be looking for scum yes I really dont think he's doing a good job. IMO he's trying to seem hepful to the town without actually being helpful. Pretty confident he's scum.<br><br>DeathRowKitty - posts this game =17, makes random vote, then switches to a pretty much other random vote, doesnt mind larger posts as long as it is not all the time, then he would skim through. Didnt seem to like having a night 0 or any of ICE's questions. Started a bandwagon on me from things I considered to be pointless or irrelevant however I think with nothing to go off of, it probably was good enough for day 1. Made several osts to me and others ecplaining his reasoning. He endorsed the lynch based on his reasonings and tried to get other people on his bandwagon. After my claim he no longer agreed with the wagon and unvoted. He doesnt like the ICE wagon and says AMP, Trendall and Valern were peaking his scumdar next. Then voted for Valern stating he was too cool to give a reason. He also critisizes Erratus for his quoting of ICE and considering everything ICE says to pretty much be scummy. I think DRK is town based on the quality of most of his posts thusfar. I think he has good intentions in this game.<br><br>Pine - posts this game = 14, pro-wall, answers questions from ICE, calls out the dumb comment made from ranger of the north (who was asking for clarification on a stupid statement...), liked my bandwagon but decided he'd rather keep his vote on peabody for some extra pressure. Then rescinds his feelings that the post was dumb since ranger didnt get ofended..I think Pine is acting scummy and inconsistent. Unvoted peabody then decided he was going to re-read the thread and maybe put me at L-1 the next morning, which he never made another comment. I am leaning towards him being a following piece of scum. I'd actually go with pretty confident.<br><br>AMP - posts this game = 5, Answered ICE's questions, Discusses that he hates night 0 and why. Posts to tell us he forgot about this game and is reading now and will give opinions.Discusses why a townie may lie in response to the whole erratus thing. Then disagrees that the congrats to the doctor tell is a valid scum tell. Then says I had an OMGUS vote (not sure what this was about since I didn't have one?) but decides to sit back and let other people pressure me since they were dong a good enough job (I think that's more lurking..keep providing input please..if you have questions..ask them.) Then discusses that he feels ong posts pretty much usually contain fluff. Then goes back on a V/LA for 48 hrs due to a family emergency. Not much going on here since most of the time he has not been in the game. So the only confusing thing to me was the comment on the OMGUS vote which he thinks I made that I didnt. Perhaps he was reaching at air trying to think of something to bring to the table. Either way I dont have a good enough read on him."}

Scumslip here\u2014only scum feel the need to be so explicit in saying they have nothing to hide, especially when they haven\u2019t even been wagoned yet.<br><br>From ICE\u2019s #51: \u201cI'm considering joining the Lucresia wagon. I'll need to see how she responds to it.\u201d  Why didn\u2019t you join it then?  I think she was only L-3 then.  What\u2019s wrong with putting her at L-2?<br><br>Later, from ICE\u2019s #79: \u201cErratus's lie is very minor, so it isn't attracting lynchworthy suspicion from me, but it is still noteworthy in my eyes.\u201d  That\u2019s some badass backtracking, given how aggressive you were in voting him on p2.  Why vote for someone over a \u2018very minor\u2019 lie that isn\u2019t attracting \u2018lynchworthy suspicion\u2019 from you?  Doesn\u2019t a vote inherently imply that your suspicion is lynchworthy?  Wait, looks like EA nails this in #103.<br><br>Lucresia\u2019s #84: Which lurkers would you have gone after?  You just call out lurkers as a group.  Not helpful for your stated goal of actual catching scumz, so this looks more cosmetic than anything, especially when coupled with your #88\u2014you unvote without re-voting, why not re-vote another lurker and say why?<br><br>Pine\u2019s #90: Why do you see the need to so thoroughly explain an unvote that was doing no harm where it was at?  If you wanted to put Lucresia at L-1, why didn\u2019t you do that assessment on your own and not unvote if you felt Lucresia didn\u2019t merit an L-1 vote?<br><br>From Valern\u2019s #95: \u201cIf you're town, prove it. Start scumhunting. So far, you saying \"hey guys, we should be looking for scum\" followed by you not doing anything of the sort is just adding to your scumminess.\u201d<br><br>^This.<br><br>Romanus\u2019s vote of ICE in #98 is actually pretty sound\u2014ICE was hunting mostly on Lucresia, but has been parking his vote elsewhere.  Trendall\u2019s immediate sheeping in #99, however, is not, especially in light of the extensive lurking Trendall has been doing.<br><br>Valern\u2019s #102: \u201cI prefer short, fast-paced games that go too fast for people to get to the point.\u201d  This is not what I am used to from TownValern.  *stops assigning towncred*<br><br>DRK\u2019s #112: I am also suspicious of how quickly the ICE wagon formed, but picking Valern and explicitly not giving a reason is anti-town regardless of your alignment.  Valern\u2019s vote on ICE is terrible, it is more indicative of an opposition of personalities rather than alignment, but I want to hear your reasons for voting.  You rattle off a list of scumspects and don\u2019t actually say why you find them scummy.  Weak.<br><br>RoTN\u2019s #115: Why don\u2019t you want to lynch Lucresia anymore?  That post is hardly a ringing endorsement of her.<br><br>Valern\u2019s #117: \u201cA towny reaction to being voted is to more or less ignore it (unless that person is voting them for scummy reasons) and continue to concentrate on scumhunting.\u201d<br><br>I actually think it is the complete opposite.  In my experience, townies are more vocal, or at least more insulting, towards their accusers, while scum want to be diplomatic in their defenses to avoid pissing off more townies.  If this is your best reason for voting ICE, it\u2019s a bad one, especially compared to your reasons for voting Lucresia, which were actually a lot better, which makes me wonder why you voted ICE anyways\u2026maybe because he, unlike Lucresia, actually was doing scumhunting?<br><br>Skimmed Lucresia\u2019s wall in #122.  Her shortlist of reads seems townish, but there is a whole boatload of fluff and IIoA in there.  I\u2019m actually thinking she might be town, just not helpful town.<br><br>And that brings us to our current page.  My read on ICE is still neutral, maybe slightly town\u2026when he plays as town, he\u2019s a tough lynch, and he\u2019s defending himself more or less how I\u2019d expect TownICE to, but I\u2019m not yet confident enough in just putting him on my list of townreads.<br><br>Current scumlist (in order of most to least scummy):<br>-Trendall, active lurking ZOMG, his sheepy vote on ICE is incredibad.  Little to no scumhunting.<br>-Valern\u2014this is not at all like what I am used to seeing from Valern\u2019s town game, especially the ICE vote.<br>-AMP, see also: Trendall, re: active lurking.<br>-Lucresia, her early L-2 VT pseudo-claim screams \u201cpanicked town,\u201d and her #122 seems townish, so my scumread on her is relatively weak.  Not totally okay with her yet, though.<br><br>Vote: Trendall.  He could use some extra pressure, methinks.<br><br>Everyone else I currently have on either neutral or town reads.<br><br>@RoTN: Can you give me links to a recent town and recent scum game of your\u2019s?

Sorry about that.)<br><br><div align=\"center\"><hr style=\"height:14px; width:80%\"></div><br>- I'm slowly seeing a better defensiveness/scum-hunting ratio from <span class=\"noboldsig\">ICE</span> (I'm looking at post 126 here). It's a good start but not enough for me to want to take my vote off of him just yet.<br><br>- As I've said many times before by now, <span class=\"noboldsig\">Pine</span> is in my top three suspects, but I don't agree with <span class=\"noboldsig\">Peabody</span> (127) that bandwagoning is a scumtell. As with many other things, it's <span style=\"font-style: italic\">how</span> you do it, not <span style=\"font-style: italic\">what</span> you do. I do agree that the <span style=\"font-style: italic\">manner</span> in which <span class=\"noboldsig\">Pine</span> has jumped on wagons has been scummy, though.<br><br>-<span class=\"noboldsig\">RotN</span> (love the screenname/avatar, btw) has a mostly solid 129, but I don't at all agree with his <span class=\"noboldsig\">EA</span> vote. As I said before, he's one of if not <span style=\"font-style: italic\">the</span> strongest town read I have right now. 'Annoying' isn't a scumtell, especially if the person's being 'annoying' because of their aggressive way of scumhunting. <span class=\"noboldsig\">EA</span> is top on my town list mostly due to the way in which he dove into the spotlight early on and made efforts to stay there, which isn't something scum are very likely to do at all. (<span class=\"noboldsig\">DRK</span> is high on my town-list for a very similar reason, although zie hasn't been posting nearly as much lately by the looks of it.)<br><br>-My initial reaction to <span class=\"noboldsig\">Pine's</span> vote on <span class=\"noboldsig\">Peabody</span> in post 133 was that it was just... bad. But more on that in a bit.<br><br>-<span class=\"noboldsig\">EA</span> has a post full of self-defense (136) but I think his scumhunting near the end is probably on the right track. TBH I don't think I'd even noticed <span class=\"noboldsig\">AMP</span> was <span style=\"font-style: italic\">in</span> the game until I saw he was being replaced (along with me, ha). Very interested in seeing what the replacement has to say.<br><br>-More solid posting from <span class=\"noboldsig\">ICE</span> (139). I think it may be time to remove my vote, but I'll definitely continue keeping an eye on him.<br><br>-<span class=\"noboldsig\">Yoshi</span> #142: HI YOSHI! *wave*<br><br>- The back-and-forth between <span class=\"noboldsig\">Peabody</span> and <span class=\"noboldsig\">Pine</span> near the bottom of page 6 is mostly a waste of space imo, talking about stuff that happened pages ago. I have had a brief moment of hesitation about my scum-read on <span class=\"noboldsig\">Pine</span>, though, so I guess it wasn't <span style=\"font-style: italic\">all</span> for nothing. I can kind of see where he's coming from with 145. I'd like to see <span class=\"noboldsig\">Pine</span> do some commenting on people who aren't <span class=\"noboldsig\">Peabody</span> or <span class=\"noboldsig\">Lucresia</span>.<br><br>-Speaking of <span class=\"noboldsig\">Lucresia</span>, I don't like how she slunk back into the shadows after the pressure went off of her.<br><br>- I <span style=\"font-style: italic\">actually</span> read (most of) <span class=\"noboldsig\">Yoshi's</span> wall, haha. And to respond to what he said about me, <span style=\"font-style: italic\">this</span> is what I said:<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I prefer short, fast-paced games that go too fast for people to get to the point where they're posting walls full of argument by repetition/fluff/quote wars.</div></blockquote><br><br>You cut off everything that I wrote after \"get to the point\", which pretty drastically changes the meaning of the sentence. Why? And how is this sentence any different than the mantra I repeated in our newbie game that \"conciseness is pro-town\"?<br><br>Regarding your second quote of mine, <blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>\u201cA towny reaction to being voted is to more or less ignore it (unless that person is voting them for scummy reasons) and continue to concentrate on scumhunting.\u201d</div></blockquote> <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2887481#p2887481\" class=\"postlink\">I just got out of a game where I replaced in during LYLO</a>, and the scum were spending most of their time defending themselves and not scumhunting, whereas I and the other not-confirmed town spent a lot more time scumhunting than defending ourselves.

And I'm going to be joining the <span class=\"noboldsig\">Trendall</span> wagon if he doesn't respond well to the pressure on him. I initially thought his sheep vote on <span class=\"noboldsig\">ICE</span> was okay because he'd given more content earlier in the game, but he hasn't done pretty much anything since I don't think.<br><br>- @<span class=\"noboldsig\">Trendall</span> post 155: Is that really all you have to say? I think you may be taking the 'conciseness is pro-town' mantra way overboard.

It just feels like possible \"placeholder pressure\" you can point to to hop on a Ranger-wagon if that gains steam. Any other thoughts on Ranger?"}

He didn't like my wagon so much (for great reasons, it was awful), and scum hunted based on the people on my wagon. That is fine, but his vote for Erratus wasn't so great.

Quite an interesting read actually. Lots of stuff happened. Kind of difficult to get a sense of time and who's lurking when you're reading straight through however. So here's what I noticed:<br><br>-ICEninja wagon was quite possibly the scummiest wagon I've ever seen. Romanus doesn't read ICEninja's post, and then votes him for reasons blatantly contradicting ICE's post. Trendall jumps on right after him for what seems like no reason whatsoever. We later learn that he never let down his early ICEninja read and was just focusing on getting a read on Lucresia. I'm getting some scum vibes from this as the flip doesn't come until after Lucresia gave her claim post. After Trendall's vote, EA throws down a vote with actual reasons in it! I don't really think it's as valid when ICE comes in and says:<br><blockquote><div><cite>ICEninja wrote:</cite>I normally don't like to use meta as a defense, but me making strongly worded votes in the beginning of a game is completely normal for me regardless of my role. I just don't like RVS very much. Your vote on me is just as weak is mine was on you, but your's isn't for the purpose of getting us out of RVS. It's terrible.</div></blockquote><br>While yes EA was being sarcastic when responding to ICE's questions, ICE used this to get out of RVS. No one's going to accept it as a standalone case now, but at the time, it was a very pro-town move by ICE.<br>Valern then jumps on the wagon for, well, you can go back and read the posts for yourself... Basically another bad vote on ICE.<br><br>-Valern's voting patterns. I would have brought up a VCA if ICE didn't do it. Valern has been late on all wagons. The first was copying drk's reasons. The second, I have no clue. The 3rd one on Trendall was somewhat decent but the reasons for voting seem oddly similar to DY's.<br><br>-Trendall: So most points have already been brought up, but to reiterate:<br>Wishy-washy on Lucresia. Bad ICE vote. Current Valern vote seems extremely uninformed and looks like bandwagon hopping in an effort to prevent a self-lynch.<br><br>-Peabody: No vote until page 6, and even then, the Pine case was a load of crap. Further the Trendall vote came out of nowhere.<br><br>I'm open to a Trendall or Valern lynch today as there's an imminent deadline.<br><br>Feel free to bring any comments about Romanus to me. I don't exactly know exactly what he was thinking, but I'll defend him in my place.<br>I'll give some other reads as I go along, but nothing was as blatant as above."}

In context it just read to me like he didn't even care to properly defend himself, so he was going to throw out some name-calling instead and see if that discouraged the wagon on him. I kept my vote on him as long as I did because I felt he was too defensive + defending himself poorly to be town. I feel a lot better about him now that he's stopped being defensive and started doing more scumhunting, but he's still not quite made it to my town list.<br><br>I realize this probably comes a little too late to be particularly useful, but I was looking at the wiki pages of quite a few of the people in this game earlier today, and noticed on Trendall's it said he's always been town. This led me to glance at a few of the completed games, and the difference between his posting there and his posting here is truly night-and-day. Certainly not something I'd give much thought to on its own, but given the fact that he's apparently never been scum before, if this is his first scum game it would make perfect sense to see such a big difference in play.<br><br>If Trendall flips scum I'm going to be taking a very hard look at DeathRowKitty, who has been one of my stronger town reads most of the game, but jumped ship from Trendall's wagon when it started actually gaining a little steam (and also started posting less around the same time IIRC, although from isoing it looks like there's been a gradual decrease all game, so this might not actually have anything to do with Trendall). I also agree with Yoshi that one of Pine/Peabody is probably scum pending a Trendall scum flip, but it should be obvious by now who I think is the more likely scum out of the pair of them.<br><br>And apparently I get rambly when I'm tired. ._."}

Now that he has Trendall's claim, he unvotes, and, by the by, very diplomatically concedes that his vote was indeed a sheep vote, and proceeds with a whole bunch of gibberish about how really, he's fine with a Trendall lynch, but still unvotes.<br><br>What this says to me is that Peabody put Trendall at L-1 just to get a claim, and that he knows Trendall will flip town and wanted to pre-emptively wipe his hands clean after I threw a little heat his way.</div></blockquote><br><br>I understand your drift here.  You're analyzing my lack of input and filling in my motives.  Yes, I did vote Trendall at L-1, and yes, I did want a claim.  I did not know I was going to be unvoting Trendall at this point.  However, I got to thinking that my vote on Trendall was for all the wrong reasons: I was eager for the day to end, and I was down with the town lynching with whomever they thought was scum.  At the time of my unvote, I realized how unproper it was to vote for someone when I haven't fully investigated him.  The thing about making cases is that it is simple to pick a person and then decide the reasoning later.  If I were to follow through with the Trendall vote, that is exactly what I would have been doing.  It's anti-town thinking, and realizing my mistake, I unvoted.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>RoTN wrote:</cite>Peabody admitted he sheepishly voted Trendall, putting him at L-1, even though he wasn't actually suspicious of him at all. That really reeks to me. Peabody's attacks on Pine all game have seemed a little strange to me. They were incredibly adamant, even in the face of next to no evidence. Now, just a few posts after being called on his sheepish vote on Trendall by DarthYoshi, he's trying to backpeddle off of that wagon as best he can, while still advocating that we lynch Trendall. </div></blockquote><br>Ranger, I still believe my case on Pine is alright although many others disagree.  I believe I was onto something when I pointed out his strong accusation against me and then him unvoting without me posting at all.  I am sorry you do not agree that my point is even valid.  In reference to the post by DarkYoshi, you are right that I changed my mind, but it was not because I am scum.  I am not scum, but my reasons for backpedaling were prompted by Yoshi's accusation that I did not have reasons for voting Trendall.  After thinking about it, I really didn't have much on Trendall.  My unvote was because I realized I was doing just as I said in the above paragraph: I picked a person the town wanted to lynch without having reasoning of my own.  Like I said, it is easy to pick a person and then provide reasons for fosing them later.  I do not want to do that, and once I realized that was what I was doing, I stopped and backpedaled.<br><br>ICEninja's 221: I agree that this wagon has mounted incredibly fast, and I think it's possible scum are jumping on an easy lynch.  My vote and unvote of Trendall was completely suspicious, and that piled on my 'weak' cases against Pine are easy ammunition for those who really want to stalk and kill the town at night (and in the day).<br><br>Erratus' 237 - Your case was that I am contradicting myself.  I agree that my recent behavior has seemed a bit scummy, but if you read my paragraphs above, you see that I caught myself thinking in an anti-town way when I voted Trendall.  I realized my mistake, and I unvoted him.  The difference between my case against Pine and what I've been doing is that I have actually done some scumhunting by asking questions whereas in Pine's instance, 100% of his voiced suspicion, at that time, were first voiced by other people.   When 100% of your suspicion is founded on reasons other town members have presented, it looks scummy.  My suspicions and questions have not been that way except for my recent vote on Trendall which I tried to fix by unvoting.  <br><br>  I do not think all sheeping is bad.  In fact, if you present a good argument, you should expect people to agree with you.  I do not think bandwagoning is bad as long as it is used in a protown way.  My initial case against Pine was not solely that he was sheeping or bandwagoning, but it was that his sheeping and bandwagoning were consistent with the level of his scumhunting at that point in the game.<br><br>In my instance, however, I felt the need to unvote Trendall because I voted him when I wasn't sure of why I was voting him.  Again, this is anti-town.  Therefore, I unvoted."}

I don't even count that. <span class=\"noboldsig\">Anyone who's not a complete moron knows to respond to a wagon on them carefully and as townily as possible as either alignment.</span> Your \"coaching\" case is complete, unabashed bullshit, and letting everyone know my read on a player and that I fully intend to defend that player if I think their reaction isn't scummy ... isn't scummy.

I will accuse the mod of lying about the flip before I will believe a Town!Trendall flip.<br><br>But even regardless of Trendall's alignment, <span class=\"noboldsig\">I don't see any motivation for Scum!Peabody to unvote at that point that makes sense.</span> A smart Scum!Peabody probably would have bussed Scum!Trendall super hard because at that point Trendall's wagon looked pretty close to inevitable, and if he was going to not vote his buddy I would think any scum with a lick of sense would have avoided voting and then unvoting. Likewise, a smart Scum!Peabody probably would have kept his vote on a Town!Trendall and then lurked the rest of day and worried about washing his hands of the mislynch vote tomorrow (probably by pushing my mislynch next given that so many people seem to be at the very least okay with the idea).<br><br>This leaves the very obvious possibility that, maybe, Scum!Peabody just isn't very smart. And maybe that's a possibility, but I like to think I'm pretty good at reading people and I don't think he's an idiot, or at least not the kind of idiot that would vote/unvote a popular wagon and then give such a weak reason for doing so as scum. <span class=\"noboldsig\">I've got a strong gut feeling of, \"it's such a lame reason it <span style=\"font-style: italic\">must</span> be true\" going on with that whole \"I unvoted because my vote was anti-town\" thing.</span><br><br>Next, we've got Pine. <span class=\"noboldsig\">If Peabody is scum, Pine is probably not scum with him.</span> Similarly, I will eat my hat if Pine isn't scum, but I'm a little less sure of him than I am of Trendall at the moment. Pine has not only sheeped on cases but spent pretty much the entire game so far tunnelling on Peabody for what were, until very recently, pretty weak reasons, to the point that it got distracting. <span class=\"noboldsig\">I get the feeling the only reason he even bothered FOSing me when he said little or nothing about me before that </span>(despite me making it very clear I suspected him) <span class=\"noboldsig\">was to try to ingratiate himself with the crowd of people who think I'd be a good second or third choice for a lynch</span> (most of whom I think are town, so it definitely makes sense that scum!Pine would try to get in their good graces).<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Then, there's the fact of how quickly the Peabody wagon sprung up and the Trendall wagon dissipated.</span> This makes a lot more sense if Peabody is town than if he's scum. If he's scum, then I'd be willing to bet that both of his buddies are probably on his wagon bussing him, and considering there's no way Pine is one of his scumbuddies given his and Peabody's earlier interactions and I have townish reads on everyone else on the wagon except for DarthYoshi, that probably means several of my town reads are wrong.<br><br>This is going to sound incredibly cocky, and I apologize in advance for that. (side note: geez, I end up apologizing for my cockiness in almost every game I've ever played, here and offsite. It's becoming a trend. e.e) But, <span class=\"noboldsig\">if Peabody is scum then, as I see it, at <span style=\"font-style: italic\">least</span> four of my reads are dead, flat-out wrong, and I'm just NOT willing to accept that I've gotten that bad at this game.</span>  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_shifty.gif\" alt=\":shifty:\" title=\"Shifty-Eyed\"><br><br>Also, one more thing. <span class=\"noboldsig\">Peabody dropped something I view as a pretty strong town-tell in the early pages of the game</span>, and it's part of the reason I'm willing to continue defending him now even when half the game thinks both of us are scum. I wasn't going to say anything about my find, because if I tell people I have a secret town-tell, they want me to tell them what it is before they'll believe me, but if everyone knows what it is, it ceases to be a town-tell. But it's there, I definitely saw it, and I'll share it and why it works in post-game if we win. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\"><br><br>----<br><br>I realize that, in all likelihood, no one is going to listen to a word I just said, at least not right now.

In that case, I ask one thing and one thing only: <span class=\"noboldsig\">if you're not willing to listen to me now, please for the love of whatever gods you believe (or don't) in, come back to this post when Peabody and/or I am dead.

As a head's-up, how you answer this question will determine whether or not I decide to keep pushing your lynch.</div></blockquote><br>I believe I was capable of putting a sound vote down, and in fact, my vote was on Pine.  No one (Lucresia aside) considered my case though I thought the case was decent.  When I voted Trendall, I saw that my Pine vote was not put to good use because no one else took my case seriously at all.  The likelihood of a Pine lynch was low at that point, so I decided to use my vote somewhere else.  When I saw the Trendall wagon building, I decided to go with it because of the reasons I stated in my defense.  I realized my Trendall vote was bad, so I unvoted.<br><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>DarthYoshi wrote:</cite>Also, what is \"good\" sheeping or bandwagoning to you? You characterize Pine's sheeping and bandwagoning as the bad kind--and you may well be right--but how would you characterize your own sheeping and bandwagoning, and if it was bad, why is it any different from Pine's?</div></blockquote><br>It is not realistic for every player in the game to vote for the same person for different or previously unstated reasons.  There are only so many legitimate accusations that could be thrown before dumb/weak reasons are given.  The differences between a \"good\" (or a better word would be \"acceptable\") bandwagon/sheep vote and a bad bandwagon/sheeping vote is the motivation behind it.  A bandwagon/sheep vote is acceptable if either 1) the player truly is convinced by the mounting evidence against the player or 2) if the player is trying to put pressure on the accused person to get a better read.  A bad bandwagon/sheep vote is when the player who placed it neither 1) truly believes the person in question is mafia or 2) is trying to get a better read of the accused player.  <br><br>If you do not believe a person is mafia or if you are not trying to apply pressure, I venture to say the sheep or bandwagon is scummy/bad.  My vote was based on neither of those reasons, thus, I unvoted.  It was a bad vote by me regardless of Trendall's alignment.<br><br>However, a person is expected to pull their weight when they are playing this game.  If all a person does is bandwagon or sheep, they do not contribute much to the town and thus become worthless to furthering the town's pursuit after scum.  Scum does not scumhunt because there is no scum to hunt.  My vote on Pine was not based fully on the fact that he sheeped or bandwagoned, but it was based on the fact that 100% of his voiced suspicion was already previously stated by someone else.  He has not pulled his weight, and that lack of genuine scum-hunting led me to believe he is either placing those votes to appear as town or he doesn't want to find scum.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>ICEninja wrote:</cite>Pine, out of context, looks more or less fine. <span class=\"noboldsig\">However, taking his votes out of ISO and in to the game are pathetically weak or sheepish, without having done much of anything to advance the game.</span></div></blockquote><br>This is what I've been trying to say all game!<br><br>Also, I like Valern's post 246, and now Valern is my strongest town read (and this is NOT because he was defending me).  His reasoning was good and his case was solid.  It is unlikely for scum to be so thorough in their reasoning.  Valern's post has shown that he is legitimately thinking through the implications of his reads."}

After Romanus agreed that the bandwagon was on false premise, he unvoted.  However, you asked a question: <blockquote><div><cite>ICEninja 139 wrote:</cite><span class=\"noboldsig\">You haven't given any reason for no longer finding me scum</span>, especially considering how you still feel like I did what you accused me of doing.

When the heat turned up on Crazy's partner, Crazy distanced like hell and played uber-defensively.

Why did you attempt to refocus discussion as soon as a possible alternative lynch appeared?

I'll give you this point but I don't think it justifies a lynch.</div></blockquote><br>Overlooking scummy behavior because the player is a newb is very flawed reasoning. A newb scum is much less likely to know theory and tells, and is thus more likely to commit tells. Ignoring those tells because the player is new is a bad idea.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>crazypianist1116 wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Erratus Apathos wrote:</cite>That's not scumhunting, that's worthless crap.

I'm talking about the result inHim ends up at. He called half the living players scum. That's not an exaggeration, I mean <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2944706#p2944706\" class=\"postlink\">literally half</a>. Conveniently, pretty much everyone who was a plausible lynch candidate, save for Valern, showed up on the death list. Then he never filtered the list down to a usable number.

He just made a preposterous scumlist and sat on his ass.</div></blockquote><br>Yeah, and hey there can be a wagon on half the players in a game on any given day. It's possible to be suspicious of more people than there are scum as not everyone is a perfect townie. Regardless, you seem to have ignored this (inevitably as a result of you not reading his posts):<br><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>inhimshallibe wrote:</cite>We ought to be lynching one of {Pine, Peabody, Lucresia, Trendall} today.</div></blockquote><br>Now isn't that a usable number?</div></blockquote><br>Its barely a usable number, and he didn't give any preference to any of the people on the list. Saying that you're perfectly happy to lynch a third of the town today without ever narrowing that down is scummy, if only slightly. Defending inHim's scumlist here would have been an odd choice if he had flipped town. Since he flipped scum, it makes me very suspicious.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>crazypianist1116 wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Erratus Apathos wrote:</cite>Okay, I read all of D3 AND RBT's iso in that game, and I have one question: what the fuck does it have to do with anything at all in this game?

Before the wagon, he had ~ 11 posts out of 400+, several of which weren't useful, which led people to believe he was lurking.

Clearly, not all lurkers are scum. A slot that lurks across three different players, whose only contribution to the game was a couple of catch-up posts and some theory discussion, and who isn't posting even after he's under pressure is at the very least bad for the town and likely to be scum. If you'd simply said \"I'm not sure yet, I want to see what he posts,\" that would have been one thing. Actively defending him is something entirely different."}

He votes ICE for a bad reason and later unvotes, claiming that he \"obviously had not read ICE's last post when I made [his post]\" and \"had composed it much earlier and then posted it without checking.\" But the post where he voted ICE was so short that I don't think this was actually the case, and I think he was backtracking, trying to come up with a reason for his bad vote/unvote that didn't scream \"I'M DISTANCING FROM MY PARTNER, MMKAY\"<br>-and then there's the reason I initially voted him in the first place, which is that he had a scummy overreaction to people voting him. This point is still valid.<br>-PEDIT: NK speculation in his above post.

It is one of the most commonly done skills as scum to appear that they find someone scummy but to not actually want their lynch. You absolutely looked like you were doing just this. You pointed out, to a very slight degree, who that slot had done that was scummy, then you went about pushing another player's lynch for most of the day.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Quilford wrote:</cite>Why <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">wasn't my vote on crazy very good</span>?<br></div></blockquote><br>Underlined mine to put the quote in context.

You can't just say \"alright I'll lynch this player who is slightly leaning scum without contributing anything more to the discussion\". It was a weak bus.<br><br>For the record, I had every intention to hammer crazy, but he self hammered. I made it very clear towards the end of the day that he was the player I wanted lynched, and I made no attempt to shift the wagon elsewhere.<br><br>Furthermore, we should probably be looking for players who bussed. Crazy would not self hammer if his scum buddy wasn't on the wagon already, thus denying him the chance to gain some town cred. Since both scum have flipped goon, we've probably got a remaining power role (I'm guessing role blocker, as it is most common). Power roles usually bus their goons for town cred.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Valern wrote:</cite>But I'll let those who've been here longer weigh the risks vs benefits of such a strategy.<br></div></blockquote><br>As I said, it seems like the likelihood of the last scum being a role blocker is way too high to employ this strategy.

It was just a bad vote made by scum, really. They do that to town to try and get bandwagons rolling, which he did. Once he was called out on it, he backtracked so hard.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Valern wrote:</cite>and then there's the reason I initially voted him in the first place, which is that he had a scummy overreaction to people voting him. This point is still valid.<br></div></blockquote><br>I'm pretty sure that wagon on me was horrible, and it fell apart for good reasons. I didn't overreact to anything, a significant wagon jumped on me for abysmally bad reasons, and I reacted just the right amount. You never had valid reasons for voting me, and you can't use these to vote for me now.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Valern wrote:</cite>NK speculation in his above post. There is NO POINT to it and it only serves to pad his post and make it look like he has more to say with actual conviction behind it than he does.<br></div></blockquote><br>What? Scum killed a scum read of mine. Of course I'm going to say something on the matter. I fail to see anything useless or scummy about what I said.<br><br>Finally, there is Quilford bringing up my calling out of EA in order to get us out of RVS. Talk about desperate. If you guys seriously think that was a scum tell, I can think of 3 games just off the top of my head where I did the <span style=\"font-style: italic\">exact same thing</span> as town. It is a play style tell, not an alignment tell, and Quilford trying to throw that dirt in my face is scummy as hell.<br><br>Scum knows that I need to die today. DRK is going to be night killed out of necessity, and Ranger isn't going to be lynched. Whichever between QUilford and Valern is scum knows that they HAVE to take the other to lylo to win.<br><br>I'll dig down and present my findings of Quilford and Valern probably today. I'm almost positive that scum is between these two, and like I said in day 3, if Ranger is scum, he deserves to win.

So unless you can actually point out how any of this is scummy, you're just padding your case.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Valren wrote:</cite>And I'm not responding to you for the most part because there's no point in me responding to someone I know is scum except where it might be useful for non-scum to read it.<br></div></blockquote><br>Oh?

However, I don't see anything about you remembering a scum read on Peabody during day 3. Crazy was certainly not the only player alive you had suspected.<br><br>And it wasn't outdated per se, that was the wrong way of putting it. You added nothing new, contributed nothing for day 3 at all. You just said \"here is stuff I already said in my first post of the game, let's have a lynch\". Definitely not pro-town, and completely void of scum hunting. Town doesn't actually know who scum is, and therefore needs to put forth effort to find them. You already knew crazy was scum, so you didn't really have to go in depth to find anything. You just knew, so you bused based on that. Beyond the entry posts you made, which were quite good, you've done painfully little scum hunting.<br><br>I am eagerly awaiting scum hunting and cases from DRK and Ranger, as they are clearly the town players who will be setting the precedent for today."}

If i was lynched today, I would flip town and I have no doubt whatsoever that you and Quilford will be at each other's throats to win for your side. Based on the current lineup, I know I am not scum.

I probably should have taken notes on specifics, but I didn't, so here's my \"I don't want to be stabbed repeatedly for hammering without giving an explanation\" summary:<br><br>Valern was the first of the three players I decided I didn't want to vote.  I'd already decided that based on his self-vote, but had subsequently changed my mind and grown paranoid about him doing that as WIFOM.  On reread, Valern's posts just generally didn't set off my gut and had two things going for them:<br>1) His thought process this game has seemed town.  He's done some decent townhunting and scumhunting and his posts and stances have seemed very natural.<br>2) I can't actually remember any of them, but I remember catching a few nice town tells off of him.  That's actually what ended up making him suspicious of him at one point (some of my more recent scum play has involved abusing things that are town tells in the current meta, but really have no reason to be aside from the fact that scum tend not to do them), but I eventually decided it's better to just take them at face value and he really does seem town.<br><br>Truth be told, my ICEninja read is a bit of a mess.  I thought he was town early, was a bit less sure later, decided he was town again, etc, and then made the same flip-flops during reread.<br><br>So while you could say my ICEninja read is overdeveloped to the point where all I can do with it is WIFOM myself, the problem with my Quilford read is that it's underdeveloped.  He replaced in around when I'd stopped paying much attention to the thread and I never got much of a feel for him in context.  In my reread now, I read the thread very much out of order (day 3, day 2, end of day 1, start of day 1, lthe last page or so of day 4, middle of day 1 or something like that (and with varying degrees of depth)) and, not surprisingly, still probably lost a lot of the context.  Quilford really hasn't stood out in his play in any way.  He replaced Lucresia, who looked pretty bad at the start of day 1, but then responded rather calmly to the ensuing pressure.  Her early vanilla claim made me write her off as town initially, but, depending on how familiar she is with either roles or site meta, it could be null.<br><br>If I'm going to be completely honest here, I haven't read Quilford very closely.  My choice of him as scum right now is based more on the other players seeming more town than he does than on an actual read of him.  The big thing that makes me question my ICE read (and it's probably been brought up by someone) is <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2959623#p2959623\" class=\"postlink\">this post</a> and his few after, which look like him awkwardly dancing around inHim's wagon.<br><br>I'm not going to vote yet.  I would like to read certain things a little more closely when I'm less tired (yes, I know the deadline is in less than 24 hours) and then I'll look into placing a vote.<br><br>tl;dr<br>Quilford &gt; ICEninja &gt;&gt; Valern, for now"}

There was a lot of lurking going on with his slot in the midgame, but hell, he certainly wasn't the only one (hi, DRK). Crazy quite possibly tried to save Inhim at the last minute by jumping on to my Quilford bandwagon (as DRK pointed out), which, even if Quilford <span style=\"font-style: italic\">was</span> scum, certainly wasn't a smart move given that whatever scum is left is probably a PR (ie, Crazy would have been sacrificing a PR to save a goon).<br><br>You are the only person who has never been on a scum wagon at the time a lynch occurred, aside from DRK. If you recall I suspected DRK before MC happened, because aside from being (now)confirmed DRK had far scummier play than anyone else here. You have been defensive most of the day today, whereas Quilford has been more aggressive (and as I believe I stated earlier today, I think too much time spent on self-defense is a scumtell.)<br><br>I also think it's important to look at who has been killed and what their stances were. DarthYoshi was probably killed for suspecting inhim/crazy. Erratus died N2, who had probably the best vote on the early ICE wagon, had strong convictions on the Inhim wagon, and called people out for stalling the game around the time just for the sake of \"more information!\" (including ICE, but also myself, although I placed the hammer on that wagon after he said that, because fuck it if he wasn't 100% right that we probably weren't going to get anything else useful out of that day). Peabody died N3, shortly after bringing this up: <blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>@ICEninja, in my analysis of day 1, I noticed that you withheld your vote from Lucresia though you were suspicious, but you did vote both Erratus (based on lying to your questions) and on lynchking (due to his single 'scummy' vote post). Lucresia had a good case against her, and I'm wondering why, though you voiced suspicion, you voted for two other people who have less evidence against them rather than never placing a vote on Lucresia?<br><br>I also noticed that you attacked Romanus for voting you based on false premises. After Romanus agreed that the bandwagon was on false premise, he unvoted. However, you asked a question:<br><br>   <blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div> ICEninja 139 wrote:You haven't given any reason for no longer finding me scum, especially considering how you still feel like I did what you accused me of doing. It looks like a hasty retreat from a bandwagon that is falling apart.</div></blockquote><br><br>This question looks forced. If Romanus unvoted because he found his vote was on a bad premise, why would he still find you as scum? I believe Romanus' reason for unvoting was good.<br><br>In my reread of the case against the Lucresia slot, I realized that there was some merit behind it which makes me wonder why ICEninja never jumped on that wagon. I cannot get a good read on Quilford yet.</div></blockquote><br><br>In fact, all of D3 he was probably the person to say the most in a negative light about ICE, who of course during the night would have been the only scum left at that point. Hmm.<br><br>Aside from DarthYoshi having a thing against me, none of these are people who have particularly suspected me or Quilford IIRC. And sure, there are other reasons than \"ohnoez they haet me\" for scum to kill someone, but it's almost certainly a factor unless someone drops a PR tell or something.<br><br>Normally I would go to the trouble of bolding my main points and all that shit, but I'm feeling lazy right now so instead you get a wallpost."}

It is distancing. When he comes in later and votes his buddy, who is certainly facing death, for the same reasons he called him \"slightly leaning scum\", it then becomes necessary busing.

That is simply because he cannot defend himself against such valid points, He instead used misdirection to attempt to hide the fact that he didn't defend himself from anything. \"Show me examples\" and \"how does that make me scum\" (when it obviously does, no explanation needed) isn't a pro-town way to defend yourself from a case.<br><br>Valern, didn't you just recently call me scum because I speculated on night kills and was thinking about what scum did and such?

Further analysis of Valern's play past day 1 will follow later.<br><br>His vote for me was just terrible. He later justifies his vote with this:<br><blockquote><div><cite>Valern wrote:</cite>ICE is scummy because he went into SURVIVAL MODE ZOMG the moment he got some pressure on him. This is not a towny reaction to pressure. A towny reaction to being voted is to more or less ignore it (unless that person is voting them for scummy reasons) and continue to concentrate on scumhunting.<br></div></blockquote><br>As I responded shortly after:<br><blockquote><div><cite>Myself wrote:</cite><br>This paragraph is so bad I don't even know where to begin.<br>1) Lucresia went in to survival mode way harder than I did, yet you unvoted her.<br>2) A townie reaction to being voted for reasons as bad as the ones put on me is NOT to ignore them.<br>3) The votes on me are awful, and I have every right to attack them.<br>4) I do happen to be concentrating on scum hunting, because I'm nearly positive that there is scum on my wagon somewhere.<br></div></blockquote><br><br>What i posted <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2933283#p2933283\" class=\"postlink\">here</a> is still valid. He was on all 3 early bandwagons, and late to boot. If you take my word for my alignment, all 3 of these early day 1 bandwagons he pushed were on townies. This is even worse now that we know the flips.<br><br>Valern also seemed to have weird reads on Lucresia. I get the vibe that he knew she was town by the way he posted during day 1, but I'm having a hard time qualifying this read. However, he definitely did seem to know Quilford would flip town despite my fairly solid case on him, and equally despite Quilford's severe lack of defense.<br><br>Valern played day 4 perfectly. He pushed my lynch, and declared Quilford town. If Quilford gets lynched, he gets town cred and has an easier time pushing my lynch. If I get lynched instead of Quilford, suddenly I flip town and Valern goes back and says \"Oh wow, I guess he must have been right after all!\" and wins the game with the Quilford lynch, especially considering how much clout there was on his lynch.<br><br>I'd also like to note that DRK was the NK. Now obviously she was unlynchable, but she had the more solid stance that I'm town (at the end of day 4) compared to Ranger. Scum Valern would obviously take the player most interested in my lynch in to lylo. Scum ICE would have pushed harder for Valern being scum day 4 to convince DRK to shoot Valern.<br><br>Additionally, most of the reason for lynching me today seems to be about my not having been on any of the scum wagons. Recall that I was the one who asked inHim to claim, obviously showing intents to hammer. I also showed intents to hammer crazy, as well. Both hammers fell too quickly for me to do the honors. That isn't my fault.<br><br>While it isn't that strong of a defense, it's something: most of the now dead townies had a town read on me.<br><br>Finally, I apparently got a lot of town cred for accidentally pointing out that I have no night activity when I was prodded. Everyone seems to have forgotten about that."}

This was especially true days 2 and 3. During the time we were lynching scum, Ice was barely involved in the game. He wasn't on the bandwagons, even if he did express his willingness to hammer, but he also wasn't pushing alternate theories. Admittedly, pushing other wagons hard while scum is on the chopping block can be a big scum tell, but if a scum was hoping his partners wouldn't get lynched, but didn't want to draw attention to himself if they did, sitting in the background would be a much more subtle way to do it.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>ICEninja wrote:</cite>I will be setting aside time tomorrow to made a case.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Ranger wrote:</cite>Ice insisted a couple of times yesterday that he didn't think Crazy would have self-hammered without the last scum on the wagon.

From his first post:<br><blockquote><div><cite>Valern wrote:</cite>Why was I prodded? -.-</div></blockquote><br>Less than 24 hours after day 1 had started. Is it possible he hadn't posted in the scum QT for awhile? Sure. I actually noticed this yesterday while I was re-reading all of Valern's posts, and it was one of things that made me think he probably wasn't scum. You could easily have noticed that both Valern and Trendall claimed to have been prodded right after the game started, looked at the rules, figured out what it meant, and posted your claim to have been prodded in order to capitalize on that reason. Otherwise, I'm really not sure why you posted to inform us that you had been prodded during day 2, but not during day 1."}

Even day 4, you didn't consider that I might be scum. There were a couple of times when Ice pointed out things like Crazy's self hammer and the prod notices that applied to both you and him, but not to me. Crazy DIDN'T self-hammer before his scum-buddy was on the wagon, and Ice made that point exactly, but neither of you ever applied it to me. Both of you had received prods right as the day started and I never had, but only Ice applied that to me, and only after I basically pointed it out.<br><br>I'm really not entirely sure why you and Ice and even DRK had such a strong town read on me, but I took advantage of it. Bussing crazy probably helped a lot, but it seemed pretty likely he was going down that day anyway, and I started the bandwagon on him because it seemed inevitable.<br><br>Scum QT is <a href=\"http://www.quicktopic.com/46/H/iXpPVDakAATw\" class=\"postlink\">here.</a>"}
