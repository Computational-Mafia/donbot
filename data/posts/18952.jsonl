Tonight, each of you shall take part in a wonderful game where the winners shall all receive a prize of untold riches! Each of you gathered here has received, along with your invitations, the role in which you shall play in this dinner mystery performance! Rest assured, all expenses have been taken care of by our gracious host, so please, relax, and enjoy your stay here while the game is in session!<br>\n<br>\nFurther instructions have been provided for you to follow, and you will be wise to look them over and abide by them during the course of this game.</div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">1) General Rules</div></div><br>\n1a. This is a game, and sportsmanlike conduct is expected. I will not tolerate personal attacks. This is your only warning.<br>\n1b. I am the moderator of this game, and as such, I will decide what to do in any given situation.<br>\n1c. That said I am not infallible. If there are ever any error(s) you notice, please contact me via PM with the error(s) and I will see to it they will be dealt with.<br>\n1d. I also reserve the right to amend or add onto the rules if the need for so arises. Any changes that may/may not be made will be made public when they occur.<br>\n1e. <div style=\"display:inline;color:#800000\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">This is my font type; as such, using it is against the rules.</div></div></div><br>\n1f. If you wish to address the game mod during play, you may either PM me or post in the thread; if you post in thread your post must be bolded, and start with \"@MOD:\" or I may miss it.<br>\n1g. I reserve the right to force-replace a player at my own digression, and if I am required to mod-kill a player, their role shall be changed to \"Neutral-Survivor,\" and they shall lose the game.<br>\n1h. In the event of a mod-kill, the game shall proceed automatically to the next game phase.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">2) Activity and Gameplay</div></div><br>\n2a.

A person who is not on V/LA and has not posted within 3 days of their latest post shall be prodded by me.<br>\n2c. If a player does not respond to a prod within 4 days of being prodded, they will be forcibly replaced.<br>\n2d. I will only prod each player twice. On the third required prodding, the player shall instead be forcibly replaced.<br>\n2e. Unless otherwise stated in your role PM, you are <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">NOT</div> allowed to privately communicate with other players outside of the game thread.<br>\n2f. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">DO NOT</div> quote any discussions you may have with the moderator of the game, whether in text or picture format. Doing so will result in a mod-kill and your role being changed to \"neutral-survivor\" and forfeiting the game.<br>\n2g. Encrypted, invisible, or small/hard to read text is <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">NOT</div> allowed.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">3) Voting</div></div><br>\n3a.

Unvoting is not required, but highly appreciated. To unvote, you may post in bold \"Unvote,\" or use the unvote tags.<br>\n3e. A lynch will occur when there are a majority of players voting for a person to be lynched. If no majority is reached by deadline, then no-lynch will occur.<br>\n3f. No-Lynch is an acceptable vote as well.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">4) Deadlines</div></div><br>\n4a.

I might go back and use that, though, because they looked pretty funny in their costumes and I think you might really like them! Although, you might ask Rarity about costumes, since she knows ALL about clothes and stuff. <br>\n<br>\nI also wanted to point out to theamateur that you might THINK you're safe from all this love, but your avatar is a pony too! :3 <br>\n<br>\nThe Princess is waiting for an avatar from me too. I made it and then told her I'd upload it and then I forgot and fell asleep!

I've never done it before, and I hate when other people do it. <br>\n<br>\nWhiskers, I appreciate that you have made some substantive contributions to the game, but I resent having to sift through a load of pony crap to get to it. I also resent that this is what I'm spending my time thinking and talking about rather than digging for scum tells. My problem with the pony speak and role playing isn't that I hate My Little Pony or role playing (I've got a shelf full of D&amp;D books). It's that indulging in pony speak and role playing is very clearly resulting in less clarity and concision in certain players' posts, which hurts the town, period. It makes it harder to find scum tells, it makes it harder to analyze points, and it's distracting. I understand that you all are having fun with it, and I don't have a problem with that necessarily, but it's not what I signed up for when I signed up for a mini-normal game, which are explicitly unthemed. I'm a little different than most players on this site in that I only play in one game at a time, and I try my best to be committed and focused on that game. I'm not sure I want this to be the one game I play for the next few months. At the same time, I don't want to spoil the fun of the half dozen or so of you who enjoy talking like cartoon ponies. You're entitled to play the game how you want, although I'd suggest that you might have been better off setting up a theme game if that's the kind of game you were looking for. <br>\n<br>\nSo the bottom line is, I'm not digging the pony talk, but I don't want to be the guy that poops on your pony talk party, so I don't feel like I can ask you to stop. I'm considering allowing a few RL days to pass and see if I get used to the pony speak, but based on how much it is irritating me atm and how counterproductive I think it is, I think that's pretty unlikely. Sorry to keep bitching about it, but there it is.

Most ponies even tend to enjoy it after a while if they let themselves, although it coming from half the game may be quite the culture shock.  The speak, pictures for emotion emphisis at times, I do agree that being too far out there in roleplay is a bad thing, and Whiskers I can tell will definantly hoof that line in this game.

I digress though.<br>\n<br>\n@monk - You need to explain your vote on amature better.  I suddenly got a whole lot more nervous about that wagon when you added the vote, backed down on the core point the vote seemed to come from and the vote continued to remain.<br>\n<br>\n@amature - If you think that tarson is scummier than Gutherie, you should vote him and say why.  Although I still think tarson is slightly more likely town for leaving the town alliance choice in my hooves instead of his.  Very gustsy move if she is scum.  Just do not see scum giving town the reigns so willingly.<br>\n<br>\n@Whiskers - I am sorta serious about the need to eventually get stuff done.  Remember the parasprites?  You were yourself there definantly, but you still got the job done.  You just have to apply the same concepts here and we will be all good.  For the non-MLP ponies, parasprites are some locust like creature that apparently can only be driven out of the town by music which only Whiskers-Pinkie Pie knew but no pony took her seriously because of the randomness that she always has but it worked out in the end and she helped save Ponyville.  I will do my best to explain all of her analogies throughout the game, since she apparently is the only pony here who can rival my knowledge of the show.<br>\n<br>\nContinuing though Whiskers, try and roleplay so that you are still able to get stuff done.  This may be more natural to me, given my more brash and headstrong personality.  That translates better to getting stuff done here, but I think you somehow can apply your, whatever it is you do, personality to the game.

Oh well.<br>\n<br>\nThamature really never responded to any points against, him and monk did a really good job of laying out just about everything right there.  To make a more concise case that leans away from PBPA though, here is some food for thought:<br>\n<br>\nNothing has ever really been responded too in the whole early trolling vote exchange.<br>\n<br>\nEarly there is what appears to be deflection of trolling from himself to ABR, and when pressed on that he immediately says that ABR was not scummy for what he was doing and instead Gutherie was voting for a bad reason.  Gutherie isn't scummy though to theamature, which is where I stop understanding things.  It essentially means that theamature tried to move a vote from himself from a null pony to a null pony instead of addressin what he considered to be weak reasoning for a vote.  This doesn't really mesh with what I consider to be a town mindset, since its far more concerned with having votes on somepony else instead of trying to convince somepony that their logic is flawed.<br>\n<br>\nI really dislike his stance against town alliance as well.  Even if we decide to ignore my read on tarin being town which I still agree with, and given where these attack are coming from is being strengthened, its the fundamental idea of trying to stop a group of ponies from coming together.  When you look at the fact that I already was showing suspicion of theamature at the point the alliance was brought up, it may be more valid here.<br>\n<br>\nIm at a loss for why he is voting monk at this point really too.  He called monk town back in 155, but moved his vote back based of thinking that tarin was scum with him.

Whiskers needs to have a little bit of a reign on her if we are going to actually make it through this game, and if I need to keep telling her that and comparing what she is doing to what I feel a more efficient style of roleplay is, then I will keep going through with it.<br>\n<br>\nTarin and the town reads again fall into the same boat.  I have to keep defending her against ponies who have problems with any type of an alliance being made, since I view the way she threw out the idea as townish instead of ill intentioned.  Just can't see scum putting something like that in town hooves, ponies jumping on me for it just backs up this feeling.  This all loops back into my town reads, which as I have elluded to are most of the wagon on monk a little bit ago, you and Gutherie I definantly think are town at this point, and to a lesser extent, Beck, Tarin and subgenius I all have town reads on.  I would nearly be willing to swing three pony alliance at this stage already.<br>\n<br>\nIm not one to back down from a point.

Somepony else-- subgenius, I think, maybe, brought up that he believes there to also probably be a third party-- it's just common enough in these games that it's not unlikely here. <br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>monk wrote:</cite>Your linking of me and theAmatuer is so tenuous, surely if we were scum together and one of us thought there was a SK it would have come up in the pregame scumchat <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3403568#p3403568\" class=\"postlink\">#215</a></div></blockquote>Good point.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>monk wrote:</cite>That's it for pre-#223, however this stuff has come out afterwards as well. <br>\n<br>\nFrom <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3404603#p3404603\" class=\"postlink\">#290</a> onwards you don't answer a simple question, sure you do in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3405313#p3405313\" class=\"postlink\">#319</a> but it shouldn't be that hard to get out of you and in any case looks incredibly scummy, why did you want the joy of hammering?</div></blockquote>A couple of things here: If I just out and <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">say</div> \"Why, I was waiting for somepony else to vote and put theamateur at L-1, then I would hammer him!\" It would have prevented that thing from occurring. <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>monk wrote:</cite>You have also been a passive player throughout the whole game: <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3403158#p3403158\" class=\"postlink\">#195</a> <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3403568#p3403568\" class=\"postlink\">#215</a> <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3405973#p3405973\" class=\"postlink\">#333</a></div></blockquote>I won't agrue about that, but none of those three posts are examples of me being a passive player-- these are, all three of them, examples of my playing. The first I was joining a pressure wagon and asking the Mod to murder a stupid asshole (aka, lurker), the second I was putting pressure on theamateur and trying to get him to claim SK or something. Pushing for a reaction. The third, I was answering a question that was asked of me, explaining something I had recently said further, and asking a question of my own. <br>\nThese aren't even misreps, it's just pulling some quotes off of my ISO at random and applying some arguments  you have to them.

I see it, I can sorta get your reasoning since she was a little choppy in regards to the thamataure wagon which I actually moved my vote to her for a little due to, but look at the recent play from her.  That is town motivation all the way since it would require a sudden wagon to show on Whiskers to have any chance of survival essentially since monk was suddenly arguing against the main counter wagon to herself.  Scum talking themselves into a corner like that?  Very rare.  Also you have Whiskers and Theamature who both are nearly for sure NOT scum with monk making very odd moves in regard to that wagon, which just continues to make me think monk is town.<br>\n<br>\nIf you are just going to continue to push on monk, at least tell me why I am wrong in the specific quotes I addressed regarding monk.  You say its a scum tell in a few, but to be a scum tell it would need to actually benifit scum, which I do not see as really happening.  Something that makes no sense from town standpoint is not always going to be scumtell unless it benifits scum, if it benifits neither, or arugeably barely benifits a side, its null.  Attempting to lable null tells scum tells is in itself a slight tell, and is usually a sign of a forming mislynch.<br>\n<br>\nTarin is also town, I mean what is the case on her?  Something like<br>\n1) Tried to start an alliance<br>\n2) Lurky?<br>\n3) Recent vote<br>\n<br>\nIf anything the only applicable point is the third one, and I think the voting location track record from Tarin has actually been quite good if you remove the ABR vote which I still think is a stupid wagon when it was at its mini-peak.  Again, the alliance thing was a town tell to me, even if Tarin is scum here, it gives me control over a chunk of votes.  Something I can't see scum doing willingly like that, especially since as I have said, Tarin has seen me play and knows I can read ponies pretty well.  She isn't lurking either, this is what, four life days into the game?  This game is <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">fast</div>.  She is keeping up with the game and her read changes feel very natural.  Not to mention the wagon that popped up on her is two scum reads and only one town read.  I think Gutherie is just bucking up the wrong tree, but when the two ponies I am most interested in start the wagon, I know where im going to stand in all of this.<br>\n<br>\nI will defend these two ponies all day if I have to.  Whiskers case up later tonight or tomorrow probably.<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://www.ponychan.net/chan/pic/src/131256637718.gif\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"><br>\n<br>\nDash got their backs.", "time": "Tue Sep 06, 2011 9:59 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=18952&start=450", "forum": "53", "thread": "18952"}

Whiskers goes on to make a strikingly similar case to what Taris is pushing on him right now, for not contributing and slightly trolling.

I really am not seeing theamature-monk as a team, and this post implies that monk is town, since that is the only way I could see a theamature flip.  When you combine with with the fact that I already have a town read on monk due to recent play not making any sense from scum, and please whatever pony is saying WIFOM just analyse what the benifits of making that move possibly could be.  That post from Whiskers really sounds like explicit expectation of monk flipping town.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Actually, I was keeping my vote off tarson too, to avoid accusations of OMGUS and a speedy Whiskers-lynch. </div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nShowing more concern with self-image then with voting who she says her top picks actually are.  Not to mention the really bad reasoning behind the tarson wagon already.  According to Whiskers, the entire case on Tarin seems to be active lurking, which she obviously is not.  She is not making a large number of posts, but there is a daily contribution that some ponys are passing off as sheeping, but you need to realize in that about 100 hours we have had three different ponies reach L-2.

If I didn't think there was any chance monk is scum, I wouldn't be considering voting for him.<br>\n<br>\nI'd be hard pressed to find good pro-town play from most players in this game, and monk is no exception. I just don't think there's a good case on him. My money is on town vs town, because your interaction with monk has the long, repetitive arguments that often seem to show up between two town players. If one of you were scum, I'd expect a more serious scum tell to drop at some point. For a time, I thought you were possibly bussing monk, but I've since decided against that possibility. As far as my read on you, I don't think your tunneling is productive. I might even go so far as to call it anti-town, but I think it's townie behavior. As far as monk goes, I just don't see any reason to think he's scum. You keep talking about scum tells, and I understand what you're referring to, but I don't see them as smoking guns at all. You'll just have to accept that some people don't agree with your case. I don't have any specific town tells except a general gut feeling that he's doing his best to be productive in a game that has a lot of borderline incoherent posting.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Beck wrote:</cite>Sub- after you post my request on monk, give me your reads on Charlie and Guthrie.</div></blockquote><br>\nCharlie: Tough to read, too few posts to form a strong read, but I will say that I don't think the justifications for his votes has been particularly strong. He has the excuse of posting from a handheld device, but that won't be acceptable indefinitely. Rereading his ISO, I notice that his vote for you (Beck) was because it agreed with his previous scum list, but he never explained his scum list, meaning he never explained his vote. He's one of the players that I'm quite suspicious of, but haven't seen anything overtly scummy.

After hearing the debacle over the intruders, all of the guests attending were restless. Throughout the night, several guests could be found resting in the lobby, too uneasy to sleep in their own rooms. Several guests would even go into the rooms of other guests, hoping that the company of another would bring them solstice and comfort through the night.<br>\n<br>\nThe host, resting in his private rooms, contemplated the events that had transpired over the course of the day. This affair had brought a great deal of stress on him, and he was worried that soon his own guests would turn against one another from the threats made by the mysterious group of burglars. But, such a minor threat would not be able to best him, so he began to contemplate what events should be held for the following day..<br>\n<br>\nAs the sun rose, and daylight crept in through the windows, the guests all gathered in the large dining hall for the morning buffet. The host stood at the head of the table, and prepared a toast for everyone.<br>\n<br>\n&#8220;I trust everyone has slept well? I have planned many a great event for this morning, and many more surprises for the rest of the day. Now, is everyone here? I have an announcement to make.&#8221;<br>\n<br>\nA voice chimed out from the crowd<br>\n<br>\n&#8220;Albert and subgenius are not here sir.&#8221;<br>\n<br>\n&#8220;Well, can someone please go to their rooms and wake them? This is something everyone should hear,&#8221; said the host. One of the maids and several guests left the dining hall.<br>\n<br>\nA few minutes passed as the host addressed the guests, warning them not to let the threatening letter discourage them from enjoying their time at the estate. He assured them that the matter would be handled properly, and that no further harm would come to his guests. As he was coming to the conclusion of his speech, a man came running in through the door. Beads of sweat were running down his face, and he was out of breath.<br>\n&#8220;They&#8217;re dead, they&#8217;re both dead!&#8221; he cried out. The room fell silent..<br>\n</div></div>", "time": "Tue Sep 20, 2011 2:17 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=18952&start=950", "forum": "53", "thread": "18952"}

All of them tried to enjoy themselves, but lurking in the back of everyone&#8217;s minds, the thought of the murders lingered. After the police came through and gathered testimonies from everyone, they assured them that the situation would be taken care of, and to put it out of their minds.<br>\n<br>\nThe host, however, was uneasy. The entire day&#8217;s plans were starting to fall apart. The performers he originally hired to act out a Shakespearean play had almost refused to put on their play before he offered to triple their pay. The afternoon circus wasn&#8217;t faring any better, as the ringmaster was refusing to perform without having his own payment increased as well.<br>\n<br>\nAll the stress started to wear on the host. However, he still had confidence in his guests to maintain composure and that tonight, dinner would go without any incidents. At the same time, he couldn&#8217;t help but feel a foreboding sense of terror..<br>\n<br>\n&#8220;Ladies and gentlemen, I welcome you once again to dinner this evening,&#8221; he started with.  &#8220;A fine assortment of foods and drinks have been prepared for all of you to enjoy, graciously provided for you tonight free of charge, as you all deserve nothing less!&#8221;<br>\n<br>\nA quiet applause rippled throughout the room. It lasted for a few seconds, but soon all but faded away. However, in the back of the room, one person leaning against the wall continued clap slowly, more slow than everyone had before.<br>\n<br>\n&#8220;You&#8217;re full of it, old man,&#8221; the figure started. &#8220;You know just as well as I do that you&#8217;re terrified for your life here.&#8221;<br>\n<br>\n&#8220;How dare you insult the host?!&#8221; cried out a voice sitting at the table. &#8220;Tarson, you had better explain yourself!&#8221; The room became full with chatter.<br>\n<br>\n&#8220;Oh, I will,&#8221; he started, with a grin on his face. &#8220;This old fool? he&#8217;s terrified. He&#8217;s just putting up a show for you, so you don&#8217;t realize we&#8217;re all doomed!&#8221;<br>\n<br>\nMaxwell stood up from the table, walked over to tarson, then punched him across the face. Tarson stumbled backwards, then returned with a punch of his own. The rest of the guests rushed to pull the two apart. All the while the host stood at the end of the table awestruck.<br>\n<br>\nStruggling to get free, Tarson continued to try to punch and kick and bite his way free, shouting obscenities all the while. During the commotion, a slip of paper fell out from his waistcoat pocket. One of the female guests reached down to pick up the paper, then shouted when she finished reading it.<br>\n<br>\n&#8220;What is it?&#8221; asked Charlie.<br>\n<br>\n&#8220;The note, it says that he&#8217;s going to kill someone else tonight!&#8221; Everyone froze and stared at tarson. He flailed his arms and broke free, then turned and pulled out a gun and waved it around. He swung it around, moving from person to person, spinning in place.<br>\n<br>\n&#8220;Stay back,&#8221; he yelled, &#8220;or I&#8217;ll start shooting!&#8221; His expression was panicked, his hands were shaking, and he was laughing uncontrollably. &#8220;Stay away from me!&#8221;<br>\n<br>\nBang.<br>\n<br>\nTarson fell to the ground, a red hole appearing in his chest. The host stood at the end of the room, a pistol gripped tightly in his hands.. He started to crawl away, but Charlie reached down and grabbed Tarson&#8217;s pistol.<br>\n<br>\nHe fired another round into tarson&#8217;s head, and he was dead.<br>\n</div></div>", "time": "Tue Sep 20, 2011 11:00 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=18952&start=1000", "forum": "53", "thread": "18952"}

The host, after the meal, alerted the authorities to the incident. The body was loaded into an ambulance, statements were taken, and soon after everyone went to bed.<br>\n<br>\nAgain, the host contemplated in his study, pondering the next day&#8217;s events. After the incident the night before, the magician he had originally hired to perform refused to put on his show, and left soon after midnight. The host was not worried, for he had several other avenues of entertainment lined up, but for tonight, he wanted to rest easy. While one of the intruders was found and killed, there were still more. He could not be sure how many remained, but progress was progress.<br>\n<br>\nIn the bar, several guests could be seen, conversing with one another. The band playing was performing a slow jazz tune. Other guests were in their rooms, or in the rooms of other guests, amusing themselves in various forms of entertainment..<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nThe next morning, the host walked down to the bar to meet with his bartender, find out how things went the night before. He said everything was going well, but that there was a stench coming from the bathroom.<br>\n<br>\nAs he walked to the bathroom door, scotch in hand, the smell grew more and more noticeable, until it became almost unbearable. He knocked on the door, but as he did it swung open. Inside, the body of Maxwell could be found lying in a pool of blood on the floor. A notepad and pen were clenched in each of his hands, with a broken cell phone at his feet.<br>\n<br>\nThe host stumbled backwards, and looked to the bartender. He told him to alert the authorities, but the bartender looked back at him with a grimace. The host knew immediately what was wrong.<br>\n<br>\nSeveral guests stormed into the room, some still wearing pajamas. Their faces showed expressions of surprise, fear, and sorrow.<br>\n<br>\n&#8220;Sir, monk was found dead in his room!&#8221; cried out one of the maids. The host stumbled to his feet, then calmly walked over to the bar.<br>\n<br>\n&#8220;Get me the police, and another scotch,&#8221; he said with a heavy tone.

I was convinced at that point that theamateur was likely enough to be scum, that I was ready to hammer him. Since town is a big pussy and wasn't willing to hammer him (he was at L-1), I put him at L-2, hoping somepony else would put him BACK at L-1, and I'd hammer him FTW. <br>\nThen ThAdmiral came on and posted a case why he WASN'T Scum, which made me reconsider. <br>\n<br>\nLATER, I voted for theamatuer, because the Day Needed to End. Fuck you, \"no no in mafia\" my ass. You voted three times all game. <br>\nAll day one, you voted three times: <br>\n#15 (6) Rampage. <br>\n#109 (14) <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">fos</div> Tarson. <br>\n#167 (21) monk. <br>\n#315 (40) Tarson. <br>\n#322 (44) monk. <br>\n#539 (105) Rampage. <br>\n#614 (114) monk. <br>\n#659 (131) Rampage. <br>\n#735 (160) monk. <br>\n<br>\nSo at least I put my neck out there and pressured players. You tunneled on one player for percieved scumtells (ignoring any evidence to the contrary-- see GLaDOS for more on that)), occasionally nudged another, somewhat-scummy-looking, incredibly jerkass player, and touched on Tarsonisocelot ONCE. MINOR DISTANCING? <br>\n<br>\nBtw, how do you even get \"tarson is 100% scum\" from VCA? I looked (#962) and I don't get it.  <br>\n<br>\nFrom this, I could say that you've only ever seriously voted for townies, or say that you've voted for townies 66% of the time (75% now, now that you've also voted me). <br>\n<br>\nRainbow Dash having voted for various people doesn't make her scum. Jesus christ. Why is it a scumtell?<br>\n<br>\nThen you've got GLaDOS, who \"was on\" three different wagons. So? You voted Three different times.

This one is a flash game with Rainbow Dash playing any note you want her to on her guitar (like the song Clocks by Coldplay, for instance. Awesome).<br>\n<br>\nAnyway.<br>\n<br>\nNotice that she is staring directly at you, the reader. Also, the fact that the animated form of her gets wingboners as she plays the guitar does not help.

While I know you are Rarity and such, you are less obviously a pony through talk, more like me our distinction is simply ponyspeak, and for me picutres.  I think Thad is significantly less likely to be scum then you due to the early Mist vote.  When you tack on that Mist stayed away from your wagon, and instead jumped at me, with you now seeming to balk a bit at where to move your vote, I think the team is you and Mist, with Mist being far more likely.<br>\n<br>\nIf Mist is town, probably its close between you and Thad, since it would have to be one of Charlie/Thad and one of GLaDOS/Whiskers.  Interestingly enough I would almost think Thad since I can't see Charlie-GLaDOS/Whiskers really working here.  So I would have to lean by default Thad, but something about that just makes me feel pretty uncomfortable at this point since it means my town reads are off.  It more or less just backs up my current read of Mist being scum.<br>\n<br>\nAgain what is with these pointless questions?

She didn't want to lynch Mister Albert, an obviously scummy player. A player who was capable fully of playing better than he did I guess he did it to draw the nightkill? which worked? Still, I'd have liked to have been on his wagon when he was LYNCHED, not killed. <br>\nCurrently, I am suspicious of Rainbowdash for being the only unknown in a voting block of one scum and one town. Two scum buddy up and pick a gullible townie to buddy with? Call it a town voting block? Sure. <br>\nThis is subject to wifom and shit. Guilt by association, and I certainly can't tell you it's real. As usual, Rainbowdash remains a null-strong Town read to me. <br>\n<br>\nmonk. bad play and self contradictions. Both pointed out by Beck. Was also hard on theamateur, who was a town read for me. she was Beck's main and only suspect. Beck is pretty good as town, and had been a STRONG town read for MOST of Day 1. I wasn't confident of monkscum either. I was more sure than theamateurscum, but I was also sheeping Beck. I didn't see it super clearly myself. <br>\nWhy Beck (who laid out most of my info on monk) is scummy now: He tunneled monk so hard D1 that he was left with nopony to accuse. monk was pretty strong, it seems, and at the very least had Rainbowdash backing her up all the time-- therefore, a great lynch to <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">keep</div> pushing, even harder, and harder, and h<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">harder</div>, because you know why? Scum doesn't want to lynch who they say is scum. Saying somepony who is unlikely to be lynched is scum is a great tactic. <br>\nAlso, the bit about not killing monk is wifom. The major problem here is that he's an uncc'd vig, with an obvious secondary killing role. Town Beck and  Lonely Serial Killer Beck wouldn't make that monk kill, unless he's an SK sided with the mafia somehow, this doesn't make sense. Strong scum gut-feeling, but no good way for him to possibly be scum. <br>\n<br>\nAlbert B. Rampage. What do I need to say about him? I wish he'd been bitten by a snake and replaced out, but he didn't. Was he trying to draw the nightkill? apparently. I know <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">I</div> wouldn't have killed him. I didn't see him as/didn't know/didn't care him as a Power Role, either. He was being a douche and since I said his play might be a scum gambit, it was ind of inviting him to come and play, now that he wouldn't be NK'd (because I called himj scummy, and keeping scummy players around is good for scum). <br>\n<br>\nRainbowdash and \"needs to Scootabus harder\"-- monk being the player I, at the time, wanted to lynch (at least over theamateur), I was saying Rainbowdash should stop defending her and vote for her instead. Turns out the wagon thing was Town x Town wagons, so all of you with town reads on one or the other were right about that. I had confused town reads on both, but they were the largest wagons, so there you go. <br>\n<br>\nThis adequate?", "time": "Tue Sep 27, 2011 6:04 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=18952&start=1100", "forum": "53", "thread": "18952"}

They likely only changed back and said the other was scum because of all the pressure for the town v town thing-- ie, fos: Beck, and I'll check the back and forth on that later).

It was very well disguised fluff. I define active lurking as posting short, useless posts, but posting them often enough to not be called a lurker.

It appears as though you were saying because it is a fast-paced game, she is not active lurking?

It was very well disguised fluff. I define active lurking as posting short, useless posts, but posting them often enough to not be called a lurker.

This was a REALLY fast change to, in a thirty minute period Guth says that he likes his Tarson vote, followed by theamature/Whiskers moving to Tarson, to Guth FoSing both.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nGuth wasn't the first to do so, but did point out a serious inconsistency in #307. Others agreed, but Beck stepped in to challenge this. FoS Beck. As a matter of fact, Beck throws down a weak tarsonis vote, in 315, and retracts it just a few posts later in 322 almost without reason. Guthrie started on tarsonis, before nearly everyone else when there was little attention on tarsonis, #307, then MANY POSTS LATER, #451 throws down a serious vote. This is after developments on tarsonis, and Whiskers' posts. <br>\n<br>\nNot the meatiest logic, but he's going by what has been implied, and the scumvibes tarsonis is giving, + voting for an innocent player, and obvious bandwagoning. Theamateur, 100% town agreed AND Whiskers comes in as well. He has started a wagon, and is SATISFIED. He's happy with the vote, and guth FoS's whiskers for \"trying to save his ass.\" This isn's suspicious in any way. Why is FoSing amateur scummy? Did you actually read? Because both of their votes had slight scum motivations. Obviously, not anymore because tarsonis was mafia.

I've posted the evidence of this, and this especially, RIGHT AFTER a wagon was forming, you tried hard to squash it. Whiskers AND beth say that tarsonis IS activelurking, wtfbro, and you defend tarsonis AGAIN. in #472. Not just one sentence responses, but repeated sentences.

Why do you always downplay townie actions of others, and downplay the scumminess of tarsonis?<br>\n<br>\nTarsonis had been active lurking, and you did an excellent job in downplaying a scumlynch. Let's compare this to your case on Guthrie... <br>\n<br>\nThe best you've got on me is that tarsonis barely mentioned guthrie? Well, guthrie barely posted for one thing, and the other stuff would have been tarsonis quoting posts that put her in a bad light while other wagons were going on. <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=3472973#p3472973\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=3472973#p3472973\" data-post-id=\"3472973\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 1091</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=16488\">Rainbowdash</a> wrote:</cite><br>\nOther things from Guthiere<br>\n<br>\nHe was part of the late D1 push on ABR for policy, which I still say has to has to be one of the worst wagons out there, and I would be stunned if only Tarson hopped on it as scum, especially with scum apparently killing ABR the first night.

Now, let's get down to business.<br>\n*puts on librarian glasses*<br>\n...<br>\nI do not understand what's going on in this thread.<br>\nLet me clarify:<br>\n<br>\n1) I don't understand why Applejack still hasn't caught up yet. It has been a while and I always give everypony the benefit of the doubt whenever they are in 'catch-up mode' and I'm still going to do just that. Get caught up soon, my dear.<br>\n2) I don't understand what Whiskers is rambling about. Perhaps you really do have a Pinkie Pie personality (of hyperactive/ADHD type). This is not an insult, it is an opinion.<br>\n3) I don't understand what in Equestria is Rainbowdash doing. I do have reserved opinions about this pony but I really want to... no, need to, get Applejack's opinions out there on the table first. See, I'm quite convinced of these:<br>\ni) ThAdmiral is Mafia<br>\nii) One of Applejack/Rainbowdash is Mafia<br>\niii) Whiskers is a wildcard:- she has such an erratic behavior which I can see Whiskers-Mafia make, but it seems.... too easy.<br>\n<br>\nI need to validate ii) but it does not work with a one way conversation. I need everypony to lay their cards on the table before the magic of scumhunting by discussion will work. In the meantime, everypony (including you, Rainbowdash) go ISO Rainbowdash and take a good look at the posts she made in twilight. See if it makes sense.<br>\n<br>\n4) I don't understand why ThAdmiral-Mafia isn't pushing harder for my lynch. But then again, I can't forsee what ThAdmiral-Mafia's strategy is. Oh well, doesn't really matter.<br>\n<br>\nI... am also confused about some other thing, but I'll ask about it after the game is over.<br>\n<br>\nOh, and on side note, everypony go watch Lesson Zero.

At this point I've convinced that ThAdmiral is Mafia given the fact that there hasn't been a quickhammer already. That being the case, I'll be looking into who is most likely his partner + interactions with tarsonisocelot. If you're Town, don't hold back on saying what's on your mind; I'll scrutinize it.

I'd compare the actions/opinions of both but I keep finding my Applejack notes empty. I can say loads of stuff about Rainbowdash, but not Applejack and I'm fearful that if it turns out that it is Applejack-Mafia, then I'm being played as a tool.

I still have town reads of Whiskers and Rainbowdash for essentially the same reasons I've stated already in the thread, and I would have sworn my life on them except Rainbowdash brought up something really interesting about the Charlie-ThAdmiral pair earlier in the Day. If Rainbowdash is town, Mist Beauty's accusations over twilight would have made it easy for scum to put Rainbowdash up as an option in LyLo, but instead we have Charlie and ThAdmiral going at each other's throats. Granted, the two of them were already doing it as the Day was ending, but the justification that Mist Beauty gave was pretty big.

I'll also take a gander at the voting spreadsheet to see if there's anything interesting there; I refuse to look at another VCA, though. Unfortunately, the NKs were mostly on power roles; Albert B. Rampage's soft claiming means I will not be able to determine if he was killed for his reads, his status in the game, or his soft claim, so I'm not happy about that.<br>\n<br>\nFor the record, I would have voted ThAdmiral. I agree with Whiskers that his suggestion that Beck shoot regardless of how Mist Beauty flipped was reckless. It's one thing to trust the kill to someone who is 100% town, but Beck was not going to have anything to keep him in check during the Night phase; when the game is decided by a group, the composition of the group isn't guaranteed, but there's less chance of the townies in the group screwing up due to checks and balances. This probably makes more sense in my head than written, but that's how I see it. Furthermore, Beck made it clear that he wanted to shoot Whiskers; if Whiskers is town -- and that's my belief at the moment -- ThAdmiral is scum for making this suggestion to Beck.<br>\n<br>\nBut I'm going to wait until I clear up the matter in the first paragraph before I make a final Applejack decision.", "time": "Sat Oct 22, 2011 2:58 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=18952&start=1450", "forum": "53", "thread": "18952"}

I think that Charlie is scum but the reaction from Thad makes me thing thats not the pairing since they easily could have turned it into me vs Thad today without a whole lot of an issue I think.

Charlie was on record going after ThAdmiral in the event of a Mist Beauty-town flip, and ThAdmiral was on record going after Charlie in the event of a Mist Beauty-town flip. If either of them tried to go for Rainbowdash as soon as Day 4 started, there was a chance of someone noticing this; that chance was higher than usual given that I was still catching up, and I'd have a fresh perspective on the game. Therefore, they could have gone for consistency and bussed each other. The upside to this is that if either of them got lynched -- it's LyLo after all -- the other would suddenly be \"confirmed town,\" and Whiskers goes down because she's the pony nobody else really suspects.<br>\n<br>\nI've stated over and over again how strong my Rainbowdash read is. The natural conclusion would be to just vote one of Charlie and ThAdmiral and be over with. The reason I haven't done so is because I'm still afraid of the possibility that Rainbowdash has the wool over my eyes. One of my greatest weaknesses in Mafia is that I am easily manipulated with WIFOM-type gambits; the reason I so strongly believe that Rainbowdash is town is itself due to WIFOM. I saw what tarsonisocelot was doing with Rainbowdash; the princess gave Rainbowdash the reins to a voting bloc, etc. Go back in my iso if you want this in more detail, since I can't be assed to rewrite the whole thing again. In summary, it paints a giant target on Rainbowdash's back.<br>\n<br>\nBut I am fearful enough of Rainbowdash's ability as scum. Since tarsonisocelot went and announced that she'd start a voting bloc before the game ever started, there was a possibility that she brought it up in her QuickTopic. If Rainbowdash is scum with her, I can definitely see Rainbowdash planning all of this out and manipulating the wine.<br>\n<br>\nThis is why I want to actually read certain things in the thread closer. There is so much wine swimming in my head right now, and I need to read these players much closer than I have while blitzing through this thread. This is LyLo; I am not going to decide a game while I'm drunk on possibilities and not sober on actual, solid reads of people. All I've got on ThAdmiral despite 59 pages of game is something about suggesting that Beck shoot. Don't get me starting on the blank nothing with microscopic dust bunnies that is Charlie.

Asking questions is difficult when I'm finding my hoof in contact to my face most of the time.<br>\n<br>\n------------<br>\n<br>\nOK, I'll let everypony in on a little secret. The whole point of waiting for Applejack to catch up was to see if she commits an IIoF (Information Instead of Analysis) tell, one scumtell which I find best used on replacements entering late game (based on personal experience). This didn't work because Whiskers pointed out all the key points in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3529293#p3529293\" class=\"postlink\">#1414</a> of which Applejack should have analysed and not regurgitate (great job, Whiskers). Applejack subsequently <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3530560#p3530560\" class=\"postlink\">admits that she should have asked for this a long time ago</a>, which was EXACTLY what I was thinking of: Why didn't she just ask?<br>\n<br>\nMoving on, she <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3531212#p3531212\" class=\"postlink\">mentions a strong Town read on both Whiskers &amp; Rainbowdash</a> when she was reading page 19, and this <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3534986#p3534986\" class=\"postlink\">carried forward</a> until she finished. This I find to be very strange because, well, reads are supposed to change over time adding in the new factors, unless there is another justification for it which I don't see. It feels like there is a gap in your reads. The final conclusion post just didn't have much conviction to it, which I fully expect after having so long to read. Since you've said you'll reread relevant portions of the thread later, I'll be expecting more stuff from you.<br>\n<br>\nOn a side note, you've mentioned Newbie 1040... which was about 2 years ago. A very early game. Wow, looking back I don't remember much details, but reading it I find you goofed up and helped lynched me D1 and got killed off N1. Nothing much to say about meta that long ago because I feel that I was a different player back then than I am now, so you can draw your on conclusions.<br>\n<br>\nOn another side note, I think we'll need to have a chat about posting from a mobile device postgame.<br>\n<br>\n------------<br>\n<br>\nNow, I deal with Rainbowdash. Ha, I've not forgotten about you. I've mentioned that I'll deal with you later, and that later is now!

Charlie's list of town to scum was strange to say the least (post 653). First of all there was little to no explanation.

Seems to me that Rainbowdash bought Pinkie Pie's (Whisker's) trust for $0.99. Now since I know these two are not scum together, I'm utterly confused right now.<div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF00BF\">Rainbow Dash hardly has my trust. I mean, Rainbow Dash is not the best liar, but this player isn't playing her quite exactly so I really can't give her a 100% clear. Right now though, I've decided that she's probably only scum if she's scum partners with you. </div><br>\n<br>\nWhiskers, I don't understand why, and when, did you about turn on your reads on myself and Thadmiral. Last I thought you were sensible enough to think ThAdmiral is the correct lynch. Then you voted for me, unvoted, then when I replied to everything you threw it away and threatened a melodramatic vote.<div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF00BF\">When did I do that? <br>\n<br>\nNo, no, ThAdmiral is still the lynch. I voted/unvoted you because I was testing Rainbowdash and Applejack. Actually, that's the reason why she could only be scum with you-- If RainbowDash and ThAdmiral were scum, she would have hammered you, winning the game. If Dashie and Applejack were scum, then she would have hammered you, winning the game. If Rainbow dash and <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">I</div> were scum, we would have ended the game a long time ago. </div><br>\n<br>\nI give up trying to understand you, Whiskers. Each time, despite much restrain, I find myself burying my head in disappointment over the things that you say or do. I make myself feel better by throwing away my original principle of 'give everyone the benefit of the doubt first'. I then replace it with my principle of how to behave while driving on the road, one which has kept me accident free. And that principle is 'assume that everyone else on the road is a dumbass'. I feel much better. <div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF00BF\">Walking makes Pinkie Pie a healthy pony.</div><br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_D7Ov0xKts\" class=\"postlink\">I'm so pathetic</a>.<br>\n<br>\nAnswers to Whiskers in chronology:<br>\n1. What is the point of pointing out syntax?<div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF00BF\">I actually take this back, since you were arguing syntax with syntax. However, rather than saying, \"It doesnt' matter what termonology I used\", You say, \"Oh, okay, I <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">know</div> then.\" </div><br>\n2. Not others having points, strong or not... ME deciding that everyone else has scum points. Not you, but me. Your opinion =/= my opinion. <div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF00BF\">Oh Rarity! If you don't want to be lynched, shouldn't you want to make me <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">share</div> your opinion? <br>\nAnd, as the element of Generosity, shouldn't <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">you</div> want to <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">share your opinion</div>? </div><br>\n1. You put a sarcastic remark here yet answered my sarcastic question in the next line, making me think that you're either not good at sarcasm or you're not good at sarcasm. <div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF00BF\">What about this-- what you said, I mean-- was sarcastic? <br>\nThe point has been there forever. (Not Sarcastic?) <br>\nHe's repeating it (Not Sarcastic?) <br>\nIt's been discussed to death (Not Sarcastic?) </div>On a serious note, what do you want to discuss about this, and would me saying stuff really make you change your mind about this one issue?<div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF00BF\"> I dunno. &lt;3</div><br>\n2. Answering my question with <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">You would do that if you were scum, that's why you would do that.</div></div> makes me facehoof. <div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF00BF\">You said, \"Either Something, or I'm lying! Why would I lie!?\" And you would lie if you're scum. Of course, the other thing could be <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">totally</div> possible too, right? </div>Asking me again that question, to which I've answered so many many many times, its because of my VCA which indicates that one of ThAdmiral/Mist Beauty is Mafia. Mist Beauty flipped Town therefore ThAdmiral is Mafia. <div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF00BF\">Well, link me to your VCA when you get the time, okay? *wink!*</div><br>\nI think you just don't care about my answers, or are intentionally ignoring them, Whiskers. This is very scummy in my books, and your wildcard status has been demoted (promoted?) into scummy status. Don't let this bother you, but I'm going to say now that you're just as likely to be Mafia as RD/AJ now. This makes it RD/AJ/PP which makes it everypony! Whee! Thank you for making yourself so difficult, Whiskers! <div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF00BF\">I dunno, I <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">like</div> a good challenge. Why do you think I spend so much time with Fluttershy? </div><br>\n<br>\nForgive my ramblings.

I maintain that I did not quickhammer, I was certain with like 99% certainly that Mist Beauty would flip Mafia at that point. She claimed without a Night Action which I find very wrong and disgenuine. It was the correct thing to do; I regret nothing. <div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF00BF\">Silly Filly!

My Town read on Tarson was early in the game where I wanted to see a voting bloc work out... in hindsight, this was what probably blinded me because I've seen it work before in a game I read, never thought of the idea of Mafia being so bold as to actually take control of one.

{"number": 1563, "id": "3541782", "user": "Applejack", "user_id": "17056", "content": "Neither of you have 3p LyLo experience?<br>\n<br>\nThat is at once both disappointing and interesting.<br>\n<br>\nHere's the thing: When you're in a 1:1 with somebody who, from your point of view, is confirmed scum, it's really hard to resist spamming each other into infinity. Scum have a vested interest in alienating town from the thread, and if it is a real 1:1, they would lose the game if they couldn't argue themselves to victory; therefore, they'd be spamming evidence against the other 1:1 player. Town would have difficulty ignoring that; while they have the option of saying they'll ignore the walls, they're still going to have difficulty resisting responding to the other 1:1's obviously false accusations.<br>\n<br>\nThe thought I was running with this morning was that both Charlie and ThAdmiral seemed relatively dispassionate compared to the 3p LyLo phases I've seen where somebody has to actually post to ask the two people in the 1:1 to shut up. I didn't have time to fully go through their iso, so I planned to ask for their meta so that I could take a look if they had any to offer and compare the games to this game. Instead, there's no meta, and I fell asleep(!), so here I am. I'll find out if I'm just spouting random things when I'm done reading (TODAY because there's no way in hell I'm spending my Wednesday evening on this) or if I'm onto something here.<br>\n<br>\nAt this point, I'm certain it's Charlie-ThAdmiral. ThAdmiral's response to my probing in post 1475 is a bad response; ThAdmiral said, definitively, that he didn't think Beck didn't shoot, not that he wish Beck did if it wasn't going to be Whiskers. Post 1313 and post 1494 are like the dartboard and dart, except the dart's completely missed the board. Also, Rainbowdash didn't hammer Charlie for the win when Whiskers moved her vote, which seals the deal for me. I'm stalling this game because I want to find evidence against Charlie before the Day ends, and I admit the thing above was me doing that.<br>\n<br>\nBut here's what I'm going to do. I have a midterm on Thursday, and I want to actually study for that thing lest I flunk it; I will not be failing exams on account of this game. I have a few hours before I have to leave for classes. I'm going to spend this time now reading this game and then posting my \"thoughts\" on it. \"But 'thoughts' are in quotes, Applejack!\" (Read that in a Rarity accent; I did.) Yes, because the crux of my thoughts are in the paragraph above; what you're essentially getting from me from now on are pre-3p LyLo arguments. If I don't finish, you're getting whatever is running through my head; if I finish, you get the same thing but more complete.

You even caught a 'slip' from him or something!\"<br>\n<br>\nThat's right. I did. Now here's the truth of it: I'm lynching Charlie. If I'm wrong about the Charlie and ThAdmiral pair, then this game is going to end, and I'll just sport a new expression on my avatar for a while. Except that I think -- no, I know -- that I am not wrong about this. There is no other answer that fits the puzzle. I've been holding the solution in my hands, yet I've been chicken with it because I feared that it couldn't be that simple. It really is.<br>\n<br>\nMy task here of solving the puzzle is done. My second task is to convince whichever of Rainbowdash and Whiskers survives that I am not scum. That's my Charlie vote. I am not going to deny I'm being manipulative because that's exactly what I am being with this vote. I honestly didn't understand what Rainbowdash was on about when she claimed I couldn't be scum with ThAdmiral, but when I asked her and she laid it out, the first thing that came to my mind was, \"Get out of jail free card!\" And here we are.<br>\n<br>\nI've caught up in the thread (except that huge fucking spoilered post because I had had enough pink at that point). I read through Charlie's iso in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?t=17813&amp;f=54&amp;st=0&amp;sk=t&amp;sd=a&amp;user_select=12732&amp;user_select2=0&amp;user_sort=Go\" class=\"postlink\">Mini 1192: My Little Pony Mafia</a>, which did nothing for me because ABSOLUTE CONVICTION and all that, but if you want, have a gander at that. In the early posts there as Charlie was reading, he was more evaluative; the couple of posts I pointed out sometime ago was more of a summary than an evaluation. Mobile posting doesn't stop one from having reads. \"Wait, Applejack. Only a couple of posts?

Thad is not by any means out of the question as a partner, but I really am thinking he is town in all of this who more or less got stuck on Charlie for the wrong reason, as seriously, I would have hammered Mist right there too if I had the chance.  BG who decided not to catch up after the game went to night?  Seems too incomprehensable that a town protective role would at least not skim the game for a town leader role and jump on them.  Lack of N1 protect target in the claim too, sounded bad.<br>\n<br>\nAnyways, I think its AJ given the way today was apporached by both ponies.  AJ while catching up continues to seem to lean to Thad for who she thought was scum.  While I dont have a problem with this too much, she also seemed somewhat convinced that it was Charlie and Thad together.  I feel that I at least somewhat conclusively proved it was not Whiskers from early on, and there was very little interest in me, enough to show subtle nods but not enough to do anything drastic.  Problem there is, if its Thad-Charlie, why so much hesitance to actually vote Charlie?  I just kinda got the feeling that she was just waiting to see if anypony would throw a wrong vote out there, by comitting slightly to Thad, but still staying enough on Charlie to not look wierd jumping on him.<br>\n<br>\nWhat I also dont get is how my \"Its not Thad-AJ\" mini case was actually what broke her to vote Charlie.  Its not like it disproved anything to her if she is town.  And I have no idea how thats a \"get out of jail free\" card or anything of that sort.  Seems like what I put up would be what breaks Whiskers who was leaning Thad to come over to Charlie, not somepony who was actually in the pairing I tried to disprove.<br>\n<br>\nFood for thought.<br>\n<br>\nI don't want to get into a massive debate since its going to cause even more WIFOM than this post im sure already is going to, but I just am getting a little nervous that its going to be missed in part if not whole if I dont do anything about it now.<br>\n<br>\n@Whiskers - If you want to get a little post up to before you hammer on why you seem to think Thad go for it.

I still have town reads of Whiskers and Rainbowdash for essentially the same reasons I've stated already in the thread, and I would have sworn my life on them except Rainbowdash brought up something really interesting about the Charlie-ThAdmiral pair earlier in the Day. If Rainbowdash is town, Mist Beauty's accusations over twilight would have made it easy for scum to put Rainbowdash up as an option in LyLo, but instead we have Charlie and ThAdmiral going at each other's throats. Granted, the two of them were already doing it as the Day was ending, but the justification that Mist Beauty gave was pretty big. I just spent close to 12 hours reading this thread non-stop, so I'm tuckered out and would like to take a break. I'll reread relevant portions of the thread later.<br>\n<br>\nAs a note to myself, I'm interested in looking closer that Charlie's and ThAdmiral's posts themselves, Charlie's and Rainbowdash's defenses, and probably Mist Beauty's twilight thoughts. I'll also take a gander at the voting spreadsheet to see if there's anything interesting there; I refuse to look at another VCA, though. Unfortunately, the NKs were mostly on power roles; Albert B. Rampage's soft claiming means I will not be able to determine if he was killed for his reads, his status in the game, or his soft claim, so I'm not happy about that.<br>\n<br>\nFor the record, I would have voted ThAdmiral. I agree with Whiskers that his suggestion that Beck shoot regardless of how Mist Beauty flipped was reckless. It's one thing to trust the kill to someone who is 100% town, but Beck was not going to have anything to keep him in check during the Night phase; when the game is decided by a group, the composition of the group isn't guaranteed, but there's less chance of the townies in the group screwing up due to checks and balances. This probably makes more sense in my head than written, but that's how I see it. Furthermore, Beck made it clear that he wanted to shoot Whiskers; if Whiskers is town -- and that's my belief at the moment -- ThAdmiral is scum for making this suggestion to Beck.<br>\n<br>\nBut I'm going to wait until I clear up the matter in the first paragraph before I make a final Applejack decision.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nApplejack pushin' ThAd an' Char go free <br>\nMatching up her focus with a silvertongued Rarity. <br>\nHoofin' up a line with her active lurking <br>\nI spit it 'cause I get it, makes sense to me. <br>\n<br>\nStill not quite clear though, wanna call out on a bus <br>\nWhere ThAd and Rarity scuff and tussle. <br>\nWhatya gonna do 'til ya give it that muscle? <br>\nHammer on the horn and tomorrow check the shuffle. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\nFun fact: As of right now, Applejack has said \"Charlie\" and \"ThAd\" 53 times a piece.

Don't misrep!<br>\n------------<br>\nAh, I remember GLaDOS was a Town read because of meta: same here, same then. However between Whiskers &amp; Beck &amp; some other people posting stuff &amp; stuff &amp; stuff in thread making the game move at breakneck speed, I feel that this read gradually diminishes into a null read because the level of goodposting gets diluted. Make sense? Yes. Yes it does.<br>\n*GLaDOS is likely Mafia until the level of goodposting increases to match. <div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Y</div>/N<br>\n------------<br>\nI've mentioned that Rainbowdash was difficult to read... yes, it's all true.. so I opted a very different and (arguably) unusual method: I did a search post by user and actually read her stuff (it's still meta). The end result I see is a more passive pony playstyle which is very odd. I can't discuss ongoing games but I did quiz her in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3416171#p3416171\" class=\"postlink\">ISO#17</a> about a completed one. Didn't really get anything from that.<br>\n*Rainbowdash is likely Mafia because she failed to out-talk the talk in this fast game i.e. one would expect more stuff from her when she just falls short. <div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Y</div>/N<br>\n------------<br>\nThAdmiral.... I remember him as the \"catch-up\" guy. I liked those catch-up posts, because Activity is Magic. Unfortunately the reality of the situation puts him at a null read. He ends up using the POE method to scumhunt (albeit wrongly; in terms of the result)<br>\n*ThAdmiral is a null read who ends up placing a vote on me which holds no water... Mafia? Y/<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">N</div><br>\n(Doesn't feel like it &amp; I can't conclude anything based on what he has posted. Maybe I need to reread? Y/<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">N</div>)<br>\n------------<br>\nWhiskers! This individual I do have a serious bone to pick with because he basically <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">lied to himself</div>. Did you or did you not once said something along the lines of \"I do not use &lt;<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">insert bad word here</div>&gt; readily\" or something similar along those lines? Did you or did you not repeat it at least twice in the last few pages? Yes, yes you did. This isn't good because if you're lying to yourself then there is no telling what you're doing to anypony else. Ergo, you <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">canno</div>t be trusted. Granted, Beck also was in the frenzy of words but there is something about this exchange that is weird. Let me try to rationalize...<br>\n<br>\nWhiskers said he isn't normally behaving like <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">this</div> (read: use of foul language)<br>\nOnly way he would be is when he gets emotional, right.<br>\nWell then where is the breaking point in the thread? I don't see anything that warrants its use...<br>\nSo...<br>\nLIES.<br>\nBut wait! Have I seen such a deception before?<br>\nHmm...<br>\nYes. I remember mentioning that playstyle shift thing and even voted him for that. I hold it to be true, even though what ThAdmiral said as a counterpoint remains to be true.<br>\n<br>\nSo, does this explain things swimmingly? No? Then forget it, my gut says Whiskers isn't Town<br>\n*Whiskers is scum because of behavior I find erratic. But the VCA I did says the opposite. This means there is a conflict between my logic side of my brain and the gut side of.... waitaminute. This is ridiculous. Anyway. When this problem occurs, I'd normally go with gut read. Whiskers is Mafia. <div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Y</div>/N<br>\n------------<br>\nUm, okay, who else? Beck? Well, a claimed vig...could be SK...

There is no reason for you to delay your vote in this situation. From your point-of-view, Rainbowdash is in a situation similar to me: If she were scum with Charlie, she would have won the game yesterday by pushing your lynch instead of bussing Charlie; therefore, only I would make sense as Charlie's partner.

I know you stated before that you doubt there's any scum motivation behind him making his post, but that is not my point. My point here is that, in trying to offer a piece of his mind, ThAdmiral accidentally let slip that his teammate roleblocked Beck on Night 3. Beck had very clearly stated before nightfall that he was not going to shoot if Mist Beauty flipped town; there was no reason to speculate whether he did or did not shoot. Furthermore, ThAdmiral did not even speculate about the possibility of a roleblocker in the setup when town would have said something about their post being speculation.<br>\n<br>\nWhen I <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3545984#p3545984\" class=\"postlink\">confronted him</a> with this and accused either him or Charlie of roleblocking Beck, he specifically denies: <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3546087#p3546087\" class=\"postlink\">\"No, <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">I</div> did not block Beck last Night.\"</a> When I asked him about this post the first time, his response was that <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3535698#p3535698\" class=\"postlink\">he wished Beck had shot</a>. The second time I asked him to explain the slip, he beat around the bush instead of directly address the problems with his post 1313 with a question about why he would assume that Beck had made a shot, quoted below.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=3546087#p3546087\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=3546087#p3546087\" data-post-id=\"3546087\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 1642</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4158\">ThAdmiral</a> wrote:</cite>No I didn't block beck last night. Even if I somehow did block beck why would I then automatically know he didn't shoot.

As a <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3502105#p3502105\" class=\"postlink\">claimed innocent townie</a>, he could not have possibly assumed Beck tried to shoot because:<br>\n<br>\n<ol style=\"list-style-type:decimal\"><li> the obvious conclusion for any townie <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3488092#p3488092\" class=\"postlink\">reading Beck's second-to-last post in the game</a> would be that <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Beck did not shoot</div>, and</li>\n<li> no townie thinks \"Beck probably tried to shoot!\" when there's no second flip and no evidence of a roleblocker.</li></ol><br>\nA townie may feel certain that there is some sort of roleblocking power on the scum's side given the flipped town power, but there will always be an air of uncertainty when they talk setup. Furthermore, Occam's razor takes us right back to the first point: There was no reason for Beck to renege on his promise.<br>\n<br>\nThe part about ThAdmiral wishing Beck shot is a load of horseapples that is not even an approximation of the above post. If you wish something happened, you don't say, \"I don't think it happened!\" You say, \"I wish it did happen.\"<br>\n<br>\n<div align=\"center\"><hr style=\"height:14px;width:50%\"></div>If the above partial wall was not enough of a dealbreaker, I've got more.<br>\n<br>\nI will reiterate why I am not scum with Charlie. I had a case on ThAdmiral toward the end of Day 4, and Whiskers was willing to vote ThAdmiral. If I were scum, it would have been a very simple matter to lynch ThAdmiral instead of Charlie. In that situation, while I would still benefit from town cred I would gain on Day 5 by bussing Charlie, it would have taken far less effort to just convince one player to vote ThAdmiral with me and end the game on Day 4. Charlie was the more difficult lynch, and the person who wanted to lynch Charlie -- you -- had already made it clear during Whiskers's voting gambit that you were not a hasty voter and would take everything into consideration, including the nature of the Charlie vote itself. From Applejack-scum's point-of-view, it would  have been easier to just win the game than pull off an elaborate bus.<br>\n<br>\n\"Wait, Applejack. You pushed through a Charlie lynch first anyway. You're serving me one of your apple ciders, and they're the alcoholic kind!\"<br>\n<br>\nYes, I am evil and manipulative, and a lot of things in this post are WIFOM. However, something you should know about me is that I play to win. I don't play to look clever, nor do I play for some twisted glory of winning despite handicapping myself. If there is a way to win, I will absolutely take it and run. I don't need town cred when there's an easy lynch in front of me that would directly lead to a win.<br>\n<br>\nHowever, the truth is that I am not scum, and I actually do need town cred going into Day 5 or else I lose the game. The case you made for the scum team not being Applejack-ThAdmiral was the catalyst for me in deciding to lynch Charlie first. I realized that the difficulty in getting Charlie lynched relative to ThAdmiral could help me turn the tables; if I could convince whoever was going to be with me on Day 5 that Applejack-scum could have just won the game by lynching ThAdmiral-town first, then I would have a fighting chance in this second LyLo.", "time": "Thu Nov 03, 2011 4:24 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=18952&start=1650", "forum": "53", "thread": "18952"}

Oh well. I targeted Rainbow specifically because I thought there was a fairly decent chance she was mafia. If I had realized that there was such a small chance that people would look into who I might have targetted, I probably would have picked Glados instead. Of course, it wouldn't have mattered, since I was shot anyway.<br>\n<br>\nAnyhow, I don't feel like this was a strong game on my part at all.
