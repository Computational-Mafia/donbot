Tonight, each of you shall take part in a wonderful game where the winners shall all receive a prize of untold riches! Each of you gathered here has received, along with your invitations, the role in which you shall play in this dinner mystery performance! Rest assured, all expenses have been taken care of by our gracious host, so please, relax, and enjoy your stay here while the game is in session!<br><br>Further instructions have been provided for you to follow, and you will be wise to look them over and abide by them during the course of this game.</span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">1) General Rules</span></span><br>1a. This is a game, and sportsmanlike conduct is expected. I will not tolerate personal attacks. This is your only warning.<br>1b. I am the moderator of this game, and as such, I will decide what to do in any given situation.<br>1c. That said I am not infallible. If there are ever any error(s) you notice, please contact me via PM with the error(s) and I will see to it they will be dealt with.<br>1d. I also reserve the right to amend or add onto the rules if the need for so arises. Any changes that may/may not be made will be made public when they occur.<br>1e. <span style=\"color: #800000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span style=\"font-style: italic\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">This is my font type; as such, using it is against the rules.</span></span></span></span><br>1f. If you wish to address the game mod during play, you may either PM me or post in the thread; if you post in thread your post must be bolded, and start with \"@MOD:\" or I may miss it.<br>1g. I reserve the right to force-replace a player at my own digression, and if I am required to mod-kill a player, their role shall be changed to \"Neutral-Survivor,\" and they shall lose the game.<br>1h. In the event of a mod-kill, the game shall proceed automatically to the next game phase.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">2) Activity and Gameplay</span></span><br>2a. Posting and participating in the game is required of all players not on V/LA. If you forsee being unable to post please post in-game of this, and if you must leave the game please PM me with a replacement request.<br>2b. A person who is not on V/LA and has not posted within 3 days of their latest post shall be prodded by me.<br>2c. If a player does not respond to a prod within 4 days of being prodded, they will be forcibly replaced.<br>2d. I will only prod each player twice. On the third required prodding, the player shall instead be forcibly replaced.<br>2e. Unless otherwise stated in your role PM, you are <span class=\"noboldsig\">NOT</span> allowed to privately communicate with other players outside of the game thread.<br>2f. <span class=\"noboldsig\">DO NOT</span> quote any discussions you may have with the moderator of the game, whether in text or picture format. Doing so will result in a mod-kill and your role being changed to \"neutral-survivor\" and forfeiting the game.<br>2g. Encrypted, invisible, or small/hard to read text is <span class=\"noboldsig\">NOT</span> allowed.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">3) Voting</span></span><br>3a. All votes that are to be counted towards official vote counts must be in bold. You may also use the vote tags as well.<br>3b. Moderator vote counts will be posted as soon as possible.<br>3c. If you would like an official vote count, you may also post in the thread requesting one by typing \"@MOD: Vote count please,\" or any clear derivatives of that.<br>3d. Unvoting is not required, but highly appreciated. To unvote, you may post in bold \"Unvote,\" or use the unvote tags.<br>3e. A lynch will occur when there are a majority of players voting for a person to be lynched. If no majority is reached by deadline, then no-lynch will occur.<br>3f. No-Lynch is an acceptable vote as well.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">4) Deadlines</span></span><br>4a. Each day phase shall last 3 weeks, and each night shall last 4 days.<br>4b.Extensions to each may be granted if need be.<br>4c. Any night action not received before deadline will be counted as a no-action. If you have an ability and wish to not act, please PM me with your decision.<br><br>At least one person has received the following role:<br><div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: Sample VT Role PM</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display: none;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic\">Now, at least one player has been given the following role for this game:<br><br>Hello, and greetings [username]!

Oooh, but I DO know some ponies who have other musical instruments! Like, Lyra has a little harp, and Octavia plays the double bass, and DJ-PON3 does some really dope scratching on her turntables! There's also a pony that plays piano, I think, but I forget his name. <br>Ooh, and there's Scootaloo and Sweetie Belle and Apple Bloom, and they all put on a rock and roll CONCERT for a talent show once, and I could use that, except they didn't actually have guitars, so I decided against it. I might go back and use that, though, because they looked pretty funny in their costumes and I think you might really like them! Although, you might ask Rarity about costumes, since she knows ALL about clothes and stuff. <br><br>I also wanted to point out to theamateur that you might THINK you're safe from all this love, but your avatar is a pony too! :3 <br><br>The Princess is waiting for an avatar from me too. I made it and then told her I'd upload it and then I forgot and fell asleep!

I don't take the idea of replacing out lightly. I've never done it before, and I hate when other people do it. <br><br>Whiskers, I appreciate that you have made some substantive contributions to the game, but I resent having to sift through a load of pony crap to get to it. I also resent that this is what I'm spending my time thinking and talking about rather than digging for scum tells. My problem with the pony speak and role playing isn't that I hate My Little Pony or role playing (I've got a shelf full of D&amp;D books). It's that indulging in pony speak and role playing is very clearly resulting in less clarity and concision in certain players' posts, which hurts the town, period. It makes it harder to find scum tells, it makes it harder to analyze points, and it's distracting. I understand that you all are having fun with it, and I don't have a problem with that necessarily, but it's not what I signed up for when I signed up for a mini-normal game, which are explicitly unthemed. I'm a little different than most players on this site in that I only play in one game at a time, and I try my best to be committed and focused on that game. I'm not sure I want this to be the one game I play for the next few months. At the same time, I don't want to spoil the fun of the half dozen or so of you who enjoy talking like cartoon ponies. You're entitled to play the game how you want, although I'd suggest that you might have been better off setting up a theme game if that's the kind of game you were looking for. <br><br>So the bottom line is, I'm not digging the pony talk, but I don't want to be the guy that poops on your pony talk party, so I don't feel like I can ask you to stop. I'm considering allowing a few RL days to pass and see if I get used to the pony speak, but based on how much it is irritating me atm and how counterproductive I think it is, I think that's pretty unlikely. Sorry to keep bitching about it, but there it is. I'll try my best to be productive from here on out until I decide that I just can't be productive in this kind of environment."}

I'd like to have you playing with us, because I think you'll be really helpful to the town, and I'm really REALLY happy that you aren't throwing a big temper tantrum like some other ponies might do. *rolleyes* <br><br>Thank you for being nice and trying to tolerate. That's really all we ask. <br><br>[Pinkie Pie PREEDIT!!!] <br>Oh gosh, GLaDOS, some of the ponies and me were talking in PMs before we even signed up fgor this game! That's Rainbow Dash, and monk and me, and then I PMed Charlie and tarsonisocelot to talk avatars and ask them if they needed coaching with their ponyspeak! <br><br>We didn't talk about voting blocks though. Maybe they just didn't let me in on that one... ;__;"}

As I said, this is about the extent of roleplaying that I do, and at least a couple ponies in this game can vouch that it really doesn't stop me from getting stuff done.  Most ponies even tend to enjoy it after a while if they let themselves, although it coming from half the game may be quite the culture shock.  The speak, pictures for emotion emphisis at times, I do agree that being too far out there in roleplay is a bad thing, and Whiskers I can tell will definantly hoof that line in this game.  Im actually most concerned over what monk may do though since he is playing the overly shy and timid player.  He does need to actually take a stance at some point, even if it requires character breaking to an extent to be useful.<br><br>I still really like my vote though.<br><br>Theamature continues to line up on odd sides of the debate over the \"trolling\" arguement, first trying to convince Gutherie, who I actually have as one of my mild town reads, to vote ABR over him, while admitting that he has a null read on ABR himself.  Now he is listening to me about his odd vote, yet refuses to vote him over GLaDOS who is one of the ponies he is waiting to help move the game along, but im not sure if thats the reason he is trying to vote him or not since that has gone unexplained the the exception of emphisis that he does not want the Gutherie vote.<br><br>His last vote is pretty bad too.  He is attacking somepony for actually suggesting starting and alliance, even more unusal about the whole thing to me was that tarin was trying to get me starting something instead of him, which I really do not see scum doing because they are leaving the entire creation of an alliance in someponies hooves that they have little control over instead of doing something themselves and then trying to invite the ponies that are normal powerhouses in the game."}

This may be more natural to me, given my more brash and headstrong personality.  That translates better to getting stuff done here, but I think you somehow can apply your, whatever it is you do, personality to the game.  Fun things are fun, but they shouldn't get in the way of winning."}

Oh well.<br><br>Thamature really never responded to any points against, him and monk did a really good job of laying out just about everything right there.  To make a more concise case that leans away from PBPA though, here is some food for thought:<br><br>Nothing has ever really been responded too in the whole early trolling vote exchange.<br><br>Early there is what appears to be deflection of trolling from himself to ABR, and when pressed on that he immediately says that ABR was not scummy for what he was doing and instead Gutherie was voting for a bad reason.  Gutherie isn't scummy though to theamature, which is where I stop understanding things.  It essentially means that theamature tried to move a vote from himself from a null pony to a null pony instead of addressin what he considered to be weak reasoning for a vote.  This doesn't really mesh with what I consider to be a town mindset, since its far more concerned with having votes on somepony else instead of trying to convince somepony that their logic is flawed.<br><br>I really dislike his stance against town alliance as well.  Even if we decide to ignore my read on tarin being town which I still agree with, and given where these attack are coming from is being strengthened, its the fundamental idea of trying to stop a group of ponies from coming together.  When you look at the fact that I already was showing suspicion of theamature at the point the alliance was brought up, it may be more valid here.<br><br>Im at a loss for why he is voting monk at this point really too.  He called monk town back in 155, but moved his vote back based of thinking that tarin was scum with him.  I would like to see some shred of a case there.<br><br>Not completely done, just out for a bit more.  Busy busy."}

This all loops back into my town reads, which as I have elluded to are most of the wagon on monk a little bit ago, you and Gutherie I definantly think are town at this point, and to a lesser extent, Beck, Tarin and subgenius I all have town reads on.

My justification was that I already wanted to lynch theamateur, for my own, non-game reasons. <br>Similarly, my case against lynching monk was shit-- I had a fantasy about keeping all the ponies around and then derailing and ending the game with only ponies left (ending in a trolls-win game).

The second one is speculating on a third party since both you and theamateur bring it up-- like, nopony is talking about an SK, and then one of you suddenly does.

I've used the same argument in the past, but I don't think it has ever ended up working out for me. If we lynch theamatuer, and he ends up flipping town, I'll be more interested in analyzing the wagon and looking at NK's than assuming that theamatuer's innocence proves monk's guilt. Also, I would point out that I think theamatuer makes a fantastic bussing candidate, so I wouldn't be surprised to find scum pushing his wagon whether amatuer is scum or not.<br><br>I'm leaning slightly town on Rainbow."}

You say this like its something that will greatly benifit scum to do, but does it really?  I actually don't see monk-scum pulling off the wagon unless thamature is also scum, and even then I really am not to sure he would do that instead of trying to rack up town credits for being on the lynch and the counterwagon.  Just feels like somepony realizing a tipping point of a wagon and suddenly second guessing it, not sure anypony can say they never have felt that way when somepony jumped on the wagon they had been pushing.<br><br>Also abandon the big counterwagon to start a new one?  Not making me feel like scum move.<br><br>By no means is monk my top town read, but I really have a hard time seeing him making most of these moves as scum.  Before somepony cries WIFOM yeah sure it could be.  But its far more likely to be town.  Really do not see monk backing off a rival wagon when somepony says they will hammer followed by trying to start up a new wagon.  I would vote theamature over monk easily here, the play from monk is very jumpy, but it reads town jumpy.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Whiskers wrote:</cite>RainbowDash, another question.

Either way she is leaving it up to me for what actually becomes of it, and I will say it again, maybe the the chagrine of GLaDOS, I cannot see scum giving me that type of control over what they hope to be that many players.  Its gutsy beyond gutsy, especially as Taron knows I tend to be decent at picking out scum.  I will concede this a little looking back at it more, I sort of just stopped reading it all proud like when she said I would get control over it, but yeah, I still see this as a town move."}

You don't get to pull this type of stuff on me.  Think long and hard about who is responsable for getting some of the early play started, its me.  I will force early action in this game and compared to what other ponies did, im one of the driving forces behind the theamature wagon even though im not even on it anymore.  At the same time im the biggest force against the Tarin and monk wagons because im pretty sure my little ponies are town there, so I will stop them from getting lynched at nearly all costs.  I mean, they aren't going to be lynched if I have anything to say about it, and I have something to say.<br><br>You complain that I am not paying attention to the monk wagon?  Yeah.  I see it, I can sorta get your reasoning since she was a little choppy in regards to the thamataure wagon which I actually moved my vote to her for a little due to, but look at the recent play from her.  That is town motivation all the way since it would require a sudden wagon to show on Whiskers to have any chance of survival essentially since monk was suddenly arguing against the main counter wagon to herself.  Scum talking themselves into a corner like that?  Very rare.  Also you have Whiskers and Theamature who both are nearly for sure NOT scum with monk making very odd moves in regard to that wagon, which just continues to make me think monk is town.<br><br>If you are just going to continue to push on monk, at least tell me why I am wrong in the specific quotes I addressed regarding monk.  You say its a scum tell in a few, but to be a scum tell it would need to actually benifit scum, which I do not see as really happening.  Something that makes no sense from town standpoint is not always going to be scumtell unless it benifits scum, if it benifits neither, or arugeably barely benifits a side, its null.  Attempting to lable null tells scum tells is in itself a slight tell, and is usually a sign of a forming mislynch.<br><br>Tarin is also town, I mean what is the case on her?  Something like<br>1) Tried to start an alliance<br>2) Lurky?<br>3) Recent vote<br><br>If anything the only applicable point is the third one, and I think the voting location track record from Tarin has actually been quite good if you remove the ABR vote which I still think is a stupid wagon when it was at its mini-peak.  Again, the alliance thing was a town tell to me, even if Tarin is scum here, it gives me control over a chunk of votes.  Something I can't see scum doing willingly like that, especially since as I have said, Tarin has seen me play and knows I can read ponies pretty well.  She isn't lurking either, this is what, four life days into the game?  This game is <span style=\"font-style: italic\">fast</span>.  She is keeping up with the game and her read changes feel very natural.  Not to mention the wagon that popped up on her is two scum reads and only one town read.  I think Gutherie is just bucking up the wrong tree, but when the two ponies I am most interested in start the wagon, I know where im going to stand in all of this.<br><br>I will defend these two ponies all day if I have to.  Whiskers case up later tonight or tomorrow probably.<br><br><img src=\"http://www.ponychan.net/chan/pic/src/131256637718.gif\" alt=\"Image\"><br><br>Dash got their backs."}

You've given no indication otherwise (except, of course, for your saying just now, \"Wait no, it wasn't sheeping, I SWEAR,\" which, you might as well declare that you're town, too, forall the good it will do you.) and until you can provide a REASON, you will be sheeping.

To note this is actually where I ended up voting monk because monk reacted as though he expected theamature to flip town right after this post.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>If you do go into L-1 again, I still probably won't hammer. The case against you, I don't feel it. <br><br>I was mostly intent on lynching you for your anti-pony sentiment, being a bad (uninformed) troll. But shit got real, and as we move away from the ideal world where we lynch and NK away every non-pony and then just NoLynch and No NK for the rest of the game (Friendship wins), I will find a target for better reasons than those. </div></blockquote><br><br>This essentially means that Whiskers called for a claim by a hammer threat, only to immediately say that the case against him is nearly nonexistant.  Whiskers goes on to make a strikingly similar case to what Taris is pushing on him right now, for not contributing and slightly trolling.  Neither reasoning is good, but I don't understand how you can push on somepony when you actually threatened to hammer and got somepony you openly admit to thinking the case is poor on.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I'm not bothered by not wanting to claim at L-1. If we were going to lynch you anyway, we'd see your role reveal in your flip. <br>I'm just curious why you decided it was necessary to claim when unvoted.</div></blockquote><br><br>Feels like more subtle pushing on theamature after Whiskers still has called that pony town.  I cannot understand why anypony would be doing anything to make somepony question a pony they think is town already.  When you think somepony is town, you don't let them get lynched, not give ammo to attackers.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>RainbowDash, switch your vote. If you're serious about theamateur, you can push on him tomorrow. </div></blockquote><br><br>This is one bigger point to me still.  I really am not seeing theamature-monk as a team, and this post implies that monk is town, since that is the only way I could see a theamature flip.  When you combine with with the fact that I already have a town read on monk due to recent play not making any sense from scum, and please whatever pony is saying WIFOM just analyse what the benifits of making that move possibly could be.  That post from Whiskers really sounds like explicit expectation of monk flipping town.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Actually, I was keeping my vote off tarson too, to avoid accusations of OMGUS and a speedy Whiskers-lynch. </div></blockquote><br><br>Showing more concern with self-image then with voting who she says her top picks actually are.  Not to mention the really bad reasoning behind the tarson wagon already.  According to Whiskers, the entire case on Tarin seems to be active lurking, which she obviously is not.  She is not making a large number of posts, but there is a daily contribution that some ponys are passing off as sheeping, but you need to realize in that about 100 hours we have had three different ponies reach L-2.  That is a fast game.  I can't blame anypony for having trouble keeping up in this game, I have more time on my hooves then most ponies and occasionally get behind a little.<br><br>Might have more to put up, but its late and the weather needs to happen tomorrow.  Expect something within 12 hours though."}

(Sheeping, pressure, moving a vote from a wagon on a <span style=\"color: #804080\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">mid-content, high-verbage, low-postcount</span></span></span> player to a wagon on a <span style=\"color: #0080BF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">low content, low verbage, mid-postcount</span></span></span> player.) ((COLORS NOT INDICATIVE OF ANYTHING, JUST USED FOR SEPARATION.) <br><br>Scum is on my wagon. Players came from every wagon except mine, to vote Mister Albert. <br>Beck, subgenius and Guthrie are varying degrees of town. Guthrie, I need to look at your meta, and subgenius, I need to look at your scum meta. <br><br>Fucking fascinating, is that town players who were not on my wagon came to vote albert. <span style=\"font-style: italic\">Some</span> of the players on my wagon are scum. Can't be all of them, that's unbalanced. but some of them. They are on my wagon and not on Albert's. This tells me that Albert is scum and so are other players on my wagon. <br>Any votes changed from my wagon to Albert's after this post will not be counted as town tells, just WIFOM. <br><br>tarson is voting me for claiming to have played against wincon. Charlie is voting me for having changed my playstyle from playing against wincon. <br>RainbowDash has been on every wagon so far. <br>Albert B. Rampage is scum. <br>monk? I could go either way. Beck says some stuff about monk a page or two ago that I really like, the whole thing is very confusing. I'll need to review the stuff. The monk/amatuer interaction and monk's later play. <br><br>GLaDOS needs to remove her vote from Beck.

It's like trying to follow directions without knowing where to the starting point is. We should lynch whoever the scummiest individual is today, then form conclusions based on the flip. Trying to make cases without knowing any alignments at all is not productive.<br><br>Candidates for scum in no particular order:<br>*Albert: He's very clearly making a concerted effort to appear anti-town. It's conceivable that he's putting on this act simply in the hopes of dodging a NK, but if that's the case I think he's going overboard. I'm putting my money on him trying to WIFOM us into thinking that no scum would be so blatantly obnoxious.<br><br>*theamatuer: I'm a big believer in SK fixation being a mafia tell.<br><br>*Whiskers: A bunch of little things, but I think the one that gets me most is how much she lets her assumptions about how others will judge her votes affect her voting choices. I haven't researched this, so I might be wrong (though I suspect not by much), but I think she's probably justified more of her voting choices with non-read related reasons than actual scum reads. (unvote of theamateur, deciding not to vote Tarsonis, trying not to vote ponies in the beginning).<br><br>*monk: I don't like how he's shirking the accountability for his votes. If you're going to be in a voting block, you need to buy into the reads and stand behind them. Otherwise, get off of the bloc, and do your own scum hunting.<br><br>*ThAdmiral: I believe Admiral when he says he hasn't had time to post. He posted a similar message in his other game, but I've seen scum hide behind states of permanent catch up before. It's pretty easy to blend in when you're commenting on already digested material. Something to keep an eye on.<br><br>*TO/RD: I could easily see these two being mafia together. As I said earlier, I have no issues with voting blocs in principle, but as I see it, the purpose of a voting bloc is to efficiently exert pressure on players. That hasn't been happening. They're not rocking the boat. The biggest effect I've seen from from the voting bloc is that RD has repeatedly claimed that the bloc is a town tell for TO.<br><br>*malpascp: King lurker. Generate some content or get out. You know I asked you a question about your vote a few days ago, right?<br><br>*Charlie: Wish he's post more and be a bit more cooperative. Look forward to seeing his scum list. <br><br>You know, what? TBH, I'm going through the player list in my head, and I can see just about everyone being scum for one reason or another, which is kind of sad.<br><br>Closest person I have to a town read might Glados.

Really you don't think monk could be scum?<br><br>Show examples of what monk has done that is pro town.</div></blockquote><br>Did I say I don't think monk could be scum? If I didn't think there was any chance monk is scum, I wouldn't be considering voting for him.<br><br>I'd be hard pressed to find good pro-town play from most players in this game, and monk is no exception. I just don't think there's a good case on him. My money is on town vs town, because your interaction with monk has the long, repetitive arguments that often seem to show up between two town players. If one of you were scum, I'd expect a more serious scum tell to drop at some point. For a time, I thought you were possibly bussing monk, but I've since decided against that possibility. As far as my read on you, I don't think your tunneling is productive. I might even go so far as to call it anti-town, but I think it's townie behavior. As far as monk goes, I just don't see any reason to think he's scum. You keep talking about scum tells, and I understand what you're referring to, but I don't see them as smoking guns at all. You'll just have to accept that some people don't agree with your case. I don't have any specific town tells except a general gut feeling that he's doing his best to be productive in a game that has a lot of borderline incoherent posting.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Beck wrote:</cite>Sub- after you post my request on monk, give me your reads on Charlie and Guthrie.</div></blockquote><br>Charlie: Tough to read, too few posts to form a strong read, but I will say that I don't think the justifications for his votes has been particularly strong. He has the excuse of posting from a handheld device, but that won't be acceptable indefinitely. Rereading his ISO, I notice that his vote for you (Beck) was because it agreed with his previous scum list, but he never explained his scum list, meaning he never explained his vote. He's one of the players that I'm quite suspicious of, but haven't seen anything overtly scummy. He could maybe use some pressure.<br><br>Guthrie: I have no idea, I can't even remember the last time he posted. Looking at his votes, it looks like he hasn't really done much lately besides sheep on to wagons, so it appears he's a sheeping lurker, which puts him on the scummy side of a null read."}

After hearing the debacle over the intruders, all of the guests attending were restless. Throughout the night, several guests could be found resting in the lobby, too uneasy to sleep in their own rooms. Several guests would even go into the rooms of other guests, hoping that the company of another would bring them solstice and comfort through the night.<br><br>The host, resting in his private rooms, contemplated the events that had transpired over the course of the day. This affair had brought a great deal of stress on him, and he was worried that soon his own guests would turn against one another from the threats made by the mysterious group of burglars. But, such a minor threat would not be able to best him, so he began to contemplate what events should be held for the following day..<br><br>As the sun rose, and daylight crept in through the windows, the guests all gathered in the large dining hall for the morning buffet. The host stood at the head of the table, and prepared a toast for everyone.<br><br>\u201cI trust everyone has slept well? I have planned many a great event for this morning, and many more surprises for the rest of the day. Now, is everyone here? I have an announcement to make.\u201d<br><br>A voice chimed out from the crowd<br><br>\u201cAlbert and subgenius are not here sir.\u201d<br><br>\u201cWell, can someone please go to their rooms and wake them? This is something everyone should hear,\u201d said the host. One of the maids and several guests left the dining hall.<br><br>A few minutes passed as the host addressed the guests, warning them not to let the threatening letter discourage them from enjoying their time at the estate. He assured them that the matter would be handled properly, and that no further harm would come to his guests. As he was coming to the conclusion of his speech, a man came running in through the door. Beads of sweat were running down his face, and he was out of breath.<br>\u201cThey\u2019re dead, they\u2019re both dead!\u201d he cried out. The room fell silent..<br></span></span>"}

Deadline's 4 days from today, so Saturday.</span></span></span></span><br><br>===<br>Flavor:<br>===<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"font-style: italic\">The guests were in an uproar for the remainder of the day. All of them tried to enjoy themselves, but lurking in the back of everyone\u2019s minds, the thought of the murders lingered. After the police came through and gathered testimonies from everyone, they assured them that the situation would be taken care of, and to put it out of their minds.<br><br>The host, however, was uneasy. The entire day\u2019s plans were starting to fall apart. The performers he originally hired to act out a Shakespearean play had almost refused to put on their play before he offered to triple their pay. The afternoon circus wasn\u2019t faring any better, as the ringmaster was refusing to perform without having his own payment increased as well.<br><br>All the stress started to wear on the host. However, he still had confidence in his guests to maintain composure and that tonight, dinner would go without any incidents. At the same time, he couldn\u2019t help but feel a foreboding sense of terror..<br><br>\u201cLadies and gentlemen, I welcome you once again to dinner this evening,\u201d he started with.  \u201cA fine assortment of foods and drinks have been prepared for all of you to enjoy, graciously provided for you tonight free of charge, as you all deserve nothing less!\u201d<br><br>A quiet applause rippled throughout the room. It lasted for a few seconds, but soon all but faded away. However, in the back of the room, one person leaning against the wall continued clap slowly, more slow than everyone had before.<br><br>\u201cYou\u2019re full of it, old man,\u201d the figure started. \u201cYou know just as well as I do that you\u2019re terrified for your life here.\u201d<br><br>\u201cHow dare you insult the host?!\u201d cried out a voice sitting at the table. \u201cTarson, you had better explain yourself!\u201d The room became full with chatter.<br><br>\u201cOh, I will,\u201d he started, with a grin on his face. \u201cThis old fool? he\u2019s terrified. He\u2019s just putting up a show for you, so you don\u2019t realize we\u2019re all doomed!\u201d<br><br>Maxwell stood up from the table, walked over to tarson, then punched him across the face. Tarson stumbled backwards, then returned with a punch of his own. The rest of the guests rushed to pull the two apart. All the while the host stood at the end of the table awestruck.<br><br>Struggling to get free, Tarson continued to try to punch and kick and bite his way free, shouting obscenities all the while. During the commotion, a slip of paper fell out from his waistcoat pocket. One of the female guests reached down to pick up the paper, then shouted when she finished reading it.<br><br>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d asked Charlie.<br><br>\u201cThe note, it says that he\u2019s going to kill someone else tonight!\u201d Everyone froze and stared at tarson. He flailed his arms and broke free, then turned and pulled out a gun and waved it around. He swung it around, moving from person to person, spinning in place.<br><br>\u201cStay back,\u201d he yelled, \u201cor I\u2019ll start shooting!\u201d His expression was panicked, his hands were shaking, and he was laughing uncontrollably. \u201cStay away from me!\u201d<br><br>Bang.<br><br>Tarson fell to the ground, a red hole appearing in his chest. The host stood at the end of the room, a pistol gripped tightly in his hands.. He started to crawl away, but Charlie reached down and grabbed Tarson\u2019s pistol.<br><br>He fired another round into tarson\u2019s head, and he was dead.<br></span></span>"}

The host, after the meal, alerted the authorities to the incident. The body was loaded into an ambulance, statements were taken, and soon after everyone went to bed.<br><br>Again, the host contemplated in his study, pondering the next day\u2019s events. After the incident the night before, the magician he had originally hired to perform refused to put on his show, and left soon after midnight. The host was not worried, for he had several other avenues of entertainment lined up, but for tonight, he wanted to rest easy. While one of the intruders was found and killed, there were still more. He could not be sure how many remained, but progress was progress.<br><br>In the bar, several guests could be seen, conversing with one another. The band playing was performing a slow jazz tune. Other guests were in their rooms, or in the rooms of other guests, amusing themselves in various forms of entertainment..<br><br><br>The next morning, the host walked down to the bar to meet with his bartender, find out how things went the night before. He said everything was going well, but that there was a stench coming from the bathroom.<br><br>As he walked to the bathroom door, scotch in hand, the smell grew more and more noticeable, until it became almost unbearable. He knocked on the door, but as he did it swung open. Inside, the body of Maxwell could be found lying in a pool of blood on the floor. A notepad and pen were clenched in each of his hands, with a broken cell phone at his feet.<br><br>The host stumbled backwards, and looked to the bartender. He told him to alert the authorities, but the bartender looked back at him with a grimace. The host knew immediately what was wrong.<br><br>Several guests stormed into the room, some still wearing pajamas. Their faces showed expressions of surprise, fear, and sorrow.<br><br>\u201cSir, monk was found dead in his room!\u201d cried out one of the maids. The host stumbled to his feet, then calmly walked over to the bar.<br><br>\u201cGet me the police, and another scotch,\u201d he said with a heavy tone.

Monk I was actually waivering on quite a bit too after the Tarson flip, so maybe a bit surprising but it was expected-ish.  Theamature I was thinking scum too, so that one was bad.  Think overall I have been doing decent though in keeping both monk and ABR out of the gallows.<br><br>Not entirely sure where im going at this point.  Almost want to say Beck, but for entirely different reason then what Whiskers, who has gone crazy but looks town-crazy, is pushing.  Need to check in on other things first though, want to see what has happened with Thad and Guth-replacement who my notes on are basically blanks."}

I was convinced at that point that theamateur was likely enough to be scum, that I was ready to hammer him. Since town is a big pussy and wasn't willing to hammer him (he was at L-1), I put him at L-2, hoping somepony else would put him BACK at L-1, and I'd hammer him FTW. <br>Then ThAdmiral came on and posted a case why he WASN'T Scum, which made me reconsider. <br><br>LATER, I voted for theamatuer, because the Day Needed to End.

You tunneled on one player for percieved scumtells (ignoring any evidence to the contrary-- see GLaDOS for more on that)), occasionally nudged another, somewhat-scummy-looking, incredibly jerkass player, and touched on Tarsonisocelot ONCE. MINOR DISTANCING? <br><br>Btw, how do you even get \"tarson is 100% scum\" from VCA? I looked (#962) and I don't get it.  <br><br>From this, I could say that you've only ever seriously voted for townies, or say that you've voted for townies 66% of the time (75% now, now that you've also voted me). <br><br>Rainbow Dash having voted for various people doesn't make her scum. Jesus christ. Why is it a scumtell?<br><br>Then you've got GLaDOS, who \"was on\" three different wagons. So? You voted Three different times.

I admitted to not playing towards wincon Day 1, then changing playstyle. tarson wanted to lynch me for changing playstyle. Didn't want me to play towards wincon. Charlie agreed. Neat, grasping @ straws? I admitted to not playing toward wincon and changed. Deal with it. You didn't have much to say at the time. <br><br>The worst thing is, Beck, that I don't know where to put you. I want so bad to vote for you, but all evidence points to your being town.

Don't misrep!<br>------------<br>Ah, I remember GLaDOS was a Town read because of meta: same here, same then. However between Whiskers &amp; Beck &amp; some other people posting stuff &amp; stuff &amp; stuff in thread making the game move at breakneck speed, I feel that this read gradually diminishes into a null read because the level of goodposting gets diluted. Make sense? Yes. Yes it does.<br>*GLaDOS is likely Mafia until the level of goodposting increases to match. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Y</span>/N<br>------------<br>I've mentioned that Rainbowdash was difficult to read... yes, it's all true.. so I opted a very different and (arguably) unusual method: I did a search post by user and actually read her stuff (it's still meta). The end result I see is a more passive pony playstyle which is very odd. I can't discuss ongoing games but I did quiz her in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3416171#p3416171\" class=\"postlink\">ISO#17</a> about a completed one. Didn't really get anything from that.<br>*Rainbowdash is likely Mafia because she failed to out-talk the talk in this fast game i.e. one would expect more stuff from her when she just falls short. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Y</span>/N<br>------------<br>ThAdmiral.... I remember him as the \"catch-up\" guy. I liked those catch-up posts, because Activity is Magic. Unfortunately the reality of the situation puts him at a null read. He ends up using the POE method to scumhunt (albeit wrongly; in terms of the result)<br>*ThAdmiral is a null read who ends up placing a vote on me which holds no water... Mafia? Y/<span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">N</span><br>(Doesn't feel like it &amp; I can't conclude anything based on what he has posted. Maybe I need to reread? Y/<span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">N</span>)<br>------------<br>Whiskers! This individual I do have a serious bone to pick with because he basically <span style=\"font-style: italic\">lied to himself</span>. Did you or did you not once said something along the lines of \"I do not use &lt;<span style=\"font-style: italic\">insert bad word here</span>&gt; readily\" or something similar along those lines? Did you or did you not repeat it at least twice in the last few pages? Yes, yes you did. This isn't good because if you're lying to yourself then there is no telling what you're doing to anypony else. Ergo, you <span style=\"font-style: italic\">canno</span>t be trusted. Granted, Beck also was in the frenzy of words but there is something about this exchange that is weird. Let me try to rationalize...<br><br>Whiskers said he isn't normally behaving like <span style=\"font-style: italic\">this</span> (read: use of foul language)<br>Only way he would be is when he gets emotional, right.<br>Well then where is the breaking point in the thread? I don't see anything that warrants its use...<br>So...<br>LIES.<br>But wait! Have I seen such a deception before?<br>Hmm...<br>Yes. I remember mentioning that playstyle shift thing and even voted him for that.

You're probably right about yourself and it is me who has faulty memory about your <span style=\"font-style: italic\">unladylike</span> behavior. This being the case, I apologize for accusing you of being a foul mouth (it very well could have been another player, I'm 99.99% sure it is this game. Heck, this is the only game I'm playing atm).

The nerve!<br>5) Beck is confirmed killing role with 0% chance of being Mafia because there has been 2 NKs each Night. And I think we really should be lynching Mafia Today, hmm? Hmm?<br>Oh and go ahead and give me <span style=\"font-style: italic\">your</span> read on a player who has not posted at all. Go ahead, because I sincerely don't know how to do it.

This is directed to no particular person; just felt like trying to explain some strange stuff since I started playing online Mafia.

This one is a flash game with Rainbow Dash playing any note you want her to on her guitar (like the song Clocks by Coldplay, for instance.

I reread the page previous to it, but I still don't know. I will explain it the best I can: <br><br>Rainbow Dash. Defending monk all day vehemently. To the point where it was irritating. I've had med-strong feeling about RD the whole game, thinking she's town, then no knowing and wondering if she's scum. I've been off and on, because I just don't know. She didn't want to lynch Mister Albert, an obviously scummy player. A player who was capable fully of playing better than he did I guess he did it to draw the nightkill? which worked? Still, I'd have liked to have been on his wagon when he was LYNCHED, not killed. <br>Currently, I am suspicious of Rainbowdash for being the only unknown in a voting block of one scum and one town. Two scum buddy up and pick a gullible townie to buddy with? Call it a town voting block? Sure. <br>This is subject to wifom and shit. Guilt by association, and I certainly can't tell you it's real. As usual, Rainbowdash remains a null-strong Town read to me. <br><br>monk. bad play and self contradictions. Both pointed out by Beck. Was also hard on theamateur, who was a town read for me. she was Beck's main and only suspect. Beck is pretty good as town, and had been a STRONG town read for MOST of Day 1. I wasn't confident of monkscum either. I was more sure than theamateurscum, but I was also sheeping Beck. I didn't see it super clearly myself. <br>Why Beck (who laid out most of my info on monk) is scummy now: He tunneled monk so hard D1 that he was left with nopony to accuse. monk was pretty strong, it seems, and at the very least had Rainbowdash backing her up all the time-- therefore, a great lynch to <span style=\"font-style: italic\">keep</span> pushing, even harder, and harder, and h<span style=\"font-style: italic\">harder</span>, because you know why? Scum doesn't want to lynch who they say is scum. Saying somepony who is unlikely to be lynched is scum is a great tactic. <br>Also, the bit about not killing monk is wifom. The major problem here is that he's an uncc'd vig, with an obvious secondary killing role. Town Beck and  Lonely Serial Killer Beck wouldn't make that monk kill, unless he's an SK sided with the mafia somehow, this doesn't make sense. Strong scum gut-feeling, but no good way for him to possibly be scum. <br><br>Albert B. Rampage. What do I need to say about him? I wish he'd been bitten by a snake and replaced out, but he didn't. Was he trying to draw the nightkill? apparently. I know <span style=\"font-style: italic\">I</span> wouldn't have killed him. I didn't see him as/didn't know/didn't care him as a Power Role, either. He was being a douche and since I said his play might be a scum gambit, it was ind of inviting him to come and play, now that he wouldn't be NK'd (because I called himj scummy, and keeping scummy players around is good for scum). <br><br>Rainbowdash and \"needs to Scootabus harder\"-- monk being the player I, at the time, wanted to lynch (at least over theamateur), I was saying Rainbowdash should stop defending her and vote for her instead. Turns out the wagon thing was Town x Town wagons, so all of you with town reads on one or the other were right about that. I had confused town reads on both, but they were the largest wagons, so there you go. <br><br>This adequate?"}

What in the hay is wrong with that? I can analyze stuff and make my own conclusions if the content available were little/massive and come to a conclusion of a Town/null/Mafia/etc. read. In other words, I can conclude that a player is Town based on little content the same way I cannot conclude anything i.e. null if a player posts massively.<br>In this case, my read was wrong.<br><br>Regarding the second part, please note your terrible misrep of my statement \"active lurking hard to judge\" statement, which was ended with a question mark.<br>You read it thinking I was accusing her of active lurking.<br>What I actually mean is \"Is the princess actually active lurking?

An active lurker will generally go on defensive mode when facing the threat of lynch. More often that not, these players are Mafia aligned.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Whiskers wrote:</cite>I apparently accused Charlie of sheeping (here, she claims she wasn't. Okay.)

That wasn't an accusation, that was a query (see the question mark --&gt; ?) When I made this post and the preceding one, I was on a mobile. Everything was condensed but I'm pretty sure the meaning didn't stray <span style=\"font-style: italic\">that</span> far. For the record, I don't remember if I thought you were tunneling back then; nor do I think it matters now.<br>Tunneling is when a player focus so much on getting  another player lynch that he or she loses focus of everypony else.

Well, guthrie barely posted for one thing, and the other stuff would have been tarsonis quoting posts that put her in a bad light while other wagons were going on. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3472973#p3472973\" class=\"postlink\">post 1091</a>, Rainbowdash wrote:</cite>Other things from Guthiere<br><br>He was part of the late D1 push on ABR for policy, which I still say has to has to be one of the worst wagons out there, and I would be stunned if only Tarson hopped on it as scum, especially with scum apparently killing ABR the first night.  Why not try and lynch somepony instead of use up a kill on them.</div></blockquote><br><br>Not necessarily, it was getting pressure and removing someone who wasn't posting any content. Guthrie barely votehopped. You have a terrible track record when it comes to voting, Dash, you have no right to talk. <br><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3472973#p3472973\" class=\"postlink\">post 1091</a>, Rainbowdash wrote:</cite>Guth also stayed on everypony for the most part always leaving his options open.  For Beck, this is what that type of play really looks like.  Guthiere showed at least a little (FoS or vote) mid to late day interest in lynching monk, theamature, ABR, Tarson, Whiskers and Beck (beck was improperly formatted).  That is everypony who had even a little suspicion on them.</div></blockquote><br>How about most posters or your own? This sort of reasoning can be applied to every game. No one sticks to one guy the entire day, sometimes voting strategically to see who sheeps you, etc. This applies to you, and even Beck who seemed to be stuck on Monk for 2 days.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3472973#p3472973\" class=\"postlink\">post 1091</a>, Rainbowdash wrote:</cite>Wagons up here everypony.  Also im going to call Whiskers probably town, and likely GLaDOS too, if Guthiere really is scum here.  He seemed pretty shell shocked that everypony talks as we do, and im expecting that Whiskers carries over pony speak to QT, as I would expect GLaDOS to.  I know I do.  Think its a mild tell, but it seemed like a genuine first time reaction to that type of speak.</div></blockquote><br><br>This part is most suspicious. Toss in two townies to vote for me, but trying to use heavy influence/friendship to influence votes? You have been doing this last day phase, and it is obvious that you carry some influence. But you went for the easy lynch, with a poor vote, trying to tag along with admiral. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3472973#p3472973\" class=\"postlink\">post 1091</a>, Rainbowdash wrote:</cite><br>Im already up later then I should be.

Its \"Called Tarson town\".  Yes I absolutely called Tarson town.  I called her town with quotes to back up my read the entire game because I was sure that she was town.

No.  Each point against you is the exact same thing worded differently to make it look like you have this \"mountain of evidence\" or something like that.<br>3) The role fishing has to do with role categories.  Killing, protective, investigative and other.  There are rarely multiple roles from the same category.  So far we have had one from each but protective claimed, what is scum going to fakeclaim?  Protective, but there is a full cop already flipped, so they would have to go weaker then that, so what are they going to claim?

It has been a while and I always give everypony the benefit of the doubt whenever they are in 'catch-up mode' and I'm still going to do just that. Get caught up soon, my dear.<br>2) I don't understand what Whiskers is rambling about. Perhaps you really do have a Pinkie Pie personality (of hyperactive/ADHD type). This is not an insult, it is an opinion.<br>3) I don't understand what in Equestria is Rainbowdash doing. I do have reserved opinions about this pony but I really want to... no, need to, get Applejack's opinions out there on the table first. See, I'm quite convinced of these:<br>i) ThAdmiral is Mafia<br>ii) One of Applejack/Rainbowdash is Mafia<br>iii) Whiskers is a wildcard:- she has such an erratic behavior which I can see Whiskers-Mafia make, but it seems.... too easy.<br><br>I need to validate ii) but it does not work with a one way conversation. I need everypony to lay their cards on the table before the magic of scumhunting by discussion will work. In the meantime, everypony (including you, Rainbowdash) go ISO Rainbowdash and take a good look at the posts she made in twilight. See if it makes sense.<br><br>4) I don't understand why ThAdmiral-Mafia isn't pushing harder for my lynch. But then again, I can't forsee what ThAdmiral-Mafia's strategy is. Oh well, doesn't really matter.<br><br>I... am also confused about some other thing, but I'll ask about it after the game is over.<br><br>Oh, and on side note, everypony go watch Lesson Zero.

To be honest, I shouldn't have accepted this replacement request given what was going on in my life, but I'm not replacing out now as that would just be a dick move. Please bear with me for just a couple of more days; I was able to get running reading the thread early this morning, and I think that if I manage my time wisely I'll be completely caught up by the middle of the week.<br><br>If you're interested in my thoughts as of right now, I think I left off at about page 10 (yes, I am <span style=\"font-style: italic\">that</span> bad), and I haven't been checking recent posts as they've been referencing different places in the thread that I'm not familiar with. To start off, I think I have a fairly good idea of who Rainbowdash is; if I am correct, then there's a few things that are on my mind regarding Rainbowdash. First, while I find it strange that Rainbowdash didn't question tarsonisocelot for giving her helm of the town voting bloc, Rainbowdash's explanation for why she believed that move from tarsonisocelot to come from town is highly consistent with something similar I saw [REDACTED] say as town. Since Rainbowdash is presumably a secret identity, there's no reason for me to worry about meta manipulation.<br><br>Second, I've been seeing claims that tarsonisocelot was lurking; if this is true, I find it difficult to believe that Rainbowdash wouldn't bus tarsonisocelot, a mere mafia goon, and would instead heavily defend tarsonisocelot to Rainbowdash's own detriment. I'm trying to investigate the general opinion around tarsonisocelot up to her lynch on Day 2 to see if there were indeed accusations of lurking, so I'll see pretty soon if my hypothesis here holds any water.<br><br>As for tarsonisocelot's lurking, I noted that Whiskers called out tarsonisocelot for lurking on September 3, one day after the thread opened. That rubs me the wrong way. Whiskers did this again early on September 4, as well, but she had reason to do so that time, since tarsonisocelot was seen in the \"Who Is Online\" feature. I'm interested now in seeing tarsonisocelot's behavior toward Whiskers as well as why GLaDOS strongly believed Whiskers to be town.<br><br>I don't have any comments right now toward Charlie and ThAdmiral, since right now I haven't gotten a proper grip on either from what I've read of Day 1 so far. What I will say, though, is that -- if I were to choose between their answers to my \"Why are you town?\" question earlier -- Charlie comes out the better of the two because his response was closer to my intent behind the question than ThAdmiral's was. I don't think Charlie got around to responding to my question if he does VCAs only as town, though.<br><br>Well, that turned out to be a huge post detailing why I haven't a clue. I'll be here all night and all morning. If any of y'all lovely ponies could fix me a fine and strong cup of coffee, that'd be real nice of ya."}

To start off, I think I have a fairly good idea of who Rainbowdash is; if I am correct, then there's a few things that are on my mind regarding Rainbowdash. First, while I find it strange that Rainbowdash didn't question tarsonisocelot for giving her helm of the town voting bloc, Rainbowdash's explanation for why she believed that move from tarsonisocelot to come from town is highly consistent with something similar I saw [REDACTED] say as town. Since Rainbowdash is presumably a secret identity, there's no reason for me to worry about meta manipulation..</div></blockquote><br>Aha!<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Applejack wrote:</cite>Second, I've been seeing claims that tarsonisocelot was lurking; if this is true, I find it difficult to believe that Rainbowdash wouldn't bus tarsonisocelot, a mere mafia goon, and would instead heavily defend tarsonisocelot to Rainbowdash's own detriment. I'm trying to investigate the general opinion around tarsonisocelot up to her lynch on Day 2 to see if there were indeed accusations of lurking, so I'll see pretty soon if my hypothesis here holds any water.</div></blockquote><br>And I'm expecting your analysis.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Applejack wrote:</cite>As for tarsonisocelot's lurking, I noted that Whiskers called out tarsonisocelot for lurking on September 3, one day after the thread opened. That rubs me the wrong way. Whiskers did this again early on September 4, as well, but she had reason to do so that time, since tarsonisocelot was seen in the \"Who Is Online\" feature. I'm interested now in seeing tarsonisocelot's behavior toward Whiskers as well as why GLaDOS strongly believed Whiskers to be town.</div></blockquote><br>Might not be the most reliable tell.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Applejack wrote:</cite>I don't have any comments right now toward Charlie and ThAdmiral, since right now I haven't gotten a proper grip on either from what I've read of Day 1 so far. What I will say, though, is that -- if I were to choose between their answers to my \"Why are you town?\" question earlier -- Charlie comes out the better of the two because his response was closer to my intent behind the question than ThAdmiral's was. I don't think Charlie got around to responding to my question if he does VCAs only as town, though.</div></blockquote><br>Frankly, this is the most important thing to comment on right now. At this point I've convinced that ThAdmiral is Mafia given the fact that there hasn't been a quickhammer already. That being the case, I'll be looking into who is most likely his partner + interactions with tarsonisocelot. If you're Town, don't hold back on saying what's on your mind; I'll scrutinize it. If you're Mafia then... well, here's hoping that you've slipped up somewhere.<br><br>Again, let me say why your not catching-up/providing content is detrimental to scumhunting: I'm working on the basis of one of Applejack/Rainbowdash is Mafia (with Whiskers as wildcard &amp; ThAdmiral as Mafia). I'd compare the actions/opinions of both but I keep finding my Applejack notes empty. I can say loads of stuff about Rainbowdash, but not Applejack and I'm fearful that if it turns out that it is Applejack-Mafia, then I'm being played as a tool. Make sense?<br><br>And I've rectified that last bit, albeit being confused about the nature of such a question.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Applejack wrote:</cite>Well, that turned out to be a huge post detailing why I haven't a clue.

I'll reread relevant portions of the thread later.<br><br>As a note to myself, I'm interested in looking closer that Charlie's and ThAdmiral's posts themselves, Charlie's and Rainbowdash's defenses, and probably Mist Beauty's twilight thoughts. I'll also take a gander at the voting spreadsheet to see if there's anything interesting there; I refuse to look at another VCA, though. Unfortunately, the NKs were mostly on power roles; Albert B. Rampage's soft claiming means I will not be able to determine if he was killed for his reads, his status in the game, or his soft claim, so I'm not happy about that.<br><br>For the record, I would have voted ThAdmiral. I agree with Whiskers that his suggestion that Beck shoot regardless of how Mist Beauty flipped was reckless. It's one thing to trust the kill to someone who is 100% town, but Beck was not going to have anything to keep him in check during the Night phase; when the game is decided by a group, the composition of the group isn't guaranteed, but there's less chance of the townies in the group screwing up due to checks and balances. This probably makes more sense in my head than written, but that's how I see it. Furthermore, Beck made it clear that he wanted to shoot Whiskers; if Whiskers is town -- and that's my belief at the moment -- ThAdmiral is scum for making this suggestion to Beck.<br><br>But I'm going to wait until I clear up the matter in the first paragraph before I make a final Applejack decision."}

Charlie was on record going after ThAdmiral in the event of a Mist Beauty-town flip, and ThAdmiral was on record going after Charlie in the event of a Mist Beauty-town flip. If either of them tried to go for Rainbowdash as soon as Day 4 started, there was a chance of someone noticing this; that chance was higher than usual given that I was still catching up, and I'd have a fresh perspective on the game. Therefore, they could have gone for consistency and bussed each other. The upside to this is that if either of them got lynched -- it's LyLo after all -- the other would suddenly be \"confirmed town,\" and Whiskers goes down because she's the pony nobody else really suspects.<br><br>I've stated over and over again how strong my Rainbowdash read is. The natural conclusion would be to just vote one of Charlie and ThAdmiral and be over with. The reason I haven't done so is because I'm still afraid of the possibility that Rainbowdash has the wool over my eyes. One of my greatest weaknesses in Mafia is that I am easily manipulated with WIFOM-type gambits; the reason I so strongly believe that Rainbowdash is town is itself due to WIFOM. I saw what tarsonisocelot was doing with Rainbowdash; the princess gave Rainbowdash the reins to a voting bloc, etc. Go back in my iso if you want this in more detail, since I can't be assed to rewrite the whole thing again. In summary, it paints a giant target on Rainbowdash's back.<br><br>But I am fearful enough of Rainbowdash's ability as scum. Since tarsonisocelot went and announced that she'd start a voting bloc before the game ever started, there was a possibility that she brought it up in her QuickTopic. If Rainbowdash is scum with her, I can definitely see Rainbowdash planning all of this out and manipulating the wine.<br><br>This is why I want to actually read certain things in the thread closer. There is so much wine swimming in my head right now, and I need to read these players much closer than I have while blitzing through this thread. This is LyLo; I am not going to decide a game while I'm drunk on possibilities and not sober on actual, solid reads of people. All I've got on ThAdmiral despite 59 pages of game is something about suggesting that Beck shoot. Don't get me starting on the blank nothing with microscopic dust bunnies that is Charlie.

Ergo, Whiskers the WILDCARD. Asking questions is difficult when I'm finding my hoof in contact to my face most of the time.<br><br>------------<br><br>OK, I'll let everypony in on a little secret. The whole point of waiting for Applejack to catch up was to see if she commits an IIoF (Information Instead of Analysis) tell, one scumtell which I find best used on replacements entering late game (based on personal experience). This didn't work because Whiskers pointed out all the key points in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3529293#p3529293\" class=\"postlink\">#1414</a> of which Applejack should have analysed and not regurgitate (great job, Whiskers). Applejack subsequently <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3530560#p3530560\" class=\"postlink\">admits that she should have asked for this a long time ago</a>, which was EXACTLY what I was thinking of: Why didn't she just ask?<br><br>Moving on, she <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3531212#p3531212\" class=\"postlink\">mentions a strong Town read on both Whiskers &amp; Rainbowdash</a> when she was reading page 19, and this <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3534986#p3534986\" class=\"postlink\">carried forward</a> until she finished. This I find to be very strange because, well, reads are supposed to change over time adding in the new factors, unless there is another justification for it which I don't see. It feels like there is a gap in your reads. The final conclusion post just didn't have much conviction to it, which I fully expect after having so long to read. Since you've said you'll reread relevant portions of the thread later, I'll be expecting more stuff from you.<br><br>On a side note, you've mentioned Newbie 1040... which was about 2 years ago. A very early game. Wow, looking back I don't remember much details, but reading it I find you goofed up and helped lynched me D1 and got killed off N1. Nothing much to say about meta that long ago because I feel that I was a different player back then than I am now, so you can draw your on conclusions.<br><br>On another side note, I think we'll need to have a chat about posting from a mobile device postgame.<br><br>------------<br><br>Now, I deal with Rainbowdash. Ha, I've not forgotten about you. I've mentioned that I'll deal with you later, and that later is now! Since we'll be lynching ThAdmiral-Mafia Today and there is a fair chance that I'll not be allowed to live for Tomorrow's LyLo, I can't afford to hold back any information in the form of my notes.<br><br>Here are significant findings (no URLs, these I gotta quote):<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3484110#p3484110\" class=\"postlink\">post 1219</a>, Rainbowdash wrote:</cite>Beck, please settle here.<br><br>Mist is the lynch.

But like I said, you are right; instead of being useless I should be working to convince you to vote him instead of just hoping you'll vote him.<br>So I did look back briefly and here are a few things I found:<br>1. Charlie voted you for the ridiculous reason of changing your playstyle (post 406). As I said at the time the shift was entirely for the better. Completely contrived reason to vote someone.<br>2. Charlie's list of town to scum was strange to say the least (post 653). First of all there was little to no explanation. Second of all it gave the number one spot away for \"honory\" reasons to Glados, it had perennial catch up merchant (i.e. myself) at 2, trolling ABR at 3, scum tarsonis at 4, obvtown beck at 10, malpascp at 11 for the cop-out reason of lurking, and yourself at 12 (the bottom spot) for \"playstyle, anti-wincon, vote-patterns\".<br>3. He hammered mist after she claimed doc. I don't believe no one else see's this the way I do. As soon as that happened I had charlie pegged as obvscum.<br><br>If this is not enough I'll do a proper ISO and see if there are any links between him and tarsonis.

I agree with Whiskers that his suggestion that Beck shoot regardless of how Mist Beauty flipped was reckless. It's one thing to trust the kill to someone who is 100% town, but Beck was not going to have anything to keep him in check during the Night phase; when the game is decided by a group, the composition of the group isn't guaranteed, but there's less chance of the townies in the group screwing up due to checks and balances.

Mist Beauty flipped Town therefore ThAdmiral is Mafia.<br>I think you just don't care about my answers, or are intentionally ignoring them, Whiskers. This is very scummy in my books, and your wildcard status has been demoted (promoted?) into scummy status. Don't let this bother you, but I'm going to say now that you're just as likely to be Mafia as RD/AJ now. This makes it RD/AJ/PP which makes it everypony! Whee!

Seems to me that Rainbowdash bought Pinkie Pie's (Whisker's) trust for $0.99. Now since I know these two are not scum together, I'm utterly confused right now.<span style=\"color: #FF00BF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Rainbow Dash hardly has my trust. I mean, Rainbow Dash is not the best liar, but this player isn't playing her quite exactly so I really can't give her a 100% clear. Right now though, I've decided that she's probably only scum if she's scum partners with you. </span></span><br><br>Whiskers, I don't understand why, and when, did you about turn on your reads on myself and Thadmiral. Last I thought you were sensible enough to think ThAdmiral is the correct lynch. Then you voted for me, unvoted, then when I replied to everything you threw it away and threatened a melodramatic vote.<span style=\"color: #FF00BF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">When did I do that? <br><br>No, no, ThAdmiral is still the lynch. I voted/unvoted you because I was testing Rainbowdash and Applejack. Actually, that's the reason why she could only be scum with you-- If RainbowDash and ThAdmiral were scum, she would have hammered you, winning the game. If Dashie and Applejack were scum, then she would have hammered you, winning the game. If Rainbow dash and <span style=\"font-style: italic\">I</span> were scum, we would have ended the game a long time ago. </span></span><br><br>I give up trying to understand you, Whiskers. Each time, despite much restrain, I find myself burying my head in disappointment over the things that you say or do. I make myself feel better by throwing away my original principle of 'give everyone the benefit of the doubt first'. I then replace it with my principle of how to behave while driving on the road, one which has kept me accident free. And that principle is 'assume that everyone else on the road is a dumbass'. I feel much better. <span style=\"color: #FF00BF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Walking makes Pinkie Pie a healthy pony.</span></span><br><br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_D7Ov0xKts\" class=\"postlink\">I'm so pathetic</a>.<br><br>Answers to Whiskers in chronology:<br>1. What is the point of pointing out syntax?<span style=\"color: #FF00BF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">I actually take this back, since you were arguing syntax with syntax. However, rather than saying, \"It doesnt' matter what termonology I used\", You say, \"Oh, okay, I <span style=\"font-style: italic\">know</span> then.\" </span></span><br>2. Not others having points, strong or not... ME deciding that everyone else has scum points. Not you, but me. Your opinion =/= my opinion. <span style=\"color: #FF00BF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Oh Rarity! If you don't want to be lynched, shouldn't you want to make me <span style=\"font-style: italic\">share</span> your opinion? <br>And, as the element of Generosity, shouldn't <span style=\"font-style: italic\">you</span> want to <span class=\"noboldsig\">share your opinion</span>? </span></span><br>1. You put a sarcastic remark here yet answered my sarcastic question in the next line, making me think that you're either not good at sarcasm or you're not good at sarcasm. <span style=\"color: #FF00BF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">What about this-- what you said, I mean-- was sarcastic? <br>The point has been there forever. (Not Sarcastic?) <br>He's repeating it (Not Sarcastic?) <br>It's been discussed to death (Not Sarcastic?) </span></span>On a serious note, what do you want to discuss about this, and would me saying stuff really make you change your mind about this one issue?<span style=\"color: #FF00BF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"> I dunno. &lt;3</span></span><br>2. Answering my question with <span style=\"font-style: italic\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">You would do that if you were scum, that's why you would do that.</span></span> makes me facehoof. <span style=\"color: #FF00BF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">You said, \"Either Something, or I'm lying! Why would I lie!?\" And you would lie if you're scum. Of course, the other thing could be <span style=\"font-style: italic\">totally</span> possible too, right? </span></span>Asking me again that question, to which I've answered so many many many times, its because of my VCA which indicates that one of ThAdmiral/Mist Beauty is Mafia. Mist Beauty flipped Town therefore ThAdmiral is Mafia. <span style=\"color: #FF00BF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Well, link me to your VCA when you get the time, okay? *wink!*</span></span><br>I think you just don't care about my answers, or are intentionally ignoring them, Whiskers. This is very scummy in my books, and your wildcard status has been demoted (promoted?) into scummy status. Don't let this bother you, but I'm going to say now that you're just as likely to be Mafia as RD/AJ now. This makes it RD/AJ/PP which makes it everypony! Whee! Thank you for making yourself so difficult, Whiskers! <span style=\"color: #FF00BF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">I dunno, I <span style=\"font-style: italic\">like</span> a good challenge. Why do you think I spend so much time with Fluttershy? </span></span><br><br>Forgive my ramblings.

I maintain that I did not quickhammer, I was certain with like 99% certainly that Mist Beauty would flip Mafia at that point.

She claimed without a night action because she didn't <span style=\"font-style: italic\">make</span> a night action. 9__9 This isn't that hard.

If Charlie is scum, I would be about ready to bet the farm on Whiskers being town too.</div></blockquote><br>1. My Town read on Tarson was early in the game where I wanted to see a voting bloc work out... in hindsight, this was what probably blinded me because I've seen it work before in a game I read, never thought of the idea of Mafia being so bold as to actually take control of one. This read and carried forward till the start of D2.<br><br>That's how it is. I've made a poor choice, one that I'm quite bitter about myself but I just move on.<br><br>2. When I analyzed the VCA, it DID clear Whiskers but again I don't rely on a logic tell alone. I play with logic, gut &amp; meta. In LyLo, based on experience, gut is the way to go.

It strikes me as odd but somehow I get a weird sense of clarity when you mentioned things like a party, chocolate chip cookies, sarsaparilla, cupcakes and hot sauce. I realize that the rainbow pony and the party pony are both friends because they are pranksters.<br><br>And I certainly don't understand how Applejack concluded that Whiskers is Town after she played like a hyperactive squirrel on 10 gallons of coffee. ThAdmiral can label Whiskers anyhow he wants to because of his alignment.<br><br>So I leave you with a question that I find myself asking myself: Why am I the only pony who's having suspicion on Whiskers?"}

Scum have a vested interest in alienating town from the thread, and if it is a real 1:1, they would lose the game if they couldn't argue themselves to victory; therefore, they'd be spamming evidence against the other 1:1 player. Town would have difficulty ignoring that; while they have the option of saying they'll ignore the walls, they're still going to have difficulty resisting responding to the other 1:1's obviously false accusations.<br><br>The thought I was running with this morning was that both Charlie and ThAdmiral seemed relatively dispassionate compared to the 3p LyLo phases I've seen where somebody has to actually post to ask the two people in the 1:1 to shut up. I didn't have time to fully go through their iso, so I planned to ask for their meta so that I could take a look if they had any to offer and compare the games to this game. Instead, there's no meta, and I fell asleep(!), so here I am. I'll find out if I'm just spouting random things when I'm done reading (TODAY because there's no way in hell I'm spending my Wednesday evening on this) or if I'm onto something here.<br><br>At this point, I'm certain it's Charlie-ThAdmiral. ThAdmiral's response to my probing in post 1475 is a bad response; ThAdmiral said, definitively, that he didn't think Beck didn't shoot, not that he wish Beck did if it wasn't going to be Whiskers. Post 1313 and post 1494 are like the dartboard and dart, except the dart's completely missed the board. Also, Rainbowdash didn't hammer Charlie for the win when Whiskers moved her vote, which seals the deal for me. I'm stalling this game because I want to find evidence against Charlie before the Day ends, and I admit the thing above was me doing that.<br><br>But here's what I'm going to do. I have a midterm on Thursday, and I want to actually study for that thing lest I flunk it; I will not be failing exams on account of this game. I have a few hours before I have to leave for classes. I'm going to spend this time now reading this game and then posting my \"thoughts\" on it. \"But 'thoughts' are in quotes, Applejack!\" (Read that in a Rarity accent; I did.) Yes, because the crux of my thoughts are in the paragraph above; what you're essentially getting from me from now on are pre-3p LyLo arguments. If I don't finish, you're getting whatever is running through my head; if I finish, you get the same thing but more complete. And then I vote, and I'm forgetting this game's existence for 4 days."}

Thad is not by any means out of the question as a partner, but I really am thinking he is town in all of this who more or less got stuck on Charlie for the wrong reason, as seriously, I would have hammered Mist right there too if I had the chance.  BG who decided not to catch up after the game went to night?  Seems too incomprehensable that a town protective role would at least not skim the game for a town leader role and jump on them.  Lack of N1 protect target in the claim too, sounded bad.<br><br>Anyways, I think its AJ given the way today was apporached by both ponies.  AJ while catching up continues to seem to lean to Thad for who she thought was scum.  While I dont have a problem with this too much, she also seemed somewhat convinced that it was Charlie and Thad together.  I feel that I at least somewhat conclusively proved it was not Whiskers from early on, and there was very little interest in me, enough to show subtle nods but not enough to do anything drastic.  Problem there is, if its Thad-Charlie, why so much hesitance to actually vote Charlie?  I just kinda got the feeling that she was just waiting to see if anypony would throw a wrong vote out there, by comitting slightly to Thad, but still staying enough on Charlie to not look wierd jumping on him.<br><br>What I also dont get is how my \"Its not Thad-AJ\" mini case was actually what broke her to vote Charlie.  Its not like it disproved anything to her if she is town.  And I have no idea how thats a \"get out of jail free\" card or anything of that sort.  Seems like what I put up would be what breaks Whiskers who was leaning Thad to come over to Charlie, not somepony who was actually in the pairing I tried to disprove.<br><br>Food for thought.<br><br>I don't want to get into a massive debate since its going to cause even more WIFOM than this post im sure already is going to, but I just am getting a little nervous that its going to be missed in part if not whole if I dont do anything about it now.<br><br>@Whiskers - If you want to get a little post up to before you hammer on why you seem to think Thad go for it.  Im ready for you to  hammer at this point though.  If you dont by Friday night I will do so myself then."}

I still have town reads of Whiskers and Rainbowdash for essentially the same reasons I've stated already in the thread, and I would have sworn my life on them except Rainbowdash brought up something really interesting about the Charlie-ThAdmiral pair earlier in the Day. If Rainbowdash is town, Mist Beauty's accusations over twilight would have made it easy for scum to put Rainbowdash up as an option in LyLo, but instead we have Charlie and ThAdmiral going at each other's throats. Granted, the two of them were already doing it as the Day was ending, but the justification that Mist Beauty gave was pretty big. I just spent close to 12 hours reading this thread non-stop, so I'm tuckered out and would like to take a break. I'll reread relevant portions of the thread later.<br><br>As a note to myself, I'm interested in looking closer that Charlie's and ThAdmiral's posts themselves, Charlie's and Rainbowdash's defenses, and probably Mist Beauty's twilight thoughts. I'll also take a gander at the voting spreadsheet to see if there's anything interesting there; I refuse to look at another VCA, though. Unfortunately, the NKs were mostly on power roles; Albert B. Rampage's soft claiming means I will not be able to determine if he was killed for his reads, his status in the game, or his soft claim, so I'm not happy about that.<br><br>For the record, I would have voted ThAdmiral. I agree with Whiskers that his suggestion that Beck shoot regardless of how Mist Beauty flipped was reckless. It's one thing to trust the kill to someone who is 100% town, but Beck was not going to have anything to keep him in check during the Night phase; when the game is decided by a group, the composition of the group isn't guaranteed, but there's less chance of the townies in the group screwing up due to checks and balances. This probably makes more sense in my head than written, but that's how I see it. Furthermore, Beck made it clear that he wanted to shoot Whiskers; if Whiskers is town -- and that's my belief at the moment -- ThAdmiral is scum for making this suggestion to Beck.<br><br>But I'm going to wait until I clear up the matter in the first paragraph before I make a final Applejack decision.</div></blockquote><br><br>Applejack pushin' ThAd an' Char go free <br>Matching up her focus with a silvertongued Rarity. <br>Hoofin' up a line with her active lurking <br>I spit it 'cause I get it, makes sense to me. <br><br>Still not quite clear though, wanna call out on a bus <br>Where ThAd and Rarity scuff and tussle. <br>Whatya gonna do 'til ya give it that muscle? <br>Hammer on the horn and tomorrow check the shuffle. <br><br><br>Fun fact: As of right now, Applejack has said \"Charlie\" and \"ThAd\" 53 times a piece.

Don't misrep!<br>------------<br>Ah, I remember GLaDOS was a Town read because of meta: same here, same then. However between Whiskers &amp; Beck &amp; some other people posting stuff &amp; stuff &amp; stuff in thread making the game move at breakneck speed, I feel that this read gradually diminishes into a null read because the level of goodposting gets diluted. Make sense? Yes. Yes it does.<br>*GLaDOS is likely Mafia until the level of goodposting increases to match. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Y</span>/N<br>------------<br>I've mentioned that Rainbowdash was difficult to read... yes, it's all true.. so I opted a very different and (arguably) unusual method: I did a search post by user and actually read her stuff (it's still meta). The end result I see is a more passive pony playstyle which is very odd. I can't discuss ongoing games but I did quiz her in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3416171#p3416171\" class=\"postlink\">ISO#17</a> about a completed one. Didn't really get anything from that.<br>*Rainbowdash is likely Mafia because she failed to out-talk the talk in this fast game i.e. one would expect more stuff from her when she just falls short. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Y</span>/N<br>------------<br>ThAdmiral.... I remember him as the \"catch-up\" guy. I liked those catch-up posts, because Activity is Magic. Unfortunately the reality of the situation puts him at a null read. He ends up using the POE method to scumhunt (albeit wrongly; in terms of the result)<br>*ThAdmiral is a null read who ends up placing a vote on me which holds no water... Mafia?

Did you or did you not once said something along the lines of \"I do not use &lt;<span style=\"font-style: italic\">insert bad word here</span>&gt; readily\" or something similar along those lines? Did you or did you not repeat it at least twice in the last few pages? Yes, yes you did. This isn't good because if you're lying to yourself then there is no telling what you're doing to anypony else. Ergo, you <span style=\"font-style: italic\">canno</span>t be trusted. Granted, Beck also was in the frenzy of words but there is something about this exchange that is weird. Let me try to rationalize...<br><br>Whiskers said he isn't normally behaving like <span style=\"font-style: italic\">this</span> (read: use of foul language)<br>Only way he would be is when he gets emotional, right.<br>Well then where is the breaking point in the thread? I don't see anything that warrants its use...<br>So...<br>LIES.<br>But wait! Have I seen such a deception before?<br>Hmm...<br>Yes. I remember mentioning that playstyle shift thing and even voted him for that. I hold it to be true, even though what ThAdmiral said as a counterpoint remains to be true.<br><br>So, does this explain things swimmingly? No? Then forget it, my gut says Whiskers isn't Town<br>*Whiskers is scum because of behavior I find erratic. But the VCA I did says the opposite. This means there is a conflict between my logic side of my brain and the gut side of.... waitaminute. This is ridiculous. Anyway. When this problem occurs, I'd normally go with gut read. Whiskers is Mafia. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Y</span>/N<br>------------<br>Um, okay, who else? Beck? Well, a claimed vig...could be SK...

I know you stated before that you doubt there's any scum motivation behind him making his post, but that is not my point. My point here is that, in trying to offer a piece of his mind, ThAdmiral accidentally let slip that his teammate roleblocked Beck on Night 3. Beck had very clearly stated before nightfall that he was not going to shoot if Mist Beauty flipped town; there was no reason to speculate whether he did or did not shoot. Furthermore, ThAdmiral did not even speculate about the possibility of a roleblocker in the setup when town would have said something about their post being speculation.<br><br>When I <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3545984#p3545984\" class=\"postlink\">confronted him</a> with this and accused either him or Charlie of roleblocking Beck, he specifically denies: <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3546087#p3546087\" class=\"postlink\">\"No, <span class=\"noboldsig\">I</span> did not block Beck last Night.\"</a> When I asked him about this post the first time, his response was that <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3535698#p3535698\" class=\"postlink\">he wished Beck had shot</a>. The second time I asked him to explain the slip, he beat around the bush instead of directly address the problems with his post 1313 with a question about why he would assume that Beck had made a shot, quoted below.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3546087#p3546087\" class=\"postlink\">post 1642</a>, ThAdmiral wrote:</cite>No I didn't block beck last night. Even if I somehow did block beck why would I then automatically know he didn't shoot. If anything I would have assumed he did shoot?</div></blockquote><br>Aside from the obvious that a roleblocker really couldn't assume either way anyway, let's take a look at the diction of the post that was in discussion.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3502105#p3502105\" class=\"postlink\">post 1313</a>, ThAdmiral wrote:</cite>I don't believe beck didn't shoot. Although if he was going to shoot whiskers it's probably for the best.</div></blockquote><br>\"I don't believe Beck didn't shoot.\" This sounds like he believed that Beck tried to shoot. As a <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3502105#p3502105\" class=\"postlink\">claimed innocent townie</a>, he could not have possibly assumed Beck tried to shoot because:<br><br><ol style=\"list-style-type: decimal\"><li> the obvious conclusion for any townie <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3488092#p3488092\" class=\"postlink\">reading Beck's second-to-last post in the game</a> would be that <span style=\"font-style: italic\">Beck did not shoot</span>, and</li><li> no townie thinks \"Beck probably tried to shoot!\" when there's no second flip and no evidence of a roleblocker.</li></ol>A townie may feel certain that there is some sort of roleblocking power on the scum's side given the flipped town power, but there will always be an air of uncertainty when they talk setup. Furthermore, Occam's razor takes us right back to the first point: There was no reason for Beck to renege on his promise.<br><br>The part about ThAdmiral wishing Beck shot is a load of horseapples that is not even an approximation of the above post. If you wish something happened, you don't say, \"I don't think it happened!\" You say, \"I wish it did happen.\"<br><br><div align=\"center\"><hr style=\"height:14px; width:50%\"></div>If the above partial wall was not enough of a dealbreaker, I've got more.<br><br>I will reiterate why I am not scum with Charlie. I had a case on ThAdmiral toward the end of Day 4, and Whiskers was willing to vote ThAdmiral. If I were scum, it would have been a very simple matter to lynch ThAdmiral instead of Charlie. In that situation, while I would still benefit from town cred I would gain on Day 5 by bussing Charlie, it would have taken far less effort to just convince one player to vote ThAdmiral with me and end the game on Day 4. Charlie was the more difficult lynch, and the person who wanted to lynch Charlie -- you -- had already made it clear during Whiskers's voting gambit that you were not a hasty voter and would take everything into consideration, including the nature of the Charlie vote itself. From Applejack-scum's point-of-view, it would  have been easier to just win the game than pull off an elaborate bus.<br><br>\"Wait, Applejack. You pushed through a Charlie lynch first anyway. You're serving me one of your apple ciders, and they're the alcoholic kind!\"<br><br>Yes, I am evil and manipulative, and a lot of things in this post are WIFOM. However, something you should know about me is that I play to win. I don't play to look clever, nor do I play for some twisted glory of winning despite handicapping myself. If there is a way to win, I will absolutely take it and run. I don't need town cred when there's an easy lynch in front of me that would directly lead to a win.<br><br>However, the truth is that I am not scum, and I actually do need town cred going into Day 5 or else I lose the game. The case you made for the scum team not being Applejack-ThAdmiral was the catalyst for me in deciding to lynch Charlie first. I realized that the difficulty in getting Charlie lynched relative to ThAdmiral could help me turn the tables; if I could convince whoever was going to be with me on Day 5 that Applejack-scum could have just won the game by lynching ThAdmiral-town first, then I would have a fighting chance in this second LyLo."}

I personally don't think that qualifies as Normal unless it is considered a variant role, in which case the Town should have been told something other than \"Neighborizer\" for your role.

I was under the impression that neighborizers dying as a result of targeting mafia was pretty common and even mentioned in the wiki, but now that I look back at the wiki article for neighborizers, it doesn't mention anything about this variation, so I guess I was mistaken. Oh well. I targeted Rainbow specifically because I thought there was a fairly decent chance she was mafia. If I had realized that there was such a small chance that people would look into who I might have targetted, I probably would have picked Glados instead. Of course, it wouldn't have mattered, since I was shot anyway.<br><br>Anyhow, I don't feel like this was a strong game on my part at all. By the end of Day 1 I didn't really have any strong reads.

Choosing to not shoot night 3 meant you were fine with being NKed, but I guess it's a good thing as you were gunning for whiskers over RD.<br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>What hurt the game was the bodyguard flaking, I'm curious to know what happened n2 with regards to that action (maybe it was mentioned already?)</div></blockquote><br>It was bad that I didn't protect the cop, but I replaced in late into the night when some personal stuff was going on(reason why I didn't start posting furiously as I entered), and honestly didn't have time to read the game. Scum complained a little bit that setup was town favored, but I guess that it was evened out as town essentially didn't have a BG. I actually don't feel bad about this due to solid reads this game and handing the town the rest of the scumteam on a silver platter."}
