Either one feels like a role when you consider the fact that Town go after Town more than they do mafia. Even as Town, I still need to get people to believe I'm Town and keep mafia from wanting to night kill me. In some ways, I think playing as mafia is easier for people that are good at playing people against each other and can be consistent at the same time. Either way, we're all playing roles.<br>\n<br>\n2. ...depends on a lot of things. Some people will get ideas about other players and go after them the whole game, only to find out they were town. I don't collaborate with those people. I also prefer to keep my cards close to my chest and vote when I see weird interactions happening. I think other Townies won't like this because it means I'm going to vote more on intuition and not going with the wagon if I feel reservations about the lynch.<br>\n<br>\n3. I don't think it really matters much. Anybody can play any way they like and it doesn't mean someone is mafia just because they don't fit a certain personality or role that is typical for a Townie.

I doubt you disagree with this concept.<br>\n<br>\nYour posting seems to indicate that you found the random questions and the answering thereof to be a positive thing.  Presumably, this means that you consider them to in some way advance the game, which you seem to understand is something that happens through reading people.  Would you therefore say that it is your belief that these questions in some way help to read anyone?  If so, what reads have you gained from it and what about it gave you those reads?<br>\n<br>\nWhen I asked you about your reads, you seemed to believe that this made me likely scum.  Now, scummy and anti-town aren't the same thing, but it seems likely in this case that you found it scummy at least partly because you did think it was anti-town.  Is this correct?<br>\n<br>\nNow, if the contentions in the previous two paragraph thingies are correct (i.e. that you found answering the questions to be a positive and that you found asking for reads to be anti-town), it would seem reasonable to conclude that you find more value in non-game-specific questions than you do in discussing reads.

DeathRowKitty's feud would look a lot more suspicious if she wasn't the first to start piling on Cheetory; but what really strikes me as the Mafiaest post so far (and that's a pretty low bar) is <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9278759#p9278759\" class=\"postlink\">Klick calling for a quicklynch on Cheetory</a>.<br>\n<br>\nI'm sure Mafia would <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">love</div> a quicklynch on Day One.

I hate it when players justify a read by implying that \"If there not scum then they're bad town\". Its like distancing oneself from the cadaver.<br>\n<br>\nThe thing is that I see this behavior from inexperienced players trying to convince themselves and others that they are right.

Either one of them could you know, alleviate my concern instead of dodging it and implying that I'm dumb. But then they would actually have to participate.<br>\n<br>\nThough admittedly, DRKs read of Gamma is pretty legit. Gamma is certainly playing in a way that keeps his options open and I find that a bit scummy.

Though yeah, I'm a little annoyed at DRK, but it's more because she is being hypocritical and dodgy, as well as Paul.<br>\n<br>\nAs I said to Paul<br>\n\"If you know it takes time to judge a player's beginning behavior and DRK is doing the opposite, why is that not setting off any alarms, but my picking up on it somehow does? This makes zero sense.\"<br>\n<br>\nHis answer is \"I don't scumread him\". So he's not even addressing my concern. And taking the same scummy stance as DRK in doing so. Either one of them could you know, alleviate my concern instead of dodging it and implying that I'm dumb.

I doubt you disagree with this concept.<br>\n<br>\nYour posting seems to indicate that you found the random questions and the answering thereof to be a positive thing.  Presumably, this means that you consider them to in some way advance the game, which you seem to understand is something that happens through reading people.  Would you therefore say that it is your belief that these questions in some way help to read anyone?  If so, what reads have you gained from it and what about it gave you those reads?<br>\n<br>\nWhen I asked you about your reads, you seemed to believe that this made me likely scum.  Now, scummy and anti-town aren't the same thing, but it seems likely in this case that you found it scummy at least partly because you did think it was anti-town.  Is this correct?<br>\n<br>\nNow, if the contentions in the previous two paragraph thingies are correct (i.e. that you found answering the questions to be a positive and that you found asking for reads to be anti-town), it would seem reasonable to conclude that you find more value in non-game-specific questions than you do in discussing reads.

I doubt you disagree with this concept.<br>\n<br>\nYour posting seems to indicate that you found the random questions and the answering thereof to be a positive thing.  Presumably, this means that you consider them to in some way advance the game, which you seem to understand is something that happens through reading people.  Would you therefore say that it is your belief that these questions in some way help to read anyone?  If so, what reads have you gained from it and what about it gave you those reads?<br>\n<br>\nWhen I asked you about your reads, you seemed to believe that this made me likely scum.  Now, scummy and anti-town aren't the same thing, but it seems likely in this case that you found it scummy at least partly because you did think it was anti-town.  Is this correct?<br>\n<br>\nNow, if the contentions in the previous two paragraph thingies are correct (i.e. that you found answering the questions to be a positive and that you found asking for reads to be anti-town), it would seem reasonable to conclude that you find more value in non-game-specific questions than you do in discussing reads.

Either one of them could you know, alleviate my concern instead of dodging it and implying that I'm dumb. But then they would actually have to participate.<br>\n<br>\nThough admittedly, DRKs read of Gamma is pretty legit.

So while he was catching up b4 his readlist, he called CCC out (kinda) saying he thought he was rolefishing, but lo and behold he is one of his top town reads when the list is out.

Make your case. And being dodgy by not answering questions directly or replying with condescension is pretty shitty. Talking pr roles in day 1 when you don't even need to is pretty shitty.

This shows me you know how a Town should scumhunt, but you, as mafia, have no problem doing the opposite.

My scumreads are still light - but nonetheless, his was the strongest. At that time, however, I hadn't voted for him, because he'd softed a PR - and the last thing I want to do is lynch a genuine Town Power Role.<br>\n<br>\nNow, let's consider some maths.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display: inline; color:#000000 !important; background:#000000 !important; padding:0px 3px;\" title=\"This text is hidden to prevent spoilers; to reveal, highlight it with your cursor.\">We have thirteen players, and for the moment I will assume three Mafia. Let me go further and assume two Town PRs. Then the field would consist of:<br>\n<br>\nMafiax3<br>\nTown PRx2<br>\nVanilla Towniex8<br>\n<br>\nNow, NotTheRealPaul must fit into one of these categories; that is, he is either Mafia, or Town PR, or Vanilla Townie. Before taking into account any scumminess in his posts, the base probabilites of each group are approx. 23% chance of Mafia, 15% chance of Town PR, and 62% chance of Vanilla Townie. But he felt some pressure, and softed a Town PR role. This changes things.<br>\n<br>\nSpecifically; Mafia can claim either a Vanilla Townie role, or a Town PR role. Let's assume that Town roles never lie; and Mafia roles have a 50% chance of pretending to be a Vanilla Townie, and a 50% chance of pretending to be a Town PR. So. We know that he has softed a Town PR. What is he, really?<br>\n<br>\nHe cannot be a Vanilla Townie, because Vanilla Townies do not lie by softing a PR. He is therefore either Mafia, or a Town PR. What I want to know, therefore, is the probability (before factoring in any scumminess in his posts) that he is Mafia, *given* that he softed a Town PR. Using Bayes' Theroem:<br>\n<br>\nP(Mafia | Softed PR) = P(softed PR | Mafia)*P(Mafia)/P(Softed PR)<br>\n<br>\nP(Softed PR) = 2/13+(0.5*3/13) = 7/26<br>\nP(Mafia) = 3/13<br>\nP(softed PR | Mafia) = 0.5<br>\n<br>\nThus, P(Mafia | Softed PR) = (3/36)/(/7/26) = 3/7 = approx. 43% (with the remaining 57% going to the odds of being a genuine PR)</div><br>\n<br>\nAll the working (including the assumptions I made to get there) is in the spoiler, but, long version short; before considering any other scumminess in his post, looking only at the fact that of the PR claim, and not even considering its timing; his odds of being Mafia went up from 23% to 43% - mainly because he cut out the chances of being a vanilla Townie (I'm assuming Townies wouldn't lie about that). At the same time, however, his odds of being a genuine PR went up - from about 15% to around 57%.<br>\n<br>\nNow, on the basis of the 57% chance of being a genuine PR, I had originally decided I shouldn't vote him - despite him still being my top scumread. Mainly because losing a PR would be a disaster, while losing a Vanilla Townie - well, it wouldn't exactly be <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">great</div>, but it would be a good deal less bad. However, MuttonChopMagic bought up a good point - that, by refusing to vote for someone merely because he softed a PR, I would be setting a bad precedent for the future.<br>\n<br>\nI considered his point. What harm could my vote do? It could be a part of a lynch on NotTheRealPaul. But we were a long way from there. To even reach L-1, at least two other Townies would need to vote with me - and an actual lynch would require the aid of at least one more Townie on top of that.<br>\n<br>\nIt could put enough pressure on him to force him to claim. Forcing a PR to claim is a bad thing, because the Mafia then know who to target at night. But... he'd already softed his PR. Mafia already know who he is. Him suddenly jumping up and saying \"I'm the Cop\" or \"I'm the Doctor\" or whatever isn't going to make things a one bit worse - Mafia don't currently know <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">what</div> role he is, but they do know <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">who</div> softed a PR, and - well, that's pretty bad, but that's also <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">done</div>. There's no putting the genie back in the bottle now.<br>\n<br>\nSo, in the end, I concluded that there was minimal danger in voting for my top scumread, despite his claim, and promptly did so.", "time": "Wed Jun 07, 2017 6:46 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=72052&start=500", "forum": "53", "thread": "72052"}

At that time, however, I hadn't voted for him, because he'd softed a PR - and the last thing I want to do is lynch a genuine Town Power Role.<br>\n<br>\nNow, let's consider some maths.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: </b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\">We have thirteen players, and for the moment I will assume three Mafia. Let me go further and assume two Town PRs. Then the field would consist of:<br>\n<br>\nMafiax3<br>\nTown PRx2<br>\nVanilla Towniex8<br>\n<br>\nNow, NotTheRealPaul must fit into one of these categories; that is, he is either Mafia, or Town PR, or Vanilla Townie. Before taking into account any scumminess in his posts, the base probabilites of each group are approx. 23% chance of Mafia, 15% chance of Town PR, and 62% chance of Vanilla Townie. But he felt some pressure, and softed a Town PR role. This changes things.<br>\n<br>\nSpecifically; Mafia can claim either a Vanilla Townie role, or a Town PR role. Let's assume that Town roles never lie; and Mafia roles have a 50% chance of pretending to be a Vanilla Townie, and a 50% chance of pretending to be a Town PR. So. We know that he has softed a Town PR. What is he, really?<br>\n<br>\nHe cannot be a Vanilla Townie, because Vanilla Townies do not lie by softing a PR. He is therefore either Mafia, or a Town PR. What I want to know, therefore, is the probability (before factoring in any scumminess in his posts) that he is Mafia, *given* that he softed a Town PR. Using Bayes' Theroem:<br>\n<br>\nP(Mafia | Softed PR) = P(softed PR | Mafia)*P(Mafia)/P(Softed PR)<br>\n<br>\nP(Softed PR) = 2/13+(0.5*3/13) = 7/26<br>\nP(Mafia) = 3/13<br>\nP(softed PR | Mafia) = 0.5<br>\n<br>\nThus, P(Mafia | Softed PR) = (3/36)/(/7/26) = 3/7 = approx. 43% (with the remaining 57% going to the odds of being a genuine PR)</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\nAll the working (including the assumptions I made to get there) is in the spoiler, but, long version short; before considering any other scumminess in his post, looking only at the fact that of the PR claim, and not even considering its timing; his odds of being Mafia went up from 23% to 43% - mainly because he cut out the chances of being a vanilla Townie (I'm assuming Townies wouldn't lie about that). At the same time, however, his odds of being a genuine PR went up - from about 15% to around 57%.<br>\n<br>\nNow, on the basis of the 57% chance of being a genuine PR, I had originally decided I shouldn't vote him - despite him still being my top scumread. Mainly because losing a PR would be a disaster, while losing a Vanilla Townie - well, it wouldn't exactly be <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">great</div>, but it would be a good deal less bad. However, MuttonChopMagic bought up a good point - that, by refusing to vote for someone merely because he softed a PR, I would be setting a bad precedent for the future.<br>\n<br>\nI considered his point. What harm could my vote do? It could be a part of a lynch on NotTheRealPaul. But we were a long way from there. To even reach L-1, at least two other Townies would need to vote with me - and an actual lynch would require the aid of at least one more Townie on top of that.<br>\n<br>\nIt could put enough pressure on him to force him to claim. Forcing a PR to claim is a bad thing, because the Mafia then know who to target at night. But... he'd already softed his PR. Mafia already know who he is. Him suddenly jumping up and saying \"I'm the Cop\" or \"I'm the Doctor\" or whatever isn't going to make things a one bit worse - Mafia don't currently know <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">what</div> role he is, but they do know <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">who</div> softed a PR, and - well, that's pretty bad, but that's also <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">done</div>.

He's been pretty near silent. Then he put on two votes, claimed a gut scumread on Cheet and gave no explanation of the Gamma vote, and said Nero was town. That's a pretty pathetically minimal contribution to the state of the game, especially since having caught up, I suspect that the reason behind the Gamma vote was self-preservation (which is NAI because all roles benefit from self-preservation).<br>\n<br>\nGamma actually looks like scum for a variety of reasons, which I have gone over before.<br>\n<br>\nSo, I suspect that Not_Mafia is scum's mislynch for today. It's an easy wagon to push, since it's a policy lynch for a genuinely super-quiet player. It's also a wagon that does not reflect badly on scum-on-the-wagon if the slot flips Town. Therefore, I think that the only reason Not_Mafia's wagon has progressed so far, is that there is scum on it; if Not_Mafia is lynched today and flips Town, then I would recommend taking a very close look at everyone on that wagon tomorrow.<br>\n<br>\nCurrently, my vote is staying on Gamma/kraska77.</div></blockquote>There's a lot that feels off with this post.<br>\nEspecially the \"tomorrow I will pick at the wagon\".

He's been pretty near silent. Then he put on two votes, claimed a gut scumread on Cheet and gave no explanation of the Gamma vote, and said Nero was town. That's a pretty pathetically minimal contribution to the state of the game, especially since having caught up, I suspect that the reason behind the Gamma vote was self-preservation (which is NAI because all roles benefit from self-preservation).<br>\n<br>\nGamma actually looks like scum for a variety of reasons, which I have gone over before.<br>\n<br>\nSo, I suspect that Not_Mafia is scum's mislynch for today. It's an easy wagon to push, since it's a policy lynch for a genuinely super-quiet player. It's also a wagon that does not reflect badly on scum-on-the-wagon if the slot flips Town. Therefore, I think that the only reason Not_Mafia's wagon has progressed so far, is that there is scum on it; if Not_Mafia is lynched today and flips Town, then I would recommend taking a very close look at everyone on that wagon tomorrow.<br>\n<br>\nCurrently, my vote is staying on Gamma/kraska77.</div></blockquote>There's a lot that feels off with this post.<br>\nEspecially the \"tomorrow I will pick at the wagon\". Seems a lot more like setup for tomorrow than a genuine interest in parsing the wagon itself, especially since there's nothing specific being unpacked here.<br>\nAlso don't like the declaration of N_M being a policy lynch. The confidence there feels a little like it's coming from a place of too much information.<br>\n\n</div></blockquote>\n\nI also don't like this post.

Something like half this game consists of replaceouts - surely they can't <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">all</div> be scum. Replacing out is null.<br>\n<br>\nGamma looked pretty scummy. Yes, copying my reads is part of it. So is accusing me of rolefishing and then townreading me something like three posts later. Both of these are pretty ancient history by this point.<br>\n<br>\nThere's also a certain amount of cross-reading going on; NTRP's behaviour with his Gamma vote looks more than a little like scum trying to bus early for distance, then step back before the vote comes anywhere close to a lynch, then refuse to step back on and lynch a scumbuddy. This is an even weaker read than the above paragraph, because NTRP's scumread isn't all that strong to begin with, but it's another feather on the scale, so to speak.<br>\n<br>\nBut ancient history is all I've got. Ever since the replaceout, kraska has been looking pretty null. She's called for a lynch on Nero, claiming meta. (I don't actually know what Nero's meta looks like, I don't remember having played with him before). So, the slot hasn't moved any further scumwards in my reads since Gamma left.<br>\n<br>\nIf Gamma hadn't looked so scummy before he left, I would probably be voting for either PenguinPower or DeathRowKitty by now. (NTRP is my second-top scumread, but I'm reluctant to risk a PR claim on a weakish read).<br>\n<br>\n--------------<br>\n<br>\nSo. There are a few other considerations here. For example, a strong factor for future scumreads is to consider the Not_Mafia wagon versus the Gamma wagon. If, as I suspect, it turns out that Gamma is scum, then that's fairly compelling evidence that the people who were on the Not_Mafia wagon at the time are more likely to be scum than the people who were on the Kraska wagon. Therefore, confirming this particular slot as scum now, on the first night, puts us in a very good position for scumhunting on future nights.", "time": "Fri Jun 16, 2017 7:11 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=72052&start=1300", "forum": "53", "thread": "72052"}

There are several ways to create a nodeath - including a scum team deliberately faking one - but the most likely seems to be either a doctor or a Town roleblocker.<br>\n<br>\nIf there was a Town roleblocker, then we've got someone who's got a pretty good idea who one of the scum is. If so, then that person should probably keep roleblocking the same target until that target is lynched, to prevent further kills. But a doctor seems more likely.<br>\n<br>\nMoreover, the doctor must have chosen to protect the same person as the Mafia chose to kill - if that's the reason for the no-lynch. Now, it seems to me that the obvious person for the doctor to protect is NTRP - since he's made it reasonably clear that he's either Mafia or a PR, and the doctor wants to protect PRs. And clearly, since no-one died, that means it seems likely that either the Mafia is pulling a fast one with a deliberate no kill, or they tried to kill NTRP; the second of these options thus implies that NTRP is Town.<br>\n<br>\nThere's a lot of maybes in that chain of logic, so it's nowhere near ironclad.

Now, since PenguinPower was Town, it's almost certain that there were some Mafia on her wagon. (Note, also, that none of these three names were on the kraska wagon that formed afterwards).<br>\n<br>\nLet's consider two possibilities. First, consider Not_Mafia being scum:<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF0000\">Not_Mafia</div> (6): <div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF0000\">Not_Mafia</div>, Backhand, Cheetory6, DeathRowKitty, <div style=\"display:inline;color:#40BF00\">NotTheRealPaul</div>, <div style=\"display:inline;color:#00FF00\">PenguinPower</div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF00\">Gamma Emerald</div> (2): <div style=\"display:inline;color:#00FF00\">CCC</div>, <div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF00\">MuttonChopMagic</div><br>\nBackhand (1): Grendel<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#00FF00\">CCC</div> (1): Hiraki<br>\nCheetory6 (1): SlingshotWaffles<br>\n<br>\nNot Voting (2): Gamma Emerald, Nero Cain<br>\n<br>\n--------------<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#00FF00\">PenguinPower</div> (7): Cheetory6, Backhand, Nero Cain, DeathRowKitty, <div style=\"display:inline;color:#00FF00\">CCC</div>, <div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF0000\">Not_Mafia</div>, <div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF00\">kraska77</div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF00\">kraska77</div> (5): SlingshotWaffles, <div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF00\">MuttonChopMagic</div>, <div style=\"display:inline;color:#00FF00\">PenguinPower</div>, Hiraki, <div style=\"display:inline;color:#40BF00\">NotTheRealPaul</div><br>\nBackhand (1): Grendel<br>\n<br>\nNot Voting (0):<br>\n<br>\nIn this case, it's clear to see what happened; the votes on Not_Mafia were all Town. Not_Mafia and Nero Cain were the two Mafia votes on PenguinPower. We take those two out, and then we've only got one Mafioso left to find.<br>\n<br>\nBut there's the other option, the option in which Not_Mafia is Town. In that case, we have:<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#00FF00\">Not_Mafia</div> (6): <div style=\"display:inline;color:#00FF00\">Not_Mafia</div>, Backhand, Cheetory6, DeathRowKitty, <div style=\"display:inline;color:#40BF00\">NotTheRealPaul</div>, <div style=\"display:inline;color:#00FF00\">PenguinPower</div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF00\">Gamma Emerald</div> (2): <div style=\"display:inline;color:#00FF00\">CCC</div>, <div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF00\">MuttonChopMagic</div><br>\nBackhand (1): Grendel<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#00FF00\">CCC</div> (1): Hiraki<br>\nCheetory6 (1): SlingshotWaffles<br>\n<br>\nNot Voting (2): Gamma Emerald, Nero Cain<br>\n<br>\n--------------<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#00FF00\">PenguinPower</div> (7): Cheetory6, Backhand, Nero Cain, DeathRowKitty, <div style=\"display:inline;color:#00FF00\">CCC</div>, <div style=\"display:inline;color:#00FF00\">Not_Mafia</div>, <div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF00\">kraska77</div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF00\">kraska77</div> (5): SlingshotWaffles, <div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF00\">MuttonChopMagic</div>, <div style=\"display:inline;color:#00FF00\">PenguinPower</div>, Hiraki, <div style=\"display:inline;color:#40BF00\">NotTheRealPaul</div><br>\nBackhand (1): Grendel<br>\n<br>\nNot Voting (0):<br>\n<br>\nIn this scenario, Not_Mafia was an attempt at pushing through a mislynch on a mostly-absent player.

Said basically nothing of consequence until he hit L-1, and even then said the very minimum. Was close on policy lynched, until a second wagon was started on the slot that Kraska replaced into. Eventually, the lynch was down to between PenguinPower and Kraska; PenguinPower died (flipping Town) and Kraska narrowly (very narrowly) lived.<br>\n<br>\nAlso, during Day One, NotTheRealPaul got a vote or two and immediately (and unnecessarily) softed a PR pretty noticeably.<br>\n<br>\nNight one, there was no kill. (My theory is that the Doctor and the Mafia both hit NTRP for his PR softing)<br>\n<br>\nEarly in Day Two, MuttonChopMagic and Kraska revealed that Kraska had got a PM overnight stating that MuttonChopMagic was innocent. MuttonChopMagic revealed that he was a Friendly Neighbour with a 1xLoyal modifier - the fact that Kraska had received his message meant Kraska must be Townsided as well. Which means that the two of them are either both Town or both Mafia and pulling off a massive bluff. (But both Town seems more likely to me - MCM can prove that by Friendly-Neighbouring more people in future nights).<br>\n<br>\n--------------<br>\n<br>\nSo much for the highlights. Now, on to more speculative matters. Looking at the wagon on Not_Mafia (which is your slot - it's been through several players) yesterday, and comparing it to the votes on the proven-Townie PenguinPower lynch wagon, I notice that (if one ignores the likely-town MCM, Kraska and NTRP) three names are on both wagons - Backhand, Cheetory6, DeathRowKitty. Considering that the day one wagon on your slot was basically an easy policy lynch, the only way I can imagine that there wasn't a heavy scum presence on your wagon was if you yourself are scum. So, if you're Town, then at least one or two of those three pretty much have to be scum - while, on the flip side, if you're scum then I would assume that those three are all likely to be Town (in which case Nero Cain is very likely one of your scumbuddies).<br>\n<br>\nI think you have a pretty decent chance of being scum, and the information we get from verification of your slot is massively valuable.", "time": "Sat Jun 24, 2017 8:57 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=72052&start=1675", "forum": "53", "thread": "72052"}

Looking at the wagon on Not_Mafia (which is your slot - it's been through several players) yesterday, and comparing it to the votes on the proven-Townie PenguinPower lynch wagon, I notice that (if one ignores the likely-town MCM, Kraska and NTRP) three names are on both wagons - Backhand, Cheetory6, DeathRowKitty. Considering that the day one wagon on your slot was basically an easy policy lynch, the only way I can imagine that there wasn't a heavy scum presence on your wagon was if you yourself are scum. So, if you're Town, then at least one or two of those three pretty much have to be scum - while, on the flip side, if you're scum then I would assume that those three are all likely to be Town (in which case Nero Cain is very likely one of your scumbuddies).<br>\n<br>\nI think you have a pretty decent chance of being scum, and the information we get from verification of your slot is massively valuable.</div></blockquote>\n\nSo, for a start, I don't care about your read on me, so it's a waste of an opinion towards me.<br>\n<br>\nHowever, explain to me how you come to the idea that either scum was on my wagon, or all town was and I'm scum? <br>\nBackhand, Cheetory6, DeathRowKitty - What do you think of these 3 players from how they played so far?", "time": "Sun Jun 25, 2017 9:55 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=72052&start=1775", "forum": "53", "thread": "72052"}

This makes him a very easy policy lynch; there were arguments being made that this is <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">not</div> a player one wants around in MYLO or LYLO, and someone (Backhand, I think?) went so far as to gather data to suggest that day-one lynches are generally not much better than random chance <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">anyway</div>.<br>\n<br>\nAnd, let me reiterate, he hit L-1.<br>\n<br>\nSo. Two options. Either you are scum or you are not.<br>\n<br>\nLet us consider first the case where you are scum. In this case, the Mafia must have been in a panic. One of their own, up for the lynch - and so early, for such terrible reasons? They would have grabbed the next-most-popular wagon and pushed it, <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">hard</div>. (As Backhand points out, there were a rapid pair of votes added to the next-most-popular wagon around then).<br>\n<br>\nAlternatively, it is still possible that you may have been Town. If you were Town, then either the wagon on your slot already had scum on it, or it was pure Town. But - if you were Town, and the wagon on you was pure Town, then <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">why</div> would Mafia not have hammered you? Your slot's lynch was a policy lynch, no-one was suggesting that the slot had any more chance than anyone else of being scum - what better lynch to be able to walk away from after  townflip and just shrug?<br>\n<br>\nSo, yeah. Either you're scum, or there's scum on your wagon.<br>\n<br>\n--------------<br>\n<br>\nWhich brings us to the next point. Backhand, Cheetory, DeathRowKitty. The first two I've been Townreading; DRK I had been reading as scum but that's changed somewhat after Gigabyte replaced in. All three reads were fairly light, and tone-based, and therefore could well be wrong; before Gigabyte's replace-in, had you flipped Town, I would have wanted to vote DRK next. Now, I'm... less certain which way to pick between them.<br>\n<br>\nNonetheless. If that happens, I'll deal with it when it does. Right now, I'm thinking you're more likely to flip scum than most other players at any rate.", "time": "Mon Jun 26, 2017 6:01 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=72052&start=1775", "forum": "53", "thread": "72052"}

This game most of my town reads today and yesterday have been not very collaborative with me. Ex: Cheeorty doesn&#8217;t care, Mutton has a speech impediment, Sling is abrasive, Kaseka has been scum reading me, Not Puel is never around. I wasn&#8217;t able to motivate myself without support of &#8220;x&#8221; player(s) So I never got a good footing in this game.<br>\n<br>\nI gernally prescribe to an idea that there are different positions that town needs at different times, and when those positions go unfilled that game state suffers. When motivated my game revolves around filling the holes in town&#8217;s communication. So today I was hoping to simultaneously be towns heart and leader. I guess I&#8217;m too late and therefore neither. <br>\n<br>\nI am my strongest when I feel like I&#8217;m the player that is putting forth the most effort to slove the game meanwhile bieng underestimated before doing so. Perhaps I counted on it happening this game- when I found the time to do it- and didn&#8217;t consider the likihood that somebody way more caplable of an archetypical leadership role would come in before I had the chance to prove myself. <br>\n<br>\nI had started setting some strategic thought down on a word doc Friday night to form a sort of plan. If I couldn&#8217;t get on the same page with anybody, then I figured that I&#8217;d have to force myself to get it together once I had a solid few hours to sit down and read the game. So starting today I was going to attempt to play OB!town supper hard, and get all my town reads into a town bloc. I even drafted out a series of things I wanted to go through, just to make sure I kept all my thoughts together!", "time": "Mon Jun 26, 2017 7:55 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=72052&start=1800", "forum": "53", "thread": "72052"}

In the end the three players that are mentioned most consistently are the ones (the only ones) that are on the table to be lynched today.<br>\nI recognize that this probably would have been better D1, but with the slow state of the game, and the lack of cohesion of the players in it I think we should employ this now. <br>\nHere are mine (Nero, Backhand, DRK)\"<br>\n<br>\nPostivety and good questions is prob what I need to do at this point.<br>\n---<br>\nFoucus on Cheetory because he is strong experienced player, and probably easyier to commune woth then Mutton/Kaska/Sling/NoPaul.<br>\n\"@cheetory <br>\nI know that you aren&#8217;t feeling very involved atm but I really need your insight on this game. I&#8217;m in an award position where I&#8217;m confidant all my town reads are town, but I don&#8217;t know where scum is hiding in all my nullish/scumish reads.

I guess the best thing I can do is gets as much Not!Grendel content from her as I can before she dies. Hopefully she lurk for a little whilie longer so I can start sorting myself out.<br>\n---<br>\nSling is a trying player. But we are town reading eachother. I&#8217;ll try to keep him from getting policy lynched. What would be great is if I could get him really focusing on interacting with just me. I think the main issue is that he is throwing snark in everybodies face.

I just feel in general that you&#8217;ve been kinnda off your town game. I get that you&#8217;re fixated that Nero meta lynch is bad, but I&#8217;d apperiate a defense for why you think he is town/ a bad lynch aside from that.<br>\nI&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;m sold on CCC, but I do think that his recent fixations haven&#8217;t been great along with scum reading me for even worse reasons. Can you quote any case stuff you had against him for my conveince?<br>\nI feel like of my current scum spects you are probably the one I&#8217;m Wroung on.\"<br>\n--- <br>\n I don&#8217;t really know anything about Pual, or what kind of stimulas would draw him out. Its annoying when prob town lurks out a game.  <br>\n<br>\nI wonder if I hard ate at any of the town reads that neglect to answer my questions it&#8217;d make me more town looking ingerneral. I think it just makes me look really town like from scum pov. Which wouldn&#8217;t be bad b/c getting night killed would mean that I wouldn&#8217;t have to keep playing leader. It also gets anybody harboring scum/null reads onto something more meangful.     <br>\n<br>\nHopefully Nero actually is town. If so then I won&#8217;t get lynched for assoiatives. I don&#8217;r see a game where Scum!Nero won&#8217;t incriminate me with his flip. Regardless of his alignment is I don&#8217;t see a postion where I&#8217;d want to keep him around this game. <br>\n<br>\nTown!Nero makes sense with Scum Hiraki actually :/ <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n&#8220;town bloc&#8221;<br>\nI need to get Cheetory, Mutton, Kaska, Not Pual, and sling together and on good collaborative wave length. Lord save me. <br>\nFourtently Mutton and Kaska are conftown, but I may need to provide a case on why Sling is town. Everybody seems to be ignoring Not Paul, so idk if he is mutual town read. I think everybody is okay with Cheetory town.<br>\nAlmost most wonder if I could just come right out and propose town bloc. Biggest issue is keeping it together I think.

I never said I TR'd Nero - I said it was a terrible wagon and lynch compared to Waffles and CCC.</div></blockquote>\n\nI can provide a non-meta based reason to vote Nero as scum.<br>\n<br>\nTake a look at the day one wagon on Not_Mafia. Aside from N_M's self-vote and a bunch of people who now have strong reasons to be considered Town, the votes on that wagon are Backhand, Cheetory, DeathRowKitty.<br>\n<br>\nNow, take a look at the votes on the PenguinPower lynch at the end of the day. Backhand, Cheetory, DeathRowKitty are also on that wagon, along with a lot of very-probably-Townies and Nero Cain.<br>\n<br>\nNow. Either Not_Mafia is Town or Not_Mafia is Mafia.<br>\n<br>\nIf Not_Mafia is Mafia: The people on his wagon are more probably Town than Scum. This causes Townleans for Backhand, Cheetory, DRK. There probably is scum on Penguin's wagon; this means that N_M being scum translates into a very strong probability of Nero being scum.<br>\n<br>\nIf Not_Mafia is Town: Almost certainly, one (perhaps two) of the people on N_M's wagon are scum. (That's between Backhand, Cheet, and DRK). Nero is still quite possibly scum; though the odds of Town Nero are a good deal higher in this probability branch.<br>\n<br>\nSummed over both branches, Nero's probability of being scum ends up being higher than Not_Mafia's. (Though we get better information from the Not_Mafia slot).", "time": "Tue Jun 27, 2017 6:32 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=72052&start=1875", "forum": "53", "thread": "72052"}

I'll wait to hear from Vedith before actually voting (I don't particularly like his \"no talking unless I have no votes\" ultimatum, since a single scum could use it to silence him completely, but let's hear what he has to say).<br>\n<br>\nMy current thoughts; if Vedith is scum, then his final partner is either Grendel or Hiraki. If Vedith is Town, then Backhand and DeathRowKitty's voting patterns begin to look extremely suspicious. So I'm perfectly happy to lynch Vedith today and work from there.

Backhand/Hiraki does make some sense as a scumteam. (I'd still like an explanation of how you figured it out, Vedith, so that I can test the strength of your reasoning).<br>\n<br>\nThe thing is, though, that Vedith/Grendel <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">also</div> makes sense as a scumteam.

In a game I recently modded they reflexively wanted to bus Ginngie for a scummy lol hammer, and felt like nancy discarding the proposed play was incorrect. So Giga&#8217;s perception of their buddies scuminess is much stronger from Giga&#8217;s POV then towns, and thus the urge to bus is higher than the average player. <br>\n<br>\n4)\tGiga themselves remarked that Nero has poor scum play. The cost of attempting to keep him around would not have been worth the effort needed to do so. <br>\n<br>\nThis off course doesn&#8217;t establish that Giga is scum, but it does establish that Giga would lynch Nero yesterday regardless their alignment.

If Vedith is Town, then his reads have strong merit - not that Hiraki's impassioned defense of Nero has done him any favours, either.<br>\n<br>\n(Mind you, some other pair - like Vedith/Backhand - is also not without merit.

It registers as an excuse to lynch people off the wagon.<br>\n<br>\nWhich, is classic trade mark of bussing scum maximizing on newly nested opportunities.

Just keep protecting MCM, and Town is basically guaranteed a win.<br>\n<br>\nNow, assuming that all PR role reveals have been truthful; scum has a good chance of being Backhand/Grendel. The setup as it stands does look rather Townsided to me (having a Cop-equivalent in MCM and a Doctor-equivalent in the Rolestopper). I know that in newbie games, last I looked at that grid, the only way to end up with both Cop and Doc involved the Scum getting a Roleblocker. A Scum Roleblocker is, I think, still very much a possibility (if so, I expect he tried to roleblock MCM on Night 2 but was thwarted by the Rolestopper)<br>\n<br>\nThe other option for a Scum Power Role, of course, is our Motion Detector (and his backup). Scum could certainly do with a way to look for and identify the Rolestopper, and a Motion Detector seems like a good way to give the Scumteam this capability; an NTRP/Hiraki scumteam is very much on the cards.<br>\n<br>\nA third option is that Vedith is lying; that we actually have a Doctor instead of a Rolestopper and Vedith is relying on the Doctor not speaking up to get away with his lie. (If anyone dies and flips Doctor, then Vedith needs to get lynched the very next day). (That we don't have a protective role at all seems unlikely - scum could have faked the Night One kill, but why not hit MCM on Night Two unless they were trying to dodge a Protective role?)<br>\n<br>\nBetween those two options, I have to say, I think Backhand/Grendel is the more likely scumteam.

It felt like he was looking at a check box for acceptable activity, and we made the grade.  Like little introspective about motivations outside of... maybe Kraska. Backhand was a very strong gut town read on Kraska from their entrance onward. <br>\n <br>\nI think that the only low content poster he town read was Not Puel, and that was over a town slip, and pr soft. <br>\n<br>\nOverall it&#8217;s a very black/white approach to the game for a player that doesn&#8217;t seem to be a normally hard line player. I say this because Backhand keeps a pretty chill rhetoric even when annoyed this game. (I think that clashes a bit with his first game here where he was frustrated to the point of cursing and dramatics) Like I guess I could see him being a &#8220;it is my way or nobodies&#8221; if he had the same level of frustration at getting called out here that he did elsewhere, but I don&#8217;t see that. Low content always equals scummy, high content is always town is a really simplistic way to view it. Like even taking into consideration that it was D1 it felt shoehorned in there. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\nCould also see Backhand keeping Nero as back pocket read, He had a stated candor to lynch Nero that never seems to come ful circle D1.

This thread escalated quickly.  <br>\n<br>\nMCM, why make a big post on CCC and not change your vote?</div></blockquote>\n\nI actually had a scum read on Backhand before he ever posted in the game because I distinctly remember him being online the day that the game was lunched for at least four hours (that was the same amount of time I was online that night). He never showed up to the thread proper to post anything, and was not posting anywhere else on site. I even checked later. The 3rd of June was when this game started, Backhand has no posts in the other two games that were having game over discussion on the 3rd, but does have posts on the 2nd, and 4th. Backhands first post in this game was the 4th. Ei, Backhand was probably hiding out in the scum PT the day the game started.<br>\n<br>\nThis was the ethically gray thing I wasn't gonna mention. I decided I might as well if it lynches scum tomarrow.</div></blockquote>\n\nUgh, this sucks as a reason to get lynched for either alignment!  Other interpretation, I was busy on a Saturday.  <br>\n<br>\nOn 1905 to 1915, 1905 was my first forum game in a long time and I was less inclined to take strong positions like *players who are known to be fucking useless and skate on it* is unacceptable.  I felt at the time that people were trying to get easy towncred by defending not Mafia, so I took a stronger position than I totally believe in, to see what happened.</div></blockquote>\n\nThat&#8217;s why I wasn&#8217;t going to bring it up. You could have been on, but afk, or browsing other web pages, or whatever. But it can&#8217;t be validated, alI I know is that you were on and never said anything. Just a simple &#8220;Hi&#8221; in the thread proper would have worked.<br>\n---<br>\nExcept a lot of your pushes looked less like specifically scum reading players, and more like, &#8220;This player is playing badly guys lets lynch him.&#8221; Like what were you expecting them to flip scum or were your fear voting b/c you saw scum get away with it before? Why?   <br>\n<br>\nYou had a reason to justify your actions based of a previous game.

Either he really is a town PR, or Scum used their first-48-hour scumtalk to carefully prepare fake claims. So, presumably, his investigative results were planned out in advance as well.<br>\n<br>\nNow, Motion Detector is a weak role, but it's normally fairly easy to counterclaim. If he gives results, and claims no movement, then literally <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">any</div> Town PR could counterclaim with the reason of \"but I visited him\". Here, we have a pair of results that appear to be carefully planned to make a counterclaim impossible - \"forgot to submit an action\" is completely non-counterclaimable, and \"saw the confirmed PR who requested doctor protection move\" is, similarly, impossible to counterclaim.<br>\n<br>\nBut, in this case, there actually <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">is</div> a possible counterclaim. See, last night (the last time Scum talked) we didn't know yet about the Rolestopper. Most people seemed to think there might be a Doctor - I know I did. And the Doctor does not stop motion detectors. But the Rolestopper <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">does</div>.<br>\n<br>\nMCM claimed a blown one-shot Loyal modifier. But he also (very strongly) requested Doctor support the following night. It looked obvious to me that his one-shot Loyal wasn't one-shot after all, and I can only assume that the Rolestopper saw the same - MCM's request was very strongly put. So, the Rolestopper would pretty much have to be on MCM. (This would also explain the apparent preponderance of Town power this game - I still think Scum has a roleblocker, who clashed with the rolestopper on MCM Night Two). With the Rolestopper on MCM, NTRP should not have gotten that motion result. (I'm thinking he stuck with the fakeclaim that had been planned in the Mafia chat the previous night, presumably by a more experienced player).<br>\n<br>\nHence, NTRP's motion detector results look completely fake.<br>\n<br>\nThat's the current centre of my NTRP case.", "time": "Sat Jul 08, 2017 11:57 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=72052&start=2350", "forum": "53", "thread": "72052"}

The 3rd of June was when this game started, Backhand has no posts in the other two games that were having game over discussion on the 3rd, but does have posts on the 2nd, and 4th. Backhands first post in this game was the 4th. Ei, Backhand was probably hiding out in the scum PT the day the game started.<br>\n<br>\nThis was the ethically gray thing I wasn't gonna mention.

Either he really is a town PR, or Scum used their first-48-hour scumtalk to carefully prepare fake claims. So, presumably, his investigative results were planned out in advance as well.<br>\n<br>\nNow, Motion Detector is a weak role, but it's normally fairly easy to counterclaim. If he gives results, and claims no movement, then literally <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">any</div> Town PR could counterclaim with the reason of \"but I visited him\". Here, we have a pair of results that appear to be carefully planned to make a counterclaim impossible - \"forgot to submit an action\" is completely non-counterclaimable, and \"saw the confirmed PR who requested doctor protection move\" is, similarly, impossible to counterclaim.<br>\n<br>\nBut, in this case, there actually <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">is</div> a possible counterclaim. See, last night (the last time Scum talked) we didn't know yet about the Rolestopper. Most people seemed to think there might be a Doctor - I know I did. And the Doctor does not stop motion detectors. But the Rolestopper <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">does</div>.<br>\n<br>\nMCM claimed a blown one-shot Loyal modifier. But he also (very strongly) requested Doctor support the following night. It looked obvious to me that his one-shot Loyal wasn't one-shot after all, and I can only assume that the Rolestopper saw the same - MCM's request was very strongly put. So, the Rolestopper would pretty much have to be on MCM. (This would also explain the apparent preponderance of Town power this game - I still think Scum has a roleblocker, who clashed with the rolestopper on MCM Night Two). With the Rolestopper on MCM, NTRP should not have gotten that motion result. (I'm thinking he stuck with the fakeclaim that had been planned in the Mafia chat the previous night, presumably by a more experienced player).<br>\n<br>\nHence, NTRP's motion detector results look completely fake.<br>\n<br>\nThat's the current centre of my NTRP case.</div></blockquote>\n\nIf this were to be the case, then the rolestopper really does need to claim.  That would be a guilty result and possibly another innocent result from N1.  <br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=9402353#p9402353\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=9402353#p9402353\" data-post-id=\"9402353\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 2399</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=24704\">Cheetory6</a> wrote:</cite><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">@Implosion</div>: Can scum have a backup of a town role?</div></blockquote>\n\nBy the normal game guidelines, yes.<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=9402454#p9402454\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=9402454#p9402454\" data-post-id=\"9402454\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 2416</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=26091\">Vedith</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=9402442#p9402442\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=9402442#p9402442\" data-post-id=\"9402442\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 2414</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=29966\">MuttonChopMagic</a> wrote:</cite>answer my questions. play the game like you aren't the best player to ever touch it. of course you are, but humor me.<br>\nand yes, there's a precise time I become God. page 6 of day 5 I will solve the game. that's how mafia works. see?</div></blockquote>\n\nI don't decide that I'm the best player in Mafia, that's my reads that decide that.<br>\nAgain, they are my reads and Implosion told me nothing.<br>\nI doubt your ability to get anything right.</div></blockquote>\n\nYeah but you still have me as scum so, those reads aren't all that good.", "time": "Sun Jul 09, 2017 7:03 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=72052&start=2425", "forum": "53", "thread": "72052"}
