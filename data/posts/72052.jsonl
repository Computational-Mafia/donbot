What are you feeling as you enter this mini's D1?</div></blockquote><br><br>1. Ima be honest. I'm not sure. Either one feels like a role when you consider the fact that Town go after Town more than they do mafia. Even as Town, I still need to get people to believe I'm Town and keep mafia from wanting to night kill me. In some ways, I think playing as mafia is easier for people that are good at playing people against each other and can be consistent at the same time. Either way, we're all playing roles.<br><br>2. ...depends on a lot of things. Some people will get ideas about other players and go after them the whole game, only to find out they were town. I don't collaborate with those people. I also prefer to keep my cards close to my chest and vote when I see weird interactions happening. I think other Townies won't like this because it means I'm going to vote more on intuition and not going with the wagon if I feel reservations about the lynch.<br><br>3. I don't think it really matters much. Anybody can play any way they like and it doesn't mean someone is mafia just because they don't fit a certain personality or role that is typical for a Townie. How people behave and read one another can start to show some patterns, especially when other players make reads with weird or somewhat random logic and buddy up in ways that don't follow the progression of the game very well.<br><br>4. None. I haven't played this in a long time. Wanted to try again; had a bad experience before with people getting mad at each other and stuff. Just want to play without too much of that. We'll see what happens I guess.<br><br>5. Excitement. Roleplaying and mystery is fun."}

Is this correct?<br><br>Now, if the contentions in the previous two paragraph thingies are correct (i.e. that you found answering the questions to be a positive and that you found asking for reads to be anti-town), it would seem reasonable to conclude that you find more value in non-game-specific questions than you do in discussing reads.

Either one of them could you know, alleviate my concern instead of dodging it and implying that I'm dumb. But then they would actually have to participate.<br><br>Though admittedly, DRKs read of Gamma is pretty legit. Gamma is certainly playing in a way that keeps his options open and I find that a bit scummy. But I'm also inclined to think DRK is trying to start a wagon to direct away from my read on them, as shit and/or personal as people might think it to be."}

Is this correct?<br><br>Now, if the contentions in the previous two paragraph thingies are correct (i.e. that you found answering the questions to be a positive and that you found asking for reads to be anti-town), it would seem reasonable to conclude that you find more value in non-game-specific questions than you do in discussing reads.

I hate it when players justify a read by implying that \"If there not scum then they're bad town\". Its like distancing oneself from the cadaver.<br><br>The thing is that I see this behavior from inexperienced players trying to convince themselves and others that they are right. I used to believe that the behavior was scummy, but I never got enough evidence the indicates its a legit tell. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\"> <br><br>Any case its a read that Notsure is clearly emotionally invested in.

Though yeah, I'm a little annoyed at DRK, but it's more because she is being hypocritical and dodgy, as well as Paul.<br><br>As I said to Paul<br>\"If you know it takes time to judge a player's beginning behavior and DRK is doing the opposite, why is that not setting off any alarms, but my picking up on it somehow does? This makes zero sense.\"<br><br>His answer is \"I don't scumread him\". So he's not even addressing my concern. And taking the same scummy stance as DRK in doing so. Either one of them could you know, alleviate my concern instead of dodging it and implying that I'm dumb. But then they would actually have to participate.<br><br>Though admittedly, DRKs read of Gamma is pretty legit. Gamma is certainly playing in a way that keeps his options open and I find that a bit scummy.

Although recently his posting has pinged town to me so he isnt quite scum but he isnt dead null.<br><br>GE is here mostly because of his readlist. So while he was catching up b4 his readlist, he called CCC out (kinda) saying he thought he was rolefishing, but lo and behold he is one of his top town reads when the list is out. Now I dont believe he really mentions backhand at all and yet backhand is still a tr for him. IDK like I think im reaching but its something I noticed. His push on cheetory pinged me really hard, but the rest of his play is okay. <br><br>So that should be everybody. My SRs arent very strong so IDK who'd I'd vote rn. It'd be between MCM and Notsure. I do want to go back and look at DRK's case on GE as it confuses me, but Im too tired atm. If someone could explain it concisely and simply (so MCM prob not u) that would be nice.<br><br>Looking back I realized all my SRs are people who are voting me so it does look pretty ONGUSy. But ehh, my reads are what they are.<br><br>And ifs prob time I sleep as its 4:30 AM here"}

DRK was pushing me as scum with weak reasons and I didn't like that, reasons you stated above doesn't mean shit until D2/D3.

It's bizarre.<br><br><br><br><br><br>...and you know I find this all kind of funny since I mentioned in the questionnaire <br><br>\"4. None. I haven't played this in a long time. Wanted to try again; had a bad experience before with people getting mad at each other and stuff. Just want to play without too much of that. We'll see what happens I guess.\"<br><br> Could be nothing, but I've gotten the impression that has been used against me from the start. Could be projection or something. But for a player that says it takes time to judge someone's beginning behavior, but then goes on to judge me for being defensive, there's just a huge contradiction with that, along with all the other things said about you. And the really funny thing, is that if anything, that just makes my behavior consistent, which you also fail to take into account."}

What I want to know, therefore, is the probability (before factoring in any scumminess in his posts) that he is Mafia, *given* that he softed a Town PR. Using Bayes' Theroem:<br><br>P(Mafia | Softed PR) = P(softed PR | Mafia)*P(Mafia)/P(Softed PR)<br><br>P(Softed PR) = 2/13+(0.5*3/13) = 7/26<br>P(Mafia) = 3/13<br>P(softed PR | Mafia) = 0.5<br><br>Thus, P(Mafia | Softed PR) = (3/36)/(/7/26) = 3/7 = approx. 43% (with the remaining 57% going to the odds of being a genuine PR)</span><br><br>All the working (including the assumptions I made to get there) is in the spoiler, but, long version short; before considering any other scumminess in his post, looking only at the fact that of the PR claim, and not even considering its timing; his odds of being Mafia went up from 23% to 43% - mainly because he cut out the chances of being a vanilla Townie (I'm assuming Townies wouldn't lie about that). At the same time, however, his odds of being a genuine PR went up - from about 15% to around 57%.<br><br>Now, on the basis of the 57% chance of being a genuine PR, I had originally decided I shouldn't vote him - despite him still being my top scumread. Mainly because losing a PR would be a disaster, while losing a Vanilla Townie - well, it wouldn't exactly be <span style=\"font-style: italic\">great</span>, but it would be a good deal less bad. However, MuttonChopMagic bought up a good point - that, by refusing to vote for someone merely because he softed a PR, I would be setting a bad precedent for the future.<br><br>I considered his point. What harm could my vote do? It could be a part of a lynch on NotTheRealPaul. But we were a long way from there. To even reach L-1, at least two other Townies would need to vote with me - and an actual lynch would require the aid of at least one more Townie on top of that.<br><br>It could put enough pressure on him to force him to claim. Forcing a PR to claim is a bad thing, because the Mafia then know who to target at night. But... he'd already softed his PR. Mafia already know who he is. Him suddenly jumping up and saying \"I'm the Cop\" or \"I'm the Doctor\" or whatever isn't going to make things a one bit worse - Mafia don't currently know <span style=\"font-style: italic\">what</span> role he is, but they do know <span style=\"font-style: italic\">who</span> softed a PR, and - well, that's pretty bad, but that's also <span style=\"font-style: italic\">done</span>. There's no putting the genie back in the bottle now.<br><br>So, in the end, I concluded that there was minimal danger in voting for my top scumread, despite his claim, and promptly did so."}

As far as NotMafia I think he is only the lynch if we have no other hood leads as CCC or Backhand said. <br><br>Now MCM and GE arent really scum reads but theyre not dead null like raya and nm, so I put them a little lower. So I didnt like MCM's opening few posts. Someone said his pbpa seemed like a townie reaction, but I disagree it felt like he was overcompensating. Like he was scum trying to scare some of us out of SRing him lest he tunnel us.

At the same time, however, his odds of being a genuine PR went up - from about 15% to around 57%.<br><br>Now, on the basis of the 57% chance of being a genuine PR, I had originally decided I shouldn't vote him - despite him still being my top scumread. Mainly because losing a PR would be a disaster, while losing a Vanilla Townie - well, it wouldn't exactly be <span style=\"font-style: italic\">great</span>, but it would be a good deal less bad. However, MuttonChopMagic bought up a good point - that, by refusing to vote for someone merely because he softed a PR, I would be setting a bad precedent for the future.<br><br>I considered his point. What harm could my vote do? It could be a part of a lynch on NotTheRealPaul. But we were a long way from there. To even reach L-1, at least two other Townies would need to vote with me - and an actual lynch would require the aid of at least one more Townie on top of that.<br><br>It could put enough pressure on him to force him to claim. Forcing a PR to claim is a bad thing, because the Mafia then know who to target at night. But... he'd already softed his PR. Mafia already know who he is. Him suddenly jumping up and saying \"I'm the Cop\" or \"I'm the Doctor\" or whatever isn't going to make things a one bit worse - Mafia don't currently know <span style=\"font-style: italic\">what</span> role he is, but they do know <span style=\"font-style: italic\">who</span> softed a PR, and - well, that's pretty bad, but that's also <span style=\"font-style: italic\">done</span>.

He's been pretty near silent. Then he put on two votes, claimed a gut scumread on Cheet and gave no explanation of the Gamma vote, and said Nero was town. That's a pretty pathetically minimal contribution to the state of the game, especially since having caught up, I suspect that the reason behind the Gamma vote was self-preservation (which is NAI because all roles benefit from self-preservation).<br><br>Gamma actually looks like scum for a variety of reasons, which I have gone over before.<br><br>So, I suspect that Not_Mafia is scum's mislynch for today. It's an easy wagon to push, since it's a policy lynch for a genuinely super-quiet player. It's also a wagon that does not reflect badly on scum-on-the-wagon if the slot flips Town. Therefore, I think that the only reason Not_Mafia's wagon has progressed so far, is that there is scum on it; if Not_Mafia is lynched today and flips Town, then I would recommend taking a very close look at everyone on that wagon tomorrow.<br><br>Currently, my vote is staying on Gamma/kraska77.</div></blockquote>There's a lot that feels off with this post.<br>Especially the \"tomorrow I will pick at the wagon\". Seems a lot more like setup for tomorrow than a genuine interest in parsing the wagon itself, especially since there's nothing specific being unpacked here.<br>Also don't like the declaration of N_M being a policy lynch. The confidence there feels a little like it's coming from a place of too much information.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>CCC wrote:</cite>Because I'm Town?<br><br>I don't know how Cheetory's recognising that, mind you.</div></blockquote>Also don't really like this post!<br>I'm kind of sucking at putting my feelings to thoughts tonight, but this is probably the only thing I feel anything for right now.

It's an easy wagon to push, since it's a policy lynch for a genuinely super-quiet player. It's also a wagon that does not reflect badly on scum-on-the-wagon if the slot flips Town. Therefore, I think that the only reason Not_Mafia's wagon has progressed so far, is that there is scum on it; if Not_Mafia is lynched today and flips Town, then I would recommend taking a very close look at everyone on that wagon tomorrow.<br><br>Currently, my vote is staying on Gamma/kraska77.</div></blockquote>There's a lot that feels off with this post.<br>Especially the \"tomorrow I will pick at the wagon\".

Something like half this game consists of replaceouts - surely they can't <span style=\"font-style: italic\">all</span> be scum. Replacing out is null.<br><br>Gamma looked pretty scummy. Yes, copying my reads is part of it. So is accusing me of rolefishing and then townreading me something like three posts later. Both of these are pretty ancient history by this point.<br><br>There's also a certain amount of cross-reading going on; NTRP's behaviour with his Gamma vote looks more than a little like scum trying to bus early for distance, then step back before the vote comes anywhere close to a lynch, then refuse to step back on and lynch a scumbuddy. This is an even weaker read than the above paragraph, because NTRP's scumread isn't all that strong to begin with, but it's another feather on the scale, so to speak.<br><br>But ancient history is all I've got. Ever since the replaceout, kraska has been looking pretty null. She's called for a lynch on Nero, claiming meta. (I don't actually know what Nero's meta looks like, I don't remember having played with him before). So, the slot hasn't moved any further scumwards in my reads since Gamma left.<br><br>If Gamma hadn't looked so scummy before he left, I would probably be voting for either PenguinPower or DeathRowKitty by now. (NTRP is my second-top scumread, but I'm reluctant to risk a PR claim on a weakish read).<br><br>--------------<br><br>So. There are a few other considerations here. For example, a strong factor for future scumreads is to consider the Not_Mafia wagon versus the Gamma wagon. If, as I suspect, it turns out that Gamma is scum, then that's fairly compelling evidence that the people who were on the Not_Mafia wagon at the time are more likely to be scum than the people who were on the Kraska wagon. Therefore, confirming this particular slot as scum now, on the first night, puts us in a very good position for scumhunting on future nights."}

There are several ways to create a nodeath - including a scum team deliberately faking one - but the most likely seems to be either a doctor or a Town roleblocker.<br><br>If there was a Town roleblocker, then we've got someone who's got a pretty good idea who one of the scum is. If so, then that person should probably keep roleblocking the same target until that target is lynched, to prevent further kills. But a doctor seems more likely.<br><br>Moreover, the doctor must have chosen to protect the same person as the Mafia chose to kill - if that's the reason for the no-lynch. Now, it seems to me that the obvious person for the doctor to protect is NTRP - since he's made it reasonably clear that he's either Mafia or a PR, and the doctor wants to protect PRs. And clearly, since no-one died, that means it seems likely that either the Mafia is pulling a fast one with a deliberate no kill, or they tried to kill NTRP; the second of these options thus implies that NTRP is Town.<br><br>There's a lot of maybes in that chain of logic, so it's nowhere near ironclad. But it seems sensible to townread NTRP a bit more due to that."}

I panicked because I was still scumreading NTRP and jumped right off the wagon. I dithered a bit between kraska and PP and eventually went with my gut (and my top two townreads) and jumped on the PP wagon, bringing it to L-2 (along with the kraska wagon). Then two more people voted PP in quick succession. (Then I think two people switched to kraska but it was too late, PP had already been hammered)."}

This seems... rather unlikely, and is easily verified - once MCM has visited <span style=\"font-style: italic\">enough</span> people at night, we'll have mod confirmation of innocence sent to more people than there are Mafia, at which point he (and therefore Kaska) will be proven Town.<br><br>For the moment, i.e. until more information is obtained tomorrow, I shall assume them both Town."}

First, consider Not_Mafia being scum:<br><br><span style=\"color: #FF0000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Not_Mafia</span></span> (6): <span style=\"color: #FF0000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Not_Mafia</span></span>, Backhand, Cheetory6, DeathRowKitty, <span style=\"color: #40BF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">NotTheRealPaul</span></span>, <span style=\"color: #00FF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">PenguinPower</span></span><br><span style=\"color: #00BF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Gamma Emerald</span></span> (2): <span style=\"color: #00FF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">CCC</span></span>, <span style=\"color: #00BF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">MuttonChopMagic</span></span><br>Backhand (1): Grendel<br><span style=\"color: #00FF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">CCC</span></span> (1): Hiraki<br>Cheetory6 (1): SlingshotWaffles<br><br>Not Voting (2): Gamma Emerald, Nero Cain<br><br>--------------<br><br><span style=\"color: #00FF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">PenguinPower</span></span> (7): Cheetory6, Backhand, Nero Cain, DeathRowKitty, <span style=\"color: #00FF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">CCC</span></span>, <span style=\"color: #FF0000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Not_Mafia</span></span>, <span style=\"color: #00BF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">kraska77</span></span><br><span style=\"color: #00BF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">kraska77</span></span> (5): SlingshotWaffles, <span style=\"color: #00BF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">MuttonChopMagic</span></span>, <span style=\"color: #00FF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">PenguinPower</span></span>, Hiraki, <span style=\"color: #40BF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">NotTheRealPaul</span></span><br>Backhand (1): Grendel<br><br>Not Voting (0):<br><br>In this case, it's clear to see what happened; the votes on Not_Mafia were all Town. Not_Mafia and Nero Cain were the two Mafia votes on PenguinPower. We take those two out, and then we've only got one Mafioso left to find.<br><br>But there's the other option, the option in which Not_Mafia is Town. In that case, we have:<br><br><span style=\"color: #00FF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Not_Mafia</span></span> (6): <span style=\"color: #00FF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Not_Mafia</span></span>, Backhand, Cheetory6, DeathRowKitty, <span style=\"color: #40BF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">NotTheRealPaul</span></span>, <span style=\"color: #00FF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">PenguinPower</span></span><br><span style=\"color: #00BF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Gamma Emerald</span></span> (2): <span style=\"color: #00FF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">CCC</span></span>, <span style=\"color: #00BF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">MuttonChopMagic</span></span><br>Backhand (1): Grendel<br><span style=\"color: #00FF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">CCC</span></span> (1): Hiraki<br>Cheetory6 (1): SlingshotWaffles<br><br>Not Voting (2): Gamma Emerald, Nero Cain<br><br>--------------<br><br><span style=\"color: #00FF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">PenguinPower</span></span> (7): Cheetory6, Backhand, Nero Cain, DeathRowKitty, <span style=\"color: #00FF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">CCC</span></span>, <span style=\"color: #00FF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Not_Mafia</span></span>, <span style=\"color: #00BF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">kraska77</span></span><br><span style=\"color: #00BF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">kraska77</span></span> (5): SlingshotWaffles, <span style=\"color: #00BF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">MuttonChopMagic</span></span>, <span style=\"color: #00FF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">PenguinPower</span></span>, Hiraki, <span style=\"color: #40BF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">NotTheRealPaul</span></span><br>Backhand (1): Grendel<br><br>Not Voting (0):<br><br>In this scenario, Not_Mafia was an attempt at pushing through a mislynch on a mostly-absent player. There must have been at least one or perhaps even two Mafia in the group {Cheetory6, Backhand, DeathRowKitty}. (Two of whom I'm Townreading, but I have little but tone to base those reads on, so they could well be wrong).<br><br>So. It seems that Not_Mafia would, at the very least, be a most <span style=\"font-style: italic\">informative</span> lynch; proving, for sure, one way or another, whether he's scum or not should allow us to focus our future scumhunting very, very precisely.</div></div></div>"}

Other than that, where am I starting?</div></blockquote><br><br>Day One, the player in your slot was... ridiculously quiet. Said basically nothing of consequence until he hit L-1, and even then said the very minimum. Was close on policy lynched, until a second wagon was started on the slot that Kraska replaced into. Eventually, the lynch was down to between PenguinPower and Kraska; PenguinPower died (flipping Town) and Kraska narrowly (very narrowly) lived.<br><br>Also, during Day One, NotTheRealPaul got a vote or two and immediately (and unnecessarily) softed a PR pretty noticeably.<br><br>Night one, there was no kill. (My theory is that the Doctor and the Mafia both hit NTRP for his PR softing)<br><br>Early in Day Two, MuttonChopMagic and Kraska revealed that Kraska had got a PM overnight stating that MuttonChopMagic was innocent. MuttonChopMagic revealed that he was a Friendly Neighbour with a 1xLoyal modifier - the fact that Kraska had received his message meant Kraska must be Townsided as well. Which means that the two of them are either both Town or both Mafia and pulling off a massive bluff. (But both Town seems more likely to me - MCM can prove that by Friendly-Neighbouring more people in future nights).<br><br>--------------<br><br>So much for the highlights. Now, on to more speculative matters. Looking at the wagon on Not_Mafia (which is your slot - it's been through several players) yesterday, and comparing it to the votes on the proven-Townie PenguinPower lynch wagon, I notice that (if one ignores the likely-town MCM, Kraska and NTRP) three names are on both wagons - Backhand, Cheetory6, DeathRowKitty. Considering that the day one wagon on your slot was basically an easy policy lynch, the only way I can imagine that there wasn't a heavy scum presence on your wagon was if you yourself are scum. So, if you're Town, then at least one or two of those three pretty much have to be scum - while, on the flip side, if you're scum then I would assume that those three are all likely to be Town (in which case Nero Cain is very likely one of your scumbuddies).<br><br>I think you have a pretty decent chance of being scum, and the information we get from verification of your slot is massively valuable."}

Considering that the day one wagon on your slot was basically an easy policy lynch, the only way I can imagine that there wasn't a heavy scum presence on your wagon was if you yourself are scum. So, if you're Town, then at least one or two of those three pretty much have to be scum - while, on the flip side, if you're scum then I would assume that those three are all likely to be Town (in which case Nero Cain is very likely one of your scumbuddies).<br><br>I think you have a pretty decent chance of being scum, and the information we get from verification of your slot is massively valuable.</div></blockquote><br><br>So, for a start, I don't care about your read on me, so it's a waste of an opinion towards me.<br><br>However, explain to me how you come to the idea that either scum was on my wagon, or all town was and I'm scum? <br>Backhand, Cheetory6, DeathRowKitty - What do you think of these 3 players from how they played so far?"}

This game most of my town reads today and yesterday have been not very collaborative with me. Ex: Cheeorty doesn\u2019t care, Mutton has a speech impediment, Sling is abrasive, Kaseka has been scum reading me, Not Puel is never around. I wasn\u2019t able to motivate myself without support of \u201cx\u201d player(s) So I never got a good footing in this game.<br><br>I gernally prescribe to an idea that there are different positions that town needs at different times, and when those positions go unfilled that game state suffers. When motivated my game revolves around filling the holes in town\u2019s communication. So today I was hoping to simultaneously be towns heart and leader. I guess I\u2019m too late and therefore neither. <br><br>I am my strongest when I feel like I\u2019m the player that is putting forth the most effort to slove the game meanwhile bieng underestimated before doing so. Perhaps I counted on it happening this game- when I found the time to do it- and didn\u2019t consider the likihood that somebody way more caplable of an archetypical leadership role would come in before I had the chance to prove myself. <br><br>I had started setting some strategic thought down on a word doc Friday night to form a sort of plan. If I couldn\u2019t get on the same page with anybody, then I figured that I\u2019d have to force myself to get it together once I had a solid few hours to sit down and read the game. So starting today I was going to attempt to play OB!town supper hard, and get all my town reads into a town bloc. I even drafted out a series of things I wanted to go through, just to make sure I kept all my thoughts together!"}

I think it just makes me look really town like from scum pov. Which wouldn\u2019t be bad b/c getting night killed would mean that I wouldn\u2019t have to keep playing leader. It also gets anybody harboring scum/null reads onto something more meangful.     <br><br>Hopefully Nero actually is town. If so then I won\u2019t get lynched for assoiatives. I don\u2019r see a game where Scum!Nero won\u2019t incriminate me with his flip.

I think everybody is okay with Cheetory town.<br>Almost most wonder if I could just come right out and propose town bloc. Biggest issue is keeping it together I think.

A lot of the points being used for him being scummy just kind of strike me as things he would do possibly even moreso as town? I'm open to the idea of being wrong, but I'm not seeing anything that I find overly compelling for why this is scumNero vs townNero other than that maybe it seems like he doesn't have much interest in trying to figure anything out right now. He could just be town that just doesn't give a fuck about the game, and honestly I vibe with that. There hasn't been a clear scum option to me at any point this game and I've been super demotivated from that. I can buy him feeling similarly, especially since it's not just me who's struggling to keep their head in the game."}

I have a problem with a meta case that has no in-game reasoning (from several players) and that hasn't actually brought up any feasible examples. I think the only one brought up was a small discussion about Civ Mafia (something I'll dare not read) which isn't really a great example in any case. It's like how Grendel literally threw a scumread on me because he's watched two games with me and then I literally quoted a game where I've done similar behavior as town. The response?

Either Not_Mafia is Town or Not_Mafia is Mafia.<br><br>If Not_Mafia is Mafia: The people on his wagon are more probably Town than Scum. This causes Townleans for Backhand, Cheetory, DRK.

Just keep protecting MCM, and Town is basically guaranteed a win.<br><br>Now, assuming that all PR role reveals have been truthful; scum has a good chance of being Backhand/Grendel. The setup as it stands does look rather Townsided to me (having a Cop-equivalent in MCM and a Doctor-equivalent in the Rolestopper). I know that in newbie games, last I looked at that grid, the only way to end up with both Cop and Doc involved the Scum getting a Roleblocker. A Scum Roleblocker is, I think, still very much a possibility (if so, I expect he tried to roleblock MCM on Night 2 but was thwarted by the Rolestopper)<br><br>The other option for a Scum Power Role, of course, is our Motion Detector (and his backup). Scum could certainly do with a way to look for and identify the Rolestopper, and a Motion Detector seems like a good way to give the Scumteam this capability; an NTRP/Hiraki scumteam is very much on the cards.<br><br>A third option is that Vedith is lying; that we actually have a Doctor instead of a Rolestopper and Vedith is relying on the Doctor not speaking up to get away with his lie. (If anyone dies and flips Doctor, then Vedith needs to get lynched the very next day). (That we don't have a protective role at all seems unlikely - scum could have faked the Night One kill, but why not hit MCM on Night Two unless they were trying to dodge a Protective role?)<br><br>Between those two options, I have to say, I think Backhand/Grendel is the more likely scumteam.

He never showed up to the thread proper to post anything, and was not posting anywhere else on site. I even checked later. The 3rd of June was when this game started, Backhand has no posts in the other two games that were having game over discussion on the 3rd, but does have posts on the 2nd, and 4th. Backhands first post in this game was the 4th. Ei, Backhand was probably hiding out in the scum PT the day the game started.<br><br>This was the ethically gray thing I wasn't gonna mention.

It felt like he was looking at a check box for acceptable activity, and we made the grade.  Like little introspective about motivations outside of... maybe Kraska. Backhand was a very strong gut town read on Kraska from their entrance onward. <br> <br>I think that the only low content poster he town read was Not Puel, and that was over a town slip, and pr soft. <br><br>Overall it\u2019s a very black/white approach to the game for a player that doesn\u2019t seem to be a normally hard line player. I say this because Backhand keeps a pretty chill rhetoric even when annoyed this game. (I think that clashes a bit with his first game here where he was frustrated to the point of cursing and dramatics) Like I guess I could see him being a \u201cit is my way or nobodies\u201d if he had the same level of frustration at getting called out here that he did elsewhere, but I don\u2019t see that. Low content always equals scummy, high content is always town is a really simplistic way to view it.

He never showed up to the thread proper to post anything, and was not posting anywhere else on site. I even checked later. The 3rd of June was when this game started, Backhand has no posts in the other two games that were having game over discussion on the 3rd, but does have posts on the 2nd, and 4th. Backhands first post in this game was the 4th. Ei, Backhand was probably hiding out in the scum PT the day the game started.<br><br>This was the ethically gray thing I wasn't gonna mention.

Here, we have a pair of results that appear to be carefully planned to make a counterclaim impossible - \"forgot to submit an action\" is completely non-counterclaimable, and \"saw the confirmed PR who requested doctor protection move\" is, similarly, impossible to counterclaim.<br><br>But, in this case, there actually <span style=\"font-style: italic\">is</span> a possible counterclaim. See, last night (the last time Scum talked) we didn't know yet about the Rolestopper. Most people seemed to think there might be a Doctor - I know I did. And the Doctor does not stop motion detectors. But the Rolestopper <span style=\"font-style: italic\">does</span>.<br><br>MCM claimed a blown one-shot Loyal modifier. But he also (very strongly) requested Doctor support the following night. It looked obvious to me that his one-shot Loyal wasn't one-shot after all, and I can only assume that the Rolestopper saw the same - MCM's request was very strongly put. So, the Rolestopper would pretty much have to be on MCM. (This would also explain the apparent preponderance of Town power this game - I still think Scum has a roleblocker, who clashed with the rolestopper on MCM Night Two). With the Rolestopper on MCM, NTRP should not have gotten that motion result. (I'm thinking he stuck with the fakeclaim that had been planned in the Mafia chat the previous night, presumably by a more experienced player).<br><br>Hence, NTRP's motion detector results look completely fake.<br><br>That's the current centre of my NTRP case."}

He never showed up to the thread proper to post anything, and was not posting anywhere else on site. I even checked later. The 3rd of June was when this game started, Backhand has no posts in the other two games that were having game over discussion on the 3rd, but does have posts on the 2nd, and 4th. Backhands first post in this game was the 4th. Ei, Backhand was probably hiding out in the scum PT the day the game started.<br><br>This was the ethically gray thing I wasn't gonna mention.

I would also say I don't really expect early Day 1 \"this player is playing badly\" pushes to result in immediate lynches, its more \"this player is playing badly are they doing that because they're scum, or because they're bad\"  Then I stuck on Not_Mafia because he sure wasn't going to give any indication that he was anything other than bad and I did/do find it suspicious how many people were cool shrugging that off.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9402069#p9402069\" class=\"postlink\">post 2329</a>, CCC wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9396545#p9396545\" class=\"postlink\">post 2243</a>, Backhand wrote:</cite>Right, the Motion Detector and the Backup Motion Detector could both be either alignment.

Either he really is a town PR, or Scum used their first-48-hour scumtalk to carefully prepare fake claims. So, presumably, his investigative results were planned out in advance as well.<br><br>Now, Motion Detector is a weak role, but it's normally fairly easy to counterclaim. If he gives results, and claims no movement, then literally <span style=\"font-style: italic\">any</span> Town PR could counterclaim with the reason of \"but I visited him\". Here, we have a pair of results that appear to be carefully planned to make a counterclaim impossible - \"forgot to submit an action\" is completely non-counterclaimable, and \"saw the confirmed PR who requested doctor protection move\" is, similarly, impossible to counterclaim.<br><br>But, in this case, there actually <span style=\"font-style: italic\">is</span> a possible counterclaim. See, last night (the last time Scum talked) we didn't know yet about the Rolestopper. Most people seemed to think there might be a Doctor - I know I did. And the Doctor does not stop motion detectors. But the Rolestopper <span style=\"font-style: italic\">does</span>.<br><br>MCM claimed a blown one-shot Loyal modifier. But he also (very strongly) requested Doctor support the following night. It looked obvious to me that his one-shot Loyal wasn't one-shot after all, and I can only assume that the Rolestopper saw the same - MCM's request was very strongly put. So, the Rolestopper would pretty much have to be on MCM. (This would also explain the apparent preponderance of Town power this game - I still think Scum has a roleblocker, who clashed with the rolestopper on MCM Night Two). With the Rolestopper on MCM, NTRP should not have gotten that motion result. (I'm thinking he stuck with the fakeclaim that had been planned in the Mafia chat the previous night, presumably by a more experienced player).<br><br>Hence, NTRP's motion detector results look completely fake.<br><br>That's the current centre of my NTRP case.</div></blockquote><br><br>If this were to be the case, then the rolestopper really does need to claim.

Had a couple of busy RL days.<br><br>But I don't think it really matters, how or what we vote for. Vedith's the last scum, now that Backhand's been cleared; but there's no way Town can lose this game, now, anyway. In fact... I don't think a Town victory has been avoidable since... hmmm... day Two, really.<br><br>Consider: MCM is a Loyal Friendly Neighbour. He can produce one more Innocent result every day. Our hidden Rolestopper just needs to keep his rolestoppingness parked on MCM, and MCM is immortal; and it won't be long for the confirmed Innocents to outnumber the non-confirmed Innocents. Mafia is forced to randomly try to guess the Rolestopper's identity. All Town has to do is <a href=\"https://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Follow_the_Cop\" class=\"postlink\">follow the cop</a>, while Mafia frantically scrambles for and tries to kill the Rolestopper (or other protective role, it doesn't matter, he is proven to be able to stop kills).<br><br>Mafia is known to have had a one-shot Role Cop. Somehow, I don't think that that comes anywhere close to balancing out the Town-sided power of the MCM/ProtectorRole combo alone. And, on top of that, to suggest that the Protector Role had a <span style=\"font-style: italic\">backup</span>? We're talking about a pretty ludicrously Town-sided setup, here. Looking over the list of Normal roles, I have no idea what Mafia could have hiding in that last role that even begins to balance out this level of Town power; especially given that they have not been able to stop MCM yet.<br><br>Mafia could have a Traitor trying to help them out as well, I guess, but that Traitor won't do much at this point.<br><br>But, yeah. Between Backhand's claim, the day one all-Town wagon on NotMafia, and Vedith's role claim making this a ridiculously Town-sided game, I'm convinced Vedith's the last scum. Not that it matters - either NTRP or MCM will get another Innocent tonight, and we win. (Or one of them will get a guilty, and we win).

I don't think a Town victory has been avoidable since... hmmm... day Two, really.<br><br>Consider: MCM is a Loyal Friendly Neighbour. He can produce one more Innocent result every day. Our hidden Rolestopper just needs to keep his rolestoppingness parked on MCM, and MCM is immortal; and it won't be long for the confirmed Innocents to outnumber the non-confirmed Innocents. Mafia is forced to randomly try to guess the Rolestopper's identity. All Town has to do is <a href=\"https://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Follow_the_Cop\" class=\"postlink\">follow the cop</a>, while Mafia frantically scrambles for and tries to kill the Rolestopper (or other protective role, it doesn't matter, he is proven to be able to stop kills).<br><br>Mafia is known to have had a one-shot Role Cop. Somehow, I don't think that that comes anywhere close to balancing out the Town-sided power of the MCM/ProtectorRole combo alone. And, on top of that, to suggest that the Protector Role had a <span style=\"font-style: italic\">backup</span>? We're talking about a pretty ludicrously Town-sided setup, here. Looking over the list of Normal roles, I have no idea what Mafia could have hiding in that last role that even begins to balance out this level of Town power; especially given that they have not been able to stop MCM yet.<br><br>Mafia could have a Traitor trying to help them out as well, I guess, but that Traitor won't do much at this point.<br><br>But, yeah. Between Backhand's claim, the day one all-Town wagon on NotMafia, and Vedith's role claim making this a ridiculously Town-sided game, I'm convinced Vedith's the last scum. Not that it matters - either NTRP or MCM will get another Innocent tonight, and we win. (Or one of them will get a guilty, and we win). Scum pretty much have to have another PR or a traitor or <span style=\"font-style: italic\">something</span>, but I'm not sure it can help them at this point anyway.

MCM played the loyal friendly neighbor very well, drawing the doc protection (even if also the nightkill) and using it, IMO, on smart targets. kraska is a great target because she's someone he was presumably townreading but who wasn't strongly thought of as town in general consensus. Cheetory is a good target because after the d2 lynch, town were in a strong position so confirming an already-townread is a solid move. After d3 backhand was also a great choice, securing the early victory.<br><br>Obviously Cheetory stopping 2 kills, particularly the one on MCM, was massive. MCM dying leads to an entirely different game, as he was by far the strongest PR and an unlikely mislynch in the first place.<br><br>Scum blundered a bit with the n2 kill - they were trying to find the rolestopper, but unfortunately they hit one of the few in the dwindling pool of VTs who could have been lynch fodder in the medium term. It might have been (and in fact, we know now, would have been) better for them to bank on the doctor being in the confirmed players and just shoot blindly in them. <br><br>Overall though, I think this was ultimately a very cohesive town game. There was a lot of disjointed rhetoric around Vedith and Backhand and Slingshot for a lot of the game but eventually the town consolidated around their loudest or most forceful voices, and people generally did a good job of speaking up and following each in turn where appropriate. I don't think it was night play alone that won this for town."}
