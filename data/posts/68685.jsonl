You can find these <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=6470\" class=\"postlink\">HERE</a>.<br>\n- I reserve the right to modkill or force replace players if necessary.<br>\n- If you wish to communicate with me in thread, please bold your statements.<br>\n- If you have any complaints or other more delicate matters to discuss, drop me a PM.<br>\n- <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#DF0174\">&gt;&gt;This&lt;&lt;</div></div> is my modding colour. Do not use it, or anything too close to it that it could fool another player.<br>\n- Do not encrypt, hide, or otherwise make your text unreadable. You know the drill.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#DF0174\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">II Voting, Lynching, Death</div></div><br>\n- Votes will only count in the following two formats. The first one is preferable:<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Foxbird</span><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">VOTE: Foxbird</div><br>\n- Abbreviations and other player nicknames as well as typos are allowed in the votes - if I can recognize them, that is.<br>\n- A No Lynch is a possible vote option.<br>\n- A lynch will occur when a majority is reached. A majority is half the players alive, rounded down plus one.<br>\n- If there is no majority vote at deadline, there will be no lynch.<br>\n- Talking after deadline and/or lynch is allowed, up until the thread is locked.<br>\n- If you&#8217;re dead, do not continue posting in the thread. This includes &#8216;bah&#8217; posts of any kind.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#DF0174\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">III Activity</div></div><br>\n- Days will last two weeks.<br>\n- Nights will last two days (48 hours).<br>\n- Deadlines will be extended upon probable cause. You may also request extensions if you think they are needed.<br>\n- Should a replacement be found during a Night phase, the deadline will be extended regardless of the slot&#8217;s night actions.<br>\n- Night actions may be submitted via PM or bolded in the Mafia PT.<br>\n- Prods will occur after 48 hours of not posting. <br>\n- A player will be replaced if they fail to pick up their prod after 24 hours or immediately upon their third prod.<br>\n- V/LA should be PMed to the mod or announced in thread. Players are ineligible for prods during V/LA periods, though I reserve the right to replace a player, should their V/LA be so long that it disrupts the game.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#DF0174\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">IV Setup Information</div></div><br>\n- This is a closed setup using a 10:3 ratio.

Usually it's mafia, right? Also, adding such syntactical edits to a post indicates to me that the person kind of sat there for a moment and thought about what they were going to write because maybe they wanted to be careful about what they said. Normally this is expected behavior in a mafia game, however having this type of post come out so early feels a little off.<br>\n<br>\nAnyway, the remaining posts from Alpaca's ISO don't feel scummy, and the reaction to the L-1 and threat of hammer were within the realm of acceptability.

NULL.<br>\n<br>\nHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. What a build up, well I wasn't expecting that result TBH but I'm reporting it anyway...<br>\n<br>\nHe's actually leaning scum according to the results, but the variance in the error % calculation is disgusting so you can't trust the results at all. This means that his activity in his scum game is the same, actions are almost alike (in terms of grammatical edits, quoting, volume of words in posts, and such), and the tag comparison found a very weak correlation with his scum game. <br>\n<br>\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: normal; display: inline\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Based on the long winded post I made above, I want to see the D1 lynch placed on the following slots of {ARUN, SARU} for today.</div></div>", "time": "Wed Oct 12, 2016 7:50 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=68685&start=200", "forum": "53", "thread": "68685"}

Again, this could literally just be a random vote, but it could also be more then that (Illuminati confirmed).

Also since this was still in RVS he could get away with it no questions asked. <br>\n2. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8409033#p8409033\">79</a> He also seems to be very ancy to lynch people as soon as possible, also possibly switching his vote from me to avoid suspicion later on.<br>\n3. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8409782#p8409782\">101</a> Still not sure wtf \"It stood out to me so I pursued that weird feeling\" means or why you would do it, but it seems like kind of a weird thing to do. Anyways, he mentions that Nero's joke wagon on Alpaca was with legit reasoning and should be taken seriously (Which btw I still don't agree with Nero's reasoning but whatever, I'll get back to that later).

He's been aggressive throughout, and gets points in particular for calling out knighty's defense of alpaca and for pointing out iron's inconsistancies.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">karnos</div>. This one is more gut. There's not a ton to go on but I like karnos, particularly when viewed in ISO.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">alpaca</div>. He basically handled the early pressure fine, and though his posts aren't particularly illuminating, his inquisitiveness reads townish to me. Also, see below, I'm pretty sure he's being whiteknighted.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Null Megaposters</div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">iron</div>. Reading through the game I mostly consider him a positive force. Threatening to hammer alpaca early I thought was a good move to get the game moving, and several other times he's led, or has tried to lead, new wagons. But Nero pointed out iron's strange reversal in 159, which I tend to agree with. Why would iron laugh off someone who wanted to lynch alpaca if he himself had threatened to hammer.

I've seen newbtown do this, but I've also seen scum do this as an attempt to be extra sociable and win friends.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">aron</div>. Similar, though he's more active. There's way too much \"let's talk about how RVS works, let's talk about the nature of jokes, let's talk about random unrelated thing\" for my liking, but I can't decide whether this is a confused newb or an intentional diverting scum.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">scums</div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">LmkGuy</div>.  In ISO, he looks terrible.  Of his 14 posts, the first 12 are pure fluff, with some specifically, actively trying to derail the game back to RVS or some other non-threatening null state.  157 in particular bothers me. He's trying to play the \"adult in the room\" angle a little to hard and looking to slide by unnoticed.  Find me a post where he attacks anyone, in any meaningful sense (that was rhetorical.  there is none) The best he can muster is a post where he half-assedly votes iron, then immediately equivocates with a \"hopefully this can get him playing a bit more seriously.\"  Look in the mirror, chief.  When the game gets serious, LmkGuy lurks.  When he can jump in with a quip or an upbeat emoticon, he pounces.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">knighty</div>.  I've mentioned some of this already.  His immediate and repeated defense of alpaca, starting in post 43, makes no sense, unless (a) he's protecting a buddy, or (b) he's trying to pocket an imperiled town on the verge of mislynch.  I suspect it's the latter, only because I doubt scumbuddies would defend each other THAT obviously, but in either scenario knighy is scum. When he's called on this, he backs down in post 90, saying he's \"just trying to point things out.\"  This is a weak retreat: he got caught and he's trying to get out of trouble. Even 251 reads overpolished and contrived.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">cmit</div>.  I'm put off by his refusal to list any reads, even as late as post 221. I don't think he's newbtown, I think he's newbscum playing the unfrozen caveman lawyer defense.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">penguin</div>.  Reads similar to LmkGuy, but less so.  He spent a lot of time early trying to make jokes and prove his winning personality.  He's improved, slightly, perhaps, but still seems to post only when there's a light moment he can pounce on.  I also don't like how he egged iron on to hammer alpaca early, only to more or less immediately say how the threat wasn't serious.<br>\n<br>\nLmk and knighty are my preferences.

He pretty much coasted through RVS and stopped posting after voting Alpaca and saying he didn't like Penguins signature which, on that topic, he has a 7-0 as scum, maybe by doing exactly what he is doing rn (unless of course that WL is faked). He hasn't called V/LA so unless he's dead irl, he is probably waiting for people to forget about him, which we did. Possible scum waiting till the iron (not the player) is hot to strike.<br>\n<br>\nSaru also hasn't said anything (besides page 1 RVS) until <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8411798#p8411798\">197</a> 8 pages later... As for his argument in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8417218#p8417218\">316</a> he is pretty much doing the same thing, his 7 posts except for a few were asking about Iron's code. So Saru has like 2 or 3 posts that had some substance but the thing about Tracer was already an idea at that point, so more like 1 or 2 substantial posts. Still null on Saru, really just hasn't said enough to give me an opinion either way.<br>\n<br>\nLowell has said barely anything including RVS which, to be fair, he was trying to help out but after that, he went silent except for a post calling my read on Arona \"opportunistic\" which, after I explained he went back to being silent. Lowell also hasn't really said a whole lot, like... less than anyone else... and with less content as well.

I'm not a long time veteran, but I have been playing here for some 9 months or so I think. When I first started, I played like this, and I got scum-read for it, and sometimes miss-lynched. After a few games I adjusted my play style to something that fits more into the general \"town meta\" of these boards, and didn't get miss-lynched as often, but it didn't actually make me win any more often as town. <br>\n<br>\nI've come to realize that playing to the meta is really just playing to lose. At best you play the same as everyone else and maybe have a 50% chance to win, but anyone smart enough to play in a way that counters the general meta style will easily deceive you. I'm not going to play to lose. If it gets my lynched because my fellow town players are too dumb to think there might be a way to play other than standard meta, so be it- if that is the case is probably a loser game for town anyway, so my lynch won't change anything anyway. So that is where this defeatist attitude comes from. I am not going to change my play style, I am not going to give you your \"reads\" you want so bad, because it's BAD PLAY.<br>\n<br>\nI mean, the most hilarious thing to me about the common meta here is that giving town reads is seen as A+++ good townie move, but any speculation at all about power roles is super bad scummy play. Except if someone is actually scum, they can discuss PR in scum chat, while town reads just give scum a guide on who to kill first, who to bus, etc. It's hilariously bad logic, but because it's become ingrained into the meta here everyone seems to think it's a good way to play.", "time": "Mon Oct 17, 2016 2:02 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=68685&start=375", "forum": "53", "thread": "68685"}

But if you don't give out town reads as specific as that, all the scum really gets is that X people scum read karnos, no idea about the rest... they have less information. </div></blockquote>\nIf scum can't figure out confirmed town and obvious null read lurkers and then look at scum reads to not be able to figure out town reads - then I think town has less things to worry about then stating their town reads.<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8427802#p8427802\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8427802#p8427802\" data-post-id=\"8427802\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 388</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=27584\">karnos</a> wrote:</cite>It's good to keep  town power roles secret from scum, everyone agrees on that.

So it mainly felt he was just making excuses for not wanting to do anything. It got even worse when he revealed that he read Iron as town and was therefore willing to vote with Iron, which seemed to go against his stated views and exception to those views. <br>\n<br>\nBut then Thor came in and he started to make similar or pretty much the same arguments that I was getting at, which made me feel a bit paranoid that he was buddying me or taking advantage.

He's got that whole 'indefinite V/La' thing going on. We are essentially voting this guy right now due to him being active on site, but not posting on the thread. Do we really gain anything from lynching him (unless he is scum ofc). We don't get any information on associates and he has no relevant reads that we can use based on his flip. For these reasons I am not really down to lynch him and would think that he either needs to be replaced or give us a time when he will be back.<br>\n<br>\nThe PR claim by Fire is interesting, and I guess we have to take him for his word for now. <br>\n<br>\nI would put both Thor and Saru at null right now and I don't really feel confident in lynching either of them.<br>\n<br>\nLowell's latest post is weird.

With this in mind, Lowell is basically voting to kill null/town!Saru (in his eyes), even though he has \"scum\" reads. As town, would you not be better off identifying at LEAST one of your scum reads, posting reasoning and voting for them?

You could make the argument that he has posted little value to the thread, but is that really what we want to lynch over? It's not something I am ruling out completely, but if we have a proper reason to lynch someone, isnt that better? At least we will get some sort of information from it. If mal flips town, we literally gain nothing. <br>\n<br>\nSo either we find a better alternative or make a high risk lynch. <br>\n<br>\n@mod: Surely mal needs to give some sort of estimate as to when he will be back. He can't just say indefinite V/LA and then come back D6 and win the game (exaggeration of course).

But your feelings are unfounded and it's a bit strange how you went from calling me a \"lurker null read\"(which makes no sense) to voting me because my wagon dissipated. What happened to the 3 or 4 other lynches you mentioned in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8445942#p8445942\">681</a>. Why not talk about them, or do they not exist? <br>\n<br>\nEither you're ignoring the fact that I had claimed when people started to unvote(which would imply they believed the claim or felt comfortable with it) or you're ignoring the fact that votes shifted to malp quickly because a) he was an easy target to wagon on because b) there was almost no time left in the day, even after an extension and because c) he wasn't around to defend himself. Neither would suggest my wagon falling apart because I'm scum, as you seem to imply. In fact, IME, most scum wagons in the early-game fall apart before a claim, rather than after. Scum don't want to be pinned into a claim so early in the game and so most scum partners would try to derail it halfway through, even subtly. Basically no one in the game was trying to actively or subtly derail my wagon D1. <br>\n<br>\nAlso, this is definitely not the town!Lowell I remember from our last game together. You've lurked 24/7(this matches up slightly), have less posts than some replacements, and have done generally nothing, even going as far as to admit to not having a case for your vote, even though you imply you have others you want to lynch more than myself. There's no reason for me to think you're town here. But if you are, thanks for being a team player lmfao. <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":roll:\" title=\"Rolling Eyes\"><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Thor665</span> but this can go to Lowell if he keeps up the shit play.", "time": "Wed Oct 26, 2016 12:23 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=68685&start=800", "forum": "53", "thread": "68685"}

It's a mix between the tunneling and the feeling that I'm being buddied.

I actually was under no pressure by Grey, because Grey was only pushing me with only 1 vote on me. I couldn't feel pressure from him even if I wanted to. There was no indication I was going to be lynched when Grey was pushing on me or that his push would even lead to my lynch, so me revealing how I was feeling Thor those past couple of days couldn't possibly have anything to do with pressure. It could just be, oh, you know, my actual feelings? <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\"><br>\n<br>\nAs scum in that situation, I would have just eternally kept up on Karnos (he was the leading wagon, after all) and would have either dismissed Grey or just blatantly link him as a partner to Karnos. I don't see a world in which myself as scum does what I did there given the situation at the time which was vote off Karnos and then move onto Knight/Thor. It doesn't add up, frankly.<br>\n<br>\nYou're asking me to clarify the arguments about Karnos, yeah? Thor was the first to bring up the iron townread contradiction(that was my mistake), but even if you take that away, I'm not a happy camper with his push on Karnos, as you also don't seem to be.

Literally the same page Nero (sort of) calls out lmk for his interaction with alpaca, lmk posts this.  Since lmk complains there's no case on him, here it is again.  He lurks, then when he does post he refuses to take a stand on anything he can't immediately back away from.  This reads as coaching, trying to coax alpaca back into the game now that his name is mentioned again.  Or, at very least, setting up a safe vote for himself on someone who won't fight back in case he needs it.<br>\n<br>\nI could easily see an lmk/alapaca pair.  My only reservation being that they're BOTH such lurkers that it's hard to imagine them orchestrating a mislynch on D1.<br>\n<br>\nGoing to go back and look at D1 saru wagon dissolving into mal wagon next.  I think it's an either/or situation though.  Either this was a scumled derailment of saru-scum wagon or this lmk/alpaca lurker-alliance.

{"number": 990, "id": "8473357", "user": "bji", "user_id": "25099", "content": "OK so I read all 40 pages.  Mostly all I got was buyer's remorse, but I do have a few clear(ish) thoughts:<br>\n<br>\n- The day 1 lynch was piss-poor in my opinion.  For all of the accusations flying around of players not basing their reads on demonstrably credible reasoning, the idea of lynching a lurker on Day 1 because \"he appears to be active elsewhere on the site\" is utterly ridiculous.  I mean how is not playing the game any more scum than it is town?  Would scum really be so obvious as to avoid play like that?  Bad bad wagon.  So I will have to analyze that wagon and how it went down a little more clearly on a second more focused read, because I think I might be able to get some good reads from that.<br>\n<br>\n- I tend to look for subtle interactions more than obvious ones.  Sure some people have put forth dumb theories or sometimes have not been entirely self-consistent in their reasoning, but that stuff is just as likely to happen for town as for scum.  I don't find the argument that \"X must be scum because I defeated X's position on Y\" particularly compelling. Regarding subtle stuff, I find aronagrundy's posts and votes to repeatedly tingle my spidey-senses, I feel like there is alot of subtle maneuvering there.  I'll provide more detail later in this post.<br>\n<br>\n- ironstove is high on my list of interesting persons.  I appreciate how he's tried to drive wagons repeatedly and all of them seemed well justified to me.<br>\n<br>\n- I think Knighty Knight was lying about not having played before.  His grasp of the game lingo was too strong for someone who hasn't played before.  He was replaced by someone who has claimed a power role.  I would tend to believe that Knightly Knight was trying to feign newbishness as a means of providing him some \"space to work\" with his PR, so that he could say and do seemingly dumb things that had a PR purpose, without being suspected of having a PR.  For this reason, and others (mostly related to Fire Assassin's posts on the PR subject themselves), I believe that Fire Assassin is a confirmed town PR.<br>\n<br>\nI have two strong town reads at the moment: Fire Assassin, and ironstove.  I already explained why above.<br>\n<br>\nI have one really strong scum read: aronagrundy.  My reasoning here, is twofold: I generally don't like the tone of his posts, they feel a bit slimy, he feels like he is just trying to prod town along to making mislynches, more than actually scum hunting.  And the quantity and timing, just seems carefully planned, he pops up just enough to guide or participate in bad wagons.<br>\n<br>\nThe second issue I have with aranogrundy is his voting record.  It's really bad.<br>\n<br>\nHe spends most of post-RVS Day 1 voting Knighty Knight, whom I feel never really deserved a vote, and then jumps over to malpascp when it's clear that that wagon has momentum, happy to stay on that terrible wagon with the only two players he had previously voted for (Fire Assassin and PenguinPower).

In fact, my last post from D1 is <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8445978#p8445978\">682</a>.<br>\n<br>\nSo, since I wasn't around, I couldn't have answered a question I didn't even know existed. To further prove my point about this, notice my very first post on D2 (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8459125#p8459125\">811</a>). Guess what? It was a reply to the question that you're claiming I was trying to dodge or something stupid. <br>\n<br>\nLastly, you really are making a superficial argument against me at this point. You're looking at action, but not motivation. There's no scum motivation for me to ignore your question one time and then answer it when you ask again. If anything, that only makes me look bad. You think that I think I can get away with straight up not responding to people or something? You make it sound like you asked me about Thor like 10 million times before I responded, when really, it was only twice. There's no dodging or avoiding anything there, otherwise, I'd just keep doing it, which, again, makes no sense from any perspective.", "time": "Wed Nov 02, 2016 12:02 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=68685&start=975", "forum": "53", "thread": "68685"}

You say the Karnos wagon wasn't going to last, but you can't prove that. I had no reason to move off of Karnos as scum. His wagon was going fine, and one person coming in (who never questioned the wagon btw) questioning me about my ISO being full of Karnos wouldn't be enough to make me stop as scum. No pressure existed, so you can stop acting like it did, thanks.<br>\n<br>\nAlso, I hopped off the FA wagon because he started actually doing something with the slot he replaced into. Notice that I voted for Knight for his lacking posts, which FA made up for. How scummy of me to hop off the wagon of a slot which starts doing the opposite of what I scum read it for! :O<br>\n<br>\nI also did not change my reason on the Thor push. If I knew it wouldn't hold up from D1 (as you say), I would have conveniently dropped it D1 and replaced it with something else, which is not what happened. I had a two part reason for not feeling good about Thor from D1. I would have gotten rid of the \"copying\" argument much earlier, according to your logic. <br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>aronagrundy wrote:</cite>Also yes I think that ignoring people can be a valid strategy for scum because scum benefits from not providing too much information, and sometimes people don't follow up on questions or they're just afterthoughts.

The only players I would have avoided voting for are ironstove and Knighty Knight/Fire Assassin.  I would have favored voting for aronagrundy or one of the { karnos, Saru  } duo.  Looking back at my notes, which started out more detailed but as you can imagine got sparser as the read through wore on and I got tired, I didn't like the karnos/sanu exchange where they traded insults about some other game, and I seemed to dislike karnos' involvement more than disliking saru's, especially karnos' vote on saru.  But that fight seemed \"weird\" enough to me to put them both under some suspicion.<br>\n<br>\nI'm not that experienced at this game but I am under absolutely no illusions that I'm going to figure much out on Day 1, so as long as interactions happen, and a vote is placed on a player who was meaningfully involved, I'm pretty OK with it.  What I really don't like about that day 1 lynch was that it was against a player who was not meaningfully involved.<br>\n<br>\nI still have to re-read that mislynch wagon a little more closely and see if anything stands out.

I am under no illusion that ironstove actually believed that he was hammering FA.  His post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8443054#p8443054\">652</a> makes it pretty clear that he was just reaction testing FA.

Post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8446498#p8446498\">689</a> Nero Cain says \"so scum is voting Thor. Does this mean Saru is a scumbuddy or he's voting off the wagon to manipulate us onto the Saru wagon?\".  Who was voting Thor?  Saru, FA, and ironstove.  Saying \"Does this mean Saru is a scumbuddy\" means that Nero must have been referring to one or both of the other two as scum.  If Nero thought that FA was scum presumably he'd be focused on hammering him instead of pushing a new wagon.  That leaves ironstove.  This is consistent with his earlier postings wrt ironstove.

This looks bad to me.  Sheeping didn't fit into any part of Thor's approach up to this point.  I felt like he was being methodical and consistent previously and then all of a sudden is happy to be on a wagon that makes no sense?  Highly suspect.<br>\n<br>\nNero Cain post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8447742#p8447742\">702</a> makes it very clear that ironstove was the scum he was referring to being on the Thor wagon.<br>\n<br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8447890#p8447890\">703</a> to <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8447915#p8447915\">707</a> ironstove bounces from lowell to Mal, becoming fourth on the Mal wagon.  It seems like he does it in response to interaction with Nero Cain, who thinks iron is scum.  Is ironstove joining the Mal wagon just to test Nero Cain's response to having his top scum read join his wagon?  I can't see any other reason given by ironstove for the vote.

Thor seems to me to be too experienced at this game to actively be preferring a bad lynch to his earlier lynch targets.<br>\n<br>\nFollowing posts (I'm getting tired of typing post links, find the posts yourself) have karnos trying to get people off the Mal wagon using good reasoning.  BUT THEN post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8450132#p8450132\">767</a> he totally does a 180 and votes him to L-2.<br>\n<br>\nSoon thereafter ironstove does his own 180 and puts Mal on L-1.  WTF is going on here?<br>\n<br>\nNero's post immediately after that claims that \"Mal prob filps scum here.  I tend to think that his buddies are in LMK, PP, and Stove.\"  If Nero is scum he would have known that Mal is town, so he'd be weakening his own case against Ironstove by this post, suggesting he'd rather target LMK or PP for the next mislynch in day 2.<br>\n<br>\nThor comes on strong after that to push the Mal wagon.  He's pushing what was a mislynch at L-1.  I don't like this.<br>\n<br>\nGreyICE hammers.  We know GreyICE was town so  I will trust that his reasoning really was policy lynch.  I don't agree with that, but there it is.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nOK so ... out of all of this, here are my conclusions:<br>\n<br>\n- I don't know why Nero would prefer a Mal lynch over Ironstove, or why Nero moved his vote off of Ironstove and onto Mal.  This is really bad.<br>\n- I don't know why Nero completely ignored the fact that his top scum read had joined his wagon on Mal<br>\n- LmkGuy, kamos, and GreyICE were the only players I saw really trying to put the brakes on the mad Mal wagon<br>\n- Thor looks opportunistic and bad in all of this<br>\n- ironstove confuses me, his overall contributions have been very towny to me but his presence on this wagon and the way it went down at the end are very troubling<br>\n<br>\nSo this analysis lets me further refine my reads.<br>\n<br>\nTown: Fire Assassin<br>\nLean Town: ironstove, LmkGuy, Kamos<br>\nLean Scum: Nero Cain<br>\nScum: Thor<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Thor</span>", "time": "Thu Nov 03, 2016 7:40 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=68685&start=1025", "forum": "53", "thread": "68685"}

When I post that I don't like what people did, that doesn't mean that I am scum reading them, it means that I don't like what they did and will consider it in the overall body of evidence I use when analyzing that person.  The fact that karnos was not mentioned as a scum read in any of the two explicit reads lists I have given (post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8473357#p8473357\">990</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8475248#p8475248\">1032</a>) is my proof that I never scum read him.

He's explained it in a way that is at at least palatable though, and he never to my knowledge claimed that Mal was scum, just that he was a lurker and that it was mostly a policy lynch.

This is something we should consider and not lynch a lazy slot that should have been mature enough to replace out while they coast through the game <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">BUT</div> we shouldn't even consider this.\" PBBBT!<br>\n<br>\nAs an example, <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=23&amp;t=67600\" class=\"postlink\">this</a> game had a player that flipped scum while constantly posting elsewhere.<br>\n <br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\"><br>\nbut its just one example!  </div><br>\n<br>\nThere are more but I don't feel like slogging through my past games to find them. Its a somewhat common scumtell.</div></blockquote>\n\nThe difference is that the others all agreed that it was policy lynch, but you explicitly called Mal scum on several occasions.  That's not objectively discussing the merits of a last minute policy lynch, that's trying to push it, and is a bridge too far if you ask me.<br>\n<br>\nHere's the thing.  We have only a few pieces of undeniably true data in this game.  A major piece of objective information is that Mal was town and was fairly quickly lynched at the end of Day 1, in what read to me as a flurry of people giving up on their prior cases and just deciding to join that wagon.  Mass hysteria?  I dunno, but I would be more likely to believe that at least one or two people on that wagon were scum.  My two most likely candidates are you and Thor, for reasons I have already given.", "time": "Fri Nov 04, 2016 6:13 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=68685&start=1075", "forum": "53", "thread": "68685"}

Neither would suggest my wagon falling apart because I'm scum, as you seem to imply. In fact, IME, most scum wagons in the early-game fall apart before a claim, rather than after. Scum don't want to be pinned into a claim so early in the game and so most scum partners would try to derail it halfway through, even subtly. Basically no one in the game was trying to actively or subtly derail my wagon D1.</div></blockquote>\nI saw the claim, but I don't understand what you think it means.  You're saying your VT claim is so airtight that everyone just up and decided you must be town?  To your points, I would say: (a) you were an even EASIER wagon since you were almost dead and claimed VT, (b) why move from a VT claim to an unknown lurker at the last minute?, and (c) who would have it in their interest to move to an unknown lurker over you (who can defend himself, as you say) at the last minute if you're town?<br>\n<br>\nBasically, I don't see how the following narrative: \"I almost got lynched right at deadline, claimed VT, then a powerwagon instantly formed on a lurker who can't defend himself\" absolves you.", "time": "Mon Nov 07, 2016 3:24 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=68685&start=1100", "forum": "53", "thread": "68685"}

I wasn't a part of it in real time so maybe I'd have felt differently about it if I was, but reading it after the fact, it's just really hard for me to believe that this mislynch happened without scum help.<br>\n<br>\nAgain, almost everybody abandoned their Day 1 cases to join a fairly quick mislynch based on what I think is patently poor logic, and furthermore, targeted at a player who had had zero meaningul interactions and was, therefore, the least valuable mislynch if he was to be a mislynch (and he was).<br>\n<br>\nIt's very, very hard for me to believe that all of those factors happened by chance.  Of course it's possible, but this is a game of odds and those odds don't seem good to me.<br>\n<br>\nSo now, I had to ask myself, who are the most likely scum drivers or participants of that wagon?<br>\n<br>\nThe wagon had Nero Cain, Fire Assassin, Thor, aronagrundy, karnos, ironstove, and GreyICE.<br>\n<br>\nGreyICE is out because already dead town.<br>\nironstove is one of my top town reads for other reasons that I have already stated, so I'm not going to focus on him when I have better choices.<br>\nkarnos, same.<br>\naronagrundy would be my third choice for scum, and I would vote him absent other choices.  I tried to push a little on aronagrundy but I felt like his reasoning in response did seem sincere, and additionally, he doesn't post a lot so it's easy to lose focus on him when other people I am interested in are posting more.  That being said, not posting alot should not be a free pass to coasting through so I'd still be happy to pressure aronagrundy if anyone else in this game would bother to try with me.<br>\nThor - I didn't like his unexplained sheep vote and I don't feel like any of the reasons he gave for voting Mal were even remotely as well explained as any of his other reasons for vfoting any of the other people he's voted.  So he's a strong candidate for scum on this wagon from my perspective.<br>\nFire Assassin I have as a town read because of the claim and the way that the NK went down, so I'm not focusing on him while other better candidates are present.<br>\nNero Cain started the wagon, which I didn't like, and I really didn't like his defenses, which also involved outright misrepresentations of other players' reasons for being on that wagon, which I elaborated on in post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8477806#p8477806\">1089</a>.<br>\n<br>\nI'd lynch one of { Thor, Nero Cain, aronagrundy } today.<br>\n<br>\nUntil and unless I do a deep re-examination of the game, I don't see my stance changing there.

So I guess we already have just about everyone who is going to contribute in here already.<br>\n<br>\nSo in the interest of trying to get things moving forward, let's step back and take a look at this game.  Thor and myself are the two hottest wagons at the moment.  And yet there are some players who are piddling around with wagons that clearly aren't going anywhere.  I present to you: LmkGuy, Lowell, and Saru.<br>\n<br>\nLmkGuy has a very bland ISO.  One thing that caught my eye was post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8449830#p8449830\">741</a> where he said \"Maybe everyone should post a few reason why they want a certain person lynched\", but then he doesn't actually follow through and provide \"a few reason\" why he wants anyone lynched.  This is either very lazy scumhunting, or is an attempt to just kind of coast while looking like he is trying to scumhunt.  I mean if you think that everyone posting some concise reasons for a vote is needed to get clarity in the game, why wouldn't you start out by doing it yourself?  Unless you actually didn't care or didn't believe what you were saying?<br>\n<br>\nThat being said, his whole game reads as just lazy so it could just be that.  Plus he's going to be replaced so I'd much rather see what his replacement says that relying on his ISO for evaluating his slot at this point.<br>\n<br>\nLowell has never voted anyone that I have a scum read on, while at the same time town reading me at every opportunity.  He's so not present that he's been slipping under my radar but on re-read of his ISO and paying closer attention to his votes, I am getting a pretty icky feeling about him.  He's also not given a single opinion about the Thor wagon or my wagon.  Lowell - if you had to choose between me and Thor, who would you vote and why?<br>\n<br>\nSaru is completely hung up on his fight with Lowell and is basically not interacting with the rest of the game, except to occasionally defend himself whenever anyone such as aronagrundy mentions him.  If I recall he spent quite a bit of his time on Day 1 in a tit-for-tat with karnos.  Saru -- do you have any plans to scumhunt any further than the person you happen to be in a fight with at the moment?<br>\n<br>\nPEdit - Yes Thor I mislynched you in our only other game together.  But I've already stated numerous times that I'm not going to let other games influence my decision making in this game.  Unless and until I read every game you've ever played, and can evaluate all of your play instead of one example, I'm not going to look at just one example of your play and try to extrapolate anything from that.  And besides, if you are a skilled player, and I believe you are, then your scum play should look just like your town play, and you do look pretty similar in this game as you did in the other.  But of course, I'm not even factoring that into my case against you.  But keep squirming, it's fun to watch ...", "time": "Tue Nov 08, 2016 6:40 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=68685&start=1200", "forum": "53", "thread": "68685"}

And LMK did defend you by trying to derail your wagon by casting a naked vote for someone with no chance of being lynched at deadline (me).  I made this point when casting the vote.  Honestly you're not even trying at this point.  The main point is you had a wagon with time running out, you claimed VT, which miraculously saved you and strung up a lurker.  Even the way you were talking \"well, I guess I'm about to die\" and all that stuff looks in hindsight like a total put-on.</div></blockquote>\nYour first sentence made zero sense. You're the one who's definitely not even trying anymore. But of course, you seem to love the pot calling the kettle black tactic. You did the same thing with calling me a lurker on D1 where you had like ten posts or something. You also dodged the point (again) about why my scum partners didn't come to my defense in the first place, instead of letting me even get to the claim stage. <br>\n<br>\nSecondly, your vote on LMK doesn't match up at all with your feelings about me or the people who switched to the malp wagon. Not one bit. LMK DIDN'T defend me at all. Not in words, and not in vote, and you know this. The first person to even suggest the malp wagon was in fact Nero. LMK has had zero influence in that regard. You just needed to vote a player who was inactive to make sure you didn't get into conflict with anyone, and LMK was that guy. Everyone who was ACTUALLY on the malp wagon were either your buddies or people who were too vocal for you to have had challenged at the time. <br>\n<br>\nHonestly, I feel like saying so much more but your arguments are so objectively bad and I just don't think I can keep arguing with such obvious scum. It's a real shame that we only have a couple of hours left, but I would implore people to lynch Lowell ASAP. We still have time, but, meh, maybe not enough given that his scum partners would most likely push back anyways. <br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8498993#p8498993\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8498993#p8498993\" data-post-id=\"8498993\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 1281</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3450\">Lowell</a> wrote:</cite>Lurking doesn't make me scum, and you know it.</div></blockquote>\nThis guy just literally admitted to lurking.

These are not scum motivated posts, and not posts that feel like a scum!karnos would make. <br>\n<br>\nThen regarding saru, the posts I highlighted above make him look relatively scummy until : <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8437042#p8437042\">515</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8437107#p8437107\">519</a>, and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8443235#p8443235\">662</a>.<br>\n<br>\nThese posts are super towny, at least I thought up until the point that thor flipped encryptor. I imagine it's possible that Saru received some coaching from daychat to formulate the posts I wrote above. I say this because Saru has remained extremely inconsistent. He says he's left handed but still writes with his right. <br>\n<br>\nlike <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8443420#p8443420\">673</a>, he indicates that KnightyKnight is a scum read despite the fact that knight's vote is parked on the Thor slot. Interesting that Saru says in 662 'I am almost certain that Thor is scum' and in the following post tries to FOS someone who is voting someone who voting a slot whom 'he is almost certain is scum'. Clearly a major slip here. <br>\n<br>\nMajor actions on why nero/saru are most likely scum this game:<br>\n<br>\n1. Nero pushing the heavy mal lynch, off of his partners saru and thor. Yet he knows this is a slot that can't claim, we're lynching this slot for inactivity... Incredibly scummy wagon, yet he calls out karnos as scummy for voting thor with no chance for town to discuss even though we're discussing right now, so what's the issue? My belief is that this was because thor/saru are the PRs, like thor is obviously encryptor, but saru has to be roleblocker at this point.<br>\n<br>\nNero also made <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8450284#p8450284\">772</a> which I would say clears penguin if nero flips scum, and implicates saru further. <br>\n<br>\n2. Saru indicating <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8443235#p8443235\">662</a> which was made sense up until it came time to stand by his words, he parked his vote on lowel, who was neither knightyknight, or thor, when thor was in hammer range. I.e. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8498003#p8498003\">1260</a> he says giving intent to hammer and he returns and doesn't hammer. Thor follows in with a scummy tracker claim and then saru makes this disgusting post in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8508149#p8508149\">1339</a> trying to pin the nl on lowell, when his inaction caused the result as well, using the tracker claim as an excuse LOL.<br>\n<br>\nNow we're here in D4, nero is trying to ML karnos saying the quickhammer killed town discussion and disallowed scum hunting. This is a bullshit excuse and those of you that are buying it are fools because quick hammering in that situation DOES NOTHING but stop THOR WHO HAS AVOIDED BEING THE LYNCH FOR 2 DAYS IN A ROW FROM GETTING AWAY A 3RD DAY. AND WE CAN EASILY SCUM HUNT THE FOLLOWING DAY. <br>\n<br>\nIn all seriousness, please explain to me 1 reason why quick hammering there is so bad? What could we have done then that we can't do today? NOTHING.<br>\n<br>\nSo I say lynch between {saru, nero}, if either one flips town, we need to reassess the {lowell, penguin} pool, but at this point, town are in {bji, karnos, math}", "time": "Wed Nov 16, 2016 3:43 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=68685&start=1550", "forum": "53", "thread": "68685"}

His reasoning isn't anything new, so he should have been scum reading me all along based on it. Yet, just yesterday he was saying he would tunnel-vote me forever if Thor flipped town, so presumably the scum flip of Thor should make me more towny in his eyes, yet instead it seems to have had the opposite effect.<br>\n<br>\nNow if he is scum, it *still* doesn't make a lot of sense, but I think I am seeing why this is happening. In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8519384#p8519384\">1431</a> I said <div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF8000\">\"I'm still pretty sure scum are among the nero:lowell:mathblade:saru pool. Lowell, assuming for the moment you are town, and mathblade is indeed confirmed IC, between nero and saru which one is most obvious scum?\"</div> Shortly after that (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8519761#p8519761\">1474</a>) penguin voted me.<br>\n<br>\nIt was really puzzling me, why the turn, but I think I may have figured it out. My comment to Lowell was based on the idea that Lowell, whether scum or town, would never admit to being scum, so either way he was only going to admit to a scenario in which he was town. I wasn't town reading him, I just wanted to phrase my question in a way that he might give a useful response. But maybe Penguin thought I was, and he knew that his partner was among nero:saru pool, which meant we could lynch both, deal with taking one miss lynch, and then possibly lynch him, so he panicked and decided to try to push a wagon on me. It feels like a stretch because it is: I really thought penguin could be town this game, I just see zero town incentive to turn this day into a 1vs1 lynch situation when there were more likely scum to pick from.<br>\n<br>\nBetween nero and saru, which one would be penguin's partner?", "time": "Wed Nov 16, 2016 4:38 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=68685&start=1575", "forum": "53", "thread": "68685"}

It was my impression that you are trying to make points about why Karnos' hammer of Thor made no sense, and was trying to use the fact that Karnos never voted for Thor day 1 and otherwise mostly had his vote on Saru as evidence for this.  The point I am trying to make is that Karnos may have had his vote mostly on Saru but he expressed tremendous interest in Thor and called him scum numerous times along with Saru, so to me, a Karnos hammer of Thor is not inconsistent with his position.  And when I say that your argument is a misrep, it's because Karnos' position was so clear and his vote on Thor so wells supported by his previous postings, that to suggest otherwise doesn't seem like it can have an innocent motivation.<br>\n<br>\nAlso I think that it's patently false to say that if you don't vote someone, then all of your statements about them are just empty words.  There were 3 scum on Day 1 and one can't vote all three at once so does that mean that on day 1 it's not possible to have more than one scum read?  And that it's not possible to make any more progress towards winning the game than to place a vote on one scum?  Where \"progress\" here means placing suspicion on the one suspected scum you happen to be voting?   Obviously not, therefore your statement is false.<br>\n<br>\nFinally, let's assume that what you say is true, and that only votes count.  Then Karnos redeemed himself by voting Thor didn't he?  Because he finally did something beyond \"empty words\" with regards to Thor?<br>\n<br>\nBy saying that his repeated talking about and question of Thor and also outright calling Thor scum, but not voting him, was scummy, and also saying that his actual vote of Thor was scummy, you are basically in retrospect making Karnos' scumminess a truism; he was scummy if he did vote Thor, and scummy if he didn't, according to your position.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>PenguinPower wrote:</cite>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8442392#p8442392\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8442392#p8442392\" data-post-id=\"8442392\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 608</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=27584\">karnos</a> wrote:</cite>Town: it's a scum claim to quick hammer, don't do it.</div></blockquote>\n\nNice scum claim quickhammering Thor.</div></blockquote>\n\nYou see, this also feels misreppy to me.  The Thor hammer was not a traditional quickhammer, so here you are misrepresenting the hammer to make it fit your position against Karnos.<br>\n<br>\nI think most people would recognize, and those who don't need some education, that a quickhammer is a hammer that is done without giving time for town to discuss the now very imminent lynch, usually including not giving time for a claim, and always when further discussion of the lynch has merit and therefore the hammer being \"quick\" eliminates the possibility of this discussion.<br>\n<br>\nIt is quite clear that the Thor situation was different.  His outed fake claim was very close to 100% going to get him lynched that day.  I believe that the hammer was actually the CORRECT TOWN PLAY in that situation because any further discussion beyond Thor's lynch could 100% be done on the next day, and deferring it was actually beneficial to town because it was less info for scum for their NK.  The singular and only difference between having any discussion beyond the Thor lynch on Day 3 instead of Day 4 is that there would be one less town player on Day 4; but this is neither a reason for nor a reason against having the discussion on Day 4 instead of Day 3 since while one less town player means one less player who could inject town motivation into the discussion, it is also one less player to misidentify as town and thus making it that much easier to zero in on actual scum.  That issue being a wash, all we're left with is the deferral of the discussion being better for town because it gave scum less info for their NK.<br>\n<br>\nKarnos' quickhammer being the correct town play does not guarantee that he is town, by the way, but it certainly is not a reason to call him scummy.</div></div></div>", "time": "Thu Nov 17, 2016 4:08 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=68685&start=1625", "forum": "53", "thread": "68685"}

Feel much better now.<br>\n<br>\nAfter catching up, I can see that Penguin is scum here. No two ways about it, honestly. Scum killing Arona last night means that scum knew that Arona was a PR, so it could only be Penguin or Karnos. And given that Karnos was added after Arona died, the scum has to be Penguin. <br>\n<br>\nPenguin might say \"well maybe the scum just happened to kill arona by coincidence\" to which I would reply...no. You see, arona isn't the type of player who the scum would have targeted last night. Players like Math and bji are much more valuable to kill off since they're active and seem to have a good nose for scum overall. Arona tunneled me pretty much the entire game and scum would love nothing but town tunneling town, so no reason to kill him off other than they knew he was a PR.<br>\n<br>\nPlus, Thor wanted Karnos 24/7 and Karnos wanted Thor nearly 24/7. Someone made the point that you don't tunnel your encryptor two days in a row, which is valid. So just on that front, Karnos would be town.<br>\n<br>\nNot to mention that Penguin's arguments for scum!Karnos are hilariously bad. Like you seriously can't be arguing that what Karnos did yesterday was a scum quick-hammer. Like, no. Thor was obvious scum and pretty much everyone wanted him dead. Scum quick-hammers usually come with the caveat that no one was expecting it, but I'm pretty sure most people wouldn't be surprised that obvious scum!Thor would be hammered that quickly. This isn't even something you could argue. <br>\n<br>\nSo, whose the third partner?

As I said before, this suggests to me that there was little/no benefit in killing players from the \"actually playing the game\" category, which implies that the scum were not in any particular danger after Day 1. The scum kill of either Slandaar or evilpacman18 suggests to me that scum liked the Day 1 fighting between BBT/RC/me/Scripten.

}\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\">The biggest thing here is that if ironstove is town one or more of his reads are likely off. (For the moment I'm assuming ironstove is town and generally a meanie when he doesn't get his way.)  Generally the closer to lylo it gets the more push there is on someone with a right read. Not enough to get them lynched but enough to generate suspicion. Bji is what I would expect of a vote count of a townie whose reads who are more accurate than ironstoves. Someone has to push him and it has to be someone who would likely exist into the next day. Since bji and iron both have the same scum team likely only one of those is right. <br>\n<br>\nThis means likely only one of Nero and Penguin is scum and the other is town. Of the two, ironstove is much more adamant that Nero is scum. Both Nero and Penguin attacked bji in the mid 1000s range. However Penguin was the one who was caught deliberately lying about the state of the policy lynch <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8477806#p8477806\">1089</a> This would make bji the counter wagon for Thor and make him town.<br>\n<br>\nHowever scum with day talk active don't all hop on bji and with the encryptor found that just doesn't happen. Especially when Thor only had two votes <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8478333#p8478333\">1100</a>. Ironstove (assuming stove is town for the moment) seems to have the right idea in asking why bji was being lynched. <br>\n<br>\nThen Lowell hops on and seems to be the \"don't lynch the townie vote\" to try to give some legitimacy while pushing a mislynch in Saru. In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8478633#p8478633\">1105</a> He says the \"bji\" slot is basically town. Then why does Lowell have it in wiggle now. Not a single post addresses them in particular nor is their \"penguin\" read supported. This looks like more he can see where the wind is turning towards his buddy being lynched and wants to be on it \"early\".<br>\n<br>\nIn contrast Nero in post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8409471#p8409471\">92</a> looks like a genuine list of read mistakes. Scum generally \"spread out their fake reads\". So as if they are ever used they can justify scumreading one of the scum people. In this case it's just so bad it has to be town. Mainly Nero's RVS is way too antagonistic to be his scum game. He's almost bragging. <br>\n<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8008985#p8008985\" class=\"postlink\">http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.ph ... 5#p8008985</a><br>\nHere he just says you are lying. A lot less antagonistic. (Granted it's a replace in and not a direct copy). When Nero is town, he is antagonistic. Furthermore Nero in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8458545#p8458545\">796</a> wouldn't ask ironstove to stop role fishing. It would be too much scum interests here. <br>\n<br>\nFurthermore, Thor's vote at the start of day two was Karnos sitting. This as much as an ironstove+Karnos team makes sense to me in gut Thor and Karnos were at each others throats. I pressured him at first to see if he was replicating 1800 a bit but how Karnos has acted after the innocent child reveal makes it clear it's not 1800. He'd have been more \"panicky\" IMHO. Even in 1800 some of his posts had that \"urgency\" do it now bit. Either Thor gave him some meta tips or Karnos is probably town as much as that set up reminded me of 1800. I think I'm just biased to reading Karnos as scum. (With a large caveat of if Penguin Power flips town Then look at Karnos again with a vengeance.)<br>\n<br>\nThis also makes sense with myself, Saru, and Nero being the only ones off of Thor at the end of D2 (Assuming Penguin+Lowell+Thor) Saru would be AFK a lot toward the day end. I and Saru townread Thor (incorrectly) and Nero was the head of the bji wagon. If Nero was going to let Thor be no lynched it's a hell of a lot worse to post and not lynch at the end of the day. It should throw suspicion on him. Instead scum are \"pocketing\" Nero since someone else suspects Nero there is no reason to push there. <br>\n<br>\nNow take a look at 3.3 PenguinPower was on it early after not being on it D2. It's \"Damn it Thor. You fooled me.\"  This reeks of inevitability. Furthermore in combination with his setup spec post about a rolecop is highly unlikely. Scum if they had one would have used it also on FA to see if he was okay to let go and mislynch. Instead they roleblocked, claimed his role, and killed him. It shows that penguin power isn't investing thoughts into his theory when FA confirmed their was a roleblocker. <br>\n<br>\nNow furthermore, take a look at the opening after Thor was lynched. It was determined that I was the threat. In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8509588#p8509588\">1379</a> Lowell leaves off pushing Saru. Both he and I had the same explanation as to why we didn't vote Thor. However I was the more popular one. I intentionally revealed at L -2 because scum wouldn't want to be at the end of the wagon that was forming on me. There was an intentional plot to get me mislynched of which Thor would have suggested in night chat. Thor knows I am active crumber (see Wake's mafia) of which I have played with his scum meta (shame on me again for not recognizing it but kudos to him for altering it) and probably found it as soon as I replaced in and asked Lowell and Penguin Power to push. Between his inconsistency when Lowell should have been pushing Saru but instead pushes me means he is looking for an active mislynch and doesn't use his limited posts to actually hunt.<br>\n<br>\nNow examine the Arona kill. This one directly leads to Penguin Power OR Saru. However Penguin didn't even try to think about who killed the townies and why. Half of the game is who posts what as scumreads and the other half is who dies. If you aren't focusing on who dies and why there's something wrong.<br>\n<br>\nFA was a claimed PR and then GreyICE died. That's not indicative. What is indicative is that FA was roleblocked. It tells us that one of two things happened:<br>\nAt that point scum had no idea of the other PRs and roleblocked and attempted to kill him<br>\nOR<br>\nScum roleblocked FA and killed someone else and GreyICE either died as a result of being targeted or choosing that target. <br>\n<br>\nThere is also the possibility that Saru scum killed both GreyICE and Arona. Simply for suspecting him. Then the only potential partners for Saru in this case would be Penguin Power or ironstove. Karnos, bji, and Lowell wouldn't use their posts to townread Saru. (Note:Lowell's townread of Saru is unexplained push that.) Either way by lynching Power Penguin we take out a lot. Too much townreading would indicate a \"WHY AREN'T YOU DEAD?\" question. <br>\n<br>\nIt is also fishy as fuck that three people who are widely townread have the exact same scum team. (Karnos, bji, and stove) Note that Karnos again was floated around today. Similar to the bji argument Karnos is actually a threat because of where he is instinctively placing Lowell. The only way I see Karnos scum is with ironstove and in that case, we're fucked because ironstove could claim scum (like he did and I think I figured out why but I'm actually not saying why)</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: GIVE ME THE TLDR MATH NOW!!!!!!</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\">I only see certain combinations possible and in order of priority those are:<br>\nPenguin Power + Lowell<br>\nSaru + Penguin Power<br>\nSaru + ironstove<br>\nKarnos + ironstove<br>\n<br>\nHard town reading : bji, Nero<br>\nLight town read: ironstove<br>\nWaffle House: Karnos<br>\nLight scum read: Saru (by night actions only by posts he seems townie)<br>\nThe likely scum team: Penguin Power + Lowell</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\nIronstove, we agree on Penguin (or used to before your random unexplained Penguin is town bit).

The \"someone please hammer me\" dramatics could easily be fake, given that no one was going to jump ahead of Math and hammer anyone.  I'm still more sold on the Nero lynch than the Penguin lynch though.  Let me reiterate my case on Nero, so that it's very clear:<br>\n<br>\n- He started a wagon on what turned out to be a bad mislynch and which I think could have been identified as a bad mislynch at the time<br>\n- He is the only one to have explicitly called Mal scum, everyone else recognized it as a policy lynch.  To me this could easily be a slip, overplaying his hand.<br>\n- He started that wagon right after FA claimed.  The chances that FA was going to be lynched after claiming were low, anyone could have seen that, and Nero's first vote after the FA claim was the start of the Mal mislynch wagon, \"coincidentally\" timed right when scum needed a better wagon than the FA wagon.<br>\n- <div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: Thor/Nero interactions</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\"><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8426283#p8426283\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8426283#p8426283\" data-post-id=\"8426283\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 370</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=12326\">Thor665</a> wrote:</cite>Of what I've read?

What exactly was I to do yesterday anyways? First off I had a busy weekend, but also, both of my top 3 scum reads were up on the chopping block yesterday for pretty much the entire day. Did you want me to come in and yell \"woot\" or something? Math had ask for a list of my reads and I provided. And then I noted I'd prefer penguin but nero was ok too. Nero turned out town so now it's penguin that I definitely want. If you want to know the bug, it's the fact that obvious flailing scum got away yesterday. Heck, even iron said he only town read Penguin yesterday(after reading him as scum for years) because the flailing looked so \"authentic\", which is laughable. Shit like that annoys me.<br>\n<br>\nAnd as if Penguin's case on me is any good...<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol2.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"Laughing\"> His case on me is lurking, which then he should be calling Lowell my partner instead of Karnos. And then even his NK speculation doesn't hold up in logic, as I pointed out.<br>\n<br>\nYou know, it's funny. Penguin says Karnos and I are scum. That makes zero sense. Karnos and I got into a huge fight D1 and then I started tunneling Thor which then got Karnos calling both Thor and me scum, but then eventually Thor scum and me probably town. And then Thor started calling me town and Karnos scum. Like if you read all that, it makes zero sense that Karnos and I could have been scum with Thor. It's like a three-way fuckfest of bussing that would eventually lead to one of us getting lynched anyways, which is stupid since Karnos and I risked our encryptor big time. Especially doing such a thing on D1 and into D2 is like downright stupid.<br>\n<br>\nAnother thing: I'm pretty damn sure at this point Lowell is the partner. Besides the fact that Penguin pairs me with Karnos instead of Lowell, if you look through the ISOs of the people who can be scum and who still live, there are only 2 people in the game who never ever voted for Thor until he was confirmed scum, DING DING DING: Penguin and Lowell. Actually, they never even voted Tracer who Thor replaced. Even I voted Tracer at one point. Here's the kicker: Lowell got cold feet and never hammered Thor even though he promised he would, so he hadn't voted Thor even once in the game. Penguin only voted him when he was confirmed. There's a reason why they never touched him: they needed the day-talk. Can't lose that, now can they? Also, something I never noted until a quick re-read, penguin defended Thor pretty damn hard from Iron around the early-mid 900s. <br>\n<br>\nPlus, I can't forget the fact that Lowell attacking me earlier in the game was as scum as it gets. Like holy shit. His attacks were just a bunch of hypocritical attacks about lurking (when he was the #1 lurker and still is) and he avoided addressing my points about the mal wagon for ages. <br>\n<br>\nLike, honestly, I don't know how much more shit I have to point out to show scum!Penguin. I'll leave it up to Math, but remember Math, you had Penguin nailed yesterday and then you gave the benefit of the doubt to iron and then lynched town. That rings a bell in my head of our last game where you nailed me and then let me go as scum.

He's essentially making up teams to appease Math, like Lowell said. Next, for example, if Math says she wants to lynch bji, then Penguin will probably come up with some half-assed excuse to link bji with someone else to push the lynch. <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol2.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"Laughing\"> <br>\n<br>\nAlso, remember when he promised to tunnel Karnos today if Nero flipped town yesterday?

But in the extreme case that it is the latter, I want Penguin gone first. <br>\n<br>\nbji can make the judgement call on the partner tomorrow.

Then in the second post he re-votes Saru at the beginning of D2 still without any actual scum read.  And he also uses the phrase \"coming back to find some random rube dead\", which implies that he interprets the lynch of Mal as being without good explanation ... this seems disingenuous because he had voted Saru \"just to avoid a NL\", a day and a half before the deadline, which seems pretty arbitrary too.  This posturing of \"what are you all doing, my lynch choice was much better\" seems fake because he admitted that his lynch choice was just to avoid a NL long before such a reason was valid.<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8461145#p8461145\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8461145#p8461145\" data-post-id=\"8461145\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 864</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3450\">Lowell</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8460954#p8460954\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8460954#p8460954\" data-post-id=\"8460954\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 861</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=12326\">Thor665</a> wrote:</cite>\n<br>\nI couldn't describe the Saru case for the life of me - I think the theory is that I'm his partner or something, while being accused of both buddying him, and not defending him.

I'm very much here, aren't I? I will admit, the meat world is a bummer. <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\"><br>\n<br>\nSecondly, if you think Penguin's play means he rolled scum then how much he is actually playing makes no difference. Surely, you'd see that his activeness comes in the form of mainly one-liners that don't say much? iron sure seemed to think so. Compare with my posts that seem to have actual substance (and I'll admit, they're sparse in terms of quantity, but that's irrelevant to the point) that try to figure out motives of people (i.e. Thor and Karnos) rather than just baseless accusations (like Lowell and Penguin). Surprisingly (or not), Penguin's posts only get <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">slightly</div> bigger as he starts being suspected from yesterday. Substance from defense rather than from scum-hunting. Not very good substance, imo.<br>\n<br>\nLastly, I wouldn't be too excited about lynching Lowell today. Both Penguin and Lowell are scummy as fuck, and one of them has to go today, but Penguin seems to be better at escaping the noose compared to Lowell. He's done it two days in a row now. No offense to bji, but I don't see Penguin necessarily being lynched tomorrow. Instead, I predict more flailing and emotional BS that will let him win it all. I would not be a happy camper.

Scum or Town penguin would act the same way in this case, so it doesn't tell us anything new.</div></blockquote>\nIt doesn't matter if both scum or town Penguin would do such a thing, because it's about the timing. <br>\n<br>\nPenguin chose Lowell/Saru  as his team (and voted Lowell) only AFTER Math chose to want to lynch Lowell. The question is, why move away from a Saru/Karnos team at that time? One could say \"oh well maybe he saw your post and understood that a Karnos/Saru team would make no sense because of the bussing factor\" to which I would respond: then why was Penguin pushing a team who he had done no research about and also, why would he believe someone who he is scum reading to convince him of a different team? Maybe Karnos IS my partner, and I've successfully fooled Penguin into thinking otherwise?<br>\n<br>\nFurthermore, why would Penguin not instead say a Karnos/Lowell team since he promised to bus Karnos today? The answer is simple: he needs Karnos on his side tomorrow after he buses his partner. Penguin knows his partner is doomed today because everyone is saying Lowell is scum (otherwise he'd want to win the game right away by finishing me off like he was trying to earlier), and he can't defend him, so he has to lynch him. And he won't include Karnos in his scum list or push him because he needs Karnos on his side tomorrow. He puts me in as the partner because he knows I'll never lynch bji or Karnos, so there's no point in trying to appease me. It's really the only option he has left. I'm sure the original plan was to try and get Karnos or myself lynched today, but Lowell getting caught out ruined that. <br>\n<br>\nAnyways, Penguin's point about my \"inane drivel\" is hilarious. It's inane drivel because it's about him. Or maybe he needs an excuse not to respond to it, because he can't. <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\";)\" title=\"Wink\"><br>\n<br>\nI would be fine with a Lowell lynch today, but the one thing I would request is that Math/bji pick who they think the third partner is. The reason is because nothing will change tomorrow from today. Lowell will flip scum, Math will die, and we'll be back to where we were at the start of this day with Penguin and I calling each other scum. The difference will be that our IC will be dead, and they'll have no input on the lynch process. So it's better now that Math/bji agree on a third partner and they be lynched tomorrow straight away.

I can switch to another player if MathBlade asks (unless I think he is making a completely insane call, i.e. lynching me).<br>\n<br>\nFor that matter, even if MathBlade voted first (not sure how that would work when he wants to hammer), that doesn't inherently put him in control, town or scum players can still vote outside of his vote if they so choose.<br>\n<br>\nMy lack of caution is also trying to move the game forward. Lurking and waiting for someone else to make the first move would be easy, but it doesn't really help sort.

Someone killed the (at the time) only confirmed town in the game.  His defense of \"why would I do that, it looks so suspicious\" is WIFOM as whoa, and, obviously, not true since he's already survived a day and now on the verge of a scum win.

I suppose everyone does that from time to time, but for penguin it seems to be a pattern.  The reason I don't like these statements is that they feel a bit gamed.  I can see them being a setup where you can later say, \"but how can you believe I'm scum if you didn't do the [impossible thing] that I asked you to do to verify that I'm town?\", or even if it never gets to a specific exchange like that, town players may subconsciously feel that X has been proven just because they know that they didn't do the thing they were asked to do to prove X so out of a sense of 'fairness' they may be more likely to just believe 'X', as in, \"it's not fair of me to think that penguin is scum when he told me what to do to verify that he's town and I was too lazy to do it.\"<br>\n<br>\nAnother big example of that was the \"someone please hammer me\" dramatics at the end of day ... what was it?

Well, he must have known that no town player was going to hammer him with a confirmed IC having asked to hold the hammer and having been granted it, so what was the point of those dramatics?

I think the fact that town wins only 50% of games (I believe I read that stat somewhere, certainly it must be true because the game of Mafia is known to be well balanced) should indicate to everyone that it's kind of a crapshoot overall really.  Sometimes town gets lucky, sometimes not.<br>\n<br>\nIn this game we got some really lucky kills and mislynches.  Almost all the town power got taken out pretty systematically.  Arona was just a random shot in the dark.  Iron taking Math's bullet was lucky for us too.<br>\n<br>\nMy posts <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8585223#p8585223\">2178</a> to <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8585256#p8585256\">2183</a> were hedging my bets in case something happened that prevented Penguin dying.  In particular I was a little worried about Karnos and Penguin still having private talk in the neighborizer thread and thinking maybe they were going to work me over somehow.  After Math posted though I knew the game was really over so I had a little fun.  Thank you for taking my super smug \"I win\" comment well Penguin.<br>\n<br>\nI genuinely felt really badly for Penguin when he was at L-1 the day that Nero went.<br>\n<br>\nSince the dead thread is open, if someone from it wants to post the real link I would appreciate it.<br>\n<br>\nFinally - Math, I'm just lucky, not good.

I'm happy I tried to actually engage in a fruitful conversation with arona when he started suspecting me, and not just start tunneling/suspecting him, which is what I might usually do lmfao. Somewhat of an improvement, I guess. Thor's WK'ing of me was obvious from a mile away, especially given what happened to me in Mini 1823. Lowell was obvious as shit, and his lurking was like 10x worse than it usually is, and he has stated before that he absolutely hates being scum. So all that in aggregate was his doom in my eyes.<br>\n<br>\nbji did good with the bussing on Thor. I never bus (and probably never will) as scum, and I generally think it's a shitty idea, and so I started projecting my own (as I usually do) scum play onto others, which was silly. But in others way, bji did well, and I never really gave him any thought as a player until much later. So kudos.<br>\n<br>\nI thought Penguin was actually getting all emotional and shit as scum because I thought he was trying something similar to what I did in my last scum game against rb, where I was being so overly dramatic and emotional to the point where 2 town players thought \"no way scum plays like that, that's genuine town emotion\" and I didn't want a repeat of that on me. Plus, penguin's defense of Thor didn't help him. And him getting away from the lynch like twice was eating at me. And a whole bunch of other stuff.<br>\n<br>\nAnd, for the record Penguin, I never actually called you a \"herp derp\" in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8544533#p8544533\">2027</a>.

Pushing a strong wagon to lynch a buddy, or at least appearing to do so.<br>\n<br>\nWhite Knighting: Scum picking a town to defend, thanks to knowing who is town, and looking good when that defended town gets lynched and indeed flips town.<br>\n<br>\nPocketing: Reading someone as town in the hopes that helps them read you as town, can be done by scum or town.<br>\n<br>\nSnowing: white frozen water that falls from the sky during some cold days.
