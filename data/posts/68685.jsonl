Usually it's mafia, right? Also, adding such syntactical edits to a post indicates to me that the person kind of sat there for a moment and thought about what they were going to write because maybe they wanted to be careful about what they said. Normally this is expected behavior in a mafia game, however having this type of post come out so early feels a little off.<br><br>Anyway, the remaining posts from Alpaca's ISO don't feel scummy, and the reaction to the L-1 and threat of hammer were within the realm of acceptability. However behavior is still noted as it could be a scum maneuver/bussing, but for the time being it's lean scum to null. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8405438#p8405438\" class=\"postlink\">post 10</a>, AlpacaAlpaca wrote:</cite>is this scientifically proven</div></blockquote><br><br>A bit of an overreaction to argue that someone is a good lynch based on this post.

He's a bit of an enigma to me tbh.<br><br>I think iron is town. He seems to be driving the game's direction a great deal and attracting attention to himself from page like 2 in a way I wouldn't think scum would do. I think nero is town too for similar reasons (more driving the game than attracting attention like iron tho), moreso in the early game. I like lmk's posts too.<br><br>I agree with lowell that knight's vote on me seems opportunistic and I didn't really like his RVS presence--my vote on him in post 52 was actually serious because as far as I could tell he was trying to punish a legit attempt at scumhunting/moving the game out of RVS. alpaca's scumreads seemed really safe too but he elaborated on them at least and I don't have a problem with the rest of his content.<br><br>Everyone else hasn't posted much tbh.

Normally this wouldn't mean shit and still probably doesn't, however, if they were scum than they could be trying to disociate from each other right off the bat. Again, this could literally just be a random vote, but it could also be more then that (Illuminati confirmed). Now onto more concrete evidence, cuz I'm all about that. <br>1. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8407412#p8407412\">52</a> Arona votes me because \"We need to get out of rvs somehow\" but the post he quoted was me questioning Nero who, again, if they were all scum would make getting out of rvs a cover up for lynch the person questioning my scum partner. Also since this was still in RVS he could get away with it no questions asked. <br>2. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8409033#p8409033\">79</a> He also seems to be very ancy to lynch people as soon as possible, also possibly switching his vote from me to avoid suspicion later on.<br>3. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8409782#p8409782\">101</a> Still not sure wtf \"It stood out to me so I pursued that weird feeling\" means or why you would do it, but it seems like kind of a weird thing to do. Anyways, he mentions that Nero's joke wagon on Alpaca was with legit reasoning and should be taken seriously (Which btw I still don't agree with Nero's reasoning but whatever, I'll get back to that later). Again if they were scum partners they would try to back up eachothers arguments, even if they might not be the most legit.<br>4. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8409804#p8409804\">103</a> I guess this is an alright reason, but there are better reasons to lead a lynch wagon on someone.<br>5. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8409841#p8409841\">109</a> Protecting Nero<br>6. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8409861#p8409861\">114</a> Trying to say Nero's reason was serious, still don't think so, but this could again be trying to protect Nero or himself to get some heat off of him.<br>7. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8409884#p8409884\">127</a> Playing dumb?<br>8. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8409892#p8409892\">130</a> Iron saw what I did and now Arona is trying to defend himself while Nero is backing Arona up.<br>9. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8409935#p8409935\">140</a> Trying to validate Cmitc dropping his vote and then trying to turn on him to (possibly) dissociate Himself from Cmitc.<br>10. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8409966#p8409966\">145</a> Penguin possible target?<br>11. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8409990#p8409990\">149</a> Penguin sees Arona as scum as well<br>12. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8409999#p8409999\">151</a> Trying to play it off as a joke</div></div></div><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">TLDR of Aronagrundy scum read</span></span> Seems overly protective of Nero and Cmitc (possible scum partners) and is a little to obvious about it.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Evidence for Nerocain</span><br><div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: </b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display: none;\">Alright friendos finally we have the person inquiring my read list (which is fine and I actually had fun writing this) Nerocain.

Normally this wouldn't mean shit and still probably doesn't, however, if they were scum than they could be trying to disociate from each other right off the bat. Again, this could literally just be a random vote, but it could also be more then that (Illuminati confirmed).

Also since this was still in RVS he could get away with it no questions asked. <br>2. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8409033#p8409033\">79</a> He also seems to be very ancy to lynch people as soon as possible, also possibly switching his vote from me to avoid suspicion later on.<br>3. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8409782#p8409782\">101</a> Still not sure wtf \"It stood out to me so I pursued that weird feeling\" means or why you would do it, but it seems like kind of a weird thing to do. Anyways, he mentions that Nero's joke wagon on Alpaca was with legit reasoning and should be taken seriously (Which btw I still don't agree with Nero's reasoning but whatever, I'll get back to that later). Again if they were scum partners they would try to back up eachothers arguments, even if they might not be the most legit.<br>4. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8409804#p8409804\">103</a> I guess this is an alright reason, but there are better reasons to lead a lynch wagon on someone.<br>5. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8409841#p8409841\">109</a> Protecting Nero<br>6. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8409861#p8409861\">114</a> Trying to say Nero's reason was serious, still don't think so, but this could again be trying to protect Nero or himself to get some heat off of him.<br>7. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8409884#p8409884\">127</a> Playing dumb?<br>8. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8409892#p8409892\">130</a> Iron saw what I did and now Arona is trying to defend himself while Nero is backing Arona up.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">9. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8409935#p8409935\">140</a> Trying to validate Cmitc dropping his vote and then trying to turn on him to (possibly) dissociate Himself from Cmitc.</span><br>10. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8409966#p8409966\">145</a> Penguin possible target?<br>11. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8409990#p8409990\">149</a> Penguin sees Arona as scum as well<br>12. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8409999#p8409999\">151</a> Trying to play it off as a joke<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">TLDR of Aronagrundy scum read</span></span> <span class=\"noboldsig\">Seems overly protective of Nero and Cmitc</span> (possible scum partners) and is a little to obvious about it.<br></div></blockquote><br>(removed spoiler tags)<br><br>The bolded parts contradict each other.

But Nero pointed out iron's strange reversal in 159, which I tend to agree with. Why would iron laugh off someone who wanted to lynch alpaca if he himself had threatened to hammer. What could have changed?<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Null Lurkers</span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">malap</span>, no comment.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">saru</span>, likewise.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Null Newbs</span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">tracer</span>, espeically at the beginning, strikes me as a little too giddy. I've seen newbtown do this, but I've also seen scum do this as an attempt to be extra sociable and win friends.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">aron</span>. Similar, though he's more active. There's way too much \"let's talk about how RVS works, let's talk about the nature of jokes, let's talk about random unrelated thing\" for my liking, but I can't decide whether this is a confused newb or an intentional diverting scum.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">scums</span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">LmkGuy</span>.  In ISO, he looks terrible.  Of his 14 posts, the first 12 are pure fluff, with some specifically, actively trying to derail the game back to RVS or some other non-threatening null state.  157 in particular bothers me. He's trying to play the \"adult in the room\" angle a little to hard and looking to slide by unnoticed.  Find me a post where he attacks anyone, in any meaningful sense (that was rhetorical.  there is none) The best he can muster is a post where he half-assedly votes iron, then immediately equivocates with a \"hopefully this can get him playing a bit more seriously.\"  Look in the mirror, chief.  When the game gets serious, LmkGuy lurks.  When he can jump in with a quip or an upbeat emoticon, he pounces.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">knighty</span>.  I've mentioned some of this already.  His immediate and repeated defense of alpaca, starting in post 43, makes no sense, unless (a) he's protecting a buddy, or (b) he's trying to pocket an imperiled town on the verge of mislynch.  I suspect it's the latter, only because I doubt scumbuddies would defend each other THAT obviously, but in either scenario knighy is scum. When he's called on this, he backs down in post 90, saying he's \"just trying to point things out.\"  This is a weak retreat: he got caught and he's trying to get out of trouble. Even 251 reads overpolished and contrived.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">cmit</span>.  I'm put off by his refusal to list any reads, even as late as post 221. I don't think he's newbtown, I think he's newbscum playing the unfrozen caveman lawyer defense.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">penguin</span>.  Reads similar to LmkGuy, but less so.  He spent a lot of time early trying to make jokes and prove his winning personality.  He's improved, slightly, perhaps, but still seems to post only when there's a light moment he can pounce on.  I also don't like how he egged iron on to hammer alpaca early, only to more or less immediately say how the threat wasn't serious.<br><br>Lmk and knighty are my preferences.  No one seems to want to join knighty, so let's try this.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: LmkGuy</span>"}

As of now, you don't seem too scummy although I don't really know what to think at this point in the game, a lot of back and forth is going on between you, Arona, Cmitc, LmK, Penguin, and Iron. The problem I'm having is that all of these points whether against or with mine are good and are confusing lol. However, Tracer has kind of been AWOL and not mentioned in depth the many people she wants to vote, so right now Tracer isn't seeming scummy but also isn't being very useful and she might be trying to lay low until later on.

He pretty much coasted through RVS and stopped posting after voting Alpaca and saying he didn't like Penguins signature which, on that topic, he has a 7-0 as scum, maybe by doing exactly what he is doing rn (unless of course that WL is faked). He hasn't called V/LA so unless he's dead irl, he is probably waiting for people to forget about him, which we did. Possible scum waiting till the iron (not the player) is hot to strike.<br><br>Saru also hasn't said anything (besides page 1 RVS) until <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8411798#p8411798\">197</a> 8 pages later... As for his argument in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8417218#p8417218\">316</a> he is pretty much doing the same thing, his 7 posts except for a few were asking about Iron's code. So Saru has like 2 or 3 posts that had some substance but the thing about Tracer was already an idea at that point, so more like 1 or 2 substantial posts. Still null on Saru, really just hasn't said enough to give me an opinion either way.<br><br>Lowell has said barely anything including RVS which, to be fair, he was trying to help out but after that, he went silent except for a post calling my read on Arona \"opportunistic\" which, after I explained he went back to being silent. Lowell also hasn't really said a whole lot, like... less than anyone else... and with less content as well. So I am going to have to sit null on Lowell as well, have nothing to base an opinion off of.<br><br>Tracer, hmmm, I guess the main issue with her is the whole <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8409573#p8409573\">95</a> which everyone is already very familiar with. While she has posted a little more on who, there wasn't much why. So as I said and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8416985#p8416985\">311</a> I will be voting Tracer because she hasn't said anything explaining her choices and it is near the end of friday.

I remember when I got my first game as scum and a lot of his posts are the same kinds of thoughts/posts that I made during that scum game.

I'm not a long time veteran, but I have been playing here for some 9 months or so I think. When I first started, I played like this, and I got scum-read for it, and sometimes miss-lynched. After a few games I adjusted my play style to something that fits more into the general \"town meta\" of these boards, and didn't get miss-lynched as often, but it didn't actually make me win any more often as town. <br><br>I've come to realize that playing to the meta is really just playing to lose. At best you play the same as everyone else and maybe have a 50% chance to win, but anyone smart enough to play in a way that counters the general meta style will easily deceive you. I'm not going to play to lose. If it gets my lynched because my fellow town players are too dumb to think there might be a way to play other than standard meta, so be it- if that is the case is probably a loser game for town anyway, so my lynch won't change anything anyway. So that is where this defeatist attitude comes from. I am not going to change my play style, I am not going to give you your \"reads\" you want so bad, because it's BAD PLAY.<br><br>I mean, the most hilarious thing to me about the common meta here is that giving town reads is seen as A+++ good townie move, but any speculation at all about power roles is super bad scummy play. Except if someone is actually scum, they can discuss PR in scum chat, while town reads just give scum a guide on who to kill first, who to bus, etc. It's hilariously bad logic, but because it's become ingrained into the meta here everyone seems to think it's a good way to play."}

Pendulum swinging the other way too quickly, essentially.<br><br>I thought Knight was scummy because most of his latter posts before replace out was just a bunch of obvious observational comments that seemed like filler. This one sticks out in particular:<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8419767#p8419767\" class=\"postlink\">post 342</a>, Knighty Knight wrote:</cite>@Alpaca in response to <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8418181#p8418181\">329</a>.<br><br>Malpascp hasn't said anything since page 4 and what he did say wasn't very useful (fair enough given where we were at that time). He pretty much coasted through RVS and stopped posting after voting Alpaca and saying he didn't like Penguins signature which, on that topic, he has a 7-0 as scum, maybe by doing exactly what he is doing rn (unless of course that WL is faked). He hasn't called V/LA so unless he's dead irl, he is probably waiting for people to forget about him, which we did. Possible scum waiting till the iron (not the player) is hot to strike.<br><br>Saru also hasn't said anything (besides page 1 RVS) until <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8411798#p8411798\">197</a> 8 pages later... As for his argument in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8417218#p8417218\">316</a> he is pretty much doing the same thing, his 7 posts except for a few were asking about Iron's code. So Saru has like 2 or 3 posts that had some substance but the thing about Tracer was already an idea at that point, so more like 1 or 2 substantial posts. Still null on Saru, really just hasn't said enough to give me an opinion either way.<br><br>Lowell has said barely anything including RVS which, to be fair, he was trying to help out but after that, he went silent except for a post calling my read on Arona \"opportunistic\" which, after I explained he went back to being silent. Lowell also hasn't really said a whole lot, like... less than anyone else... and with less content as well. So I am going to have to sit null on Lowell as well, have nothing to base an opinion off of.<br><br>Tracer, hmmm, I guess the main issue with her is the whole <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8409573#p8409573\">95</a> which everyone is already very familiar with. While she has posted a little more on who, there wasn't much why. So as I said and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8416985#p8416985\">311</a> I will be voting Tracer because she hasn't said anything explaining her choices and it is near the end of friday. If she gives me a good reason to unvote her by midnight I might unvote.<br><br>But for now<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Tracer</span></div></blockquote><br>And everything before that was just Knight replying to people who had questions for him or made comments about him rather than any real contribution, and then he points out \"oh but I'm contributing more than others\" which was lol."}

So it mainly felt he was just making excuses for not wanting to do anything. It got even worse when he revealed that he read Iron as town and was therefore willing to vote with Iron, which seemed to go against his stated views and exception to those views. <br><br>But then Thor came in and he started to make similar or pretty much the same arguments that I was getting at, which made me feel a bit paranoid that he was buddying me or taking advantage. Karnos pointed out this possibility:<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8431436#p8431436\" class=\"postlink\">post 456</a>, karnos wrote:</cite>There is also a fair chance that between you and Saru one is actually town just being taken advantage of by the scum, but I'm fairly confident that at least one of you is scum <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\"></div></blockquote><br>And ever since then I've been somewhat paranoid about Thor. Notice how I don't really push Karnos after that. Usually my arguments are pretty emotional/bad as town, so when I see people agreeing with me, that worries me. It happened with Math buddying me onto Dierfire in 1800.<br><br>And basically, now, Thor is just harping on Karnos without much thought about anyone/anything else in the game. His ISO is basically all Karnos. Upon re-read, I don't think the arguments Thor and I were pushing were really all that great, and for him to be so gung-ho about it is strange. Like, yes, Karnos might have contradicted himself, but I don't really see it being the end all reason to call Karnos scum, as Thor does. <br><br>Also, just noticed: Thor said in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8427768#p8427768\">387</a> that the argument between Karnos and I was essentially white noise, so then why is Thor contributing to that white noise immediately afterwards?

He's got that whole 'indefinite V/La' thing going on. We are essentially voting this guy right now due to him being active on site, but not posting on the thread. Do we really gain anything from lynching him (unless he is scum ofc). We don't get any information on associates and he has no relevant reads that we can use based on his flip. For these reasons I am not really down to lynch him and would think that he either needs to be replaced or give us a time when he will be back.<br><br>The PR claim by Fire is interesting, and I guess we have to take him for his word for now. <br><br>I would put both Thor and Saru at null right now and I don't really feel confident in lynching either of them.<br><br>Lowell's latest post is weird. One of my friends who plays this told me to never lynch your town reads (unless you get information saying otherwise of course). This is something that I think is quite important and has helped me understand the game. <br><br>So if he has 'three or four' others he would want to lynch, that would make Saru at the very least a null or even town read. Someone said earlier in this game that voting for someone means you WANT to kill them and voting isn't just about pressuring. Your vote is your way of saying I want to kill you. With this in mind, Lowell is basically voting to kill null/town!Saru (in his eyes), even though he has \"scum\" reads. As town, would you not be better off identifying at LEAST one of your scum reads, posting reasoning and voting for them? We already got a time extension, so there is two days to convince people to join you and the wagons this game have taken off speed quickly, so there is no reason that a good, thought out post would not lead to a potential lynch.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Lowell</span>"}

He's been about tunneling Karnos since he first replaced in. It's almost as bad as Grey who had his head up his ass about wanting to lynch me. Let me ask you this: what do you think about Thor's play with Karnos and what do you think about both of them in general?<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8458959#p8458959\" class=\"postlink\">post 809</a>, Lowell wrote:</cite><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: saru</span><br><br>I don't have a strong case-based reason here, but I do have a strong feeling that the way that day ended was no accident.

But your feelings are unfounded and it's a bit strange how you went from calling me a \"lurker null read\"(which makes no sense) to voting me because my wagon dissipated. What happened to the 3 or 4 other lynches you mentioned in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8445942#p8445942\">681</a>. Why not talk about them, or do they not exist? <br><br>Either you're ignoring the fact that I had claimed when people started to unvote(which would imply they believed the claim or felt comfortable with it) or you're ignoring the fact that votes shifted to malp quickly because a) he was an easy target to wagon on because b) there was almost no time left in the day, even after an extension and because c) he wasn't around to defend himself. Neither would suggest my wagon falling apart because I'm scum, as you seem to imply. In fact, IME, most scum wagons in the early-game fall apart before a claim, rather than after. Scum don't want to be pinned into a claim so early in the game and so most scum partners would try to derail it halfway through, even subtly. Basically no one in the game was trying to actively or subtly derail my wagon D1. <br><br>Also, this is definitely not the town!Lowell I remember from our last game together. You've lurked 24/7(this matches up slightly), have less posts than some replacements, and have done generally nothing, even going as far as to admit to not having a case for your vote, even though you imply you have others you want to lynch more than myself. There's no reason for me to think you're town here. But if you are, thanks for being a team player lmfao. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif\" alt=\":roll:\" title=\"Rolling Eyes\"><br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Thor665</span> but this can go to Lowell if he keeps up the shit play."}

It's a mix between the tunneling and the feeling that I'm being buddied. Hell, you say it yourself, that Thor seems to be \"quiet as to how he reads you at the moment\" and \"almost dismissive...about your case on him\" which is basically how I feel, hence why I feel I'm being buddied. Grey was a different story in that he was tunneling me like an idiot, but just tunneling itself isn't enough for me to scum read him.

So it mainly felt he was just making excuses for not wanting to do anything. It got even worse when he revealed that he read Iron as town and was therefore willing to vote with Iron, which seemed to go against his stated views and exception to those views. <br><br>But then Thor came in and he started to make similar or pretty much the same arguments that I was getting at, which made me feel a bit paranoid that he was buddying me or taking advantage. Karnos pointed out this possibility:<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8431436#p8431436\" class=\"postlink\">post 456</a>, karnos wrote:</cite>There is also a fair chance that between you and Saru one is actually town just being taken advantage of by the scum, but I'm fairly confident that at least one of you is scum <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\"></div></blockquote><br>And ever since then I've been somewhat paranoid about Thor. Notice how I don't really push Karnos after that. Usually my arguments are pretty emotional/bad as town, so when I see people agreeing with me, that worries me. It happened with Math buddying me onto Dierfire in 1800.<br><br>And basically, now, Thor is just harping on Karnos without much thought about anyone/anything else in the game. His ISO is basically all Karnos.[b] Upon re-read, I don't think the arguments Thor and I were pushing were really all that great, and for him to be so gung-ho about it is strange. Like, yes, Karnos might have contradicted himself, but I don't really see it being the end all reason to call Karnos scum, as Thor does. <br><br>Also, just noticed: Thor said in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8427768#p8427768\">387</a> that the argument between Karnos and I was essentially white noise, so then why is Thor contributing to that white noise immediately afterwards?

Literally the same page Nero (sort of) calls out lmk for his interaction with alpaca, lmk posts this.  Since lmk complains there's no case on him, here it is again.  He lurks, then when he does post he refuses to take a stand on anything he can't immediately back away from.  This reads as coaching, trying to coax alpaca back into the game now that his name is mentioned again.

Mostly all I got was buyer's remorse, but I do have a few clear(ish) thoughts:<br><br>- The day 1 lynch was piss-poor in my opinion.  For all of the accusations flying around of players not basing their reads on demonstrably credible reasoning, the idea of lynching a lurker on Day 1 because \"he appears to be active elsewhere on the site\" is utterly ridiculous.  I mean how is not playing the game any more scum than it is town?  Would scum really be so obvious as to avoid play like that?  Bad bad wagon.  So I will have to analyze that wagon and how it went down a little more clearly on a second more focused read, because I think I might be able to get some good reads from that.<br><br>- I tend to look for subtle interactions more than obvious ones.  Sure some people have put forth dumb theories or sometimes have not been entirely self-consistent in their reasoning, but that stuff is just as likely to happen for town as for scum.  I don't find the argument that \"X must be scum because I defeated X's position on Y\" particularly compelling. Regarding subtle stuff, I find aronagrundy's posts and votes to repeatedly tingle my spidey-senses, I feel like there is alot of subtle maneuvering there.  I'll provide more detail later in this post.<br><br>- ironstove is high on my list of interesting persons.  I appreciate how he's tried to drive wagons repeatedly and all of them seemed well justified to me.<br><br>- I think Knighty Knight was lying about not having played before.  His grasp of the game lingo was too strong for someone who hasn't played before.  He was replaced by someone who has claimed a power role.  I would tend to believe that Knightly Knight was trying to feign newbishness as a means of providing him some \"space to work\" with his PR, so that he could say and do seemingly dumb things that had a PR purpose, without being suspected of having a PR.  For this reason, and others (mostly related to Fire Assassin's posts on the PR subject themselves), I believe that Fire Assassin is a confirmed town PR.<br><br>I have two strong town reads at the moment: Fire Assassin, and ironstove.  I already explained why above.<br><br>I have one really strong scum read: aronagrundy.  My reasoning here, is twofold: I generally don't like the tone of his posts, they feel a bit slimy, he feels like he is just trying to prod town along to making mislynches, more than actually scum hunting.  And the quantity and timing, just seems carefully planned, he pops up just enough to guide or participate in bad wagons.<br><br>The second issue I have with aranogrundy is his voting record.  It's really bad.<br><br>He spends most of post-RVS Day 1 voting Knighty Knight, whom I feel never really deserved a vote, and then jumps over to malpascp when it's clear that that wagon has momentum, happy to stay on that terrible wagon with the only two players he had previously voted for (Fire Assassin and PenguinPower).  This feels very opportunistic to me.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Aronagrundy</span>"}

I actually didn't see it until I just went into your ISO.

It was a reply to the question that you're claiming I was trying to dodge or something stupid. <br><br>Lastly, you really are making a superficial argument against me at this point. You're looking at action, but not motivation. There's no scum motivation for me to ignore your question one time and then answer it when you ask again. If anything, that only makes me look bad. You think that I think I can get away with straight up not responding to people or something? You make it sound like you asked me about Thor like 10 million times before I responded, when really, it was only twice. There's no dodging or avoiding anything there, otherwise, I'd just keep doing it, which, again, makes no sense from any perspective."}

You say the Karnos wagon wasn't going to last, but you can't prove that. I had no reason to move off of Karnos as scum. His wagon was going fine, and one person coming in (who never questioned the wagon btw) questioning me about my ISO being full of Karnos wouldn't be enough to make me stop as scum. No pressure existed, so you can stop acting like it did, thanks.<br><br>Also, I hopped off the FA wagon because he started actually doing something with the slot he replaced into. Notice that I voted for Knight for his lacking posts, which FA made up for. How scummy of me to hop off the wagon of a slot which starts doing the opposite of what I scum read it for! :O<br><br>I also did not change my reason on the Thor push. If I knew it wouldn't hold up from D1 (as you say), I would have conveniently dropped it D1 and replaced it with something else, which is not what happened. I had a two part reason for not feeling good about Thor from D1. I would have gotten rid of the \"copying\" argument much earlier, according to your logic. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>aronagrundy wrote:</cite>Also yes I think that ignoring people can be a valid strategy for scum because scum benefits from not providing too much information, and sometimes people don't follow up on questions or they're just afterthoughts.

I am under no illusion that ironstove actually believed that he was hammering FA.  His post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8443054#p8443054\">652</a> makes it pretty clear that he was just reaction testing FA.

Nero Cain prefers to vote against Mal though.  This is actually interesting.  Post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8446498#p8446498\">689</a> Nero Cain says \"so scum is voting Thor. Does this mean Saru is a scumbuddy or he's voting off the wagon to manipulate us onto the Saru wagon?\".  Who was voting Thor?  Saru, FA, and ironstove.  Saying \"Does this mean Saru is a scumbuddy\" means that Nero must have been referring to one or both of the other two as scum.  If Nero thought that FA was scum presumably he'd be focused on hammering him instead of pushing a new wagon.  That leaves ironstove.  This is consistent with his earlier postings wrt ironstove.  But why is Nero Cain pushing for a wagon on Mal if he believes that ironstove is scum?<br><br>FA is second on the mal wagon in post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8446902#p8446902\">695</a>.

This looks bad to me.  Sheeping didn't fit into any part of Thor's approach up to this point.  I felt like he was being methodical and consistent previously and then all of a sudden is happy to be on a wagon that makes no sense?  Highly suspect.<br><br>Nero Cain post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8447742#p8447742\">702</a> makes it very clear that ironstove was the scum he was referring to being on the Thor wagon.<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8447890#p8447890\">703</a> to <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8447915#p8447915\">707</a> ironstove bounces from lowell to Mal, becoming fourth on the Mal wagon.  It seems like he does it in response to interaction with Nero Cain, who thinks iron is scum.  Is ironstove joining the Mal wagon just to test Nero Cain's response to having his top scum read join his wagon?  I can't see any other reason given by ironstove for the vote.  Nero Cain doesn't really respond though and doesn't seem to care that his strongest scum read has joined his wagon.  This is weird.<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8448171#p8448171\">710</a> aronagrundy pops in and doesn't give much substance and happily joins the Mal wagon, putting Mal at L-3, despite having no good reason to.

BUT THEN post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8450132#p8450132\">767</a> he totally does a 180 and votes him to L-2.<br><br>Soon thereafter ironstove does his own 180 and puts Mal on L-1.  WTF is going on here?<br><br>Nero's post immediately after that claims that \"Mal prob filps scum here.  I tend to think that his buddies are in LMK, PP, and Stove.\"  If Nero is scum he would have known that Mal is town, so he'd be weakening his own case against Ironstove by this post, suggesting he'd rather target LMK or PP for the next mislynch in day 2.<br><br>Thor comes on strong after that to push the Mal wagon.  He's pushing what was a mislynch at L-1.  I don't like this.<br><br>GreyICE hammers.  We know GreyICE was town so  I will trust that his reasoning really was policy lynch.  I don't agree with that, but there it is.<br><br><br>OK so ... out of all of this, here are my conclusions:<br><br>- I don't know why Nero would prefer a Mal lynch over Ironstove, or why Nero moved his vote off of Ironstove and onto Mal.  This is really bad.<br>- I don't know why Nero completely ignored the fact that his top scum read had joined his wagon on Mal<br>- LmkGuy, kamos, and GreyICE were the only players I saw really trying to put the brakes on the mad Mal wagon<br>- Thor looks opportunistic and bad in all of this<br>- ironstove confuses me, his overall contributions have been very towny to me but his presence on this wagon and the way it went down at the end are very troubling<br><br>So this analysis lets me further refine my reads.<br><br>Town: Fire Assassin<br>Lean Town: ironstove, LmkGuy, Kamos<br>Lean Scum: Nero Cain<br>Scum: Thor<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Thor</span>"}

Why not talk about them, or do they not exist? <br><br>Either you're ignoring the fact that I had claimed when people started to unvote(which would imply they believed the claim or felt comfortable with it) or you're ignoring the fact that votes shifted to malp quickly because a) he was an easy target to wagon on because b) there was almost no time left in the day, even after an extension and because c) he wasn't around to defend himself. Neither would suggest my wagon falling apart because I'm scum, as you seem to imply. In fact, IME, most scum wagons in the early-game fall apart before a claim, rather than after. Scum don't want to be pinned into a claim so early in the game and so most scum partners would try to derail it halfway through, even subtly. Basically no one in the game was trying to actively or subtly derail my wagon D1.</div></blockquote><br>I saw the claim, but I don't understand what you think it means.  You're saying your VT claim is so airtight that everyone just up and decided you must be town?  To your points, I would say: (a) you were an even EASIER wagon since you were almost dead and claimed VT, (b) why move from a VT claim to an unknown lurker at the last minute?, and (c) who would have it in their interest to move to an unknown lurker over you (who can defend himself, as you say) at the last minute if you're town?<br><br>Basically, I don't see how the following narrative: \"I almost got lynched right at deadline, claimed VT, then a powerwagon instantly formed on a lurker who can't defend himself\" absolves you."}

Of course it's possible, but this is a game of odds and those odds don't seem good to me.<br><br>So now, I had to ask myself, who are the most likely scum drivers or participants of that wagon?<br><br>The wagon had Nero Cain, Fire Assassin, Thor, aronagrundy, karnos, ironstove, and GreyICE.<br><br>GreyICE is out because already dead town.<br>ironstove is one of my top town reads for other reasons that I have already stated, so I'm not going to focus on him when I have better choices.<br>karnos, same.<br>aronagrundy would be my third choice for scum, and I would vote him absent other choices.  I tried to push a little on aronagrundy but I felt like his reasoning in response did seem sincere, and additionally, he doesn't post a lot so it's easy to lose focus on him when other people I am interested in are posting more.  That being said, not posting alot should not be a free pass to coasting through so I'd still be happy to pressure aronagrundy if anyone else in this game would bother to try with me.<br>Thor - I didn't like his unexplained sheep vote and I don't feel like any of the reasons he gave for voting Mal were even remotely as well explained as any of his other reasons for vfoting any of the other people he's voted.  So he's a strong candidate for scum on this wagon from my perspective.<br>Fire Assassin I have as a town read because of the claim and the way that the NK went down, so I'm not focusing on him while other better candidates are present.<br>Nero Cain started the wagon, which I didn't like, and I really didn't like his defenses, which also involved outright misrepresentations of other players' reasons for being on that wagon, which I elaborated on in post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8477806#p8477806\">1089</a>.<br><br>I'd lynch one of { Thor, Nero Cain, aronagrundy } today.<br><br>Until and unless I do a deep re-examination of the game, I don't see my stance changing there.

The whole concept seemed to piss Grey off pretty well, I suspect he wasn't thinking \"awesome, this foolish scum has revealed himself by a brain dead V/LA ploy\", because, my god, who actually believes that scum would employ that technique?

And LMK did defend you by trying to derail your wagon by casting a naked vote for someone with no chance of being lynched at deadline (me).  I made this point when casting the vote.  Honestly you're not even trying at this point.  The main point is you had a wagon with time running out, you claimed VT, which miraculously saved you and strung up a lurker.  Even the way you were talking \"well, I guess I'm about to die\" and all that stuff looks in hindsight like a total put-on."}

So I guess we already have just about everyone who is going to contribute in here already.<br><br>So in the interest of trying to get things moving forward, let's step back and take a look at this game.  Thor and myself are the two hottest wagons at the moment.  And yet there are some players who are piddling around with wagons that clearly aren't going anywhere.  I present to you: LmkGuy, Lowell, and Saru.<br><br>LmkGuy has a very bland ISO.  One thing that caught my eye was post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8449830#p8449830\">741</a> where he said \"Maybe everyone should post a few reason why they want a certain person lynched\", but then he doesn't actually follow through and provide \"a few reason\" why he wants anyone lynched.  This is either very lazy scumhunting, or is an attempt to just kind of coast while looking like he is trying to scumhunt.  I mean if you think that everyone posting some concise reasons for a vote is needed to get clarity in the game, why wouldn't you start out by doing it yourself?  Unless you actually didn't care or didn't believe what you were saying?<br><br>That being said, his whole game reads as just lazy so it could just be that.  Plus he's going to be replaced so I'd much rather see what his replacement says that relying on his ISO for evaluating his slot at this point.<br><br>Lowell has never voted anyone that I have a scum read on, while at the same time town reading me at every opportunity.  He's so not present that he's been slipping under my radar but on re-read of his ISO and paying closer attention to his votes, I am getting a pretty icky feeling about him.  He's also not given a single opinion about the Thor wagon or my wagon.  Lowell - if you had to choose between me and Thor, who would you vote and why?<br><br>Saru is completely hung up on his fight with Lowell and is basically not interacting with the rest of the game, except to occasionally defend himself whenever anyone such as aronagrundy mentions him.  If I recall he spent quite a bit of his time on Day 1 in a tit-for-tat with karnos.  Saru -- do you have any plans to scumhunt any further than the person you happen to be in a fight with at the moment?<br><br>PEdit - Yes Thor I mislynched you in our only other game together.  But I've already stated numerous times that I'm not going to let other games influence my decision making in this game.  Unless and until I read every game you've ever played, and can evaluate all of your play instead of one example, I'm not going to look at just one example of your play and try to extrapolate anything from that.  And besides, if you are a skilled player, and I believe you are, then your scum play should look just like your town play, and you do look pretty similar in this game as you did in the other.  But of course, I'm not even factoring that into my case against you.  But keep squirming, it's fun to watch ..."}

And LMK did defend you by trying to derail your wagon by casting a naked vote for someone with no chance of being lynched at deadline (me).  I made this point when casting the vote.  Honestly you're not even trying at this point.  The main point is you had a wagon with time running out, you claimed VT, which miraculously saved you and strung up a lurker.  Even the way you were talking \"well, I guess I'm about to die\" and all that stuff looks in hindsight like a total put-on.</div></blockquote><br>Your first sentence made zero sense. You're the one who's definitely not even trying anymore. But of course, you seem to love the pot calling the kettle black tactic. You did the same thing with calling me a lurker on D1 where you had like ten posts or something. You also dodged the point (again) about why my scum partners didn't come to my defense in the first place, instead of letting me even get to the claim stage. <br><br>Secondly, your vote on LMK doesn't match up at all with your feelings about me or the people who switched to the malp wagon. Not one bit. LMK DIDN'T defend me at all. Not in words, and not in vote, and you know this. The first person to even suggest the malp wagon was in fact Nero. LMK has had zero influence in that regard. You just needed to vote a player who was inactive to make sure you didn't get into conflict with anyone, and LMK was that guy. Everyone who was ACTUALLY on the malp wagon were either your buddies or people who were too vocal for you to have had challenged at the time. <br><br>Honestly, I feel like saying so much more but your arguments are so objectively bad and I just don't think I can keep arguing with such obvious scum. It's a real shame that we only have a couple of hours left, but I would implore people to lynch Lowell ASAP.

Only Arona and FA talked. FA initially didn't want to talk to Arona because he didn't townread Arona.  That changed because he didn't think the mafia had an RB and a neighborizer.  FA recommended adding Nero to the neighborhood, but later told Arona to add me.  <br><br>Arona and I discussed a few things (before the Thor flip we both agreed scum within Saru/Lowell and adding karnos).  This was all pre-Thor's flip.  When karnos was added, Arona was dead and only karnos and I could discuss things. He made an argument for your lynch (which is basically what he has said in this thread), made a post about how he had just read the wiki and neither of us were conf!town (one reason why I scum read him), and now we are just antagonizing each other.<br><br>Again...to be clear...FA died before karnos or I were added to the neighborhood."}

These are not scum motivated posts, and not posts that feel like a scum!karnos would make. <br><br>Then regarding saru, the posts I highlighted above make him look relatively scummy until : <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8437042#p8437042\">515</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8437107#p8437107\">519</a>, and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8443235#p8443235\">662</a>.<br><br>These posts are super towny, at least I thought up until the point that thor flipped encryptor. I imagine it's possible that Saru received some coaching from daychat to formulate the posts I wrote above. I say this because Saru has remained extremely inconsistent. He says he's left handed but still writes with his right. <br><br>like <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8443420#p8443420\">673</a>, he indicates that KnightyKnight is a scum read despite the fact that knight's vote is parked on the Thor slot. Interesting that Saru says in 662 'I am almost certain that Thor is scum' and in the following post tries to FOS someone who is voting someone who voting a slot whom 'he is almost certain is scum'. Clearly a major slip here. <br><br>Major actions on why nero/saru are most likely scum this game:<br><br>1. Nero pushing the heavy mal lynch, off of his partners saru and thor. Yet he knows this is a slot that can't claim, we're lynching this slot for inactivity... Incredibly scummy wagon, yet he calls out karnos as scummy for voting thor with no chance for town to discuss even though we're discussing right now, so what's the issue? My belief is that this was because thor/saru are the PRs, like thor is obviously encryptor, but saru has to be roleblocker at this point.<br><br>Nero also made <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8450284#p8450284\">772</a> which I would say clears penguin if nero flips scum, and implicates saru further. <br><br>2. Saru indicating <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8443235#p8443235\">662</a> which was made sense up until it came time to stand by his words, he parked his vote on lowel, who was neither knightyknight, or thor, when thor was in hammer range. I.e. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8498003#p8498003\">1260</a> he says giving intent to hammer and he returns and doesn't hammer. Thor follows in with a scummy tracker claim and then saru makes this disgusting post in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8508149#p8508149\">1339</a> trying to pin the nl on lowell, when his inaction caused the result as well, using the tracker claim as an excuse LOL.<br><br>Now we're here in D4, nero is trying to ML karnos saying the quickhammer killed town discussion and disallowed scum hunting. This is a bullshit excuse and those of you that are buying it are fools because quick hammering in that situation DOES NOTHING but stop THOR WHO HAS AVOIDED BEING THE LYNCH FOR 2 DAYS IN A ROW FROM GETTING AWAY A 3RD DAY. AND WE CAN EASILY SCUM HUNT THE FOLLOWING DAY. <br><br>In all seriousness, please explain to me 1 reason why quick hammering there is so bad? What could we have done then that we can't do today? NOTHING.<br><br>So I say lynch between {saru, nero}, if either one flips town, we need to reassess the {lowell, penguin} pool, but at this point, town are in {bji, karnos, math}"}

I wasn't, I tried to fight the lynch, but it was the only lynch happening so my thought process was \"I would rather mislynch the cop so I can build a case tomorrow on nero, than have a no lynch and have no information to go on the following day\", so I bit. <br><br>Nero refused karnos' suggestion on mal 'Why don't you just let him live today and see if he replaces out? You refused to lynch the tracer slot (Who is now thor, surprise surprise?) for being AFK, yet you want to lynch mal rather than letting him veg till he's replaced and without  a chance to claim?'<br><br>To this nero said mal was active in other games, but still couldn't justify why it was better to lynch than let the guy veg another day and be replaced.

I wasn't town reading him, I just wanted to phrase my question in a way that he might give a useful response. But maybe Penguin thought I was, and he knew that his partner was among nero:saru pool, which meant we could lynch both, deal with taking one miss lynch, and then possibly lynch him, so he panicked and decided to try to push a wagon on me. It feels like a stretch because it is: I really thought penguin could be town this game, I just see zero town incentive to turn this day into a 1vs1 lynch situation when there were more likely scum to pick from.<br><br>Between nero and saru, which one would be penguin's partner?"}

I can scream someone is scummy all day long, but if I don't put a vote on that person then it's all empty words.</div></blockquote><br><br>I am getting a little lost in what the argument is about here.  It was my impression that you are trying to make points about why Karnos' hammer of Thor made no sense, and was trying to use the fact that Karnos never voted for Thor day 1 and otherwise mostly had his vote on Saru as evidence for this.  The point I am trying to make is that Karnos may have had his vote mostly on Saru but he expressed tremendous interest in Thor and called him scum numerous times along with Saru, so to me, a Karnos hammer of Thor is not inconsistent with his position.  And when I say that your argument is a misrep, it's because Karnos' position was so clear and his vote on Thor so wells supported by his previous postings, that to suggest otherwise doesn't seem like it can have an innocent motivation.<br><br>Also I think that it's patently false to say that if you don't vote someone, then all of your statements about them are just empty words.  There were 3 scum on Day 1 and one can't vote all three at once so does that mean that on day 1 it's not possible to have more than one scum read?  And that it's not possible to make any more progress towards winning the game than to place a vote on one scum?  Where \"progress\" here means placing suspicion on the one suspected scum you happen to be voting?   Obviously not, therefore your statement is false.<br><br>Finally, let's assume that what you say is true, and that only votes count.  Then Karnos redeemed himself by voting Thor didn't he?  Because he finally did something beyond \"empty words\" with regards to Thor?<br><br>By saying that his repeated talking about and question of Thor and also outright calling Thor scum, but not voting him, was scummy, and also saying that his actual vote of Thor was scummy, you are basically in retrospect making Karnos' scumminess a truism; he was scummy if he did vote Thor, and scummy if he didn't, according to your position.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>PenguinPower wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8442392#p8442392\" class=\"postlink\">post 608</a>, karnos wrote:</cite>Town: it's a scum claim to quick hammer, don't do it.</div></blockquote><br><br>Nice scum claim quickhammering Thor.</div></blockquote><br><br>You see, this also feels misreppy to me.  The Thor hammer was not a traditional quickhammer, so here you are misrepresenting the hammer to make it fit your position against Karnos.<br><br>I think most people would recognize, and those who don't need some education, that a quickhammer is a hammer that is done without giving time for town to discuss the now very imminent lynch, usually including not giving time for a claim, and always when further discussion of the lynch has merit and therefore the hammer being \"quick\" eliminates the possibility of this discussion.<br><br>It is quite clear that the Thor situation was different.  His outed fake claim was very close to 100% going to get him lynched that day.  I believe that the hammer was actually the CORRECT TOWN PLAY in that situation because any further discussion beyond Thor's lynch could 100% be done on the next day, and deferring it was actually beneficial to town because it was less info for scum for their NK.  The singular and only difference between having any discussion beyond the Thor lynch on Day 3 instead of Day 4 is that there would be one less town player on Day 4; but this is neither a reason for nor a reason against having the discussion on Day 4 instead of Day 3 since while one less town player means one less player who could inject town motivation into the discussion, it is also one less player to misidentify as town and thus making it that much easier to zero in on actual scum.  That issue being a wash, all we're left with is the deferral of the discussion being better for town because it gave scum less info for their NK.<br><br>Karnos' quickhammer being the correct town play does not guarantee that he is town, by the way, but it certainly is not a reason to call him scummy.</div></div></div>"}

Had a cold sweat and nearly puked a couple of times. Feel much better now.<br><br>After catching up, I can see that Penguin is scum here. No two ways about it, honestly. Scum killing Arona last night means that scum knew that Arona was a PR, so it could only be Penguin or Karnos. And given that Karnos was added after Arona died, the scum has to be Penguin. <br><br>Penguin might say \"well maybe the scum just happened to kill arona by coincidence\" to which I would reply...no. You see, arona isn't the type of player who the scum would have targeted last night. Players like Math and bji are much more valuable to kill off since they're active and seem to have a good nose for scum overall. Arona tunneled me pretty much the entire game and scum would love nothing but town tunneling town, so no reason to kill him off other than they knew he was a PR.<br><br>Plus, Thor wanted Karnos 24/7 and Karnos wanted Thor nearly 24/7. Someone made the point that you don't tunnel your encryptor two days in a row, which is valid. So just on that front, Karnos would be town.<br><br>Not to mention that Penguin's arguments for scum!Karnos are hilariously bad. Like you seriously can't be arguing that what Karnos did yesterday was a scum quick-hammer. Like, no. Thor was obvious scum and pretty much everyone wanted him dead. Scum quick-hammers usually come with the caveat that no one was expecting it, but I'm pretty sure most people wouldn't be surprised that obvious scum!Thor would be hammered that quickly. This isn't even something you could argue. <br><br>So, whose the third partner?

The scum kill of either Slandaar or evilpacman18 suggests to me that scum liked the Day 1 fighting between BBT/RC/me/Scripten. Of all the players in that group, there are two who have mostly escaped scum reads during Day 1: BBT and me. I'm not scum, so the only interesting person in the category of \"players who played hard day 1 but didn't get many scum reads\" is BBT.<br><br>Therefore, I categorize my likely scum as BBT, and one or more of the lurkers.\"<br><br>I was scum reading the lurkers for REASONS, <span class=\"noboldsig\">NOT BECAUSE THEY WERE LURKERS</span>.<br><br>AND, BBT WAS NOT EVEN IN THAT CATEGORY!<br><br>Furthermore, your vote on Mal had the unique characteristic of choosing the player with the least interaction with anyone, making it the optimal scum mislynch.

(For the moment I'm assuming ironstove is town and generally a meanie when he doesn't get his way.)  Generally the closer to lylo it gets the more push there is on someone with a right read. Not enough to get them lynched but enough to generate suspicion. Bji is what I would expect of a vote count of a townie whose reads who are more accurate than ironstoves. Someone has to push him and it has to be someone who would likely exist into the next day. Since bji and iron both have the same scum team likely only one of those is right. <br><br>This means likely only one of Nero and Penguin is scum and the other is town. Of the two, ironstove is much more adamant that Nero is scum. Both Nero and Penguin attacked bji in the mid 1000s range. However Penguin was the one who was caught deliberately lying about the state of the policy lynch <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8477806#p8477806\">1089</a> This would make bji the counter wagon for Thor and make him town.<br><br>However scum with day talk active don't all hop on bji and with the encryptor found that just doesn't happen. Especially when Thor only had two votes <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8478333#p8478333\">1100</a>. Ironstove (assuming stove is town for the moment) seems to have the right idea in asking why bji was being lynched. <br><br>Then Lowell hops on and seems to be the \"don't lynch the townie vote\" to try to give some legitimacy while pushing a mislynch in Saru. In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8478633#p8478633\">1105</a> He says the \"bji\" slot is basically town. Then why does Lowell have it in wiggle now. Not a single post addresses them in particular nor is their \"penguin\" read supported. This looks like more he can see where the wind is turning towards his buddy being lynched and wants to be on it \"early\".<br><br>In contrast Nero in post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8409471#p8409471\">92</a> looks like a genuine list of read mistakes. Scum generally \"spread out their fake reads\". So as if they are ever used they can justify scumreading one of the scum people. In this case it's just so bad it has to be town. Mainly Nero's RVS is way too antagonistic to be his scum game. He's almost bragging. <br><!-- l --><a class=\"postlink-local\" href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8008985#p8008985\">viewtopic.php?p=8008985#p8008985</a><!-- l --><br>Here he just says you are lying. A lot less antagonistic. (Granted it's a replace in and not a direct copy). When Nero is town, he is antagonistic. Furthermore Nero in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8458545#p8458545\">796</a> wouldn't ask ironstove to stop role fishing. It would be too much scum interests here. <br><br>Furthermore, Thor's vote at the start of day two was Karnos sitting. This as much as an ironstove+Karnos team makes sense to me in gut Thor and Karnos were at each others throats. I pressured him at first to see if he was replicating 1800 a bit but how Karnos has acted after the innocent child reveal makes it clear it's not 1800. He'd have been more \"panicky\" IMHO. Even in 1800 some of his posts had that \"urgency\" do it now bit. Either Thor gave him some meta tips or Karnos is probably town as much as that set up reminded me of 1800. I think I'm just biased to reading Karnos as scum. (With a large caveat of if Penguin Power flips town Then look at Karnos again with a vengeance.)<br><br>This also makes sense with myself, Saru, and Nero being the only ones off of Thor at the end of D2 (Assuming Penguin+Lowell+Thor) Saru would be AFK a lot toward the day end. I and Saru townread Thor (incorrectly) and Nero was the head of the bji wagon. If Nero was going to let Thor be no lynched it's a hell of a lot worse to post and not lynch at the end of the day. It should throw suspicion on him. Instead scum are \"pocketing\" Nero since someone else suspects Nero there is no reason to push there. <br><br>Now take a look at 3.3 PenguinPower was on it early after not being on it D2. It's \"Damn it Thor. You fooled me.\"  This reeks of inevitability. Furthermore in combination with his setup spec post about a rolecop is highly unlikely. Scum if they had one would have used it also on FA to see if he was okay to let go and mislynch. Instead they roleblocked, claimed his role, and killed him. It shows that penguin power isn't investing thoughts into his theory when FA confirmed their was a roleblocker. <br><br>Now furthermore, take a look at the opening after Thor was lynched. It was determined that I was the threat. In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8509588#p8509588\">1379</a> Lowell leaves off pushing Saru. Both he and I had the same explanation as to why we didn't vote Thor. However I was the more popular one. I intentionally revealed at L -2 because scum wouldn't want to be at the end of the wagon that was forming on me. There was an intentional plot to get me mislynched of which Thor would have suggested in night chat. Thor knows I am active crumber (see Wake's mafia) of which I have played with his scum meta (shame on me again for not recognizing it but kudos to him for altering it) and probably found it as soon as I replaced in and asked Lowell and Penguin Power to push. Between his inconsistency when Lowell should have been pushing Saru but instead pushes me means he is looking for an active mislynch and doesn't use his limited posts to actually hunt.<br><br>Now examine the Arona kill. This one directly leads to Penguin Power OR Saru. However Penguin didn't even try to think about who killed the townies and why. Half of the game is who posts what as scumreads and the other half is who dies. If you aren't focusing on who dies and why there's something wrong.<br><br>FA was a claimed PR and then GreyICE died. That's not indicative. What is indicative is that FA was roleblocked. It tells us that one of two things happened:<br>At that point scum had no idea of the other PRs and roleblocked and attempted to kill him<br>OR<br>Scum roleblocked FA and killed someone else and GreyICE either died as a result of being targeted or choosing that target. <br><br>There is also the possibility that Saru scum killed both GreyICE and Arona. Simply for suspecting him. Then the only potential partners for Saru in this case would be Penguin Power or ironstove. Karnos, bji, and Lowell wouldn't use their posts to townread Saru. (Note:Lowell's townread of Saru is unexplained push that.) Either way by lynching Power Penguin we take out a lot. Too much townreading would indicate a \"WHY AREN'T YOU DEAD?\" question. <br><br>It is also fishy as fuck that three people who are widely townread have the exact same scum team. (Karnos, bji, and stove) Note that Karnos again was floated around today. Similar to the bji argument Karnos is actually a threat because of where he is instinctively placing Lowell. The only way I see Karnos scum is with ironstove and in that case, we're fucked because ironstove could claim scum (like he did and I think I figured out why but I'm actually not saying why)</div></div></div><br><br><div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: \"GIVE ME THE TLDR MATH NOW!!!!!!\"</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display: none;\">I only see certain combinations possible and in order of priority those are:<br>Penguin Power + Lowell<br>Saru + Penguin Power<br>Saru + ironstove<br>Karnos + ironstove<br><br>Hard town reading : bji, Nero<br>Light town read: ironstove<br>Waffle House: Karnos<br>Light scum read: Saru (by night actions only by posts he seems townie)<br>The likely scum team: Penguin Power + Lowell</div></div></div><br><br>Ironstove, we agree on Penguin (or used to before your random unexplained Penguin is town bit).

The \"someone please hammer me\" dramatics could easily be fake, given that no one was going to jump ahead of Math and hammer anyone.  I'm still more sold on the Nero lynch than the Penguin lynch though.  Let me reiterate my case on Nero, so that it's very clear:<br><br>- He started a wagon on what turned out to be a bad mislynch and which I think could have been identified as a bad mislynch at the time<br>- He is the only one to have explicitly called Mal scum, everyone else recognized it as a policy lynch.  To me this could easily be a slip, overplaying his hand.<br>- He started that wagon right after FA claimed.  The chances that FA was going to be lynched after claiming were low, anyone could have seen that, and Nero's first vote after the FA claim was the start of the Mal mislynch wagon, \"coincidentally\" timed right when scum needed a better wagon than the FA wagon.<br>- <div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: \"Thor/Nero interactions\"</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display: none;\"><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8426283#p8426283\" class=\"postlink\">post 370</a>, Thor665 wrote:</cite>Of what I've read?

What exactly was I to do yesterday anyways? First off I had a busy weekend, but also, both of my top 3 scum reads were up on the chopping block yesterday for pretty much the entire day. Did you want me to come in and yell \"woot\" or something? Math had ask for a list of my reads and I provided. And then I noted I'd prefer penguin but nero was ok too. Nero turned out town so now it's penguin that I definitely want. If you want to know the bug, it's the fact that obvious flailing scum got away yesterday. Heck, even iron said he only town read Penguin yesterday(after reading him as scum for years) because the flailing looked so \"authentic\", which is laughable. Shit like that annoys me.<br><br>And as if Penguin's case on me is any good...<img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol2.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"Laughing\"> His case on me is lurking, which then he should be calling Lowell my partner instead of Karnos. And then even his NK speculation doesn't hold up in logic, as I pointed out.<br><br>You know, it's funny. Penguin says Karnos and I are scum. That makes zero sense. Karnos and I got into a huge fight D1 and then I started tunneling Thor which then got Karnos calling both Thor and me scum, but then eventually Thor scum and me probably town. And then Thor started calling me town and Karnos scum. Like if you read all that, it makes zero sense that Karnos and I could have been scum with Thor. It's like a three-way fuckfest of bussing that would eventually lead to one of us getting lynched anyways, which is stupid since Karnos and I risked our encryptor big time. Especially doing such a thing on D1 and into D2 is like downright stupid.<br><br>Another thing: I'm pretty damn sure at this point Lowell is the partner. Besides the fact that Penguin pairs me with Karnos instead of Lowell, if you look through the ISOs of the people who can be scum and who still live, there are only 2 people in the game who never ever voted for Thor until he was confirmed scum, DING DING DING: Penguin and Lowell. Actually, they never even voted Tracer who Thor replaced. Even I voted Tracer at one point. Here's the kicker: Lowell got cold feet and never hammered Thor even though he promised he would, so he hadn't voted Thor even once in the game. Penguin only voted him when he was confirmed. There's a reason why they never touched him: they needed the day-talk. Can't lose that, now can they? Also, something I never noted until a quick re-read, penguin defended Thor pretty damn hard from Iron around the early-mid 900s. <br><br>Plus, I can't forget the fact that Lowell attacking me earlier in the game was as scum as it gets. Like holy shit. His attacks were just a bunch of hypocritical attacks about lurking (when he was the #1 lurker and still is) and he avoided addressing my points about the mal wagon for ages. <br><br>Like, honestly, I don't know how much more shit I have to point out to show scum!Penguin. I'll leave it up to Math, but remember Math, you had Penguin nailed yesterday and then you gave the benefit of the doubt to iron and then lynched town. That rings a bell in my head of our last game where you nailed me and then let me go as scum. Just, don't fuck this up again, please.<br><br>I'll let ma boi iron get the last word here:<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8470914#p8470914\" class=\"postlink\">post 951</a>, ironstove talking to penguin wrote:</cite>Oh that's right, you have none, because you were lollygagging all of D1 and were perfectly fine with a mislynch taking place, you have applied 0 pressure onto others, and all you've done is come by making negative comments about why cases are bad while doing 0 scum hunting yourself, providing 0 reads, providing 0 cases on who you think is scum. <br><br>Reading through your ISO, you're literally just posting filler, 0 content, 0 anything, same as the last time you were scum.</div></blockquote><br>Well fucking said.<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8470919#p8470919\" class=\"postlink\">post 952</a>, ironstove wrote:</cite><span class=\"noboldsig\">You legit think I'm the most scummy of all the players in this game, then I've obviously hit gold with my thor lynch, is he your mafia PR or something? </span><br><br>I find it hilarious you find me scummy, under what grounds?

He's essentially making up teams to appease Math, like Lowell said. Next, for example, if Math says she wants to lynch bji, then Penguin will probably come up with some half-assed excuse to link bji with someone else to push the lynch. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol2.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"Laughing\"> <br><br>Also, remember when he promised to tunnel Karnos today if Nero flipped town yesterday? Good times. <br><br>Like something is totally off here. Either he's hoping bji gives him town cred for bussing his partner tomorrow (since Math is likely dead tonight), or Penguin/Karnos is a team. I doubt the latter, since Lowell keeps his options open between Penguin and Karnos, rather than just Penguin. But in the extreme case that it is the latter, I want Penguin gone first. <br><br>bji can make the judgement call on the partner tomorrow.

I recall putting saru to L-1 to avoid a no lynch, then coming back to find some random rube dead.</div></blockquote><br><br>These two posts stand out because the first one Lowell is saying that Saru is not a scum read for him, but that he's voting Saru to avoid a NL.  Then in the second post he re-votes Saru at the beginning of D2 still without any actual scum read.  And he also uses the phrase \"coming back to find some random rube dead\", which implies that he interprets the lynch of Mal as being without good explanation ... this seems disingenuous because he had voted Saru \"just to avoid a NL\", a day and a half before the deadline, which seems pretty arbitrary too.  This posturing of \"what are you all doing, my lynch choice was much better\" seems fake because he admitted that his lynch choice was just to avoid a NL long before such a reason was valid.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8461145#p8461145\" class=\"postlink\">post 864</a>, Lowell wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8460954#p8460954\" class=\"postlink\">post 861</a>, Thor665 wrote:</cite><br>I couldn't describe the Saru case for the life of me - I think the theory is that I'm his partner or something, while being accused of both buddying him, and not defending him.

I'm very much here, aren't I? I will admit, the meat world is a bummer. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\"><br><br>Secondly, if you think Penguin's play means he rolled scum then how much he is actually playing makes no difference. Surely, you'd see that his activeness comes in the form of mainly one-liners that don't say much? iron sure seemed to think so. Compare with my posts that seem to have actual substance (and I'll admit, they're sparse in terms of quantity, but that's irrelevant to the point) that try to figure out motives of people (i.e. Thor and Karnos) rather than just baseless accusations (like Lowell and Penguin). Surprisingly (or not), Penguin's posts only get <span style=\"font-style: italic\">slightly</span> bigger as he starts being suspected from yesterday. Substance from defense rather than from scum-hunting. Not very good substance, imo.<br><br>Lastly, I wouldn't be too excited about lynching Lowell today. Both Penguin and Lowell are scummy as fuck, and one of them has to go today, but Penguin seems to be better at escaping the noose compared to Lowell. He's done it two days in a row now. No offense to bji, but I don't see Penguin necessarily being lynched tomorrow. Instead, I predict more flailing and emotional BS that will let him win it all. I would not be a happy camper. But hey, I would love to be wrong."}

It makes you feel like someone else is driving the game because we can't really do anything without Math anyway.  We can't build a wagon because it's pointless to build one that Math isn't willing to hammer, so it feels like we're just waiting to hear Math's plan and then express our opinions.  And he/she/it hasn't posted a plan yet."}

Scum or Town penguin would act the same way in this case, so it doesn't tell us anything new.</div></blockquote><br>It doesn't matter if both scum or town Penguin would do such a thing, because it's about the timing. <br><br>Penguin chose Lowell/Saru  as his team (and voted Lowell) only AFTER Math chose to want to lynch Lowell. The question is, why move away from a Saru/Karnos team at that time? One could say \"oh well maybe he saw your post and understood that a Karnos/Saru team would make no sense because of the bussing factor\" to which I would respond: then why was Penguin pushing a team who he had done no research about and also, why would he believe someone who he is scum reading to convince him of a different team? Maybe Karnos IS my partner, and I've successfully fooled Penguin into thinking otherwise?<br><br>Furthermore, why would Penguin not instead say a Karnos/Lowell team since he promised to bus Karnos today? The answer is simple: he needs Karnos on his side tomorrow after he buses his partner. Penguin knows his partner is doomed today because everyone is saying Lowell is scum (otherwise he'd want to win the game right away by finishing me off like he was trying to earlier), and he can't defend him, so he has to lynch him. And he won't include Karnos in his scum list or push him because he needs Karnos on his side tomorrow. He puts me in as the partner because he knows I'll never lynch bji or Karnos, so there's no point in trying to appease me. It's really the only option he has left. I'm sure the original plan was to try and get Karnos or myself lynched today, but Lowell getting caught out ruined that. <br><br>Anyways, Penguin's point about my \"inane drivel\" is hilarious. It's inane drivel because it's about him. Or maybe he needs an excuse not to respond to it, because he can't. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\";)\" title=\"Wink\"><br><br>I would be fine with a Lowell lynch today, but the one thing I would request is that Math/bji pick who they think the third partner is. The reason is because nothing will change tomorrow from today. Lowell will flip scum, Math will die, and we'll be back to where we were at the start of this day with Penguin and I calling each other scum. The difference will be that our IC will be dead, and they'll have no input on the lynch process. So it's better now that Math/bji agree on a third partner and they be lynched tomorrow straight away. Any discussion that would happen tomorrow about the last scum can happen today since we still have like a week left. Unless either of you think that some new discussion will arise tomorrow that wouldn't or couldn't be discussed today?"}

Someone killed the (at the time) only confirmed town in the game.  His defense of \"why would I do that, it looks so suspicious\" is WIFOM as whoa, and, obviously, not true since he's already survived a day and now on the verge of a scum win.  Of the other three I've been leaning karnos, but now might be coming around to saru or bj.

I suppose everyone does that from time to time, but for penguin it seems to be a pattern.  The reason I don't like these statements is that they feel a bit gamed.  I can see them being a setup where you can later say, \"but how can you believe I'm scum if you didn't do the [impossible thing] that I asked you to do to verify that I'm town?\", or even if it never gets to a specific exchange like that, town players may subconsciously feel that X has been proven just because they know that they didn't do the thing they were asked to do to prove X so out of a sense of 'fairness' they may be more likely to just believe 'X', as in, \"it's not fair of me to think that penguin is scum when he told me what to do to verify that he's town and I was too lazy to do it.\"<br><br>Another big example of that was the \"someone please hammer me\" dramatics at the end of day ... what was it?  Day 4?  When penguin was at L-1 and Math held the hammer and penguin was spouting all of this emotion and asking for people to hammer him to put him out of his misery and also saying that he should just hammer himself.  Well, he must have known that no town player was going to hammer him with a confirmed IC having asked to hold the hammer and having been granted it, so what was the point of those dramatics?  It feels like the same kind of psychological manipulation.</div></div></div>"}

I called 2/3 by D2, which isn't bad for someone as shitty a town player as me. I'm happy I tried to actually engage in a fruitful conversation with arona when he started suspecting me, and not just start tunneling/suspecting him, which is what I might usually do lmfao. Somewhat of an improvement, I guess. Thor's WK'ing of me was obvious from a mile away, especially given what happened to me in Mini 1823. Lowell was obvious as shit, and his lurking was like 10x worse than it usually is, and he has stated before that he absolutely hates being scum. So all that in aggregate was his doom in my eyes.<br><br>bji did good with the bussing on Thor. I never bus (and probably never will) as scum, and I generally think it's a shitty idea, and so I started projecting my own (as I usually do) scum play onto others, which was silly. But in others way, bji did well, and I never really gave him any thought as a player until much later. So kudos.<br><br>I thought Penguin was actually getting all emotional and shit as scum because I thought he was trying something similar to what I did in my last scum game against rb, where I was being so overly dramatic and emotional to the point where 2 town players thought \"no way scum plays like that, that's genuine town emotion\" and I didn't want a repeat of that on me. Plus, penguin's defense of Thor didn't help him. And him getting away from the lynch like twice was eating at me. And a whole bunch of other stuff.<br><br>And, for the record Penguin, I never actually called you a \"herp derp\" in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8544533#p8544533\">2027</a>. I was using it as like \"obviously\" in relation to the posts I had made earlier about you being scum, although I can see how that could have been misread. Even if I was calling you a herp derp (which is not my style anyways), I don't really think it's much to get triggered over. Hardly an insult. And it's unfortunate you don't like my posting style, can't do much about that.<br><br>Anyways, thanks to Foxbird for modding! You were plentiful with the VCs, which is always nice to see!

I had a last minute wagon on me so regardless of my alignment my claim was going to come late also, to be perfectly frank, I sort of think I wasn't going to be lynched regardless of a claim, and at the time I claimed if I'd been more awake and realized it was last minute I would have expressly not claimed just to leave more options open."}
