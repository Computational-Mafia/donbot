The moderator gets 14 votes.<br>2) Please use vote tags to place your votes. <span style=\"color: blue\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Bold tags will not be counted.</span></span><br>3) Lynches will occur when one player has received the majority of votes. You may post during the twilight period between the hammer and the closing of the thread.<br>4) If unsufficient votes are made on any player, or a majority of votes have been made to no lynch, no lynch will be made.<br>5) Nights will last 48 hours.<br>6) Do NOT quote any private communication from me, nor any mason, scum, neighbour, or house party topics that may or may not exist. You may paraphrase, just don't copy it wholesale.<br>7) You MAY NOT discuss the game outside of the thread unless your role specifically gives you the ability to do so.<br>8) Days will last 2 weeks, or until a lynch (or no lynch) has been decided on.<br>9) <span style=\"color: blue\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Blue is my color.</span></span> Refrain from using it.<br>10) Inform the mod before going V/LA. I will prod you after 48 hours of inactivity, and then again after 24 hours. At that point, I will be forced to replace you.<br>11) In the tragic event I drop off the face of the earth, a backup moderator will take my place.<br>12) In the event a deadline is reached, it will become a no lynch by default.<br>13) Death is final, but a single contentless \"bah!\" post will be permitted.<br>14) The rules can be arbitrarily changed/added to by one party (me) anytime I am feeling greedy and/or evil.<br>15) Be nice, and try to enjoy yourself.<br><br>Failure to abide by these rules is punishable by hours and hours of forced Justin Bieber listening.<br><br>This setup uses daytalk.<br><br>Example PM:<br><br>You are a Vanilla Townie.<br>You are aligned with the Town.<br>Your only tool is your vote.<br>You win when all anti-town factions are dead and there is at least one town alive.<br><br><div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: Alive</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display: none;\">Frozen Angel</div></div></div><br><div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: Dead</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display: none;\">Mathilda the <span style=\"color: green\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Vanilla Townie</span></span> was lynched D1.<br><br>MattP the <span style=\"color: green\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">1-Shot Vigilante</span></span> was killed N1.<br>Lowell the <span style=\"color: green\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Odd-Night Cop</span></span> was killed N1.<br><br><strike>Dwlee99</strike> Firebringer the <span style=\"color: red\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Mafia Motion Detector</span></span> was lynched D2.<br><br>Iraonavp the <span style=\"color: green\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Vanilla Townie</span></span> was killed N2.<br><br>Albert B.

I was simply agreeing with Garmr's statement. You probed me for further explanation and now you're accusing me on nitpicking, that's underhanded.<br><br>Accusing someone of not generating new content on d1 is weak. In general trying to find themes in a player's posting early in the game is silly. I also engaged with Taly about the wagon speed.

It makes more sense in my head, but I have trouble putting it into words! Again, I don't see how me being hypothetically wrong here could be indicative of my alignment.</div></blockquote><br>How? You're saying you have issue with me making a value judgment over the apparent utility of my posting when the foundation of the push garmr has on me is that there was clearly no utility to my post so why would I make it? Why wouldn't my response be to then explain why I made the initial post called into question so he could understand my reasoning for making it.

Voting for an inactive player with the intent of applying pressure to get content is a reasonable strategy. The problem is that any utility in that move is lost when he switches his vote to Radja before Mathilda comes back. I assume that the ability to create the plan implies the ability to foresee that Mathilda might have a delayed entrance or that someone might question the strategy, and I don't like that the plan derailed in response to those entirely foreseeable circumstances.

It's speculation about the set-up but being cagey about being saying anything contentious that I think is setting up an alarm bell for me. And then to say that having a miller does not guarantee a cop, well, it kind of does. It would be a bastard game if it did not. If there's genuinely a miller then the mod is effectively telling us that yes there is a cop. And if there is not a cop then the mod is lying to us, hence a bastard game.<br><br>But more importantly, why is this being speculated upon?"}

Even if I misinterpreted it, taking it for face value you're asking the playerlist if it's normal for a vig to claim in a normal game, which is also a bizarre question anyway. You didn't ask the question in the way you're now saying you intended it, you never talked about \"optimal play\""}

Players skate around a rink and try to shoot a puck in the opposing net that is guarded by a goalie.<br><br>The game is won after three periods by the team with the most goals.<br><br>In recent years, analysts have been studying \"advanced statistics\". In other words, collecting information. Possession, shots for, shots against, faceoff wins, controlled zone entries.<br><br>The theory is that if a team shoots the puck more than gets shot at, possesses the puck longer, wins more faceoffs, and enters the opposing team's side of the ice with the puck more often, they will come out ahead. But those don't always translate directly to goals. One netminder can singlehandedly change the entire game's outcome by a combination of luck and skill. So while the coaches do pay attention to all the aforementioned \"advanced stats\" to develop their strategy, the players themselves have to focus on \"high scoring chances\". Shots taken in the slot, the zone directly in front of the net, have higher impact than shots taken from the periphery, or from the neutral zone, for example.<br><br>All this to say that the vig should always shoot whether he's confident or not because no matter what the structure of the coach is, high scoring chances must be capitalized upon.<br><br>The greatest hockey player to ever skate, Wayne Gretzky, famously said \"you miss 100% of the shots you don't take\". My point is the vig is a very pro-town role and should be given free reign to shoot for us to get better odds of winning. I'm going to bed now. Good night."}

I have played with Garmr before and I don't remember him like this. He was scum in Mini 1741 but the whole game was a mess with one scum outing all his buddies and the game should have been scrapped rather than played out.

First off dwlee has contributed little to the game yet very active and engaging with people. What I'm saying is he is talking and not hunting in a majority of his posts.<br><br>2. He is extremely jumpy with me. It looks like he was trying to find a reason to vote/make me look bad me like saying the white knighting thing,the iioa incident ect.<br><br>3 When he was talking about iioa. I explained why he was using it wrong and How it was supposed to be used when a majority of posts are that way. His response didn't want to let it go and said he was using it on a individualistic bases. I then asked him why he thought that instance was scummy and what would the scummy objective behind it. He never stated a reason and flat out ignored it.<br><br>4. I pointed out a post were he implied I was town earlier game when he mentioned where did I ever say I was town. he said but that's in the past. Despite it being exactly when he accused me of iioa.<br><br>5 Tried to push not having a impact as scummy thing instead of town not agreeing with me. Acting like I have control over others.<br><br>6 Trying to push a scummy veil over me despite not ever saying he scummed read me and not admitting to it when I was pushing for his read on me.

I am not familiar with MattP but he seems rather cocky, which can be read as being defensive. Garmr is burrowing into him like an African parasite but is that because Garmr is town and is also suspicious of him or is it because he's a scum buddy distancing himself from MattP? I have played with Garmr before and I don't remember him like this. He was scum in Mini 1741 but the whole game was a mess with one scum outing all his buddies and the game should have been scrapped rather than played out. So it's no wonder that Garmr was less active in that game. Overall though I am getting a town vibe from Garmr.<br><br>So the only one I'm happy voting for at the moment is MattP.

We play it for fun. When someone accuses you of being scum (and it can be annoying for sure!), then it has nothing to do with you <span style=\"font-style: italic\">personally</span>, but just how you play the game. We are fallible. We all make mistakes. Even when you know that we are wrong, we might not know it. We play to win. Take it lightly. It is supposed to be fun!<br><br>As scum, I frame people. I use everything I can against them (of course, not literally <span style=\"font-style: italic\">everything</span>), but sometimes it causes people to respond in an intensive manner. I might buddy you for a few days and then lynch you anyway when it becomes convenient for me. Some people would perceive that as betrayal (and take it personal), but it is part of the game. <br><br>As town, I try my best to lynch scum. I can be wrong, but sometimes I have to act like I cannot be wrong; that I somehow know that someone is scum for sure. This might be perceived as mean or unjust if you are actually town and forget that it is just a game. But I don't know everything. I have to make guesses all the time, maximize the probability of winning.<br><br>In the end, it doesn't matter who wins, or what I am. I like most of you people here, including you. I have yet to meet someone on this forum that I truly dislike personally."}

Did he actually read those games? Who knows. Point is, he hasn't given any reason WHY he believes Matilda to be scum. This makes it very easy to press a dishonest and indefensible assertion. Not only this, he asserts he's read multiple games! And not ONE point of analysis? Come on! Scumfuckery all around when you can't even explain why you think someone is SO SCUM that you say you see NO WAY that they're town. <br><br>Well big boy, she was town.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7533831#p7533831\" class=\"postlink\">post 869</a>, AlwaysInnocent wrote:</cite>Hmm.

So let's give context, AI generally keeps his cute little reads lists of super safe green reads and no explanation behind it that everyone for whatever asinine reason likes to say \"Sure I agree with ___ but ___ is null/scum\". Why the hell does no one say \"Give me a goddamn reason\"? Reads lists are absolute shit with no reason. They're not worth the time it took to copy and paste names and add fancy little colors because you know what? His reads are so damn safe and in line with the rest of the town that it's basically saying \"HEY I'M A CONFORMIST EVERYONE IGNORE ME PLEASE\". <br><br>So now coming out and putting FA to null, with NO REASON outside Mattp himself saying something? He even disagrees with it and then basically states \"Whatever I disagree with your entire premise but she's still null\". \"Her reactions are just terrible\"? Can you please be bothered to quote a post? <br><br>Oh and that snarky bullshit \"Nothing wrong with townreading as long as you revise it\" is hilarious considering that as scum, your town pool NEEDS to shrink so you can constantly lynch more. No, town are very, very consistent in reads and will have logic behind a change. Your change is the last thing from fluid, it is COUNTER INTUITIVE. <br><br>So this is one scum down. The next order of business is to go dig up Mattp's reads. It's good to NKA this kill due to possible mafia fear or reads or both. It's a real travesty when people simply ignore the reads of others. We can do it with Lowell as well but 99% chance that Mattp shot him."}

I can't understand whether or not you are being serious.<br><br>I do not see why you are reading Direfire as town-aligned and your dismissive explanations have done nothing to help me. The conclusion I lean towards drawing in the absence of sufficient evidence is that you are calling Direfire town-aligned in the certain knowledge that he is town-aligned, so that if he is lynched you gain more ammunition against players like Aeronaut and ABR.<br><br>Aeronaut's <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7549006#p7549006\">1071</a> resonates with me: I am having trouble because I cannot see both Firebringer and Direfire as scum-aligned together. In simplified terms, Firebringer reads Direfire as town-aligned and Direfire reads Firebringer as scum-aligned. This is not how I would expect bussing to look, Firebringer would likely erupt with theatrical distancing if they were both scum-aligned.<br><br>Therefore I must be wrong somewhere and I can't work out how.<br><br>Direfire seems the safest option considering how Firebringer is uncooperative and may just be playing badly. I also did not have significant suspicions of Dwlee's posting before Firebringer replaced in. I think Firebringer's independent perspective could be indicative of him being town-aligned in the sense of being unafraid of saying what he thinks. But to an extent it does seem theatrical and overplayed.<br><br>I am still hesitant to place a vote so I think I'll go question other people for a bit."}

It's pretty abysmal as a form of shade-throwing since he is not making a case at all, so it's going to have minimal affect on others' opinion of you. Therefore I don't think the intention was to underhandedly cast doubt on you.</div></blockquote><br><br>Shade-throwing as opposed to a straight up accusation is indicative of scum being too afraid of being tied into an argument and thus trying to get away with just doubting a slot or taking away from their legitimacy without actually making a case. Which is why he has no permission to do so. If he wants to pull the bullshit of \"I have doubts\", which guess what? It's a mafia game and we all do, get some better reasons. <br><br>You are completely wrong that 'having doubts' and admitting them in a mafia game shows town. It is so far from it because guess what? SCUM WISH TO SHOW that they have doubts since they know most everything outside specific roles. This lip service isn't town at all. So that line isn't going to work. The whole point is he gets a discredit in a short post which is almost incontestable on any grounds and doesn't need to back it up with reasoning.</div></blockquote><br>Okay, let's agree to disagree here since that's not really the point I'm trying to get across.<br><br>I think your response tells me that you consider things in a way that makes policy lynching someone and normally lynching someone similar. Which seemed a bit suspicious to me before but I think it's just part of your playstyle."}

I have played with Garmr before and I don't remember him like this. He was scum in Mini 1741 but the whole game was a mess with one scum outing all his buddies and the game should have been scrapped rather than played out.
