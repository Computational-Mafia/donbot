The moderator gets 14 votes.<br>\n2) Please use vote tags to place your votes. <div style=\"display:inline;color:blue\">Bold tags will not be counted.</div><br>\n3) Lynches will occur when one player has received the majority of votes. You may post during the twilight period between the hammer and the closing of the thread.<br>\n4) If unsufficient votes are made on any player, or a majority of votes have been made to no lynch, no lynch will be made.<br>\n5) Nights will last 48 hours.<br>\n6) Do NOT quote any private communication from me, nor any mason, scum, neighbour, or house party topics that may or may not exist. You may paraphrase, just don't copy it wholesale.<br>\n7) You MAY NOT discuss the game outside of the thread unless your role specifically gives you the ability to do so.<br>\n8) Days will last 2 weeks, or until a lynch (or no lynch) has been decided on.<br>\n9) <div style=\"display:inline;color:blue\">Blue is my color.</div> Refrain from using it.<br>\n10) Inform the mod before going V/LA. I will prod you after 48 hours of inactivity, and then again after 24 hours. At that point, I will be forced to replace you.<br>\n11) In the tragic event I drop off the face of the earth, a backup moderator will take my place.<br>\n12) In the event a deadline is reached, it will become a no lynch by default.<br>\n13) Death is final, but a single contentless \"bah!\" post will be permitted.<br>\n14) The rules can be arbitrarily changed/added to by one party (me) anytime I am feeling greedy and/or evil.<br>\n15) Be nice, and try to enjoy yourself.<br>\n<br>\nFailure to abide by these rules is punishable by hours and hours of forced Justin Bieber listening.<br>\n<br>\nThis setup uses daytalk.<br>\n<br>\nExample PM:<br>\n<br>\nYou are a Vanilla Townie.<br>\nYou are aligned with the Town.<br>\nYour only tool is your vote.<br>\nYou win when all anti-town factions are dead and there is at least one town alive.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: Alive</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\">Frozen Angel</div></div></div><br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: Dead</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\">Mathilda the <div style=\"display:inline;color:green\">Vanilla Townie</div> was lynched D1.<br>\n<br>\nMattP the <div style=\"display:inline;color:green\">1-Shot Vigilante</div> was killed N1.<br>\nLowell the <div style=\"display:inline;color:green\">Odd-Night Cop</div> was killed N1.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline-flex;text-decoration:line-through\">Dwlee99</div> Firebringer the <div style=\"display:inline;color:red\">Mafia Motion Detector</div> was lynched D2.<br>\n<br>\nIraonavp the <div style=\"display:inline;color:green\">Vanilla Townie</div> was killed N2.<br>\n<br>\nAlbert B.

Through the point is weaker what he is ignoring is initial response. He focus's on the the why question which I admitted and said time again was a weaker part of my case as I thought his initial response was scummy and he hasn't brought a satisfactory answer to the table to answer that. <br>\n<br>\n-He tried changing what he said and even with the changed explanation it still lead to the same result of him worrying about he is perceived instead of trying to add value to hunting scum.<br>\n<br>\n-It's also possible that mattp is on the scum team and intentionally did that drop to try and find out if there is any dr now I think about it. There is plenty of scum motive to do that and no town motive.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nAlso look at how fast the wagon assembled then disassembled there was likely scum on the wagon and I think it was a early bus and saw the opportunity to jump off.

Despite being on the matt wagon from the beginning (before it was dangerous), iraon several times subtly tries to derail it (\"well, maybe it is the drugs, idk\"... \"there's 'nuance', *shrugs shoulders*\") without unvoting.  Then, when (thank heavens!) someone gives him the excuse to jump by accusing him of going for an easy lynch, he jumps (161)!  Haha, showed you guys, I didn't settle for an easy lynch-- but OMG you guys don't worry I still think matt may be scum, btw!<br>\n<br>\nIf I had to guess, and using the common parlance, I'd say iraon is \"white knighting\" matt (as scum), but it could also be that he's trying to derail a wagon on his teammate.  Either way, there's no pro-town reason why someone on the leading wagon would be so squishy about leaving it, if he thought it was the right thing to do.<br>\n<br>\nAs mentioned earlier, I'm inclined to trust Taly's claim.  ABR's purported history and WIFOM notwithstanding, I find it unlikely he'd come out with that claim (in his first post) if he were scum.  I've also got townreads on Aero, Dier, and Dwlee.

Despite being on the matt wagon from the beginning (before it was dangerous), iraon several times subtly tries to derail it (\"well, maybe it is the drugs, idk\"... \"there's 'nuance', *shrugs shoulders*\") without unvoting.  Then, when (thank heavens!) someone gives him the excuse to jump by accusing him of going for an easy lynch, he jumps (161)!  Haha, showed you guys, I didn't settle for an easy lynch-- but OMG you guys don't worry I still think matt may be scum, btw!<br>\n<br>\nIf I had to guess, and using the common parlance, I'd say iraon is \"white knighting\" matt (as scum), but it could also be that he's trying to derail a wagon on his teammate.  Either way, there's no pro-town reason why someone on the leading wagon would be so squishy about leaving it, if he thought it was the right thing to do.<br>\n<br>\nAs mentioned earlier, I'm inclined to trust Taly's claim.  ABR's purported history and WIFOM notwithstanding, I find it unlikely he'd come out with that claim (in his first post) if he were scum.  I've also got townreads on Aero, Dier, and Dwlee.  Also an <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">fos Frozen</div>. Largely gut here, but in general the case is: asking questions is helpful, until it isn't anymore, and Frozen may be assuming more a \"leadership\" role than a \"being helpful\" role.</div></blockquote><br>\nYou certianly seem... methodical!<br>\n<br>\nI would say that you've twisted a lot of things here. For example, 161 vs 198, reading players as scum-aligned because they used meta, reading players as town-aligned just because you agree with them. And every time you've mentioned me you put a minus, surely there can't be only bad things to comment on about my posts?<br>\n<br>\nNo, I do not currently view MattP as scum-aligned, that is why I unvoted him. I feel I have given enough clarity in my stances that your accusation of equivocation is unfounded. I am simply being as transparent as possible, I do not attempt to remain on a wagon that no longer feels right, nor do I feign confidence I don't actually have in a read.<br>\n<br>\nIt seems as if you skimmed through the thread once, decided who you thought was scum-aligned, and then went through every post looking for justification.", "time": "Mon Dec 28, 2015 6:24 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=64736&start=275", "forum": "53", "thread": "64736"}

Voting for an inactive player with the intent of applying pressure to get content is a reasonable strategy. The problem is that any utility in that move is lost when he switches his vote to Radja before Mathilda comes back. I assume that the ability to create the plan implies the ability to foresee that Mathilda might have a delayed entrance or that someone might question the strategy, and I don't like that the plan derailed in response to those entirely foreseeable circumstances.

I have played with Garmr before and I don't remember him like this. He was scum in Mini 1741 but the whole game was a mess with one scum outing all his buddies and the game should have been scrapped rather than played out.

I am not familiar with MattP but he seems rather cocky, which can be read as being defensive. Garmr is burrowing into him like an African parasite but is that because Garmr is town and is also suspicious of him or is it because he's a scum buddy distancing himself from MattP? I have played with Garmr before and I don't remember him like this. He was scum in Mini 1741 but the whole game was a mess with one scum outing all his buddies and the game should have been scrapped rather than played out.

Players skate around a rink and try to shoot a puck in the opposing net that is guarded by a goalie.<br>\n<br>\nThe game is won after three periods by the team with the most goals.<br>\n<br>\nIn recent years, analysts have been studying \"advanced statistics\". In other words, collecting information. Possession, shots for, shots against, faceoff wins, controlled zone entries.<br>\n<br>\nThe theory is that if a team shoots the puck more than gets shot at, possesses the puck longer, wins more faceoffs, and enters the opposing team's side of the ice with the puck more often, they will come out ahead. But those don't always translate directly to goals. One netminder can singlehandedly change the entire game's outcome by a combination of luck and skill. So while the coaches do pay attention to all the aforementioned \"advanced stats\" to develop their strategy, the players themselves have to focus on \"high scoring chances\". Shots taken in the slot, the zone directly in front of the net, have higher impact than shots taken from the periphery, or from the neutral zone, for example.<br>\n<br>\nAll this to say that the vig should always shoot whether he's confident or not because no matter what the structure of the coach is, high scoring chances must be capitalized upon.<br>\n<br>\nThe greatest hockey player to ever skate, Wayne Gretzky, famously said \"you miss 100% of the shots you don't take\". My point is the vig is a very pro-town role and should be given free reign to shoot for us to get better odds of winning. I'm going to bed now.

I am not familiar with MattP but he seems rather cocky, which can be read as being defensive. Garmr is burrowing into him like an African parasite but is that because Garmr is town and is also suspicious of him or is it because he's a scum buddy distancing himself from MattP? I have played with Garmr before and I don't remember him like this. He was scum in Mini 1741 but the whole game was a mess with one scum outing all his buddies and the game should have been scrapped rather than played out. So it's no wonder that Garmr was less active in that game. Overall though I am getting a town vibe from Garmr.<br>\n<br>\nSo the only one I'm happy voting for at the moment is MattP.

I explained why he was using it wrong and How it was supposed to be used when a majority of posts are that way. His response didn't want to let it go and said he was using it on a individualistic bases. I then asked him why he thought that instance was scummy and what would the scummy objective behind it. He never stated a reason and flat out ignored it.<br>\n<br>\n4. I pointed out a post were he implied I was town earlier game when he mentioned where did I ever say I was town. he said but that's in the past.

Acting like I have control over others.<br>\n<br>\n6 Trying to push a scummy veil over me despite not ever saying he scummed read me and not admitting to it when I was pushing for his read on me.

I have tried now to get people to lay out a case as to why they think I am scum. The best I can get are vague reasons without any references to specific posts. That's ideal scum play, to throw shade on people without committing yourself or letting the accused defend themselves.

Chances are that Day 1 lynches will always be mislynches. Their value is in the information it generates. I'm vanilla and my role is to generate information for town. Normally that means full-on scum hunting and sticking my neck above the parapet. But I've come to expect a wagon to form on me on Day 1 so I figured it's easier to let the scum come to me so I can see who is opportunistic, who is questioning themselves, who is only interested in casting shade etc.<br>\n<br>\nThat doesn't mean to say that all the scum will be on the wagon, but a good proportion of them will be.", "time": "Tue Jan 05, 2016 4:42 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=64736&start=775", "forum": "53", "thread": "64736"}

I am not familiar with MattP but he seems rather cocky, which can be read as being defensive. Garmr is burrowing into him like an African parasite but is that because Garmr is town and is also suspicious of him or is it because he's a scum buddy distancing himself from MattP? I have played with Garmr before and I don't remember him like this. He was scum in Mini 1741 but the whole game was a mess with one scum outing all his buddies and the game should have been scrapped rather than played out. So it's no wonder that Garmr was less active in that game. Overall though I am getting a town vibe from Garmr.<br>\n<br>\nSo the only one I'm happy voting for at the moment is MattP.

We play it for fun. When someone accuses you of being scum (and it can be annoying for sure!), then it has nothing to do with you <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">personally</div>, but just how you play the game. We are fallible. We all make mistakes. Even when you know that we are wrong, we might not know it. We play to win. Take it lightly. It is supposed to be fun!<br>\n<br>\nAs scum, I frame people. I use everything I can against them (of course, not literally <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">everything</div>), but sometimes it causes people to respond in an intensive manner. I might buddy you for a few days and then lynch you anyway when it becomes convenient for me. Some people would perceive that as betrayal (and take it personal), but it is part of the game. <br>\n<br>\nAs town, I try my best to lynch scum. I can be wrong, but sometimes I have to act like I cannot be wrong; that I somehow know that someone is scum for sure. This might be perceived as mean or unjust if you are actually town and forget that it is just a game. But I don't know everything. I have to make guesses all the time, maximize the probability of winning.<br>\n<br>\nIn the end, it doesn't matter who wins, or what I am. I like most of you people here, including you.

The problem is that any utility in that move is lost when he switches his vote to Radja before Mathilda comes back. I assume that the ability to create the plan implies the ability to foresee that Mathilda might have a delayed entrance or that someone might question the strategy, and I don't like that the plan derailed in response to those entirely foreseeable circumstances.

Her reactions are just terrible.<br>\n<br>\n(See there's nothing wrong with initially townreading people, as long as you can revise your reads on them.)</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nAnd this bullshit. So let's give context, AI generally keeps his cute little reads lists of super safe green reads and no explanation behind it that everyone for whatever asinine reason likes to say \"Sure I agree with ___ but ___ is null/scum\". Why the hell does no one say \"Give me a goddamn reason\"? Reads lists are absolute shit with no reason. They're not worth the time it took to copy and paste names and add fancy little colors because you know what? His reads are so damn safe and in line with the rest of the town that it's basically saying \"HEY I'M A CONFORMIST EVERYONE IGNORE ME PLEASE\". <br>\n<br>\nSo now coming out and putting FA to null, with NO REASON outside Mattp himself saying something? He even disagrees with it and then basically states \"Whatever I disagree with your entire premise but she's still null\". \"Her reactions are just terrible\"? Can you please be bothered to quote a post? <br>\n<br>\nOh and that snarky bullshit \"Nothing wrong with townreading as long as you revise it\" is hilarious considering that as scum, your town pool NEEDS to shrink so you can constantly lynch more. No, town are very, very consistent in reads and will have logic behind a change. Your change is the last thing from fluid, it is COUNTER INTUITIVE. <br>\n<br>\nSo this is one scum down. The next order of business is to go dig up Mattp's reads. It's good to NKA this kill due to possible mafia fear or reads or both. It's a real travesty when people simply ignore the reads of others. We can do it with Lowell as well but 99% chance that Mattp shot him.", "time": "Fri Jan 08, 2016 1:08 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=64736&start=975", "forum": "53", "thread": "64736"}

In simplified terms, Firebringer reads Direfire as town-aligned and Direfire reads Firebringer as scum-aligned. This is not how I would expect bussing to look, Firebringer would likely erupt with theatrical distancing if they were both scum-aligned.<br>\n<br>\nTherefore I must be wrong somewhere and I can't work out how.<br>\n<br>\nDirefire seems the safest option considering how Firebringer is uncooperative and may just be playing badly. I also did not have significant suspicions of Dwlee's posting before Firebringer replaced in. I think Firebringer's independent perspective could be indicative of him being town-aligned in the sense of being unafraid of saying what he thinks.

You need reasons to have permission for this. Completely unacceptable to go \"Yeah invalidate his opinion, I don't trust him 'for some reason'.\"</div></blockquote><br>\nI feel as if I do not understand the motivation behind this comment.<br>\n<br>\nAre you saying that you have a problem with Garmr's playstyle (which would not be indicative of alignment), or find this \"shade throwing\" indicative of him being scum-aligned? I would lean towards you intending the latter interpretation, but some of the wording doesn't suggest that. The idea of \"having permission\" doesn't really make sense and seems like an outside aspect of the game unrelated to alignment. Same with \"completely unacceptable\", it sounds like you're attacking his playstyle here.<br>\n<br>\nHowever, I would like to say that I disagree with you and think that openly admitting that you distrust someone but aren't sure why shows transparency and is indicative of Garmr being town-aligned. It's pretty abysmal as a form of shade-throwing since he is not making a case at all, so it's going to have minimal affect on others' opinion of you. Therefore I don't think the intention was to underhandedly cast doubt on you.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nShade-throwing as opposed to a straight up accusation is indicative of scum being too afraid of being tied into an argument and thus trying to get away with just doubting a slot or taking away from their legitimacy without actually making a case. Which is why he has no permission to do so. If he wants to pull the bullshit of \"I have doubts\", which guess what? It's a mafia game and we all do, get some better reasons. <br>\n<br>\nYou are completely wrong that 'having doubts' and admitting them in a mafia game shows town. It is so far from it because guess what? SCUM WISH TO SHOW that they have doubts since they know most everything outside specific roles. This lip service isn't town at all. So that line isn't going to work. The whole point is he gets a discredit in a short post which is almost incontestable on any grounds and doesn't need to back it up with reasoning.</div></blockquote><br>\nOkay, let's agree to disagree here since that's not really the point I'm trying to get across.<br>\n<br>\nI think your response tells me that you consider things in a way that makes policy lynching someone and normally lynching someone similar.

I am not familiar with MattP but he seems rather cocky, which can be read as being defensive. Garmr is burrowing into him like an African parasite but is that because Garmr is town and is also suspicious of him or is it because he's a scum buddy distancing himself from MattP? I have played with Garmr before and I don't remember him like this. He was scum in Mini 1741 but the whole game was a mess with one scum outing all his buddies and the game should have been scrapped rather than played out. So it's no wonder that Garmr was less active in that game. Overall though I am getting a town vibe from Garmr.<br>\n<br>\nSo the only one I'm happy voting for at the moment is MattP.

I am not familiar with MattP but he seems rather cocky, which can be read as being defensive. Garmr is burrowing into him like an African parasite but is that because Garmr is town and is also suspicious of him or is it because he's a scum buddy distancing himself from MattP? I have played with Garmr before and I don't remember him like this. He was scum in Mini 1741 but the whole game was a mess with one scum outing all his buddies and the game should have been scrapped rather than played out. So it's no wonder that Garmr was less active in that game. Overall though I am getting a town vibe from Garmr.<br>\n<br>\nSo the only one I'm happy voting for at the moment is MattP.

Why would scum dwlee try to find a way to lynch me and firebringer do a 360 and try to buddy me if I was scum with them.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\n1 - I don't care youre friend with fire or not. I'm not scumreading you based on your friendship. I'm scumreading you becuase I feel you were bussing him. \"You and him starting to town read each other\" and \" we are friend frozen\" means nothing. if thats the case never play with FB becuase he can be scum and you might miss it becuase \"makes me less likely to want to lynch him\" . in this game I think you were buddies and this is not the case at all.<br>\n<br>\n2 - dwlee had a very bad start. I guess you tried to attack each other to look distant if anyone of you died. and when FB came you found an opportunity to avoid lynching your friend in day 1 - you delayed it by pressuring other people after replace out and by not showing your self distant from FB you kept the opportunity of bussing in day 1.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\n1.Tell me why you think I'm bussing him I explained my behaviour around him and how I handle fire instead you discard that and try to push on.<br>\n2.Not what happened. Already explained why in point 1. Pretty much all of this is a narrative you wrote and there are plenty of other explanations to why I behave in the way I do.  <br>\n<br>\nYou have no reason to actually vote firebringer you went on a bus after a fake scum slip from him you never explained why fire and albert behaved that way around you instead you focus on a full on offensive on me.<br>\n<br>\nThey say the best defense is a good offense", "time": "Fri Jan 22, 2016 2:06 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=64736&start=1500", "forum": "53", "thread": "64736"}
