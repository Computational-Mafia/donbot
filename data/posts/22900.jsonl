With unrelenting rain that never seemed like it was ever going to stop anytime this century, made the ground a muddy, hapless mess that never found time to dry.  And you can bet your money's worth that the temperatures was always cold enough to make the rain freezing as fuck but too chicken-shit to actually go down the few degrees needed so we could at least be blessed with some snow!  The whole thing has made getting a cold yesterdays news- been there, done that yesterday, and </div>still going strong today<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">!   <br>\n<br>\nThe complete works- I never thought the sight of rain would sicken me as much as it does now!<br>\n<br>\n... Where was I again?   <br>\n<br>\nOh yeah!  <br>\n<br>\nLast night was the freaking worst of them all.  <br>\n<br>\nI don't think I've ever heard thunder peal as loud and booming as it did then.  The wind was howling madly as well beneath the downpour of rain that pelted my window.  Ain't no one sleeping with that racket, am I right!?<br>\n<br>\n... Still, I don't think anyone was expecting that come the next morning, that all that noise had only been the perfect cover for the gunshots that undoubtedly rang that night at the Mayor's home.   The screams...<br>\n<br>\nJournal...<br>\n<br>\n... I don't think I've seen so much blood before now, and the whole town seems to be in an uproar at the whole thing, talking about 'old-fashioned mob justice'.  I don't know what to do, but I'm not sure what I find worse- the fact that more killing will ensue if the people who killed the Mayor's family isn't found soon, or the fact that the forecast shows no sign of the sun ever touching our fair town again.<br>\n<br>\n- Midnight</div><br>\n<br>\n==========================================<br>\n<br>\nThe Mayor's Family killed Pregame<br>\n<br>\n==========================================<br>\n* = prods<br>\n<br>\nPlayers alive(Bold=confirmed- 13/13):<br>\n<br>\n2.) <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">McStab</div>- <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#004000\">Vanilla Townie</div></div>.

Town wins!</div></div><br>\n<br>\n-----------------------<br>\n<br>\nRules:<br>\n<br>\n1.) This game goes by Natural Action Resolution<br>\n<br>\n2.) This is a game, which is supposed to be fun and engaging.  So let's keep it as such eh? Keep it civil, no personal attacks please.  That doesn't make a game fun for anyone~<br>\n<br>\n3.) Day phases will last 3 weeks, and Night phase no more than 3 days.  <br>\n<br>\n4.) Expected posting is at least once every 72 hours.  If you don't post in that amount of time, you'll get prodded, and have no more than 48 hours to pick it up and post, before being replaced.  3 prods and you will get forcibly replaced.  <br>\n<br>\n5.) Voting is done like this:  <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: Midnight</div>.   Unvotes are nice, but certainly not required.  I do not count votes unless they are bolded, btw.  Sorry.<br>\n<br>\n6.)  Lynches take half the players living, plus one. Rounded down when needed.  If this does not occur by deadline, then a No-Lynch occurs.  Sorry.<br>\n<br>\n7.) A vote for 'No-Lynch' is acceptable. For 'No-Lynch' to occur, half of the living players must vote for it using this; <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: No-Lynch</div>.<br>\n<br>\n8.) Under no circumstances should anything communicated between you, the player, and me, the mod, by way of PM, QT, or any other form of communication outside the game thread, be quoted anywhere by any means. Modkill on sight.<br>\n<br>\n9.) No outside discussion of this game with players or non-players, or get pummeled to dust as a result.<br>\n<br>\n10.) Once dead, by whatever means, stop posting beyond the single bah post.  If you continue to post, you get turned to 'Neutral Survivor', therefore making it an automatic loss for you, regardless if your team goes on to win.<br>\n<br>\n11.) <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#000040\">Bold Dark Blue</div></div> is my color.  Use it, and get pummeled to dust.   <br>\n<br>\n12.) I will make vote counts as much as I can, probably at least once every two pages. <br>\n<br>\n13.) If I make a mistake, like a wrong vote count or something, please tell me, and I will try to fix it as best I can.  If it's a more serious problem, please keep it to PM, and I will try to sort it to the best of my ability.  <br>\n<br>\n14.)  Flavor- if there is any- has absolutely nothing to do with the game other than being there...  but you knew that already, didn't you?<br>\n<br>\n15.)  Any of the basic/general MafiaScum site rules I may have missed still apply.<br>\n<br>\n16.)  I reserve the right to change/add a rule.  In the event that happens, I will inform you in-game.<br>\n<br>\n==================================================================<br>\n<br>\nSample role:<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Welcome to Mini 1361!  <br>\n<br>\nYou are a <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vanilla Townie</div>.  <br>\n<br>\nYour only power is your mind, voice, and vote. <br>\n<br>\nWin Con: You win when all threats to the Town are history.</div></blockquote>", "time": "Sat Jul 28, 2012 6:55 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=22900&start=0", "forum": "53", "thread": "22900"}

You said I don't 'have anyone'?<br>\n<br>\n-----<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Eidolon wrote:</cite>Oh, what are they telling you? </div></blockquote><br>\nMy observations were these:<br>\na) Eidolon was the first to make a serious vote at what seemed to be RVS.  I didn't understand this vote on PM because PM's post was all joke.  At least it looked like it to me.<br>\nb) When placed under pressure for the first time, in post <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4223774#p4223774\" class=\"postlink\">30</a>, I saw something I considered a minor scumtell.  That was 'If I was scum, why...\" etc.  The first line in your response looked like it was a joke, but it had more serious undertones where you felt you had to defend yourself with a reason that you admitted was WIFOM.  The last line in this post looked weird and gave me bad feelings.<br>\nc) Number <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4224177#p4224177\" class=\"postlink\">45</a>: I noted your transparent speech, saying that you weren't going to lie.  Null, but awkward post.<br>\nd) Post 46 is what set off the scumdar for me.  Your vote, after defending absta in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4224010#p4224010\" class=\"postlink\">37</a>.  And your vote was not for a good reason.  Your vote appeared right after deadjoker's prodding.  I know you SAID that your vote was for lurking, but is there any other reason you voted absta?<br>\ne) Suddenly, I see excellent questions posed to other players which show your observation of the game and your ability to connect dots.  This gave me more of a town read.  One odd thing that struck me was your continual push on absta which was first for lurking, and then built into other reasons.  Which leads me to the question posted in section d.  Was there any other reason you voted absta?<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nRecent posting has led me to believe in an Eidolon town option.  Slandaar, the reason I asked you what you thought of Eidolon's response was that I didn't see you follow up, and it was a question I had for Eidolon as well.  Your response was sufficient.<br>\n---------------------------------<br>\nKonowa's 'I found the scum team' post near the beginning of the post gave me a leaning scum read (because I just did this in a recent game as scum.), but when I reread Kono's iso, I don't see anything major to support my theory.  <br>\n-------------------------------<br>\n<br>\nI'm liking Mcstab as scum right now.<br>\nStuff like this in his iso leads me to a scum conclusion: <br>\n1) Fluff in 20, 26<br>\n2) Hypocritical statement in 39.  You didn't post any thoughts on anything else going on, and you want to call out another player?  Your response in 72 is not sufficient.<br>\n3) An iffy defense of that statement (72).

This is seriously one third of your case, that I posted fluff in my FIRST POST RVS VOTE and then that I mentioned a single off topic thing to Guttersnipe.

Find it funny that he calls twitching a \"scum tell\" and then implies that he started twitching when he thought he was getting lynched. He called slandaar scum after claiming to have used similar reasoning as slandaar which makes him town. Still have a leaning scum read on him.  <br>\n<br>\nCharter: His POV has remained consistent. He's been pushing on peabody this whole time. The one contradiction I find is when he accuses Peabody of being scum for not having reasoning on a wagon when he himself didn't give reasoning either. I'd like him to explain his case on peabody because his main accusations rely on this contradiction. I mean, I understand that he claims it was for pressure, but he's holding different standards for peabody that he is holding for himself. Especially after looking at peabody's iso where he does talk about the absta/me situation. He's been on this wagon this whole time while not providing much of a case, arbitrarily asking people to jump on the wagon.<br>\n<br>\nCharter, can you give your case on peabody?<br>\n<br>\nPeabody: Seems consistent so far. I notice that he wanted a wagon on me over absta just like batman but he explained himself better. His reasoning makes enough sense to where I lean town on him.<br>\n<br>\nNatalie: Gah. I keep going back and forth on this one. On one hand, her POV on her suspicions and her own actions seem consistent enough. On the other hand, with her interaction with me, though she claimed i'm scum, she defended her case and didn't ask me anything or try to pressure me at all. Her original attacks on me were mostly differences in playstyle rather than scum reads. Kind of in the middle right now with her. I actually agree with her analysis on charter fabricating a scum read on her. <br>\n<br>\nYabba: Seems town. though I haven't looked at the meta for his case on charter, I have my own suspicions on Charter that i'd like more clarification on.

To put into context, this was my first post of the game, so I just posted what I thought.  There was no effort to actually attack those on absta's wagon because that was not my focus.  My focus was Eidolon.  It's LAZY scumhunting.  Not FAKE.  As you see, my actual scumhunting was toward the bottom of my post.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>charter wrote:</cite> He reaffirms the faking in post 101, which I go over in 113. </div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nMy post <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4227774#p4227774\" class=\"postlink\">101</a> explains exactly what I said above.

I think my strongest scumreads right now are on Slandaar and Charter.  Slandaar mainly for being really really really active-lurkery, and his over emphasis on meta.  And Charter for over-aggression and thin logic.  He's happy to label just about anyone as scum.<br>\n<br>\nOf the two, I'd lean more towards Absta, and I think lynching Absta is a better idea, simply because there's been so much discussion about him that the flip will tell us a whole lot more.  It's always hard to get a clear picture when you marathon the whole thread like this.  With only a few days to go and so much to digest, I'm not really prepared to deconstruct the whole game at this juncture.  An Absta lynch will tell us a lot.

{"number": 371, "id": "4261819", "user": "Paschendale", "user_id": "14288", "content": "Well, let's talk about Charter, then.  His top suspect seems to be Peabody.  His attacks on Peabody are pretty weak, though.  He claims that Peabody has done \"fake scumhunting.\"  I'm not sure what about his dissection of posts was fake.  He brought up decent points about Eidolon, and his cringe moments about Slandaar and Charter are indeed cringe worthy.  And there's certainly nothing wrong with the notion that a quick growing wagon probably has scum on it.  Half the point of Absta's wagon is to see if it can be used to find scum on it, isn't it?<br>\n<br>\nCharter's original post voting Peabody (71) is in response to mainly a joke.  Peabody wasn't confessing or anything.  And Konowa's accusation wasn't backed up or anything.  It doesn't seem like a reasonable vote to place.  Keep in mind that Charter's previous vote was accompanied by a firm declaration that \"[Absta] is scum.\"  If that was an RVS, he never put a reason to it (an important element in turning RVS stage into real discussion).  And if it was serious, it still lacked a reason, but it paints a picture that Charter will make declarations without backing them up, and then doesn't stand by them.  Why should we listen to him if he just makes pronouncements and gives no reasons?  Sure, he comes back later and talks about it being a pressure vote, but it should still have a reason on it.  His attacks on Peabody are likewise very shallow.<br>\n<br>\nNatalie's criticisms of Charter, especially \"replacing scum would say this and not that\", are pretty solid, too.  Charter's accusation to Natalie/Batman at the time of her replacing in was that if someone is under pressure when they replace, it's \"unquestionably a scumtell.\"  (219)  It's a bit much to believe that town absolutely never replaces out while under pressure.  And if it's as sure a tell as Charter claims, why doesn't he vote?  He makes a lot of pronouncements of scum, but seldom votes to follow up on them.  Withholding votes is something I've always found pretty scummy.  They don't want to be analyzed in relation to a town flip.<br>\n<br>\nCharter's tunneling on Peabody reads, to me, that he wants a a target to rage against, so he can look as if he is hunting scum.  He's avoided any kind of commitment to any other targets, so that he can't come under fire later.  He won't have to justify any other votes and possibly slip up.  But if Peabody does get lynched, no one will accuse him of taking an opportunistic lynch, since he was after it the whole time.  And if Peabody is night killed, probably no one will look at him for very long.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4250265#p4250265\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4250265#p4250265\" data-post-id=\"4250265\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 285</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=7664\">charter</a> wrote:</cite>Absta has been a paragon of inconsistency, but Peabody is voting him. <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":?\" title=\"Confused\"></div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nAnd yet Charter doesn't vote for him...  By throwing himself at Peabody, Charter risks minimal fallout from whatever happens at the end of Day 1.  Even a Peabody lynch with a town flip will be safe for him, since he can attack the hammer and the later votes.  Charter's play is faux aggressive.  He's got himself a very safe position.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4259865#p4259865\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4259865#p4259865\" data-post-id=\"4259865\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 336</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=7664\">charter</a> wrote:</cite>I've caught scum and not letting go.

I don't give a lot of noncommittal comments at others, and end up accusing half the players of being scum.  A lot of Charter's scum accusations are really nothing more than accusing someone of choosing a course of action that is sub-optimal.  Maybe the optimal action isn't really one they can choose.  I know that joining the Absta wagon isn't the best choice.  The best choice is pursuing Slandaar.  But that best choice isn't the best for this situation.  Charter is dealing in a lot of absolutes.  His reasons suggest a rote method of play.  Again, very safe, since it doesn't leave many individual actions to read into.<br>\n<br>\nPEedit:  Gutter, that's hilarious.

Bad play is justifying not hammering someone under the pretense of \"the Mafia will kill me\" but not hammering that person because you know they'll flip town is alignment indicative. Having no defense of you (yet buddying, as you've admitted) is bad play; but deciding to buddy to you is alignment indicative. Not being able to fake scumhunting very well is bad play; not scumhunting is alignment indicative. I agree with you that he's a bad player, but he is to be pursued Day One. <br>\n<br>\nSeriously, think of the benefits:<br>\n<br>\nIf he's town, he's probably the least valuable player on the team.<br>\n<br>\nIf he's scum, which I am 95% convinced he is this game, we know the following:<br>\n<br>\n1.

In this case I would say we are likely dealing with a third mafioso, probably a PR as well (I'm thinking RB). Alternatively, and what would be FAR worse for us, is that an SK exists. If this is the case, we're in a boatload of trouble, because we really have the mafia pool of suspects narrowed down, in my opinion.<br>\n<br>\nAs for the no-kill by mafia, I think it's dependent on the setup. One of these possibilities exists, in my opinion:<br>\n<br>\nPM was the last mafioso, and he, being grossly incompetent, failed to send in a kill last night. Not very likely, in my opinion.<br>\n<br>\nPM was the last mafioso, and he targeted someone who was onto him. If I received doc protection or got jailkept last night, I consider this the most plausible situation.<br>\n<br>\nPM was the last mafioso, and he shot at a protected or NK immune target.<br>\n<br>\nPM wasn't the last mafioso, and given the amount of suspicion on him, the (now last) mafioso tried to kill someone last night: They either got jailkept/RBed, tried to shoot a town BP, tried to shoot a Doc protected player, or hit a BP SK.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nSo, with that in mind, I suggest a Vig come out and claim today if they exist and shot PM last night, so that we can ascertain with some degree of certainty that there is no SK. Any other roles shouldn't claim today, in my opinion.

At the time that I pushed against her wagon, I did so because the case on her was WIFOM at best.  My bracket on her ranged from good town at best to scum at worst.  That is not something I was comfortable with.  Her self destruction during the deadline flurry of posting was not factored into my post pushing against her wagon, and to attempt to connect me defending Natalie with her late game breakdown is disingenuous.<br>\n<br>\nInterestingly enough, the same case that brought down Natalie could also have been made against McStab, who basically stated he wanted to lynch Absta but wanted to give \"Natalie the honors.\"<br>\n<br>\nI'm not surprised I've received the first wagon on D2, I expected it.  I'm the easy D2 lynch.<br>\n<br>\nAs far as who I suspect, at the cost of looking OMGUS, McStab flew out of the gate trying to control the conversation.  I know that if my scumteam had lost two scum before the start of D2 I'd be super aggressive and attempt to steer the wagon to easy people to lynch.  Also, McStab, if you are so certain about my scumminess, why did you agree to put on the breaks when Konowa unvoted and brought me down to L-2?

{"number": 630, "id": "4293880", "user": "McStab", "user_id": "6852", "content": "Ok, so we know we're dealing with an SK now. A four person scumteam in a 13 person game is just too ridiculous to fathom.<br>\n<br>\nTHE GOOD:<br>\n<br>\nWe probably have alot of town PR. I think Konowa hit the nail on the head with Doc/Cop/Vig. Tailor only makes sense with a Cop, and Night One doesn't make that much sense without both a BP SK AND a Doctor (Konowa presumably shot PM; there's far more town motivation than SK motivation to hit the mafia, especially someone who was obviously getting lynched the next day). <br>\n<br>\nTHE BAD:<br>\n<br>\nOur narrow pool of possible suspects is no longer there. There is motivation for SK to hunt Mafia (although I still think we should start by lynching outside that pool; the SK would probably be satisfied with a Pasch lynch Day One instead of a no lynch). <br>\n<br>\nTHE UGLY:<br>\n<br>\nWhat exactly happened Night One? This is my theory: <br>\n<br>\nKonowa killed PM. This part I'm pretty confident on. I doubt the SK tried to kill PM though, because it just doesn't make sense to waste such an easy mislynch. So who did the SK try to kill, and who did the Mafia try to kill?<br>\n<br>\nWell, presumably with a three person mafia team (that should last longer into the game than it did) and a two shot Vig, the SK is Bulletproof (to a certain extent, maybe just one shot or two shot). This means I think the Mafia tried to kill the SK Night One. The Mafia would likely doubt the existence of an SK, though; on Night One there is no reason for them to believe there is an SK, particularly with a three person (and one PR) scumteam. This means I think the Mafia tried to kill one of the townier kind of players. This directly contradicts my earlier point of lynching outside the pool of those who've done the best scumhunting; which is why I'm confused and this is in the ugly column.<br>\n<br>\nThe absence of an SK kill Night One could indicate a doc protection on someone or the SK opting to \"no kill\" (not very likely in my estimation). So I think, regardless of what happened with the Mafia Kill, the person who got doc protected Night One is confirmed non-SK. Alternatively, if the person was JKept, it could be either the SK or his target. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nCan we discuss what everyone thinks of a cop claim (not the protective role that I think must exist, though)? If the cop has two living confirmed innocents, it could be very worth it for him to claim. Even if we only have a Jailkeeper, the Jailkeeper could, say, protect the cop 75% of the time, and then give 12.5% chance of protecting the confirmed innocents instead, thus putting the SK in a bind of taking an unlikely shot on the cop, giving the cop a chance to potentially get an investigation, and protecting the other confirmed innocents. If it's a doc, obviously we protect the cop until we get results.<br>\n<br>\nSo yes, I am for a cop claim, or, if a Jailkeeper exists, even a Jailkeeper claim. If a Jailkeeper exists, he could tell us with certainty that whoever he Jailkept last night isn't the SK.", "time": "Mon Aug 27, 2012 11:05 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=22900&start=625", "forum": "53", "thread": "22900"}

I'll flip VT. Tonight, Peabody will die. Tomorrow, Pasch gets his one shot tonight to investigate someone, which, ASSUMING the SK isn't investigation immune, should confirm one more person as townie, or, if we get a good stroke of luck, we catch the SK. Paschendale will die the next night, at which point we're likely out of PRs (and for god's sake, no one else come out as a PR).<br>\n<br>\nThis means we're likely seeing a playerlist of 4 people with two confirmed town, instead of 3 confirmed town; which is why I wanted the Jailkeeper to stay hidden only ONE more day. But no, everyone's curiosity got the better of their brains. Was my plan perfect? No, but it's much better than us giving the SK our entire setup and gameplan. A lack of information was hurting the SK more than us, because we were actually WINNING at night. I was only for a cop claim at the start of the day to narrow down the suspect list, but this Jailkeeper claim is bad. No one else claim.<br>\n<br>\nPeabody IS quite correct though that there are only four options. The second option makes no sense for a smart SK, the third option is also unlikely simply because non-compulsive SKs aren't very likely, and the fourth option would seem at first glance to be the most probable.<br>\n<br>\nHowever, I would say it is QUITE likely that the Mafia shot me. I was the longest pusher of the Natalie lynch, I started the PM wagon and said I would make sure he was lynched Day Two, and I was leading the town. <br>\n<br>\nAs for the SK, they would want to weaken the town, and, at the risk of sounding arrogant, I came across as the most unlynchable after the end of that day. It's also possible I suspected the SK without knowing it, which would contribute to him trying to shoot me.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nHere is my other main defense, and this enters the realm of \"what I wouldn't do as SK\". Well, for one, I wouldn't be so adamant about changing from Pasch to Nat. I think this argument can be applied to Eidolon as well. Seriously, even if I can't get you all to believe me, please, believe me that I think Eidolon is very likely town, and probably is. People being picky about the Pasch wagon near the end of the day are less and less likely to be scum. The other thing I wouldn't have done as the SK is try to push against deadjoker so early the next day. <br>\n<br>\nThe SK has slim chances of surviving all these lynches and investigations, and as an SK, I would've tried to leave the mafia alive longer. I've also been a paragon of town behaviour ever since the end of Day One. <br>\n<br>\nSomeone pointed out I was discussing the possibility of an SK Day Two. This is because a 2:1:10 setup is far more common, in my experience, than a 3:1:10. Also the power the town was implied to have was incredibly strong. At that stage in the game, a Cop was implied from the Tailor, a doc/JK implied from the lack of Mafia kill, and so I was wondering if we should bother hunting for another mafia member at all. There is far more inclination to think a 2:1:10 setup than a 3:1:9 setup, and I had no idea there was a Vig.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nI doubt my defense will mean much, and because most of you will say \"The chances of both Mafia and SK trying to hit McStab Night One are slimmer than the chance of McStab being the SK\", I will likely be lynched today. <br>\n<br>\nNo one else should out themselves as a PR. Seriously, outing the JK because everyone is curious is what will have been what cost us the game if we lose. Did no one decide to figure out that if the JK gets one more night we've broken the setup (assuming the SK isn't investigation immune)?<br>\n<br>\nFor what it's worth, yabba and Gutter should get investigated tonight. Make sure that both of you coordinate your investigation tonight so there is no overlap, and lynch the one who doesn't get confirmed. I think it far less likely that Eidolon or charter are the SK due to their last minute switch from Pasch, Pasch and Peabody are PRs, I know I'm innocent (and will most likely be lynched today to prove it), and absta is confirmed innocent. That means we need to investigate and lynch out of the pool of Gutter/yabba at first; if those prove fruitless, I'm not sure where to go. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: yabba</div>", "time": "Tue Aug 28, 2012 11:35 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=22900&start=650", "forum": "53", "thread": "22900"}

It would've worked finer if we could mitigate the risk of the Jailkeeper dying for one extra night and get the final confirmed town, but our pure probability odds should work out in our favor. The SK can't do any weird gambits tonight. Absolute worst case we're in LyLo with 50% of town confirmed and a 50-50 shot at catching the last scum. Best case scenario the Jailkeeper catches scum before that....<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nwhich brings me to my next point. Although a Jailkeeper action would confirm me, I would rather be copped. I know I'm a VT 100%. This means that there is 0% chance the JK will prevent the SK from performing the kill tonight. So, with that in mind, I cannot, in all honesty, advocate that I be jailkept, as it reduces (however minimally) the chances of the JK catching scum tonight and preventing the kill altogether.<br>\n<br>\nThat being said, I understand that I need to be confirmed or I'll be lynched. I would ask the cop investigate me instead of me being Jailkept.

And no, it doesn't make sense; if the SK no kills tonight, it buys the PRs an extra night at my expense, while also putting us back at an odd number, which gives us an extra day into LyLo. <br>\n<br>\nHow come you think we'd miss the SK lynch today? Also, until he kills a PR, we're winning at Nights. We're producing two confirmed town every night. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\nIf he no kills, THIS IS GREAT. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\nAlso regardless of what happens, the JK needs to announce who he's investigating and Pasch, you should investigate someone else. Just want to clarify that.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nWhy am I not a shining beacon target for the SK and Mafia Night One? I tried pushing a PM wagon six hours before deadline, and then kept up pressure on Nat. I was unlynchable at that time, a threat to both SK and Mafia.<br>\n<br>\nWe lynch today, I get jailkept overnight (I'd prefer a cop, but if you all insist I don't really care). If a kill happens, I'm confirmed innocent, and can continue being useful to the town. If a no kill happens, then the PRs have an extra night, we have an extra lynch before LyLo (on a smaller pool, too) and you can continue to block me while the cop produces confirmed innocents (if I was the SK).<br>\n<br>\nI'll admit that Night One is only explainable if I was either the target of the Mafia (and SK) or I was the SK. But there are very compelling reasons to believe I was the target of one or both. I've been helpful ALL game to the town, and led lynches on two mafia members. My use, in scumhunting, this game, has far superseded that of yabba or Guttersnipe. If you lynch me today, you risk losing that, when you could just confirm me, as opposed to lynching someone who is NOT helpful to the town, regardless of alignment.<br>\n<br>\nSo to recap:<br>\n<br>\nI can be confirmed tonight. Contrary to popular opinion, a no-kill buys us an extra lynch and the PRs an extra investigation. If the SK sacrifices that just to frame me, I'm honored.<br>\n<br>\nI am far more useful confirmed than yabba or Guttersnipe would be.

The reason why? They're in exactly the position they're in now, surrounded by town and PRs and having to dodge mislynches.<br>\n<br>\nPlus, an SK wouldn't care about explicitly lynching Mafia. They would want to lynch Town too. Why bother trying to push a last minute lynch on Natalie or PM when Paschendale is sitting at L-1 waiting for a last minute hammer?<br>\n<br>\nAlso, I don't know how this logic got so pervasive throughout the site, but wanting to survive is playing to your wincondition. You're the only person you can know is town with 100% certainty (although others can reach 99%). I know it doesn't help the town catch the SK by me dying. I also know that it's a dumb lynch, because there's NO LOGIC to my lynch.<br>\n<br>\nSeriously, the case on me is some heavy duty Spanish Inquisition shit. I'm branded scum because a Protective Role/Roleblocker combo targeted me Night One and there was a missing NightKill (or two). Actually, I want Peabody to explain why he chose to target me Night One. Was it because I was so obviously pro-town? In that case, are you all that surprised I got targeted by scum? Anyhow, one piece of hardly slam-dunk evidence gets thrown at me, and all of a sudden a player who pushed harder on scum and farther away from town (The last point in particular is important; I defended against the Paschendale lynch vehemently, no SK would do that) is getting quicklynched? Then when I defend myself and show how weak the argument is against me I get branded Serial Killer for trying not to get lynched.<br>\n<br>\nNewsflash: Me getting lynched doesn't help catch the SK. So I'm going to fight it. This isn't alignment indicative, because an SK would fight against it as well. But if your standard behaviour when accused of being scum as townie is to lie down and take it (what you did, essentially) then you're playing poor as a townie. Would you sit there and not argue when an Innocent Child is about to get lynched? Well, every player knows themselves to be an Innocent Child, so they should fight to not get themselves lynched (barring being a Jester).<br>\n<br>\nMy behaviour near death is actually helpful to town; yours almost cost us an early Day One which was only salvaged because people stopped being lazy (myself, Eidolon and charter in particular) and decided to push a lynch on a real scum target.", "time": "Wed Aug 29, 2012 5:24 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=22900&start=725", "forum": "53", "thread": "22900"}

They'll help him later.  And one dead scum won't put him in particular danger of facing town alone.  On night 1, PM and DJ target him for a nightkill, since he's been so pro-town.

Present a way it's harmful to stick with my plan. You can't. <br>\n<br>\nTown, we have WON this game. Lynch Charter, RC, and, if it somehow comes to her, Eidolon. We win. This gameplan is the one that guarantees victory. Jail me everynight while Pasch investigates. It forces the SK to continue no killing till they ger lynched by following MY plan or to kill, thus confirming me as innocent.<br>\n<br>\nDon't skimp out on a game breaking strategy because you want to take a chance on ending the game early.", "time": "Mon Sep 03, 2012 7:11 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=22900&start=850", "forum": "53", "thread": "22900"}
