With unrelenting rain that never seemed like it was ever going to stop anytime this century, made the ground a muddy, hapless mess that never found time to dry.  And you can bet your money's worth that the temperatures was always cold enough to make the rain freezing as fuck but too chicken-shit to actually go down the few degrees needed so we could at least be blessed with some snow!  The whole thing has made getting a cold yesterdays news- been there, done that yesterday, and </span>still going strong today<span style=\"font-style: italic\">!   <br><br>The complete works- I never thought the sight of rain would sicken me as much as it does now!<br><br>...

Still, I don't think anyone was expecting that come the next morning, that all that noise had only been the perfect cover for the gunshots that undoubtedly rang that night at the Mayor's home.   The screams...<br><br>Journal...<br><br>... I don't think I've seen so much blood before now, and the whole town seems to be in an uproar at the whole thing, talking about 'old-fashioned mob justice'.  I don't know what to do, but I'm not sure what I find worse- the fact that more killing will ensue if the people who killed the Mayor's family isn't found soon, or the fact that the forecast shows no sign of the sun ever touching our fair town again.<br><br>- Midnight</span><br><br>==========================================<br><br>The Mayor's Family killed Pregame<br><br>==========================================<br>* = prods<br><br>Players alive(Bold=confirmed- 13/13):<br><br>2.) <span class=\"noboldsig\">McStab</span>- <span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #004000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Vanilla Townie</span></span></span>.

Town wins!</span></span></span><br><br>-----------------------<br><br>Rules:<br><br>1.) This game goes by Natural Action Resolution<br><br>2.) This is a game, which is supposed to be fun and engaging.  So let's keep it as such eh? Keep it civil, no personal attacks please.  That doesn't make a game fun for anyone~<br><br>3.) Day phases will last 3 weeks, and Night phase no more than 3 days.  <br><br>4.) Expected posting is at least once every 72 hours.  If you don't post in that amount of time, you'll get prodded, and have no more than 48 hours to pick it up and post, before being replaced.  3 prods and you will get forcibly replaced.  <br><br>5.) Voting is done like this:  <span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: Midnight</span>.   Unvotes are nice, but certainly not required.  I do not count votes unless they are bolded, btw.  Sorry.<br><br>6.)  Lynches take half the players living, plus one. Rounded down when needed.  If this does not occur by deadline, then a No-Lynch occurs.  Sorry.<br><br>7.) A vote for 'No-Lynch' is acceptable. For 'No-Lynch' to occur, half of the living players must vote for it using this; <span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: No-Lynch</span>.<br><br>8.) Under no circumstances should anything communicated between you, the player, and me, the mod, by way of PM, QT, or any other form of communication outside the game thread, be quoted anywhere by any means. Modkill on sight.<br><br>9.) No outside discussion of this game with players or non-players, or get pummeled to dust as a result.<br><br>10.) Once dead, by whatever means, stop posting beyond the single bah post.  If you continue to post, you get turned to 'Neutral Survivor', therefore making it an automatic loss for you, regardless if your team goes on to win.<br><br>11.) <span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #000040\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Bold Dark Blue</span></span></span> is my color.  Use it, and get pummeled to dust.   <br><br>12.) I will make vote counts as much as I can, probably at least once every two pages. <br><br>13.) If I make a mistake, like a wrong vote count or something, please tell me, and I will try to fix it as best I can.  If it's a more serious problem, please keep it to PM, and I will try to sort it to the best of my ability.  <br><br>14.)  Flavor- if there is any- has absolutely nothing to do with the game other than being there...  but you knew that already, didn't you?<br><br>15.)  Any of the basic/general MafiaScum site rules I may have missed still apply.<br><br>16.)  I reserve the right to change/add a rule.  In the event that happens, I will inform you in-game.<br><br>==================================================================<br><br>Sample role:<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Welcome to Mini 1361!  <br><br>You are a <span class=\"noboldsig\">Vanilla Townie</span>.  <br><br>Your only power is your mind, voice, and vote. <br><br>Win Con: You win when all threats to the Town are history.</div></blockquote>"}

You said I don't 'have anyone'?<br><br>-----<br><blockquote><div><cite>Eidolon wrote:</cite>Oh, what are they telling you? </div></blockquote><br>My observations were these:<br>a) Eidolon was the first to make a serious vote at what seemed to be RVS.  I didn't understand this vote on PM because PM's post was all joke.  At least it looked like it to me.<br>b) When placed under pressure for the first time, in post <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4223774#p4223774\" class=\"postlink\">30</a>, I saw something I considered a minor scumtell.  That was 'If I was scum, why...\" etc.  The first line in your response looked like it was a joke, but it had more serious undertones where you felt you had to defend yourself with a reason that you admitted was WIFOM.  The last line in this post looked weird and gave me bad feelings.<br>c) Number <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4224177#p4224177\" class=\"postlink\">45</a>: I noted your transparent speech, saying that you weren't going to lie.  Null, but awkward post.<br>d) Post 46 is what set off the scumdar for me.  Your vote, after defending absta in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4224010#p4224010\" class=\"postlink\">37</a>.  And your vote was not for a good reason.  Your vote appeared right after deadjoker's prodding.  I know you SAID that your vote was for lurking, but is there any other reason you voted absta?<br>e) Suddenly, I see excellent questions posed to other players which show your observation of the game and your ability to connect dots.  This gave me more of a town read.  One odd thing that struck me was your continual push on absta which was first for lurking, and then built into other reasons.  Which leads me to the question posted in section d.  Was there any other reason you voted absta?<br><br><br>Recent posting has led me to believe in an Eidolon town option.  Slandaar, the reason I asked you what you thought of Eidolon's response was that I didn't see you follow up, and it was a question I had for Eidolon as well.  Your response was sufficient.<br>---------------------------------<br>Konowa's 'I found the scum team' post near the beginning of the post gave me a leaning scum read (because I just did this in a recent game as scum.), but when I reread Kono's iso, I don't see anything major to support my theory.  <br>-------------------------------<br><br>I'm liking Mcstab as scum right now.<br>Stuff like this in his iso leads me to a scum conclusion: <br>1) Fluff in 20, 26<br>2) Hypocritical statement in 39.  You didn't post any thoughts on anything else going on, and you want to call out another player?  Your response in 72 is not sufficient.<br>3) An iffy defense of that statement (72).  I want to hear McStab's answer to my question #2.<br><br>Very little scumhunting.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">unvote; vote McStab</span>"}

That I was sheeping a great wagon on two scummy players during RVS stage?

It's not a defense, it's the logical conclusion. Tell me, why would someone be buddying up to someone? Is it town trying to find scum by trusting another player (this is sarcastic, just in case you don't get it). The only reason buddying happens is scum trying to get town on their side.

(what an awesome feature) I'll just post my general consensus on each person I do an iso on.<br><br>Absta: His play is just all over the place, calls people scum, gives very snappy defensive. Find it funny that he calls twitching a \"scum tell\" and then implies that he started twitching when he thought he was getting lynched. He called slandaar scum after claiming to have used similar reasoning as slandaar which makes him town. Still have a leaning scum read on him.  <br><br>Charter: His POV has remained consistent. He's been pushing on peabody this whole time. The one contradiction I find is when he accuses Peabody of being scum for not having reasoning on a wagon when he himself didn't give reasoning either. I'd like him to explain his case on peabody because his main accusations rely on this contradiction. I mean, I understand that he claims it was for pressure, but he's holding different standards for peabody that he is holding for himself. Especially after looking at peabody's iso where he does talk about the absta/me situation. He's been on this wagon this whole time while not providing much of a case, arbitrarily asking people to jump on the wagon.<br><br>Charter, can you give your case on peabody?<br><br>Peabody: Seems consistent so far. I notice that he wanted a wagon on me over absta just like batman but he explained himself better. His reasoning makes enough sense to where I lean town on him.<br><br>Natalie: Gah. I keep going back and forth on this one. On one hand, her POV on her suspicions and her own actions seem consistent enough. On the other hand, with her interaction with me, though she claimed i'm scum, she defended her case and didn't ask me anything or try to pressure me at all. Her original attacks on me were mostly differences in playstyle rather than scum reads. Kind of in the middle right now with her. I actually agree with her analysis on charter fabricating a scum read on her. <br><br>Yabba: Seems town. though I haven't looked at the meta for his case on charter, I have my own suspicions on Charter that i'd like more clarification on. So<span class=\"noboldsig\"> unvote, Vote Charter.</span> I don't really like joining a wagon with someone who i feel is slightly scummy (natalie), but we'll see how it goes.<br><br>Everyone else, I've already gotten town reads on, so I'll leave them alone for now, but I will be open to reevaluating if there is enough evidence against them."}

Please, don't patronize me with your amateur and terrible psychoanalysis. <br><br>You flatter yourself far too much. My first two posts are exactly what I said, nothing more. If I was trying to blend in I would've done an RVS vote on someone else, not voted myself. So there, even the weak proposition you base your conclusions on from my first two posts are flawed. I wanted to keep the pressure up on absta because I wanted a wagon to get out of RVS. This is called a \"pressure wagon\". You may have heard of it if you are familiar with scumhunting.<br><br>If you can't think of why a townie would want people to listen to their opinions and then act upon them, then you're either incredibly uncertain with your scum tells or you're dumb. Obviously, if one is confident in who the scum are, they want others to listen to them. This is elementary logic.<br><br>Finally, as another flaw in your logic, you just claimed that I'm mislynched fairly often as a townie. While this is incorrect (I don't think I'm mislynched more often than anyone else would be), your proposition holds that if I appear scummy to you in this game, it is part of my meta as both VT and scum. Therefore you're voting for someone who you acknowledge appears scummy to you as a townie."}

My focus was Eidolon.  It's LAZY scumhunting.  Not FAKE.

Instead of trying to look for obvscum (there aren't any) and being overly worried about hitting a town (which is probably going to happen no matter how long this day goes), create a bracket.  That bracket, for me, ranges from bad town to scum.  A couple of players fall into this category, including the person I am voting for.

This puts him squarely in bad town for me with a decent chance of being scum.  Even if he is town, his is so easily manipulated he will likely end up voting for targets scum want to take out.

I've rarely seen a scum hit D1, and obsessing over hitting scum (and paranoid about hitting town) leads to a situation we are in right now.<br><br>Don't misinterpret this into me saying we shouldn't be scum hunting.  Instead of trying to look for obvscum (there aren't any) and being overly worried about hitting a town (which is probably going to happen no matter how long this day goes), create a bracket.  That bracket, for me, ranges from bad town to scum.  A couple of players fall into this category, including the person I am voting for.  That way at the very worst, D1 we are removing a bad town, getting a lot of reads for D2.  Town does not win D1, it wins D2 or D3 onward.<br><br>Gutter you said that absta is a lazy man wagon.  I could not disagree more.  Absta constantly vote switches, rarely provides reasoning, gets emotional about attacks, and cannot provide any form of a basic defense for himself.  This puts him squarely in bad town for me with a decent chance of being scum.  Even if he is town, his is so easily manipulated he will likely end up voting for targets scum want to take out.  My vote is staying on him, the only other person who falls into this category is charter, but my bad town/scum read on him is much, much weaker.</div></blockquote><br><br>Deadjoker, I agree with you in the sense that I think a Day One lynch that helps us narrow down the suspect pool later should be our top priority at this point. Between Peabody, absta, charter Eidolon and Batman/Natalie, I think any one of them could be scum (not together, but by individual merit). <br><br>I think that the first day lynch should be focused on Natalie/Batman though. I think her flip would help verify alot of people's alignments (a Nat scum flip, for example, would go a long way towards clearing Guttersnipe and myself). I can settle on any of the ones I listed, but I think Nat/Batman or absta would be the two most informative in terms of determining other people's flips."}

I think my strongest scumreads right now are on Slandaar and Charter.  Slandaar mainly for being really really really active-lurkery, and his over emphasis on meta.  And Charter for over-aggression and thin logic.  He's happy to label just about anyone as scum.<br><br>Of the two, I'd lean more towards Absta, and I think lynching Absta is a better idea, simply because there's been so much discussion about him that the flip will tell us a whole lot more.  It's always hard to get a clear picture when you marathon the whole thread like this.  With only a few days to go and so much to digest, I'm not really prepared to deconstruct the whole game at this juncture.  An Absta lynch will tell us a lot.

His top suspect seems to be Peabody.  His attacks on Peabody are pretty weak, though.  He claims that Peabody has done \"fake scumhunting.\"  I'm not sure what about his dissection of posts was fake.  He brought up decent points about Eidolon, and his cringe moments about Slandaar and Charter are indeed cringe worthy.  And there's certainly nothing wrong with the notion that a quick growing wagon probably has scum on it.  Half the point of Absta's wagon is to see if it can be used to find scum on it, isn't it?<br><br>Charter's original post voting Peabody (71) is in response to mainly a joke.  Peabody wasn't confessing or anything.  And Konowa's accusation wasn't backed up or anything.  It doesn't seem like a reasonable vote to place.  Keep in mind that Charter's previous vote was accompanied by a firm declaration that \"[Absta] is scum.\"  If that was an RVS, he never put a reason to it (an important element in turning RVS stage into real discussion).  And if it was serious, it still lacked a reason, but it paints a picture that Charter will make declarations without backing them up, and then doesn't stand by them.  Why should we listen to him if he just makes pronouncements and gives no reasons?  Sure, he comes back later and talks about it being a pressure vote, but it should still have a reason on it.  His attacks on Peabody are likewise very shallow.<br><br>Natalie's criticisms of Charter, especially \"replacing scum would say this and not that\", are pretty solid, too.  Charter's accusation to Natalie/Batman at the time of her replacing in was that if someone is under pressure when they replace, it's \"unquestionably a scumtell.\"  (219)  It's a bit much to believe that town absolutely never replaces out while under pressure.  And if it's as sure a tell as Charter claims, why doesn't he vote?  He makes a lot of pronouncements of scum, but seldom votes to follow up on them.  Withholding votes is something I've always found pretty scummy.  They don't want to be analyzed in relation to a town flip.<br><br>Charter's tunneling on Peabody reads, to me, that he wants a a target to rage against, so he can look as if he is hunting scum.  He's avoided any kind of commitment to any other targets, so that he can't come under fire later.  He won't have to justify any other votes and possibly slip up.  But if Peabody does get lynched, no one will accuse him of taking an opportunistic lynch, since he was after it the whole time.  And if Peabody is night killed, probably no one will look at him for very long.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4250265#p4250265\" class=\"postlink\">post 285</a>, charter wrote:</cite>Absta has been a paragon of inconsistency, but Peabody is voting him. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif\" alt=\":?\" title=\"Confused\"></div></blockquote><br><br>And yet Charter doesn't vote for him...  By throwing himself at Peabody, Charter risks minimal fallout from whatever happens at the end of Day 1.  Even a Peabody lynch with a town flip will be safe for him, since he can attack the hammer and the later votes.  Charter's play is faux aggressive.  He's got himself a very safe position.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4259865#p4259865\" class=\"postlink\">post 336</a>, charter wrote:</cite>I've caught scum and not letting go.  Peabody is just along for the ride, he doesn't really care where he goes.</div></blockquote><br><br>I don't know about anyone else, but when I'm really sure about my target, and not a lot of others agree, I keep refining my arguments, trying to prove my theory correct.  I don't give a lot of noncommittal comments at others, and end up accusing half the players of being scum.  A lot of Charter's scum accusations are really nothing more than accusing someone of choosing a course of action that is sub-optimal.  Maybe the optimal action isn't really one they can choose.  I know that joining the Absta wagon isn't the best choice.  The best choice is pursuing Slandaar.  But that best choice isn't the best for this situation.  Charter is dealing in a lot of absolutes.  His reasons suggest a rote method of play.  Again, very safe, since it doesn't leave many individual actions to read into.<br><br>PEedit:  Gutter, that's hilarious.  Flips are worthless?  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"Laughing\"><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4261782#p4261782\" class=\"postlink\">post 367</a>, Natalie wrote:</cite>No, I think you are scummy, but I'm not just going to blindly hop over to a PM wagon when yours is more useful.<br><br>Absta's wagon not going through worries me....</div></blockquote><br><br>Your vote is still on Charter.  You could have hammered before Konowa switched.  Apparently it doesn't worry you that much.<br><br>I think Charter is a much better lynch than Absta, since I actually think Charter is scummy, whereas Absta's lynch is just the most contested.  When I said I wasn't sure about five days being enough, I didn't have a feel for the pace of this particular game yet.  If five days is enough, than so be it.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Unvote<br>Vote: Charter</span><br><br>Looks like you lost your chance, Natalie.

PM was an exception, but he was so obv scum to everyone that I highly doubt anyone else on the Nat wagon were mafia, or else it would've shown up as obvious. <br><br>As for only one kill last night:<br><br>Someone could claim vig and that they shot PM. In this case I would say we are likely dealing with a third mafioso, probably a PR as well (I'm thinking RB). Alternatively, and what would be FAR worse for us, is that an SK exists. If this is the case, we're in a boatload of trouble, because we really have the mafia pool of suspects narrowed down, in my opinion.<br><br>As for the no-kill by mafia, I think it's dependent on the setup. One of these possibilities exists, in my opinion:<br><br>PM was the last mafioso, and he, being grossly incompetent, failed to send in a kill last night. Not very likely, in my opinion.<br><br>PM was the last mafioso, and he targeted someone who was onto him. If I received doc protection or got jailkept last night, I consider this the most plausible situation.<br><br>PM was the last mafioso, and he shot at a protected or NK immune target.<br><br>PM wasn't the last mafioso, and given the amount of suspicion on him, the (now last) mafioso tried to kill someone last night: They either got jailkept/RBed, tried to shoot a town BP, tried to shoot a Doc protected player, or hit a BP SK.<br><br><br><br>So, with that in mind, I suggest a Vig come out and claim today if they exist and shot PM last night, so that we can ascertain with some degree of certainty that there is no SK. Any other roles shouldn't claim today, in my opinion. There are far too many possibilities and I doubt any protective role could say with certainty at this stage whether or not someone is conf. innocent. The only other reason I can see a claim is that if there is an investigative role with a good reason to believe they have caught a mafioso or SK."}

I'm not denying that I didn't want to lynch her.  At the time that I pushed against her wagon, I did so because the case on her was WIFOM at best.

Her self destruction during the deadline flurry of posting was not factored into my post pushing against her wagon, and to attempt to connect me defending Natalie with her late game breakdown is disingenuous.<br><br>Interestingly enough, the same case that brought down Natalie could also have been made against McStab, who basically stated he wanted to lynch Absta but wanted to give \"Natalie the honors.\"<br><br>I'm not surprised I've received the first wagon on D2, I expected it.

I know that if my scumteam had lost two scum before the start of D2 I'd be super aggressive and attempt to steer the wagon to easy people to lynch.  Also, McStab, if you are so certain about my scumminess, why did you agree to put on the breaks when Konowa unvoted and brought me down to L-2?  That makes no sense.<br><br>Pasch's character slamming of me saying I don't back up my votes is probably the most manipulative thing I've seen on my wagon.

A four person scumteam in a 13 person game is just too ridiculous to fathom.<br><br>THE GOOD:<br><br>We probably have alot of town PR. I think Konowa hit the nail on the head with Doc/Cop/Vig. Tailor only makes sense with a Cop, and Night One doesn't make that much sense without both a BP SK AND a Doctor (Konowa presumably shot PM; there's far more town motivation than SK motivation to hit the mafia, especially someone who was obviously getting lynched the next day). <br><br>THE BAD:<br><br>Our narrow pool of possible suspects is no longer there. There is motivation for SK to hunt Mafia (although I still think we should start by lynching outside that pool; the SK would probably be satisfied with a Pasch lynch Day One instead of a no lynch). <br><br>THE UGLY:<br><br>What exactly happened Night One? This is my theory: <br><br>Konowa killed PM. This part I'm pretty confident on. I doubt the SK tried to kill PM though, because it just doesn't make sense to waste such an easy mislynch. So who did the SK try to kill, and who did the Mafia try to kill?<br><br>Well, presumably with a three person mafia team (that should last longer into the game than it did) and a two shot Vig, the SK is Bulletproof (to a certain extent, maybe just one shot or two shot). This means I think the Mafia tried to kill the SK Night One. The Mafia would likely doubt the existence of an SK, though; on Night One there is no reason for them to believe there is an SK, particularly with a three person (and one PR) scumteam. This means I think the Mafia tried to kill one of the townier kind of players. This directly contradicts my earlier point of lynching outside the pool of those who've done the best scumhunting; which is why I'm confused and this is in the ugly column.<br><br>The absence of an SK kill Night One could indicate a doc protection on someone or the SK opting to \"no kill\" (not very likely in my estimation). So I think, regardless of what happened with the Mafia Kill, the person who got doc protected Night One is confirmed non-SK. Alternatively, if the person was JKept, it could be either the SK or his target. <br><br><br><br>Can we discuss what everyone thinks of a cop claim (not the protective role that I think must exist, though)? If the cop has two living confirmed innocents, it could be very worth it for him to claim. Even if we only have a Jailkeeper, the Jailkeeper could, say, protect the cop 75% of the time, and then give 12.5% chance of protecting the confirmed innocents instead, thus putting the SK in a bind of taking an unlikely shot on the cop, giving the cop a chance to potentially get an investigation, and protecting the other confirmed innocents. If it's a doc, obviously we protect the cop until we get results.<br><br>So yes, I am for a cop claim, or, if a Jailkeeper exists, even a Jailkeeper claim. If a Jailkeeper exists, he could tell us with certainty that whoever he Jailkept last night isn't the SK."}

I'll flip VT. Tonight, Peabody will die. Tomorrow, Pasch gets his one shot tonight to investigate someone, which, ASSUMING the SK isn't investigation immune, should confirm one more person as townie, or, if we get a good stroke of luck, we catch the SK. Paschendale will die the next night, at which point we're likely out of PRs (and for god's sake, no one else come out as a PR).<br><br>This means we're likely seeing a playerlist of 4 people with two confirmed town, instead of 3 confirmed town; which is why I wanted the Jailkeeper to stay hidden only ONE more day. But no, everyone's curiosity got the better of their brains. Was my plan perfect? No, but it's much better than us giving the SK our entire setup and gameplan. A lack of information was hurting the SK more than us, because we were actually WINNING at night. I was only for a cop claim at the start of the day to narrow down the suspect list, but this Jailkeeper claim is bad. No one else claim.<br><br>Peabody IS quite correct though that there are only four options. The second option makes no sense for a smart SK, the third option is also unlikely simply because non-compulsive SKs aren't very likely, and the fourth option would seem at first glance to be the most probable.<br><br>However, I would say it is QUITE likely that the Mafia shot me. I was the longest pusher of the Natalie lynch, I started the PM wagon and said I would make sure he was lynched Day Two, and I was leading the town. <br><br>As for the SK, they would want to weaken the town, and, at the risk of sounding arrogant, I came across as the most unlynchable after the end of that day. It's also possible I suspected the SK without knowing it, which would contribute to him trying to shoot me.<br><br><br>Here is my other main defense, and this enters the realm of \"what I wouldn't do as SK\". Well, for one, I wouldn't be so adamant about changing from Pasch to Nat. I think this argument can be applied to Eidolon as well. Seriously, even if I can't get you all to believe me, please, believe me that I think Eidolon is very likely town, and probably is. People being picky about the Pasch wagon near the end of the day are less and less likely to be scum. The other thing I wouldn't have done as the SK is try to push against deadjoker so early the next day. <br><br>The SK has slim chances of surviving all these lynches and investigations, and as an SK, I would've tried to leave the mafia alive longer. I've also been a paragon of town behaviour ever since the end of Day One. <br><br>Someone pointed out I was discussing the possibility of an SK Day Two. This is because a 2:1:10 setup is far more common, in my experience, than a 3:1:10. Also the power the town was implied to have was incredibly strong. At that stage in the game, a Cop was implied from the Tailor, a doc/JK implied from the lack of Mafia kill, and so I was wondering if we should bother hunting for another mafia member at all. There is far more inclination to think a 2:1:10 setup than a 3:1:9 setup, and I had no idea there was a Vig.<br><br><br>I doubt my defense will mean much, and because most of you will say \"The chances of both Mafia and SK trying to hit McStab Night One are slimmer than the chance of McStab being the SK\", I will likely be lynched today. <br><br>No one else should out themselves as a PR. Seriously, outing the JK because everyone is curious is what will have been what cost us the game if we lose. Did no one decide to figure out that if the JK gets one more night we've broken the setup (assuming the SK isn't investigation immune)?<br><br>For what it's worth, yabba and Gutter should get investigated tonight. Make sure that both of you coordinate your investigation tonight so there is no overlap, and lynch the one who doesn't get confirmed. I think it far less likely that Eidolon or charter are the SK due to their last minute switch from Pasch, Pasch and Peabody are PRs, I know I'm innocent (and will most likely be lynched today to prove it), and absta is confirmed innocent. That means we need to investigate and lynch out of the pool of Gutter/yabba at first; if those prove fruitless, I'm not sure where to go. <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: yabba</span>"}

It would've worked finer if we could mitigate the risk of the Jailkeeper dying for one extra night and get the final confirmed town, but our pure probability odds should work out in our favor. The SK can't do any weird gambits tonight. Absolute worst case we're in LyLo with 50% of town confirmed and a 50-50 shot at catching the last scum. Best case scenario the Jailkeeper catches scum before that....<br><br><br>which brings me to my next point. Although a Jailkeeper action would confirm me, I would rather be copped. I know I'm a VT 100%. This means that there is 0% chance the JK will prevent the SK from performing the kill tonight. So, with that in mind, I cannot, in all honesty, advocate that I be jailkept, as it reduces (however minimally) the chances of the JK catching scum tonight and preventing the kill altogether.<br><br>That being said, I understand that I need to be confirmed or I'll be lynched. I would ask the cop investigate me instead of me being Jailkept. I will submit if they deny me the request (over fears of investigation immunity) but ultimately I'd be hurting the town to request a Jailkeeping instead of a Copping. So, I want to be copped. Anyone have problems with that? <br><br>Interesting how you've really picked up after all this pressure, yabba. Especially because you were hesitant to vote for me until I started attacking you, at which point you kicked the attacks on me into overdrive."}

But there are very compelling reasons to believe I was the target of one or both. I've been helpful ALL game to the town, and led lynches on two mafia members. My use, in scumhunting, this game, has far superseded that of yabba or Guttersnipe. If you lynch me today, you risk losing that, when you could just confirm me, as opposed to lynching someone who is NOT helpful to the town, regardless of alignment.<br><br>So to recap:<br><br>I can be confirmed tonight.

The setup was swingy as hell, I fwlt as though we were in a rough spot (and we would've been if Pasch hadn't investigated me as opposed to RC. I really liked the way it played out but it was a close run thing even after three dead mafia, and the town PRs were definitely weakened by Tailor/investigation immune SK plus one shot BP. <br><br>Good job RC, trying to salvage the situation. Great job to town too; the last minute lynch pushes on scum, Konowa's vigging, Pasch and Peabody's nightwork and everyone's reluctance to lynch me despite all of the SK pushes to the contrary really earned town a great victory. <br><br>Sorry if my survival efforts made anyone mad or I insulted anyone. I wanted to pull out all the stops after three dead mafia; losing after calling out and successfully lynching all three members of the scumteam just disn't sit right with me. Thanks for the game Midnight!"}
