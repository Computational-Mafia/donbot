I will when the game will advance and if I won't be lynched, but not right now.<br><br>I don't like Mulch's play at all. Most of the posts are quite simple and empty, everyone who looks at him says he's newbie and tr's him. Actually, being newbie!scum is the easiest thing to do ever, because if you do something suspicious and strange like flailing, weak reasoning, etc. you may always say you're newbie and people will say, well, yeah, it works. There is, of course a problem that you may still be a town!newbie with all that stuff, but I don't buy it. <br><br>Firescreamer lurking for some time and coming into game aggressively and textwally after called for it is scummy imo.<br><br>Gut says Ryker is scum. OMGUS, you'll say, but no, actually. I was thinking so while rereading not seeing then that I have a wagon. I just read through Ryker's ISO and can't find a single thing to look into really.

I don't see it.<br><br>This<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9213444#p9213444\" class=\"postlink\">post 476</a>, Ryker wrote:</cite>Wait, who the fuck is FireScreamer?<br><br>Have they posted?</div></blockquote><br><br>Is the PERFECT example of distancing. I mean well, you have a lot of people to analyze, do you say they're all townie so you look into someone else to analyze? No one does that. Make a case and advance it, this post above doesn't do anything other than distracting attention to the player.<br><br>And it doesn't matter that that player reacted scummily. You can both be scum.<br><br><br>D1 from my experience is a little worse than D2 but still the best time to distance yourself from your partners. I still can't believe it was that easy in 1903, when I made like 5 posts about how rb is scummy, he's made couple of posts about how I am scummy, I made a post like \"who's creature\" (Creature, rb, me were scumbuddies) and in the end it all worked out. I am saying, you should never say things like Zulfy vs Mulch because they may try to distance each other. But time and flips will tell.<br><br>Now I am perfectly comfortable with <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Ryker</span> and I think you all should be too."}

Agent Sparkles is asked a good question by Lalight, and takes a long while to answer. This is another example of his lack of follow up. He is content with dropping his vote on Lalight without any extra analysis. I also don't really see much questioning towards Frozen Flame who he says he would be looking into.<br><br>He lacks the motivation to follow up with his suspicions, and he seems to randomly just get quiet after a bit. It's incomplete. I feel it would be important for him to state his entire analysis of Lalight's posts. He also doesn't seem to have the motivation to question his other possible suspects. Motivation as scum: Try to seem logical, randomly leave thread because he can't find a good reason to stay on person he is voting leaving his scumhunting incomplete without a conclusion, not truly care about sorting players such as Lalight (who asked him a good question) and Frozen Flame (of which I see no questions)."}

This seems a bit less fueled by being rational but rather by emotion. It was quite jumpy, and then he backs up realizing it wasn't a good push. Agent Sparkles is asked a good question by Lalight, and takes a long while to answer. This is another example of his lack of follow up. He is content with dropping his vote on Lalight without any extra analysis. I also don't really see much questioning towards Frozen Flame who he says he would be looking into.<br><br>He lacks the motivation to follow up with his suspicions, and he seems to randomly just get quiet after a bit. It's incomplete. I feel it would be important for him to state his entire analysis of Lalight's posts. He also doesn't seem to have the motivation to question his other possible suspects. Motivation as scum: Try to seem logical, randomly leave thread because he can't find a good reason to stay on person he is voting leaving his scumhunting incomplete without a conclusion, not truly care about sorting players such as Lalight (who asked him a good question) and Frozen Flame (of which I see no questions).</div></blockquote><br><br>What do you mean when you say 77 \"doesn't go anywhere\"?<br><br>Mulch wasn't null.

He tries to seem logical, but then makes a gutsy jump on Gamma and backtracks without truly thinking about it first. His play seems calculated, for example the mulch questioning doesn't lead to a conclusion, his vote on Lalight isn't really substantiated nor does he really go that deep into analyzing him as he has asked. Only until pressure builds does he come back to answer. (I waited a bit too but can't wait that long, have martial arts soon)<br><br>Null-town for Transcend. The dude does have a gut style of play, and I have seen him get lynched for that (and partially Gamma's fault too) in Thing Mafia. I say null-town since I have had him as null for the longest time but like his vote placements. I've had problems with him back when he used to be SodaSpirit, and really I can't say that I'll be able to have a strong read of him without a flip. I will have the same amount of difficulty reading him as I do with Marshy. The only thing that helps me with Marshy is I have been his scum buddy before, and have seen him be opportunistic af in another game. His play in Serenes Forest too. So I have some understanding of how Marshy plays as both alignments. Thing is I have only played one game (Thing Mafia) with Trascend before this. It's why I was asking Gamma to verify things for me, as I know they have a little bit more history together. (Even though Gamma may not feel confident in reading him, I'd still want some idea of how he plays)<br><br>So it was Null &gt; Null-town. I generally agreed with you that his initial start was garbage and was fine with wagoning him at that point. The only concern I have is his telling me that my Lalight vote won't go anywhere without really reading that thoroughly enough. I can definitely understand his null on me since in Thing Mafia he was town reading me hard, I was definitely trying to appeal to him there. I think in general, I am having the hardest time since I am familiar with a majority of the playerlist."}

At the moment, the number of slots I'm content with losing is too high to be of any use.<br><br>Not ordered in any way outside of the brackets.<br><br>~~<br><br>Ryker - Obv town.<br><br>Mulch -  Newbie for certain, but remains on my town list because I've yet to see the opportunism present in new scum. I have no qualms with the slot at the moment and if I'm wrong, it will become painfully apparent as the game goes on.<br><br>Ran - Town. I like Ran. He pokes and prods and I can very easily see the thought process behind his votes (ex. Mulch vote gets the game going. Firescreamer and Lalight votes to prod inactives. Agent Sparkles currently attempting to read).<br><br>Adum - His read list makes a lot of sense to me and mirrors a fair amount of my sentiment. The greatest point of contention I have with it is the Transcend slot which I am waffling on constantly, more on that later. In addition, his readlist is quite obviously in line with his behavior in thread and is demonstrably the result of his line of inquiry.<br><br>Marshy - I like Marshy as much as I can like Marshy. All I have are his votes, but I like his votes within the context of when they were placed.<br><br>~~<br><br>There ends the slots I would be sad to lose.<br><br>~~<br><br>Lalight - God I hate his recent post. I hate his read on me. I hate his read on FF. I hate his read on Mulch. I hate his meta comment on town votes and his read on Adum looks worse now, but that's unfair because the curtain was only recently pulled back. In addition, I like his read on Firescreamer. The ones that have been talked about less are: his read on Transcend, which is passable. His read on Sparkles is based on one (albeit a good one) post and ignores everything else, calling Sparkles \"consistent\" while only linking one post. I don't know what consistent means. Zulfy read final point seems like a fabricated reason to keep Zulfy at arm's length and I dislike it. Gamma Emerald he has no read on, which is somewhat understandable as well because he hasn't done anything major despite his high post count. Tammy and Marshy reads are both fine.<br><br>In the end, I REALLY don't like dealing with this slot, but get used to it because there's a lot of that.<br><br>Gamma Emerald - This guy has been all over the thread and has done nothing that jumps out to me at all. Would love not to have to read this slot, but I think it will require going through 30 pages just to see if I can find anything of value. I have absolutely nothing on this slot and that's a point against it at this stage. I would like him to give me some crispy reads so I can update my profile of him.<br><br>Transcend - I waffle on this slot, CONSTANTLY. Intro was disgusting, you saw me post about it. A lot of people jumped onto the slot for garbage reasons though. There were reasons to be on it, but I wasn't seeing it from most of the posters. The only one I can recall appreciating was Adum's most recent comments on him. I put this slot from scum, to town when I reconsidered that his self-meta garbage might just be distasteful to me and causing me to misread him, to scummier because I haven't seen him doing any meaningful scumhunting. I don't like reading this slot. He reminds me of how much I hate reading J.<br><br>Tammy - Complete crapshoot.<br><br>FF - Intro was good. I legitimately liked it. He was town on my list at that point. I haven't seen much of anything solid since then and that's concerning.<br><br>Sparkles - Doesn't. Do. Anything. He had one good post (#443), but I can mirror Ran after skimming back through that he never seems to go anywhere. I want a readslist from Sparkles.<br><br>Firescreamer - Grody slot. Can die. I cannot actively recall him actively pushing forward. Will click the ISO button and revisit.<br><br>Zulfy - BADLY need him to update his reads. All I can recall standing out is his read on Mulch, which is poorly formed.<br><br>~~<br><br>If I had to limit myself, it would be Firescreamer, Zulfy, Lalight, and Transcend. All of those slots can die for me at this point.<br><br>@everyone<br><br>Can I get your bottom four and how many of them you're willing to lynch at this point."}

He asked me a shitty false dilemma style question so I gave him a deliberately non-responsive answer. He was trying to force me between \"be blowing hot air\" and \"commit to saying you scum read me\" as if that is the only reason someone would vote for someone, especially within the first 24 hours of the game. I felt like he was trying to corner me with those forced choices so I was non-responsive and didn't give him the answer he wanted. I just reasserted I'd vote for him, but said I was busy doing something else at the moment. I was just being snarky, not trying to say I had some crazy hard read that that point. Like I said, I wasn't exactly being deliberate in my engagements that early in the game.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Well in addition to what I already asked I'd like current thoughts on Gemma and transcend. Probably gonna be asking a few other things after that.</div></blockquote><br><br>Gamma I've been ribbing because ever since his start with RQS, getting rattled by marshy's declaration of RQS being over (a la post 18), and generally just coming off as needing control and conformity to his standards of play, I've decided being antagonistic to this slot would be the best way to help me read it. Try to throw him off, bait unfiltered reactions and the like. Hasn't been as successful as I'd hoped as Gamma didn't bite as hard as I wanted, but still gave me some insight into the slot. Slot also has lots of early commentary on what exactly it is that mafiats like to do/not do which is always a narrative that scum love to control. But idk this guy likes to be passively authoritative so maybe he'd still be chomping at the bit to have that discussion as town.<br><br>Transcend I like pretty much only for consistency in votes, and choice of votes (except for when he voted me  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_mad.gif\" alt=\":mad:\" title=\"Mad\"> ). AS, Zulfy and Gamma are all fine plays IMO so I'll give him some cred. Also was expecting him to try to take more advantage of my early game laziness after he went and took my initial \"big\" post so seriously. When he dropped it after my response it made him seem slightly less opportunistic but he also seems good enough to realize pushing that too hard would've looked really bad and didn't want to catch full heat for pushing a lynch on such a shaky basis. Not quite a townread but not a top end play today IMO.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9218902#p9218902\" class=\"postlink\">post 806</a>, AdumbroDeus wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9218773#p9218773\" class=\"postlink\">post 786</a>, Transcend wrote:</cite>Yeh but i wasn't using my lynchbait-y ness to dissolve a bw on me.

This feels a little forced though I could see townbrodeus getting hung up on something like that if he was really subjectively sure of his read being correct.

On ToS forums I got torn apart and called an idiot once for calling someone trying to be too townie. \"Your supposed to be too townie, retard\" was basically their response.  Oh well, I'm not changing my mind about it.  But I'm glad you can acknoledge this and respond.<br><br>The thing about Sparkles is that I still remember early in the game when he did something I disliked, it was buddying or white knighting or something like that.  Even though multiple people have said that's a bad push, It's still in the back off my mind."}

This seems a bit less fueled by being rational but rather by emotion. It was quite jumpy, and then he backs up realizing it wasn't a good push. Agent Sparkles is asked a good question by Lalight, and takes a long while to answer. This is another example of his lack of follow up.

It's incomplete. I feel it would be important for him to state his entire analysis of Lalight's posts. He also doesn't seem to have the motivation to question his other possible suspects. Motivation as scum: Try to seem logical, randomly leave thread because he can't find a good reason to stay on person he is voting leaving his scumhunting incomplete without a conclusion, not truly care about sorting players such as Lalight (who asked him a good question) and Frozen Flame (of which I see no questions).</div></blockquote><br>This is interesting and I'll read him again to see if I agree<br>As for FS can you link/quote posts that relate to the push on him?"}

Transcend is the least. Well, I feel like I can't easily explain this. Let's call it \"Calm, Logical and Trustworthy\" and forget about this stupid word.

This seems a bit less fueled by being rational but rather by emotion. It was quite jumpy, and then he backs up realizing it wasn't a good push. Agent Sparkles is asked a good question by Lalight, and takes a long while to answer. This is another example of his lack of follow up. He is content with dropping his vote on Lalight without any extra analysis. I also don't really see much questioning towards Frozen Flame who he says he would be looking into.<br><br>He lacks the motivation to follow up with his suspicions, and he seems to randomly just get quiet after a bit. It's incomplete. I feel it would be important for him to state his entire analysis of Lalight's posts. He also doesn't seem to have the motivation to question his other possible suspects. Motivation as scum: Try to seem logical, randomly leave thread because he can't find a good reason to stay on person he is voting leaving his scumhunting incomplete without a conclusion, not truly care about sorting players such as Lalight (who asked him a good question) and Frozen Flame (of which I see no questions).</div></blockquote><br>I kinda get where you are with this read, I'll reread him since nothing in my own read goes against what you are saying here"}

Not a huge fan of how he's been so set on Mulch and yet refused to back up his reasoning with an example when Mulch asked him to. Sticking to throwing shade without supporting it (\"No, feel free to discredit that point as much as you want\") is not good.<br><br>Also, another one of his points on Mulch looks pretty bad in retrospect. When Mulch says that overdefensiveness is NAI and ends up acting defensive, Zulfy arbitrarily creates a connection here without considering that it would still be consistent for him as town trying to play to his wincon by not getting lynched. It especially pings me because Mulch's stance on this seems pretty obviously like a belief that he holds regardless of alignment (which should make it NAI if nothing else), so him trying to paint it as scummy looks forced.<br><br>Tammy- Null. Nothing AI yet.<br><br>Mulch- I struggled with this slot for a while and I\u2019m going to put him as a tentative townlean. Still feel like there are some NAI things he looked like he was pushing for the sake of pushing (the Ryker/Transcend cases), but the illogical response to people townreading him actually seems more good than bad on reread, because it\u2019s difficult to imagine scum!Mulch being that paranoid and instantly distrusting anyone who townreads him when he\u2019s already in somewhat of a negative spotlight. He could have easily coasted on the trust he was gaining and he essentially ran in the opposite direction. I also like how he\u2019s openly pressured people to give opinions on him, shows a desire for transparency.<br><br>FrozenFlame- Townlean, if only because of <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9219971#p9219971\">865</a>. Here he shows a unique and considerably hard to fake way of reaction baiting by claiming to have been purposely antagonistic to try to throw Gamma off. The effectiveness of this is debatable, but it makes perfect sense in regards to his earlier \u201cscumread\u201d and shows a level of inventive scumhunting that looks genuine. Most of his other posts are null at worst when I consider that he started out trying to help apply pressure before committing to anything.<br><br>@Frozen, the thing I\u2019d wanted an answer for was this, although it\u2019s not really relevant anymore for reasons I just explained:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9213277#p9213277\" class=\"postlink\">post 443</a>, Agent Sparkles wrote:</cite>I'm not sure I'm getting @FrozenFlame's page 9 scumread of Gamma. Gamma comments that he hasn't seen anyone include themselves in a readslist in a long time, so FF assumes he's being pretentious without much cause and thinks it's scummy?</div></blockquote><br><br>For those I can\u2019t go into detail for yet: Ranmaru and (to a lesser extent) Ryker are probably town. LaLight is currently my top suspect. Nullscum on marshy. Other slots are either null or still being worked out."}

Agent Sparkles is asked a good question by Lalight, and takes a long while to answer. This is another example of his lack of follow up.

It's incomplete. I feel it would be important for him to state his entire analysis of Lalight's posts. He also doesn't seem to have the motivation to question his other possible suspects. Motivation as scum: Try to seem logical, randomly leave thread because he can't find a good reason to stay on person he is voting leaving his scumhunting incomplete without a conclusion, not truly care about sorting players such as Lalight (who asked him a good question) and Frozen Flame (of which I see no questions).</div></blockquote>"}

Starting with his original stance on Agent Sparkles, showing that he cared more to rush a stance while not properly read up.

I also dislike that he is putting extra emphasis on trusting me, it feels like he is trying to link himself to me since that is all he can do as his position crumbles, especially as he describes himself as a player who finds it hard to trust anyone but himself, which is a natural stance to take as a newbie.

However, after getting further and seeing that you obviously have played with people here and they're vouching for you having a style, you can't have been trying to act like you didn't know how mafia works.  They still seem like silly questions to me, but right now I have a theory you play on a site that mafia kills are handled differently than every other site I've played on, so the questions themselves might not have anything to do with anything."}

If you're such an oversensitive/defensive person, your standard for \"ordinary\" sensitivity/defensiveness is likely to be skewed toward higher degrees of sensitivity/defensiveness relative to a person who does not have oversensitivity/defensiveness as character traits. If we accept shitty ad hom logic, we can just as easily disqualify your ability to assess oversensitivity/defensiveness by virtue of your own bias due to being more likely to express those traits. Your propensity to express them makes you a poor judge for objectively identifying when they are presenting in the average individual, because what is \"mild\" or \"ordinary\" to you is likely extreme to the average individual.<br><br>Not that I actually care to assess your capacity for objectively assessing one's oversensitivity/defensiveness.

My only ping from him was a false alarm in retrospect and nothing else is really standing out, but I\u2019d probably put him at nulltown for his earlier pressure on marshy and fairly natural-looking progression. His reads are generally vague and hard to make conclusions from, which is probably NAI.<br><br>Marshy- Probably the scummiest in the game (besides maybe LaLight) on reconsideration. Up until about page 20, he basically coasted on naked bandwagon votes without pressuring/scumhunting or giving any opinions. After that, he apparently still finds me and Zulfy suspicious but won't go into either of those, even after being repeatedly pressured to explain his Zulfy vote.<br><br>Then look at posts <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9222285#p9222285\">959</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9222315#p9222315\">961</a>, and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9222505#p9222505\">988</a>. The individual posts are alarming, the progression is worse. He theorizes that at least 2 and maybe 3 scum are off of the leading wagons, then immediately shows a level of confidence of at least one of us being scum that he\u2019s willing to lynch without a claim if one of us flips town (which is really awful and anti-town in itself) and call Gamma\u2019s opinion on both of us being town \u201cutterly insane\u201d and suggest he could be scum for it. And Marshy\u2019s \u201cmost of these votes are awful\u201d comment in 959 looks even worse when considering that his own votes on both slots had nothing visible behind them at all. And wanting to cut the day really short with the leading wagon on an inactive player (like he suggested) is deliberately hurtful to town even if they're right.<br><br>Ranmaru: My strongest townlean right now. His ISO is bleeding with the desire to sort people and  advance the game. Pressuring multiple people to contribute and be transparent, trying to dig deep into people\u2019s thought processes and understand them, and showing some evidence of deliberately doing extra research to read people. I wouldn't bet the game on it, but I feel pretty safe townreading him.<br><br>LaLight: Scum. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9217270#p9217270\">652</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9217304#p9217304\">660</a> both look fake. He supposedly scumreads Mulch and Ryker for a lot of empty posting early on, which is highly inaccurate and really looks like it\u2019s just for show. Ryker and Mulch (especially the latter) were both important contributors, as anyone who\u2019s been reading their posts should know, and he calls them out on it but not posters like Transcend or Marshy? Then he takes <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9213444#p9213444\">476</a> (which is completely NAI, by the way) and tries to make it about Ryker distracting attention from other players even though that has absolutely nothing to do with the post and everything else Ryker had done was about other slots. He\u2019s coming up with reasons to suspect people that don\u2019t exist. I acknowledge the explanation in the bottom paragraph, but he was using things that weren\u2019t even valid in the first place, not just exaggerating them.<br><br>660 is scummy for reasons already explained. I\u2019d expect town to address the reasoning behind the wagon (which he does, to an extent), but not to discredit and throw AtE attacks at the wagon solely on the basis of it being an easy wagon even if there are good reasons behind it (which he even admits himself that there are). Meaningless shade, not genuine thought.<br><br>Later, his vote on me is partially because he \u201creally trusts Ranmaru?\u201d Awfully convenient sheep vote for someone who never has townreads. Agree with Ryker that his argument of \u201clogic and consistency\u201d is shallow and could easily be applied to multiple people in this thread.<br><br>Anyway, I have more to say but I\u2019m leaving to stay at a hotel for the night. I know I\u2019m torturing some of you but I will definitely be fully caught up and updated on everything this weekend. I don't really want to replace out over temporary time issues.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Marshy</span><br><br>This slot and LaLight are the only sufficiently scummy players for me to lynch today."}

After that, he apparently still finds me and Zulfy suspicious but won't go into either of those, even after being repeatedly pressured to explain his Zulfy vote.<br><br>Then look at posts <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9222285#p9222285\">959</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9222315#p9222315\">961</a>, and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9222505#p9222505\">988</a>. The individual posts are alarming, the progression is worse. He theorizes that at least 2 and maybe 3 scum are off of the leading wagons, then immediately shows a level of confidence of at least one of us being scum that he\u2019s willing to lynch without a claim if one of us flips town (which is really awful and anti-town in itself) and call Gamma\u2019s opinion on both of us being town \u201cutterly insane\u201d and suggest he could be scum for it. And Marshy\u2019s \u201cmost of these votes are awful\u201d comment in 959 looks even worse when considering that his own votes on both slots had nothing visible behind them at all. And wanting to cut the day really short with the leading wagon on an inactive player (like he suggested) is deliberately hurtful to town even if they're right.<br><br>Ranmaru: My strongest townlean right now. His ISO is bleeding with the desire to sort people and  advance the game. Pressuring multiple people to contribute and be transparent, trying to dig deep into people\u2019s thought processes and understand them, and showing some evidence of deliberately doing extra research to read people. I wouldn't bet the game on it, but I feel pretty safe townreading him.<br><br>LaLight: Scum. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9217270#p9217270\">652</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9217304#p9217304\">660</a> both look fake. He supposedly scumreads Mulch and Ryker for a lot of empty posting early on, which is highly inaccurate and really looks like it\u2019s just for show. Ryker and Mulch (especially the latter) were both important contributors, as anyone who\u2019s been reading their posts should know, and he calls them out on it but not posters like Transcend or Marshy? Then he takes <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9213444#p9213444\">476</a> (which is completely NAI, by the way) and tries to make it about Ryker distracting attention from other players even though that has absolutely nothing to do with the post and everything else Ryker had done was about other slots. He\u2019s coming up with reasons to suspect people that don\u2019t exist. I acknowledge the explanation in the bottom paragraph, but he was using things that weren\u2019t even valid in the first place, not just exaggerating them.<br><br>660 is scummy for reasons already explained. I\u2019d expect town to address the reasoning behind the wagon (which he does, to an extent), but not to discredit and throw AtE attacks at the wagon solely on the basis of it being an easy wagon even if there are good reasons behind it (which he even admits himself that there are). Meaningless shade, not genuine thought.<br><br>Later, his vote on me is partially because he \u201creally trusts Ranmaru?\u201d Awfully convenient sheep vote for someone who never has townreads. Agree with Ryker that his argument of \u201clogic and consistency\u201d is shallow and could easily be applied to multiple people in this thread.<br><br>Anyway, I have more to say but I\u2019m leaving to stay at a hotel for the night. I know I\u2019m torturing some of you but I will definitely be fully caught up and updated on everything this weekend. I don't really want to replace out over temporary time issues.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Marshy</span><br><br>This slot and LaLight are the only sufficiently scummy players for me to lynch today.</div></blockquote><br><br>So well this is logical lol.  I think that the point on Marshy, and the progression, is really valid because I think scum have a huge tendency to do pre flip analysis, and saying \"at least one scum...\" etc on something is setting it up to shade the others if there ARENT or clear others if they are<br><br>2) I probably wouldent have noticed this if it were involving me, but did you just say my contributions were good but were earlier scumreading me?"}

My only ping from him was a false alarm in retrospect and nothing else is really standing out, but I\u2019d probably put him at nulltown for his earlier pressure on marshy and fairly natural-looking progression. His reads are generally vague and hard to make conclusions from, which is probably NAI.<br><br>Marshy- Probably the scummiest in the game (besides maybe LaLight) on reconsideration. Up until about page 20, he basically coasted on naked bandwagon votes without pressuring/scumhunting or giving any opinions. After that, he apparently still finds me and Zulfy suspicious but won't go into either of those, even after being repeatedly pressured to explain his Zulfy vote.<br><br>Then look at posts <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9222285#p9222285\">959</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9222315#p9222315\">961</a>, and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9222505#p9222505\">988</a>. The individual posts are alarming, the progression is worse. He theorizes that at least 2 and maybe 3 scum are off of the leading wagons, then immediately shows a level of confidence of at least one of us being scum that he\u2019s willing to lynch without a claim if one of us flips town (which is really awful and anti-town in itself) and call Gamma\u2019s opinion on both of us being town \u201cutterly insane\u201d and suggest he could be scum for it. And Marshy\u2019s \u201cmost of these votes are awful\u201d comment in 959 looks even worse when considering that his own votes on both slots had nothing visible behind them at all. And wanting to cut the day really short with the leading wagon on an inactive player (like he suggested) is deliberately hurtful to town even if they're right.<br><br>Ranmaru: My strongest townlean right now. His ISO is bleeding with the desire to sort people and  advance the game. Pressuring multiple people to contribute and be transparent, trying to dig deep into people\u2019s thought processes and understand them, and showing some evidence of deliberately doing extra research to read people. I wouldn't bet the game on it, but I feel pretty safe townreading him.<br><br>LaLight: Scum. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9217270#p9217270\">652</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9217304#p9217304\">660</a> both look fake. He supposedly scumreads Mulch and Ryker for a lot of empty posting early on, which is highly inaccurate and really looks like it\u2019s just for show. Ryker and Mulch (especially the latter) were both important contributors, as anyone who\u2019s been reading their posts should know, and he calls them out on it but not posters like Transcend or Marshy? Then he takes <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9213444#p9213444\">476</a> (which is completely NAI, by the way) and tries to make it about Ryker distracting attention from other players even though that has absolutely nothing to do with the post and everything else Ryker had done was about other slots. He\u2019s coming up with reasons to suspect people that don\u2019t exist. I acknowledge the explanation in the bottom paragraph, but he was using things that weren\u2019t even valid in the first place, not just exaggerating them.<br><br>660 is scummy for reasons already explained. I\u2019d expect town to address the reasoning behind the wagon (which he does, to an extent), but not to discredit and throw AtE attacks at the wagon solely on the basis of it being an easy wagon even if there are good reasons behind it (which he even admits himself that there are). Meaningless shade, not genuine thought.<br><br>Later, his vote on me is partially because he \u201creally trusts Ranmaru?\u201d Awfully convenient sheep vote for someone who never has townreads. Agree with Ryker that his argument of \u201clogic and consistency\u201d is shallow and could easily be applied to multiple people in this thread.<br><br>Anyway, I have more to say but I\u2019m leaving to stay at a hotel for the night. I know I\u2019m torturing some of you but I will definitely be fully caught up and updated on everything this weekend. I don't really want to replace out over temporary time issues.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Marshy</span><br><br>This slot and LaLight are the only sufficiently scummy players for me to lynch today.</div></blockquote><br>Me: I don't think he's trying hard enough, I have plenty of content to sort.<br>Marshy: I like his read, I never really considered the point about marshy denouncing the possibility of both wagon being on town<br>Ranmaru: I like his read, I feel he got to the same place I'm at just without meta.

That hammer on Zulfy was straight-up awful. For the vast majority of the day you want to lynch me, but when Ryker puts him at L-1 you immediately hammer him without letting him claim? I was still a very plausible lynch target yesterday, and for someone who thinks I've \"scumclaimed in every post\" the way you hopped off was disgusting.<br><br>Marshy, yesterday you said you should speedlynch me without a claim today if Zulfy flipped town, but you just went and started a FireScreamer wagon at dawn without even mentioning me once. Yet another disconnect.<br><br>So this is what I was getting ready to post when I saw it was night:<br><br><div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: </b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display: none;\">@Gamma- I have analyzed your content and I acknowledge that there\u2019s a lot of it, but it was consistently underwhelming in the sense that there was nothing I really felt like I should be promoting or attacking you for, especially with how vague most of your cases have been. Your accusation/assumption of me \u201cnot really analyzing you\u201d is gross, especially when you\u2019ve had me as a nullread for so long.<br><br>And about LaLight, I don\u2019t scumread him just because he AtE\u2019d or threw shade like you\u2019ve implied. Both of those things can be NAI depending on circumstances, especially if the person has a meta of it. My problem with it was how AtE and empty shade were the basis of his attack against his wagon. He tried hard to discredit self-admittedly reasonable votes on him simply by labeling himself as an easy target and trying to make them feel bad about it without any decent points about why the wagon was actually bad. Unless you were saying that he has a history of doing this exact thing as town, which I highly doubt you were.<br><br>Ranmaru, I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re asking me to explain myself regarding the case on me in general? I\u2019ll just go through the points against me in that case:<br><br>The activity/follow-up: You said yourself that activity is NAI for me. I\u2019ve replaced out as town before because catching up with the game combined with everything else I had to deal with was overwhelming and having not been present at the beginning made it hard to read people. The lack of follow-up is a byproduct of this, as most of my posts excluding the stretch at the beginning have been selecting things to address in the time that I had. I do care about solving the game, but right now is kind of a difficult time to do it, mostly because it\u2019s the last few weeks of my sophomore year. Lynch me if this hasn\u2019t changed by Day 2, since IRL should be a lot more convenient.<br><br>The jump on Gamma: First of all, attacking me for \u201cThis feels right\u201d or saying I\u2019m contradicting my anti-gut meta is ridiculous, because I explained my logic for it in the post afterward. I realize now that it wasn\u2019t a good reason to suspect him, but at the time I saw his posts and went \u201cwhy is he making conclusions off of things that he isn\u2019t even really looking at?\u201d There was maybe one +1 point that Zulfy didn\u2019t go into, which made Gamma\u2019s assessment look really fake until I changed my view from \u201cdoes this make sense as town\u201d to \u201cis there actual scum motivation behind this?\u201d And I don\u2019t get Ranmaru\u2019s point about suspecting Gamma out of emotion instead of reason. There wasn\u2019t a single post in that push that came from a \u201chey, I dislike this so let\u2019s push it\u201d mindset.<br><br>My posts appearing designed for towncred: I don\u2019t really know how to disprove this, I\u2019m just telling things the way I see them. A little more elaboration on this would help (since it seems to extend beyond the follow-up argument).<br><br>The RQS thing: Yeah, I don\u2019t know why this is even a point at all. Gamma brought it up and I saw no reason why it should hinder us, so I went along with it and questioned those who slammed the idea right off the bat.<br><br>It looks like LaLight and Zulfy are more likely lynch candidates right now, but I\u2019d still lynch Marshy if people are up for it. His recent posts have not impressed me and he really needs to justify the points that I\u2019ve brought up against him, especially the extremely fake progression.<br><br>In the meantime, @Mulch, what do you think of my points against LaLight? The supposedly towny posts you pointed out were the same ones that pinged me, and I don\u2019t think (s)he brought up any good points against Ryker at all. At best they can pretty much be knocked down by looking at Ryker\u2019s ISO.<br><br>I\u2019m not interested in voting {Ranmaru, Ryker, FrozenFlame, Mulch} today. I would vastly prefer to lynch one of Light and Marshy, maybe compromise on Zulfy or Deus. Anyone else would need a good case.</div></div></div>"}

And no, my vote on you isn't at all based on associations, thats why I'm asking transcend to elaborate on his lynchpool because if he's picking up on associations Im missing I want to hear about them. My vote on you is entirely based on the fact that I find it extremely sketchy that your wagon stalled so hard when frankly I don't think anyone was really articulating any strong reasoning as to why you ought be townread/not wagonned, which makes me feel like town players were just feeling apathetic about the wagon and scum used that apathy as an excuse to not bus and wait for something else to catch on. That and the fact that I think Ran made some good points re: you not really caring to follow up and drill down on the people you were pressing D1. But yeah its mostly the fact that your wagon hit a brick wall absent any concrete opposition to your lynch, while Zulfy's wagon super turbo'd with almost no effort whatsoever. I didn't see your slot as being particularly distinguishable from Zulfy as far as being a play is concerned, so yeah, that very clear difference in how your wagons were handled I find unsettling.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9244648#p9244648\" class=\"postlink\">post 1630</a>, marshy wrote:</cite>what the fuck?<br><br>smh. no more of this paranoia to shade blatant non plays. no more. this is what sunk us in xkcd. no idea why youd reactively say this when theres more than enough to read ran and ryker<br><br>frozen. you need to step it UP today dude. like hardbody boi</div></blockquote><br><br>I think you're reading into what I'm saying a little too much. I'm not at all suggesting that merely by virtue of the adum NK that suddenly you/Ran/ryker are plays. Not even close. I was just spitballing here and saying what potential motives immediately came to mind upon seeing the flip. Again, adum is a weird as fuck NK target and I was articulating some simple explanations that came to mind. Not really sure why me mentioning that you/Ran/ryker might have motive to kill adum based on meta is so offensively bad to you. I wasn't at all saying we should be looking at you three as top plays. Far from it.<br><br>I guess if you felt that I was trying to be sneaky here and subtly throw shade at you just based on this NK motive argument I can get why you're having such a severe reaction but damn man I'm a bit surprised you reacted this way"}

I\u2019ve replaced out as town before because catching up with the game combined with everything else I had to deal with was overwhelming and having not been present at the beginning made it hard to read people. The lack of follow-up is a byproduct of this, as most of my posts excluding the stretch at the beginning have been selecting things to address in the time that I had. I do care about solving the game, but right now is kind of a difficult time to do it, mostly because it\u2019s the last few weeks of my sophomore year. Lynch me if this hasn\u2019t changed by Day 2, since IRL should be a lot more convenient.<br><br>The jump on Gamma: First of all, attacking me for \u201cThis feels right\u201d or saying I\u2019m contradicting my anti-gut meta is ridiculous, because I explained my logic for it in the post afterward. I realize now that it wasn\u2019t a good reason to suspect him, but at the time I saw his posts and went \u201cwhy is he making conclusions off of things that he isn\u2019t even really looking at?\u201d There was maybe one +1 point that Zulfy didn\u2019t go into, which made Gamma\u2019s assessment look really fake until I changed my view from \u201cdoes this make sense as town\u201d to \u201cis there actual scum motivation behind this?\u201d And I don\u2019t get Ranmaru\u2019s point about suspecting Gamma out of emotion instead of reason. There wasn\u2019t a single post in that push that came from a \u201chey, I dislike this so let\u2019s push it\u201d mindset.<br><br>My posts appearing designed for towncred: I don\u2019t really know how to disprove this, I\u2019m just telling things the way I see them. A little more elaboration on this would help (since it seems to extend beyond the follow-up argument).<br><br>The RQS thing: Yeah, I don\u2019t know why this is even a point at all.

I can see it.  He could have talked in the mafiachat and thought to try and have a plan to shake off a scumread by you.

ScumLight gains nothing from sticking his neck out like that just to town confirm marshy. There isn't even anything approaching serious momentum for a marshy wagon today, nor should there be. Why blow a big fakeclaim when under barely any pressure to clear a slot that frankly no one has strong opinions about? The whole having to wait until N3 for another investigation being motivation for claiming now makes perfect sense to me given LaLight's articulated fear that he may not live that long. Plenty of folks, myself included, have been tossing around LaLight as a preferred play so I think his claim comes from a place of town motivation i.e. he wants to reduce confusion and allow people to focus their attention more fruitfully, and of course provide the town with a nice clear on a hard to read slot.<br><br>I think the arguments re: whether a cop ought investigate null slots or top scum slots is debateable and kind of a wash. Investigate nulls and you get info on slots that will be the hardest to read later due to lack of associations with the people who flip early, at the risk of missing important early game clears/guilties to secure early game scum lynches/avoid early town mislynches. Investigate top scum reads early to avoid early mislynches and correct poor groupthinky scumreads, or confirm them for easy early game town advantage and of course the ever crucial scum flip, at the risk that you let those null reads remain null and become nasty question marks in the late game.<br><br>Either way, whether or not I think LaLight was strategically optimal in choosing marshy is kind of irrelevant. Point is it makes sense given his order of operations in sheeping marshy and then basically saying lol fuck it and just spilling the beans.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9247431#p9247431\" class=\"postlink\">post 1822</a>, Ranmaru wrote:</cite>Lalight, here is the thing. You played a suspicious and weird game. You haven't been as proactive as I would expect from a cop. Compare that to Mulch's play.</div></blockquote><br><br>Uhhhhh what? Why in the world would a cop want to be a huge obnoxious presence like mulch was early on? If you draw that much attention to yourself you're likely to be either heavily scum read or heavily town read by a decent chunk of the game. Lots of townreads gets a bullet which is horrible cop play. Lots of scumreads puts you on lynch lineup which might force you to claim early which is horrible cop play. Being questionable enough to not eat an NK but also townie enough to avoid lynch pressure is the sweetspot big PRs really ought to shoot for. Im not saying that LaLight hit that sweetspot, but how the fuck do you think mulch is emblematic of \"expected\" cop play? I couldn't disagree more here. Drawing attention to oneself like mulch did so early in the game is antithetical to the play a strong town PR should exhibit IMO.<br><br>Transcend has been on an upward trend IMO all game and him sticking his neck out to confirm a slot like LaLight only continues that. Ignoring the actual circumstances of how this claim played out, I think anyone would recognize that LaLight's slot wouldn't necessarily be believe at face value. For example, if we were wagonning LaLight right now and then he made this claim to save his ass, I doubt it would be received all that well. LaLight &amp; Transcend being scum together doing a joint claim and support gambit is outrageously risky and doesn't make any sense for them to try to pull at this point in the game. And frankly, if Transcend and Lalight are scum pulling this stunt, why would Transcend offer such a vague confirmation? \"I have reason to believe that he's actually an Odd night X\" really to me makes a pretty clear suggestion about what's in Transcend's role PM, but it's still not offering much. Whereas had transcend really wanted to, he could have claimed something more powerful along the lines of tracker/reporter to say \"Hey, LaLight actually did a thing last night, can confirm.\" I mean by claiming he has indicative info in his role PM, he's already claiming to be non VT, so why not go all the way if you're trying to pull a mega gambit?<br><br>Point is, I don't see scumTranscend and scumLaLight working together here. Willing to trust both of their claims. And I just really like Transcends lynch pool. Firescreamer can go for having obvious D1 interaction derivative motive to kill adum, Agent Sparkles for having a massively sketchy wagon stall followed by an almost effortless stampeding of Zulfy, and Gamma just because my gut hasn't like that slot all game and his play hasn't really done anything to assuage it. Down to start with FireScreamer though, as I agree with Transcend that he and FireScreamer were to two grossest votes on Zulfy. Speaking of which, I respect transcend's self awareness on that front but am also sympathetic to his impatience and wanting to end the day for some flips.

My gut tells me Gamma is serving FireScreamer up softballs re: defending his vanity voting, but goddamn that is some obvious buddying for scum buddies. I mean FS even asks Gamma to \"vouch\" for his playstyle at one point. That's ballsy as fuck buddying IMO. And of course there's this little gem:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9217823#p9217823\" class=\"postlink\">post 734</a>, FireScreamer wrote:</cite>Gamma's town.

Part of me is saying there's no way scum buddy this obviously when one is under pressure from one fucking slot and thats it, but another part of me wants to believe that FS really was irked by the pressure and leaned on a scummate who happened to be active in the thread to shake it.

Basically I think optimal cop play is you want to be present enough to 1.) Not get unnecessary heat for lurking  and 2.) not get read by the scum as hiding in the shadows and thus likely have a PR. You probably shouldn't be spearheading wagons early on because if you're nailing scum with your reads you're asking for a bullet, so I think it's best to play support on wagons you find to have merit but being the leading voice is generally a bad idea IMO. Makes you seem non threatening to scummies. But of course there's no universal best set of tactics for any PR, this is just my take on it in a vacuum. And obviously the longer you live in the game the less relevant all of this becomes. IMO the cops goal should be to live atleast 2 day phases and get a guilty which you claim pretty much asap unless you are in a position to spearhead a wagon on the guilty without having to claim, or get 2 town clears on players that are likely to survive to late in the game since if you targets get lynched/NK'd those investigations are wasted.

Jimbob's roleblocker claim was shit and though I distrusted it I should've come down harder on it... but yeah slightly different scenario there as well as the game guaranteed that every slot had a PR so in that scenario I knew everyone would have to commit to something.

A universal back up gets a role that can neighborize. If UB usually can only absorb one alignments roles, this may in a way clear Tammy? Get what I mean guys?</div></blockquote><br><br>So let's think about this. Tammy is claiming that she copies the \"first town power role to die.\" The automatic nature of the role is unconfirmable, because if she is anti-town with a \"duplicator\" role as described earlier, she could easily choose to just duplicate the first PR to die and then claim she was forced to do so.<br><br>So basically one of the following must be true. Either A.) Tammy is town (and therefore presumably has no reason to lie) and is legitimately an automatic backup for the first town PR to die or B.) She is a scum \"duplicator\" that allows her to take on the powers of any dead PR on a night of her choosing.<br><br>If B, is the case, then she's capitalizing on the neighborizer flip to pick up an easy to confirm role that frankly doesn't give the town much utility, but boosts her status because she'll get some town cred for her claim checking out. She would do this to avoid having to claim non-automatic town universal backup later in the game, and then have to go though the charade of justifying her later pick and all the rationale that went into the timing of the pick, weighing it against other dead PRs and their utility, etc. Cashing in early for a lukewarm, weak utility role like neighborizer cements her as having an easy safe claim that she can confirm for easy town cred, and allows her to avoid being directed by the town later and thus force her to either cooperate and help the town by extending the life of a stronger town PR, or risk her own life through non-coorperation.<br><br>So basically if she's scum, she would have had to identify taking the neighborizer as the low risk low reward play and jumped on this moment to claim in order to make the claim seem more legitimate considering she was under no pressure whatsoever to make her claim. In fact her claim seems impulsive, that impulsivity perhaps driven through legitimate excitement about getting her \"favorite\" role, or perhaps it was calculated \"fake impulsivity\" designed to capitalize on the maelstrom of activity taking place and give her claim a feeling of greater authenticity.<br><br>If she's town, then she just claimed what she did because that's what she actually is and didn't have a choice in the matter re: the power she took and was legitimately excited about what she got.<br><br>So to summarize, I think if we could actually prove that tammy is an AUTOMATIC backup that has to take the first PR to flip, you're probably right Ran that it would clear her because forcing a scum backup to take the first PR to flip, town or otherwise, could potentially create a lot of problems (problems which people seem to be suggesting would result in the role not making the cut for a normal game here on MS due to the thorough design vetting process). Problem is, we have no way to confirm whether her role is actually automatic or not, because if she had a choice she could very easily just pretend that her hand was forced and there would be no way to contradict her. So ultimately, the context and timing of her claim are more important to look at here when informing your read than the alleged automatic nature of her ability. So in a technical sense no, I don't think her claim clears her. But I think she is unlikely to make such a claim as scum given how much more potential there is for creating misinformation with a scum duplicator role later in the game with a better duplicated claim. But idk, I've never played with tammy before, and maybe the safe, low impact approach is how she plays scum? What do you think Ran?"}

Now that you've confirmed that you just created a private chat and your power doesn't confirm you as town to anyone, frankly your role is much less useful than I originally thought. Much rather force the scum to choose between odd night cop (and a potential doc coverage of said cop) and you possibly getting private chat with the game's top town read. Plus, now that Ran has already used his ability he's effectively VT, so its nbd if he takes a bullet other than the inconvenience of losing a strong universal town read. But I think most of us were already prepared for that loss last night so that isn't anything new."}

(and yesterday, now that you have AS's flip in mind)</div></blockquote><br><br>As I've said before, I highly doubt scumscend sticks his neck out like that to lend credence to LaLight's claim. Insanely gambitty for a game where, now that we know AS was town, town's two best wagons D1 were on townies so clearly, pre-claim, scum aren't looking like they're pinned and need some huge game changing claim to revolutionize reads/momentum. Also, as previously mentioned, I doubt he chooses the method he did for supporting LaLight if he's scum. He basically just confirmed he's non-VT and that he has reason to believe the Odd night modifier is in this game. This shows he doesn't want to show his full hand but still wants to clarify the picture we have by minimizing his exposure for relatively greater informational gains since the context he's providing re: whether or not Odd night modifier is likely legitimate outweighs the exposure he's subjecting his own slot to. If he were scum, I'd expect him to make a full claim complementing LaLight's claim to drill the gambit home. If one of them flips scum they're both going down anyway, even with his minimalist support of LaLight by reference to mechanics in his own role PM. If you're going to create that obviously link and risk the one two punch if one of you eventually flips, why not sell the whole thing and just make a full complementary fake claim? It doesn't make sense to me for LaLight/Transcend working together as scum to pull this off in such a half baked fashion.<br><br>So generally speaking Transcend's towniness has been on the upswing today from my perspective and he is distinctly a non play. I will note though that I was a bit surprised when he posted 1861 &amp; 1862, saying my firescream voting post was \"good\" and that I \"might not have any tricks up my sleeve.\" Came off as trying to butter me up and prevent me from going back and questioning my interpretation of LaLight's claim and his support of it. Sure maybe he's thought I've been genuinely scummy this game and actually got town pings from my post, but it just had this gross feeling of patting me on the head and calling me a good boy while he pulls the wool over my eyes. I think mulch is right to call him on the sketchiness of that.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9248836#p9248836\" class=\"postlink\">post 1974</a>, Mulch wrote:</cite>Transcend is basically claiming even night cop?

You are aggresive and not afraid to show scumreads, but you have townreads mixed in as well.  I don't like how you call my fight with Zulfy \"something to fall alseep\", I thought it was valid and that pings me a little.  Still scumreading me though which is a plus.  I'm confused about why you don't have me as your top scum with \"kill mulch with fire\" though, which is a gap in logic but not neccecarily AI.  I feel like you are manipulting me on how I was speaking to adumbrodeus.  Why do you keep scumreading me without a vote? It's getting negative at this point.  Again, and again, you obsess over me but don't vote me.  I am nullscum?  Yet you keep mentioning me?  Shading is scummy. Ez vote on lalight.  Buddying gamma.  WHY DO YOU KEEP SAYING YOU WILL VOTE ME but never do.  And you try to attack my white knighting -_- (NAI).  Again votes lalight? WTF is with this shade on me then?  Aaand quick switch on Zulfy.<br><br>I don't have the will or want to do individual posts.<br><br>Overall read:  Basically your entire game has been shading me as scum, without actually doing anything about it.  On the one hand, it's good that you are willing to scumread someone townread.  On the other hand...you keep doing it without voting.  Honestly, it's behavior that I would suspect if we were scumbuddies together.

The social aspect and solving the puzzle are two of my favorite things about mafia and a neighborhood combines those.  Sometimes you can get better reads from a neighborhood tak than in game talk especially considering it's usually harder for scum to keep up with a neighborhood and the thread.  You get a different read that way.  You can also talk during the night and gamesolve after flips which can be given to the thread by your neighbor in the event of your death.<br><br>It just adds a deeper level to the game that I very much enjoy."}

If you're looking for a full ISO I cant get to that until tomorrow as I blew all of my uninterrupted mafia time earlier today ISOing adum &amp; FS. I can do AS/Gamma tomorrow.<br><br>As for hating on my suggestion to neighborize ran, I understand that you don't want to run the risk of Ran eating the bullet and then giving tammy the opportunity to play the \"lol I keep failing and can never confirm my claim\" card but that was really just coming from the idea that Ran is the most trusted, and now borderline cleared slot in the game, so he'd be the best to report back. But yeah you're right, its not necessarily the top play as it puts too many eggs in one basket counting on scum to feel pressure to off LaLight as claimed cop. Between marshy and Ran that 50/50 is good enough IMO, but yeah the more I think about it, tammy faking this claim and then needing to rope a scum mate in to fake confirm the neighborization seems wayyyy too involved for such a low stakes claim, so really she can target whoever she pleases, no need for direction as confirmation should be a no brainer here. The key is landing on someone who survives like you said. Problem is, if we don't direct tammy, she can always do what you've articulated fear of; claim she targeted whoever ends up dying. Without forcing her to commit to a set, scumtammy will always have the option to claim she targeted the NK. But yeah ultimately you're right that it doesn't need to be ran and we probably shouldnt direct her to ONLY target ran to keep scum guessing."}

You are aggresive and not afraid to show scumreads, but you have townreads mixed in as well.  I don't like how you call my fight with Zulfy \"something to fall alseep\", I thought it was valid and that pings me a little.  Still scumreading me though which is a plus.  I'm confused about why you don't have me as your top scum with \"kill mulch with fire\" though, which is a gap in logic but not neccecarily AI.  I feel like you are manipulting me on how I was speaking to adumbrodeus.  Why do you keep scumreading me without a vote? It's getting negative at this point.  Again, and again, you obsess over me but don't vote me.  I am nullscum?  Yet you keep mentioning me?  Shading is scummy. Ez vote on lalight.  Buddying gamma.

No that's the one I was trying hard to defend that lynch but he died anyway. That's the one with Dabuz where you scumread him before I did but I'm not sure if it's just cuz you always scumread him though.  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_igmeou.gif\" alt=\":igmeou:\" title=\"IGMEOU\"> I'm talking about the game where Jdietz... Gheb... and... some other guy... were lynched in a row. J was lynched D1. Ok it's coming to me now... the game where I replaced in... for some scummy dude but I was town so peeps were like 'oh it's town ran'... ok it was inactive as fuck I kinda remember I just forgot the damn name... anyway at the end me and SanfroidWarrior are like 'nah we are town to each other' and I had doubts on her but eventually we are like Gheb is prob scum and he couldn't do shit about it."}

I sometimes find that I've been defending scum all game in other games, which makes me lean to being a bit more flexible and open with my reads. I also noted that Red Ryu had some good reads in Flavorless Mafia II since he wasn't as involved as others, but he could see the big picture. Also like I mentioned to Marshy, those scum were not hype to me at all. It feels a lot better to lynch scum when you <span style=\"font-style: italic\">feel</span> it is right.

Very heavily leaning GE considering he's been in my lynchpool pretty much all game and my analysis re: Transcend sticking his neck out for LaLight yesterday still stands. Don't see scum transcend doing that when we were basically on course to mislynch FS anyway.<br><br>Tammy targetting marshy is questionable at best. Sure, marshy was pseudo cleared since we're believing Lalight's claim but that just makes him an obvious target. Frankly, marshy was more likely to be targeted than Lalight because Lalight isn't a threat again until tonight if he's odd night cop and marshy flipping town does nothing to confirm lalight while lalight flipping town cop 100% clears marshy barring godfather type shit. Scum are smart and knew a marshy townflip doesnt clear lalight because scum can easy fake that result, thought I'm not sure Lalight was under so much pressure that it warranted him quick fake claiming cop with an uncontroversial clear on a townie to get focus off of him. All in all marshy looks like a good target to neighborize because he's a trusted pseudo cleared slot that can reliably report back on Tammy's ability, but a little more thought reveals that he's actually likely to be a top contender for the NK over LaLight. Ran and marshy I think are the two hardest \"clears\" in the game right now and with scum likely anticipating MYLO, they want to get rid of as many clear or close clears as possible.<br><br>Either way, as said above, tammy isn't a play today given Transcend/GE claim contradiction.<br><br>Mulch's jumpiness is unsettling as fuck.<br><br>Ran if you legitimately think I could be scum with GE and Ryker you've gotta be out of your mind. I've had GE in my lynch pool basically all game and I literally switched on having ryker as town to having him as scum lean for pretty much no reason other than I though he wasn't doing anything to maintain my town read of him. That's a flimsy ass bus if that's what you actually think that is, especially when ryker wasn't even being considered as a play at that point.<br><br>Not sure what to think about GE's whole 1/6 vs 1/9 alleged scum slip. Need to think about that some more and let all of this digest a bit.<br><br>Transcend's crumbs are meh. Don't necessarily ping as faked but the commuter crumb to mislead especially could have been fake context building from a skilled player with enough foresight to recognize that sending mixed crumb signals to confuse the scum would ostensibly look good. Basically the crumbs aren't enough to convince me but they don't make me question my already town lean on Transcend just by his play.<br><br>But yeah overall going to need to do some re-reading before I come down on this but very much preferring GE lynch over transcend right now and that won't be disturbed lightly"}

Transcend has crumbs that are not convincing, and are past D1. It's possible his mates could have role copped myself or someone else to have an idea of what to crumb. Transcend didn't commit to Agent Sparkles, his main scumread of D1. He made an awkward switch to Zulfy. D2, he makes a VCA and tries to use the fact Agent Sparkles is scum and uses that to kill Firescream before having Agent Sparkles scum flip in hand. It turns out, both were town. He has a 'meh' stance on Gamma all game but when I bring up things that may turn his read to Gamma town he never considers it or speaks to me to reconsider it, he simply keeps him at meh. I note the non-engagement, and the apathetic play. Yet I don't find it to be suspicious. <br><br>Lalight, has scum intent in his play as I have already outlined in my <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9245548#p9245548\">1642</a>. Most importantly his entrance is telling. His tone changes between D1 and D2 are also telling. I noted that in D2, he had the same tone as he did in the scum game he has given me. Another major concern is he claimed cop very early without pressure, most likely to seem town rather to gain reactions + a wagon. I would lynch him today if the Transcend/Gamma situation wasn't here. Yet, I want him dead. Eventually, I don't care if he is cop. He must die. He admits to playing scummy as a method of playing PR's. I don't totally agree with that. I don't trust his slot, I want it dead in the water.<br><br>Mulch I have explained as the one to be my least confident scum read, yet he is still suspicious. I mention his very early post discrediting ryker when he didn't even scum read him, is suspicious because there was no town motivation to post that other than to <span style=\"font-style: italic\">shade</span> a player as he blames others of doing to him. I also find it majorly concerning that he had not done a full reads list but instead has been doing them 1 by 1 or 2 by 2. It would give him a chance to not give a stance on everyone, and he could come out with a stance out of no where on Transcend or Marshy. His reaction to the mass claim seemed like a soft, and then he claims VT which doesn't make sense. He can read, so there was no purpose to ask about mass claim. (He was like 'uh... right ok... I had a claim but ok...' is what it sounded like). I find his questioning telling, such as asking about who I'd trust between him and Transcend if Transcend gave him a guilty. I also agree with Ryker that his play this phase was bad, doesn't seem to be like a townie who is being cautious and wants to win the game. I also felt he wasn't really trying to sort Tammy but really just condemn her for missing her action."}

I would find it to be reasonable to have something to balance against the vig, which makes sense of being the universal back-up. I don't actually disbelieve tammy here, I just wish she didn't actually claim UB outright, but I do know she loves neighbor. Even so, if this is correct, then we can assume the UB + Vig may be legit. There's no protective in sight. I don't think there would be a cop and a gunsmith, which are two investigative alongside a neighbor. Ask yourselves if Tammy isn't UB, how would there be a role to balance my role? I don't think the gunsmith or cop would balance against them. Gunsmith seems like it would make sense alongside a vig because <span style=\"font-style: italic\">a vig has a gun</span> but yet Transcend's crumbs are vague and don't actually mention anything about gunsmith. Everyone else is VT, it seems. I think that's it. I think Transcend and Lalight are both fake claiming, yes I know that's crazy. Notice Lalight's entrance to D3, was still suspicious, even when he is outed. I would expect a town cop to actually act with more bravado and energy after being outed, but I see none of that here. There is no town motivation there."}

Transcend has crumbs that are not convincing, and are past D1. It's possible his mates could have role copped myself or someone else to have an idea of what to crumb. Transcend didn't commit to Agent Sparkles, his main scumread of D1. He made an awkward switch to Zulfy. D2, he makes a VCA and tries to use the fact Agent Sparkles is scum and uses that to kill Firescream before having Agent Sparkles scum flip in hand. It turns out, both were town. He has a 'meh' stance on Gamma all game but when I bring up things that may turn his read to Gamma town he never considers it or speaks to me to reconsider it, he simply keeps him at meh. I note the non-engagement, and the apathetic play. Yet I don't find it to be suspicious. <br><br>Lalight, has scum intent in his play as I have already outlined in my <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9245548#p9245548\">1642</a>. Most importantly his entrance is telling. His tone changes between D1 and D2 are also telling. I noted that in D2, he had the same tone as he did in the scum game he has given me. Another major concern is he claimed cop very early without pressure, most likely to seem town rather to gain reactions + a wagon. I would lynch him today if the Transcend/Gamma situation wasn't here. Yet, I want him dead. Eventually, I don't care if he is cop. He must die. He admits to playing scummy as a method of playing PR's. I don't totally agree with that. I don't trust his slot, I want it dead in the water.<br><br>Mulch I have explained as the one to be my least confident scum read, yet he is still suspicious. I mention his very early post discrediting ryker when he didn't even scum read him, is suspicious because there was no town motivation to post that other than to <span style=\"font-style: italic\">shade</span> a player as he blames others of doing to him. I also find it majorly concerning that he had not done a full reads list but instead has been doing them 1 by 1 or 2 by 2. It would give him a chance to not give a stance on everyone, and he could come out with a stance out of no where on Transcend or Marshy. His reaction to the mass claim seemed like a soft, and then he claims VT which doesn't make sense. He can read, so there was no purpose to ask about mass claim. (He was like 'uh... right ok... I had a claim but ok...' is what it sounded like). I find his questioning telling, such as asking about who I'd trust between him and Transcend if Transcend gave him a guilty. I also agree with Ryker that his play this phase was bad, doesn't seem to be like a townie who is being cautious and wants to win the game. I also felt he wasn't really trying to sort Tammy but really just condemn her for missing her action.</div></blockquote><br><br>1) You keep mentioning this, and I would call him out on it every time if I could: There is literally no point to asking a question you can ask a mod in private in the chat publicly except for town cred.<br><br>2)  I can give a full reads list if you requested it or even now, it's just meta.  In fact, I post big long walls as scum<br><br>3)  It's not my fault someone joked about a mass claim so I needed to know if we were actually doing it<br><br>4)  Again, I am aggresive because I am excited, this is literally my first MyLo as town<br><br>5)  Correct lol but nothing I can say about that, the odds of tammy being right here are so extraodrinarily low (I still think this), that I really dont have any qualms to aggresively pushing her, I didn't even know there was a guilty before i pushed her and once we got the guilty I reassessed"}

Have you read the scum game he linked way earlier?</div></blockquote><br><br>The bolded has been bothering the fuck out of me. If he's truly a VT and trascend comes out with a claim like that saying he's guilty of having a gun, why don't we see more from the slot? It's fucking MYLO and if I'm GE and I know someone is lying about me, I'd be frothing at the mouth pushing that lynch because I now know the guaranteed safe path to keeping town in the game. But we haven't gotten that at all. All we got was \"lol guiz transcend is lying\" and a crossvote with literally nothing helpful after that other than a few random one liners. Nothing substantive. It feels like GE just knows he's caught and doesn't want to potentially expose his scummates through more detailed interaction. He's just clamming up and hope transcend ropes himself thanks to growing paranoia re: the claims. If I were GE, and I KNEW that transcend was scum, which he should if GE is actually town, I'd be doing everything I could to build a case on transcend and bust this game wide open. But we've gotten the farthest thing from it, nothing but coasting and waiting.<br><br>Transcend is atleast trying on some level to get people on GE. Granted it hasn't been much more effort than transcend has put into any wagon he's endorsed this game but that typicality isn't undermining my faith in his claim nor my read on his gradually improving play this game.<br><br>Between these two the choice is clear to me. If GE is town, he's completely dropped the ball given the situation he's in, but I suspect he's just caught scum unsure of how this 50/50 will play out and wants to be conservative incase he gets lynch and we can then use his ISO to tease out the rest of the team. If transcend is scum, frankly he did a great job gambitting on supporting the Lalight claim and capitalizing on not really needing to do so and selling it for town cred. He really had no reason to do that unless both him and LaLight are scum which I just very strongly doubt at this point; they had no motive to help narrow the lynch pool yesterday the way they did by clearing marshy and removing LaLight from lynch contention through his claim. If Transcend is scum here I just been straight outplayed with help from townGE just rolling over and letting scum close the game out when he's the only person in the game who KNOWS who a mafiat is. There's just no way I see any good faith townie like GE is in this situation.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Gamma Emerald</span><br><br>Sorry if I'm throwing this town but the more and more I read through this day phase I only feel more strongly about this. I'm kind of feeling ryker's frustrated sentiments here re: this game being draining thanks to zulfy/FS/tammy all barely playing and us getting baited/pseudo forced into dealing with those slots else face an impossible endgame. I ISO'd every dead player in the game D2 to help me decide whether to stay or switch on FS and that only lead me to join a mislynch so at this point I'm convince that our reads collectively have just been shit this game and that focusing on this 50/50 is the best way to build an understanding of this game from the ground up. My gut has been telling me GE all game so at this point that plus GE's general apathy with the keys to the game in hand if he's town is more than enough for me to say he's the play."}

Both wagons are at 3, and we need 5. Only mulch and Ran haven't voted. If Ran votes wrong is game over because a scum will jump to hammer unless all three scrum are wagoning together right now.

Alright well you said you could clear yourself which is pretty strong language but I get what you meant now.<br><br>2.) Dude how the fuck could you possibly believe that's the scum team? Literally the two people I've picked fights with in this game are GE and Tammy. GE has pretty much always been in my lynch pool, and frankly I antagonized tammy for no good reason. Why would I deliberately antagonize them both when neither of them was in top contention as a play? That's the shittiest bussing I've ever seen if that's what you think was going on. Like I would have just been blatantly conjuring reasons to fight with my partners for no goddamn reason. And do you seriously believe I'm looking to bus GE here and ride any credit I get from that to endgame? I've been on and off people's lynchpools all game. Why would I have the confidence to think I could get away with forcing a bus here and then riding the cred for a later phase win? If tammy and GE were my partners I'd be full blow attacking transcend and going for the win right now. I'm honestly shocked you think a me, GE, tammy team would be trying to play the long game right now."}

This could explain why Titus is voting Transcend, and Ryker too.   HOWEVER.  Right now, if scum mess up (either Gamma is lynched as scum or Transcend is lynched as scum)...they still have 2 more lynches we need to get.  It makes no sense why they would all go in one basket.  I know for a fact that I would want to go in the OPPOSITE basket if I was scum in this situatio (Ie bussing).   Therefore, assuming Titus+Gamma are scum together, that would mean Lalight or FF are the bussers here.  An interesting thing is that if Tammy AND lalight are both scum, that would mean that Transcend is 100% town, due to lack of power roles for the town.  If FF is the one bussing, that would make sense- FF, Tammy, Gamma- but that post frozenflame just made is really convincing to me and to me seemed to show real emoition.  I was scumreading FF earlier but I forget why<br><br>2) Transcend has been fucking buddyin me the entire game, saying he TR me earlier, trying to pocket me, the weird wagon switch to the person I wanted to lynch, like he has been connecting himself with me all game.  I also had a strong scumreading on transcend basically for these things before he claimed even night SOMETHING which immediately made me want to trust him.  But now he just did it again- \"If I die...mulch is town 100%\".  WTF?  It's like blatant and I think he could easily think I am some idiot noob would would love to be taken advantage of my a smart scum.  <br><br>My problem with Transcend being scum, though is a lot:<br>1) This would mean that if Tammy is scum (which I am almost sure), he would be bussing (which is okay). <br>2)  Why is gamma not doing anything to defend herself?"}

Pretty frustrated that you checked me tbh LaLight, I thought my play yesterday was pretty fucking obvtown being #2 on the GE lynch after Trans.

Frankly the fact that you picked me just makes me extra paranoid about you considering all you've had for us all game are innos. Conveniently clearing my, imo obvtown since yesterday slot versus going after someone more questionable (i.e. didn't vote/bus GE). Ugh.<br><br>Titus how exactly is ryker confscum from your perspective? Really need you to explain that more explicitly. Ryker crossvote is interesting. Technically we're out of blitz range at 4v2 though so not quite as conclusive might normally be the case here.<br><br>Is there any particular reason why we ought not no lynch today? Trans investigation is on deck again so pressure is on scum to remove that threat and give us another flip to work with else face possible results again. I feel like this option really needs to be discussed.<br><br>Titus and ryker are both gross af to me right now but need to slow this down a bit and think now that we finally have a scum flip. Don't expect much from me for the rest of the night, big smash tourney stream will have my attention.

Doesn't play the game as intended. Didn't read, was spewing things that could be dispelled easily by reading (possibility of scum Ran), was hounding me about how townies act with bullshit statements that don't hold true to the game (scum sell, town solves, why me = fry me). With the way Lalight has been posting about my slot for the entire game, Titus's opinion of my slot, Ran starting the phase going back on me, and all around people just keeping me high in the lynch pool, I didn't see much of a point to continuing the game if I was just gonna die a week or two later and lose the game if we were correct. I'm still pretty much just ready for the game to be over with.<br><br>I voted you over Gamma based on my opinion that the set-up shouldn't have both your role and Lalight's. Even-night Gunsmith is a much more convoluted role and easier to claim after an odd night role has been claimed.

All-in-all, the decision between which one to lynch was still a pretty large crap shoot from my PoV."}

Everyone (including me) was expecting him to check Titus.  FrozenFlame had made very townie posts in the past few days, and it makes zero sense to want to check him.  This is the first red flag.

Your not heavily in disbelief?  Your not even going to comment that you believe it?  That's ALL your going to say?  <span class=\"noboldsig\">Here is why Lalight is scum:  a townie would push him for this, like I did.

He is really resolute.  Yet, somehow, his great position on this changes <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9282796#p9282796\">here</a>.   This is bad yet it get's worse.  The REASON he changes is because Transcend said he wanted to gamesolve and would get nightkilled.  Therfore, with that post, Lalight is <span class=\"noboldsig\">agreeing that we should not lynch because we want Transcend's solving ability.</span>.  Transcend's solving ability is SO great that it would change his already huge postiiton on no lynching.  Would this NOT suggest that he thinks Transcend is town?  <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9282618#p9282618\">Apparently not</a>, or <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9282855#p9282855\">not</a>, or <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9282997#p9282997\">not</a>.  <span class=\"noboldsig\">Yes, Lalight changed his position on this because he thought we needed Transcend's gamesolving so badly yet apparently thinks he could be mafia</span>.<br><br>Let's get onto his vote on me.  Let's not forget that this is LyLo, so although I can't technically prove to all of you that he wanting to lynch me will end the game, to ME it is basically a scumclaim.  So, here is how it goes.<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9279469#p9279469\">Apparently the scum team is me and Titus</a> (remember that he did not even press Titus for forgetting a neighborization).  <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9279477#p9279477\">This is his \"scumread\"</a> on me.  I am going to quote it here, just for everyone to clearly see:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9266143#p9266143\" class=\"postlink\">post 2384</a>, LaLight wrote:</cite>I am starting heavily scumreading Mulch for his undying wish to hear the claim from Transcend, I would say only scum would do such a thing, because they are really nervous. Also \"Scum always votes first in LyLo\" lol. Not really. But this vote for Tammy was bad. And scum also likes to highlight \"we're in LyLo\" because there's no way we wouldn't figure out ourselves and scum must've discussed it. So yeah, Mulch is relaxed scummo for sure.</div></blockquote><br><br>Yup.  His huge scumread, his overpowering scumread for me that is causing him (theoretically him as townie) to vote me in LyLo is:  I was relaxed last round.  Wow.  Oh, and apparently <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9279510#p9279510\">This</a> too, which consists of Gamma shading me the entire game (something I should have picked up on, admitadly), also is hard core incriminating LyLo evidence.  <br><br>Throughout this, he is <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9279488#p9279488\">very resolute</a> about lynching me (yes, even as he is simeoultaneously pushing for a no lynch), <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9282931#p9282931\">very</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9282944#p9282944\">very</a>, resolute.<br><br>Yet, throughout all this hard core scumreading me for being relaxed, he also feels the need to keep his options open.  <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9279482#p9279482\">Titus/Ryker?</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9279510#p9279510\">Titus/Mulch?</a> <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9282642#p9282642\">Ryker/Mulch?</a>.  Yes, he apparently is thinking those are \"possibilties\" as well despite voting ME.  <br><br>So now let's go onto <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9282828#p9282828\">His vote on Titus</a>.  This would be a good thing, actually, to me, considering that he shaded him earlier in the day, (although refsues to press him on not submitting a neighborization), yet within a minute or two <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9282852#p9282852\">HE UNVOTES</a>, and backs this up using the <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9282855#p9282855\">worst logic in the history of the world</a>, saying, that he thinks ME AND TRANSCEND ????  are a scum team together.  <span class=\"noboldsig\">This is the look of a scum that was LOOKING for an excuse to unvote Titus, either because they are scum partners or because he thinks I would be an easier target</span>.  Also, his reason for this unprecendeted scumread is that he <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9282868#p9282868\">\"can\"</a> doubt someone if he wants to.

I had a crazy busy day today and didn't get a chance to do the reading I wanted to do. Going to try to get through it as fast as I can but I have another busy day tomorrow so finding the optimal play here is definitely a WIP for me. Apologies if people are trying to wrap this game up quick but frankly I'd feel like I was truly throwing the game if I didn't pace myself here. If im gonna fuck this up and throw the game, I want to atleast be able to say I tried my best and didn't get lazy under pressure.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Mod: Official vote count &amp; deadline post asap please? Would be much obliged </span><br><br>Transcend, gonna be honest bro right now I have you as my strongest townread. If you need to talk shit out with me lets do it. From my surface level read of today I'm not picking up on any specific questions directed at me but you've said you want to hear from me. Just lay it down and Ill get @ you.<br><br>Generally I'm still a bit confused as to why no lynching here isn't the play. For starters we overall get a more robust mathematical advantage. Going from 4-2 to 3-2 risk free is a free (.4-.33)% edge. Why not force scum to move and rule out potential scum combos? And plus the payoff for no lynch now is even greater than the mere odds edge by virtue of info production pressure. Going into night 4 scum have pressure to:<br><br>- Kill me as a townread cop clear (I present as a nonviable endgame lynch target and thus must be dealt with else be a necessary persuasion target)<br><br>- Kill Transcend who pressures via gunsmith claim<br><br>- Kill Titus (if they're concerned about losing titus as a viable mislynch when getting confirmation of her inheritance of her ability would stand in stark contrast to all the convenient fuck ups)<br><br>With so much split pressure, forcing the scum to move gives us more info re: what they actually fear and thus what their likely envision path to endgame is. And again, we gain all of this information at no cost. Yes, we lose likely a strong and useful town voice in me or transcend, but still, the info gained will only stand to benefit the surviving party. If transcend is scum then I've pretty much come to terms with the fact that I've been outplayed by an insane bus gambit and that's that. So basically what I'm saying is I don't see any particularly prejudicial to the town wincon to sacrifice a single town voice for all of these informational and odds benefits. Plus if we mandate titus targets me with her ability overnight and trans checks titus, we're guaranteed to get info re: that slot. If I live you get cleared info that her ability works or doesnt. If I die, trans can clear/condemn titus. Guaranteed info like that going into true 3-2 lylo could be absolutely crucial and really force the scum's hand assuming we succeed in lynching scum D5.<br><br>Basically unless someone can give me a VERY compelling, well explained reason why town stands to gain some sort of advantage by going all in, against the odds and free information, and trying to nail the scum lynch here and then just NLing to get a 2-1 lylo, that's where my vote goes for now<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: No Lynch</span><br><br>I'm completely down to talk about whatever needs to be discussed before we lose a useful voice, but still I think the mathematical and information advantages are silly to pass up when town seems to have power tempo this game.<br><br>Don't take this post as me absolutely refusing to lynch today. I can be persuaded but I honestly just can't see how that's optimal play here. If someone can demonstrate what we stand to lose by going the NL lynch route, I'll certainly reconsider. I need more time to ISO GE and re-read yesterday so get a handle on how his wagon evolved. Really having a hard time deciding what the bus situation likely was."}

We sacrifice the .4 - .33 statistical edge and all of the potential scum teams that people might compose with me and you in them despite what I would argue is our cleared status. We also sacrifice potentially going into 3 - 2 with two \"cleared\" townies. If I die, you can check Titus which resolves that slot putting you in a position to nail a 2/3 chance to lynch scum D5. If you die, I'm basically in the same position except instead of a gun-check result on Titus I get to confirm whether or not she actually got the neighborizer power and thus whether she actually is a backup of some sort, which leans heavily town here IMO. Therefore, I'm in the same position to hit scum with a 2/3 chance between ryker, mulch, and lalight. Not bad odds at all.<br><br>So yes town uses someone useful in either you or me, but frankly can you really say that just having quick lynch protection and being able to communicate live during lylo decision making is worth setting up for a 2/3 shot in lylo? I mean, if titus is bad, our plan basically confirms we out her for D5 which is a free pass into 2 - 1 endgame. So yeah I'm really having a hard time seeing whats gained by taking a game ending chance at far worse odds right now. Yes, eventually we'll have to \"all in\" but you always have to in lylo, which is unavoidable. If we have a pressure release valve option before having to all in, and we can optimize our chances before the all in, why not do so? And yes though being able to avoid quicklynch is handy if people are feeling particularly jumpy, but Id like to believe that no townie in their right mind would go into D5 3 - 2 and just slap down a vote without realizing they were risking a quickhammer if their vote is TvT. I mean that's just basic endgame awareness, I don't think that's too much to ask for or expect from players here. Not to mention the added advantage of knowing definitively whether you have a TvS or SvS crossvote when someone votes in 3 - 2 and there's no quick hammer.<br><br>Anyway, not trying to be stubborn here but I'm just honestly still unpersuaded that we ought make the potentially game ending call right now. I don't see what unique advantage we have just by virtue of transcend and I both being alive and able to vote when we make the decision, versus us discussing who we think the final scum team combos could be, contingent on info we can get on titus, and then trusting the survivor to make the much easier call in 3 - 2, or just nail the free scum lynch upon guilty confirmation."}

Transcend- Literally an utter god, he carried the scumteam.  He was slick under pressure, crumbed an awesome fakeclaim, was aggresive enough to push for a lynch in MyLo, had great nightkills, and consoled me when I was panicking.  A+++.  Also taught me some things about helping out your scumbuddies; he TR me day 1 without fear and all throughout the end of the game, and we both never died.  <br>2.  Marshy- You have such a reputation of being a good player that we needed to kill you lol.  We knew youw ould figure us out eventually.  You didn't seem too invested in this game (or maybe that's your playstyle) but you ended up being an early nightkill as VT, which is all you could ask.<br>3.  Mulch- ME!<br>4.  LaLaight- A+++ reads, you called out the scumteam way before anyone else and had the guts to do it.  You sort of acted scummy in general as town this game but your logic and reads were on point.<br>5. Firescreamer- I think that you played fine, I never actually understood why the town wanted to lynch you lol.  I think maybe you could be a bit more confident in game and that would gain you more town cred.<br>6. Sparkles- You pushed me early!  Very nice game I would say, again I don't know why town didn't like your posts, you were very obv town to me.   Perhaps be a bit more confident. <br>7. Zulfy- I really apologize for calling you Wulfy!  I promise it was a 100% tactical move and not anything to personally insult you.  I think you played fine; actually, you scurmead me REALLY early lol.  I don't personally like the +1 things but if it works for you (like it did this game), then good.<br>8.  Ranmaru- So clearly obvtotwn it hurt, and you stimulated the discussion a LOT.  I think if the town was more active you would have had an even greater effect.  You missed a little on your reads, and sort of fell for my buddying, but tbh you were so obvs town that it dwared any of your downfalls.<br>9.  FrozenFlame- An amazing strategical and analytical mind, you almost won game for town by going nolynch.  I think that maybe if you went with your gut a little more you would have a ton of success, you seemed to me (at least) to be the smartest person in this game except maybe Transcend.<br>10.  Ryker- You will see the mafia chat: I said I think you could see right into my soul.  I LOVE your playstyle and aggresiveness!  You stuck with your guts and I think that is such a great thing in other games.  I would be terrified to see you as scum, and I think your pretty smart too.<br>11. Adumbro- Well, you got Transcend.  I would just say not to underestimate newbies so much! lol.  You did your job, night 1 day kill as VT.  Nothing more you could want.<br>12. Titus- Tammy- Tammy you were funny and smart, but you had to be replaced.  Titus- maybe don't be so focused on only one set of circumstances, but I can't really blame you there.  to me, you made yourself obvtown when you forget a neighborization, as scum would just make one up.  <br>13.  Gamma-  NICE PLAY!  I loved your distancing to both me AND transcend; it helped late game.  YOu played the bus just right and helped me out with Transcend day 1.  You also had a cool way of going unnoticed yet seeming to be active that I envy.  Nice!"}

Your entrance was bleh but it got better and you tried. Nothing too scummy, you were able to use Gamma to convince me of you being town when you weren't. <br><br>marshy*<br>Mulch<br>LaLight<br><br>Hey Lalight. I disagree with you playing so scummy that you get attention towards you. It allowed scum to leave you alive and push for you D4 without any repercussion, even though me giving you suspicion also helped that which is also my bad. I'd rather you lay low and be null or null-town rather than just scummy. Frozen Flame yelled at me though and he disagrees I guess. Still, no reason for you to have a bad entrance as a PR. I also think that you should remain in thread a bit longer. Sometimes you say 'going to sleep' without saying good bye and asking 'hey i'm leaving anyone have any questions before I go?' You kind of plopped a vote on Titus and allowed scum to strike, you should at least have talked to others for thoughts before the day. Honestly you vote too willy nilly in these situations, you did the same thing in D3 bro. Have you ever been in lylo? Pretend you are conf town in lylo, would you want that happening? Anyway, it's cool, I hope you learn to be more cautious with voting in the future. I will give you that you had good night play, you targetted peeps that needed to be targetted. You are cool, sorry if I or others bothered you we kind of scum read you all game haha.<br><br>FireScreamer<br><br>I want you to try more in future games. I can understand you LAMISTING but that isn't enough. You obviously were not town enough since you were lynched and you seemed like scum just trying to lurk through. If you were more active and contributing more I'd be happy to work with you on your scumreads. Just asking 'anyone voting Lalight?' isn't enough bro. I'm sorry you felt down though, that happens and I hope you feel better next tme.<br><br>Agent Sparkles*<br><br>I'm sorry I shot you mid-day while you had things to say. What sparked my decision was Lalight coming out, so I wanted to shoot scum to make up for that but I just fucked it up further. As I said in dead thread land, I think your only problem was your schedule. As long as you know to follow up with things then that should be good. I hope you are able to be more active in the future, I know you would be a great asset in the future and I would love to bounce reads with you. I'd prefer to be a VT or neighbor or something instead haha that vig power goes to my head. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\"><br><br>Zulfy<br><br>Zulfy I want more from you in your town game, straight up bro. It seems you were procrastinating due to school, and I can understand that. I have been through that, many people have been through that, but you were the D1 lynch because of that. I want you to put in more time into mafia if you can, and stop making ugly ass 1+ posts. Your 1+ thing is cool but please make it neat. Also, if you  have school and time is tight, simply don't play (not being mean here, being realistic). I won't play a game if I don't have time. You need time to be able to play the game well. You were practically almost replaced but for some reason came back and still kind of lurked. I want you to improve on that in the future. <br><br>Ranmaru<br><br>I'm aware I fucked up the game with my shot. I'm open to hearing what I should have done with my role instead. First time vig.

But I can get if you weren't sure who was scum, I wasn't either at that point.<br><br>Ryker<br><br>Yo, sorry if I frustrated you. I actually was really concerned with you because I was expecting you to be part of the crazy gambit shit as scum but I simply underestimated Transcend here. I've only seen your scum game once.

I know you and Marshy are salty about my shot, sorry about that. <br><br>Titus<br><br>Thanks for replacing in. I know you don't read much upon replacing in anyway and I considered that risk, since we needed a replacement. Then I started to think you were scum, meh I dunno. Anyway it was fun playing with you. <br><br>Gamma<br><br>Lol you won this time! Lmao I guess you did the thing again but this time you didn't just replace in and make it seem all weird.

SWF leading up to the creation of Dgames as a separate subforum from Forum Games and then for a couple years thereafter was by far the most competitive mafia community I've ever played in. Not that MS here doesn't have quality players, but on SWF there was very little low level play and thus the overall quality of play was not at all diluted. Unfortunately, just by virtue of the much larger community size here, that dilution phenomenon takes place here and in many other communities.<br><br>SWF just had sooooo many heavy hitters and they would always be in games together by virtue of the fact that high level players were the plurality of players. I remember the golden age of Dgames very fondly. So many great personalities with intellect and a competitive mindset to boot. Not all that surprising considering most people who take smash bros games seriously enough to join and actively post on a site devoted almost entirely to competitive play are going to bring that same mindset to mafia. The nature of smashboards itself was self selecting for people who enjoy learning games with depth and take playing to wincon seriously."}
