Site rules may be found <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=6470\" class=\"postlink\">here</a> for reference. Note that playing to win condition is a requirement.<br>\n02. The rules are subject to change at my discretion to correct any errors or omissions. Should any changes be implemented, they will be announced in the same format as the original rule (for example, changes to the main set of rules will be announced in the main thread; changes to role-specific rules will be sent by PM).<br>\n03. Pretending to violate any of these rules will be treated the same as an actual violation.<br>\n04. Everyone is here to have fun, and I hope that we will all keep this in mind throughout the game. Please contact me directly (by PM) with any problems or questions. In the event that I make an error, please call it to my attention by PM or by addressing me in the relevant thread (<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">I will look for &#8220;@Mod&#8221;</div>).<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Posting</div></div><br>\n05. Players should use English exclusively, without any form of hidden or encoded text.<br>\n06. Once I have declared a player to be dead, that player should not post in the main thread until I have declared the game to be over.<br>\n07. Players should not provide direct quotations from, images of, or other provable references to any game-related PM or PT.<br>\n08. Players should not use any form of provable randomness for any reason.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Timing</div></div><br>\n09. Each Day Phase will last 240 hours. Each Night Phase will last 48 hours. Deadlines may be extended at my discretion as necessary to ensure that the game continues smoothly. Any such extension will be announced in the main thread.<br>\n10. Players who have not posted in 48 consecutive hours will receive a prod. After receiving a prod, a player has 24 hours to post before I will begin seeking a replacement. Players on V/LA will be exempt from these prod requirements; however, if a player requires an extensive period of V/LA, I may determine that the game would be better served by a replacement and replace that player at my discretion.<br>\n11. Players who do not make sufficient attempt to participate (including--but not limited to--players who require repeated prods) may be replaced at my discretion.<br>\n12. If a player being replaced for inactivity should return to the game before a replacement is found, that player may be allowed to continue in the game at my discretion. However, once a player has been replaced, that player may not continue in the game.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Day Phase</div></div><br>\n13. Players may vote to lynch another player using either vote tags or bold tags as demonstrated below.<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Name</span><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: Name</div><br>\nIn order to be counted, votes should appear on a separate line and not within spoiler tags or otherwise concealed. Votes not following this format may be counted if I believe that a vote was intended.<br>\n14. When one player has achieved a majority of votes (more living players voting for that player than living players not voting for that player), that player will be lynched and the phase will end. If the deadline is reached before a lynch is achieved, no player will be lynched.<br>\n15. Players may vote to end the phase without a lynch. An example of such a vote is given below:<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: No Lynch</span><br>\nIf the number of living players voting for this option is greater than or equal to the number of living players not voting for this option, the phase will end without a lynch and the game will proceed directly to Night Phase.<br>\n16. Players may continue to post in the main thread until I have announced the end of the phase, regardless of whether or not a lynch has occurred.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Game Design</div></div><br>\n17. In addition to the site-wide rules, it may be useful to review the <a href=\"http://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Normal_Game\" class=\"postlink\">Normal Game guidelines</a> and the <a href=\"http://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Natural_Action_Resolution/Normal_Game\" class=\"postlink\">Natural Action Resolution guidelines</a>.<br>\n18. Any PT associated with this game will be open for use at all times (Day Phase and Night Phase). <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Every PT related to this game will be made public after the game is over, although I will redact posts by player request.</div><br>\n19. No player may perform more than one action during a single Night Phase.<br>\n20. At least one player will receive the following role:\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div> Welcome, (player), to Mini Normal 1905!<br>\n<br>\nYour role is Citizen, aligned with <div style=\"display:inline;color:green\">Town</div>.<br>\n<br>\nAbilities: You have no special abilities.<br>\n<br>\nVictory: You win if all living players are aligned with Town.</div></blockquote>", "time": "Sat Apr 29, 2017 8:37 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=71640&start=0", "forum": "53", "thread": "71640"}

Let me sum your contribution so far:<br>\n- shitposting entire page 1<br>\n- saying the people on your wagon are scum<br>\n- when I say to policy lynch you, and also say it's not serious, you act like I'm scumreading you by saying \"lol shitposting=scum\" sarcastic remark<br>\n- you respond by calling me scum for correctly pointing out the holes in your logic, which turns my joke vote I was willing to take off had you responded normallly, into an actual serious vote and scumread <br>\n<br>\nNo way I'm going to bandwagon a policy lynch unserious bandwagon as scum when my teammate already did so who you already called out.... say we're scum pushing you as a mislynch, what happens after you flip?

When I voted flubber for joining the wagon instead of voting others, gamma also voted there.  The problem is, when I was voting rb and questioned him directly, gamma was hard in rb' s corner.  <br>\n<br>\nSo I see a pairing with gamma and rb.  My problem is that I SR gamma in every game I've played with them, and they've always flipped town.  I can vote them with confidence anymore because of it.  I could vote rb, but I dont see flash wagons (even though it wasn't a serious wagon) happening on scum D1 much.

I can see where it's gonna lead, because egos.  Will only help scum, since my guess is scum either haven't posted yet or haven't said much at all.  Boonskies may be the more aggressive scumster, but that still leaves two others at least.  Also, Boonskies calling everyone that ADd them town doesn't sit well with me.  It's calculated.  Buttering me up won't work anymore than discrediting or deflecting will work.  The points for you here are that I think most (if not all) scum haven't made their entrance yet. <br>\n<br>\nOf the scum team, one is usually active/aggressive/tries to be a town leader, two are almost always gonna be players who hang in the background, while one will be the prod dodging lurker for 90% of the game.  So who are those players currently?  I think we have to assume 3 scum here and move to 4 only for lylo/mylo reasons or if the game doesn't end, so I will assume theres one aggressive scum and two lurkerish ones (Which happens in almost every game).<br>\n<br>\nPlayers<br>\n01. choof - posted/active. He's a TR<br>\n<br>\n02. CooLDoG - he posted once in RVS.  Voted rb saying spam.  Has done nothing since then.  Null, although gut scum read.<br>\n<br>\n03. Gamma Emerald - posted/active.  Null TR I guess <br>\n<br>\n04. Boonskiies - posted/active.  My aggressive scum SR (for now)<br>\n<br>\n05. Biochemist - posted once in RVS. Has done nothing since.  Null.<br>\n<br>\n06. Michael Lee - this guy is town.  He even built a small case before voting rb.  Maybe my strongest TR.<br>\n<br>\n07. Kasumeat - who is this? Have they posted at all?<br>\n<br>\n08. Melanora - posted twice saying they're so VLA that they never can play on any days at all, because they're super VLA and they gave an official post explaining why they SR whomever looked easiest to mislynch,then went VLA again cuz guys.. they're super BLA.  Very important player here to be so VLA that they give one 'Official' post.  Maybe this is Donald Trump's MS username.  Theyre unavailable when at MaraLaga.  No Wi-Fi you see.<br>\n<br>\n09. Tywin Lannister -I know I'm town but whatever I never lurk even as scum, so you'd have to peg me as the aggressive scum player if you truly SR me. There's always one, but usually only one.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n10. Backhand - posted once in rvs. Null, but gut TR.  Maybe due to their tone.<br>\n<br>\n11. Flubbernugget - first post was 4th slot on the fake rb wagon.  They defended themselves ok after though, and continued to question why rb isn't considered scum.  Null read I think.  Not enough said for me to pick a stance.<br>\n<br>\n12. TheFuzzylogic99 - hasn't posted at all, and if they play like the last time I've played with them, they will lurk and prod dodge the entire game.  Smh<br>\n<br>\n13. rb - TR because hes been playing so suboptimal that if scum, he's bound to be caught eventually.  I just can't see him being legit scum playing so badly. *shrug* plus with everyone willing to vote him, it means he's the low hanging fruit here.  Scum aren't usually lynchbait.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n@boonskies: I understand playstyles pretty well, which is why I TR him here.  I think his playstyle is suboptimal at best, and calling half the playerbase scum without reason, posting one liners over and over in quadruple posts to fluff up the game, never giving anything of substance, making yourself lynchbait or even a PL by being annoying, and never even once looking for scum means his play is not good for town.  I can understand plenty of things while strongly disagreeing with it.  <br>\n<br>\nWhy are you buttering everyone up Boonskies?  You're doing that for rb here by defending him.  Doing it to me by calling me town.  You're trying to get on specific player's good sides, and it's obvious.  I wonder who your buddies are?

Prepare for the loudest 1v1 you've ever had.</div></blockquote>\n\nThat was a fast switch in stance.  Its almost OMGUS like.  We won't go there though, since the same can be said about my vote on Boonskies.  So what I will question is how Boonskies goes from saying 'i won't vote you tywin' and 'tywin gets town points' to saying 'tywin is caught scum' in a matter of 14 posts.<br>\n<br>\nSo what happened in between?  I called Boonskies out by saying he's buttering me and rb up by calling us town.  If he legit TR me, 14 posts wouldn't have changed that.  If he legit SRs me, 14 posts before wouldn't have been saying I'm a TR.<br>\n<br>\nSo what gives Boonskies?  Quite a fast 180 you did, especially when you say you aren't emotionally compromised or freaking out. <br>\n<br>\nSo what made you change your mind so drastically?  You went from a TR to a SR with hard discrediting and mocking. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\nAs for saying my reads are fabricated, how do you figure?  Half the game hasn't posted more than once (if at all), so I have null reads on everyone.  What I'm looking for is to see what changes from the less than active players when they finally make an entrance, and I wanna see who they vote for.  Making this a 1v1 means they either choose one of us, or they ignore it entirely and go elsewhere.  Ignoring it entirely means if one of us flips scum, those players now have motive to look at.  If they vote the person who flips town, then again, we have VCA and info for the future.  The only way this doesn't work is if they bus their buddy or if we are both town, and in that scenario, bussing a buddy on D1 is a win for town.  So the tvt is the only negative here, but I certainly wouldn't vote you if i TR you, and I doubt you'd vote me if you TR me.  So either one of us is scum or we both have bad reads right now.  Regardless, info is gained, and the lurker players are put on notice.  <br>\n<br>\nI'll address the rest soon.", "time": "Sun Apr 30, 2017 8:26 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=71640&start=300", "forum": "53", "thread": "71640"}

Its usually pretty hard to lynch me unless I am VLA, but scum certainly try.  The last time I was actually lynched, it was a Titus death tunnel that occurred over 4 days and never stopped even when scum basically claimed and I had pegged them from D1.  Titus wanted to lose over not getting me lynched, and managed a quicklynch when the day started and i wasnt around to post.  It was one lynch from lylo too.  She tried to lose the game for town with her death tunnel, never managed to find even a single scum, my reads were proven mostly right, and she still complained post game.  So good luck lynching me.  If I have to hop on my laptop to refute everything you claim, I will, but I'm usually on my phone, and it takes time to read 50 freak out posts that you made.  It's obvious to me that you're trying way too hard to get rid of a dangerous player for you (calls you out and DRs you on D1) but you won't be able to without outting yourself and maybe even your buddies as scum.

I think he's scum, but there's no guilty result in him.  I don't have flips to associate him with.  I think his freak out by posting so erratically after I called him out comes from scum.  He's said how well he does when scum, which says he has an ego.  If he rolled scum here and got lynched D1 (and he claims to never have been lynched or lost a game as scum) then its a HUGE ego blow to him.  Following me?<br>\n<br>\nSo now imagine he tried buddying two main players here.  One is the lynchbait who may flip D1 in RB.  If RB is town and Boonskies scim, and if he assumes rb will be lynched, it benefits him to buddy the lynchbait and get town cred after he flips.  He can also then go after whomever he wants on the RB wagon.  Now go to me.  He originally called me newbscum, and did so by sheeping rb.  When I questioned it, he switched to saying I have town points and he won't vote me.  It's a way to buddy me.  It's obvious I'm a belligerent player in general, so him getting on my good side is good for !scumBoonskies.  It takes away a lot of pressure.  Still following?<br>\n<br>\nSo then I called him out on it.  I said he's buddying  (I said buttering up if you want exact wording), and said I SR him.  Then I went off on my general theory of the common scum playstyles and archetypes, and I fit Boonskies as the aggressive slot.  <br>\n<br>\nSo within 14 posts, Boonskies went from saying i get town cred and he won't vote me to saying I'm conf scum and he wants to death tunnel.  Then he starts posting an absolute shit ton in a very short tomespan, shows common scum tactics (discredit, deflect, mock, ignore, cherry pick, etc), and even goes so far as to use AtE to get others to push me too.

Boonskies was thinking you townish before you posted this, then he flipped to SRing you after you did. Your case is that because he SR you after you made a bunch of garbage posts, that makes him scum. That's why your case is garbage.</div></blockquote>\n\nThat's not my entire case?  You should try reading.  There's more to it than that.  Regardless,its DAY ONE.  Capitalized it for you, just in case you have an eyesight issue.  <br>\n<br>\nWhat cases do you expect to see on D1?  Also, why are you ignoring his freak out? He flipped his shit over one vote.  Then he tried to convince me he's town while still SRing me? Who the fuck tries to convince their SEx that they're town?  You do that with TRs, not SRs. What town flips out over one vote on D1?  What town do people hard defend and pushback for after one vote on D1?<br>\n<br>\nDo you understand anything that I'm getting at here?  He's not town, because nobody will vote him or even read him at all but me, multiple players have hard defended him on D1 without cause or reason, he's contradicted himself many times both by saying meta is useless and he manipulates it to then posting meta over and over, then he tries convincing me he's town even though he thinks I'm scum (claims to think that anyway, but he doesn't and its obvious)?  <br>\n<br>\nAre you reading the game at all?  Do you not read between the lines at all?  I'm confused how you think you've the ability to call me a bad player when you've done nothing except defend an unconfirmed player on D1, while ignoring absolutely all the relevant parts of the interaction between him and I.</div></blockquote>\n\nHere's Tywin's really scummy post.

Good try. <br>\n<br>\nNow since being an adult is purely subjective and a mindset rather than age  (or I think I'd pass most of you and be the only adult here), let's get down to basics of what you've been doing, shall we?<br>\n<br>\n You are fence sitting, even now.  You haven't voted, because why? You said you'll only vote when you are 100% sure of scum, but sorry friend, that's impossible.  Only scum have any ability to pretend certainty.  Town, at least in D1, couldn't and certainly shouldn't be 100% on anything.  You shouldnt know, so what exactly are you waiting for? <br>\n<br>\nLet me explain what I think.  You don't like the flub wagon, because he may be your scum buddy.  Let's ignore boon, since you two aren't directly associated.  So you see town on your buddy and wonder what to do.  There must be another safe bet for you to land on and/or hammer, right?  Do you fence sit, waiting for someone else to make a move you can sheep.  You won't do it for flubber though, because he's your scum buddy.<br>\n<br>\nNow, if I'm wrong, I'm wrong.  That will be found out sooner or later.  What I do know is that you haven't done shit, haven't made a case on anyone, only seem to SR the lynchbait players and/or me since I keep calling you out, and all you're capable of doing is insulting, mocking, ignoring, and discrediting rather than making a legitimate case and actually choosing a side here.

Either he's the most obvious scum in the world, or I really question how people are so ignorant about how this game is played and won as town.  Claims are there for a reason.  So are CCs.  <br>\n<br>\nSo kasumat is obvious scum I think.  There's no getting around it.  If not, ill enjoy watching him get lynched after my flip regardless.  Town don't see cop claims without a cc on D1, hammer them anyways, and not make scum NK them.  It just doesn't happen. It's terrible play.  Talk about suboptimal play...<br>\n<br>\nKasumat, remember when you whined about suboptimal play?  Nice bluff bud. You obv didn't know what that even meant, did you?

It's too obvious now.  Forget boon, forget Mel.  You pushing hard to hammer a cop claim on D1 with no CC, while not even considering that at all is so suboptimal that I can't see how you are town.  Nobody is that bad on this site.  It's common sense.<br>\n<br>\nFirst: if I was faking a claim, someone would cc it for one. <br>\n<br>\nSecondly, it's D1 so you never gamble on a cop claim D1. That's also common sense.  You should learned this in your newbie games.  <br>\n<br>\nThird, assuming scum don't have a roleblocker, they have no choice but to NK me tonight.  Leaving me alive to clear or incriminate anyone is unacceptable for scum.  I'm the obvious choice to die tonight.  <br>\n<br>\nFour: if scum do have a rokeblocker, you force them on me.  This saves some other PR to do whatever it is they do.  Maybe a doc saves someone. Who knows.<br>\n<br>\nFive: I was first player to L1 out of anyone.  My counter wagon is flubber, who you all refused to look at and went to me hoping to take out obv town.

Only scum still vote a cop claim without a cc.  You're obviously not so bad that you cant see this.

There are many variations of cops: alignment cop, role cop, for example. Claiming which one was not relevant for the situation (Him obviously not d1 claiming -&gt; a wagon forming on him quickly -&gt; him being at L-1 and needing a claim ASAP to stop it). In fact, it's a townread, because I expect scum to have their fakeclaims ready and to not mess them up like that. What reason did he have to change his claim again? Why is it a scummy thing to do? The fact he's not counterclaimed confirms him. Why do you want to lynch a cop without leaving him alive and putting scum for the task? If he's scum, we'll catch him at LYLO/MYLO when we have more information (and he's likely dead if he's town, or in some way confirmed either way or another). Killing him now and having him flip town will be extemely terrible.

On the first lynch, I was right (Sobolev being scum and I stated hammer intend). On the second lynch, I hard defended (Chickadee flipped town). On the third lynch, I hard defended (Theta flipped town). Only on the fourth lynch was I wrong, because I scumread someone who completely melted down, turned into a complete rage mode and starting insulting me uncontrollable after receiving literally 1 vote from me (with reasons provided), while ignoring the reasons at hand and he turned into a complete shitfest where he self-voted literally 5 times and keept screaming about how not scum he was. Blame me for tunneling him for that meltdown which, in 99% of cases, is a scum meltdown, from my PoV. He was a new player, apparently he felt pressure as a townie where townies shouldn't have felt that amount of pressure. He didn't defend himself rationally at all. Oh well. Really after you being wrong on 3 people (Algortim, myself and chickadee - who you have tunneled into oblivion, and outright defending sobolev who was scum) get off with your bad reads, you were only right on Shannon but if I flip a coin and keep tunneling the person it lands on, I will be right every now and then as well. You know what your&#233; saying is complete BS, it was a  newbie game and I learned what not to do, we saw a town cop make a fake guilty claim that resulted into a town mislynch, and we saw the last townie giving up at MYLO by self hammering. I have moved on from the game. Can you? <br>\n<br>\nI backed off from Penguin being scum before he got nightkilled. So I was wrong on Shannon, so what, is this your argument that I am now always wrong? Get the fuck out of here. Wait, didn't you scumread me first? Or are you trying to convince me?

I was pretty sure who I wanted to lynch, but now not so much, but anyways...<br>\n<br>\n@everyone convinced, pre-TL claiming, that TL is town<br>\nWhy do you think that TL is lying? Why do you think that a town person would actually lie? Why is that okay?<br>\n<br>\n@Michael<br>\nWhere did Boon lie? Why are you ignoring the fact that TL lied repeatedly?<br>\nAlso, please explain the Kasu scum thing, because I think I missed that, and I'm not really town reading Kasu but also not scum reading, so I want to see what you're seeing.<br>\n<br>\n@Why<br>\nI think you're my top town read in general, so I would like to hear your opinion.<br>\n<br>\n@Tywin<br>\nWhy have you lied repeatedly in this game? Why do you refuse to respond to anyone that calls you out for lying? Why would you offer to die if you are a TI?<br>\n<br>\n@RB<br>\nIf you are so convinced that Flub and TL will flip scum, do you think they are scum buddies? Where is your post explaining why they are scum? You just say they are scum, but not why.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nHere's the point that I'm at.<br>\n<br>\nMost of the posts that TL has made are not something that a Cop, or Role Cop, or whatever, would say. He wanted to lynch himself, basically self-voting, to prove that Boon was scum??? That makes no sense, particularly when TL could check him tonight, and if Boon did come back as scum, then TL could pull that whole thing. TL flipping town wouldn't confirm Boon as scum in the slightest.<br>\n<br>\nFurthermore, TL has lied repeatedly, changing and distorting things that have happened in this game. That's scummy AF. Town shouldn't be lying about anything like that. Furthermore, TL has ignored anyone that called him out for lying.<br>\n<br>\nAnd finally, the TL wagon has stood strong, while multiple other wagons have happened around it. The fact that the TL wagon hasn't wavered has me really thinking that his scum buddies are trying to start any other lynch possible.<br>\n<br>\nThat stated, I don't want to lynch a cop claim. That's just stupid. You don't do that. I said it early on in this day phase, that I would not want to lynch TL D1, and would prefer to get results back on him during night. Problem is, if TL is Town, then TL is the one that would check. So...<br>\n<br>\nFurthermore, I gotta be honest... if TL IS Town, and IS whatever cop he's claiming today, I wouldn't trust his results if he came back saying someone is scum. I wouldn't. He has already lied repeatedly in this game. <br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Tywin Lannister</span><br>\n<br>\nNow, this vote will change, if I get an answer as to why you have been lying so much in this game, distorting what has been said, and then ignoring people when they call you out on this. Furthermore, why would you offer to lynch yourself to prove that Boon and myself are scum when you could ACTUALLY CHECK US TONIGHT and get a real answer? If I actually get an answer, I'm not lynching you today. I'll give it a night. See what happens. <br>\n<br>\nOtherwise, this vote stays.<br>\n<br>\nAnd no, I will not be unvoting - I'll be switching it to someone that has been pinging me for quite a while, but I feel far more secure in this TL vote than I do in any other.<br>\n<br>\nTL, all I want is an explanation for your actions.", "time": "Wed May 03, 2017 2:42 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=71640&start=1700", "forum": "53", "thread": "71640"}

For now, treat my Null Scum section as if it were Null.<br>\nNote, that we had a huge split yesterDay, and then we had a town flip, so my reads have most likely drastically changed. I do this basically in random order, not necessarily town first. I also add to them if I see something else happening.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF00\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Flubbernugget</div></div> - Call it meta. Call it wagon analysis, but I do not think Flubber is scum at all. I have seen Flubber get mislynched way too often to not be weary of this. Hell, I've even mislynched him. His style is lynch bait to the max. He just got to L-1 way too easily, and the wagon's became so split that it's basically a guarantee scum were on both sides. I had to convince him to come back to Tywin when he voted Cooldog. I liked the interactions I had with him. I'm going to put him as a top town read of mine. I actually do think he's giving a good amount of analysis and what not, so this actually points Melanora a little scummier too, as she said Flub, myself, and rb were fighting for saying the most without saying anything, which I don't think is true.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF00\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">WhyMafia</div></div> - This is pretty standard WhyMafia play. I feel I've been getting to read him well, and it's no different here. He likes being on the unvote list, and he takes arguments from both sides. He stated he would have hammered Tywin when Tywin as L-1, and he even waited. I've seen WhyM hammer, and he was pressured into it before, and it went awry. I sense that he is even more cautious after that. I'm going to put him as a town read. Not going to doubt my ability to read him just yet. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#0040FF\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Kasumeat</div></div> - I generally did like Kasu on Tywin. His reads made sense as I saw everything that he was stating. I liked how we were talking about someone TvT'ing Tywin and I were scum. I liked his interactions to Backhand. he got ahead of himself with some stuff, and then he admitted he was wrong about it. I'm going to lean town for him. I really can't see him as scum right now.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#BF00FF\">CooLDoG</div></div> - Cooldog didn't do too much yesterDay. He was loud and kind of aimlessly pushed. I didn't like how he was so certain that I was scum, posting massive walls and getting quote happy, yet he changed off of me. He also defends Rb up the wazoo, even attacking Michael a little bit in the process. He had stated that Flubber could be scum, yet doesn't like it when Michael votes him. All this being said, he is pretty consistent with everything, and treats most people the same, as long as he doesn't scum read them. I don't like the unvoting then revoting onto flubber so close to lynch just because talking in twilight was brought up? What if Dier was active and locked immediately? You can't rely on Twilight existing at all, let alone long enough to get reads out. This being said, I don't know if I'm 100% sold on CD being scum. I actually don't see a lot of scum motivation coming from a lot of his posts. I definitely don't town read him, though. I kind of do like how he goes about dealing with I'm going Null Scum here. Actually, I just saw something I see as townier, and that is him calling a fair point on Tywin stating he'd give his own life to lynch two others the following days, and you just don't do that as town. Then he states that bad play isn't scummy nowadays, and THAT is a fair point nowadays...Null Town.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#BF00FF\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Gamma Emerald</div></div> - I could sit here and post multiple paragraphs regarding Gamma's plays, but honestly, they could both be scum or town from him. So I'll just focus on some key points. I just don't think he understood a lot of the cases going on for some reason. I feel if he was scum, he would have picked up on it more. This being said, he did switch to Tywin after being so confident, but I can see him just being done with the Day. We all were. I actually don't know if ScumGamma would have the audacity to wagon switch in this postion. I'm going to null town here.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF0080\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">rb</div></div> - See, I can go either way with him. He switched all over the place, and I could see him doing that as both alignments. I could tell he wanted the day to end, though. I've been pocketed from him before, so I can't really discern his town/scum game. I could go either way here, but it's not something I'm interested in pushing myself. Fuzzy scum reading this slot yesterday makes me okay to just put him in null scum.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF0080\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Michael Lee</div></div> - Michael was one of the people that made it really obvious he TvT'd Tywin and I, but now it's seeming that's not the case, as shown. Actually, I think he is hesitant to vote me, despite him stating the scum read on me. Him and I naturally are drawn to scum reading each other, due to playstyles, so I think we're both at least a little paranoid of that. I liked how he reevaluated his read on choof. Although I don't get what he didn't get about the Tywin case. Despite if you thought Tywin was scum or not, there is flat out no denying that he was contradicting himself or that there were actual cases on him. I did like the fuzzy could be scum comment, though. Him continuing to state Tywin as cop is a newbtown tell, although he'll learn fast. He is new to the site, and he'll catch on rather quick. I can't put this as one of my town reads, though, but I do think it could just be incredibly misguided town. I mean, he was right about Tywin, though. I didn't like that Kasu town read Tywin, but had no reasoning or justification for it. I'm going to put null scum. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF8000\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Melanora</div></div> - Oi. She posted how she was looking at everyone of my posts during my rants looking for a slip and couldn't find one. I really don't see scum motivation in that, but I guess she could have been trying to pocket me. She said that Kasu was pinging her for a comment he made, but wasn't going to scum read him for it. Hmm...the vote waiting was weird, and could be opportunistic. I do like her point on people saying tywin and i are TvT, then people started tearing each other apart. But scum is definitely on the Tywin wagon. At least one. And I think it would have to be outside of Rb/Gamma. I actually do think this is probably where it's at, but I generally liked the stuff she was posting. But a lot of it does actually look like scum trying to make it seem like she's doing something. I'm going to lean scum.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF0000\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">TheFuzzylogic99</div></div> - He has 12 posts. And they all grasp for straws. He also made a post where he stated the players he knows, and the players he doesn't. He stated backhand and mela as players he doesn't know, stating he's going to try to figure them out without mislynching them. Isn't that what you should do with everybody? He also posted that his scum play is bad and he will be caught in a few days because of a scum slip, I see as blatant trying to get an excuse to be town read. I also don't like his tunnel on Rb yesterday, and how he seemingly dropped that toDay. Scum slot.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF0000\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Backhand</div></div> - Okay, this guy is scum. One, he was totally on the Tywin wagon for a long time, posting out lies in his plays and everything, then he just decides to defend him. He also stated he wanted Flubber as his #1 lynch, and if not him, then Michael or Gamma. Come on...Michael and Gamma were two of the main people pushing Flubber and you decide you want to vote Flubber with them? I don't think so. Also, I really didn't like his posts during when Kasu and I were targeting him. I'm scum reading this slot. Also, he posts a lot of questions without even really giving analysis. I see this as scum trying to act like they are doing something by having the other people do the talking.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">()_+_) ()_-_) ()_+_) ()_-_) ()_+_) ()_-_) ()_+_) ()_-_) ()_+_) ()_-_) ()_+_) ()_-_) ()_+_) ()_-_) ()_+_) ()_-_) ()_+_) ()_-_) ()_+_) ()_-_) ()_+_) ()_-_) ()_+_) ()_-_)<br>\n<br>\nWill Fuzzy ever become active?<br>\n<br>\nWill Backhand be able to explain his scum reads that were voting for his scum read???<br>\n<br>\nWill people ever realize that cop and role cop are in no way, shape, or form similar or the same role?!?!!?!?!?!?!?!?<br>\n<br>\nFind out next time on....<div style=\"display:inline;color:#800080\"><div style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">LAST NIGHT TOMORROW!!!!!!!<br>\n</div></div><br>\nMy name is Boonskiies...and I'll see you next time.</div><br>\n<br>\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Do you ever get that wedgie where you just can't seem to fix it?

Scum hard pushes a town cop lynch through while ignoring all evidence given, then next day goes \"scum had perfection information so if you knew he was town you're scum\". Wrong. The information was known to all. He was a role cop. I provided superior ways to deal with him. I suggested leaving him alive so scum could waste roleblock/nightkills. There were plenty of good lynch targets (you flubber and boon). All evidence was ignored. All solutions were ignored. The inferior line of play was chosen since scum decided to hard push the lynch through. Hope it was worth it. I'm calling you out for it. I don't buy Boon \"scum is split between vote and not\". Scum is on the vote, and manhandled the push through to convince the townies. There's no doubt about it.

For now, treat my Null Scum section as if it were Null.<br>\nNote, that we had a huge split yesterDay, and then we had a town flip, so my reads have most likely drastically changed. I do this basically in random order, not necessarily town first. I also add to them if I see something else happening.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF00\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Flubbernugget</div></div> - Call it meta. Call it wagon analysis, but I do not think Flubber is scum at all. I have seen Flubber get mislynched way too often to not be weary of this. Hell, I've even mislynched him. His style is lynch bait to the max. He just got to L-1 way too easily, and the wagon's became so split that it's basically a guarantee scum were on both sides. I had to convince him to come back to Tywin when he voted Cooldog. I liked the interactions I had with him. I'm going to put him as a top town read of mine. I actually do think he's giving a good amount of analysis and what not, so this actually points Melanora a little scummier too, as she said Flub, myself, and rb were fighting for saying the most without saying anything, which I don't think is true.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF00\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">WhyMafia</div></div> - This is pretty standard WhyMafia play. I feel I've been getting to read him well, and it's no different here. He likes being on the unvote list, and he takes arguments from both sides. He stated he would have hammered Tywin when Tywin as L-1, and he even waited. I've seen WhyM hammer, and he was pressured into it before, and it went awry. I sense that he is even more cautious after that. I'm going to put him as a town read. Not going to doubt my ability to read him just yet. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#0040FF\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Kasumeat</div></div> - I generally did like Kasu on Tywin. His reads made sense as I saw everything that he was stating. I liked how we were talking about someone TvT'ing Tywin and I were scum. I liked his interactions to Backhand. he got ahead of himself with some stuff, and then he admitted he was wrong about it. I'm going to lean town for him. I really can't see him as scum right now.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#BF00FF\">CooLDoG</div></div> - Cooldog didn't do too much yesterDay. He was loud and kind of aimlessly pushed. I didn't like how he was so certain that I was scum, posting massive walls and getting quote happy, yet he changed off of me. He also defends Rb up the wazoo, even attacking Michael a little bit in the process. He had stated that Flubber could be scum, yet doesn't like it when Michael votes him. All this being said, he is pretty consistent with everything, and treats most people the same, as long as he doesn't scum read them. I don't like the unvoting then revoting onto flubber so close to lynch just because talking in twilight was brought up? What if Dier was active and locked immediately? You can't rely on Twilight existing at all, let alone long enough to get reads out. This being said, I don't know if I'm 100% sold on CD being scum. I actually don't see a lot of scum motivation coming from a lot of his posts. I definitely don't town read him, though. I kind of do like how he goes about dealing with I'm going Null Scum here. Actually, I just saw something I see as townier, and that is him calling a fair point on Tywin stating he'd give his own life to lynch two others the following days, and you just don't do that as town. Then he states that bad play isn't scummy nowadays, and THAT is a fair point nowadays...Null Town.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#BF00FF\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Gamma Emerald</div></div> - I could sit here and post multiple paragraphs regarding Gamma's plays, but honestly, they could both be scum or town from him. So I'll just focus on some key points. I just don't think he understood a lot of the cases going on for some reason. I feel if he was scum, he would have picked up on it more. This being said, he did switch to Tywin after being so confident, but I can see him just being done with the Day. We all were. I actually don't know if ScumGamma would have the audacity to wagon switch in this postion. I'm going to null town here.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF0080\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">rb</div></div> - See, I can go either way with him. He switched all over the place, and I could see him doing that as both alignments. I could tell he wanted the day to end, though. I've been pocketed from him before, so I can't really discern his town/scum game. I could go either way here, but it's not something I'm interested in pushing myself. Fuzzy scum reading this slot yesterday makes me okay to just put him in null scum.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF0080\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Michael Lee</div></div> - Michael was one of the people that made it really obvious he TvT'd Tywin and I, but now it's seeming that's not the case, as shown. Actually, I think he is hesitant to vote me, despite him stating the scum read on me. Him and I naturally are drawn to scum reading each other, due to playstyles, so I think we're both at least a little paranoid of that. I liked how he reevaluated his read on choof. Although I don't get what he didn't get about the Tywin case. Despite if you thought Tywin was scum or not, there is flat out no denying that he was contradicting himself or that there were actual cases on him. I did like the fuzzy could be scum comment, though. Him continuing to state Tywin as cop is a newbtown tell, although he'll learn fast. He is new to the site, and he'll catch on rather quick. I can't put this as one of my town reads, though, but I do think it could just be incredibly misguided town. I mean, he was right about Tywin, though. I didn't like that Kasu town read Tywin, but had no reasoning or justification for it. I'm going to put null scum. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF8000\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Melanora</div></div> - Oi. She posted how she was looking at everyone of my posts during my rants looking for a slip and couldn't find one. I really don't see scum motivation in that, but I guess she could have been trying to pocket me. She said that Kasu was pinging her for a comment he made, but wasn't going to scum read him for it. Hmm...the vote waiting was weird, and could be opportunistic. I do like her point on people saying tywin and i are TvT, then people started tearing each other apart. But scum is definitely on the Tywin wagon. At least one. And I think it would have to be outside of Rb/Gamma. I actually do think this is probably where it's at, but I generally liked the stuff she was posting. But a lot of it does actually look like scum trying to make it seem like she's doing something. I'm going to lean scum.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF0000\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">TheFuzzylogic99</div></div> - He has 12 posts. And they all grasp for straws. He also made a post where he stated the players he knows, and the players he doesn't. He stated backhand and mela as players he doesn't know, stating he's going to try to figure them out without mislynching them. Isn't that what you should do with everybody? He also posted that his scum play is bad and he will be caught in a few days because of a scum slip, I see as blatant trying to get an excuse to be town read. I also don't like his tunnel on Rb yesterday, and how he seemingly dropped that toDay. Scum slot.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF0000\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Backhand</div></div> - Okay, this guy is scum. One, he was totally on the Tywin wagon for a long time, posting out lies in his plays and everything, then he just decides to defend him. He also stated he wanted Flubber as his #1 lynch, and if not him, then Michael or Gamma. Come on...Michael and Gamma were two of the main people pushing Flubber and you decide you want to vote Flubber with them? I don't think so. Also, I really didn't like his posts during when Kasu and I were targeting him. I'm scum reading this slot. Also, he posts a lot of questions without even really giving analysis. I see this as scum trying to act like they are doing something by having the other people do the talking.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">()_+_) ()_-_) ()_+_) ()_-_) ()_+_) ()_-_) ()_+_) ()_-_) ()_+_) ()_-_) ()_+_) ()_-_) ()_+_) ()_-_) ()_+_) ()_-_) ()_+_) ()_-_) ()_+_) ()_-_) ()_+_) ()_-_) ()_+_) ()_-_)<br>\n<br>\nWill Fuzzy ever become active?<br>\n<br>\nWill Backhand be able to explain his scum reads that were voting for his scum read???<br>\n<br>\nWill people ever realize that cop and role cop are in no way, shape, or form similar or the same role?!?!!?!?!?!?!?!?<br>\n<br>\nFind out next time on....<div style=\"display:inline;color:#800080\"><div style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">LAST NIGHT TOMORROW!!!!!!!<br>\n</div></div><br>\nMy name is Boonskiies...and I'll see you next time.</div><br>\n<br>\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Do you ever get that wedgie where you just can't seem to fix it?

I don't mean 'scum motive' that people say a lot, because all scum motivation is to not get lynched and lynch town, while all town motive is to lynch scum over town and if a PR, not get themselves lynched.  That's it.  What I mean is that you're smart enough and good enough to know how to manipulate the game with the common scum tactics I already mentioned, and you've been using them to a T.

This was Gamma's plan all along. Gamma has played with Tywin before and knows that he's fucking awful as town and planned to use his as his pawn to mislynch everyone who pushed Tywin.

If Boon had said that he messed up pushing Tywin that that would be a different story. I probably would <br>\nhave enough doubts not to push him.  He keeps pushing the narrative that lynching the Role Cop was a good move. Yes the Rolecop is not a cop...but it still a PR and instead of making scum NK him we gave them a free kill and than allow them to kill another more useful PR, We all make mistake and play badly as town sometimes. Heck I lynched a conftown during Lylo in one of my early game. I am no stranger of making mistakes. Really dumb ones. Its just that it seems he trying to double down on Tywin being a role cop was not important, as if he is scum trying to justify his action. His emotional reaction ealier in the day seem fake and a way to manipulate others, The only reason I have not voted Boon is that  I have enough concern that Flub has some how fooled me into thinking he might somehow be town and the Boon wagon is actually a counter wagon to Flub.

If Boon had said that he messed up pushing Tywin that that would be a different story. I probably would <br>\nhave enough doubts not to push him.  He keeps pushing the narrative that lynching the Role Cop was a good move. Yes the Rolecop is not a cop...but it still a PR and instead of making scum NK him we gave them a free kill and than allow them to kill another more useful PR, We all make mistake and play badly as town sometimes. Heck I lynched a conftown during Lylo in one of my early game. I am no stranger of making mistakes. Really dumb ones. Its just that it seems he trying to double down on Tywin being a role cop was not important, as if he is scum trying to justify his action. His emotional reaction ealier in the day seem fake and a way to manipulate others, The only reason I have not voted Boon is that  I have enough concern that Flub has some how fooled me into thinking he might somehow be town and the Boon wagon is actually a counter wagon to Flub. Right now Flub is null ..I am having a hard time reading him this game .</div></blockquote>\n\nAll this being said, why, as scum, would I be pushing the idea of me making a bad move away? That's the easy way out, and as scum, would put far less pressure. This actually goes further to prove I'm town. There is absolutely no reason as scum that I would be defending how I played yesterDay. At all. It just brings more focus towards me in a bad way.

I think the town has very good reasons to suspect me, and if I were in your shoes I would probably be high on my list.  That said, I can be pretty sure that two of you know that I am town and Cooldog/notmafia are scum.* So when I see someone who has basically been floating through the game suddenly get real happy to go after me... Yeah.  And eventually the town will know I was being honest, so I'm really just projecting my thoughts to that future. <br>\n<br>\nMel, to answer your question, I was nursing a theory that we were dealing with two scum groups of two, just because I was having such trouble finding partners for flubber.  In that scenario, you or your group would have targeted choof night 1 (having no way to communicate with the other group), which would explain one night kill N1 and two kills N2.  I wanted to put you on the record, if you were lying you couldn't be sure me or someone else was a tracker, you'd have to make a choice. But I'm quite a bit more comfortable now you've claimed JOAT, if there are two deaths tomorrow your claim becomes extremely suspicious, and either way a killing group wants you dead. <br>\n<br>\n*or its whymafia and rb or whatever and we've already lost", "time": "Tue May 23, 2017 7:27 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=71640&start=3100", "forum": "53", "thread": "71640"}
