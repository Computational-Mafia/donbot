Nobody wants to be a loser.<br>\n 2] Do not take screenshots or directly quote any of the PMs that I send you. Doing so will result in a mod-kill. Pretending to break this rule is the same as actually breaking it. You may paraphrase, but use caution. When in doubt, run it by me first.<br>\n 3] Do not edit any of your posts, if you have the ability to do so.<br>\n 4] Do not use encrypted text, hidden text, small text, or any other hard-to-read text when posting.<br>\n 5] Once you have been lynched or killed, you are out of the game. Do not post anymore until the game is over. That means no \"Bah!\" posts, please.<br>\n 6] Do not talk about this game with anybody else outside of this thread unless your role PM explicitly says that you can.<br>\n 7] Heated discussion is fine, but personal attacks, insults, flaming, and poor sportsmanship are not. Please don't be a jerk to your fellow players. If I feel that your behavior is preventing other players from enjoying the game, I reserve the right to force-replace or mod-kill you.<br>\n 8] Do not talk about ongoing games. Like really, come on...<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#800080\">Day, Night, and Twilight:</div></div><br>\n 9] Each Day phase will last for two weeks apiece and each Night phase will last for two days. I will post specific deadlines in the game thread at the start of every Day and Night phase.<br>\n10] Players may continue to talk during Twilight, including the player that has been lynched.<br>\n11] If you do not send me your Night action before the specified deadline, I will assume that you are not performing an action on that Night. <br>\n12] If you know you will be unavailable during a Night phase, you may send me your night action during the preceding Day phase if you so desire.<br>\n13] Deadline extension requests will be considered on a case-by-case basis.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#800080\">Voting:</div></div><br>\n14] Please post all votes and unvotes using either the bold tag or the vote tag. Nicknames are fine, as long as I can understand them. Votes should look like this: <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote:Boonskiies</div> or <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Boon</span><br>\n15] Unvotes are helpful, but not necessary.<br>\n16] Please refrain from engaging in any kind of voting trickery. If it looks like a vote, I'm counting it as a vote.<br>\n17] A lynch will only occur when a majority (more than 50% of all possible votes) is reached. The number of votes needed to hammer will be included with every vote count.<br>\n18] If a majority is not reached by the deadline, there will be no lynch on that Day.<br>\n19] Once a hammer occurs, no votes or unvotes will prevent the lynch from happening.<br>\n20] Additional votes include VOTE: No Lynch to end the Day with no lynch (which will also require a majority) and VOTE: Draw to end the game in a draw (which will require 100% agreement from all living players).<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#800080\">Activity:</div></div><br>\n21] You will be expected to post at least once every 48 hours. If you go more than 48 hours without posting, you will be prodded.<br>\n22] If you receive a prod, you will have 24 hours to post in the game thread. If you do not respond to your prod within 24 hours, you will be replaced. Additionally, if I have to prod you more than three times, you will be replaced.<br>\n23] If you know that you will have limited access to the game for more than a few days, please let me know either in the thread or via PM.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#800080\">Communication with the Moderator:</div></div><br>\n24] I may be pretty close to perfect, but I do still make mistakes every now and then. If you notice an error with the vote counts, deadlines, or anything else related to the game, please let me know and I will correct the issue.<br>\n25] I will not answer any role-related questions in the game thread. If you have any questions about your role, the (theoretical) roles of any other players in the game, or (theoretical) role interactions, send me a PM. Do not try to trick me into confirming a player's role. I will not be amused.<br>\n26] If you need to get my attention, just include @Mod or @Boon in your post. Also, bolding will help catch my eye.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#800080\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Miscellaneous:</div></div><br>\n27] If you have any problems with another player, send me a PM and I will do my best to resolve the issue.<br>\n28] If a player is mod-killed during the Day phase, then that Day will end immediately.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#800080\">29] My color is Purple (#800080) DON&#8217;T USE IT.</div></div><br>\n30] The flavor text is for entertainment purposes only. Analyze it at your own risk.<br>\n31] Do not ask me to mod-kill, force-replace, or discipline any other player in the game. That is my decision to make, not yours.<br>\n32] As the moderator, my word is final. Please respect my instructions and my decisions.<br>\n33] I reserve the right to change these rules during the game if necessary.

Backpedaling would be to say something and then say 'nevermind, I didn't really mean that' or 'I take that back'. Maybe someone will care to give a more elegant definition. Anyway&#8230;many players act like as soon as you vote for someone, you 100% believe that they are scum. That should actually very rarely be the case. As town, we know nothing and should suspect everyone especially in DAY 1 with no info. In the above comment I implied that Flubber could be town after all. Maybe I hadn't explicitly stated that possibility earlier, but that should be a given at all times. I probably ultimately cast my vote because I was annoyed at him. Looking back we were both being jerks so I am more calmed down now, especially since further posts have proven him a bit more useful and a bit less annoying.  <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\">  Am I backpedaling or just evolving?<br>\n<br>\nFurther in post #109 with all the quoting. I admit that my posts #54 and #55 might look a bit odd next to each other.  There was some timing involved. I read that Flubber comment #47 much earlier but only got around to replying after Demerine initiated post RVS talk. Since I found Flubber's response annoying and I was going to call it a night for myself, I decided to place my post RVS vote on him right away .<br>\n<br>\nAnd then this nice little annotation&#8230;partially explained above. <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6581919#p6581919\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6581919#p6581919\" data-post-id=\"6581919\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 109</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=24164\">Aneninen</a> wrote:</cite><br>\n<br>\nAnd then the post you asked about:<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6581280#p6581280\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6581280#p6581280\" data-post-id=\"6581280\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 90</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=25275\">unsub</a> wrote:</cite>Forgot, maybe.

Assuming a long term strategy on early-Day1 is WTF. He didn't cite other games. Massive did that because I asked him to do so. And even if I (or some of us) think that this early gameplay might come from a town-Flubber, it's clear that this read in itself won't be enough later. <br>\nThe last part is a bit paradox. If he's town he helps the scum fly under the radar. So, if he's scum, shouldn't he fly under the radar instead of getting focused by many players? <br>\n<br>\nOkay, \"backpedalling\" might not have been the best word for that. But I think I've managed to make it clear why I find his posts strange. It seems that he's trying to make up something out of nothing.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\n\t1. I did not backpedal. (which you kinda concede there at the end)<br>\n\t2. Flubber did cite other games. First time in post #38, second time #88 although I admit that one was prompted by another player. (You gotta understand that I am reading things on my phone and won't remember exact details but I knew it happened, I didn't just come up with it out of thin air.)<br>\n\t3. Given that people often like to reference other games and set themselves up to look town or give false impressions, I don't think it's far-fetched to say that a player is setting themselves up for a longer term strategy. It is easy to be random and annoying early in the game, and if he were to do that every game he could cite those games in his favor. You may say my thinking is paranoid or that I am a noob for thinking this way but as an economist I like to think macro as well as micro. <br>\n\t4. About the paradox - It's not really about what he should be doing if he is scum/town, it's about how he is being perceived regardless of his underlying intentions.  If he is scum, his play makes him obvious and if he is town, he is not helping town by being scummy, is he? Thus a liability either way. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\nBRB while I go write a whole book.", "time": "Thu Feb 05, 2015 4:03 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=60635&start=125", "forum": "53", "thread": "60635"}

They had been waiting until vehement town-vs-town fights started to emerge. But I've seen very town-looking scums too (ehm, Farside, have you ever seen something similar? ^_^), just as well aggressive posters, even 1-vs-1 fighters. <br>\nSo, statistically, it's very likely that at least one scum is flying under the radar but I'd doubt that all of them are doing this now. <br>\n<br>\nAs for \"over-explaining\". That's an impression. You know, I read my very first scumgame again not so long ago and I realized that I was \"over-explaining\" everything all the time. (Massive was there anyway. You can ask him too.) What do I mean by that? As a townie I'm much more careless, sometimes I mix up things, forget to answer questions, ignore less significant looking players etc. As a scum I \"cross the T-s and dot the I-s\" so as to look \"very town\". Eg. I try not to leave any \"holes\" in my posts. I'm not a very experienced player either. (As for online Mafia. in RL Mafia I have more than 20 years of experience.)<br>\nYour posts gave me a similar impression. But since you're a newer player with no meta, I think this is a mere \"style-tell\", not a scumtell.

They had been waiting until vehement town-vs-town fights started to emerge. But I've seen very town-looking scums too (ehm, Farside, have you ever seen something similar? ^_^), just as well aggressive posters, even 1-vs-1 fighters. <br>\nSo, statistically, it's very likely that at least one scum is flying under the radar but I'd doubt that all of them are doing this now. <br>\n<br>\nAs for \"over-explaining\". That's an impression. You know, I read my very first scumgame again not so long ago and I realized that I was \"over-explaining\" everything all the time. (Massive was there anyway. You can ask him too.) What do I mean by that? As a townie I'm much more careless, sometimes I mix up things, forget to answer questions, ignore less significant looking players etc. As a scum I \"cross the T-s and dot the I-s\" so as to look \"very town\". Eg. I try not to leave any \"holes\" in my posts. I'm not a very experienced player either. (As for online Mafia. in RL Mafia I have more than 20 years of experience.)<br>\nYour posts gave me a similar impression. But since you're a newer player with no meta, I think this is a mere \"style-tell\", not a scumtell.

As a townie I'm much more careless, sometimes I mix up things, forget to answer questions, ignore less significant looking players etc. As a scum I \"cross the T-s and dot the I-s\" so as to look \"very town\". Eg. I try not to leave any \"holes\" in my posts. I'm not a very experienced player either. (As for online Mafia. in RL Mafia I have more than 20 years of experience.)<br>\nYour posts gave me a similar impression. But since you're a newer player with no meta, I think this is a mere \"style-tell\", not a scumtell. (FYI I know players who has quite a similar townplay.)</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nWho me?!

On the other hand, I think that he turned his RVS on Unsub to a real vote without giving no real reasons. (Still <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6582976#p6582976\">137</a>.) His later walls are mostly about Unsub and it seems that he's scumreading her using the Regardless Of Card. He's interacting with very few players and doesn't give reads on anyone apart from Unsub and RadiantCowbells. It's easy to imagine that these posts are coming from a scum who's trying to get as few \"enemies\" as he can get.<br>\n<br>\nAs I've already mentioned: I think it's silly to vote for a slot whose player might be replaced soon. If needed, I'll give a more detailed explanation for that.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nSo the reason why I didn't give any real reasons (and a part of the reasoning for my latency in posts here on MS) is because things have been hectic, pretty much on and off in my life for responses. However, those \"later walls\" you mentioned were meant to support my reasoning in 137. It's also the reason I've been interacting with very few players. I think I'm gonna (with this little bit of good free time I have in these next few days) look at the other players here and try to ask some substantial questions where I see fit.<br>\n<br>\nAnother part of this is that I'm pretty new, and so asking valuable questions and making substantial interactions (for now) is kinda tough for me. I'll get there, please just give me some time.

I know that I, when I'm really angry with someone, type excessively fast and make a lot of small errors.<br>\n<br>\n2) On and off caps-ing and combining \"?\" and \"!\" a lot tell me that Aenin was trying to make a deliberate point of anger and frustration. Very much indicative of asserting frustration to make a point.<br>\n<br>\n3) Mindfulness. Aenin was mindful of swearing, often censoring the f-cks and f-ckings. This shows that, while very angry and roweled up, Aenin was still in control of the frustration. <br>\n<br>\nI don't think a scumbag who got in a corner and lashed out would be both frustrated yet in control and trying to make a point of it. If Aenin was slipping, it would be a hard slip where the posts just turn into \"<span style=\"text-transform:uppercase;font-size:smaller\">I HATE YOU OMGUS I'M NOT SCUM I'LL END YOU GET WREKT M8!</span>\"<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6597583#p6597583\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6597583#p6597583\" data-post-id=\"6597583\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 329</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=24184\">Boonskiies</a> wrote:</cite><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#800080\">ozgin and Titus are being prodded. </div></div></div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nSorry!

Please make very careful note that I did not say that I felt like RC was scum, that's different.

But if we check the activity page, we can see that Unsub, Flubber and Titus are in the prod zone. Also, the Pramitz slot is empty and there's no replacement.

It might bad play but it is not necessarily scummy for him. I don't think Massive is scum for his read on Anen, I simply think he is mistaken. I don't really know what else to say.

For instance, I tend not to put myself on my own t/s list whatever I roll. If Kling is in the habit then fine. If she then made one list with her name and one without then so what? I don't believe that is a scumtell, a scumslip or whatever people are implying it is. As for the lack of scumreads, why would scum do that? They want mislynches Day 1.

Still don't understand how 150 works ... starts off saying RC and Pramitz are scum together, quotes an RC post that Aneninen agrees with almost completely, but still calls it \"overdriven\" and votes RC over Pramitz. This is completely reliant on his correctly reading \"scum-scum interaction\" and completely ignoring the seven scummy things he listed about Pramitz. <br>\n<br>\nSoft-defends unsub in 151. Harder-defends unsub in 154 (trying to push unsub's gameplay onto a \"playstyle\" and hush him, rather than trying to get him to overexplain more). 171 tries to deflect RC who points out exactly what I pointed out above, AND calls it tunnelling (when 150 really is scummy). 172 buddies Farside. 172 pushes himself and unsub as town. <br>\n<br>\n178 claims to be doing more work than the average player, and asks to ISO him, and since I am right now, I can tell you his work has mostly been coaching unsub and the pretty bad 150. <br>\n<br>\n234 soft-defends unsub. 234 claims to have posted \"a lot\" about RC (in actuality 3 posts), claims to have posted about how bad self-voting is (never did), claims he posted about RC's style being a red herring to cover up scumminess (he never did) -- he's hopping on a lot of other people's posts. 255 abandons RC? 255 also outright states RC is a \"bad townie\" -- need to check if RC has claimed by this point or not. (JUST had, in 246.) 260 \"too much effort\" on RC (again, now 4 or 5 posts) and that effort appears to be \"pushing other people's cases\" and \"quickly believing her roleclaim.\" <br>\n<br>\nI still think that \"I'll re-examine everyone\" at the end of 260 comes off like an easy scum \"I'll be back to do more work\" throwaway comment, and without me calling him on it, 265 and 268 probably don't happen. 265 top townread is (unsurprisingly) unsub, top scum are Klingoncelt, Titus, Pramitz, but doesn't vote any of them. Comes back to 150 in 278 and STILL doesn't vote Pramitz, despite reiterating that RC's points on him could be true. Pramitz is his top scumread at this point. <br>\n<br>\n282 soft-defends unsub. 282 confirms Pramitz as top scumread, still no vote. 291 is AtE and demands I read his town-meta, and I still maintain I hate relying on meta either way, I think it's lazy. 296 is happy that I am going away but still takes that opportunity to start turning the tables into a scumread on me. Evidently I've already harped on the \"not voting Pramitz\" thing because he defends (?) not voting, and tries to push it as avoiding giving me fuel to tunnel him on. 300 tries to pass off his scummy behavior as me tunnelling. <br>\n<br>\n301, after demanding people read his meta, is sad when that doesn't exactly turn up the results he wants. 304 dismisses my reads as associative when they aren't. 304 dismisses his scummy answers as me tunnelling, not as him actually being scummy, which I guess you have to expect. 304 again blanket-believes RC's roleclaim without real reason (calling her the \"highest branch\" in his low-hanging fruit analogy). Still don't see him as low-hanging fruit there. <br>\n<br>\n304 tries to call my meta into the argument. 304 claims saying \"forthcoming answers\" was to see if I was misreading him or was scum; at 265 I had just started scumreading him so this is OMGUS-in-waiting? <br>\n<br>\n306 asks people to re-read and assume he's town. I never understood this. He's not asking people to be impartial or to re-read from both sides, just from the side where he's town. <br>\n<br>\n313 claims I cherrypick questions to answer, and yeah, I do. It's because I'm more interested in playing my own game, rather than helping someone else play theirs. You want to learn more about someone? Ask your own questions, don't wait for others to do so. I generally only comment on things that I want more information about.<br>\n<br>\n(Plus, if I'm scumreading someone, why WOULD I answer their questions?)<br>\n<br>\n313 tries to brush off the meta-read again. 352 tries to play me trapping VDA as me coaching VDA. I think anyone who reads that can see I think VDA's vote is junk and am trying to get him to confess that his vote is junk, and not that I'm coaching him. If anyone's tunnelling at this point, it's Aneninen. <br>\n<br>\n356 attacks me by claiming he's not doing something because I'd scumread him for it. 383 continues the \"massive coaching VDA\" angle. Since VDA is now confirmed town, this obviously won't come back up, but his case on VDA and I being scum together in this post takes some IMMENSE jumps in logic. Anyone want to go back and look at this and tell me it's town-based?<br>\n<br>\n427 farside asks why his read on Klingoncelt changed; he answers that it had changed, and why he was town-reading her early on, but not why he's scum-reading her now. Uses 427 to get a dig in on me when I'm not part of the discussion even. <br>\n<br>\n563 praises Titus VCA while pointing out a flaw in it (farside stopping the VDA wagon, which I didn't even consider), but still is OK with it since it claims Pisskop and I are scummy because of it. Pramitz has disappeared as a scumread at this point. (Oh because Pramitz became Ellie, who died overnight.) 563 also has to change the massive / VDA interaction read since VDA is confirmed town. <br>\n<br>\n567 is the start of the \"let's lynch massive because he wanted the vig to shoot RC\" angle of attack. 567 claims \"these are all the posts you made about RC\" which I later refute and Aneninen has to go back and call it \"posts about your READ on RC\" (and even one of these doesn't even mention RC at all). (Oh I see, I don't include her in the list of possible lynches I'd approve of, which doesn't have 2/3ds of the town in it either.)<br>\n<br>\n583 defends RC but demands her results. In bold no less. We already know she didn't jailkeep either of the dead people or either of the killers, so how is this information beneficial? This reads more like \"admit you jailkeep'ed me so I can point this out.\"<br>\n<br>\n603 is the change from \"posts about RC\" to my \"read\" on RC. 666 still pushing my \"read\" on RC. 685 ... I was waiting for someone, anyone to go \"clearly he's being cheeky when he's suggesting VDA vig RC.\"  I did not expect it to be pushed as serious for 100-plus posts. 685 soft-defends unsub. 732 tunnelling for me, while dismissing his saying I \"might not\" be town as ESL and not him saying his professed \"absolute scum\" read isn't as absolute as he'd like you to believe.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nDEMERINE / TITUS<br>\n<br>\nLike 96. I've said I like 149 as well. Not sure Demerine would have ultimately been easier to read than Titus, but I liked where this was going. Titus enters at 280 and between 280 and 422 (six posts, 1-6 ISO) says ... absolutely nothing. Votes Klingoncelt for no reason, wants an unsub flip for no reason. Between 488 and 540 (ISO 7-17) pushes any lynch at all without mentioning any of the targets as scummy, relying solely on bandwagon pressure. Would think that this would play into the upcoming VCA, maybe? That TItus would discount the trains she was aggressively pushing? 540 says lynch pisskop tomorrow, mentions pisskop in the VCA, but doesn't ever go back to pisskop D2. <br>\n<br>\n556 is the VCA. I just noticed something very interesting. How is it that neither Demerine nor Titus was on ANY of those trains showcased in the VCA? Even the one train Demerine is on, farside's, is the one Titus decides is on scum. I know there was some argument about how Titus wanted to be the lynch vote on at least one of the trains at the end of D1 (and various people were blocking it), but never voted on any of those wagons. Interesting. (Should probably be noted that Demerine was the active player for RC one and asked good questions about it, and was probably already absent by the Aneninen one.) <br>\n<br>\n593 parrots Aneninen. Does she? Who's parrotting whom here? Aneninen's first post on this subject appears to be 563, so Titus is just parrotting it. 596 claims I \"haven't made any effort\" to get Aneninen lynched, but it's possible that all the action D1 happened after Demerine left but before Titus appeared, and we know Titus didn't read the thread before appearing (see 280). Also then likely that Titus didn't read the RC \"vig suggestion\" in context, but then why parrot it? Possibly OMGUS I guess? 598 claims I care about easy mislynches -- which are those exactly? 613 refers to \"grandma\" but no idea who that is. I assume farside. <br>\n<br>\n636 DESPITE claiming to believe that I actually am suggesting legitimately that the vig shoot RC, makes reference to an off-site variant that (I assume) lets Titus have more aggressive control over RC's presence in the game. <br>\n<br>\n647 evidently Grandma is Klingoncelt? Sorry farside! 662 claims \"yesterday's lynch felt off\" but makes no mention of her aggressive pushes in regards to it. <br>\n<br>\n669 claims to have switched to me due to a \"good case being presented.\" vote switch is 568 and the \"good case\" is (likely) 563 and 567, because it's probably safe to assume that Titus didn't go back and read yesterday (and has actually said \"today is a new day, yesterday doesn't matter\") -- Is 563 a good case? Misunderstanding my interaction with VDA, now misunderstood a second time due to VDA's flip, and the RC \"vig\" comment. Is 567 a good case? Half the quotes from me about RC and more serious analysis of a flippant comment. Neither are good, but would Titus THINK they are good? Better than her own case on farside? At the time of her switch, it looked opportune, which is why I wanted to vote for her, and claiming it was a \"good case\" that caused her switch just doesn't add up.<br>\n<br>\nELLIE / PRAMITZ<br>\n<br>\nPramitz's vote is obviously RVS and there's no reason to see it seriously. Pramitz has seven posts, how does Pramitz get to be Aneninen's top scum read? How does he get to be voted by RC? Neither of those make sense, and I'm looking at RC's vote post since Pramitz quoted it whole. <br>\n<br>\nEllie joins at 399 and proclaims herself town, which makes me itch. (Other people noted this as well.) Ellie makes a good point in 407 on TT's jump from Aneninen to Ellie, so need to go back and look at that when I get to TT's ISO. Ellie is the first to bring up the RC \"vig\" comment in 523 and my also-cheeky response is 525. (Just for the people who want to say I changed my story somewhere today.)</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\nIt actually was good that Aneninen was first alphabetically and Demerine / Titus was second because seeing them in close proximity to one another made one thing pretty clear to me, and that's that it's unlikely that they're scum together. Either Aneninen is scum and Titus is dopily parroting him, or Aneninen has built a horrible case as town and Titus is riding along to see how long she can push it. If they were scum together, they'd be more likely to push different angles, and you would think that Titus wouldn't just immediately jump on board with her partner, so easily praising his case. The fact that they're both currently in \"bullying people for votes\" mode makes it tough to determine which is which, though.<br>\n<br>\nIt was also interesting to see Aneninen's overselling of his hard work for the town. His requests that other players re-read parts with the assumption he's town. <br>\n<br>\nEllie is the first to bring up the RC \"vig\" comment in 523 and my also-cheeky response is 525. (Just for the people who want to say I changed my story somewhere today.)<br>\n<br>\nFarside had 90 posts and I couldn't face it without lunch. Now I'm back to it.

Was this before the claim? (not until 246) 213 says 180 is scum-Ozgin; the only reason I can see flat-out calling Ozgin scum due to 180 is because he's attack (guess!) unsub, who farside has already been soft-defending. 215 soft-defending unsub. 221 presents a \"case\" on Ozgin, which amounts to \"see how he only interacts with unsub! that's scummy!\" and we know now Ozgin is town. <br>\n<br>\nGood question asking 259 (ISO 35) through 272 (ISO 39). 302 asks Anen about me and in 314 agrees it's tunneling, so it'll be interesting to see how that progresses D2. <br>\n<br>\n392 says she won't vote Anen, and to read what she wrote and what TT wrote.

Conclusions are logical.<br>\n<br>\n403 moves to Ellie for \"Hi, I'm town.\" Who was he voting for prior to this? Hrm, evidently Aneninen (298) and gave a fine reason, a better reason than his jump onto Ellie.<br>\n<br>\n428 hey look I already said most of this! and gives a good answer to being called on his \"test vote\" on Ellie.<br>\n<br>\n468 is fine, VDA's gameplay under pressure was not great and the continued pressure came from many places.<br>\n<br>\n576 is bad but just oblivious, not malicious.<br>\n<br>\n578 is absolutely correct.

It is right after RC's role claim though (246) so possibly a logical abandonment of the RC suspicions. The Ozgin vote is still kinda weak.<br>\n<br>\n307 soft-defends Aneninen. I'm still not sure how Aneninen could POSSIBLY be perceived as an \"easy lynch\" or \"low hanging fruit\" at this point, so maybe someone should explain that to me. 307 also notes that he believe town-Titus would be more active upon entry and not just positioning to lynch, which is a very good point.<br>\n<br>\n346 gets in on the VDA weird confusion.<br>\n<br>\nI've already mentioned how 599 reads like fake scum sympathy. In the grand scheme of things, though, Offers to be replaced in the same post, which I don't think scum would do.<br>\n<br>\nI don't find much about unsub scummy, which makes the soft-defending from Aneninen and farside even stranger. <br>\n<br>\nPISSKOP<br>\n<br>\nEarly RVS stuff is fine, and is asking questions, which is good. 159 is the \"CBA\" post and I never get why players, either alignment, feel the need to post \"nobody's being obviously scummy\" posts. <br>\n<br>\n181 is the RC defense. I like the context of the defense (since it's contained with other events and questions). The entirety of the interaction between pisskop and RC is an attempt to get them back in the game, culminating in 243 -- so either they are scum together and pisskop is recklessly trying to salvage RC, or pisskop is the only one dealing with RC in a sensible manner. NOTE that 243 is prior to the roleclaim, though. <br>\n<br>\nAfter RC has been saved, pisskop goes into fluff mode. ISO 13-22 or so before coming onto the Ozgin wagon. Really like 424 which shows that despite being fluffy in bits, pisskop is still paying attention to the game. <br>\n<br>\nI have no idea why Titus was so determined to be the lynch vote but I liked pisskop for fighting against it. <br>\n<br>\n569 makes me wonder what the thought process is, and I should have asked about it at the time. Quotes Aneninen's crummy case, calls it out for being that, but then still sheeps. 683 says it's because of \"little touches\" with unsub -- if unsub is still a top scumread, why vote me and not push back on unsub? Doesn't do so until 678 though. And someone should point out my \"little touches\" with unsub and let's see how it compares to Aneninen and farside.</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">pisskop</div>: Wouldn't mind specifically if you looked at the unsub section and talked to me about my thoughts vs. your case on unsub from 678.", "time": "Wed Mar 04, 2015 10:48 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=60635&start=800", "forum": "53", "thread": "60635"}

Would it be fair to say that you find my slot to be more suspicious than Massive? It sounds to me like your vote on Massive was based on a perceived (but not detailed) association between Massive and Unsub, as below:<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6614296#p6614296\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6614296#p6614296\" data-post-id=\"6614296\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 569</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=22990\">pisskop</a> wrote:</cite><br>\nhmmm.<br>\n<br>\nMassive/Unsub?<br>\nsi, sheep.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Massive</div></div></blockquote><br>\nSo, you mention suspicion of Massive and my slot, but again that particular pairing is unsubstantiated. Also, this occurs well before your \"explanation\" to Massive in Post 683. The timing here looks strange to me. First, you vote for Massive (569) and mention suspicion of a Massive/Unsub team. Then, Massive talks to you about Titus's count, and you change your vote to my slot (679). Then, without being asked, you told Massive about the \"little touches\" as an explanation of your vote (683). To me, it just feels strangely defensive or apologetic for you to say something like that to Massive when you'd already changed your vote, especially in light of your recent comment that Massive is a good lynch for today. What do you make of Massive asking you specifically for your impression of the re-read on my slot?<br>\n<br>\nAnyway, I really wanted to investigate this purported relationship between Massive and my slot.

(I'm not sure about this part, but he started to be very active about me after RC had jumped on me. Also, he didn't examine any of my town games.)<br>\n<br>\n(2) He makes scummy posts and fabricate reasons for them afterwards. You'll find more examples for this phenomenon, but the most blatant one was his <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">\"My instinct is to keep VDA alive so he'll shoot RC overnight.\"</div>. By that point, RadiantCowbells claimed Jailkeeper. Why would a townie suggest Vig-killing a town-PR?

Also, BBT seemed to waffle at the end of Day 2, alternating between wanting to lynch Massive, Anen, and Titus. It seemed to me like an attempt to absolve himself of responsibility for the lynch of what he thought would be a Town player, and the cases were never clearly laid out for us to see the thought process.

Later she speculates a lot about the forthcoming Massive-flip. Eg. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6633484#p6633484\">728</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6647764#p6647764\">806</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6647931#p6647931\">809</a>. Her basic assumption is: <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">\"if Massive flips town</div>. Also, she considers Massive an informational lynch. (eg. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6633484#p6633484\">728</a>. These things suggest me that she's sheeping the wagon without having own reads (which is, because of Massive's SK-flip, easy to be considered a scum sheeping a wagon). &#8211; Stronger scumtell.<br>\n(3) In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6639817#p6639817\">761</a> she prod dodged and promised a \"decent post\", which never arrived. &#8211; Minor scumtell.<br>\n(4) There's something else in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6647764#p6647764\">806</a>. <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">\"If he's Scum, then I have Farside as his partner, and either Dierfire or RC as the 3rd Scum.\"</div> &#8211; First of all, she contradicts her Farside-read in her next post (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6647931#p6647931\">809</a>). RC was Massive's possible partner (if Massive flips scum) in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6647764#p6647764\">806</a>, can't figure out in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6647931#p6647931\">809</a>, and scumread in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6661921#p6661921\">904</a> (in the beginning of Day3). Her reads are full of contradictions. &#8211; Medium scumtell. But!<br>\n(5) She used the phrase \"3rd scum\" in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6647764#p6647764\">806</a>, as far as I can remember earlier than everyone else. Why was she sure about the size of the scumteam at that point? In theory, before the Massive flip the Setup could have been eg. a 9:2:2 too! &#8211; Unless I'm an idiot, this is a huge scumtell.<br>\n(6) On Day3 she posted that she'd ISO things (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6661853#p6661853\">903</a>, posted her idea about the scumteam in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6661921#p6661921\">904</a> and said <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">\"Farside22/BlueBloodedToffee I've been scumreading since early on.

Yet again, her posts are inconsistent. &#8211; Medium scumtell.<br>\n(7) Later she asks readlists from everyone, and as I said, it's possible that she's trying to find a viable mislynch. (Then she sheeped NoLynch, but she never explained why.) &#8211; Mild scumtell. (Not scummy in itself but looks scummy in connection with the other things.)<br>\n(8) Also, she's speculation a lot about the Cop.

I tried to defend myself, of course, because I definitely didn't want to claim on Day1 &#8211; especially after RadiantCowbells's claim. (At that point I thought he might be a bad townie whose claim is real, as far as I can remember.)<br>\n<br>\nAs the game progressed, I developed a scumread on Massive, because he was playing the Regardless Of Card. (Scumreading me regardless of my content.)<br>\nAt that time most players were townreading Massive. That'swhy it was a perfect choice to Track him at Night.

I <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">intentionally</div> didn't care much about anyone else. Remember: I only knew that he was scum, I didn't know what sort of. (At that point I strongly thought that it's a Multiball. Even if I <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">thought</div> there might be another Vig in the game, it seemed to be <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">absurd</div> for the Vig to kill VDA &#8211; I'll talk about this later.)<br>\nBut I knew that I <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">HAD TO</div> get Massive lynched. Because...<br>\n...Massive chose the only game he could choose. <br>\nI think he realized at the beginning of Day2 that I have an investigate PR. He knew that it would be very scummy if he dropped his \"scumread\" on me &#8211; but he also knew if my wagon reached L&#8211;1 I'd claim and everything would be over for him. Even if I got lynched. So, he tried to build counterwagons. It almost worked, there was a point when Unsub/Dierfire got dangerously close to lynch. Had that happened, I would have had to claim.

During Day2 I watched everyone closely: who tries to protect Massive or who tries to attack me (Chainsawing)? Who jumps on his wagon without reasons? I thought I might find Massive's partner. <br>\nHis SK-flip was a piece of good and bad news at the same time. Good, because one faction is out. Bad, because I realized that I created the perfect wagon for the Mafia. I posted about it Yesterday. Recapitulation:  \"if Massive's town, Aneninen will be an easy lynch, if he's scum, even better for us, lol\". So, instead of finding Massive's \"non-existent partners\" I started to examine his wagon. My Day3 posts were mostly about this.<br>\n(I knew that I didn't earn any town credit for lynching Massive but I found this way less important.)<br>\n<br>\nOf couse I'll reveal my Day2/Day3 investigations too, but I'd like to see claims from all of you.

He pointed it out later, on Day2 too, I found it by that time, I think. <br>\nAnd it made perfect sense... an Even-Night Vig and an Odd-Night Vig. Farside, wherever you are, you did it right! ^_^<br>\n<br>\nThat's the reason why I found BBT town. And BBT, I suggested ISO-ing your predecessor partly because of this. (And partly because I think Farside knew that I have an investigative-PR.)<br>\n<br>\nAlthough I understood the whole story Today. Being a Bulletproof, Farside wanted to \"steal the Nightkill\". This makes perfect sense because before BBT's claim I wasn't able to answer a disturbing question. If Farside/BBT's Even-Night Kill, where did the Night1 kill go? According to Farside's posts I doubted that she had killed VDA. A double-kill on Ellie or a no kill from her seemed to be more possible.<br>\n<br>\nThe question is: why did they kill RadiantCowbells and why did they try to kill BBT last Night? It seems to be very probable that BBT would have been the Nightkill, so unless it gets refuted I'm assuming it. <br>\nThese are the possible answers.<br>\n<br>\n(1) The scums didn't get any of the crumbs and they went for BBT, not knowing his PR. The first two Nightkills suggest this version. At Night3 they could have killed Titus or Klingonette (if they're town), or, obviously, me. But: if so, why did they choose BBT? What did he post?<br>\n<br>\n(2) The scums found Farside's crumb. If so, why did they kill RadiantCowbells first? Maybe they have a (x-shot) Bulletproof too? After all, Massive was Bulletproof, and we have a 1-shot Bulletproof... However, there can't be more than one Mafia-Bulletproof, I think. Also, if they've found the crumb, they too might have thought that Farside/BBT is Odd-Night Vig. If so, it would have been much better to kill BBT at Night2 and not to let him Vig-kill at Night3.<br>\n<br>\nFor me, (1) seems to be more likely. Also, anyone who was scumreading BBT last night is FoS. <br>\n<br>\nAlso: why am I still alive? Either they haven't ever thought that I'm a Tracker, or they have something that counters me. A JOAT or a 1-shot Ninja?</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\nTL;DR:<br>\nMassive Visited Ellie at Night1. That'swhy I deathtunneled him. <br>\nI'll reveal my Day2/Day3 targets after the missing roleclaims, because I want to make it hard for the scums fake-claim a PR. I'll post my thoughts about everyone afterwards.<br>\nI'm almost sure the Night3 target was BBT, although I don't know the reasons behind. BBT must be town and his claim must be real. <br>\n<br>\n________<br>\n<br>\nAlso, I don't think a NoLynch would be good Today. We might gain another investigation result if I'm still alive Tomorrow.

I called her \"bad townie\" because I thought her claim was real. I bought her claim because someone posted a game where she was claiming Cop and self-hammered in the same post. (And she was really a Cop.) <br>\nAs far as I can remember, at the end of Day1 I thought her claim was real. But, quite a few players thought that she was scum. As a Tracker, I thought that the scums might send the Nightkill from a generally un-suspected slot.<br>\nOn Day2, as I said in my long post, I intentionally didn't post too much about others than Massive. As the Day progressed, I started to develop a scumread on RadiantCowbells, because she was protecting Massive and attacking me. But with Massive's flip this read turned into pigeon poop.  Yet again, there were players suspecting her so I went for Flubber, a null-slot. Okay, he wasn't null after Massive's flip... remember, he kept saying that he wanted to get either Massive or me Lynched &#8211; and from the Mafia point of view, both were mislynch ideas.<br>\n<br>\nAs for the NoLynch: I think the possible gain is smaller than the possible loss if we perform a NoLynch.

If the claim is the reason for the change, why not check that claim by tracking Radiant? Especially after Radiant was refusing to claim night actions, it would make sense for Anen to look into that, but he didn't. He was even vocal about asking for the claims, so it's just hard for me to reconcile those two behaviors.</div></blockquote><br>\nRe-read my <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6588450#p6588450\">255</a> and I don't really understand what do you mean by \"backing off\". I called her \"bad townie\" because I thought her claim was real. I bought her claim because someone posted a game where she was claiming Cop and self-hammered in the same post. (And she was really a Cop.) <br>\nAs far as I can remember, at the end of Day1 I thought her claim was real. But, quite a few players thought that she was scum. As a Tracker, I thought that the scums might send the Nightkill from a generally un-suspected slot.<br>\nOn Day2, as I said in my long post, I intentionally didn't post too much about others than Massive. As the Day progressed, I started to develop a scumread on RadiantCowbells, because she was protecting Massive and attacking me. But with Massive's flip this read turned into pigeon poop.  Yet again, there were players suspecting her so I went for Flubber, a null-slot. Okay, he wasn't null after Massive's flip... remember, he kept saying that he wanted to get either Massive or me Lynched &#8211; and from the Mafia point of view, both were mislynch ideas.<br>\n<br>\nAs for the NoLynch: I think the possible gain is smaller than the possible loss if we perform a NoLynch. Unless you all want me to explain this, I won't do so because I don't want to give ideas to the scums.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nThe logic here doesn't make much sense to me. When people of whom I am suspicious (such as you) claim a role (such as Tracker) I tend to remain suspicious and evaluate the claim in the light of previous statements. If you are really the Tracker, then Radiant was a great target for you. You're saying that you didn't want to target Radiant because even if Radiant were Mafia the Mafia might send another member to perform the kill--but wouldn't that also give you a guilty result?

If the claim is the reason for the change, why not check that claim by tracking Radiant? Especially after Radiant was refusing to claim night actions, it would make sense for Anen to look into that, but he didn't. He was even vocal about asking for the claims, so it's just hard for me to reconcile those two behaviors.</div></blockquote><br>\nRe-read my <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6588450#p6588450\">255</a> and I don't really understand what do you mean by \"backing off\". I called her \"bad townie\" because I thought her claim was real. I bought her claim because someone posted a game where she was claiming Cop and self-hammered in the same post. (And she was really a Cop.) <br>\nAs far as I can remember, at the end of Day1 I thought her claim was real. But, quite a few players thought that she was scum. As a Tracker, I thought that the scums might send the Nightkill from a generally un-suspected slot.<br>\nOn Day2, as I said in my long post, I intentionally didn't post too much about others than Massive. As the Day progressed, I started to develop a scumread on RadiantCowbells, because she was protecting Massive and attacking me. But with Massive's flip this read turned into pigeon poop.  Yet again, there were players suspecting her so I went for Flubber, a null-slot. Okay, he wasn't null after Massive's flip... remember, he kept saying that he wanted to get either Massive or me Lynched &#8211; and from the Mafia point of view, both were mislynch ideas.<br>\n<br>\nAs for the NoLynch: I think the possible gain is smaller than the possible loss if we perform a NoLynch. Unless you all want me to explain this, I won't do so because I don't want to give ideas to the scums.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nThe logic here doesn't make much sense to me. When people of whom I am suspicious (such as you) claim a role (such as Tracker) I tend to remain suspicious and evaluate the claim in the light of previous statements. If you are really the Tracker, then Radiant was a great target for you. You're saying that you didn't want to target Radiant because even if Radiant were Mafia the Mafia might send another member to perform the kill--but wouldn't that also give you a guilty result? If Radiant doesn't visit anyone after claiming to be the Jailkeeper then you would know that the claim was a lie.<br>\nI won't ask you reveal whatever this \"possible loss\" is, but I want to know which players you would favor lynching and why.<br>\n<br>\nWith regard to this thing with Klingon...<br>\nI estimate the chances that Klingon, Pisskop, and BBT are all Town as very low, but hadn't we better avoid giving the Mafia any chance to rush a lynch anyway? We have 10 days until the deadline so there's no need to leave anyone within striking distance of a hammer.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nI was thinking more of the last paragraph regarding Klingon Pisskop and BBT is what I agree with. The first paragraph isn't bad, but should be punted on until after scum's nightkill.

Even the given explanation, that she was encouraging the Cop to check her, would be somewhat self-serving and there doesn't seem to be much of a reason for that.<br>\n2. She admits that she would be targeting BBT if she chose the night kill. I find it very likely that BBT was targeted, so that's a point against her.<br>\n3. Speaking of BBT, I find her recent responses to BBT to be strange. She leaves her vote on when I speculate that BBT was the night kill, but she moves immediately when Titus agrees with me. I must believe that she was responding more to the person than to the case. Then, she moves back when BBT mentions the above.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">@Klingon</div><br>\nThree last things:<br>\n<br>\n1.

As I mentioned before, there is guaranteed to be at least one Mafia on the Massive wagon. As a side note, I once again found myself not liking Pisskop's play on Day 2. However, that is not my focus right now, since I know that there must be Mafia on the wagon itself (living players: Anen, BBT, Varsoon, Flubber).<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Anen</div><br>\nDay 2 was a good day for Anen. He was correctly pushing the Massive wagon in a way that accords well with his claimed Night 1 result. His vote on the Massive wagon was well-reasoned. I like the vote. The one thing that was possibly strange was the way that he persistently read BBT (and Radiant, for that matter) as Town, but I have decided that Anen's claimed thoughts are largely trustworthy.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">BBT</div><br>\nBBT spends a lot of time in position to drop a hammer on Massive but does not do so immediately. He spends appropriate time looking at Anen's ISO (which was not that great for Day 1). The vote goes on just as the time is running out. I like the vote, as I think that a Mafia player could more easily have fabricated a case on Massive and then dropped the hammer.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Varsoon</div><br>\nVarsoon casts the final vote for Massive as time runs out. There's nothing especially alignment-indicative about this to me. It seems that I've been saying this for the entire game, but I really would like to see more content from Varsoon in order to get a better read. However, TT seemed to be putting significant effort in to attempt to solve the game before replacing out. The vote in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6616022#p6616022\">Post 592</a> looks good to me. Such a strong push (also seen in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6616312#p6616312\">Post 595</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6621158#p6621158\">Post 616</a>) seems to me much more like Town against perceived Mafia than as Mafia against perceived Town (as Massive would have been perceived by all Mafia players at that point).<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Flubber</div><br>\nThe vote for Massive in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6647508#p6647508\">Post 804</a> carries no explanation and is obviously without meaningful effort.

BBT already pointed these things out in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6726512#p6726512\">Post 1407</a>. Finally, I should note that if Anen and Massive were both perceived as Town by the Mafia players, then Flubber's stated willingness to vote either makes sense as awaiting the argument to turn clearly against one or the other (as it did) before casting a vote (as he did).<br>\n<br>\nIn summary: I find Flubber's vote on the Massive wagon to be the worst, and would certainly prefer to lynch Flubber to any of the other players on that wagon (Anen, Varsoon, or BBT). My next step is to determine whether I would prefer to lynch Flubber now or vote for the no-lynch option and which player I would think is on a team with Flubber.", "time": "Thu Apr 02, 2015 8:00 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=60635&start=1525", "forum": "53", "thread": "60635"}
