Nobody wants to be a loser.<br> 2] Do not take screenshots or directly quote any of the PMs that I send you. Doing so will result in a mod-kill. Pretending to break this rule is the same as actually breaking it. You may paraphrase, but use caution. When in doubt, run it by me first.<br> 3] Do not edit any of your posts, if you have the ability to do so.<br> 4] Do not use encrypted text, hidden text, small text, or any other hard-to-read text when posting.<br> 5] Once you have been lynched or killed, you are out of the game. Do not post anymore until the game is over. That means no \"Bah!\" posts, please.<br> 6] Do not talk about this game with anybody else outside of this thread unless your role PM explicitly says that you can.<br> 7] Heated discussion is fine, but personal attacks, insults, flaming, and poor sportsmanship are not. Please don't be a jerk to your fellow players. If I feel that your behavior is preventing other players from enjoying the game, I reserve the right to force-replace or mod-kill you.<br> 8] Do not talk about ongoing games. Like really, come on...<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #800080\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Day, Night, and Twilight:</span></span></span><br> 9] Each Day phase will last for two weeks apiece and each Night phase will last for two days. I will post specific deadlines in the game thread at the start of every Day and Night phase.<br>10] Players may continue to talk during Twilight, including the player that has been lynched.<br>11] If you do not send me your Night action before the specified deadline, I will assume that you are not performing an action on that Night. <br>12] If you know you will be unavailable during a Night phase, you may send me your night action during the preceding Day phase if you so desire.<br>13] Deadline extension requests will be considered on a case-by-case basis.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #800080\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Voting:</span></span></span><br>14] Please post all votes and unvotes using either the bold tag or the vote tag. Nicknames are fine, as long as I can understand them. Votes should look like this: <span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote:Boonskiies</span> or <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Boon</span><br>15] Unvotes are helpful, but not necessary.<br>16] Please refrain from engaging in any kind of voting trickery. If it looks like a vote, I'm counting it as a vote.<br>17] A lynch will only occur when a majority (more than 50% of all possible votes) is reached. The number of votes needed to hammer will be included with every vote count.<br>18] If a majority is not reached by the deadline, there will be no lynch on that Day.<br>19] Once a hammer occurs, no votes or unvotes will prevent the lynch from happening.<br>20] Additional votes include VOTE: No Lynch to end the Day with no lynch (which will also require a majority) and VOTE: Draw to end the game in a draw (which will require 100% agreement from all living players).<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #800080\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Activity:</span></span></span><br>21] You will be expected to post at least once every 48 hours. If you go more than 48 hours without posting, you will be prodded.<br>22] If you receive a prod, you will have 24 hours to post in the game thread. If you do not respond to your prod within 24 hours, you will be replaced. Additionally, if I have to prod you more than three times, you will be replaced.<br>23] If you know that you will have limited access to the game for more than a few days, please let me know either in the thread or via PM.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #800080\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Communication with the Moderator:</span></span></span><br>24] I may be pretty close to perfect, but I do still make mistakes every now and then. If you notice an error with the vote counts, deadlines, or anything else related to the game, please let me know and I will correct the issue.<br>25] I will not answer any role-related questions in the game thread. If you have any questions about your role, the (theoretical) roles of any other players in the game, or (theoretical) role interactions, send me a PM. Do not try to trick me into confirming a player's role. I will not be amused.<br>26] If you need to get my attention, just include @Mod or @Boon in your post. Also, bolding will help catch my eye.<br><br><span style=\"color: #800080\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Miscellaneous:</span></span></span><br>27] If you have any problems with another player, send me a PM and I will do my best to resolve the issue.<br>28] If a player is mod-killed during the Day phase, then that Day will end immediately.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #800080\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">29] My color is Purple (#800080) DON\u2019T USE IT.</span></span></span><br>30] The flavor text is for entertainment purposes only. Analyze it at your own risk.<br>31] Do not ask me to mod-kill, force-replace, or discipline any other player in the game. That is my decision to make, not yours.<br>32] As the moderator, my word is final. Please respect my instructions and my decisions.<br>33] I reserve the right to change these rules during the game if necessary. If this happens, I will inform everybody of the rule change in the thread.<br>34] In addition to these rules, all site-wide rules also apply.<br>35] Claiming color code is prohibited. <br>36] I live in California, and have Pacific Standard Time.<br><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #800080\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Sample Vanilla Townie:</span></span></span><br>37] At least one person will receive this PM.<br><br><fieldset style=\"border:3px outset grey; padding:5px 10px\">Welcome, [Player Name], you are a <span style=\"color: #00BF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vanilla Townie</span>.</span></span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #0040BF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Abilities:</span></span></span><br>\u2022 During the day, you can vote and talk<br>\u2022 You do nothing special.<br><br><span style=\"color: #0040BF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Win condition:</span></span></span><br>You win when all threats to the town have been eliminated and there is at least one town player alive.<br><br>Game thread is here.

Anyway\u2026many players act like as soon as you vote for someone, you 100% believe that they are scum. That should actually very rarely be the case. As town, we know nothing and should suspect everyone especially in DAY 1 with no info. In the above comment I implied that Flubber could be town after all. Maybe I hadn't explicitly stated that possibility earlier, but that should be a given at all times. I probably ultimately cast my vote because I was annoyed at him. Looking back we were both being jerks so I am more calmed down now, especially since further posts have proven him a bit more useful and a bit less annoying.  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\">  Am I backpedaling or just evolving?<br><br>Further in post #109 with all the quoting.

Since I found Flubber's response annoying and I was going to call it a night for myself, I decided to place my post RVS vote on him right away .<br><br>And then this nice little annotation\u2026partially explained above. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6581919#p6581919\" class=\"postlink\">post 109</a>, Aneninen wrote:</cite><br>And then the post you asked about:<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6581280#p6581280\" class=\"postlink\">post 90</a>, unsub wrote:</cite>Forgot, maybe. I answered it in my head but forgot to put it down on \"paper\" I guess. Got caught up with the aftermath. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Town or not, I am not impressed with Flubber's play. If he is trying to be witty or clever, I dont see how it helps town at all.</span> I think he has a longer term strategy to be out of ordinary so that other players will pay no mind to him when he is scum. He already tried citing other games a couple times, wanting other players to come to the conclusion \"that's just how Flubber is...he can't be scum, let's let him do his thing and confuse things until the very end\". I think a player like him is just a liability. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">If he is town, he's not helping by making a few of us focus on him and we let scum fly under the radar.</span></div></blockquote><br><br>The first underlined part is a backpedalling.<br>The next part makes very little sense. Assuming a long term strategy on early-Day1 is WTF. He didn't cite other games. Massive did that because I asked him to do so. And even if I (or some of us) think that this early gameplay might come from a town-Flubber, it's clear that this read in itself won't be enough later. <br>The last part is a bit paradox. If he's town he helps the scum fly under the radar. So, if he's scum, shouldn't he fly under the radar instead of getting focused by many players? <br><br>Okay, \"backpedalling\" might not have been the best word for that. But I think I've managed to make it clear why I find his posts strange. It seems that he's trying to make up something out of nothing.</div></blockquote><br><br>\t1. I did not backpedal. (which you kinda concede there at the end)<br>\t2. Flubber did cite other games. First time in post #38, second time #88 although I admit that one was prompted by another player. (You gotta understand that I am reading things on my phone and won't remember exact details but I knew it happened, I didn't just come up with it out of thin air.)<br>\t3. Given that people often like to reference other games and set themselves up to look town or give false impressions, I don't think it's far-fetched to say that a player is setting themselves up for a longer term strategy. It is easy to be random and annoying early in the game, and if he were to do that every game he could cite those games in his favor. You may say my thinking is paranoid or that I am a noob for thinking this way but as an economist I like to think macro as well as micro. <br>\t4. About the paradox - It's not really about what he should be doing if he is scum/town, it's about how he is being perceived regardless of his underlying intentions.  If he is scum, his play makes him obvious and if he is town, he is not helping town by being scummy, is he? Thus a liability either way. <br><br><br>BRB while I go write a whole book."}

As a townie I'm much more careless, sometimes I mix up things, forget to answer questions, ignore less significant looking players etc. As a scum I \"cross the T-s and dot the I-s\" so as to look \"very town\". Eg. I try not to leave any \"holes\" in my posts. I'm not a very experienced player either. (As for online Mafia. in RL Mafia I have more than 20 years of experience.)<br>Your posts gave me a similar impression. But since you're a newer player with no meta, I think this is a mere \"style-tell\", not a scumtell. (FYI I know players who has quite a similar townplay.)"}

If I was scum, why would I actually take the time to analyze and explain and only make it hard on myself to keep track of all the lies. <br>In short, commentary varies and if anything it makes more logical sense that scum stays quiet more often than not.

They had been waiting until vehement town-vs-town fights started to emerge. But I've seen very town-looking scums too (ehm, Farside, have you ever seen something similar? ^_^), just as well aggressive posters, even 1-vs-1 fighters. <br>So, statistically, it's very likely that at least one scum is flying under the radar but I'd doubt that all of them are doing this now. <br><br>As for \"over-explaining\". That's an impression. You know, I read my very first scumgame again not so long ago and I realized that I was \"over-explaining\" everything all the time. (Massive was there anyway. You can ask him too.) What do I mean by that? As a townie I'm much more careless, sometimes I mix up things, forget to answer questions, ignore less significant looking players etc. As a scum I \"cross the T-s and dot the I-s\" so as to look \"very town\". Eg. I try not to leave any \"holes\" in my posts. I'm not a very experienced player either. (As for online Mafia. in RL Mafia I have more than 20 years of experience.)<br>Your posts gave me a similar impression. But since you're a newer player with no meta, I think this is a mere \"style-tell\", not a scumtell. (FYI I know players who has quite a similar townplay.)</div></blockquote><br><br>Thanks, you make some sense. <br><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6584464#p6584464\" class=\"postlink\">post 176</a>, massive wrote:</cite><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6584031#p6584031\" class=\"postlink\">post 164</a>, unsub wrote:</cite>I was stating my point of view on this exchange between two players, something we should all do.

If I was scum, why would I actually take the time to analyze and explain and only make it hard on myself to keep track of all the lies. <br>In short, commentary varies and if anything it makes more logical sense that scum stays quiet more often than not.

They had been waiting until vehement town-vs-town fights started to emerge. But I've seen very town-looking scums too (ehm, Farside, have you ever seen something similar? ^_^), just as well aggressive posters, even 1-vs-1 fighters. <br>So, statistically, it's very likely that at least one scum is flying under the radar but I'd doubt that all of them are doing this now. <br><br>As for \"over-explaining\". That's an impression. You know, I read my very first scumgame again not so long ago and I realized that I was \"over-explaining\" everything all the time. (Massive was there anyway. You can ask him too.) What do I mean by that? As a townie I'm much more careless, sometimes I mix up things, forget to answer questions, ignore less significant looking players etc. As a scum I \"cross the T-s and dot the I-s\" so as to look \"very town\". Eg. I try not to leave any \"holes\" in my posts. I'm not a very experienced player either. (As for online Mafia. in RL Mafia I have more than 20 years of experience.)<br>Your posts gave me a similar impression. But since you're a newer player with no meta, I think this is a mere \"style-tell\", not a scumtell. (FYI I know players who has quite a similar townplay.)</div></blockquote><br><br>Who me?!

I didn't explain it because I thought it was obvious.<br><br>As for Demerine, I know that you won't believe my answer but the truth is that I misread her post, I read <span style=\"font-style: italic\">\"If he's scum, he'll <span class=\"noboldsig\">f</span>lip.\"</span> instead of <span style=\"font-style: italic\">\"If he's scum, he'll <span class=\"noboldsig\">s</span>lip.\"</span>.<br><br><br>Farside, the ISO of Pramitz I made in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6583480#p6583480\">150</a> contains quite a lot of scummy things about him."}

Basicly all of his content consists of that, even his reads on others are associated with his scumread on me. (He liked Demerine's post because I didn't like it. He leans scum on Klingonette because she doesn't scumread me.)<br><br>(2) I've been trying hard to maintain the discussion with him. Nothing has changed his reads, he has been interpreting everything as scummy, regardless of my answers. (That's what I call Regardless Of Card.) All of my answers are scummy or insufficient. <br>If I have a scumread on someone on Day1, I'm usually much less confident and sooner or later I usually find at least one thing which makes me think and question myself. (Even if I don't change my reads later.)<br><br>(3) I think he's simply going for the low-hanging fruit, riding the waves of hysteria generated by RadiantCowbells. (It's also possible that RC used to be his first target and that low-hanging fruit suddenly moved to the highest branch.)<br><br>(4) I've been thinking and I can add this too. It's strange that he started to build his case on my scumgame of our common game, because his Day1 gameplay was very different there. He was much less active and he interacted with much more players.<br>Also, apart from his meta-ing his whole case boils down to something like \"he's scummy beacuse his style is scummy and it's scummy because I say so, his reads are gimme reads because I say so, etc-etc.\" <br><br><br>I posted this in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6589641#p6589641\">265</a> <span style=\"font-style: italic\">\"lean town in itself but it <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">greatly depends on his forthcoming answers</span>\"</span> <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">partly</span> because I wanted to see whether he's a townie who's misreading me or a scum who wants to push a wagon to mislynch.

I can believe (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6582976#p6582976\">137</a>) that he didn't count the votes of Farside (especially since he's new to MafiaScum.) On the other hand, I think that he turned his RVS on Unsub to a real vote without giving no real reasons. (Still <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6582976#p6582976\">137</a>.) His later walls are mostly about Unsub and it seems that he's scumreading her using the Regardless Of Card. He's interacting with very few players and doesn't give reads on anyone apart from Unsub and RadiantCowbells. It's easy to imagine that these posts are coming from a scum who's trying to get as few \"enemies\" as he can get.<br><br>As I've already mentioned: I think it's silly to vote for a slot whose player might be replaced soon. If needed, I'll give a more detailed explanation for that.</div></blockquote><br><br>So the reason why I didn't give any real reasons (and a part of the reasoning for my latency in posts here on MS) is because things have been hectic, pretty much on and off in my life for responses. However, those \"later walls\" you mentioned were meant to support my reasoning in 137. It's also the reason I've been interacting with very few players.

As for the whole list thing, I don't get it at all. I can't think of one occasion where whether placing oneself on a t/s is alignment indicative. For instance, I tend not to put myself on my own t/s list whatever I roll. If Kling is in the habit then fine. If she then made one list with her name and one without then so what? I don't believe that is a scumtell, a scumslip or whatever people are implying it is. As for the lack of scumreads, why would scum do that? They want mislynches Day 1. If Kling was scum, and trying to get RC mislynched only for RC to claim power, then why not start scumreading someone else?"}

Still don't understand how 150 works ... starts off saying RC and Pramitz are scum together, quotes an RC post that Aneninen agrees with almost completely, but still calls it \"overdriven\" and votes RC over Pramitz. This is completely reliant on his correctly reading \"scum-scum interaction\" and completely ignoring the seven scummy things he listed about Pramitz. <br><br>Soft-defends unsub in 151. Harder-defends unsub in 154 (trying to push unsub's gameplay onto a \"playstyle\" and hush him, rather than trying to get him to overexplain more). 171 tries to deflect RC who points out exactly what I pointed out above, AND calls it tunnelling (when 150 really is scummy). 172 buddies Farside. 172 pushes himself and unsub as town. <br><br>178 claims to be doing more work than the average player, and asks to ISO him, and since I am right now, I can tell you his work has mostly been coaching unsub and the pretty bad 150. <br><br>234 soft-defends unsub. 234 claims to have posted \"a lot\" about RC (in actuality 3 posts), claims to have posted about how bad self-voting is (never did), claims he posted about RC's style being a red herring to cover up scumminess (he never did) -- he's hopping on a lot of other people's posts. 255 abandons RC? 255 also outright states RC is a \"bad townie\" -- need to check if RC has claimed by this point or not. (JUST had, in 246.) 260 \"too much effort\" on RC (again, now 4 or 5 posts) and that effort appears to be \"pushing other people's cases\" and \"quickly believing her roleclaim.\" <br><br>I still think that \"I'll re-examine everyone\" at the end of 260 comes off like an easy scum \"I'll be back to do more work\" throwaway comment, and without me calling him on it, 265 and 268 probably don't happen. 265 top townread is (unsurprisingly) unsub, top scum are Klingoncelt, Titus, Pramitz, but doesn't vote any of them. Comes back to 150 in 278 and STILL doesn't vote Pramitz, despite reiterating that RC's points on him could be true. Pramitz is his top scumread at this point. <br><br>282 soft-defends unsub. 282 confirms Pramitz as top scumread, still no vote. 291 is AtE and demands I read his town-meta, and I still maintain I hate relying on meta either way, I think it's lazy. 296 is happy that I am going away but still takes that opportunity to start turning the tables into a scumread on me. Evidently I've already harped on the \"not voting Pramitz\" thing because he defends (?) not voting, and tries to push it as avoiding giving me fuel to tunnel him on. 300 tries to pass off his scummy behavior as me tunnelling. <br><br>301, after demanding people read his meta, is sad when that doesn't exactly turn up the results he wants. 304 dismisses my reads as associative when they aren't. 304 dismisses his scummy answers as me tunnelling, not as him actually being scummy, which I guess you have to expect. 304 again blanket-believes RC's roleclaim without real reason (calling her the \"highest branch\" in his low-hanging fruit analogy). Still don't see him as low-hanging fruit there. <br><br>304 tries to call my meta into the argument. 304 claims saying \"forthcoming answers\" was to see if I was misreading him or was scum; at 265 I had just started scumreading him so this is OMGUS-in-waiting? <br><br>306 asks people to re-read and assume he's town. I never understood this. He's not asking people to be impartial or to re-read from both sides, just from the side where he's town. <br><br>313 claims I cherrypick questions to answer, and yeah, I do. It's because I'm more interested in playing my own game, rather than helping someone else play theirs. You want to learn more about someone? Ask your own questions, don't wait for others to do so. I generally only comment on things that I want more information about.<br><br>(Plus, if I'm scumreading someone, why WOULD I answer their questions?)<br><br>313 tries to brush off the meta-read again. 352 tries to play me trapping VDA as me coaching VDA. I think anyone who reads that can see I think VDA's vote is junk and am trying to get him to confess that his vote is junk, and not that I'm coaching him. If anyone's tunnelling at this point, it's Aneninen. <br><br>356 attacks me by claiming he's not doing something because I'd scumread him for it. 383 continues the \"massive coaching VDA\" angle. Since VDA is now confirmed town, this obviously won't come back up, but his case on VDA and I being scum together in this post takes some IMMENSE jumps in logic. Anyone want to go back and look at this and tell me it's town-based?<br><br>427 farside asks why his read on Klingoncelt changed; he answers that it had changed, and why he was town-reading her early on, but not why he's scum-reading her now. Uses 427 to get a dig in on me when I'm not part of the discussion even. <br><br>563 praises Titus VCA while pointing out a flaw in it (farside stopping the VDA wagon, which I didn't even consider), but still is OK with it since it claims Pisskop and I are scummy because of it. Pramitz has disappeared as a scumread at this point. (Oh because Pramitz became Ellie, who died overnight.) 563 also has to change the massive / VDA interaction read since VDA is confirmed town. <br><br>567 is the start of the \"let's lynch massive because he wanted the vig to shoot RC\" angle of attack. 567 claims \"these are all the posts you made about RC\" which I later refute and Aneninen has to go back and call it \"posts about your READ on RC\" (and even one of these doesn't even mention RC at all). (Oh I see, I don't include her in the list of possible lynches I'd approve of, which doesn't have 2/3ds of the town in it either.)<br><br>583 defends RC but demands her results. In bold no less. We already know she didn't jailkeep either of the dead people or either of the killers, so how is this information beneficial? This reads more like \"admit you jailkeep'ed me so I can point this out.\"<br><br>603 is the change from \"posts about RC\" to my \"read\" on RC. 666 still pushing my \"read\" on RC. 685 ... I was waiting for someone, anyone to go \"clearly he's being cheeky when he's suggesting VDA vig RC.\"  I did not expect it to be pushed as serious for 100-plus posts. 685 soft-defends unsub. 732 tunnelling for me, while dismissing his saying I \"might not\" be town as ESL and not him saying his professed \"absolute scum\" read isn't as absolute as he'd like you to believe.<br><br><br>DEMERINE / TITUS<br><br>Like 96. I've said I like 149 as well. Not sure Demerine would have ultimately been easier to read than Titus, but I liked where this was going. Titus enters at 280 and between 280 and 422 (six posts, 1-6 ISO) says ... absolutely nothing. Votes Klingoncelt for no reason, wants an unsub flip for no reason. Between 488 and 540 (ISO 7-17) pushes any lynch at all without mentioning any of the targets as scummy, relying solely on bandwagon pressure. Would think that this would play into the upcoming VCA, maybe? That TItus would discount the trains she was aggressively pushing? 540 says lynch pisskop tomorrow, mentions pisskop in the VCA, but doesn't ever go back to pisskop D2. <br><br>556 is the VCA. I just noticed something very interesting. How is it that neither Demerine nor Titus was on ANY of those trains showcased in the VCA? Even the one train Demerine is on, farside's, is the one Titus decides is on scum. I know there was some argument about how Titus wanted to be the lynch vote on at least one of the trains at the end of D1 (and various people were blocking it), but never voted on any of those wagons. Interesting. (Should probably be noted that Demerine was the active player for RC one and asked good questions about it, and was probably already absent by the Aneninen one.) <br><br>593 parrots Aneninen. Does she? Who's parrotting whom here? Aneninen's first post on this subject appears to be 563, so Titus is just parrotting it. 596 claims I \"haven't made any effort\" to get Aneninen lynched, but it's possible that all the action D1 happened after Demerine left but before Titus appeared, and we know Titus didn't read the thread before appearing (see 280). Also then likely that Titus didn't read the RC \"vig suggestion\" in context, but then why parrot it? Possibly OMGUS I guess? 598 claims I care about easy mislynches -- which are those exactly? 613 refers to \"grandma\" but no idea who that is. I assume farside. <br><br>636 DESPITE claiming to believe that I actually am suggesting legitimately that the vig shoot RC, makes reference to an off-site variant that (I assume) lets Titus have more aggressive control over RC's presence in the game. <br><br>647 evidently Grandma is Klingoncelt? Sorry farside! 662 claims \"yesterday's lynch felt off\" but makes no mention of her aggressive pushes in regards to it. <br><br>669 claims to have switched to me due to a \"good case being presented.\" vote switch is 568 and the \"good case\" is (likely) 563 and 567, because it's probably safe to assume that Titus didn't go back and read yesterday (and has actually said \"today is a new day, yesterday doesn't matter\") -- Is 563 a good case? Misunderstanding my interaction with VDA, now misunderstood a second time due to VDA's flip, and the RC \"vig\" comment. Is 567 a good case? Half the quotes from me about RC and more serious analysis of a flippant comment. Neither are good, but would Titus THINK they are good? Better than her own case on farside? At the time of her switch, it looked opportune, which is why I wanted to vote for her, and claiming it was a \"good case\" that caused her switch just doesn't add up.<br><br>ELLIE / PRAMITZ<br><br>Pramitz's vote is obviously RVS and there's no reason to see it seriously. Pramitz has seven posts, how does Pramitz get to be Aneninen's top scum read? How does he get to be voted by RC? Neither of those make sense, and I'm looking at RC's vote post since Pramitz quoted it whole. <br><br>Ellie joins at 399 and proclaims herself town, which makes me itch. (Other people noted this as well.) Ellie makes a good point in 407 on TT's jump from Aneninen to Ellie, so need to go back and look at that when I get to TT's ISO. Ellie is the first to bring up the RC \"vig\" comment in 523 and my also-cheeky response is 525. (Just for the people who want to say I changed my story somewhere today.)</div></div></div><br><br>It actually was good that Aneninen was first alphabetically and Demerine / Titus was second because seeing them in close proximity to one another made one thing pretty clear to me, and that's that it's unlikely that they're scum together. Either Aneninen is scum and Titus is dopily parroting him, or Aneninen has built a horrible case as town and Titus is riding along to see how long she can push it. If they were scum together, they'd be more likely to push different angles, and you would think that Titus wouldn't just immediately jump on board with her partner, so easily praising his case. The fact that they're both currently in \"bullying people for votes\" mode makes it tough to determine which is which, though.<br><br>It was also interesting to see Aneninen's overselling of his hard work for the town.

You're the worst tunneler ever, farside. 59 tries to push WIFOM as \"mind fucking with people,\" which is one aspect of it, but why is it null? When people do it to themselves (which is more likely, especially when dealing with conf-bias), it could be null, but people doing it purposefully should NOT be null. <br><br>113 moves off of Aneninen onto RC and that is the start of the RC wagon. That really was the worst tunnel ever. 117, 128 soft-defends unsub. Is there something about unsub that inspires other players to step in for them? <br><br>Continuing on RC seems like easy play here.<br><br>212 townreads Flubber for townreading unsub. 213-214 moves from RC to Ozgin. Was this before the claim? (not until 246) 213 says 180 is scum-Ozgin; the only reason I can see flat-out calling Ozgin scum due to 180 is because he's attack (guess!) unsub, who farside has already been soft-defending. 215 soft-defending unsub. 221 presents a \"case\" on Ozgin, which amounts to \"see how he only interacts with unsub! that's scummy!\" and we know now Ozgin is town. <br><br>Good question asking 259 (ISO 35) through 272 (ISO 39). 302 asks Anen about me and in 314 agrees it's tunneling, so it'll be interesting to see how that progresses D2. <br><br>392 says she won't vote Anen, and to read what she wrote and what TT wrote. All farside wrote about Anen is that she thinks he's town (386) and that he's tunneling (314), so what is she referring to? Will try and remember this when TT comes around.<br><br>412 soft-pushes away from VDA and Titus. Directing unsub? Not sure where that was supposed to go. <br><br>The VDA stuff reads legit frustrated. VDA was Thor-ing it up. She's trying to pry a response from VDA and he's just not budging. <br><br>467 soft-defends unsub. I am starting to think I am looking for it everywhere now.<br><br>657 claims unsub is the scum on the wagons (going off of Klingoncelt's VCA according to 660) but ... votes me. Does toss Titus's VCA as uninformative. <br><br>Farside's movement on me reads as logical. Move to unsub needs more data.<br><br>tldr: Farside is still town. Beginning to think I need to read unsub to see if people just want to stand up for them.<br><br>TROUBLEDTOWNIE<br><br>127 is working WAY too hard -- but just as \"wrong\" and not as \"scummy.\" <br><br>203 is right, and RC is wrong, as you can see from my ISO -- there are people guilty of protecting unsub, but it's not TT.<br><br>358 thinks like me on the VDA / RC / \"Adenine\" nonsense. <br><br>388 is good industry and right line of attack on the game. Conclusions are logical.<br><br>403 moves to Ellie for \"Hi, I'm town.\" Who was he voting for prior to this? Hrm, evidently Aneninen (298) and gave a fine reason, a better reason than his jump onto Ellie.<br><br>428 hey look I already said most of this! and gives a good answer to being called on his \"test vote\" on Ellie.<br><br>468 is fine, VDA's gameplay under pressure was not great and the continued pressure came from many places.<br><br>576 is bad but just oblivious, not malicious.<br><br>578 is absolutely correct. My statement is pure WIFOM. It ignores the fact that everything about the discussion about the RC \"vig\" comment is, in fact, WIFOM. <br><br>592 is a fine vote. The switch from passive player to tenacious bulldog is interesting. <br><br>tldr: I don't see scum-TT. I've been Thor'ing him a little bit but he thinks he has a bone and doesn't want to let it go, which makes sense from a town standpoint. Seems a little prone to tunneling and I hope he comes back before we hit deadline / get to twilight because I think I probably owe him straighter answers and less dickbaggery.</div></div></div><br><br>TLDR: I don't have any issue with farside being town, aside from the unsub-defending. Unsub really needs to be next. I don't see anything immediate in TT's ISO that points to him being scum, and he's giving shit because he's getting shit from me. He's prone to the tunnel and I'm pushing him into it, but that doesn't make him scum.<br><br>Everyone else tomorrow."}

Says she's fully on-board with the wagon on RC but doesn't want to move off of Flubber yet, but isn't really pushing in any way to determine Flubber's alignment any further. <br><br>168 points out that scum are more likely to lurk. I'd like to believe that no scum would point this out and then immediately go lurking. 168 also stands up nicely to Aneninen, especially on the \"explaining v. over-explaining\" nonsense.<br><br>191 RC's actions are all scum-tell, but still doesn't move vote from Flubber. At this point RC is at L-1 so that's not necessarily a tell at all. <br><br>249 \"go back and assume I'm town\" ... I don't know why numerous people have made this request in this game, but I still don't understand why this is a request a townie has to make. Town's job is to be obviously town so if you're making this request, clearly you are doing something scummy, and you know it.<br><br>250 moves his vote. RC is no longer at L-1 (farside unvoted in 213 and voted Ozgin in 214) but instead moves with farside to Ozgin for arguably quite weak reasons. It is right after RC's role claim though (246) so possibly a logical abandonment of the RC suspicions. The Ozgin vote is still kinda weak.<br><br>307 soft-defends Aneninen. I'm still not sure how Aneninen could POSSIBLY be perceived as an \"easy lynch\" or \"low hanging fruit\" at this point, so maybe someone should explain that to me. 307 also notes that he believe town-Titus would be more active upon entry and not just positioning to lynch, which is a very good point.<br><br>346 gets in on the VDA weird confusion.<br><br>I've already mentioned how 599 reads like fake scum sympathy.

I like the context of the defense (since it's contained with other events and questions). The entirety of the interaction between pisskop and RC is an attempt to get them back in the game, culminating in 243 -- so either they are scum together and pisskop is recklessly trying to salvage RC, or pisskop is the only one dealing with RC in a sensible manner. NOTE that 243 is prior to the roleclaim, though. <br><br>After RC has been saved, pisskop goes into fluff mode. ISO 13-22 or so before coming onto the Ozgin wagon. Really like 424 which shows that despite being fluffy in bits, pisskop is still paying attention to the game. <br><br>I have no idea why Titus was so determined to be the lynch vote but I liked pisskop for fighting against it. <br><br>569 makes me wonder what the thought process is, and I should have asked about it at the time. Quotes Aneninen's crummy case, calls it out for being that, but then still sheeps. 683 says it's because of \"little touches\" with unsub -- if unsub is still a top scumread, why vote me and not push back on unsub? Doesn't do so until 678 though.

I told massive I scumread you and there are associations between you two.  In addition, he is not a bad lynch for today.</div></blockquote><br>Right, but what are the associations? The only thing that I can find that resembles your above statement is here:<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6625749#p6625749\" class=\"postlink\">post 683</a>, pisskop wrote:</cite> .

I'm not sure about you, but I knew Unsub is scuzzy.</div></blockquote><br>Immediately afterward (Post 679) your vote goes on my slot, where it has remained. Would it be fair to say that you find my slot to be more suspicious than Massive? It sounds to me like your vote on Massive was based on a perceived (but not detailed) association between Massive and Unsub, as below:<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6614296#p6614296\" class=\"postlink\">post 569</a>, pisskop wrote:</cite>hmmm.<br><br>Massive/Unsub?<br>si, sheep.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Massive</span></div></blockquote><br>So, you mention suspicion of Massive and my slot, but again that particular pairing is unsubstantiated. Also, this occurs well before your \"explanation\" to Massive in Post 683. The timing here looks strange to me. First, you vote for Massive (569) and mention suspicion of a Massive/Unsub team. Then, Massive talks to you about Titus's count, and you change your vote to my slot (679). Then, without being asked, you told Massive about the \"little touches\" as an explanation of your vote (683). To me, it just feels strangely defensive or apologetic for you to say something like that to Massive when you'd already changed your vote, especially in light of your recent comment that Massive is a good lynch for today. What do you make of Massive asking you specifically for your impression of the re-read on my slot?<br><br>Anyway, I really wanted to investigate this purported relationship between Massive and my slot.

I've been working from Aneninen-farside-unsub as the scum team since seeing how Aneninen and farside both soft-defended unsub throughout the game, and it is certainly possible that I'm letting Aneninen color my reads on other players. The problem with this was, when I looked at unsub's posts, I didn't see it trafficking back to Aneninen or farside. Unsub stayed out of the Aneninen vs. massive row from D1, and the farside interaction was almost adversarial in spots. <br><br>I now think it's EITHER Aneninen + unsub (now Dierfire) OR Aneninen + farside (now BBT).

(No matter what I answered, everything only strengthened his scumread.) Originally, I developed my scumread on him because of this.<br>(1/2) Maybe he picked me because RadiantCowbells started scumreading me for silly reasons (you can check it) or because by using his direct meta about me it seemed to be easy to launch a case. (I'm not sure about this part, but he started to be very active about me after RC had jumped on me. Also, he didn't examine any of my town games.)<br><br>(2) He makes scummy posts and fabricate reasons for them afterwards. You'll find more examples for this phenomenon, but the most blatant one was his <span style=\"font-style: italic\">\"My instinct is to keep VDA alive so he'll shoot RC overnight.\"</span>. By that point, RadiantCowbells claimed Jailkeeper. Why would a townie suggest Vig-killing a town-PR? Also, why would a townie say that their \"instinct\" says to keep alive a claimed town-Vig (VDA)?!<br>(2/2) If he <span style=\"font-style: italic\">really</span> thought that I were scum, he should have suggested VDA killing ME! This: <span style=\"font-style: italic\">\"I have every intention of getting you lynched, and of having the satisfaction of you flipping scum, so why would I need him to kill you?\"</span>  explanation (in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6615472#p6615472\">584</a>) is pigeon poop. (By the way, in the same post he votes for Titus while he still scumreads me.)<br><br>(3) This is posted by me in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6633901#p6633901\">732</a>. (In short: he had been waiting for a long time to find something that he could call a \"slip\" before he found \"something\" he could jump on. Check out the \"something\" he found...)<br><br>(4) Having checked some earlier posts I found this in his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6634025#p6634025\">734</a>: <span style=\"font-style: italic\">\"I'm re-reading. Town will need my reads overnight once they see I am legitimately scumhunting. I realize I'm getting bogged down being on defense.\"</span> \u2013 Well, there were two Nightkills so the game may be a Multiball. If so, this might mean the following: \"I know that I'm going down but please, believe me that I've been trying to scumhunt, even if I'm scum\". (Rephrasing is mine, based upon the quote.) Why would anyone post \"I'm legitimately scumhunting\"?

Also, Anen has voted practically only for players that Mafia would have thought were Town.

Also, BBT seemed to waffle at the end of Day 2, alternating between wanting to lynch Massive, Anen, and Titus. It seemed to me like an attempt to absolve himself of responsibility for the lynch of what he thought would be a Town player, and the cases were never clearly laid out for us to see the thought process. I am thinking that the brief reads, followed by a vote on Anen, might be an attempt to win some credit if Anen flipped Mafia.</div></div></div>"}

(Not scummy in itself but looks scummy in connection with the other things.)<br>(8) Also, she's speculation a lot about the Cop.

Because...<br>...Massive chose the only game he could choose. <br>I think he realized at the beginning of Day2 that I have an investigate PR. He knew that it would be very scummy if he dropped his \"scumread\" on me \u2013 but he also knew if my wagon reached L\u20131 I'd claim and everything would be over for him. Even if I got lynched. So, he tried to build counterwagons. It almost worked, there was a point when Unsub/Dierfire got dangerously close to lynch. Had that happened, I would have had to claim.

Bad, because I realized that I created the perfect wagon for the Mafia. I posted about it Yesterday. Recapitulation:  \"if Massive's town, Aneninen will be an easy lynch, if he's scum, even better for us, lol\". So, instead of finding Massive's \"non-existent partners\" I started to examine his wagon. My Day3 posts were mostly about this.<br>(I knew that I didn't earn any town credit for lynching Massive but I found this way less important.)<br><br>Of couse I'll reveal my Day2/Day3 investigations too, but I'd like to see claims from all of you.

He pointed it out later, on Day2 too, I found it by that time, I think. <br>And it made perfect sense... an Even-Night Vig and an Odd-Night Vig. Farside, wherever you are, you did it right! ^_^<br><br>That's the reason why I found BBT town. And BBT, I suggested ISO-ing your predecessor partly because of this. (And partly because I think Farside knew that I have an investigative-PR.)<br><br>Although I understood the whole story Today. Being a Bulletproof, Farside wanted to \"steal the Nightkill\". This makes perfect sense because before BBT's claim I wasn't able to answer a disturbing question. If Farside/BBT's Even-Night Kill, where did the Night1 kill go? According to Farside's posts I doubted that she had killed VDA. A double-kill on Ellie or a no kill from her seemed to be more possible.<br><br>The question is: why did they kill RadiantCowbells and why did they try to kill BBT last Night? It seems to be very probable that BBT would have been the Nightkill, so unless it gets refuted I'm assuming it. <br>These are the possible answers.<br><br>(1) The scums didn't get any of the crumbs and they went for BBT, not knowing his PR. The first two Nightkills suggest this version. At Night3 they could have killed Titus or Klingonette (if they're town), or, obviously, me. But: if so, why did they choose BBT? What did he post?<br><br>(2) The scums found Farside's crumb. If so, why did they kill RadiantCowbells first? Maybe they have a (x-shot) Bulletproof too? After all, Massive was Bulletproof, and we have a 1-shot Bulletproof... However, there can't be more than one Mafia-Bulletproof, I think. Also, if they've found the crumb, they too might have thought that Farside/BBT is Odd-Night Vig. If so, it would have been much better to kill BBT at Night2 and not to let him Vig-kill at Night3.<br><br>For me, (1) seems to be more likely. Also, anyone who was scumreading BBT last night is FoS. <br><br>Also: why am I still alive? Either they haven't ever thought that I'm a Tracker, or they have something that counters me. A JOAT or a 1-shot Ninja?</div></div></div><br><br>TL;DR:<br>Massive Visited Ellie at Night1. That'swhy I deathtunneled him. <br>I'll reveal my Day2/Day3 targets after the missing roleclaims, because I want to make it hard for the scums fake-claim a PR. I'll post my thoughts about everyone afterwards.<br>I'm almost sure the Night3 target was BBT, although I don't know the reasons behind. BBT must be town and his claim must be real. <br><br>________<br><br>Also, I don't think a NoLynch would be good Today. We might gain another investigation result if I'm still alive Tomorrow. But, maybe we could narrow the lynch pool Today to have a good chance for lynching a scum. If lucky, we can even have a sure lynch and some chance to break the game."}

I called her \"bad townie\" because I thought her claim was real. I bought her claim because someone posted a game where she was claiming Cop and self-hammered in the same post. (And she was really a Cop.) <br>As far as I can remember, at the end of Day1 I thought her claim was real. But, quite a few players thought that she was scum. As a Tracker, I thought that the scums might send the Nightkill from a generally un-suspected slot.<br>On Day2, as I said in my long post, I intentionally didn't post too much about others than Massive. As the Day progressed, I started to develop a scumread on RadiantCowbells, because she was protecting Massive and attacking me. But with Massive's flip this read turned into pigeon poop.  Yet again, there were players suspecting her so I went for Flubber, a null-slot. Okay, he wasn't null after Massive's flip... remember, he kept saying that he wanted to get either Massive or me Lynched \u2013 and from the Mafia point of view, both were mislynch ideas.<br><br>As for the NoLynch: I think the possible gain is smaller than the possible loss if we perform a NoLynch.

If the claim is the reason for the change, why not check that claim by tracking Radiant? Especially after Radiant was refusing to claim night actions, it would make sense for Anen to look into that, but he didn't.

I called her \"bad townie\" because I thought her claim was real. I bought her claim because someone posted a game where she was claiming Cop and self-hammered in the same post. (And she was really a Cop.) <br>As far as I can remember, at the end of Day1 I thought her claim was real. But, quite a few players thought that she was scum. As a Tracker, I thought that the scums might send the Nightkill from a generally un-suspected slot.<br>On Day2, as I said in my long post, I intentionally didn't post too much about others than Massive. As the Day progressed, I started to develop a scumread on RadiantCowbells, because she was protecting Massive and attacking me. But with Massive's flip this read turned into pigeon poop.  Yet again, there were players suspecting her so I went for Flubber, a null-slot. Okay, he wasn't null after Massive's flip... remember, he kept saying that he wanted to get either Massive or me Lynched \u2013 and from the Mafia point of view, both were mislynch ideas.<br><br>As for the NoLynch: I think the possible gain is smaller than the possible loss if we perform a NoLynch. Unless you all want me to explain this, I won't do so because I don't want to give ideas to the scums.</div></blockquote><br><br>The logic here doesn't make much sense to me. When people of whom I am suspicious (such as you) claim a role (such as Tracker) I tend to remain suspicious and evaluate the claim in the light of previous statements. If you are really the Tracker, then Radiant was a great target for you. You're saying that you didn't want to target Radiant because even if Radiant were Mafia the Mafia might send another member to perform the kill--but wouldn't that also give you a guilty result? If Radiant doesn't visit anyone after claiming to be the Jailkeeper then you would know that the claim was a lie.<br>I won't ask you reveal whatever this \"possible loss\" is, but I want to know which players you would favor lynching and why.<br><br>With regard to this thing with Klingon...<br>I estimate the chances that Klingon, Pisskop, and BBT are all Town as very low, but hadn't we better avoid giving the Mafia any chance to rush a lynch anyway? We have 10 days until the deadline so there's no need to leave anyone within striking distance of a hammer."}

When people of whom I am suspicious (such as you) claim a role (such as Tracker) I tend to remain suspicious and evaluate the claim in the light of previous statements. If you are really the Tracker, then Radiant was a great target for you. You're saying that you didn't want to target Radiant because even if Radiant were Mafia the Mafia might send another member to perform the kill--but wouldn't that also give you a guilty result? If Radiant doesn't visit anyone after claiming to be the Jailkeeper then you would know that the claim was a lie.<br>I won't ask you reveal whatever this \"possible loss\" is, but I want to know which players you would favor lynching and why.</div></blockquote><br><br>I understand your logic, but you miss an important factor. RadiantCowbells was scumreading <span style=\"font-style: italic\">me</span>. I could have confirmed her if she had targetted me. So, in short, my logic was this:<br>If she's scum, it's very unlikely that she sends away the kill. Therefore targetting her confirms nothing. <br>If she's town, it's very possible that she may target me and I get a No Result instead of a \"real\" Tracker result. In that case, she gets confirmed. (Unless the scums have a Roleblocker or another Jailkeeper who targets me, but that would be silly after RC's and VDA's claim.)<br>By the way, that was the main reason behind asking her about her Night1 target. Had she told that she'd targetted me, I would have known that she was lying. <br>(Also, although unlikely, there would have been other possibilities. Eg. her claim is real but she didn't target anyone. She's indeed a Jailkeeper but Mafia Jailkeeper. Her claim is fake because she's a Bulletproof or a PGO or whatever.)<br><br>I'm posting my thoughts about everyone soon."}

If the claim is the reason for the change, why not check that claim by tracking Radiant? Especially after Radiant was refusing to claim night actions, it would make sense for Anen to look into that, but he didn't. He was even vocal about asking for the claims, so it's just hard for me to reconcile those two behaviors.</div></blockquote><br>Re-read my <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6588450#p6588450\">255</a> and I don't really understand what do you mean by \"backing off\". I called her \"bad townie\" because I thought her claim was real. I bought her claim because someone posted a game where she was claiming Cop and self-hammered in the same post. (And she was really a Cop.) <br>As far as I can remember, at the end of Day1 I thought her claim was real. But, quite a few players thought that she was scum. As a Tracker, I thought that the scums might send the Nightkill from a generally un-suspected slot.<br>On Day2, as I said in my long post, I intentionally didn't post too much about others than Massive. As the Day progressed, I started to develop a scumread on RadiantCowbells, because she was protecting Massive and attacking me. But with Massive's flip this read turned into pigeon poop.  Yet again, there were players suspecting her so I went for Flubber, a null-slot. Okay, he wasn't null after Massive's flip... remember, he kept saying that he wanted to get either Massive or me Lynched \u2013 and from the Mafia point of view, both were mislynch ideas.<br><br>As for the NoLynch: I think the possible gain is smaller than the possible loss if we perform a NoLynch. Unless you all want me to explain this, I won't do so because I don't want to give ideas to the scums.</div></blockquote><br><br>The logic here doesn't make much sense to me. When people of whom I am suspicious (such as you) claim a role (such as Tracker) I tend to remain suspicious and evaluate the claim in the light of previous statements. If you are really the Tracker, then Radiant was a great target for you. You're saying that you didn't want to target Radiant because even if Radiant were Mafia the Mafia might send another member to perform the kill--but wouldn't that also give you a guilty result? If Radiant doesn't visit anyone after claiming to be the Jailkeeper then you would know that the claim was a lie.<br>I won't ask you reveal whatever this \"possible loss\" is, but I want to know which players you would favor lynching and why.<br><br>With regard to this thing with Klingon...<br>I estimate the chances that Klingon, Pisskop, and BBT are all Town as very low, but hadn't we better avoid giving the Mafia any chance to rush a lynch anyway? We have 10 days until the deadline so there's no need to leave anyone within striking distance of a hammer.</div></blockquote><br><br>I was thinking more of the last paragraph regarding Klingon Pisskop and BBT is what I agree with. The first paragraph isn't bad, but should be punted on until after scum's nightkill. I don't like agreeing with my scumreads close to lylo.<br><br>Also, if Pisskop is town, he has to be rehabilitated. While I think he's scum, I don't know he is."}

I'm convinced that BBT is Town, and is therefore a clear choice for the Mafia to kill at night. Since this wouldn't give me any additional information, I'd like to proceed with a lynch today. My choice of lynch is Klingon. Reasons:<br>1. Given that Klingon is claiming VT, I have to read all of that speculation about the Cop during the last Day Phase as an attempt to gain information about player roles. Even the given explanation, that she was encouraging the Cop to check her, would be somewhat self-serving and there doesn't seem to be much of a reason for that.<br>2. She admits that she would be targeting BBT if she chose the night kill. I find it very likely that BBT was targeted, so that's a point against her.<br>3. Speaking of BBT, I find her recent responses to BBT to be strange. She leaves her vote on when I speculate that BBT was the night kill, but she moves immediately when Titus agrees with me. I must believe that she was responding more to the person than to the case. Then, she moves back when BBT mentions the above.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">@Klingon</span><br>Three last things:<br><br>1. Why do you not believe the claim by BBT?<br>2.

If Anen is Mafia, then the no-lynch option gets the confirmed Town player (BBT) killed. There's no benefit here.<br>2.

As I mentioned before, there is guaranteed to be at least one Mafia on the Massive wagon. As a side note, I once again found myself not liking Pisskop's play on Day 2. However, that is not my focus right now, since I know that there must be Mafia on the wagon itself (living players: Anen, BBT, Varsoon, Flubber).<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Anen</span><br>Day 2 was a good day for Anen. He was correctly pushing the Massive wagon in a way that accords well with his claimed Night 1 result. His vote on the Massive wagon was well-reasoned. I like the vote. The one thing that was possibly strange was the way that he persistently read BBT (and Radiant, for that matter) as Town, but I have decided that Anen's claimed thoughts are largely trustworthy.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">BBT</span><br>BBT spends a lot of time in position to drop a hammer on Massive but does not do so immediately. He spends appropriate time looking at Anen's ISO (which was not that great for Day 1). The vote goes on just as the time is running out. I like the vote, as I think that a Mafia player could more easily have fabricated a case on Massive and then dropped the hammer.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Varsoon</span><br>Varsoon casts the final vote for Massive as time runs out. There's nothing especially alignment-indicative about this to me. It seems that I've been saying this for the entire game, but I really would like to see more content from Varsoon in order to get a better read. However, TT seemed to be putting significant effort in to attempt to solve the game before replacing out. The vote in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6616022#p6616022\">Post 592</a> looks good to me. Such a strong push (also seen in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6616312#p6616312\">Post 595</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6621158#p6621158\">Post 616</a>) seems to me much more like Town against perceived Mafia than as Mafia against perceived Town (as Massive would have been perceived by all Mafia players at that point).<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Flubber</span><br>The vote for Massive in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6647508#p6647508\">Post 804</a> carries no explanation and is obviously without meaningful effort. Perhaps worse, it seems as though the intent was to justify the vote retroactively in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6654160#p6654160\">Post 876</a>. BBT already pointed these things out in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6726512#p6726512\">Post 1407</a>. Finally, I should note that if Anen and Massive were both perceived as Town by the Mafia players, then Flubber's stated willingness to vote either makes sense as awaiting the argument to turn clearly against one or the other (as it did) before casting a vote (as he did).<br><br>In summary: I find Flubber's vote on the Massive wagon to be the worst, and would certainly prefer to lynch Flubber to any of the other players on that wagon (Anen, Varsoon, or BBT). My next step is to determine whether I would prefer to lynch Flubber now or vote for the no-lynch option and which player I would think is on a team with Flubber."}
