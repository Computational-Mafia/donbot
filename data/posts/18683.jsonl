MINE! <br>\n4) Anything I say to another player is not to be quoted. <br>\n5) Players may NEVER PM each other about game related content. This is to ONLY be done in your QT, if you have one, at the appropriate time. <br>\n6) Small or invisible text is banned. You are not allowed to use coded messages either.<br>\n7) I will require players to post at least once every 48 hours. This is to keep the game moving. If you go more than 48 hours without posting I will prod you. If you don't post within 48 hours of the prod, you will be replaced. After the 3rd prod, if I have to prod you again I will just replace you instead.<br>\n8) V/LA's are to be posted in-thread in <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">BOLD</div>.<br>\n9) Weekends count as 24 hours<br>\n10) Days will last 2 Weeks<br>\n11) Nights will last 2 Days<br>\n12) To vote, post <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote:</div> Player. To unvote, post <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Unvote</div>. I do not require unvotes, but they are appreciated. Also, using the vote tags are greatly appreciated as well. <br>\n13) majority=(X Players+1 (If odd number))/2. So if 13 players exist, a majority would be 7.<br>\n14) Once a majority is reached, votes will not change. Players may continue to talk until I post the death scene.<br>\n15) If a majority isn't reached by the deadline, no lynch will occur that day.<br>\n16) Once you're dead, well, you're dead. No further speaking is allowed. No \"Bah!\" posts allowed.<br>\n17) Remember, this is a game! Play to win and have fun!<br>\n18) Modkilled players will become Neutral Survivors with a zero chance of winning.<br>\n19) Don't be stupid. <br>\n20) These Rules are subject to change.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Sample VT PM</div>:<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>You are a <div style=\"display:inline;color:#008000\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vanilla Townie</div></div>!

It's silly. And pointless. I was witness to this just awful game over on Myth-Weavers where a good many pages had devolved into some type of \"statistics as the best way to hunt scum\" debate that was mind-numbingly painful. Not to mention the guy espousing the view that randomly picking targets was a good way to hunt wound up as scum (at least, I'm pretty sure that's how it shook out). So any discussion that closely resembles that (in this case, the whole RNG thing) makes me wary. And anyone that argues too hard for RNG as a good way to scum hunt is immediately scummy in my eyes (can't help it. gut reaction).<br>\n<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\n^^ this is a complete misrep of the conversation. noone was arguing that \"rng is a good way to hunt scum\".<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>jam wrote:</cite>but overall I think if scum is paranoid about being found out due to their initial vote, they would just refrain from voting until more substance showed up </div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\n3) ^^ do you see how this correlates to your own behavior?<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>jam wrote:</cite>I'm not sure if Killer is scum or a VI, but either way, it's hard to say the lynch is undeserved, given his actions. With the votes piling up the way that they did, and the quickhammer being dropped, I'm inclined to think that Killer will flip town. Assuming he does, we definitely need to look closer at some of the people on that wagon during the upcoming Night phase, and grill em come Day Two. Even if he flips scum, I wouldn't be surprised if his scum buddy (buddies?) bussed him, so it would still probably be a good idea to look at the people on the wagon.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\n4) do you think anyone off the wagon is scummy at all, or needs to be looked at? you are basically saying that you don't like the wagon regardless of the flip. is the wagon more or less scummy now?<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>jam wrote:</cite><br>\nDon_johnson: Leaning town<br>\n<br>\nBenmage: Ehh...could go either way<br>\n<br>\nLewarcher: Leaning town<br>\n<br>\nGaylord: Scum.

I'm not sure if this site allows you to change posts per page or not. Not something I generally look into. I tend to leave things at default). Will go back earlier and see if any of his other posts stick out at me.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\na giant fence sit with a \"hey, lets attack the low content players.\" this is classic scum behavior imo.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">vote: jamftw</div><br>\n<br>\nplease answer the questions.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\n1)  There is a rather large difference, I feel, between voting for someone who has checked in and is remaining quiet as opposed to a person that hasn't even checked in yet.  If you've checked in, you're basically making a promise to the group that you're around, not too busy, and ready to play.  To remain quiet for an extended period afterwards is stretching into lurking territory.  If you've yet to check in/read your pm, this says to me that you are busy elsewhere, and perhaps now don't have time for the game as you would have when you signed up (real life has extraordinary ways to be a bitch like that).  This person will either check in later or get replaced.  I think it's a waste of a vote to vote for someone who has yet to acknowledge their commitment to the game.<br>\n<br>\n2)  Why self-vote when Sleuth was seeming scummy?  I put my vote where I think the scum are.<br>\n<br>\n3)  No, I don't see how that pertains to me.  This leads back to point one.  Sleuth had read his pm and responded, thereby making his commitment to the game.  Enough people had added in their two cents (eight total at that point, I believe?) where I felt a little prod was necessary.  And Sleuth's posts afterwards did little to convince me to remove said vote.<br>\n<br>\n4)  Honestly, gaylord was looking the scummiest on that wagon, given the quickhammer.  Given what we know now, I'm not so sure.<br>\n<br>\n5)  Much how you didn't like the \"tone\" of my messages, there was something that didn't quite sit right with me.  He disappears for pages at a time, comes in and apologizes for being absent, give a paltry one or two cents worth of his thoughts and then disappears again.  Not active lurking but...ehh, dunno.<br>\n<br>\n6)  With Ben it came down more to tone of posts.  Not something to base a vote off of, so I didn't do so.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Empking wrote:</cite>Lets massclaim quickly before it breaks the flow.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nThis.  This right here is scummy.  In an open game, sure it would work.  It would also break the game (Saw it happen once.  Some of the games over on Myth-Weavers that I've been a part of have outright forbidden the whole massclaiming thing.  Not that I'm saying I have that big a problem with it).  In a closed set-up, scum can pull some random role out of their ass (or just claim VT if it comes to it) and then they have a good idea of power roles for town.  No no no no no.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Empking wrote:</cite>2. We can keep scum from fakeclaiming.<br>\n3.

I don't really see him really taking offence, and instead I read that little bit as 2Birds1Stone looking for someone to pick on as soon as the gate drops.  Dislike.  A few people also pointed at 2B1S' saying the question is a trap, which I glanced right over and missed.  I don't see it being a trap either.  Whatever you like is whatever you like.  It isn't like the Mod gave you a role that he knew you would like.<br>\n<br>\n---------<br>\n<br>\nGoing to answer the question - I love to play a simple vanilla role-less townie.

I have been playing Mafia off and on since 2006, with most of it being live or fast games on chat/skype.  I have done a few forum style, but they were few and far between.  I really got back into Mafia again on another site in March, where I have played numerous games of all shapes and sizes.  Their games are by no means fast, but they are certainly faster than Mafia Scum (72 hour Day cycles are the norm).  This is my third game on Mafia scum, with my first two being Newbie games.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n-------<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nMafia jumps on the Killer vote wagon, but I don't really see his reasoning behind it.  I do see the connection between if Killer flips scum, a gambit with 2b1s.  Hellhound gets on the wagon as well, and his reasoning I agree with, but personally, just because someone is acting newb-tastic, I would not vote for them.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nGoing to pause here because it is late and I can barely keep my eyes open to keep reading.", "time": "Sat Sep 03, 2011 8:23 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=18683&start=350", "forum": "53", "thread": "18683"}

You would think that a Holiday would mean taking a break, but blah, so busy!  I am going to keep on with my reread and posting my thoughts, and document them here.  Continuing from <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3402200#p3402200\" class=\"postlink\">Post 370</a>.  My read has gotten me to the top of Page 3, which is during Day 1.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nPart of the Captain Haoala team gets onto Hellhound for the random.org voting, but a question is brought up about why Sleuth was waggoning, which I am wondering too.  He sort of answers it in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3336161#p3336161\" class=\"postlink\">Post 62</a>, but I am still wondering wtf.  Sleuth really needs an Avatar.  Kind of getting annoying.  Captain points out in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3338860#p3338860\" class=\"postlink\">Post 69</a> (haha) which Sleuth agrees with that there can be no tracks left by scum if they just randomly vote, which I can see, but I always RVS the person smack dab in the middle of the list, unless I know someone, which I then vote for them.<br>\n<br>\nJAMFTW shows up - you seriously get on Sleuth for not talking that much (which he isn't) yet you are barely talking at all?  Really?  Pot calling Kettle black, much?<br>\n<br>\nKiller makes himself seem pretty scumm at this point, and in my opinion, I would have thrown a vote on him about here, even with him being at L2.<br>\n<br>\nTeamsleep gets on Killer for poking at Sleuth for so few posts... seriously its like half of you aren't even playing at this point.  And, just to note, quality over quantity.  <br>\n<br>\n<br>\nBenmage was playing this game too?  The lack of people talking at this point is just sad.  No wonder no Mafia has died yet.  FoS on anyone being silent.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3341810#p3341810\" class=\"postlink\">Post 82</a>, DonJohnson puts Killer at L2, and points that the newb card is bull.  Thank you that someone said it.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3343532#p3343532\" class=\"postlink\">Post 84</a> 2B1S gets on Sleuth for still ignoring the accusations and questions asked of him.  I can see why there is a lynch train going on Killer, but my vote would have been on Sleuth at this point.  Killer then puts his vote onto himself... and then his explanation has me scratching my head.  Broski, you were acting scummy.  If you act scummy, you are gonna get votes.  Yes, there probably is Mafia on that train SOMEWHERE, but you were acting scummy.  Stop acting like you weren't.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nGaylord hammers... not really seeing what information could be had.  Sleuth once again is NOT paying attention.  Killer is lynched and.. he was Townie.  WTF.  Bro, you seriously sucked at this.  The lynch happened in... 6 Days?  And half of the people weren't even talking?  Wow.  2B1S killed over night and someone replaces in.  2B1S seemed a little suspicious at first, but tbh, he was not high on my list anymore, and I find it hard to find anything from his death.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nThis concludes Christine's read of Day 1.

I pretty much completely agree with all the points in this post.

I don't get why, given that there is only one vote on him, and he doesn't even seem to address the issues at hand.

They weren't like this on Day 1, and now I am thinking that they are plotting to have one flip mafia, therefore covering the other.  This has me suspicious of both of them.

Could it really be... a Ben-HH-DJ Mafia team?  Yeah, signs are aiming right at it.  Can't believe no one is screaming it at this point.<br>\n<br>\nAlso, on the note of Metas, I don't really like them, because the VERY good players can act Style A in a game they are town, Style B in a game they are mafia, then Style A in a game they are mafia, and Style B in a game they are town.

At this point, you need to gain a dictionary and a guide to grammar and punctuation.  Reading your posts is killing my eyes.

He votes for Team, and is then asked why he didn't vote for Gay by Ben... Seriously?  Scummy again Ben.  Gay is close to being lynched for other reasons, and the bone that Lew has to pick is with Team mainly.  Pay attention, please.<br>\n<br>\nJam in 166 is sitting on the fence.  That seems like either a very inexperienced move, or a mafia move.  Given that my eyes are glaring at the other three, I am going to go with inexperience.<br>\n<br>\nMafiafixed IS STILL HERE?!

Or, on Day 1?</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\ncap is town. confirmed. this line of questioning is a distraction.<br>\n<br>\ni agree with the \"pandering to town.\" add to that line you quoted, post 666:<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>chris wrote:</cite>I must agree, though, if CH is the scum, I applaud you for the gambit.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\n^^ this post is almost 2 hours after caps post. there is already a vote on chris. cap scum would have already won the game by now. chris is simply echoing my earlier sentiment. only it no longer applies. i consider this pandering moreso.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>cap wrote:</cite>Are you saying that Benmage was above all suspicion? I disagree. CC and I both felt that Benmage has been scummy since D1.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nlew and myself did most of the legwork on the benwagon, starting on day 2 i believe? but regardless, chris' only contribution to the benwagon was attempting to tie me to ben. this was only done during the day when ben suspicion was already gaining support, and it dissappeared after the ben flip. but now its back because chris is in the hotseat. bravo.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>chris wrote:</cite>But why would I attack Benmage? The only one of the two confirmed scum that was really getting glared at was Jam. Why not sacrifice the person that was already under suspicion?</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nno. this is false. jam had very little suspicion at that time. plus, jam flipped roleblocker. more valuable than goon. plus, you say \"two confirmed scum\", which again points to the fact that you know we are <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">all</div> town.<br>\n<br>\n671 is another giant AtE.<br>\n<br>\ncap: not sure how to answer \"why is dj town?\" i think my play speaks for itself. we are here as a direct result of my influence in this game. i have tried to keep us working together as a unit, and i have been actively scumhunting the entire game. plus, i really think the inexperience is telling at this stage of the game. a more experienced player would not have let jam claim jk the way he did. there was something off about that and it makes perfect sense now that chris is confirmed imo. if you have any specific questions let me know, otherwise i think i have been as concise as possible.", "time": "Mon Sep 19, 2011 3:26 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=18683&start=675", "forum": "53", "thread": "18683"}
