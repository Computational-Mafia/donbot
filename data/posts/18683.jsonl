NOTE: Vote count mistakes and be placed in the topic in <span class=\"noboldsig\">bold</span>. Thanks!<br>3) FYI <span style=\"color: #FF8000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">ORANGE</span></span></span> is mine. MINE! <br>4) Anything I say to another player is not to be quoted. <br>5) Players may NEVER PM each other about game related content. This is to ONLY be done in your QT, if you have one, at the appropriate time. <br>6) Small or invisible text is banned. You are not allowed to use coded messages either.<br>7) I will require players to post at least once every 48 hours. This is to keep the game moving. If you go more than 48 hours without posting I will prod you. If you don't post within 48 hours of the prod, you will be replaced. After the 3rd prod, if I have to prod you again I will just replace you instead.<br>8) V/LA's are to be posted in-thread in <span class=\"noboldsig\">BOLD</span>.<br>9) Weekends count as 24 hours<br>10) Days will last 2 Weeks<br>11) Nights will last 2 Days<br>12) To vote, post <span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote:</span> Player. To unvote, post <span class=\"noboldsig\">Unvote</span>. I do not require unvotes, but they are appreciated. Also, using the vote tags are greatly appreciated as well. <br>13) majority=(X Players+1 (If odd number))/2. So if 13 players exist, a majority would be 7.<br>14) Once a majority is reached, votes will not change. Players may continue to talk until I post the death scene.<br>15) If a majority isn't reached by the deadline, no lynch will occur that day.<br>16) Once you're dead, well, you're dead. No further speaking is allowed. No \"Bah!\" posts allowed.<br>17) Remember, this is a game! Play to win and have fun!<br>18) Modkilled players will become Neutral Survivors with a zero chance of winning.<br>19) Don't be stupid. <br>20) These Rules are subject to change.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Sample VT PM</span>:<br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>You are a <span style=\"color: #008000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vanilla Townie</span></span></span>!

Being able to save one of your teammates from death is also satisfying.<br>-VT is definitely one of my top roles. While there are no special powers or anything, you have no fear of getting killed, as you're not exactly vital to the group, but your death will open up new avenues to the town.<br>I'd have to say doc is my favorite role.<br>That's me answering my question, btw.<br>Sorry if most of that sounded stupid, I realize I started to ramble in there somewhere.<br><br>Anyway, looking forward to having a game with you all."}

With the votes piling up the way that they did, and the quickhammer being dropped, I'm inclined to think that Killer will flip town.  Assuming he does, we definitely need to look closer at some of the people on that wagon during the upcoming Night phase, and grill em come Day Two.  Even if he flips scum, I wouldn't be surprised if his scum buddy (buddies?) bussed him, so it would still probably be a good idea to look at the people on the wagon."}

(Go RL) And re-highlights something I found particular peculiar. (Also occurs 2 hrs and 45 mins after post 119)\u2026Surprise.. threads dead.<br><br>So while on paper it sounds dreadful of me.  To be spamming with 5 consecutive posts.  And Being able to say... \"he's overreating!\" sounds convincing.<br><br>But back in reality...what/where am I overreacting?  <br><br>True/false...I simply gave the thread some much needed attention.

Valid excuse based off time in the morning he posted but considering his post 9 hours later that his theory has nothing to do with gaylord and still doesn't offer any insight into his theory his saying he was tired excuse and continuing not to give any theory whatsoever about team sleep being scum not based on a slip is pretty telling to me.  He is avoiding the issue, that is scummy.<br><br>If he still believes sleep should be lynched that is fine but there has been no case made and his actions have been scummy so far this game, thus the summary."}

If you've checked in, you're basically making a promise to the group that you're around, not too busy, and ready to play.  To remain quiet for an extended period afterwards is stretching into lurking territory.  If you've yet to check in/read your pm, this says to me that you are busy elsewhere, and perhaps now don't have time for the game as you would have when you signed up (real life has extraordinary ways to be a bitch like that).  This person will either check in later or get replaced.  I think it's a waste of a vote to vote for someone who has yet to acknowledge their commitment to the game.<br><br>2)  Why self-vote when Sleuth was seeming scummy?  I put my vote where I think the scum are.<br><br>3)  No, I don't see how that pertains to me.  This leads back to point one.  Sleuth had read his pm and responded, thereby making his commitment to the game.  Enough people had added in their two cents (eight total at that point, I believe?) where I felt a little prod was necessary.  And Sleuth's posts afterwards did little to convince me to remove said vote.<br><br>4)  Honestly, gaylord was looking the scummiest on that wagon, given the quickhammer.  Given what we know now, I'm not so sure.<br><br>5)  Much how you didn't like the \"tone\" of my messages, there was something that didn't quite sit right with me.  He disappears for pages at a time, comes in and apologizes for being absent, give a paltry one or two cents worth of his thoughts and then disappears again.  Not active lurking but...ehh, dunno.<br><br>6)  With Ben it came down more to tone of posts.  Not something to base a vote off of, so I didn't do so.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Empking wrote:</cite>Lets massclaim quickly before it breaks the flow.</div></blockquote><br><br>This.  This right here is scummy.  In an open game, sure it would work.  It would also break the game (Saw it happen once.  Some of the games over on Myth-Weavers that I've been a part of have outright forbidden the whole massclaiming thing.  Not that I'm saying I have that big a problem with it).  In a closed set-up, scum can pull some random role out of their ass (or just claim VT if it comes to it) and then they have a good idea of power roles for town.

I don't really see him really taking offence, and instead I read that little bit as 2Birds1Stone looking for someone to pick on as soon as the gate drops.  Dislike.  A few people also pointed at 2B1S' saying the question is a trap, which I glanced right over and missed.  I don't see it being a trap either.  Whatever you like is whatever you like.  It isn't like the Mod gave you a role that he knew you would like.<br><br>---------<br><br>Going to answer the question - I love to play a simple vanilla role-less townie.

His excuse seems BS.<br><br><br>-----<br><br>Captain's question was Mafia experience.  I have been playing Mafia off and on since 2006, with most of it being live or fast games on chat/skype.  I have done a few forum style, but they were few and far between.  I really got back into Mafia again on another site in March, where I have played numerous games of all shapes and sizes.  Their games are by no means fast, but they are certainly faster than Mafia Scum (72 hour Day cycles are the norm).  This is my third game on Mafia scum, with my first two being Newbie games.<br><br><br>-------<br><br><br>Mafia jumps on the Killer vote wagon, but I don't really see his reasoning behind it.  I do see the connection between if Killer flips scum, a gambit with 2b1s.  Hellhound gets on the wagon as well, and his reasoning I agree with, but personally, just because someone is acting newb-tastic, I would not vote for them.<br><br><br><br>Going to pause here because it is late and I can barely keep my eyes open to keep reading."}

I can see why there is a lynch train going on Killer, but my vote would have been on Sleuth at this point.  Killer then puts his vote onto himself... and then his explanation has me scratching my head.  Broski, you were acting scummy.  If you act scummy, you are gonna get votes.  Yes, there probably is Mafia on that train SOMEWHERE, but you were acting scummy.  Stop acting like you weren't.<br><br><br>Gaylord hammers... not really seeing what information could be had.  Sleuth once again is NOT paying attention.  Killer is lynched and.. he was Townie.  WTF.  Bro, you seriously sucked at this.  The lynch happened in... 6 Days?  And half of the people weren't even talking?  Wow.  2B1S killed over night and someone replaces in.  2B1S seemed a little suspicious at first, but tbh, he was not high on my list anymore, and I find it hard to find anything from his death.<br><br><br><br>This concludes Christine's read of Day 1.

That's where my vote would have gone, personally.<br><br>CH Points out the Gaylord bandwagon that James jumped onto and votes for James, thank god someone else notices the wagon.  DJ hops in and asks for the new person's opinion on two of the most random people..... wtf.<br><br>JAM does provide a good reason for jumping on the wagon, but really?  I don't see enough of a reason to vote, just ask questions.<br><br><br>Finally, a voice of reason, Lew, steps in.  <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3353522#p3353522\" class=\"postlink\">Post 114</a>.  I pretty much completely agree with all the points in this post.  Very town read coming from him, or else he is a VERY good scum.<br><br>Benmage then goes on a posting rant, but I don't really get what he is trying to say, except make a defense for himself.  I don't get why, given that there is only one vote on him, and he doesn't even seem to address the issues at hand.  FoS: Benmage.<br><br>Lew pops in again as the voice of reason in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3356626#p3356626\" class=\"postlink\">Post 126</a>, and points out something that deserves a quote:<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>MEMO - if I ever die, go back and check this out: if DJ is scum, ben is not; if ben is scum, DJ is not. </div></blockquote><br><br>Benmage gets all defensive again, followed by DJ, and now I am thinking gambit.  They weren't like this on Day 1, and now I am thinking that they are plotting to have one flip mafia, therefore covering the other.  This has me suspicious of both of them.  BIG FOS there!<br><br><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3361443#p3361443\" class=\"postlink\">Post 141</a> Hellhound appears for the day, and votes Sleuth.  Sleuth hasn't even appeared yet, but he does seem scummy.  However, Hellhound didn't even touch on the other issues.  In next post, Lurc points out the connection between Hellhound and Ben.  Could it really be... a Ben-HH-DJ Mafia team?  Yeah, signs are aiming right at it.  Can't believe no one is screaming it at this point.<br><br>Also, on the note of Metas, I don't really like them, because the VERY good players can act Style A in a game they are town, Style B in a game they are mafia, then Style A in a game they are mafia, and Style B in a game they are town.  I am always wrong when I try to Meta, but I do recognize the value of it.<br><br><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3362309#p3362309\" class=\"postlink\">Post 146</a>, Lew asks for strongest Town Read, and at this point, it is actually him.<br><br>Benmage votes for Gaylord... Another strike against him in my eyes.  Vote for the same guy voting for you with no real reason?<br><br><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3364380#p3364380\" class=\"postlink\">Post 155</a> Benmage... At this point, you need to gain a dictionary and a guide to grammar and punctuation.  Reading your posts is killing my eyes.  Please, for the sake of those that have to read your walls of post that really don't have any meaning, at least write it in a form that is easily readable.<br><br><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3366302#p3366302\" class=\"postlink\">Post 160</a>, Lew gets on team and Gay for possible scum slips.  He votes for Team, and is then asked why he didn't vote for Gay by Ben... Seriously?  Scummy again Ben.  Gay is close to being lynched for other reasons, and the bone that Lew has to pick is with Team mainly.  Pay attention, please.<br><br>Jam in 166 is sitting on the fence.  That seems like either a very inexperienced move, or a mafia move.  Given that my eyes are glaring at the other three, I am going to go with inexperience.<br><br>Mafiafixed IS STILL HERE?! WHERE YA BEEN?  Then votes for Gaylord.  Really.<br><br>Lurc adds pressure to Team, who is... not really answering the questions at hand.  Seems odd to me.  And why did he ignore the question posed by Lew?<br><br>Hellhound seems to want to hide along with those that seem to be more experienced and votes for Team.  That almost just seems like a wagon at this point.<br><br><br>Gaylord reappeares and votes for Team... and then Benmage..... wow.  I gotta quote this one.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3369791#p3369791\" class=\"postlink\">post 183</a>, Benmage wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Gaylord Focker wrote:</cite>While it is evident that teamsleep is NOT mafia <span style=\"font-style: italic\">with us,</span> it is evident that he is, indeed, mafia.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">unvote<br><br>Vote: teamsleep</span></div></blockquote><br>^Is this guy forreal?<br><br>You've done nothing!  You don't explain shit.<br><br>How is TS mafia if not for the connection to you??<br><br>More Gay votes.</div></blockquote><br><br>You haven't explained anything either, sir.<br><br><br>Lew switched to Gay, alright, and then Ben acts scummy again in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3370622#p3370622\" class=\"postlink\">post 198</a>.  DJ points it out, and once again, this is screaming Gambit.  Can't believe Ben is still alive at this point.<br><br><br>And so, Gaylord is lynched with DJ hammering, and Mafiafixed is NK.  That day was so full of WTF.  I cannot believe that NO ONE got onto the Ben-DJ-HH team except for a few minor posts.  They are screaming of scum..."}

For pretty much all of Day 1, Benmage was inactive and wasn't even on the final lynch train. He reappears and says that he came back, and suddenly it was night, and still hadn't caught up on the thread.  At this point, it was only 4 pages, so there was no excuse.  Out of no where, Benmage suddenly goes on a posting spree, talking about a defense for himself, which makes me say WTF.  There was no one really targetting him, minus Gaylord who was currently having a train of lynches run on him, and that is the only vote on him at the time.  His defense doesn't even respond to the attack that Gaylord made, and the entire situation seems odd.<br><br>Lew goes on to point out that DJ and Ben are probably on opposite teams, and Ben freaks out again, going on a posting spree, defending himself... and still doesn't answer the attack, just says that he has to be town.<br><br>Hellhound reappears and discusses some of the talks going on, but completely skips over Ben, as if to avoid attacking a team mate.  Ben then begins to attack some of the other people, saying that they aren't explaining themselves at all, which he is not doing either.  Going into Day 3, Ben has continued to make scummy posts, and out of everyone, he is the one acting the most awkward.  I see \"Best Town Performance\" beside his name, so I expect his scum hunting to be good, but instead of hunting for scum, all he has done this game is defend himself and not even responding to the actual attacks.  <br><br>Ben has acted scummy this whole game, and I will stand beside my vote and my case.  If he flips Town, I will be the first to throw myself or whoever else the masses want into the fire.  But I am telling you, Ben is scum."}

CC and I both felt that Benmage has been scummy since D1.</div></blockquote><br><br>lew and myself did most of the legwork on the benwagon, starting on day 2 i believe? but regardless, chris' only contribution to the benwagon was attempting to tie me to ben. this was only done during the day when ben suspicion was already gaining support, and it dissappeared after the ben flip. but now its back because chris is in the hotseat. bravo.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>chris wrote:</cite>But why would I attack Benmage? The only one of the two confirmed scum that was really getting glared at was Jam. Why not sacrifice the person that was already under suspicion?</div></blockquote><br><br>no. this is false. jam had very little suspicion at that time. plus, jam flipped roleblocker. more valuable than goon. plus, you say \"two confirmed scum\", which again points to the fact that you know we are <span style=\"font-style: italic\">all</span> town.<br><br>671 is another giant AtE.<br><br>cap: not sure how to answer \"why is dj town?\" i think my play speaks for itself. we are here as a direct result of my influence in this game. i have tried to keep us working together as a unit, and i have been actively scumhunting the entire game. plus, i really think the inexperience is telling at this stage of the game. a more experienced player would not have let jam claim jk the way he did. there was something off about that and it makes perfect sense now that chris is confirmed imo. if you have any specific questions let me know, otherwise i think i have been as concise as possible."}
