You may not quote private Moderator-supplied information (either real or fabricated) of any kind. Paraphrasing (for role claims, etc.) is acceptable.<br>\n2. There is to be NO personal communication outside of the forum postings unless your role PM specifically allows it. Mafia members may communicate at night and during the confirmation stage.<br>\n3. If you have a role with a Night action your choices are due to me by the posted deadline. If I do not receive your choice via PM or bolded in the quick-topic provided by the posted deadline you will forfeit your actions.<br>\n4. Roles with Night actions will not be able to submit an action on Night 0 (i.e. during the confirmation stage).<br>\n5. Any player with a Night action may instead submit a &#8220;No Action&#8221; PM to let the Mod know that you do not want to perform your expected action that Night phase.<br>\n6. As a general rule you should aim for one post every 48 hours, minimum, to keep the game moving.<br>\n<br>\nVoting, Deadlines, and Player Death:<br>\n1. A simple majority of all living members must agree on one person for a lynch to occur prior to deadline.<br>\n2. Once you have reached a simple majority no further unvoting will change someone&#8217;s fate.<br>\n3. Once a player is lynched the game enters twilight until I post a death scene; all players including the one who was lynched may continue to post during twilight.<br>\n4. Please submit votes as: Vote: PlayerName or VOTE: PlayerName. Votes will NOT be counted if they are not bold! Obvious abbreviations or nicknames will be counted so long as they are unambiguous.<br>\n5. Please submit vote revocations as either Unvote: PlayerName or Unvote. Unvotes are not necessary before changing votes.<br>\n6. You may Vote: No Lynch - a simple majority of these vote types are required to send the game to Night phase without a lynch.<br>\n7. This game will have 3 week deadlines. At deadline, if there is not a simple majority of votes there will be No Lynch.<br>\n<br>\nMiscellaneous/Mechanics:<br>\n1. Bold, blue text is reserved for the Mod. No invisible/small text is allowed, nor is cryptography.<br>\n2. If you have an issue/problem with the game, please PM the Mod privately. Do not post issues/complaints in the game thread.<br>\n3. The Mod may make mistakes - please point out any mistakes gently. Mistakes will be corrected where possible, but sometimes mistakes are made that cannot be reversed. These will stand as final to be commiserated over after the game.<br>\n4. Please bold all requests to the Mod so that they don&#8217;t get missed.<br>\n5. Prods of missing players will be issued automatically after 72 hours of no activity or upon request after 48 hours of no activity. A prodded player has 48 hours to respond or risks replacement. A player who has been prodded 3 times is subject to replacement without further notice.<br>\n6. Rule violations will be dealt with according to their severity, up to and including a Modkill.<br>\n7. If you anticipate being unavailable for more than a 48-hour period please post a notice to that effect in the thread. Treat this game as a commitment. Be considerate &#8211; don&#8217;t leave us hanging.<br>\n<br>\nHere is the Role PM for a Vanilla Townie, at least one person has received this PM.<br>\n<br>\n[quote]<br>\nYou are a Citizen. You have no special abilities.<br>\n<br>\nYou win if at least one town player is alive when there are no other living living factions.['/quote]", "time": "Tue Aug 28, 2012 9:45 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=23221&start=0", "forum": "53", "thread": "23221"}

Feigning the correct level of outrage is a much harder thing for scum to do than it is for town. Reasoning being, if I accuse scum with dirtbag reasoning, they have to dismiss both the bad reasoning yet good conclusion - a harder thing to do. <br>\n<br>\nI also make no apologies for employing an annoying playstyle. Good town will be able to elicit information while giving enough town reads to others to be eliminated as a suspect. Correct me if I am wrong but I do not believe anybody has actually suggested I am scum, and the call to lynch me comes from Peta's so-called policy lynch above (because we all know that policy lynches are a great idea!).<br>\n<br>\nPeta's policy lynch on me remains juicy. Some valuable information framing, hoping that I will get lynched today and then Peta will be excused tomorrow because of WIFOM doubt. Made sure to chuck all the reasoning in there about how it's okay to lynch a town because they know basically all the scum already. I would contend Peta is not wrong in that respect and knows them all.<br>\n<br>\nI didn't like Peta's urge for the quicklynch. I didn't like the post where my accusation got ad hom'd away and was immediately buddied by DJ (which I reckon probably annoyed Peta a bit). I didn't like it that Peta's read on me after two posts was framed as \"no scumtells\", as opposed to simply null as it felt like trying to avoid a real conflict. Even now when there is a \"1v1\" it's on the basis that I am annoying rather than that one of us is scum. In future, I look forward to being suspicious of Peta unvoting me because I posted more than a paragraph (that being said, now that I pointed that out, I guess the response is more likely to be \"OMFG I hate this guy *keep vote*\".

Justifying his play as bad rather than scum. I find this scummy as, apart from the obvious reason of defence, it seems that Tuxedo essentially ignored the possibility of DJ as scum. As stated before, DJ was not on Tuxedo's list of townreads, but this post reads as though he is already cleared. To put it another way, this post would make sense if Tuxedo had already claimed a town read on DJ.

However it makes perfect sense if DJ and Tuxedo are scum. 50-50 shot of his scumbuddy being lynched, and even if they lynched the townie instead, DJ would be punlic enemy number 1 for D2 lynch. Buddies red into looking for a new wagon. Given that both the red and syn wagons already failed, he would be aware that the mood of this game would allow for wagons to stall.

Derailing that wagon was likely an attempt to seem more town in a game where neither he nor DJ had come under any suspicion at that point. Given the volatility since that point, he thought it was okay to go back to it. He then got called out on going back to the wagon and realised there was no reason to say Syn and not others. So he chucked out a participation excuse and then 4 more names out there (hiding in there DJ, even though he didn't want to vote him just before).<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4306408#p4306408\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4306408#p4306408\" data-post-id=\"4306408\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 431</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=19570\">TuxedoMask</a> wrote:</cite>On one hand, I hate peta's attitude towards the 1v1 because he seems way too sure he isn't gonna be killed tonight.<br>\n<br>\nOn the other, this sort of frustration on day 1 bleeds town to me<br>\n<br>\nOn the rarely used 3rd hand, peta is obvtown and since this is a 1v1 get raped idiot <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: RobertMontata</span></div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nJumping on board the wagon against me as a useful alternative.

Justifying his play as bad rather than scum. I find this scummy as, apart from the obvious reason of defence, it seems that Tuxedo essentially ignored the possibility of DJ as scum. As stated before, DJ was not on Tuxedo's list of townreads, but this post reads as though he is already cleared. To put it another way, this post would make sense if Tuxedo had already claimed a town read on DJ.

Derailing that wagon was likely an attempt to seem more town in a game where neither he nor DJ had come under any suspicion at that point. Given the volatility since that point, he thought it was okay to go back to it. He then got called out on going back to the wagon and realised there was no reason to say Syn and not others. So he chucked out a participation excuse and then 4 more names out there (hiding in there DJ, even though he didn't want to vote him just before).<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4306408#p4306408\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4306408#p4306408\" data-post-id=\"4306408\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 431</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=19570\">TuxedoMask</a> wrote:</cite>On one hand, I hate peta's attitude towards the 1v1 because he seems way too sure he isn't gonna be killed tonight.<br>\n<br>\nOn the other, this sort of frustration on day 1 bleeds town to me<br>\n<br>\nOn the rarely used 3rd hand, peta is obvtown and since this is a 1v1 get raped idiot <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: RobertMontata</span></div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nJumping on board the wagon against me as a useful alternative.

W/r/t the first two, I think they do much to push a case on deadjoker well before his lynch seemed like an inevitability or even a very strong consideration. I also have a hard time seeing the way deadjoker addresses them both (in posts 317, 393, and 395) as him talking to his partner(s).

But that seems to be more her playstyle/personality than anything.<br>\n<br>\nSyn/Coron seemed to be one place deadjoker was willing to throw down a vote, and though the logic behind his fos seemed thin, the way he hopped onto this wagon while it seemed juicy made me think this wasn't a distancing attempt for some reason. Seemed to me like he was trying to waste the ML here rather than bus/distance his partner. Looking at their posts individually, though, doesn't inspire me with confidence one way or the other. Something about the conclusions Coron arrives at rubs me the wrong way but his reasoning strikes me as possibly coming from a genuine town thought process (yes, I'm fence sitting on you, dwi).<br>\n<br>\nThe way deadjoker addressed petapan during twilight also doesn't strike me as scum addressing his partner...but he was confirmed scum, so I'd pretty much take anything he said here with a huge grain of salt.<br>\n<br>\nI'm exhausted/tired so sorry if any of this came out in a contrived way or if I missed anything.

Justifying his play as bad rather than scum. I find this scummy as, apart from the obvious reason of defence, it seems that Tuxedo essentially ignored the possibility of DJ as scum. As stated before, DJ was not on Tuxedo's list of townreads, but this post reads as though he is already cleared. To put it another way, this post would make sense if Tuxedo had already claimed a town read on DJ. Given that he flat ignored him earlier, it is strange that there is no equivocation.\"<br>\n<br>\ni was actually defending redtail more than deadjoker since everyone was insisting they were a team, you have zero reading comprehension and are really fucking reaching, especially seeing as i ended that post with \"this is not an alignment tell\"<br>\n<br>\n\"<br>\nTries to dissipate the power of the 1v1 between Red and DJ. I think this would point away from all 3 of them being scum. However it makes perfect sense if DJ and Tuxedo are scum. 50-50 shot of his scumbuddy being lynched, and even if they lynched the townie instead, DJ would be punlic enemy number 1 for D2 lynch. Buddies red into looking for a new wagon. Given that both the red and syn wagons already failed, he would be aware that the mood of this game would allow for wagons to stall. He needed a new target..<br>\n\"<br>\ni explained why i wanted to do this, with all the teambuilding i thought lynching outside of the perceived \"partners\" that didn't actually exist was best for town because a deadjoker lynch would result in a redtail autolynch d2 from the way people were talking, but yeah go ahead and say i was trying to flip the wagon to someone else <br>\n<br>\n\"<br>\nSo in the first post, Tuxedo goes back to the syn wagon, which he himself derailed. Derailing that wagon was likely an attempt to seem more town in a game where neither he nor DJ had come under any suspicion at that point. Given the volatility since that point, he thought it was okay to go back to it. He then got called out on going back to the wagon and realised there was no reason to say Syn and not others. So he chucked out a participation excuse and then 4 more names out there (hiding in there DJ, even though he didn't want to vote him just before).\"<br>\n<br>\ncalled out for WHAT? i gave my perfectly valid reasons for unvoting syn and i never once un-fosed him<br>\n<br>\n\"<br>\nJumping on board the wagon against me as a useful alternative. Tried to justify why it was a good idea to participate in the 1v1 but got tied up I think, especially when you contrast it with his desire to \"lynch away\" from the red v DJ 1v1.\"<br>\n<br>\nlmfao<br>\n<br>\n\"<br>\nThis post is fucking retarded. He typed up a response but then deleted it. What townie would do that? I don't write stuff up and then delete it, simply because at the very worst, it will be a bad call. The only reason you delete what you write is because you are afraid of giving away tells against you, meaning scum.

This is my first game here. It seems a weird combination.\"<br>\n<br>\nI felt like this line regarding his ignorance of setup mechanics here felt really genuine and really helped explain why he avoided comment on the redtail wagon (which is something I found scummy initially). This was further reinforced in the following post where he explains how he's new to the site and his prior mafia experience, all of which I find really unlikely to be faked.<br>\n<br>\n\"The initial reason for your vote was your posts around page 3 or 4 I think where you pushed redtail, plus general attitude. I get the intimidating thing as a strategy either way but it's definitely something I'd challenge. Call it tunnelling or confirmation bias but I have taken things you have said in reaction to my accusation to also be scummy. If you are looking for an apology, I am afraid it is not forthcoming, because I feel regardless that it has elucidated a lot, not only about yourself but particularly, about others have reacted. Hence my suspicion of the Tux among others.\"<br>\n<br>\nHis explanation of why he targetted petapan for reactions here also feels like it comes from a genuine desire to fish for reactions. I think the line about challenging intimidation tactics seems far more likely to come from genuine conviction rather than scum trying to disrupt or muddy the waters.<br>\n<br>\n\"I think DJ is scum and is unsure about being on my wagon because of all the suspicion that has already been heaped on him. Ain't going to work champ. I am also very wary of Tuxedo as I alluded to before given that he is claims \"hard town reads\" on people without evidence, and then when pressed for it, admits they did say a few scummy things. Whether he is buddying townpeta or protecting scumpeta, I don't like it. Also that new guy who made the big post about dumb accusations and about how policy lynches suck but then proceeded to vote me deserves another look.\"<br>\n<br>\nNot much to say here but I also think his read on deadjoker and Tuxedo here own fairly hard.

He refers to scumTuxedo briefly but then throws the red herring with a ridiculous idea tha maybe Sach slipped by saying 'the town'. Distraction. He then calls Deadjoker town but covers himself by saying another post destroys the town read. Note he does not go beyond null read. He tried to get a bit of traction on the petapan thing too but that didn't take off. Plus of course, the fact that he jumped on board for the policy lynch even when he said that was dumb. <br>\n<br>\nAnyway, having read through the entire topic again, Baldanders is far and away the logical choice for final scum. I don't get much from Redtail except for an unusual meta-setup tell. The interactions with deadjoker and Tuxedomask also make a redtailscum seem less likely given how they interacted with each other.<br>\n<br>\nIn any case:<br>\n<br>\n1.
