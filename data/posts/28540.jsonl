Well, it used to be the most populated city, anyway. This place has cleared out since people started dying. Before she scrammed, the city's mayor elected fourteen citizens to discover who is destroying our city from within. Unfortunately, I've discovered that not all of the members of our council are working towards this goal. We've been infiltrated by the very people we're trying to find. But it's not all bad!

Site-wide rules apply.<br>\n2. Play to your win condition.<br>\n3. Do not quote any information given by the mod. Paraphrasing is okay.<br>\n4. No cryptography or hidden text. If the text cannot be seen by the mod without quoting or copy-pasting your post, then you've broken this rule.<br>\n5. Do not use my color (#3CB371).<br>\n6. Don't be an asshole. Attacking a person's argument or post is fine. Attacking someone personally is not. Keep it civil. If you are seriously offended by something any player says during this game, then please PM me.<br>\n7. If you believe a mod error has been made, please PM me immediately. I prefer if you do not announce or discuss it in-game until I have confirmed that a mod error has occurred.<br>\n8. Once you are dead, you are permitted to make a single \"Bah\" post. Do not include any player names or anything related to the game in your post. If you're posting something that could influence the result of the game, you're doing it wrong.<br>\n9. Do not argue with the mod in thread. Feel free to PM me if you have any issues with any actions I've taken. I will happily listen to and seriously consider any comments or complaints - just not in the game thread.<br>\n10. Do not play against the spirit of the rules or of the game. This is intentionally a catch-all rule. I will always warn someone in-thread before any action is taken against them if I'm applying this rule.<br>\n11. This ruleset is subject to change at any time. If a change is made mid-game, it will be announced in-thread by the mod.<br>\n<br>\nVoting Rules:<br>\n<br>\n1. Votes should be made using bolded text (Vote: Player) or a vote tag (<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Player</span>). Unvotes are not required but highly appreciated.<br>\n2. If I can understand the vote, then it will count even if it doesn't follow the exact format listed above.<br>\n3. You may vote for a No Lynch in the same manner as you vote for a player.<br>\n4. A lynch (or no lynch) occurs when a simple majority is reached. A simple majority is half of the alive players rounded down plus one.<br>\n5. During twilight (the time between when the hammer vote is cast and I lock the thread), all players including the lynchee may continue to post.<br>\n<br>\nActivity Rules:<br>\n<br>\n1. A prod PM will be issued if any player does not post for 72 hours. Prods will be announced in-thread. You have 24 hours to pick up your prod either by posting or PM (if at night). After this time, I will begin seeking a replacement.<br>\n2. I will seek replacement immediately without waiting 24 hours if a player receives a third prod.<br>\n3. If you plan to be gone for over 48 hours, please announce that you will be V/LA in-thread. I will not count you as V/LA unless you post this in-thread. This is for the benefit of both myself and your fellow players. I will note all V/LA players in each vote count.<br>\n<br>\nDeadline Rules:<br>\n<br>\n1. The first day has a deadline of 21 days. Each subsequent day has a deadline of 14 days.<br>\n2. Automatic extensions are granted when a replacement replaces into the game with less than a week left in the day if necessary.The exact amount of time will be between 24 hours and 72 hours and will be determined by the moderator.<br>\n3. If the day deadline is reached without any majority vote, then a no lynch will occur. The day will never end by deadline while a replacement is being sought out.<br>\n4. Each night will end after 48 hours and no sooner. For the purposes of the night deadline, the weekend counts as 24 hours. The countdown for a night deadline will not start while a replacement is being sought out.<br>\n5. All night actions must be submitted by PM or a relevant QT. I greatly prefer PM.<br>\n6. Players on V/LA will receive a PM at the start of night. Any players that anticipate being unavailable over the entire night may submit actions early.<br>\n<br>\nSample Role PM:</div></div><br>\n<br>\n<fieldset style=\"border:3px outset grey;padding:5px 10px\">Welcome to Mini 1454!<br>\n<br>\nYou are a <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:green\">Vanilla Townie</div></div>.<br>\n<br>\nYour only abilities are your voice and your vote.<br>\n<br>\nYou win when all threats to the town are eliminated and at least one town member survives.<br>\n<br>\nThe game thread can be found here: <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=28540\" class=\"postlink\">http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=28540</a><br>\n<br>\nPlease confirm by PM.

I do find it fascinating that he actually cared enough to go through the archives on fuzzy's stats, though. To me, that either means that he's a scared townie(face it, we've all been there) or playing one of the poorest scum performances I have ever seen.<br>\n<br>\n--I hate people who act like fuzzy, while it does serve it's role of getting the ball rolling in a game, it's kind of destructive to one's own self-preservation and ends in getting oneself lynched more often than not. That said, from my own personal experience, this puts him in either the role of a scum or townie--I highly doubt a power role would draw such to his self. In a case like this, I do not support a lynch on fuzzy simply because the role of \"the instigator\" is an important one, and I would like to see his play after a night before drawing conclusions.<br>\n<br>\n--I'm not sure I have anything to say on notscience besides my natural disposition to hate ponies. Same goes for JuanJuan. Neither has stoked my scum sensors, but neither has come off as inherently town.<br>\n<br>\n--Everyone else has been a voice of reason, as should be obvious.

Anyways, as for the current wagons, I feel extremely hesitant to jump on the Amrun train, despite being mildly skeptical of her--I don't feel particularly confident on the three people really voting for her. <br>\n<br>\nJKMatthews--Okay, I see both sides of the argument. Bubba did a lot of the legwork in post 258 on the town-argument, but the others have rightfully pointed out an amount of philophosizing and shallowness. In addition, the people I am more likely to trust are against him, so there is that. Being said, I am not ready to commit to a JKM wagon just yet.<br>\n<br>\nWhich leads me to notscience. After re-reading notscience's vote history &amp; posts since the point Hoopla pointed out, I am more and more liking this wagon. His three votes--Amrun, fuzzy, and I--have always been after someone else voted on them, but not only that, but someone who got some bad PR directly before his votes. I'm unsure if he's just being reactionary or not(it's possible), but I'm more willing to believe he's trying to push a wagon early in an attempt to get the tempo ball rolling in all cases. Ergo, I am willing to put down the ultimatum of a <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: notscience</span>.</div></blockquote>\n\nOh, so my votes are always after someone else? Last I checked, you followed me onto pitoli and held onto it for holy hell. Show me where you HAVENT done that. Not to mention, my vote on you had a reason. I shared the reason. What wagon am I currently trying to push, please enlighten me as to that fact? I'm voting those that I find to be scum. Also people are REACTIONARY in mafia? The game where everything is judged by-wait for it- REACTIONS? Say it isn't so. I'd wager the only reason you're liking my wagon is an attempt to save your scumbuddies from a lynch. Namely, JKMatthews, whom you \"aren't ready\" to pursue a lynch on for someodd reason. Why not? He's done NOTHING to help the town. You're just looking at the wagons and saying \"well, this is the biggest so I will jump on and town will like me for it because I follow the majority!\" I don't like the vote (for obvious reasons, as well as what I've listed here) and it comes off to me slightly OMGUSy for my calling you out a few pages ago.</div></blockquote>\nWho do you think HP's scumbuddies, then?<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4984492#p4984492\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4984492#p4984492\" data-post-id=\"4984492\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 287</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=20746\">JKMatthews</a> wrote:</cite>So university has gone back for me today, meaning what little free time I had is even smaller.<br>\nMy 'philosophising' and vagueness are completely fair accusations - I always forget the amount of time that needs to be dedicated to a game increases exponentially with the number of players, and I fear I really can't keep up with this game. <br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Mod, could I please be replaced?</div><br>\n<br>\nI hope this doesn't disrupt the game too much.

Even that one sentence on him is lacking. If notscience flips town, jon_h61 needs to come under fire for sitting on notscience all day without even attempting to figure out his alignment. Conversely, if notscience is scum, jon is probably town. Scum don't needlessly sit on a random vote all day on their buddy. But it is suspicious if notscience is town.<br>\n<br>\n2) <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">NobodySpecial</div> has done absolutely nothing all game, and like jon, is sitting on an ancient vote on notscience without doing anything at all to determine his alignment. Unfortunately NobodySpecial tends to lurk and be lazy as town as often as he does scum, so as much as I'm willing to call him out for his vote, I don't expect it to be alignment telling for him. <br>\n<br>\n3) <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">JuanJuan</div>, like the other two before him is still sitting on an ancient vote from page 3 based on spurious reasoning. And like the two before him has done little to analyse his vote, other players or interrogate notscience. Suspicious.<br>\n<br>\nThis is the foundation of the notscience wagon: laziness and apathy. Not one of these voters have displayed any curiosity at all regarding notscience's alignment and have pretty much just nestled in for the ride and done nothing else. I would be gobsmacked if all three of these players are town - if they are, we're fucked, because it means our lynches are being determined almost randomly. None of these voters have any idea why they're voting notscience - all they've done is enabled other people to jump on thinking it's a viable wagon, when in reality, it is based on nothing.<br>\n<br>\nThis is highly suspicious, and I expect scum to be in the first three voters, or if not, the ones to come, because why wouldn't scum capitalise on such an easy mislynch?<br>\n<br>\nOkay, looking at the rest of these votes:<br>\n<br>\n4) <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">AngelInFreezer's</div> play hasn't been horrible and has shopped his vote around to other places before settling on notscience, so I don't have too much issue with his occupation of the notscience wagon. I still have him as null.<br>\n<br>\n5) <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">JKMatthew's</div> vote actually isn't as horrible as I was remembering. He didn't have any votes on him at the time, and yet he decided to place an L-2 vote on notscience, when HookerPunch was also on four votes. That's an action towards furthering the game, and is only suspicious if HookerPunch is scum with JKMatthews - a distinct possibility, but if both notscience and HookerPunch are town, then it makes JKMatthew's play positive. Not necessarily town, but it isn't suspicious to me.<br>\n<br>\n6) <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">HookerPunch</div>. I don't know how I feel about his initial L-1 vote on notscience. It makes sense if Amrun or HookerPunch is scum, as they could easily become the lynch target if the notscience wagon collapsed, but it still is pretty brazen. Reading through his iso, he seems very fencesitty and my gut says scum, but I don't really know why. It looks like he's avoiding committing to any serious stances, which is in contrast to his L-1 vote. Weird. I don't know why Amrun has him as town, but I'd like to know.<br>\n<br>\n~~<br>\n<br>\nI definitely have a lot more issues with the base of this wagon than those who joined late. As I said before, the fact that all my town reads are off this wagon, and I see six null-to-scummy voters on it, makes it really obvious to me that this is a mislynch with at least two scum sitting comfortably on votes they haven't been challenged on. <br>\n<br>\nI want to lynch someone on this wagon, and it should be one of the early voters, in my opinion. I am still suspicious of JKMatthews, and I think he needs to be die at some point, but I think I've unearthed higher priorities here.<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: </span><br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: JuanJuan</span>", "time": "Sun May 26, 2013 6:55 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=28540&start=300", "forum": "53", "thread": "28540"}

None of these voters have any idea why they're voting notscience - all they've done is enabled other people to jump on thinking it's a viable wagon, when in reality, it is based on nothing.<br>\n<br>\nThis is highly suspicious, and I expect scum to be in the first three voters, or if not, the ones to come, because why wouldn't scum capitalise on such an easy mislynch?<br>\n<br>\nOkay, looking at the rest of these votes:<br>\n<br>\n-snip-<br>\n~~<br>\n<br>\nI definitely have a lot more issues with the base of this wagon than those who joined late.

Notscience called jon out for buddying, but jon seems too intelligent to buddy so purposefully.  Real buddying looks a lot like what AJ is doing instead.  I didn't want to say anything until my gut actually had some substance because the minute I call it out, the minute the behavior changes.  But Hoopla came in and began a tertiary suspicion of AJ, and we saw his behavior depart from his previous behavior fairly drastically.  To me, this confirms that he's conscious of what he's doing and this makes him extremely scummy in my eyes.  So scummy, in fact...<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: AJ</span><br>\n<br>\nI also wanted to note for Hoopla that even though I was off the notscience wagon, if I were to have moved my vote from JKMatthews, it would have been to notscience at that point.  I was conflicted there, but notscience is scummy in a very obvious way, so obvious in fact that I was wondering if this was a reason he was maybe town as opposed to scum.  I noted this somewhere a while back, probably in slightly different words.  That being said, your analysis makes sense -- but I don't think it's quite as conclusive as you seem to, one of the reasons being that AJ makes very good sense as a not science buddy.<br>\n<br>\nJK's replace out could be null, but a slot that just begins to get pressure and bails for such a vague reason always ticks my notch as scum.

Have you ever played with NS before?<br>\n<br>\nI want to say one thing, though.  NS said that about being more emotionally invested in the game as scum because it's true for HIM.  He is more emotionally invested in his scum games.  And I see him as NOT emotionally invested in this game, and viewing things through the lense of how he does things, which is fairly townish.  Plus, most bits of content he HAS posted I have basically agreed with, and only the last one about JKMathews had a real potential to be non genuine.  That's why I read him as town.<br>\n<br>\nBut I don't like this post from marc at all.

By post 253, this is his only scum read, yet he's had no interaction with Notscience at all.<br>\n<br>\nAll of his posts have a high noise to content ratio. In 253, almost all his reads are town but one. His nulls are \"I can't read this person\". Jon's being non-confrontational, trying to stay away from any arguments by any means necessary. He picked one wagon on the newest player and doesn't try to scum hunt at all. Finds no one better to vote for. He unvotes in 334 for no apparent reason (It's actually from my post where I say I could catch scum on Not's wagon after a flip. He was pressured out).<br>\n<br>\nAfter saying JuanX2 sounded 'scared after a few votes', he makes it look like he's going to vote Jaun. But instead votes notscience because someone told him to. See the non-aggression, non-confrontation stance he has? Jon literally wants to stick away from ALL the action. In 386, he claims his 'scum read<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">s</div>' are attacking him. I still don't see a second read. <br>\n<br>\nAnd most important to me: Every time he looks at me, he brings up meta of one game. A game were I had almost no participation because I was coaching my mason buddy and hoping to keep a mason intact until Lylo. My actual meta could be read, but Jon thinks that he's got one game for a know-all end-all on my meta.

None of these voters have any idea why they're voting notscience - all they've done is enabled other people to jump on thinking it's a viable wagon, when in reality, it is based on nothing.<br>\n<br>\nThis is highly suspicious, and I expect scum to be in the first three voters, or if not, the ones to come, because why wouldn't scum capitalise on such an easy mislynch?<br>\n<br>\nOkay, looking at the rest of these votes:<br>\n<br>\n4) <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">AngelInFreezer's</div> play hasn't been horrible and has shopped his vote around to other places before settling on notscience, so I don't have too much issue with his occupation of the notscience wagon. I still have him as null.<br>\n<br>\n5) <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">JKMatthew's</div> vote actually isn't as horrible as I was remembering. He didn't have any votes on him at the time, and yet he decided to place an L-2 vote on notscience, when HookerPunch was also on four votes. That's an action towards furthering the game, and is only suspicious if HookerPunch is scum with JKMatthews - a distinct possibility, but if both notscience and HookerPunch are town, then it makes JKMatthew's play positive. Not necessarily town, but it isn't suspicious to me.<br>\n<br>\n6) <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">HookerPunch</div>. I don't know how I feel about his initial L-1 vote on notscience. It makes sense if Amrun or HookerPunch is scum, as they could easily become the lynch target if the notscience wagon collapsed, but it still is pretty brazen. Reading through his iso, he seems very fencesitty and my gut says scum, but I don't really know why. It looks like he's avoiding committing to any serious stances, which is in contrast to his L-1 vote. Weird. I don't know why Amrun has him as town, but I'd like to know.<br>\n<br>\n~~<br>\n<br>\nI definitely have a lot more issues with the base of this wagon than those who joined late. As I said before, the fact that all my town reads are off this wagon, and I see six null-to-scummy voters on it, makes it really obvious to me that this is a mislynch with at least two scum sitting comfortably on votes they haven't been challenged on. <br>\n<br>\nI want to lynch someone on this wagon, and it should be one of the early voters, in my opinion. I am still suspicious of JKMatthews, and I think he needs to be die at some point, but I think I've unearthed higher priorities here.<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: </span><br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: JuanJuan</span></div></blockquote></div></div></div>", "time": "Wed May 29, 2013 6:32 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=28540&start=400", "forum": "53", "thread": "28540"}

I've tried to stay ambivalent to the whole affair, because I do get both scum vibes and town vibes from him, but I kinda got bored for a moment and forgot the bigger picture. His defensiveness to me doesn't paint him favorably in my eyes(not necessarily because he is FoS'ing me, day ones are dumb and people really have no idea), but it did, combined with my immediate regret, give him enough benefit of the doubt to allow me to reprieve him for a while.<br>\n<br>\nI do admit, from JKM's posts, he seems to share similar sentiment as me in regards to day ones, but on reading his posts in isolation, he truly hasn't contributed much, I cannot deny. Much less than notscience at least.<br>\n<br>\nYou know who has commit less though? Marcmann, but at least he brought up hypocrisy at one point. <br>\n<br>\nYou wanna know who has contributed absolutely nothing? Nobody Special--seriously, go read his posts. Of the six, three don't matter than the other three have very little content.<br>\n<br>\nTangentially, fuzzy's continued obtuseness bothers me. Like, I actually am coming around to the idea that a policy lynch might not have been the worst idea we could have done today.</div></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4989211#p4989211\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4989211#p4989211\" data-post-id=\"4989211\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 373</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=21260\">bubbajack8</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4988370#p4988370\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4988370#p4988370\" data-post-id=\"4988370\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 356</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=21601\">HookerPunch</a> wrote:</cite>Hey, marcmann, a post I can actually get behind. <br>\n<br>\n@bubba: <blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div> <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">adding this, but it's a part of the quote. \"I don't feel like quoting Hp's 318 so I'll answer it by paragraph. </div><br>\n<br>\n1.

Bubba did a lot of the legwork in post 258 on the town-argument, but the others have rightfully pointed out an amount of philophosizing and shallowness. In addition, the people I am more likely to trust are against him, so there is that. Being said, I am not ready to commit to a JKM wagon just yet.<br>\n<br>\nWhich leads me to notscience. After re-reading notscience's vote history &amp; posts since the point Hoopla pointed out, I am more and more liking this wagon. His three votes--Amrun, fuzzy, and I--have always been after someone else voted on them, but not only that, but someone who got some bad PR directly before his votes. I'm unsure if he's just being reactionary or not(it's possible), but I'm more willing to believe he's trying to push a wagon early in an attempt to get the tempo ball rolling in all cases.

Because it's basically saying \"They are stupid don't listen to them\" <br>\n<br>\nI'm pro at mafia. And mafia is a numbers game. There's a 2/13 chance that one of you or HP is scum. Well I guess 2/12 (since I'm not) making it 1/6. Plus there's a probable scum between HP and Not making a 1/10 (or so) chance greater then you that he is scum. It is a numbers game. <br>\n<br>\nI'm 100% certain there's a scum between you and HP. And if I was mafia, you would follow that because \"scum busses D1\".

I understand being bored and wanting the day to end(hell, I am bored and want this day to end), but giving the chance for scum to hop on a train for free is stupid.<br>\n<br>\nI am reminded of JKM's very timely replace out the second he's under pressure. When I'm not on my phone, I should reread kthxbai's posts, perhaps they will redeem him, but until that point, <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: kthxbai</span>.<br>\n<br>\nPS goddamn, I wish the more reasonable voices were here.</div></blockquote>\n\nThis post is bad. The idea that Bubba has been on anyone this whole game is simply out of touch. Thinking that Kthx is 'bloodthirsty' is just mudslinging. Then bringing up JKM's replace as a whole case (by the way, we've covered this shit: I think it's somewhat bad, but not inherently scum. Outside factors should not influence terribly) is worse. This, coupled by the fact that I grow less fond of my current vote makes me want to put you safely at L-1. <br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: HP</span><br>\n<br>\nAh, I'll give Jon another chance.

That doesn't mean he makes plays like hammering an unclaimed person with plenty of time till deadline either.  This isn't a noobie game and he isn't a noobie.

We lose four town players, even if two be our choice, and we're effectively down to all the mild-null reads this game since no one has developed a ton of town reads. Obviously, Hoopla was town. That was one of the four I had as town and unfortunately, mislynching means we're just losing another confirmed town and gaining nothing. This wagon is also coming on too easily. He's either getting bussed or we're dealing with a bunch of scum letting this wagon roll on through no questions asked. <br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5007528#p5007528\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5007528#p5007528\" data-post-id=\"5007528\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 594</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=21211\">marcmann2</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5006755#p5006755\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5006755#p5006755\" data-post-id=\"5006755\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 586</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=20197\">Aj The Epic</a> wrote:</cite>I mean, I don't mind an NS lynch, but I feel he's more anti-town by nature, not scum.

Especially the A and B contradiction. Amrun was DISCUSSING the vote earlier in the thread. (Post 38). Now, let's talk about this KBW tell I am working on. (It's a definite truth, fyi, I just need it to catch on).<br>\n<br>\nAmrun has attacked Bubba mainly for inexperience/newness, even if she says she hadn't. As stated in many of these posts, she thinks this is a legitimate reason to lynch, apparently. One of the funniest posts in this thread is where she attacked Notscience for advocating a policy lynch, even though notscience probably has never heard of it and Amrun's reasoning is policy lynching. <br>\n<br>\nNow, why is this scummy? Because the correct play by 'experienced town' is if you think a player is that bad, get a replacement. Notice, though, how Amrun never questions Fuzzy for it, though his play is perhaps worse than Bubba's. This is what really strikes me as weird: You might lynch scum if you knew Bubba was scum, but he was reading frustrated townie, and after this post, very much town. You don't advocate policy lynches on slots that are town and can just replace out. You're also supposed to be unbiased with this approach, which means Fuzzy should've been under the same pressure. As with Notscience, but I think that comes later. <br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4973531#p4973531\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4973531#p4973531\" data-post-id=\"4973531\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 80</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=15143\">Amrun</a> wrote:</cite>Bubba, scum can be incompetent too.

No.  And I didn't realize I was signing up for this.<br>\n<br>\nGo on pretending \"I'm not contributing\" when I'm one of the very few people actually doing anything in this game and posting and doing shit.  (You're another, so thanks for that.)<br>\n<br>\nI'm so frustrated with this game.  I don't know how to play with people that VOTING IS SCUMMY and don't know what RVS is but are ALSO too arrogant to understand that they are relatively inexperienced.  One or two is different, but when it's literally everyone that's like...  what the hell.  That's why there are SEs and ICs in newbie games.

Especially the A and B contradiction. Amrun was DISCUSSING the vote earlier in the thread. (Post 38). Now, let's talk about this KBW tell I am working on. (It's a definite truth, fyi, I just need it to catch on).<br>\n<br>\nAmrun has attacked Bubba mainly for inexperience/newness, even if she says she hadn't. As stated in many of these posts, she thinks this is a legitimate reason to lynch, apparently. One of the funniest posts in this thread is where she attacked Notscience for advocating a policy lynch, even though notscience probably has never heard of it and Amrun's reasoning is policy lynching. <br>\n<br>\nNow, why is this scummy? Because the correct play by 'experienced town' is if you think a player is that bad, get a replacement. Notice, though, how Amrun never questions Fuzzy for it, though his play is perhaps worse than Bubba's. This is what really strikes me as weird: You might lynch scum if you knew Bubba was scum, but he was reading frustrated townie, and after this post, very much town. You don't advocate policy lynches on slots that are town and can just replace out. You're also supposed to be unbiased with this approach, which means Fuzzy should've been under the same pressure. As with Notscience, but I think that comes later. <br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4973531#p4973531\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4973531#p4973531\" data-post-id=\"4973531\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 80</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=15143\">Amrun</a> wrote:</cite>Bubba, scum can be incompetent too.

That being said, notscience saying that is a fairly strong town tell when nk speculation looks good for him.<br>\n<br>\nBubba, I don't KNOW why Hoopla was killed.  I'm speculating, and Juan being behind it is another possibility I have raised.<br>\n<br>\nBut this is why I think it is most likely to be AJ: before Hoopla (and then me) began suspecting him, AJ buddies us fairly hard (me more so, as I was in the game longer).  I noted it since the beginning but I wanted to let it ride.  He voted JK after me and Hoopla, with no reasoning, for example -- boom boom boom, 1, 2, 3.  And tried to include himself in the more experienced group with phrasing and vote patterns, even though I certainly wasn't mentally including him and don't believe I've ever played with him before.  Even though NS is just as experienced as me (or more), he never exhibited this behavior towards NS.<br>\n<br>\nAnd then when Hoopla expresses suspicion of AJ, his behavior in game changed.  And then when I dropped the above information, which his behavior change confirming it for me, and voted AJ, his behavior continued to shift and he moved from \"buddy\" mode to \"defense\" mode.<br>\n<br>\nIt's quite clear that Hoopla and I were his biggest threats simply by virtue of suspecting him and being the most likely to be able to achieve a lynch from that.  I suspected him more, but not only is Hoopla a better player than me and more experienced, she was fairly universally town read while I have had people annoyed with me and am much more likely to be lynched.<br>\n<br>\nAnd he starts out of the gate today voting me.  Surprise, right?  Not at all.<br>\n<br>\nNk analysis has fallen out of favor here, because people dismiss it for wifom or don't mention it at all.  This has led to an uptick of scum just blatantly killing their threats.  (I was just talking to Dgb about this at the scum meet, and she said as scum she just completely slaughters anyone who might vote for her, both at night and with votes, because everyone assumes its \"too obvious\" and doesn't look for it anymore.)<br>\n<br>\nBut even so, Hoopla ISN'T the obvious kill.

Especially the A and B contradiction. Amrun was DISCUSSING the vote earlier in the thread. (Post 38). Now, let's talk about this KBW tell I am working on. (It's a definite truth, fyi, I just need it to catch on).<br>\n<br>\nAmrun has attacked Bubba mainly for inexperience/newness, even if she says she hadn't. As stated in many of these posts, she thinks this is a legitimate reason to lynch, apparently. One of the funniest posts in this thread is where she attacked Notscience for advocating a policy lynch, even though notscience probably has never heard of it and Amrun's reasoning is policy lynching. <br>\n<br>\nNow, why is this scummy? Because the correct play by 'experienced town' is if you think a player is that bad, get a replacement. Notice, though, how Amrun never questions Fuzzy for it, though his play is perhaps worse than Bubba's. This is what really strikes me as weird: You might lynch scum if you knew Bubba was scum, but he was reading frustrated townie, and after this post, very much town. You don't advocate policy lynches on slots that are town and can just replace out. You're also supposed to be unbiased with this approach, which means Fuzzy should've been under the same pressure. As with Notscience, but I think that comes later. <br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4973531#p4973531\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4973531#p4973531\" data-post-id=\"4973531\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 80</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=15143\">Amrun</a> wrote:</cite>Bubba, scum can be incompetent too.

Notscience called jon out for buddying, but jon seems too intelligent to buddy so purposefully.  Real buddying looks a lot like what AJ is doing instead.  I didn't want to say anything until my gut actually had some substance because the minute I call it out, the minute the behavior changes.  But Hoopla came in and began a tertiary suspicion of AJ, and we saw his behavior depart from his previous behavior fairly drastically.  To me, this confirms that he's conscious of what he's doing and this makes him extremely scummy in my eyes.  So scummy, in fact...</div></blockquote>\n\n<br>\nWhat bandwagon. You went Juan, I said Jon is the right choice. If you think I'm changing my behavior, I'm not. Notscience is an easy target for newness. I can pick bad scum off of that wagon all day. I don't believe Not to be scum, but I've never gone out of my way to impair the wagon. <br>\n<br>\nAlso, no offense but I wouldn't buddy you or Hoopla. I believe you to be town, but your reads are well different from mine if you think Jaun is scum. The fact that you laid out a better case for Jon and went Juan constantly bothers me. And then to simply cop out that Notscience is being scummy? Come on, for an experienced player, you should at least be able to analyze that this is probably Not's third game. Also, he has been the target of bad votes and bad cases. Using any knowledge, I can tell you that slot is mislynch fodder, but you still accept it as scum. This is another reason I'd never buddy with you: You're completely missing mislynch fodder and mistaking it for scum. You even said it's your second vote choice. The popular vote route keeps you high and dry, right? That's fine, but it's not the correct path. <br>\n<br>\nNot doesn't flip scum. No chance of it. The wagon's composition has forever been too awful, from Jon's RVS vote all the way down to Kthx claiming a dueling wagon where he was right and i was the buddy.

That should work itself out shortly though and before Lylo/Mylo as if GIF is alive past tonight, the remaining scum is taking a HUUUUUGE risk in hoping he doesn't target them or GIF is in fact scum who played a very ballsy gambit.  I digress.  First things first today.  Join the logic wagon folks and see where we end up.

So if A submits the kill and a town tracker targets B, B appears to have done nothing yet he's still scum and there was still a kill because A was the person who killed.

If he claimed even-night to avoid the N3 nightkill, but scum roleblocked him anyway, then he should know that scum don't necessarily believe him and shouldn't be so hesitant to claim when someone heavily hinting at a PR wants to know what his role is.

Kthx is an inno, GiF has bussed not, your reports match up with your posts. Everyone has a good reason not to be lynched, but one of those reasons has to be wrong. The fact that there are so many claimed PRs suggests you or GiF being scum (and I know this has been argued before, but obviously no one seems to care about it and no one has given me a good reason to think otherwise, unless you count GiF's 'well it was too much before Bubba's claim, but now that he has, it's actually ok.')<br>\n<br>\nI have also been fooled by realistic-looking reports before, and I know that some scum like to set up future claims (and for some reason they all want to claim cop).<br>\n<br>\nTo add on to that, both you and GiF have been questionable to me, GiF with his stalling after Jon calling him out and his strange explanation for not thinking this is too many PRs, you for not being roleblocked and the convenient Macho claim.

If I was scum, knowing that Bubba and GiF were town, then he would have definitely been going down in my point of view. Much better to bus than to implicate myself in such a way. I wouldn't try to distract from his lynch as I did just so I could make this argument, as there's no way I would have been able to rely on it changing your mind. Obviously it looks bad, and I would've known this before doing it.<br>\n<br>\nNow onto GiF. The bussing was one thing that made me doubt him being scum at first as well and it's part of the reason why I thought it was bubba and not him, but scum do bus, it just happens. I agree it makes him less likely scum and there's not much else I can say about it. His claim too, seems town, but was a great way to be incredibly town-looking and notscience was not exactly in the best of positions. I've seen a lot of games where unconfirmed PR claims fail to save really scummy people.<br>\n<br>\nThe most glaring thing that I see is that there is just way too much town power and just imagining the reviewing of the game, I am pretty sure they'd strongly recommend taking off a PR or two. Macho Cop and Tracker are powerful investigative roles (tracker moreso than usual with the number of PRs) and you have a JOAT as well! It's just too much.<br>\n<br>\nThe most incriminating thing that I could see about GiF was his reaction to Jon's claim. Because it was an odd day, it wasn't important for GiF to withhold his claim anymore, so when asked to claim he should have just done it if town. I've already talked about why his stalling would come from scum.<br>\n<br>\nI guess you could say that <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5056908#p5056908\">1195</a> is possibly because he wanted to be able to be seen as being against his buddy, but the other stuff is just more incriminating imo.", "time": "Sat Jun 29, 2013 12:36 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=28540&start=1275", "forum": "53", "thread": "28540"}

No real issues (except one very minor mod slip-up that did not influence the game in any way). Great activity, which I would like to thank you all for - with only 3 activity-based replacements (and one of them being me throwing AA out of his hydra), you guys made this pretty damn easy for my first time. Thanks for being gentle.<br>\n<br>\nLet's talk gameplay. OMG. When a PR claim is contradicted by someone else, and that someone else flips town, you now have 0 excuses not to lynch the lying PR. Props to GIF for talking his way out of situations that I probably would have just self-voted during. GIF was persistent despite all odds (even if he tended to cause the bad odds). This was definitely more a case of town losing than scum winning, though. See Dead QT for more details - seriously, it's like 280 posts of us going \"WHY TOWN WHY\". It was really fun to participate in though - I rarely see Dead QTs that active, and it's very fun for the mod when they're able to talk to deceased players actively about how the game is unfolding throughout. Cheers especially to Amrun for keeping me comapny in there.<br>\n<br>\nLet's talk balance. Yes, town has a lot of protective power. But look at the game - 9v3v1. My reviewers and I were concerned with a worst-case scenario in which the SK stays alive for awhile and the SK/scum team hit all or primarily town players. This could mean a loss for town with only a single mislynch in a worst case scenario. To counteract that, a decent number of protective roles were put in. I'm happy with the balance of town power, even if they did wind up being overpowered by Day 3 due to the early SK lynch and the decision by AJ not to kill at all. Of course, that's not something I can plan for, as if I planned on the SK not killing the result would be a hopelessly underpowered town if the SK actually killed (which tends to happen more often than not). On final reflection, I'm actually not so happy with the scum power. The RoleCop should have been a Roleblocker. They won anyway, though, so *shrug*. You live and you learn.<br>\n<br>\nI'm not going to advertise any of my upcoming games here because I don't want to pressure anyone or spam the thread, but if anyone is interested in participating in any future games I plan to mod, PM me. I'll be able to give you a list of setups in my pipeline (no gay jokes, please). I have quite a few stored up, some of which still have pre-ins available.<br>\n<br>\nSo yeah.
