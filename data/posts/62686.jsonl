The site-wide rules apply. Read them, know them, love them, do not break them.<br>2. Play to win.<br>3. Do not edit or delete your posts in this thread. If there is a problem with a post, such as incorrect formatting, ask me to fix it for you.<br>4. Do not quote communications outside the game thread, including role PMs, quicktopics, etc., in the game thread. This specifically includes PM timestamps. Paraphrasing is allowed. If in doubt, ask.<br>5. Do not use cryptography, invisible text, tiny text, or the like.<br>6. Do not use any form of provable randomness. Claiming you rolled dice and acting on that is fine. Using dice tags is not.<br>7. Do not impersonate or pretend to be the moderator. If I edit a post, I will use <span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #0000FF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">this color</span></span></span>. Do not use this color.<br>8. Unless the moderator has specifically told you it is allowed, do not talk about this game outside of this game thread until it is completed.<br>9. Do not bring outside factors into this game. This includes, among other things, making bets, promises of real life rewards, etc.<br>10. Claiming scum by yourself is fine. Claiming scum with others is not, regardless of the truth of this claim.<br>11. Pretending to break a rule will be treated the same as breaking the rule.<br>12. We're all here to have fun. Tempers may flare, but avoid personal attacks and keep it civil.<br>13. Breaking one of these rules may, at my discretion, result in a modkill. If you are modkilled, you will become a Neutral Survivor, and thus automatically lose. Modkilling may or may not end the game day.<br>14. I reserve the right to change the rules. Rule changes will be posted in thread.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Activity Rules</span><br>1. If a player goes two days (48 real life hours) without posting, they may be prodded at my discretion, or upon being asked by another player. Prods will be announced in thread.<br>2. If a player does not respond to their prod within one day (24 real life hours), is prodded three times in the same game-day, or five times in total within the game, they may be force-replaced at my discretion.<br>3. If you will be V/LA, please alert me in the thread or via PM.<br>4. Each game day will have a deadline of two weeks (14 real life days).<br>5. In the event deadline is reached before a lynch has occurred, there will be No Lynch.<br>6. Each night will have a deadline of two days (48 hours).<br>7. If a player has a night action, but does not submit a choice before deadline, they will perform no action.<br>8. I may extend deadlines in the event replacements must be found, at my discretion. This will be announced in thread.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Voting Rules</span><br>1. Votes must be at the beginning of a new line and bolded, and in the format of <span class=\"noboldsig\">VOTE: Player name</span> or <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Playername</span>. Abbreviations, missing punctuation, and misspellings will be accepted as long as it is obvious to me who is being voted for. If I perceive it as a vote, it counts as a vote.<br>2. Unvoting is nice, but is not necessary.<br>3. Once a majority of votes is reached (# of players / 2 + 1, rounded down), that person is lynched.<br>4. All living players, including the lynchee, may continue to post until I lock the thread.<br>5. If you are dead, that is it. Do not post. Not even a \"Bah\" post.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Setup Rules</span><br>1. At least 1 player will get the Vanilla Townie role PM, which looks like this:<br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Welcome to Mini 1699, [Player]! You are a <span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #004000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Vanilla Townie</span></span></span>.<br><br>Abilities:<br>- You have none aside from your voice and your vote.<br><br>Win Condition:<br>- You win when all threats to the town have been eliminated and there is at least one town-aligned player alive.<br><br>Please confirm via PM stating your role and your alignment.</div></blockquote>"}

I think he's a bit more image conscious as scum, so I'm not sure he'd start out the way he has a scum?  That doesn't feel super strong and I was interested in how he comes back.  I do think he's starting to get on edge about some playstyles/behaviors that he thinks are detrimental or disrespectful to the game lately and maybe that's where the policy lynch idea has come from?  In bees he gave a few pretty decent rants about some frustrations.<br><br>I find some of the reactions a bit weird.  Not sciences make sense as it was directed toward him.

After my post, people started questioning my post, which is fine. But then Layla answered on Tammy's behalf. So I decided to push further, to see what would happen. Then Nacho joined in on the replying. So I'm now really interested in knowing why I can't question Tammy's motives behind that post. Now she is following Nacho's reads, but apparently isn't townreading Nacho. So I think my vote is still good. That's how things went in my head at least.

At this point in time, I feel like nacho can trick me easily into believing he's town, so even when I'm getting townfeels from his posts, I don't fully trust them.

Early game you seemed concerned that I was faking not knowing the setup.  You also originally thought it was odd that I focused a lot on me, but then you reread my iso and realized that in the context of the conversations happening in real time that it made sense.  I thought that looked town of you because you could have easily thrown suspicion on me for faking not knowing the set up.  Also rereading and thinking the things looked normal in the context of the conversation read inquisitive and your reads came out of that looking like you were honestly trying to figure out the game.<br><br>So yeah, slow start or no, I think that a certain type of inquisitiveness and honesty in trying to figure out the game translates.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>cheetory wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Tammy wrote:</cite>It feels weird that he's claiming that worrying about him is abusing his reputation before he can get invested.

I'm going to just highlight the hypocrisy problem that I already noted right here.  I have no idea what your reputation is.

Because I don't think for one second that you think that every time I have a scum read I post a bunch of questions about them and I completely believe that you know that I'll talk about my scum reads the exact way I have here.<br><br>You're also comparing apples to oranges and for someone who wants for people to understand that signs and void isn't the end all be all you're doing a fair bit of this yourself, while also not actually asking me questions about this.<br><br>SOOOOOOOOO.  Empire is a real life friend and we hydra together.  Zar used to be a \"friend\" and we knew each other before playing mafia and started playing mafia together at my home site, westeros.  Espeonage and I have several games of experience together, have been scum partners and have hydrad together.<br><br>As far as Empire/Zar goes.  It was team mafia.  I knew that empire was excited to play team mafia.  He was also on a team with Regfan.  I had certain expectations for their team interaction in that I expected that both empire and regfan would have thoughts on the game and that they would have told Zar to share their thoughts.  So when Zar wasn't showing any indication that their teammates were reading the game, while iirc his other teammates were in their games, I got suspicious.  Instead of answer my questions in a way that would be conducive to the game Zar decided to be a bit insulting (not exactly the right word).  That made no sense to me, but hey I thought quite highly of Zar until that game and reading the westeros qt, so I didn't think a town him would behave that way and instead did what he did because he was scum.<br><br>Espeonage kept attacking me for the mind-numbingly stupidest stuff.  I thought he was probably town and that his attacks were personal because they made no sense whatsoever with the way he was going about it.  I replaced out.<br><br>So, what's comparable to here? This is early game, you don't have a lot of content, I don't know you so I wouldn't know exactly what to prod you about, and I'm giving impressions of the people in this game and what my concerns are.  I feel off to a pretty good start here and actually am more engaged in the first 10 pages of a game than I normally am, so.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>cheetory wrote:</cite>Like. To me, it seems a lot like you're trying to set up a scumread on me so you have options, rather than actually trying to figure me out and all of this \"these things make me feel weird but Iunno\" feels like a weird amount of uncertainty to be throwing around while you're not even really trying to engage me on things. Are you just kind of hoping I'll sort myself out? Because this passive scumhunting feels off, especially since I have already poked at you and in response you've just kind of flopped semi-angrily at me.</div></blockquote><br><br>This feels disingenuous because I don't think that you would think it's scummy that I would talk about things I'm concerned about early without doing a lot of questioning.  <br><br>I'm pretty amused at the weird amount of uncertainty to be throwing at me when it's pretty standard.  Like people have tried to get me a waffle title for over a year now because how much uncertainty is a part of my play style.  I weigh everything and what everything could potentially mean.  That's me trying to figure things out, which is funny because you say I'm not doing that.  As scum, I always have options.  I don't have to set up a scum read on you.  As scum, I could easily call you town and change my mind a few pages later.  <br><br>You're using incorrect meta on me while claiming that it's not right/fair that people are using signs and voids, which also using signs and voids to put suspicion on me.  And yes, I do want you to sort yourself out.  How I read people is quite often how they read/interact with the game.  I poke at things as I think they're going to help me.  I'm not going to force myself to ask things just to do it.  I know when things are off in my town game, but there's not anything off in my game and I feel pretty strong here, so I'm really not sure what you're seeing.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>cheetory wrote:</cite>I also kind of feel like your angry responses to people feel too strong. Where your angry response to Zar felt like it made sense in the context, you being angry at Layla felt a lot like an unreasonably angry reaction to her asking you why you hadn\u2019t used your vote. Especially since the way she was asking you about it felt entirely reasonable to me.</div></blockquote><br><br>Part of this response is a response to the above point.  Yeah, you guys are annoying because you're not reading.  You dismissed my concerns about you before I even talked about it with something like reputation and gave incorrect meta on me.  (IE do I or don't I give a suspect pool, which yes, I do.  And even though I as a matter of course don't do reads lists, I sometimes even do those!)  It also indicated that you weren't reading, and this is my major problem with Layla.  I literally said I was headed out the door unexpectedly and would finish my post later.  I quickly gave the people I was concerned about both to remind myself what I was thinking at the time of reading the post and to get some early thoughts out there so people could see where I was.<br><br>After I posted that I had to leave unexpectedly, Layla made the comment about the vote and asked me to explain my concerns about you, which indicated that she didn't read my post completely or missed that I didn't finish because I left.  You did a similar thing in which you dismissed my thoughts before I could even finish.  <br><br>I wasn't angry when I posted Saturday afternoon about people not recognizing that I left before finishing my thoughts, slightly annoyed because I wish people would read, but hey people miss things.  I said I'd give more thoughts and clarified that in the middle of making a post I got a text message and left.  I thought that was clear.<br><br>She came back to point out that she was calling me out and then told me to respond to her other post.  While quoting my post in which I said that I had other things to talk about and would later, and clarified that I got a text message mid post and left.  That's annoying.  I would expect anyone who was actually reading and actually trying to figure things out, when it's clarified that that \"I unexpectedly have to walk out the door, this was supposed to be more insightful.  It will have to wait until tomorrow.\" was that I literally left mid-post that the response wouldn't be a stubborn blowback of \"oh I was calling you out blah blah bla\".  What I would expect from town would be, ah I didn't catch that, because to me if her big suspicion of me was that I didn't change my vote my response that I left mid thought would answer for that. <br><br>It's irksome.  Now if she wanted to claim that I was lying about leaving and I just was too afraid to finish my thoughts and put a different vote down, then hey okay.  I'd probably be more perturbed at the stupidity of that, but at least it would indicate that she'd actually read my posts.  Talking to a brick wall is not fun at all, and quite frankly that kind of thing makes me worry about scum posturing, like she can't possibly go \"ah you left, okay I'll see what you do\" because that might make her look like she's backing down or something.  I don't know how much I believe this, but a brick wall is a brick wall and it's annoying.<br><br>And what she wanted me to do was vote for aneninen whom I don't even know if I want to vote for.  I don't know who I want to vote for, so the call out for a vote would have been met with a meh regardless, but I hate when people don't read my posts when they're going to call me out or suspect me or at least acknowledge when they misunderstood or missed something."}

I think he's a bit more image conscious as scum, so I'm not sure he'd start out the way he has a scum?  That doesn't feel super strong and I was interested in how he comes back.  I do think he's starting to get on edge about some playstyles/behaviors that he thinks are detrimental or disrespectful to the game lately and maybe that's where the policy lynch idea has come from?  In bees he gave a few pretty decent rants about some frustrations.<br><br>I find some of the reactions a bit weird.  Not sciences make sense as it was directed toward him.  Feeling weird about pixel guy doing the wagon analysis already and calling it low hanging fruit.  Those are really the only ones that stuck out to me.<br><br>I just woke up and I think I'm going to go for a walk because damn it's beautiful outside.  I'll get around to actually reading the thread in a bit.</div></blockquote><br><br>Because in the midst of questioning my read on Red Coyote, it's weird that you missed what I expected and liked about red coyote.<br><br>Beyond that there are so many reasons why I could just accept a null reads feelings on another person.  I know that Nacho feels like he can read red coyote well.  Therefore there are many things that can tell you.  At this moment, I don't think they're both scum.  I have an early inkling that he's town, but I'm well aware of my failings at reading him.  Nacho didn't show concern about his opening, so I'm not going to.  Beyond that, I'm not really going to go into all the whys of why I'd take a null read into account on RC as I feel like anyone with much experience with mafia knows the benefits to watching how someone's reads develop.<br><br>I also know that a town!Nacho could be misreading a scum!Red Coyote early so even if I had a town read on Nacho, I'd still be looking at RC but using Nacho's read to balance out my own.  <br><br>If I know that someone is good at reading someone else, I always take that into account.  I also feel like you didn't really read this post because I talked about how we all played a game together in which I suspected RC horribly and Nacho was the one to pull me out of that tunnel."}

Am I the only one seeing this?</div></blockquote><br><br>I like working with people that I play with often/understand/think I work together well with.  I mean you saw a couple people remark that I didn't reach out to them; it means it's something I do.  I like having sounding boards.  Early game I don't always use said sounding boards because I'm feeling out the game for myself and getting a sense of what's going on/what my view of the game state is and then I can start to negotiate that lay of the land elsewhere.  I'm not a big fan of voting blocs, but I do believe that one of the best chances that town has to win games is for the town to somehow find each other and work together.  Recognizing other people's strengths and your weaknesses is one of the means to gaining the trust that you need to work with your town reads.  (I also think it's important to at least hear/listen to your scum reads because you might be wrong on those.)<br><br>I reached out to implosion because I haven't played with him in something like a year.  I don't have a lot of experience with him, but I've enjoyed playing with him.  In the last couple games we've played we town read each other pretty early, and in fact in both he was my first real town read.  When empire told me the game was in signups, I thought to myself that I hoped that implosion would sign up.<br><br>I reached out to nacho, well because I often do.  Nacho and I are rarely rarely town together and although we both can read each other based on other things we've been able to read each other best (or at least I have) based on how we interact with each other.  That interaction has changed somewhat over the past few months, which has made getting or feeling confident in reads on each other a bit more difficult.  That has been a failing on my part, and I'd rather not have silly paranoia on each other like we did in forest fire.  Therefore, I'm going to try to be more open.  Because if we're both town, I'd like us both the figure that out sooner rather than be paranoid about it.<br><br>So yeah, Nacho is one of the sounding boards I would want to work with in the game.  I'd listen to his reads even if I thought he was scum here because even as scum how he presents his reads and why can say something about the other person.  He's not the only sounding board or person I want to work with in this game, and although if I were scum I'd be attempting to manipulate Nacho, it would not be the way I went about it in my first post.  I'm not even sure if I would have thought to make that post in that way as scum and I don't think even if I thought of it that I actually would.<br><br>Speaking of, I was hoping Nacho would post today."}

I don't like the reasonable/unreasonable anger point: as RC said, emotions change. People are happy, angry, crying over syrup, and that emotion leaks into their posting.

I didn't even remember it myself until Nacho said that gnome messaged him from his main after the game.  That game was the first time Nacho and I hydrad, so it's almost two years old, and I was particularly busy at the start of the game.<br><br>That game also had a mechanic that made game play a little different so I'm not sure how well it translates.  It was nightless and the \"Head of Household\" nominated two people for eviction and then during the night phase all the players except the head of household voted privately to remove one of the nominees.  The scum team had a couple daykills.  We selected gnomeo and desperado for eviction night one and gnome was evicted.<br><br>I'll probably take a look back at that game tomorrow."}

I don't see the way he's pushing the Tammy read here coming from scum.  there are a few things that specifically made me think this that I can't think of right now OTOH, but on a general level, I get the impression he believes most of what he's saying, and a lot of it makes a lot more sense as town not understanding why the entire game is jumping down his throat for what he thought was an innocuous read as opposed to scum attempting to force a read for whatever reason.  I think scum would be more likely to want to drop this kind of read entirely instead of essentially continuing to go \"nup, fuck you\" like he's doing here.<br><br>from what I could tell, Cheetory's push on Tammy was almost entirely semantic.  I want to look at it more in-depth later, but one thing I disliked was <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7068576#p7068576\">358</a> primarily bc Gnomeo had explained why he was being stubborn about the read already.  it felt more like he saw a lot of people pushing Gnomeo for being stubborn about the Tammy read, thought it would be a good angle to push to look like he was doing something and there it was.  I also don't really get why he would have expected Gnomeo to be aware of how Tammy opens games (re: the first question).<br><br>I feel better about Nacho based on his recent posts.  I still don't *really* want to elaborate on what first pinged me re: him bc I'm not remotely sure about this, but he's done a much better job hitting the notes I was originally looking for in his opening posts.  his thoughts on the recent situation re: Gnomeo/Cheetory also lined up with mine fairly well, which is a bonus.<br><br>notsci alluded to me being able to read him earlier.  I thought <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7067705#p7067705\">299</a>/subsequent posts were town, but I'm conflicted on if notsci would think to fake something like that at the point where he did.  besides that, I don't remember anything he did so far standing out as particularly town.<br><br>RC might actually be town?  I'm going to defer judgement on this until I feel better bc the entire reasoning for this is his reach out to me and I don't think I'm stable enough right now to read something like that objectively without getting emotional about it.  either way he is one of the people I want to reread in-depth bc I haven't looked at most of his recent posts in full yet.<br><br>there are a lot of things I want to hammer out via interactions, but that won't happen tonight.  I do want to say <span class=\"noboldsig\">@Tammy:</span> do you remember Generic in Tales?  I'm aware it's kinda unfair for me to bring this up when I haven't explained in full why I disagree with how you're interpreting Gnomeo's read on you yet, but I don't think his reaction was unreasonable - I think he just isn't familiar with how you tend to play."}

I disagree with both of these points, but I think both of them are entirely reasonable.  the first one essentially amounts to a playstyle difference: he doesn't see why someone would sheep someone else's read unless they were town reading them.  I buy that he thought Tammy was just \"following\" Nacho's read (the post this came from was <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7065164#p7065164\">176</a>, and I think it's a reasonable interpretation of it keeping in mind he missed <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7063949#p7063949\">148</a>), and from there, it makes sense he would assume she was town reading Nacho.<br><br>I think a lot of his posts make a lot more sense with this in mind.  the logic he's pushing is consistent.  there was nothing town in Nacho's opening posts - and if he thought Tammy was attempting to manipulate Nacho, it would have been correct to call bullshit on what he perceived as Tammy town reading him.<br><br>the second one I think in particular explains a lot of why he wasn't interested in people with meta experience with Tammy telling him he was wrong.  he thinks he caught Tammy BS'ing a read on Nacho in order to manipulate him, which would be a strong point if it was correct.  thus, he doesn't want to drop it unless he's sure that's not what she's doing.  he doesn't care about people's meta experience with Tammy because it's entirely unrelated to what his point actually was (that Tammy had town read Nacho before it would have made any sense to).  keeping this in mind, I don't *really* mind his attitude here - it comes off similarly to, for instance, someone getting pissed off on principle because someone else stepped into their line of questioning, which is a perfectly fine attitude to have.  it might make sense as scum stretching to justify a fake read, but I don't think by any means it's explicitly *more* likely to come from scum.<br><br>in general, I think most of the reasoning he's pushing here happened as a result of him misunderstanding Tammy's posts as opposed to any scum-motivated reason.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7068963#p7068963\" class=\"postlink\">post 368</a>, Gnomeo wrote:</cite>awww.

I have skipped some posts because I've seen you all discussing games I was not a part of and I have no idea what to make of that. Your next post is what I was looking for after my first post. Unfortunately it took 15 pages and multiple people questioning me to get an answer. I don't really see why, to be honest. What should have happened is me questioning something that stuck out, you answering and me considering if I'm satisfied with that answer or not.</div></blockquote><br>this came after I first started saying Gnomeo's posts were town, but I also liked this.  at this point, it was pretty obvious the entire shitstorm that happened was due to a misunderstanding (Tammy sheeping Nacho's RC read vs. her balancing it out with her own read).  this is the correct reaction: step back and reevaluate.  I don't get the impression he was pushing this based on convenience; if it was, I think he would have been more likely to back off when he started getting blowback for it or continue pushing it anyway."}

I think there is scum motivation here in that 1. he's getting a fuckton of blowback for the Tammy push and this allows him to posture to back off and push Gnomeo instead later if he wants; 2. Gnomeo was a main wagon at this point and it serves to push it from the sidelines without actually getting involved with it.  the other thing is that these questions at the end are really soft.  given what Gnomeo did so far, why would he expect him to be aware Tammy usually opens games in the way she did as town at the point where he asked the question?  why *wouldn't* scum-Tammy buddy Nacho in the way she did here if she wanted to buddy Nacho?  it reads like scum flow-going and throwing in a few extra questions in the end in order to appear like they're producing original content.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">@Cheetory:</span> this was directed towards everyone, but I'd like if you could respond to/engage with me on this bc I'm aware you tend not to like people talking past you regardless of what your alignment is.

I'm not going to force myself to ask things just to do it. I know when things are off in my town game, but there's not anything off in my game and I feel pretty strong here, so I'm really not sure what you're seeing.</div></blockquote>That would be pretty scummy if this was what I was saying. But I never said you couldn't compare S&amp;V to here. If I'm fucking useless at day two and haven't done shit all then I would embrace being scumread for it with open arms, but that isn't what was happening and you should know that I wasn't saying this at all.<br>I said it felt like people were taking the entirety of how I was playing in S&amp;V and saying \"WHY IS YOUR OPENING IN THIS GAME IN WHICH YOU'RE VLA NOT AS STRONG AS YOUR MID-ENDGAME IN S&amp;V AH\", which was probably wrong, but it's how I felt.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Tammy wrote:</cite>You did a similar thing in which you dismissed my thoughts before I could even finish.</div></blockquote>How so?<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Tammy wrote:</cite>She came back to point out that she was calling me out and then told me to respond to her other post. While quoting my post in which I said that I had other things to talk about and would later, and clarified that I got a text message mid post and left. That's annoying. I would expect anyone who was actually reading and actually trying to figure things out, when it's clarified that that \"I unexpectedly have to walk out the door, this was supposed to be more insightful. It will have to wait until tomorrow.\" was that I literally left mid-post that the response wouldn't be a stubborn blowback of \"oh I was calling you out blah blah bla\". What I would expect from town would be, ah I didn't catch that, because to me if her big suspicion of me was that I didn't change my vote my response that I left mid thought would answer for that. </div></blockquote>I'll try to reread that exchange with this angle in mind sometime soon, because I think this might make sense but I need to actually look it over and follow it from start to finish.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Tammy wrote:</cite>This feels like a weird post to make after making a post all about how you think I'm scum.</div></blockquote>I felt weird writing it to be fair.

Assertions like \"she has a lynch pool, she's generally focused\" really bothers me because it not only is it based on a stupidly small sample size, its also not a very convincing reason for anyone to think someone is scum, especially when the \"focused\" reads Tammy possessed in SV was a grand total of 1.</div></blockquote> Literally the only thing I would call case-ish from my posting wrt Tammy is her getting angry at Layla didn't make sense to me. Remind me in the future to just say fucking nothing if I don't feel it's the most indicative thing. -.-<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Nacho wrote:</cite>I don't like the reasonable/unreasonable anger point: as RC said, emotions change. People are happy, angry, crying over syrup, and that emotion leaks into their posting.

Your response was then to point to random events in Signs and Void of Shadoweh saying something to you and you having a slow start, Tammy points out that it's not likely that she remembers minor events that had nothing to do with her (which I'm assuming is a rebuttal to your accusations earlier).

If I'm tracking this particular train of thought properly, Ffery expressed that she thought you were having a slow start, you made the frustration posts, Tammy backed Ffery up. Your response was then to point to random events in Signs and Void of Shadoweh saying something to you and you having a slow start, Tammy points out that it's not likely that she remembers minor events that had nothing to do with her (which I'm assuming is a rebuttal to your accusations earlier). Then comes this? Where was Tammy inaccurate with meta/harsh on you for being inaccurate on meta?</div></blockquote>I think it's more just the general sentiment of \"I can have a read on you based on S&amp;V but you can't have a read on me based on S&amp;V\".

As in, \"why haven't you obvtowned and slammed down super duper genuine pushes and reads yet?\", which didn't happen in S&amp;V at the start of the game either.<br>Being frustrated at unrealistic expectations being thrown at you in a doubtful way is different than saying \"I don't remember seeing you doing something like this in S&amp;V, which feels like a switchup from how you played in S&amp;V\" and I made it really really reallllllllly clear in this post that I didn't feel that it was super indicative:<br><blockquote><div><cite>Cheetory6 wrote:</cite>Anyways, Tammy making a PoE pool seems out of character from what I've seen from her town game.

At least respect that if I'm scum, I'm probably finding it hard to find a center of balance right now and that this isn't some maniacally stupid plan I've been scheming that would never actually work. -.-<br>I do intend to actually start pushing things, but I have a tendency to struggle if I don't respond to things before trying to focus on reading things.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Nacho wrote:</cite>What do you want me to call it if it's not a case?</div></blockquote>You know what, this is fair. You can probably call it a case if you want, because I'm looking at the post that I made and it definitely comes across that way more than I thought it did.<br>In my head it was like \"I am explaining how things seem weird to me about Tammy that I don't really have much confidence on\" and then I got to the Layla part and realized that I actually thought it was scummy and wanted to draw attention to it, so I voted her.<br>You can call it all a case if you want, but I'm just trying to make it clear that if I hadn't gotten scumfeels from the interaction with Layla, I don't think my vote would have dropped on Tammy in that post."}

I just don't really understand how that works.

However, I can see clear scum-motivation in giving sweeping reads like he did when his wagon was starting to gain momentum, in that if he does get lynched, the associations between players are less distinct, making it harder to take away who is less or more likely to be his scummate.<br><br>iii) Him being so absolute about how there's no reason to scumread him seems like pigeon poop.<br><br>Boop!<br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Anen</span>"}

That wouldn't be a strong thing to point out <span style=\"font-style: italic\">now</span> \u2013 that was just an early impression. <br><br>But,<br>I don't think anyone really cares about my posts at all.<br>If I'm here and answer things = I'm called scum.<br>If I'm away for RL reasons and don't do anything = I'm called scum.<br><br>I've seen games like this when someone gets called scum regardless of everything. Sadly said, I even joined wagons like that as town. But, at that point I strongly think staying alive wouldn't help the town at all.<br>As long as I'm alive I'll be an easy lynch for the scums. (Unless someone throws an investigation on me.)<br>However, after my flip there will be a lot of information on certain players. As a start, I'd like to point out that in the last couple of pages there has been a lot of talk, but players have been voting only for me.<br><br>Here's what I think.<br><br>My wagon has been pushed as a counter or because of a Chainsaw, or an OMGUS.<br>If the previous one, Fferyllt must be scum. A year ago, in another game she replaced in and at that time I'd been wagoned. (It rarely happens to me as town on Day1 but that was another example.) She derailed my wagon becasue he thought \"it was clear that the town was on its way to a mislynch.) My gamestart was <span style=\"font-style: italic\">very</span> similar to that game. (Yes, I did it intentionally.) Why hasn't she realized the same thing?<br>If I'm wrong about this, my next guess is RedCoyote. <br><br>Implosion is a next guess. In his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7065779#p7065779\">198</a> he expressed this: <span style=\"font-style: italic\">\"In fact, there are at least *seven* people who have either voted you or expressed suspicion! You know for a fact that many of them must be town, and townies expressing suspicion towards you are doing so for genuine (if possibly not correct) reasons.\"</span> This is a reasoning I know <span style=\"font-style: italic\">very well</span> from IRL situations (not games, real situations!) \u2013 it shows evil intent which has a clear goal: wipe someone out of a complany/workplace/community/etc. (Implosion: I'm not calling you evil; it's a game and I've done things like this before too.)<br>One more thing about him: he was the first one on my wagon but he left it later. I can easily imagine a scum pushing a wagon but leaving it so as not to get found on a mislynch later.<br><br>The third one could be amongst Nachomamma/Tammy or maybe Cheetory. Late-wagon-joins and/or shadowing. (I remember reading Tammy and finding her different from her town-Self, Cheetory's post along with the vote is an excuse-finding one, Nacho's naked vote on me was totally inorganic.) Although, NotScience's joke about \"being an opportunistic scum\" is suspicious too \u2013 however, his V/LA might explain it (I mean, making the game move before being absent). \u2013 Post-edit: the recent posts are pointing towards Tammy. (\"No idea what to do...\" \u2013 dodging the responsibility but being ready to join or to be absent. I've done that quite a couple of times before as scum.)<br><br>If it's a Multiball, I guess all of the scums are either ending up on the wagon or shadowing it. In this case, they may think something like \"I'm not sure whether Aneninen belongs to the other faction but it is worth a try.\" <br><br>If there's an SK, I haven't got an idea where to search for him/her. Either he/she's lurking around or on the wagon because of going for an easy lynch or for the same reason I said about Multiballs.<br><br>That's all I can help now. <br><br>I hope my thoughts would be worth a lot later, so, don't ignore them and <span style=\"font-style: italic\">do not let the scums bury them in the void</span>!<br><br>By the way, I'm Vanilla Townie, so there could be much worse lynches than me.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Fferyllt</span> \u2013 my best guess right now."}

Team mafia was a lot of fun and most players brought their best play to the games.  I'd play again.  But, I wouldn't assume that the best team will win next time either.  Even the process of determining \"best\" team beyond \"was on the most winning sides of four games\", wouldn't be an easy task. <br><br>I did show previous games.  Did you actually look at them?

I see where you are coming from, and I can appreciate that you're trying to go in a new direction in light of the two flips, but I hate how predictable players in this game are sometimes. <br><br>1) Of course I was uncertain. I thought the Ane lynch was a reasonable one. I wasn't convinced he'd flip scum. I mean, odds are the players we lynch will flip town. That's always the case.<br>2) I sometimes have to wonder if, as town, I need to just start being as dishonest as I am as scum. I mean, Wicked, you're essentially telling me to not be straight with you. You know what I think is straight? Telling people that a D1 lynch where you get no claims other than one VT, lynching said VT, and having them flip VT is a pretty good result for the town. That's sensible. It's not ideal, no, but that's a pretty good outcome, all things considered. Every time I find myself in a position to say that (it doesn't happen every game due to themes, early claims, early hammers, individual reads, etc), it's inevitable someone comes after me for that with some version of that same line. <br><br>...and because of all this, I like pie's <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7105295#p7105295\">785</a> a lot.<br><br>---<br><br>Going back in time a bit...<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7088966#p7088966\" class=\"postlink\">post 683</a>, Vinkah wrote:</cite>okay.  i really don't know where to push outside Anen at the moment and it is absolutely scaring the shit out of me.  the longer this day is proceeding the less my townreads are staying firm.  and its nothing more than paranoia.</div></blockquote><br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Vinkah</span><br><br>A lot of people have used similar lines, but I don't like Vinkah's.

Well, no, it's not due only to \"paranoia\" as there's certainly more than one scum. <br><br>Look, you know, we have to make some difficult choices this game. I realize a lot of Vinkah's posts give off good vibes, but you have to look at the weak posts (of everyone) and find out which seem worse than other people's weak posts. I think Vinkah has some.

I mean, this seems like a odd jump to make right off the bat. Granted, I have no problem with Gnomeo being a potential vig shot... but he's just as valid a mafia shot as any. I mean, I can think of a few better ones, but it wasn't horrible. Perhaps he was on the right track scumhunting wise? I would not automatically assume that he wasn't a mafia shot.

When I was thinking about the game state over night and who we'd likely be without, Gnomeo was one person I was convinced would be alive.  He might have had no votes on him, but he wasn't even close to being universally town read.  Now Pie might have made a town case on him, but the entire game wasn't going to just take that town case without reading him themselves and there were some meta inquiries near the end of day one.  I was beginning to suspect him based on his single-minded questioning of my entrance and not much else/miscontruing or misinterpreting things I said.  I thought it was looking like easy contribution for him to ignore the rest of the game, so he was definitely someone I was going to look into more coming into today.  From what I remember I was his sole scum target for day one and even though he started thinking I was town, I don't think he ever moved his vote off of me, so he can't have been killed for being on the right track, and I can't imagine a scum team in this player list making a kill to frame me knowing I'm innocent.<br><br>Perhaps it was a low information kill or a kill meant to ignite paranoia amongst the stronger town read group, but see those types of things are what it going to send me into squinty-eyed paranoia on people.

You already expressed suspicion of notscience yesterday, implosion was voting for notscience, other players have already expressed interest in a notscience bandwagon, notscience hasn't even acknowledged the vote on him, I seriously doubt that you and notscience are partners, and the general consensus seems to be that Vinkah is town. I like your vote and I don't see the scum motive behind it. If you were scum just trying to mix things up, then a vote for one of Anen's 578 top suspects would have also made more sense...<br><br>I'm confused because I'm leaning town for nine players right now."}

Please stop talking to me like I'm a friggin noob. <span style=\"font-style: italic\">I</span> voted for <span style=\"font-style: italic\">you</span> and asked YOU a question, which you have <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">still</span> blatantly failed to answer. This lesson that you're trying to teach me is not enlightening me as to why my vote for you is wrong and just looks like a distraction. I am (seriously) no closer to understanding you than I was when I first voted for you. <br><br>It's not like I post hundreds of questions a day. I asked you ONE question. I asked Boon ONE question. I asked Nacho several questions and he ignored the one that I was most interested in getting an answer to. I would normally vote for the person not answering my questions, but it's kind of impossible to vote for three people.  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif\" alt=\":roll:\" title=\"Rolling Eyes\">  This is absurd. <br><br>How in the world am I going to sort this game when dealing with all this ambiguousness? You keep implying that parts of your posts are reaction tests but that is ZERO help until you actually explain what was testing and what was not. Clearly I am interested in your Anen vote specifically, yet you ignored my question and started implying 'reaction test' so I don't think it was crazy for me to assume that was your defense. Now you're acting like it wasn't so I have no idea what to think.<br><br>Why can't you explain?"}

As town it's certainly possible for him to make that post. As scum, he would not have any theories about the night kill (because information), so he would have to explicitly decide to lie about having a theory about it, which seems significantly less likely to happen to me. In general I see posts like that, which scum would have had to go 'out of their way' to make, as pretty strong towntells depending on context/etc."}

You also said you were giving ffery a pass for what looked like \"slow playing\" *because* of how hard it was to get strong reads in this game.  So, why is it such a problem that ... surprise ... I don't have any strong scum reads?  Just because I'm not death tunneling someone or making any particularly strong push anywhere doesn't mean I'm not forming reads or that I don't have reads.  It means that I don't see a reason to walk around acting like I've solved the game when ... I haven't.  (This idea people have of my play, btw, is part of why I wanted to play a scum game like S&amp;S2 for a while before actually being able to accomplish it; the assessment people seem to have that I hard push reads as town and aren't capable of it as scum is entirely wrong and used to interfere with my town play because people would, and still do to some extent, assume I was scum if I wasn't deathtunneling anyone.) <br><br>This is ignoring the fact that this isn't strictly true, either.  I've laid out my town reads in the game thread already, and I feel pretty sure all of them are town.  And I think that if you sit down and actually look what I've posted instead of attempting to read my tone, you'd see I'm pretty clearly exploring possibilities for scum outside of said town reads, even if until now I didn't have particularly strong conviction anyone was scum.<br><br>There's also the fact that, outside of you apparently thinking I'm scum, the people I *am* POE'ing as scum are the same as yours.  Why is it that I'm supposedly playing such an \"uncharacteristically weak\" game here if I'm in the same fucking position you are?  I don't understand at all how you can have the exact same reads I have and then claim that I'm not playing well for ... reasons.<br><br>The point I brought up to notsci is also perfectly valid one.  I would sure as hell be able to bullshit a push on someone if I was actually scum here.  But you seem to be handwave dismissing that in order to push that me not feeling strongly about any of my scum reads = me being scum.  Do you think I *couldn't* push anyone if I was scum here?<br><br>In short, you applying this double standard to me and only me is fucking awful and makes me want to question my town read on you here.  I would like if you could actually, you know, engage me on this because your reasoning here is *seriously* misguided at best."}

It's disappointing to see three votes on me in quick succession like that, but I don't think Nacho nor SS are scum. notscience, however, has been egging people on to vote me this whole game, yet he never once had the balls to do it himself. I want to point out a pattern here. If we don't lynch him today, then I hope someone is willing to take up the mantle and hold his feet to the fire tomorrow. I'm just going to point out a few posts, but I'll keep this pretty short and sweet:<br><br><fieldset style=\"border:3px outset grey; padding:5px 10px\"><blockquote><div><cite>notscience 91 wrote:</cite>RC nottown</div></blockquote><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7062375#p7062375\" class=\"postlink\">post 118</a>, pieguyn wrote:</cite><span class=\"noboldsig\">@notsci</span>: you should wagon RC with me</div></blockquote><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7062390#p7062390\" class=\"postlink\">post 119</a>, notscience wrote:</cite><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: RC</span><br><br>I'm going to be giving [pie] sideways glances all game though.</div></blockquote><br><br>Two things to point out here.

Immediately after pie tells him to vote me (and she votes me), only then is he comfortable doing the same. Make a note of this because there's a pattern forming here. The second thing I want to point out is that vote in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7062390#p7062390\">119</a> has a noteworthy qualifier in it, \"Oh, I guess I'll vote with you... but IGMEOU!\"<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7103481#p7103481\" class=\"postlink\">post 774</a>, notscience wrote:</cite>Why are people townreading RC again?</div></blockquote><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7126293#p7126293\" class=\"postlink\">post 1121</a>, notscience wrote:</cite>Can we wagon Nacho or RC or something</div></blockquote><br><br>Okay, keeping with the pattern, here are two more instances of notscience slimming me from afar. He wants other people to do the voting so that he can join in. Neither of these times did anyone show resolve to do this on behalf of notscience (Wicked briefly voted me at the start of D2, but he removed it shortly thereafter and I think even he would say it was a rather weak vote).<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7134320#p7134320\" class=\"postlink\">post 1442</a>, notscience wrote:</cite>They don't want to lynch RC so ...</div></blockquote><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7137110#p7137110\" class=\"postlink\">post 1536</a>, Nachomamma8 wrote:</cite><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: RedCoyote</span><br><br>This is where I'd rather go.</div></blockquote><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7137287#p7137287\" class=\"postlink\">post 1545</a>, notscience wrote:</cite><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: RC</span><br><br>its about damn time</div></blockquote><br><br>And the pattern continues once again. notscience has yet to vote me on his own merits... he waits for others (in this case Nacho) to start the show, then jumps on acting like this is what he's been working towards forever. Well, yeah, he has been working towards it, in a manner of speaking. He's been working towards it by trying to get others to take the ownership of the actual wagon while he sneaks on behind them. First with pie, then he swung a couple of times and missed, and now with Nacho.</fieldset><br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: Boonskiies</span>; <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: notscience</span><br><br>In a way, I think the Boonskiies lynch was probably too sensible anyway, so I'm sort of glad Nacho voted me if only to shake me out of indifference to another day here. Whether I'm lynched, or notscience or Boon, we'll get more out of people than we otherwise would had. But, and I've said this before and I'll say it again, it's scary how accurate pie/ffrey were talking amongst themselves earlier about how to read me. They've got a real knack for it. I wonder if they're just as good with other people. And they're right on the money this game. And Nacho has that same knack, though he's misguided here. <br><br>Let me say one other thing, and this is kind of important: <span class=\"noboldsig\">I'm not a VT</span>. You can take that how you will. This may have led me to playing too conservatively. I don't know if I'll fully claim or not, but I do want that out there, I think, to influence y'alls decision on voting me or not."}

Maybe it's a little nitpicky, but when Vinkah says, \"the longer this day is proceeding the less my townreads are staying firm. and its nothing more than paranoia\", I don't understand that mentality. I understand being frustrated that you are losing townreads, but there are multiple scum in this game... so that's a good thing. Why would you shy away from this? You don't embrace paranoia, but you should embrace the chance to uncover something scummy about a player you may not have suspected before. <br>5) This certainly has some bias in it, but I don't like his turnaround on me. A couple of points on this. One, in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7137482#p7137482\">1556</a>, Vinkah claims, essentially, that I would only vote him as scum. For one thing, Vinkah never engaged me at all about voting him. For another, Vinkah has never asked me anything in this game other than about my early Layla suspicions (hint hint, Layla's roleslot just flipped town... nice coincidence). Another point, we get this possibly misdirection play in his \"I'm not reading notsci... but vote: RC\" move. Vinkah even has the wherewithal to mention this when voting me (see: <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7136942#p7136942\">1526</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7137467#p7137467\">1553</a> then <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7137481#p7137481\">1555</a>) In short, the turnaround on me doesn't feel natural. I don't see Vinkah ever trying to read Boonskiies. I see a clear dislike on notscience and a path of how he got there. I see no such thing in my case. Vinkah went from townreading me all of D1 (even getting into arguments about it), to bringing up some random topic about how I suspected Layla's roleslot (a player Vinkah himself was voting), to voting me at the last minute with ~24 hours to go.<br><br>---<br><br>Um, if anyone still has questions about my claim, I can answer.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7140771#p7140771\" class=\"postlink\">post 1801</a>, pieguyn wrote:</cite>I think RC claiming miller to \"draw the night kill\" is incredibly dumb, but he's probably town.  let's go Boon.</div></blockquote><br><br>I wasn't claiming miller to draw the NK.

I'm very sorry for claiming at the end of day yesterday.  I've been having a very bad week - I'm much better now - and while it may not have been on the table to lynch me for most, many?, of you, that's not how it felt to me.  How it felt to me was that there was a lot of free-floating paranoia about me and a couple scum reads and no actual town reads that when there was the suggestion to flashlynch me at deadline it felt like a real possibility and I freaked out.  I've been trying to keep a rational head about mafia lately, but I fail at it sometimes especially when I'm just feeling overwhelmed.<br><br>Though Red - I don't feel like I've been robotic.  I have been trying to take some suspicion on me a bit more rationally or lightly, especially if it's something I might understand, in an attempt to keep the drama from getting very toxic though I don't exactly think it's my fault if noone creates drama with me and I don't know why it's a problem if I don't create drama with someone, especially since I'm very good at creating drama as scum anyway.  I also didn't feel like I was whining or crying about my meta or being busy.  It's not just this game; it's a shift that's been happening this year, and I have been explaining it as I've been getting concerns - one of which I did in a recent game with notscience in which I explicitly said it was an explanation for that game and any future games - so it did concern me that he wasn't taking that game into account.  The fact of the matter is that I think a lot of the reason I got so easily town read is because I had a lot of time at one point to be extremely active and because I was and very engaged, I got town read very easily.  Changes in my life over the course of the year means I don't have the time for that anymore.  It's a good thing!  But it has meant that I've had to shift my approach for games.  So, when I've explained it in one game, I flip town, I expect that that would be some type of consideration for how to read me, not just expect that I'm going to suddenly act just like I used to a year ago.  I don't know if that makes sense.<br><br>Anyway, I investigated Implosion last night and got no result.  I can't understand why SS would jail keep me as that just seems silly.  I'm surprised with Implosion saying the thing about him dying being surprising considering two prs.  That death doesn't really surprise me at all if you think about it.  Nobody would kill Implosion.  Let's say he's not mafia and is in fact a 2-shot vig, why kill him?  If he takes his shot, he's essentially a VT from there on out, and leaving him alive helps with the concern that he's an SK, and if there's just one kill that he's a member of the mafia.  They wouldn't kill me for a couple reasons.  If the jailkeepre was a doc, I was the obvious protection last night, and if Implosion or Red Coyote were town, then it wouldn't matter really just to confirm them and give an obvious night kill.  And if my setup spec, hold on a minute for that, is close and if one of them is scum, mafia probably has a role blocker so it wouldn't matter.  By process of elimination they were probably able to determine who blocked the night kill (if Implosion is not mafia), so that one was a no brainer.<br><br>Anyway, for anyone interested on whether or not I may or may not actually be a town role cop, and yes I agree with a mass claim right now because I don't expect any more power but it would be interesting if someone did claim something, here's a few things to look at:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7067608#p7067608\" class=\"postlink\">post 280</a>, Tammy wrote:</cite>I've also kinda been thinking about possible setups here as I think empire likes to experiment with stuff.  I don't think he'd do multiball, but I do wonder if he'd do serial killer?  I can't remember how he feels about those.  Anyway ny 169 was him experimenting to see how a higher powered but lower numbered team would do as opposed to lower powered higher number, which he favors, if I remember correctly.  Anyway, this doesn't really mean anything just something I was wondering about.</div></blockquote><br><br>This never comes from me as a mafia role cop, because who cares mafia role cop is standard.  When I got my role, after complaining about getting a scummy investigative role, I got to thinking, why did I get a role cop?  So I looked at the wiki and they were talking about how the role cop is kinda a weak investigative role on a similar line as a tracker.  And that a role cop could get a result on a serial killer in a way a cop necessarily might not be able to.  Also, a role cop gets back vanilla results on goons and vts, so it's not a role that can really out a whole lot of people but it potentially good come mass claim time, so I thought that I could be really open about how I thought of the game but try to not make myself as much of a tempting night kill, which wasn't hard because I ended up not having any scum reads, while also trying to figure out how to make sure my results were out there in the case of mass claim.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7100453#p7100453\" class=\"postlink\">post 742</a>, Tammy wrote:</cite>You have got to be kidding me.<br><br>Also, I'm not sure what that I'll does to the great reads I didn't have.

I had several people in mind, but I settled on Gnomeo.

The bus driver in my mind would have had to have been town.  The * is me crumbing my result.  I got vanilla from targeting gnomeo, if he'd been bus driven then that person would also be vanilla and this was my result in case I died before mass claim and the bus driver outed as switching two people night one.<br><br>That's probably good enough.<br><br>I don't understand vinkah's take about empire fucking with us on a role cop/miller combo, that makes sense.<br><br>In swagtown I, there was a tracker, 3-shot neighborizer, and a body guard to three goons.<br><br>Well both the neighborizer and the bodyguard can be seen as things that the tracker can track somewhere to get some positive results.<br><br>For a role cop, a miller just serves as something to get a positive on that wouldn't show to an actual cop.  Yeah, I'd be able to confirm he's a miller, that's not fucking with anyone because a miller isn't an actual role and considering the fact that for the majority of the game, most likely, I'll be coming back with vanilla results it serves to balance out the fact that I'll be getting vanilla results for mafia goons.<br><br>I would say that the presence of a vig? means that mafia, if implosion is in fact a vig, is not made up of three goons.  But unfortunately I can't tell you if he is or ins't a vig, and I'm sorry for that."}

My idea was that we play out the day normally up until somebody wants to cast a hammer vote. Then we no-lynch and tell you to shoot the person that we were going to lynch. If there's no roleblocker/doctor and you are really a vigilante, then we don't lose any lynches by handing power off to you - but we do confirm you as town.

Pie is scum. The end of the day is the first time I've really been *into* the game. I can understand her misreading me throughout the rest of the game. Not then. That's bullshit. Especially when I KNOW she is big on actually reading the thread and understanding what is going on- if she was ACTUALLY town she would see Tammy's blowing what I say way out of proportion and me trying to explain that and work with her is something town-me would do.

Was that true? I'm rather bothered by it. Mainly because I don't see all scum in the unclaimed thus far, it clears way too many people.

Maybe all vanilla, maybe an encryptor, like one role that can *actually* be caught by a rolecop and some roles that are completely innocuous. <br><br>4) I didn't like RC's wall regarding vinkah. We were laying a lot of the groundwork for a vinkah push today, but he feels the need to present a case for something we had all been heavily considering. If implo is telling the truth, he's who I'd look to next. Tammy's felt legitimate in the way she claimed, obviously S-S was the jk so there's no denying. I'm just not sure I like him waiting to claim rather than the obvious come out with it at the start, but this is a playstyle difference that doesn't really mean anything.<br><br>5) Today's lynch should be Vinkah. Tomorrow's should be pie. I don't think Nacho/pie are scum together because I think both would have steamrolled things rather than the way they have been, but I understand activity is a part of this, but they  both aren't scum which means nacho is probably town."}

I also didn't feel like I was whining or crying about my meta or being busy. It's not just this game; it's a shift that's been happening this year, and I have been explaining it as I've been getting concerns - one of which I did in a recent game with notscience in which I explicitly said it was an explanation for that game and any future games - so it did concern me that he wasn't taking that game into account. The fact of the matter is that I think a lot of the reason I got so easily town read is because I had a lot of time at one point to be extremely active and because I was and very engaged, I got town read very easily. Changes in my life over the course of the year means I don't have the time for that anymore. It's a good thing! But it has meant that I've had to shift my approach for games. So, when I've explained it in one game, I flip town, I expect that that would be some type of consideration for how to read me, not just expect that I'm going to suddenly act just like I used to a year ago.

So you trying to push that oh my god you're town and people should be able to see it after it is disingenuous as fuck.<br><br>Second, no, Tammy did not \"blow what you say way out of proportion\", and you pushing that she did reads like blatant manipulation.  In the first place, you shouldn't have thought her being a non-factor in this game was a reason to be concerned about her here.  And then when she asked you about it, you didn't answer it.  But, regardless, her being concerned about you claiming she doesn't setup spec did not, in fact, have to do with how she plays on a general level.  I think she was pretty obviously concerned because you had missed her setup spec'ing in this game, multiple times, since practically the very start of the game.  The logic there is consistent; and even if you just happened to miss it, it is perfectly reasonable that someone would find that hard to believe.<br><br>I also refuse to believe you make <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7140868#p7140868\">1839</a> after the whole claimgate after she got paranoid she'd get lynched.  At that point, she was really fucking obviously town and I am 100% sure you should have been able to recognize it by then.  You acting unsure about her, or like she could potentially be \"scum manipulating her meta\" entirely ignores everything about how it actually played out and it reads like you're blatantly acting here.  The only reason she even brought it up was because YOU hadn't noticed where she had setup spec'd before; so claiming it could be her manipulating her meta after the fact is fucking awful.  And if you *were* concerned that that was she was doing, why didn't you just ... ask her about it?  I don't see you actually asking her anything to work out what your read on her actually is, and when she tried to ask you to elaborate on what was giving you reservations about her here, you kept ignoring it and saying stuff like \"I'm not sure so I don't see why it's a big deal\".  And when she asked you why you thought she'd specifically go out of her way to tailor her meta to you as opposed to other people in the game, we got ... nothing.  So how the hell were you trying to \"work with her\" here?<br><br>This is why I don't see a town approach in the way you played this.  In fact, it read like you were specifically trying to find something to comment on in order to look like you had a point here.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7150819#p7150819\" class=\"postlink\">post 1890</a>, fferyllt wrote:</cite>What posts of notsci's are you talking about here?</div></blockquote><br>I hated <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7140816#p7140816\">1825</a>/<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7140879#p7140879\">1842</a>.  If you're trying to work with someone, you don't fucking say something like \"read the fucking game\".

I might be reading too much into it, but I think town-notsci should have actually ... asked ... where Tammy had setup spec'd before after being told he was in fact wrong about it.  It read overly superficial and I don't get the impression he actually wanted to sort her there; it read like he wasn't sure what to actually say so he tried to act sarcastic to cover it up (this is the kind of thing I alluded to earlier re: his response to me/how people like Sakura play as scum).<br><br>Plus I think in general he should have known better than to think Tammy could be scum here in the first place (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7140868#p7140868\">1839</a>, for reasons explained above)."}

She's probably town even if more town power is claimed. <br><br>RC's vinkah case felt pretty town to me. The points didn't feel particularly fabricated and it seems like an peculiar tact for scum-RC to make to come bellowing in to this day with such a large case on vinkah, although I could imagine it as a sort of scum approach especially if his scumbuddies are people that were being pressured.

I need to reconvince myself though. Of the other four, the pie vs ns stuff of late has been of interest to me. It was what was making me ping pie as town iirc, but it theoretically could be a cross-bus. Parts of it have felt sort of self-contained in a manner that could be that but I think that's more ns's posting towards pie than pie's posting towards ns. <br><br>I think atm I'd be happy with a lynch in {oversoul, nacho, ns}. The thing that is weird about that list is vinkah's last post where he calls nacho+ns scum as he replaced out. Which I guess I can imagine as possible with that scumteam since he was replacing out. <br><br>That list is more poe than anything. I still have never seen anything from ns that made me townread him. The realization that parts of vinkah's disillusionment with the game feel disingenuous is extremely significant to me - that disillusionment was a very large part of my townread on him, in particular feeling that it echoed my own. nacho I think I want to ISO."}

Would they be inclined to bus heavily? Would they be inclined to buddy each other? <br><br>My answer:<br><br>I think the latter. The overall feeling of apathy in the town would have given scum a more-than-average amount of sway over how the town was voting, since people were looking for guidance but scum already know where they want to go. It was really hard to make a wagon stick for pretty much this entire game, IMO. Scum would, I think, take advantage of that and make it impossible for town to make a wagon on scum that sticks around.<br><br>The three people that I said I'd be willing to vote are never voting each other in any vote counts prior to d3. At all. And nacho/ns at least have gotten a fair amount of flak over the course of this game. Furthermore almost every single wagon with at least 3 people on it that was on someone other than nacho/ns/vinkah had at least one of nacho/ns/vinkah on it, with the exception of if there were multiple wagons not on them with at least 3 people each. I just feel like this is the kind of game where scum could get away with not having to bus at all. Again, PLEASE stop me if this is super confirmation bias-y. I want second/third/nth opinions on this.<br><br>I also want to look a bit more at the scramble near the end of d1. The ns wagon was static at {boon, imp, rc, pie} for at least 100 posts while other things happened. I think that's interesting. I just really wish we had a damn flip to work with :/."}

Let me put it another way: He's not trying to convince Tammy he's town (which scumanybody is obviously wont to do).

HE WAS NOT \"DELIBERATELY TRYING TO RILE HER UP\" THERE.  all that was was them misinterpreting each others' posts.  there is no ulterior scum motivation here regardless of what his alignment actually is.<br><br>the first post you quoted and said was overly antagonistic wasn't even directed towards Tammy, it was in response to ffery correcting him<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7140444#p7140444\">1692</a> was more of them misinterpreting what each other meant; again, regardless of alignment, there's no ulterior motivation here.<br><br>after that, there was literally nothing (please don't make me quote literally all of his posts to demonstrate this).  I'm looking through his ISO again and I see, quite literally, no antagonism directed towards Tammy whatsoever.  his attitude until after the hammer was entirely him attempting to work with her/answer her questions.<br><br>the other posts you're quoting and claiming are \"antagonistic\" happened AFTER THE FUCKING HAMMER.  even if he was deliberately attempting to manipulate his interactions with her (which I don't think is the case - I just think that in this case town-him would have approached it differently.  see: next paragraph), I don't see why it would be a town tell or why he would have to avoid posting it as scum, given at that point there's no risk of anything happening whatsoever (you could argue that she might push him D3, but by then she would likely have been able to step back and look at the situation objectively - which, surprise, is what happened).<br><br>I am not postulating that notsci's scum strategy was to \"deliberately rile her up and then try to ignore her\" and I feel this should be obvious if you're reading my posts.  in the first place, I'm not postulating that he's outright ignoring her; I'm saying that he's trying to *look* like he's attempting to form a read on her and like he has a point re: being concerned about her, but not actually having any solid reasoning, which is a fairly typical scum strategy when you want to fake a read.  but regardless, the entire fucking point re: his last post is I don't think he was fully aware of how he was coming across - I think he as town should have known that antagonizing Tammy wouldn't serve to get anywhere useful regardless of what her alignment actually is.<br><br>either way, I don't really think we'll get anywhere by continuing this conversation<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7156275#p7156275\" class=\"postlink\">post 2133</a>, RedCoyote wrote:</cite>So, pie, notscience is making enemies with ffrey now because that's such great strategy, right???

I only ask this because Ether is a reviewer and recently made a big stink about Vanilla Cop and stuff. Anyway...<br><br>So, at the very beginning of replacing in I was like \"hmm weird af that the little cluster of Fferyllt, Nacho, and Tammy is still alive\". That is why I initially said that group has at least 1 scum. I still stand behind that comment. <br><br>Reading through the thread, I think fferyllt is solidly town. I don't remember playing a game with fferyllt as a solo slot, but I think her play is town regardless. Fferyllt if you're scum at the end of this, I am going to be sadface.<br><br>I think Tammy is probably? town. I am little upset that I do not think she is more town in my mind. I think her play around the proposed flashwagon and notscience stuff means she is town. <br>I think Pie and Notsci coming into this day wanting to 1v1 is indicative that one of them is scum. <br><br>Ok. Anyway...<br><br>Yeah, when people were claiming. Hold on horrible music is playing right now. Ok. Yeah, when people were claiming VT I was super confused why this was happening so early but it makes sense seeing as everyone important claimed yesterday. When I saw talk that implosion claimed vig I had already read like 10 pages of the game and up to that point Implosion was my strongest scum read. Like super rage boner <span style=\"font-style: italic\">hard</span>. Hm. wrong game. But yeah, implosion's opening posts I absolutely HATED. I thought to myself, unless he has a BALLER claim/crumb he is 100% going to be my lynch today. He was the controversial opinion that I eluded too earlier. When I got to his claim, his VIG claim, it was pretty baller. Reminds me of my own types of claims. Placed at the tail end of the day, when putting Anen at L-1 at a time he thought Anen could be lynched. That all seems town motivated. However, holy fuck the coincidences of EVERYONE targetting Gnomeo night 1 is really, really, really <span style=\"color:#000000 !important; background:#000000 !important; padding:0px 3px;\" title=\"This text is hidden to prevent spoilers; to reveal, highlight it with your cursor.\">not likely</span>. <br><br>His choice of shot on Gnomeo is super sketch. Like Pie pointed out, Gnomeo was not in a \"viggable\" spot on his reads list and the reasoning that he \"went\" with town's opinion is utter shit. SCUM ARE APART OF THE PEOPLE IN THE TOWN. HELLOOOOOO. The only reason you ever do that is if there are two wagons that have been competing all day and you need both flips to progress through the game. Gnomeo was not that type of kill. So yeah, the claim itself looks legit but the play surrounding the claim looks so unlegit. Like god. I wish I was the vig. So sad.  Anyway, implosion AGAIN choosing not to shoot is sketch as fuck. And if he *doesn't* shoot tonight he is 100% the lynch tomorrow. Even if scum have an RB, and it SURE as hell better not be a more than 2 shot RB or the reviewers sux, implosion should be confirmed tomorrow. Tammy should take a 50% on choosing one of RC/Implosion I think. HOWEVER, I think implosion should choose to shoot RC. BUT fuck. One of the main reasons I want to shoot RC is because of his claim.<br><br>When I saw RC's claim that was like when my mind started to implode and leak out my nostrils and ears and tear ducts. It was bad. Oh my god bad. Miller is a claim that scum can preemptively play like... And RC in my mind is like the complete opposite of Implosion. Whereas with Implosion I HATED his play throughout the day, I thought RC's play was not that bad during the day. Whereas with Implosion I loved the claim, I hated RC's claim. I think both of those dropped the ball somewhat with how to play the role effectively. RC playing dumb about a death miller is also sketch too. <br><br>ANYWAY Ya. THEN TAMMY CLAIMS ROLECOP AND I'M LIKE WTF WHY WOULD SHE DO THAT AT THAT MOMENT. And that was when I was like wtf spamming the thread.<br>But she had a town explosion of emotion so I think she is probably town. I hope she is town. I've never actually played AGAINST Tammy scum that I can remember? Maybe one of those Stack the Deck games on an alt of mine? I can't remember. Can't be asked to find it. <br><br>But yeah... <br><br>Prior to getting mind fucked I was like \"lol this game is so easy, scum team is Nacho, Implosion 1 of {RC, Notsci, Pieguyn}. Before I got mindfucked I was heavily leaning on Pie scum. DOn't know how she plays but I thought Notsci was being pretty town during the early days. But yeah. Nacho has been a scum read of mine since around the time of growing lynch boner for implosion. He was a pretty early scum read of mine. I think Nacho also makes sense with Notsci scum. Nacho should have caught notsci scum by now like he did in that other game we just had. Forgetting the name, Nightingale. Yes. I expected BoP on Nacho to give us a determinant read on Notsci. <br><br>WICKED<br>Man I thought he was town throughout the entire day but since Claimgate 2k15 I honestly have no idea. I could talk myself to seeing him as scum. He doesn't seem to have as much of presence today as he did earlier which is indicative of his place in the game. But damn. My gut says he is town.<br><br>So yeah. Some super sketchy stuff going on and I don't have much time to elaborate so I just SoC this all over the place. <br><br>Reads (town to scum)<br>fferyllt<br>Tammy<br>Pie<br>Wicked<br>Implosion<br>Red Coyote<br>Notsci<br>Nacho<br><br>Also, loljk. I am <span class=\"noboldsig\">Not a VT</span><br><br>Tammy is going to target me tonight to confirm what role I actually am.<br>Nacho wagon is justice though and really surprised that Fferyllt and Tammy have not been probing him more given his not good play thus far. Notsci in the 1v1 with Pie is also probably my vote given the weird accusation about Tammy not setup speccing when I definitely remembered her spec'ing in We the Purple and earlier in this game and I have a bad memory.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Nacho</span><br><br>So yeah..."}

If oversoul is scum and he makes a big post everyone but me and RC likes, then that is the absolute perfect time for her to spend some town cred pushing me. Bonus is she knows that she's justified in feeling paranoia based on some of the recent games together and she knows that I probably won't push her back in response to paranoia since I normally don't, so even if she doesn't get me lynched, she knows she's probably safe and she knows taking a position like that in response to my oversoul read is immediately going to make me doubt my oversoul read. If we were to get really, really crazy then it might even be possible that Layla jailed me N1, Ffery shot me, and that explains why S-S treated his scum read on me the way he did (kept it in the back of his mind, didn't really pursue it) and it would most definitely explain why S-S died in the night almost immediately because no one else had a weird interaction with me and the only person who would probably protect me N1 would be Tammy who claimed rolecop at that point :/<br><br>The reasons I thought Ffery was town dealt a lot with how she opened the game; normally her first few posts as scum are the weakest until she gets in a good groove. I liked her interactions with S-S a lot; her townread on that slot seemed like she was refreshed and relieved and I don't think that tone really comes across in her posting that clearly as scum. I thought that us voting together as much as we did was a sign of a good mind meld but then she could be following me too closely, but then I liked her challenge of me when I voted RC but never really understood the strong Vinkah townread, especially now that I think I know who he is?<br><br>Coming above ground now."}

Damn, this is going to be a tough call. <br><br>In any event, as Wicked/Nacho have been saying, Oversoul can't buy a town post. The poor guy is trying every trick in the book. That slot is not salvageable. Whichever person between pie/notscience is the first to get with the program will be interesting to see."}

Then her whole, \"I don't want to pressure people that just replaced in out of principle\" stance was weird. Way too forced sounding. Either you think the slot is scummy or you don't.

It's sitting out there in the thread in a strange place with no obvious antecedent because the drivers were all internal.  Anyway, he's been going back and forth with you over one vote most of the game day while all this crap is happening between notsci vs pie.

I only had like an hour-hour and a half to post/read this game before I left and this isn't the only game I need to give attention (there's a few other games on this site/offsite that I need to remain caught up in), and even that was on/off because we're in the middle of moving a house and there's a lot of random shit my parents call me for.  So, given the time I had, I hardly had any time to actually sit down, read the game in-depth, and do stuff.  Most of when I actually have a hard block of time to read/make actual cases in games comes really really late at night.  The majority of what I read, not counting Nacho's posts, was RC and implo posting what looked like ridiculous reasons for Oversoul being scum here.  Based on the fact I had other shit I needed to do, the only thing I could really say was that the Oversoul wagon was awful; I didn't really have a chance to sit down and make an actual case on why the way Oversoul played this wasn't coming from scum or why, specifically, I think Nacho is trying to push a counterwagon here.  So yeah, it is an activity-related reason.<br><br>I was already really on edge because notsci's approach this game day has essentially amounted to repeating that I'm scum over and over without any logical reason for it.  Which, in addition to being the exact same fucking shit Nacho pulled in the last game where he was scum against me and got me mislynched (and he's doing the same fucking thing again here, he's just being a lot more low-key about it and doesn't have me as his primary read), is just a really stupid scum strategy (and is something I've seen a lot of recently from people like MS and Titus) and something I wish people would stop doing entirely because it takes all the enjoyment out of the game for me.  It essentially reduces the game to whoever is more active and is best able to outyell everyone else; which, in the first place, is not something I'm capable of doing in my current position RL-wise (the fact that Nacho was able to walk in here and flood the thread with posts to push the Oversoul wagon is testimony to this), but it's not fun at all.<br><br>I also saw more similar posts coming from him - as one example, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7159849#p7159849\">2355</a>.  I have no idea how people *ever* read posts like this and think it's coming from anything *but* an overdefensive-scum mindset.  This is the kind of shit people like BRO always pull as scum (which he did in the last game I had with him and I correctly called him out on it) and I have no idea how it apparently continues to work every game despite it being transparent as fuck.<br><br>The other thing that has me really on edge here is that I think it's really fairly fucking obvious I'm town here if you read the end of D2; there is literally no reason I would have played it the way I did as scum unless I'm scum with RC.  And, SURPRISE, both notsci and Nacho are trying to act entirely like that point doesn't exist.  They don't have any counterargument for it, so they just attempt to mist over it and justify it with \"lol, ur better at logic than me\", never mind the fact it's entirely objective and it should really be fucking straightforward to explain any sort of reason I would have done it as scum.<br><br>I am sorry if my reaction was overblown.  At that point, I had been watching the thread for  about half an hour, but hadn't been able to post because I was playing a game with some of my other friends and so I couldn't actually type a response to anything - and then I kept seeing him trying to push more and more blatantly false reasons for me being scum here.  Then he tried to claim that it was scummy that I wasn't \"derailing the Oversoul wagon\" (when I had done basically all I could given the time I had for the game) and I lost all interest in being civil here.  It didn't remotely help that in another recent game I played I was in a similar position RL-wise and had people pushing that I was scum for \"avoiding the thread\", and felt for a majority of the game until I *actually* had more time to do anything to begin with and was able to post a bunch of analysis that no one would town read me or be willing to pay attention to anything I was writing that game.<br><br>Lastly, I am taking Nacho seeing this and still scum reading me as a hard scum claim (if his push on ffery wasn't enough of one already).  And notsci attempting to double down after seeing this is entirely bullshit.  I'm nowhere near an emotionally manipulative player as scum, and he knows this about me (Nacho correctly pointed this out in the last game we played).<br><br>If anyone has any questions, don't hesitate to ask.  I'll write about Oversoul and probably some other stuff in a separate post, but this might not come tonight since I don't remotely feel like doing anything intensive right now."}

And while intellectually I realize that is a dumb reason to scumread someone or be happy with them as a lower tier read and leaving it at that, I haven't wanted to push pie harder because I have no real reason to and thus would be pushing her based on POE and nothing else and I know that she would hate that based on our relationship and it's the type of move that would burn bridges as far as mutual trust goes in this game. It's been my intention to reach out to her wrt the notscience read, but I've just gotten distracted doing other things with my still limited time."}

I think if he was scum here, he'd either go balls-deep and continue with the PR claim or retract it immediately, not fucking both.  in fact, I think continuing with the PR claim would have been a *lot* more convenient for scum-him here; it'd at the very least give him a greater chance at getting out of the lynch (and, if uncontested, could potentially allow him to survive to endgame).<br><br>retracting it, on the other hand, essentially doesn't do anything besides make him look bad.  seriously.  what the fuck does scum-Oversoul have to gain by retracting it in the way he did?  somebody (I'M LOOKING AT YOU, RC) please tell me because it doesn't make any sense and I still haven't seen a compelling reason for it anywhere.<br><br>I also don't make anything of him asking Tammy to rolecop him when he was in reality just a VT, for the obvious reason that he should theoretically just be able to kill Tammy anyway if he is scum here.  I also think that due to him/Tammy apparently having a lot of experience with each other, he thought Tammy would see a potential VT result on him and pick up on what he was trying to do (that is, she would see him as clearly town for it as opposed to questioning why he lied).  so the fact that he did that doesn't bug me.  I also don't really agree that it was as misleading as a lot of people in this game seem to think it is - I had thought of the possibility that he was just VT fake claiming when it first came up (see: the first line of my setup spec post), and it appears some others had done the same.<br><br>outside of the claim, I thought the sheer level of conviction he had in response to his wagon read town.  <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7158260#p7158260\">2288</a> is one post in particular that makes me think this; I have no idea how people can read posts like this and think it comes from a scum player.<br><br>I think that the Oversoul wagon is in large part a scum power play - in no small part due to certain people's changes in reads from D2/D3.  Nacho spent the end of D2 pushing RC.  D3 comes up, RC makes a huge case on Vinkah's slot, and Nacho <span class=\"noboldsig\">forgets about the RC scum read entirely and goes to push Vinkah along with him.</span>  DOES ANYONE SEE THE PROBLEM HERE?  as for the points themselves, most of what Nacho has posted about Oversoul has been entirely ridiculous, and RC's push essentially amounts to Oversoul lying being \"anti-town\" without considering what the motivation for it actually is (correct me if I'm wrong on this because that's all I've fucking seen so far)."}

The NotVT claim was atrocious nonsense and manipulative, and seemed like an easy choice for \"claimed power role most like to be fake\" at the time.<br><br>Now there's a question of would Oversoul play like this as scum; I guess I've always imagined his scum game a lot more methodical and his town meta random but a lot of what he's talking about doesn't make sense, I hate the way he interacted with my read on him, and the confidence is blarge and also I really can't see him being one of the town reads in the group I was working with earlier.</div></blockquote><br>I hated this angle in general because rather than actually pointing out what was manipulative or atrocious about the not-VT claim or analyzing the motivation behind it (spoiler: he can't), he handwave dismisses it.  it also fails to take into account what Oversoul actually said in the game thread: that he was attempting to draw a NK, and that part of this was trying to force a Tammy investigation on him, which is entirely pointless if he claims what his role specifically is.  there is also that simply claiming not-VT is the most reasonable option from a town POV because if you claim a specific PR you risk outing an  *actual* PR and getting yourself lynched, yet he tries to spin it like Oversoul has to claim it in that way as a result of him saying he'd lynch any other PR claim - never mind the fact that the exact same thing should theoretically hold for a blanket non-VT claim the exact same way it would for a specific PR claim.<br><br>it's essentially him attempting to attribute Oversoul's actions to some ~cosmic scum motivation~ when the actual motivation, alignment-regardless, is what Oversoul said in the game thread, which is a fairly common scum strategy when attempting to fake a read.<br><br>SOMEBODY PLEASE TELL ME WHAT I'M MISSING HERE."}

No. That's the hardest aspect of this for me to believe is that Oversoul, as town, could actually think to himself \"hmm I need to protect other power roles, this is the job for me, this could actually work\". It's an awful gambit if he's town.

I also don't really agree that it was as misleading as a lot of people in this game seem to think it is - I had thought of the possibility that he was just VT fake claiming when it first came up (see: the first line of my setup spec post), and it appears some others had done the same.</div></blockquote><br>By that same logic, he should realize, if he's town, that Tammy has a high chance of dying tonight.

I don't see why this is something that you think town-me wouldn't say; I'm looking for a lot of scum in a tiny player list full of people towntelling. I'm looking for any damn reason that someone could be scum because if I just go by process of elimination alone then I'd have eliminated everyone a long time ago, so I can only rely on the more confident of those eliminations right now. I also don't see how that's fueling a fire given that pie isn't taking a ton of heat at the moment. <br><blockquote><div><cite>Nacho wrote:</cite>Implosion's weak interjection here looks exactly like his weak interjection after the pie posts.

Sue me. <br><br>RC I really actually do need those reasons for wicked to be town though, the more that I think about it. I'm looking for scum in {OS, Nacho, Wicked, pie, ffery} and my gut is telling me that nacho's posturing right now is town, or at least that the way this day is playing out makes nacho + os both scum unlikely. So I have very few options for who is scum if I'm to have my thoughts remain consistent. <br><br>I'm definitely comfortable with lynching OS if he's going to lurk away after his \"obvtowning the slot\" didn't work. I know RL is a thing, but I feel like the sudden drastic drop in activity and in general adamancy is suspect. I want to know if RL is the only cause. I feel like this day has been very smooth sailing in terms of being able to get stuff accomplished and that now, suddenly, one key person has become inactive and is impeding that process because of that."}

It felt like he went through multiple instances of being dead-certain that pie was scum and then retracting that certainty, like a real paranoid townie. Like someone who felt that their view of the game was starting to collapse and that they had to change something. pie's was very sudden and felt reactive to notscience. <br><br>It comes down to this: pie's suspicion of notscience was extremely consistently unwavering. Iirc, she was constantly tunneling notscience even through the early stages of notscience trying to work with pie/showing paranoia over the pie scumread (point out if I missed pie stating some uncertainty over her notscience read because if I did miss something like this then this argument has a lot less merit). That level of dedication to the scumread doesn't feel like something that pie could just sleep on and suddenly be over. Conversely switching to a townread on notscience there is *extremely* convenient for pie-scum: notscience was becoming a less in-vogue scumread, and it gives pie the opportunity to start pushing nacho (this makes more sense if nacho is town, which i think in turn makes sense if oversoul is scum). I guess I am somewhat pushing an oversoul-pie team here. I guess nacho town doesn't technically strictly imply oversoul scum assuming my strong townreads but i think it does by poe unless it's something like pie-ffery-wicked which would be silly. <br><br>Idk. Pie's continual level of seeming anger towards notscience without any second-thoughts at all turning into her suddenly being willing to work with notscience just feels wrong."}

From my impression of their dynamic scum-notscience would know that trying to elicit a townread from pie would be futile and so would just try to appeal to those already townreading him and go after pie that way. That combined with notscience's very genuine-seeming development of paranoia just does not strike me as scum.

Or did you literally flip entirely in one night? <br><br>Another thing that bugs me at a really basic level is just how you both were convinced to an absolute degree that each other were scum and then it disappeared. Reads change and shit. But the fact that you were completely convinced on each other to the point where you were willing to throw the game if you were wrong at some point in time bugs me. For some reason the you -&gt; notscience direction of that bugs me more. It might be because of ns saying that you tend to be more logical than he does.<br><br>There was a part of me 2 hours ago that was convinced that if we lynched os and he flipped scum that I was going to shoot you and you'd flip scum. Convinced is probably the wrong word actually, more anticipatory. I feel like if you're town then my next best bet right now is oversoul/wicked/ffery. Which I guess there's nothing theoretically wrong with."}

But the VT, not VT, VT charade is confusing/different, and it has earned him town credit because it's a strange thing for him to do as scum! e.g. He is being townread by you right now and doesn't seem to have suffered in any way from it (anyone scum reading him right now already did iirc). <br>4.

I know that me typing this IS that world in one sense, because the claim has made me think that he's town. But more generally backup rolecop is not an extremely believable claim. I guess thinking about it on another level the only way it reasonably makes sense is if he wanted to claim backup rolecop as a springboard to getting me mislynched, since he figured that we'd just auto-lynch from VT claims+RC with the three claimed power roles seeming like a very reasonable setup. I guess I could actually see that making sense.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Nacho</span>: since you didn't claim your role during the massclaim, did it ever cross your mind that you'd be scrutinized for that? Did you think to drop some kind of crumb so that we would know that you aren't just making up the claim post-massclaim because it's scumvenient? Did you think that we would just believe you when you claimed, and so didn't feel the need? Or did you just not even consider it?<br><br>WRT the stuff you said about you pie, yeah, I guess it makes sense but I still have some waffles. Idk. Gun to my head I guess I'd say os/wicked/ffery at this particular juncture in time. This game still sucks in terms of getting any theories to stick. Granted I wrote this paragraph before the above. I might be more willing to see scum nacho now.<br><br>I still think nacho/os probably aren't scum together."}

Unless he is some Fate, Katsuki, Kuribo, DGB hybrid level of cheekiness, a vig claim as scum is suicidal. I *can* see a few options for a scum member to claim vig, but I do not think implosion would do it on Day 2, especially with how shittily he did. His claim was rubbish. I think implosion would have more tact as scum to put something decent together. A Bookie is the only way implosion-scum can reliably claim vig or else he has to explain every night why a kill is missing. Additionally, implosion has been doing townie things since I have joined the game. This all leads me to believe that implosion is likely town. <br><br>Looking at the composition of my wagon, it is quite simply absurd. There HAS to be scum on my wagon. In no world do THREE of our FIVE supposed power roles all vote the same person and ALL share the same alignment. Given that, I am now almost exclusively looking at Nacho and RedCoyote.

Unless the town can guarantee that the 1v1 takes out the BEST scum player on the scumteam or the MOST powerful role, it is always going to be inherently scumsided. Why? Because in most cases, the town will be lynched first since there are 3 (at least in this case) votes that are most likely going to go against the townsperson in that I case. Additionally, Notscience was okay with dying if we lynched Pie the next day, yet that is one of the most detrimental things to do for the game if Notscience is town. For 2 night kills and 1 town lynch (from Notscience's point of view), we get 1 scum and put ourselves right back into LyLo.

I think if he was scum here, he'd either go balls-deep and continue with the PR claim or retract it immediately, not fucking both.  in fact, I think continuing with the PR claim would have been a *lot* more convenient for scum-him here; it'd at the very least give him a greater chance at getting out of the lynch (and, if uncontested, could potentially allow him to survive to endgame).<br><br>retracting it, on the other hand, essentially doesn't do anything besides make him look bad.  seriously.  what the fuck does scum-Oversoul have to gain by retracting it in the way he did?  somebody (I'M LOOKING AT YOU, RC) please tell me because it doesn't make any sense and I still haven't seen a compelling reason for it anywhere.</div></blockquote><br>I agree that it's the towniest thing that he's done and I can't say I can explain the motivation behind it well. However, I can't at all explain the town motivation behind it (not a little bit), and I think part of the confusing nature of it is based on how he obviously obviously came up with the plan after he claimed VT during the massclaim, thus it wasn't thought through very well as either alignment.

I also think that due to him/Tammy apparently having a lot of experience with each other, he thought Tammy would see a potential VT result on him and pick up on what he was trying to do (that is, she would see him as clearly town for it as opposed to questioning why he lied).  so the fact that he did that doesn't bug me.  I also don't really agree that it was as misleading as a lot of people in this game seem to think it is - I had thought of the possibility that he was just VT fake claiming when it first came up (see: the first line of my setup spec post), and it appears some others had done the same.</div></blockquote><br>I can't think of anyone in this world who I have that kind of relationship with where I would be able to go \"here, let me fakeclaim a power role and have this person investigate me but they won't really investigate me because they know I'm town and fakeclaiming!\", and I think anyone making that assumption of anyone else is unreasonable as hell except in extraordinary circumstances. My current working theory is that Oversoul's initial intention was to have Tammy investigate him overnight so that she wouldn't worry about his alignment during the day and then kill her overnight, but the real reason why this particular exchange is a concern instead of an \"oh oversoul!\" moment is that it seems like he's overcompensating with his interactions with Tammy. When someone reads you well through interacting with them, the next response after lurking and avoiding is overcompensating; it happens when I'm scum and overcompensating for tone with flowery language, and it used to be really prevalent in games with people I was afraid of where I would interact with them just a little *too* much and in places where it didn't make sense. It didn't make sense to draw Tammy in to bolster his gambit, but I have an idea of why I think he did it as scum."}

I'm not surprised you're scumreading me now that it's obvious that isn't going to happen.<br>2) Giving a false innocent to the rolecop doesn't really make sense unless there's two, which, um. It doesn't make sense because a rolecop is only going to get a true innocent on the miller and one guilty on the scumteam most likely. <br>3) They're dumb speculations that I don't remember seeing. If you ARE town and neither of us are lynched today, and scum somehow have a doctor, then the setup is really dumb but it's not like we don't have a fighting chance anymore. You can also conceivably shoot outside of me and still confirm yourself as town and me as very likely scum, I can still fight the next lynch on me because there will still likely be people alive who read me and I don't like losing because of bullshit, etc."}

I remember back in the epicmafia days when people always thought self-description was pointless but I'd always disagreed with that. So let's see...<br><br>1) The vig softclaim &amp; claim. If I were scum, from an outside point of view, I would have had to be planning a vig claim from day one since I breadcrumbed it. I would have had to have the creativity to crumb it when something relevant to me faking vig had been said. I don't think I would have been able to come up with that as scum. There's exactly one game that I can think of as scum where I made a really ballsy fakeclaim, and I did it basically because I was entirely on my own (it was a 9p game and I was replacing into a slot whose scumbuddy was pretty much going to be the d1 lynch, and wound up being the d1 lynch) and it was the only way I could imagine winning. I'd have no reason to set up a vig claim of all things as scum who doesn't know the setup on day one. I'd be setting myself up for certain death if there was actually a vig. I'd be setting myself up for certain death if vig doesn't fit the setup (which it does, because we already have claimed/dead investigative and protective roles to go with it). I constantly *CONSTANTLY* told the town throughout the entirety of day two that they could direct my shot if they were mistrustful of me. That would be absolutely suicidal as scum. <br><br>Most of the rest of what I can say is meta-specific, i.e. it's just a description of my town and scum playstyles and how this does not fit my scum playstyle. And this is somewhat difficult to do since, again, I can't remember the most recent scumgames I've played well since they were a long time ago. I certainly would not be switching to townreading you for the sake of getting you to townread me back; that doesn't work in practice and like I've said, my style as scum is to mostly go with genuine reads as much as I can. Why would I as scum give that much of a shit whether or not you in particular townread me? You're one of the most widely scumread slots in the game; if I were scum I would not need to devote particular attention to your slot. <br><br>If you were asking me this question and were actually interested in the answer I could ISO myself and give more. But that isn't really worth it.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>What was the game?</div></blockquote><br><!-- l --><a class=\"postlink-local\" href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=62685\">viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=62685</a><!-- l --><br>Town: 2-shot vig + rolecop + gunsmith<br>Scum: goon + doctor + watcher variant (automatically watched the scumkill if they made it)"}

Um no that's not true, try again. You're being ridiculous. Did I \"maintain them as my top two for the entire day\" or did I \"not really commit to either\" ? You can't argue both in the same sentence. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">That's a contradiction.</span> <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif\" alt=\":roll:\" title=\"Rolling Eyes\">  I had been pushing Nacho and scum reading Vinkah since day 2. Day 3 was no different, they were my top two scum reads for ALL of day 3 and I almost always had my vote on one of them. I probably focused 75% of my energy on arguing why they were scum yesterday (which isn't bad considering their inactivity). I even made a big post arguing with <span style=\"font-style: italic\">your</span> Oversoul-defense - nice of you to forget.  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_igmeou.gif\" alt=\":igmeou:\" title=\"IGMEOU\">  So this \"not really committing\" point is garbage.<br><br>2. This also doesn't make sense. You think I was distancing from Nacho, but you also think I didn't want the attention if he got lynched. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">That's a contradiction.</span> No, if I was bussing Nacho, then I would want it to be at least somewhat noticeable. And again: I was scum reading Vinkah long before he became a wagon, so this opportunism point is also bad. <br><br>3. You can't argue that my Nacho-push was weaker than my Oversoul and then criticize my Oversoul push in the same sentence. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">That's a contradiction.</span> <span class=\"noboldsig\">See the pattern everyone?</span> I have several other problems with this sentence from you. a.) I explained why I didn't have much reasoning for my Nacho vote, but it doesn't seem like that explanation really interests you. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_shifty.gif\" alt=\":shifty:\" title=\"Shifty-Eyed\">  b.) You are calling my Nacho-reasoning weak, but my vote for him was certainly not the least-justified vote. c.) There's <span style=\"font-style: italic\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">zero</span></span> motivation for me to craft a multi-point case for Nacho-scum when I was already getting lots of support AND when I genuinely didn't have any other points to give AND when I have other things that I like to do in my life. <br><br>Seriously, give me a friggin break, this post is awful. Starting to feel like you might be the townread I was wrong about and that I'm <span style=\"font-style: italic\">your</span> final mis-lynch target. You spent the entire game ignoring me and now that Oversoul's gone, it's my turn, huh? <br><br>You haven't given a single legitimate reason for disliking my Nacho push. Instead you've just attacked the push without considering my reasoning. You are dead set on scum reading me today. If I had taken any other stance with regard to Nacho (ignoring him completely or defending him against the bandwagon) then you could still easily scum read me for <span style=\"font-style: italic\">not</span> attacking him. But the fact of the matter is that I attacked Nacho so you have to scum read me for \"bussing\". But really I could have taken any stance wrt Nacho and you'd have found a way to have issue with it I bet. Again, it seems like this is true, because your reasons are awful/forced and you've ignored my town motivation/explanations for everything I've done. <br><br>Hmm... on the topic of bad Nacho votes - what would you think if a player pushed the bandwagon and then <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7171867#p7171867\" class=\"postlink\">unvoted for weak reasoning</a> ?

Note that their fight started shortly after the day began. A connection between them would also explain why they are both town reading each other now despite previously scum reading each other with certainty. I initially thought it was town v town, because they were both decently strong town reads, but it's becoming clear to me (now that Oversoul/implosion aren't mafia) that at least one of them is scum. So now scum v scum is a very legitimate possibility in my mind. Furthermore, I have trouble seeing scum push a townie as hard as they pushed each other: scum v scum makes more sense than scum v town. <br><br>Pie/Nacho - Pie didn't really start pushing Nacho till the middle of yesterday (IIRC), voted Nacho, but ended up unvoting towards the end of the day and changing her read on Oversoul from town to scum. She scum read <span style=\"font-style: italic\">me</span> for leaving myself the option to switch to the Oversoul wagon, but I had been scum reading Vinkah long before he became a wagon, so I think this point is more applicable to her. <br><br>notscience/Nacho - I honestly can't remember any of their interactions off the top of my head, which on its own might be a sign that they're scum together.

Regardless of your alignment, I'm starting to get frustrated with you (and the people that don't see how you're so wrong). <br><br>1.

If I really wanted the ability to switch my vote from Nacho to Oversoul, then listing Nacho as my top suspect wouldn't prevent me from doing that. <br><br>3. Doing nothing to lynch him?!? Are you friggin kidding me? I did more than most/all of the other players that voted for him. I started the wagon on him on days 2 and 3, gave actual reasons for doing so beyond gut/POE, and I argued with him throughout the last day.

Anyway, we're splitting hairs. <br><br>ffrey, you really want me to find comparable meta to this one? I haven't been speaking much to this subject because it's totally self-serving for me to chime in, imo, but when you're seriously bringing up Eclipse Mafia as a good comparison, I'm skeptical of your decisions. All joking aside about <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7138737#p7138737\" class=\"postlink\">how you can read me better than I can myself</a> (regardless of what happens this game, I remain impressed with the accurate nature of some of the things you said about me earlier this game), I do have to live with myself. Thus, I know a thing or two about how I act in certain situations. Eclipse Mafia in no way, shape or form is indicative of my mindset here. We're talking polar opposites because that was me at peak confidence. Let me bring up three town games which are more better indicators of where my mind is at:<br><br><fieldset style=\"border:3px outset grey; padding:5px 10px\"><a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2711036#p2711036\" class=\"postlink\">Subject: ATHF Mafia OVER(roles and whatnot revealed)</a><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>RedCoyote wrote:</cite>...Oh, wait, it wasn't podium.

You guys can lynch me if you want.</div></blockquote><br><br>Not quite the same situation (this had to do with me misreading my PR results), but the effect is the same. As town, if I think I'm not really helping the town's chances, I turn a bit morose. I dislike being unhelpful. In this situation, I had fumbled my role results twice and didn't think it was reasonable to expect the rest of the town to still see me as genuine. Similar to this game, I see myself making one bad move (hammering town), after another (pushing Vinkah to the point where he replaces out), after another (being unable to draw a NK), after another (having to claim), after another (pursuing townOversoul), after another (effectively aiding Nacho's intent to draw a shot from implosion) after another (being unable to articulate how clear it is in my mind that Tammy's role should necessarily give you, if not total 100% comfort that my role claim is genuine, at least a strong sense of doubt in the possibility that I'm scum ... and this isn't speaking to you necessarily, ffrey, moreso to pie/ns). So the culmination of all those things gives me pains in my stomach that are only being prolonged as I feel like I see the writing on the wall going into D4. <br><br><div align=\"center\"><hr style=\"height:14px; width:20%\"></div><a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3133014#p3133014\" class=\"postlink\">Subject: DEFCON Mafia 3.0 - Over, American Victory!</a><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>RedCoyote wrote:</cite>I see your point, inHim.

Here is a situation where I was lynched on D1 after actually being seen as relatively townie most of the day. My top scumread at the time was the leading wagon and I was riding high. Late into the day, I suggested that another wagon should also get some attention so that the town may benefit further down the line from an atmosphere where there were two competing wagons, but I phrased it poorly and was pounced on by a number of players. As I tried to clarify my comments, I seemed to be digging myself into a deeper hole which led to the quoted post. I thought the best thing I could do when I saw myself in real danger of being lynched was to try and take a step back and tell everyone that I would remove myself from the conversation. I think it's easy to draw a line between what I am doing in the quoted post with what I am doing in this game.<br><br><div align=\"center\"><hr style=\"height:14px; width:20%\"></div><a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2562564#p2562564\" class=\"postlink\">Subject: Open 226: Big Love - Game over!

From the start I never really was able to get a good feel for the game, and, not long after replacing in, two of my big scumreads flipped town. That took a blow to my self-esteem and scumhunting ability. So much so that I effectively conceded that Ythill's reads were stronger and better than anything I could come up with. I was so in the tank for Ythill that I made that second post I quoted. Again, highly emotional.

I haven't been speaking much to this subject because it's totally self-serving for me to chime in, imo, but when you're seriously bringing up Eclipse Mafia as a good comparison, I'm skeptical of your decisions. All joking aside about <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7138737#p7138737\" class=\"postlink\">how you can read me better than I can myself</a> (regardless of what happens this game, I remain impressed with the accurate nature of some of the things you said about me earlier this game), I do have to live with myself. Thus, I know a thing or two about how I act in certain situations. Eclipse Mafia in no way, shape or form is indicative of my mindset here. We're talking polar opposites because that was me at peak confidence. Let me bring up three town games which are more better indicators of where my mind is at:<br><br><fieldset style=\"border:3px outset grey; padding:5px 10px\"><a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2711036#p2711036\" class=\"postlink\">Subject: ATHF Mafia OVER(roles and whatnot revealed)</a><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>RedCoyote wrote:</cite>...Oh, wait, it wasn't podium.

As town, if I think I'm not really helping the town's chances, I turn a bit morose. I dislike being unhelpful. In this situation, I had fumbled my role results twice and didn't think it was reasonable to expect the rest of the town to still see me as genuine. Similar to this game, I see myself making one bad move (hammering town), after another (pushing Vinkah to the point where he replaces out), after another (being unable to draw a NK), after another (having to claim), after another (pursuing townOversoul), after another (effectively aiding Nacho's intent to draw a shot from implosion) after another (being unable to articulate how clear it is in my mind that Tammy's role should necessarily give you, if not total 100% comfort that my role claim is genuine, at least a strong sense of doubt in the possibility that I'm scum ... and this isn't speaking to you necessarily, ffrey, moreso to pie/ns). So the culmination of all those things gives me pains in my stomach that are only being prolonged as I feel like I see the writing on the wall going into D4. <br><br><div align=\"center\"><hr style=\"height:14px; width:20%\"></div><a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3133014#p3133014\" class=\"postlink\">Subject: DEFCON Mafia 3.0 - Over, American Victory!</a><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>RedCoyote wrote:</cite>I see your point, inHim.

Here is a situation where I was lynched on D1 after actually being seen as relatively townie most of the day. My top scumread at the time was the leading wagon and I was riding high. Late into the day, I suggested that another wagon should also get some attention so that the town may benefit further down the line from an atmosphere where there were two competing wagons, but I phrased it poorly and was pounced on by a number of players. As I tried to clarify my comments, I seemed to be digging myself into a deeper hole which led to the quoted post. I thought the best thing I could do when I saw myself in real danger of being lynched was to try and take a step back and tell everyone that I would remove myself from the conversation. I think it's easy to draw a line between what I am doing in the quoted post with what I am doing in this game.<br><br><div align=\"center\"><hr style=\"height:14px; width:20%\"></div><a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2562564#p2562564\" class=\"postlink\">Subject: Open 226: Big Love - Game over!

From the start I never really was able to get a good feel for the game, and, not long after replacing in, two of my big scumreads flipped town. That took a blow to my self-esteem and scumhunting ability. So much so that I effectively conceded that Ythill's reads were stronger and better than anything I could come up with. I was so in the tank for Ythill that I made that second post I quoted. Again, highly emotional.

It was obvious that one of {Nacho, Oversoul} was going to get lynched and even though I suspected Nacho more throughout the course of yesterday, I'll admit I wouldn't be angry about my second top suspect getting lynched instead.

If I wanted to give an actually accurate answer to this question I'd need to look at the end of day one, but I'm not entirely sure if that would even be accurate because I have no idea what my mindset would be going into a game like this as a serial killer.<br><br>With regards to RC. The first thing to discuss is his claim. He's been falling back a lot upon the laurel that the rolecop confirms his role, i.e. the existence of a rolecop should make his role more reasonable to exist. While this is not strictly true, it is somewhat true that a rolecop makes more sense with a miller in the game. Jailkeeper isn't a particularly useful role to find because it can easily be scum; vig is a role that confirms itself anyway. There isn't a whole lot of utility for a rolecop in this game with only vanilla townies alive other than myself, even if there's some scum who gives a positive. <br><br>Next there's the claim itself, i.e. the whole \"i'm not a vt\" debacle. That way of claiming just adds obstacles as scum - if he gets lynched that day, he has to explain why he wasn't nightkilled or why nothing else strange happened because he's obviously going to claim that he was trying to draw a nightkill. <br><br>His Vinkah/OS tunnel comprises literally the entirety of his d3. It's either town who was just caught in what turned out to be a bad tunnel, or scum resting on their laurels. I guess he could have been trying to defend Nacho from being the next likely lynch target but I don't feel like defending Nacho would be super high priority for the scum at that point. I think the tunnel seems more likely from town given that he had a very detailed case at the start of the day - I can see it as very reasonable for town to have tunneled that deeply, but I think RC-scum would have given himself at least some outs. If OS is lynched and flips town of course that makes RC look bad. If Nacho were lynched and flipped scum, that would also make him look bad even though he'd been putting some suspicion on Nacho because he'd been tunneling the other wagon so hard. It just doesn't make that much sense. <br><br>Another thing that pinged town was the series of posts from <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7156198#p7156198\">2124</a>-2130. The emotion felt genuine to me and it did feel to me like that particular series of posts made him look like very clear town at least at face value, so 2129 in particular felt genuine to me. The posts after that where he's mocking OS about his miller claim too. His overall attitude in that exchange just feels like it comes from town."}

So you trying to push that oh my god you're town and people should be able to see it after it is disingenuous as fuck.<br><br>Second, no, Tammy did not \"blow what you say way out of proportion\", and you pushing that she did reads like blatant manipulation.  In the first place, you shouldn't have thought her being a non-factor in this game was a reason to be concerned about her here.  And then when she asked you about it, you didn't answer it.  But, regardless, her being concerned about you claiming she doesn't setup spec did not, in fact, have to do with how she plays on a general level.  I think she was pretty obviously concerned because you had missed her setup spec'ing in this game, multiple times, since practically the very start of the game.  The logic there is consistent; and even if you just happened to miss it, it is perfectly reasonable that someone would find that hard to believe.<br><br>I also refuse to believe you make <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7140868#p7140868\">1839</a> after the whole claimgate after she got paranoid she'd get lynched.  At that point, she was really fucking obviously town and I am 100% sure you should have been able to recognize it by then.  You acting unsure about her, or like she could potentially be \"scum manipulating her meta\" entirely ignores everything about how it actually played out and it reads like you're blatantly acting here.  The only reason she even brought it up was because YOU hadn't noticed where she had setup spec'd before; so claiming it could be her manipulating her meta after the fact is fucking awful.  And if you *were* concerned that that was she was doing, why didn't you just ... ask her about it?  I don't see you actually asking her anything to work out what your read on her actually is, and when she tried to ask you to elaborate on what was giving you reservations about her here, you kept ignoring it and saying stuff like \"I'm not sure so I don't see why it's a big deal\".  And when she asked you why you thought she'd specifically go out of her way to tailor her meta to you as opposed to other people in the game, we got ... nothing.  So how the hell were you trying to \"work with her\" here?<br><br>This is why I don't see a town approach in the way you played this.  In fact, it read like you were specifically trying to find something to comment on in order to look like you had a point here.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7150819#p7150819\" class=\"postlink\">post 1890</a>, fferyllt wrote:</cite>What posts of notsci's are you talking about here?</div></blockquote><br>I hated <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7140816#p7140816\">1825</a>/<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7140879#p7140879\">1842</a>.

I only had like an hour-hour and a half to post/read this game before I left and this isn't the only game I need to give attention (there's a few other games on this site/offsite that I need to remain caught up in), and even that was on/off because we're in the middle of moving a house and there's a lot of random shit my parents call me for.  So, given the time I had, I hardly had any time to actually sit down, read the game in-depth, and do stuff.  Most of when I actually have a hard block of time to read/make actual cases in games comes really really late at night.  The majority of what I read, not counting Nacho's posts, was RC and implo posting what looked like ridiculous reasons for Oversoul being scum here.  Based on the fact I had other shit I needed to do, the only thing I could really say was that the Oversoul wagon was awful; I didn't really have a chance to sit down and make an actual case on why the way Oversoul played this wasn't coming from scum or why, specifically, I think Nacho is trying to push a counterwagon here.  So yeah, it is an activity-related reason.<br><br>I was already really on edge because notsci's approach this game day has essentially amounted to repeating that I'm scum over and over without any logical reason for it.  Which, in addition to being the exact same fucking shit Nacho pulled in the last game where he was scum against me and got me mislynched (and he's doing the same fucking thing again here, he's just being a lot more low-key about it and doesn't have me as his primary read), is just a really stupid scum strategy (and is something I've seen a lot of recently from people like MS and Titus) and something I wish people would stop doing entirely because it takes all the enjoyment out of the game for me.  It essentially reduces the game to whoever is more active and is best able to outyell everyone else; which, in the first place, is not something I'm capable of doing in my current position RL-wise (the fact that Nacho was able to walk in here and flood the thread with posts to push the Oversoul wagon is testimony to this), but it's not fun at all.<br><br>I also saw more similar posts coming from him - as one example, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7159849#p7159849\">2355</a>.  I have no idea how people *ever* read posts like this and think it's coming from anything *but* an overdefensive-scum mindset.  This is the kind of shit people like BRO always pull as scum (which he did in the last game I had with him and I correctly called him out on it) and I have no idea how it apparently continues to work every game despite it being transparent as fuck.<br><br>The other thing that has me really on edge here is that I think it's really fairly fucking obvious I'm town here if you read the end of D2; there is literally no reason I would have played it the way I did as scum unless I'm scum with RC.  And, SURPRISE, both notsci and Nacho are trying to act entirely like that point doesn't exist.  They don't have any counterargument for it, so they just attempt to mist over it and justify it with \"lol, ur better at logic than me\", never mind the fact it's entirely objective and it should really be fucking straightforward to explain any sort of reason I would have done it as scum.<br><br>I am sorry if my reaction was overblown.  At that point, I had been watching the thread for  about half an hour, but hadn't been able to post because I was playing a game with some of my other friends and so I couldn't actually type a response to anything - and then I kept seeing him trying to push more and more blatantly false reasons for me being scum here.  Then he tried to claim that it was scummy that I wasn't \"derailing the Oversoul wagon\" (when I had done basically all I could given the time I had for the game) and I lost all interest in being civil here.  It didn't remotely help that in another recent game I played I was in a similar position RL-wise and had people pushing that I was scum for \"avoiding the thread\", and felt for a majority of the game until I *actually* had more time to do anything to begin with and was able to post a bunch of analysis that no one would town read me or be willing to pay attention to anything I was writing that game.<br><br>Lastly, I am taking Nacho seeing this and still scum reading me as a hard scum claim (if his push on ffery wasn't enough of one already).  And notsci attempting to double down after seeing this is entirely bullshit.  I'm nowhere near an emotionally manipulative player as scum, and he knows this about me (Nacho correctly pointed this out in the last game we played).<br><br>If anyone has any questions, don't hesitate to ask.  I'll write about Oversoul and probably some other stuff in a separate post, but this might not come tonight since I don't remotely feel like doing anything intensive right now.</div></blockquote><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7160515#p7160515\" class=\"postlink\">post 2446</a>, pieguyn wrote:</cite>Like, seriously, notsci.<br><br>You're claiming that \"no one wants pie to be town more than me\" yet you were just saying stuff like \"I'm not getting in any argument with you\".<br><br>Where in here was I ever supposed to get the impression you wanted to work with me here?<br><br>Like at this point, especially, you should really, really know this isn't coming from scum-me and I have literally no idea why you possibly think it could.<br><br>When I said \"activity\", I meant that I literally could not have done anything more to derail the wagon given the time I had.

If I wanted to give an actually accurate answer to this question I'd need to look at the end of day one, but I'm not entirely sure if that would even be accurate because I have no idea what my mindset would be going into a game like this as a serial killer.<br><br>With regards to RC. The first thing to discuss is his claim. He's been falling back a lot upon the laurel that the rolecop confirms his role, i.e. the existence of a rolecop should make his role more reasonable to exist. While this is not strictly true, it is somewhat true that a rolecop makes more sense with a miller in the game. Jailkeeper isn't a particularly useful role to find because it can easily be scum; vig is a role that confirms itself anyway. There isn't a whole lot of utility for a rolecop in this game with only vanilla townies alive other than myself, even if there's some scum who gives a positive. <br><br>Next there's the claim itself, i.e. the whole \"i'm not a vt\" debacle. That way of claiming just adds obstacles as scum - if he gets lynched that day, he has to explain why he wasn't nightkilled or why nothing else strange happened because he's obviously going to claim that he was trying to draw a nightkill. <br><br>His Vinkah/OS tunnel comprises literally the entirety of his d3. It's either town who was just caught in what turned out to be a bad tunnel, or scum resting on their laurels. I guess he could have been trying to defend Nacho from being the next likely lynch target but I don't feel like defending Nacho would be super high priority for the scum at that point. I think the tunnel seems more likely from town given that he had a very detailed case at the start of the day - I can see it as very reasonable for town to have tunneled that deeply, but I think RC-scum would have given himself at least some outs. If OS is lynched and flips town of course that makes RC look bad. If Nacho were lynched and flipped scum, that would also make him look bad even though he'd been putting some suspicion on Nacho because he'd been tunneling the other wagon so hard. It just doesn't make that much sense. <br><br>Another thing that pinged town was the series of posts from <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7156198#p7156198\">2124</a>-2130. The emotion felt genuine to me and it did feel to me like that particular series of posts made him look like very clear town at least at face value, so 2129 in particular felt genuine to me. The posts after that where he's mocking OS about his miller claim too. His overall attitude in that exchange just feels like it comes from town.</div></blockquote><br><br>The point of  a rolecop over a traditional cop is that a rolecop doenst make or break you unless you lied/have a blatantly scum role. Yes, miller makes a lot of sense given it,  but I think its more likely a check for the vig/sk chance and the one scum.<br><br>Two, I think the claiming \"not a vt\" thing is something either alignment would do, and I'm pretty sure that there were a LOT of people pushing oversoul about the way he did it too. It is just massive wifom. <br><br>Three, if he just stopped his oversoul push when the going got rough on Nacho it would draw all sorts of weird looks. Did you see how hard nacho was fighting to have oversoul get lynched? How he repeatedly said to just let PRs sort it out? The reason he was pushing it so hard was likely to keep you from shooting another one of his buddies down the road (see, the current debacle we're in: if you still had a shot, we could lynch RC, if he flips town you can shoot wicked and that leaves one scum left in 3p lylo). I frankly don't see a way that scum-RC could have gotten out of that vote, given how opportunistic it felt coming into that day, an opportunistic abandoning would just make it worse. <br><br>I kinda see your point about those random posts, but I really kinda hate the way he has treated my slot all game.<br><br>So idk.<br><br>pedit-<br><br>Because he crumbed it earlier? Because he could have (like ffery just said) had a gf on his team and been anticipating a traditional cop? He claimed after you. Your slot is a WAY higher priority for a potential cop than he was."}

It's essentially a low-risk play that distances them from each other and allows them to display a town-ish level of conviction that can't be discredited (because they're both correct in scum reading each other) nor can it anger an opponent (because they're attacking each other). This works as long as they are good enough to execute - and I think they <span style=\"font-style: italic\">are</span> both good enough to do this. At first, I thought they were both town so the exchange was weird, but I didn't think that it could be bussing. I have a blind spot for bussing and it didn't occur to me that I was overlooking the possibility until Oversoul/implosion flipped town/not-mafia. If I had town read one and scum read the other, then my town read on the former would have strengthened greatly from this. For context, note that notscience almost got lynched the day beforehand, pie wasn't part of that bandwagon, and pie wasn't ever the popular townread that you or Tammy were. <br><br>Nacho bus... doesn't give me any reason to doubt that one or both of them are scum.

Talk about sapping someone's energy to finish the game out.<br><br>But, it's like, I don't really think I'm a bad lynch from the perspective of which player looks the most scummy. Even in games I play well it's often said that I come across very scummy (ask Tammy). That's something that has plagued me throughout my Mafia career. I guess I'm just making this post because I don't want to give off the vibe that I am just sitting here waiting for the inevitable. I literally don't know what else I could do to make lynching someone else more palatable. I don't think the answer lies in massive walls that go back over the post history. I certainly don't think the answer lies in VCA given the players that are still living."}

I hadn't played with him, but I knew he had a reputable scum game. I'm usually cautious in reading experienced players with strong scum games, but I could tell pretty quickly that he was town in that game. Next to Tammy, he might have been my strongest read in that game just because he felt <span style=\"font-style: italic\">so</span> genuine. I <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">never</span> got that same feeling from his early play in this game. <br><br>I reached a point where I couldn't really do anything with (a) and I was worried that (b) might just be an experience change - swag town was two years ago I think. I also thought that his below-average effort + strange attitude would be town tells for him given his preference for scum. In retrospect, these 'tells' could be things he knows to exploit given his experience with everyone in this game and also considering his partner Nacho was the one designated to read him. <br><br><br>Fastforward to the end of day 2 where he claimed miller. I ended up town reading him for this (because it seemed like a bizarre move to make as scum), but, as I explained before, the crumb was an awful decision for him if he was actually a town miller. In retrospect, I should have been more skeptical and more open-minded than to immediately assume 'too scummy to be scum'. <br><br><br>On days 3 and 4, RC felt genuinely sick of this game but this was still a side of him unfamiliar to me. I guess I misread it completely. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif\" alt=\":neutral:\" title=\"Neutral\">  <br><br><br>Today I know he's scum and I honestly think he didn't realize it was 1v1 (which is probably a scum tell too)."}
