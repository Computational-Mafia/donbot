The site-wide rules apply. Read them, know them, love them, do not break them.<br>\n2. Play to win.<br>\n3. Do not edit or delete your posts in this thread. If there is a problem with a post, such as incorrect formatting, ask me to fix it for you.<br>\n4. Do not quote communications outside the game thread, including role PMs, quicktopics, etc., in the game thread. This specifically includes PM timestamps. Paraphrasing is allowed. If in doubt, ask.<br>\n5. Do not use cryptography, invisible text, tiny text, or the like.<br>\n6. Do not use any form of provable randomness. Claiming you rolled dice and acting on that is fine. Using dice tags is not.<br>\n7. Do not impersonate or pretend to be the moderator. If I edit a post, I will use <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#0000FF\">this color</div></div>. Do not use this color.<br>\n8. Unless the moderator has specifically told you it is allowed, do not talk about this game outside of this game thread until it is completed.<br>\n9. Do not bring outside factors into this game. This includes, among other things, making bets, promises of real life rewards, etc.<br>\n10. Claiming scum by yourself is fine. Claiming scum with others is not, regardless of the truth of this claim.<br>\n11. Pretending to break a rule will be treated the same as breaking the rule.<br>\n12. We're all here to have fun. Tempers may flare, but avoid personal attacks and keep it civil.<br>\n13. Breaking one of these rules may, at my discretion, result in a modkill. If you are modkilled, you will become a Neutral Survivor, and thus automatically lose. Modkilling may or may not end the game day.<br>\n14. I reserve the right to change the rules. Rule changes will be posted in thread.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Activity Rules</div><br>\n1. If a player goes two days (48 real life hours) without posting, they may be prodded at my discretion, or upon being asked by another player. Prods will be announced in thread.<br>\n2. If a player does not respond to their prod within one day (24 real life hours), is prodded three times in the same game-day, or five times in total within the game, they may be force-replaced at my discretion.<br>\n3. If you will be V/LA, please alert me in the thread or via PM.<br>\n4. Each game day will have a deadline of two weeks (14 real life days).<br>\n5. In the event deadline is reached before a lynch has occurred, there will be No Lynch.<br>\n6. Each night will have a deadline of two days (48 hours).<br>\n7. If a player has a night action, but does not submit a choice before deadline, they will perform no action.<br>\n8. I may extend deadlines in the event replacements must be found, at my discretion. This will be announced in thread.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Voting Rules</div><br>\n1. Votes must be at the beginning of a new line and bolded, and in the format of <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">VOTE: Player name</div> or <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Playername</span>. Abbreviations, missing punctuation, and misspellings will be accepted as long as it is obvious to me who is being voted for. If I perceive it as a vote, it counts as a vote.<br>\n2. Unvoting is nice, but is not necessary.<br>\n3. Once a majority of votes is reached (# of players / 2 + 1, rounded down), that person is lynched.<br>\n4. All living players, including the lynchee, may continue to post until I lock the thread.<br>\n5. If you are dead, that is it. Do not post. Not even a \"Bah\" post.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Setup Rules</div><br>\n1. At least 1 player will get the Vanilla Townie role PM, which looks like this:<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Welcome to Mini 1699, [Player]! You are a <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#004000\">Vanilla Townie</div></div>.<br>\n<br>\nAbilities:<br>\n- You have none aside from your voice and your vote.<br>\n<br>\nWin Condition:<br>\n- You win when all threats to the town have been eliminated and there is at least one town-aligned player alive.<br>\n<br>\nPlease confirm via PM stating your role and your alignment.</div></blockquote>", "time": "Wed Jul 15, 2015 5:18 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=62686&start=0", "forum": "53", "thread": "62686"}

It feels like coaching and I will never get the answers I want. I don't see it as being stubborn. But I am stubborn, sure. I can't say I know what you're asking in the second part. I'll tell you what I was doing, so maybe you know what my intention was. I found her opening very manipulative. In a way that scum would immediately try and buddy a good player. After my post, people started questioning my post, which is fine. But then Layla answered on Tammy's behalf. So I decided to push further, to see what would happen. Then Nacho joined in on the replying. So I'm now really interested in knowing why I can't question Tammy's motives behind that post. Now she is following Nacho's reads, but apparently isn't townreading Nacho. So I think my vote is still good. That's how things went in my head at least. Not sure if you can follow my thought process there.", "time": "Sun Jul 19, 2015 6:31 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=62686&start=350", "forum": "53", "thread": "62686"}

I'm including them for completeness, but I would never expect her to play like this in a not-newbie game.

Early game you seemed concerned that I was faking not knowing the setup.  You also originally thought it was odd that I focused a lot on me, but then you reread my iso and realized that in the context of the conversations happening in real time that it made sense.  I thought that looked town of you because you could have easily thrown suspicion on me for faking not knowing the set up.

You're the one who jumped to people suspecting you, including me, for reputation purposes.  <br>\n<br>\nBut it's interesting that you're trying to claim this isn't my town game while simultaneously just comparing it to S&amp;V. <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>cheetory wrote:</cite><br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Tammy wrote:</cite>I'm also feeling a bit squicky about the whole, how dare people make Poe lists before page ten, and tammy doesn't usually do that.

Because I don't think for one second that you think that every time I have a scum read I post a bunch of questions about them and I completely believe that you know that I'll talk about my scum reads the exact way I have here.<br>\n<br>\nYou're also comparing apples to oranges and for someone who wants for people to understand that signs and void isn't the end all be all you're doing a fair bit of this yourself, while also not actually asking me questions about this.<br>\n<br>\nSOOOOOOOOO.  Empire is a real life friend and we hydra together.  Zar used to be a \"friend\" and we knew each other before playing mafia and started playing mafia together at my home site, westeros.  Espeonage and I have several games of experience together, have been scum partners and have hydrad together.<br>\n<br>\nAs far as Empire/Zar goes.  It was team mafia.  I knew that empire was excited to play team mafia.  He was also on a team with Regfan.  I had certain expectations for their team interaction in that I expected that both empire and regfan would have thoughts on the game and that they would have told Zar to share their thoughts.  So when Zar wasn't showing any indication that their teammates were reading the game, while iirc his other teammates were in their games, I got suspicious.  Instead of answer my questions in a way that would be conducive to the game Zar decided to be a bit insulting (not exactly the right word).  That made no sense to me, but hey I thought quite highly of Zar until that game and reading the westeros qt, so I didn't think a town him would behave that way and instead did what he did because he was scum.<br>\n<br>\nEspeonage kept attacking me for the mind-numbingly stupidest stuff.  I thought he was probably town and that his attacks were personal because they made no sense whatsoever with the way he was going about it.  I replaced out.<br>\n<br>\nSo, what's comparable to here? This is early game, you don't have a lot of content, I don't know you so I wouldn't know exactly what to prod you about, and I'm giving impressions of the people in this game and what my concerns are.  I feel off to a pretty good start here and actually am more engaged in the first 10 pages of a game than I normally am, so.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>cheetory wrote:</cite><br>\nLike. To me, it seems a lot like you're trying to set up a scumread on me so you have options, rather than actually trying to figure me out and all of this \"these things make me feel weird but Iunno\" feels like a weird amount of uncertainty to be throwing around while you're not even really trying to engage me on things. Are you just kind of hoping I'll sort myself out? Because this passive scumhunting feels off, especially since I have already poked at you and in response you've just kind of flopped semi-angrily at me.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nThis feels disingenuous because I don't think that you would think it's scummy that I would talk about things I'm concerned about early without doing a lot of questioning.  <br>\n<br>\nI'm pretty amused at the weird amount of uncertainty to be throwing at me when it's pretty standard.  Like people have tried to get me a waffle title for over a year now because how much uncertainty is a part of my play style.  I weigh everything and what everything could potentially mean.  That's me trying to figure things out, which is funny because you say I'm not doing that.  As scum, I always have options.  I don't have to set up a scum read on you.  As scum, I could easily call you town and change my mind a few pages later.  <br>\n<br>\nYou're using incorrect meta on me while claiming that it's not right/fair that people are using signs and voids, which also using signs and voids to put suspicion on me.  And yes, I do want you to sort yourself out.  How I read people is quite often how they read/interact with the game.  I poke at things as I think they're going to help me.  I'm not going to force myself to ask things just to do it.  I know when things are off in my town game, but there's not anything off in my game and I feel pretty strong here, so I'm really not sure what you're seeing.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>cheetory wrote:</cite><br>\nI also kind of feel like your angry responses to people feel too strong. Where your angry response to Zar felt like it made sense in the context, you being angry at Layla felt a lot like an unreasonably angry reaction to her asking you why you hadn&#8217;t used your vote. Especially since the way she was asking you about it felt entirely reasonable to me.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nPart of this response is a response to the above point.  Yeah, you guys are annoying because you're not reading.  You dismissed my concerns about you before I even talked about it with something like reputation and gave incorrect meta on me.  (IE do I or don't I give a suspect pool, which yes, I do.  And even though I as a matter of course don't do reads lists, I sometimes even do those!)  It also indicated that you weren't reading, and this is my major problem with Layla.  I literally said I was headed out the door unexpectedly and would finish my post later.  I quickly gave the people I was concerned about both to remind myself what I was thinking at the time of reading the post and to get some early thoughts out there so people could see where I was.<br>\n<br>\nAfter I posted that I had to leave unexpectedly, Layla made the comment about the vote and asked me to explain my concerns about you, which indicated that she didn't read my post completely or missed that I didn't finish because I left.  You did a similar thing in which you dismissed my thoughts before I could even finish.  <br>\n<br>\nI wasn't angry when I posted Saturday afternoon about people not recognizing that I left before finishing my thoughts, slightly annoyed because I wish people would read, but hey people miss things.  I said I'd give more thoughts and clarified that in the middle of making a post I got a text message and left.  I thought that was clear.<br>\n<br>\nShe came back to point out that she was calling me out and then told me to respond to her other post.  While quoting my post in which I said that I had other things to talk about and would later, and clarified that I got a text message mid post and left.  That's annoying.  I would expect anyone who was actually reading and actually trying to figure things out, when it's clarified that that \"I unexpectedly have to walk out the door, this was supposed to be more insightful.  It will have to wait until tomorrow.\" was that I literally left mid-post that the response wouldn't be a stubborn blowback of \"oh I was calling you out blah blah bla\".  What I would expect from town would be, ah I didn't catch that, because to me if her big suspicion of me was that I didn't change my vote my response that I left mid thought would answer for that. <br>\n<br>\nIt's irksome.  Now if she wanted to claim that I was lying about leaving and I just was too afraid to finish my thoughts and put a different vote down, then hey okay.  I'd probably be more perturbed at the stupidity of that, but at least it would indicate that she'd actually read my posts.  Talking to a brick wall is not fun at all, and quite frankly that kind of thing makes me worry about scum posturing, like she can't possibly go \"ah you left, okay I'll see what you do\" because that might make her look like she's backing down or something.  I don't know how much I believe this, but a brick wall is a brick wall and it's annoying.<br>\n<br>\nAnd what she wanted me to do was vote for aneninen whom I don't even know if I want to vote for.  I don't know who I want to vote for, so the call out for a vote would have been met with a meh regardless, but I hate when people don't read my posts when they're going to call me out or suspect me or at least acknowledge when they misunderstood or missed something.", "time": "Sun Jul 19, 2015 4:33 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=62686&start=375", "forum": "53", "thread": "62686"}

I think he's a bit more image conscious as scum, so I'm not sure he'd start out the way he has a scum?  That doesn't feel super strong and I was interested in how he comes back.  I do think he's starting to get on edge about some playstyles/behaviors that he thinks are detrimental or disrespectful to the game lately and maybe that's where the policy lynch idea has come from?

Recognizing other people's strengths and your weaknesses is one of the means to gaining the trust that you need to work with your town reads.  (I also think it's important to at least hear/listen to your scum reads because you might be wrong on those.)<br>\n<br>\nI reached out to implosion because I haven't played with him in something like a year.  I don't have a lot of experience with him, but I've enjoyed playing with him.  In the last couple games we've played we town read each other pretty early, and in fact in both he was my first real town read.  When empire told me the game was in signups, I thought to myself that I hoped that implosion would sign up.<br>\n<br>\nI reached out to nacho, well because I often do.  Nacho and I are rarely rarely town together and although we both can read each other based on other things we've been able to read each other best (or at least I have) based on how we interact with each other.  That interaction has changed somewhat over the past few months, which has made getting or feeling confident in reads on each other a bit more difficult.  That has been a failing on my part, and I'd rather not have silly paranoia on each other like we did in forest fire.  Therefore, I'm going to try to be more open.  Because if we're both town, I'd like us both the figure that out sooner rather than be paranoid about it.<br>\n<br>\nSo yeah, Nacho is one of the sounding boards I would want to work with in the game.  I'd listen to his reads even if I thought he was scum here because even as scum how he presents his reads and why can say something about the other person.  He's not the only sounding board or person I want to work with in this game, and although if I were scum I'd be attempting to manipulate Nacho, it would not be the way I went about it in my first post.  I'm not even sure if I would have thought to make that post in that way as scum and I don't think even if I thought of it that I actually would.<br>\n<br>\nSpeaking of, I was hoping Nacho would post today.", "time": "Sun Jul 19, 2015 5:56 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=62686&start=375", "forum": "53", "thread": "62686"}

It was nightless and the \"Head of Household\" nominated two people for eviction and then during the night phase all the players except the head of household voted privately to remove one of the nominees.  The scum team had a couple daykills.

I don't see the way he's pushing the Tammy read here coming from scum.  there are a few things that specifically made me think this that I can't think of right now OTOH, but on a general level, I get the impression he believes most of what he's saying, and a lot of it makes a lot more sense as town not understanding why the entire game is jumping down his throat for what he thought was an innocuous read as opposed to scum attempting to force a read for whatever reason.  I think scum would be more likely to want to drop this kind of read entirely instead of essentially continuing to go \"nup, fuck you\" like he's doing here.<br>\n<br>\nfrom what I could tell, Cheetory's push on Tammy was almost entirely semantic.

I also don't really get why he would have expected Gnomeo to be aware of how Tammy opens games (re: the first question).<br>\n<br>\nI feel better about Nacho based on his recent posts.  I still don't *really* want to elaborate on what first pinged me re: him bc I'm not remotely sure about this, but he's done a much better job hitting the notes I was originally looking for in his opening posts.  his thoughts on the recent situation re: Gnomeo/Cheetory also lined up with mine fairly well, which is a bonus.<br>\n<br>\nnotsci alluded to me being able to read him earlier.

I have an early inkling that he's town, but I'm well aware of my failings at reading him.  Nacho didn't show concern about his opening, so I'm not going to.  Beyond that, I'm not really going to go into all the whys of why I'd take a null read into account on RC as I feel like anyone with much experience with mafia knows the benefits to watching how someone's reads develop.<br>\n<br>\nI also know that a town!Nacho could be misreading a scum!Red Coyote early so even if I had a town read on Nacho, I'd still be looking at RC but using Nacho's read to balance out my own.  <br>\n<br>\nIf I know that someone is good at reading someone else, I always take that into account.

I disagree with both of these points, but I think both of them are entirely reasonable.  the first one essentially amounts to a playstyle difference: he doesn't see why someone would sheep someone else's read unless they were town reading them.  I buy that he thought Tammy was just \"following\" Nacho's read (the post this came from was <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7065164#p7065164\">176</a>, and I think it's a reasonable interpretation of it keeping in mind he missed <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7063949#p7063949\">148</a>), and from there, it makes sense he would assume she was town reading Nacho.<br>\n<br>\nI think a lot of his posts make a lot more sense with this in mind.  the logic he's pushing is consistent.  there was nothing town in Nacho's opening posts - and if he thought Tammy was attempting to manipulate Nacho, it would have been correct to call bullshit on what he perceived as Tammy town reading him.<br>\n<br>\nthe second one I think in particular explains a lot of why he wasn't interested in people with meta experience with Tammy telling him he was wrong.  he thinks he caught Tammy BS'ing a read on Nacho in order to manipulate him, which would be a strong point if it was correct.  thus, he doesn't want to drop it unless he's sure that's not what she's doing.  he doesn't care about people's meta experience with Tammy because it's entirely unrelated to what his point actually was (that Tammy had town read Nacho before it would have made any sense to).  keeping this in mind, I don't *really* mind his attitude here - it comes off similarly to, for instance, someone getting pissed off on principle because someone else stepped into their line of questioning, which is a perfectly fine attitude to have.  it might make sense as scum stretching to justify a fake read, but I don't think by any means it's explicitly *more* likely to come from scum.<br>\n<br>\nin general, I think most of the reasoning he's pushing here happened as a result of him misunderstanding Tammy's posts as opposed to any scum-motivated reason.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7068963#p7068963\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7068963#p7068963\" data-post-id=\"7068963\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 368</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=21946\">Gnomeo</a> wrote:</cite>awww.

That wouldn't be a strong thing to point out <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">now</div> &#8211; that was just an early impression. <br>\n<br>\nBut,<br>\nI don't think anyone really cares about my posts at all.<br>\nIf I'm here and answer things = I'm called scum.<br>\nIf I'm away for RL reasons and don't do anything = I'm called scum.<br>\n<br>\nI've seen games like this when someone gets called scum regardless of everything. Sadly said, I even joined wagons like that as town. But, at that point I strongly think staying alive wouldn't help the town at all.<br>\nAs long as I'm alive I'll be an easy lynch for the scums. (Unless someone throws an investigation on me.)<br>\nHowever, after my flip there will be a lot of information on certain players. As a start, I'd like to point out that in the last couple of pages there has been a lot of talk, but players have been voting only for me.<br>\n<br>\nHere's what I think.<br>\n<br>\nMy wagon has been pushed as a counter or because of a Chainsaw, or an OMGUS.<br>\nIf the previous one, Fferyllt must be scum. A year ago, in another game she replaced in and at that time I'd been wagoned. (It rarely happens to me as town on Day1 but that was another example.) She derailed my wagon becasue he thought \"it was clear that the town was on its way to a mislynch.) My gamestart was <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">very</div> similar to that game. (Yes, I did it intentionally.) Why hasn't she realized the same thing?<br>\nIf I'm wrong about this, my next guess is RedCoyote. <br>\n<br>\nImplosion is a next guess. In his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7065779#p7065779\">198</a> he expressed this: <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">\"In fact, there are at least *seven* people who have either voted you or expressed suspicion! You know for a fact that many of them must be town, and townies expressing suspicion towards you are doing so for genuine (if possibly not correct) reasons.\"</div> This is a reasoning I know <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">very well</div> from IRL situations (not games, real situations!) &#8211; it shows evil intent which has a clear goal: wipe someone out of a complany/workplace/community/etc. (Implosion: I'm not calling you evil; it's a game and I've done things like this before too.)<br>\nOne more thing about him: he was the first one on my wagon but he left it later. I can easily imagine a scum pushing a wagon but leaving it so as not to get found on a mislynch later.<br>\n<br>\nThe third one could be amongst Nachomamma/Tammy or maybe Cheetory. Late-wagon-joins and/or shadowing.

The read seems genuine. I don't like that he's expressed suspicion of Layla for her inactivity, but everything else I've seen from him looks good. <br>\n<br>\n-I recently realized that Layla is probably an alt. Layla, am I right? Can't say why I think that at this time, but it would mean she is more capable of exhibiting the early game town tells than most other \"Goon\" players. This revelation + the lack of any recent town telling put her in neutral territory for me right now.<br>\n<br>\n-It feels like Vinkah has been coasting. In particular, page 22 feels like him facilitating conversation from the backseat rather than contributing to it on his own. Vinkah, what are your thoughts right now?<br>\n<br>\n-Regardless of Anen's alignment, I don't like Cheetory's vote for him - it feels opportunistic. In particular, I have issue with his first point;<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Cheetory wrote:</cite>i) This is more of a confusion thing than something scummy, <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">but I find it strange that Anen goes on and on about how scummy people's OMGUSing is at the start of the game</div> and by the end of his ISO he's literally blanket OMGUSing his entire wagon composition. I just don't really understand how that works. Lol.</div></blockquote><br>\nThe bolded comment is just a blatant exaggeration. I don't know why Cheetory would exaggerate this, if he's town. Is it the comfort of attacking a popular scum read? The safety of targeting a partner? Or just scum not reading carefully?

Is he known to be so self-deprecating as scum? We've played a couple of times, and I never got that impression. Cheetory, I think, would be far more bullish as scum.

It felt that way because his opening case against Tammy seemed like a push but didn't really have good reasoning to back it up, and as soon as he was challenged on the case, it seemed like he was immediately looking to back off from it.<br>\n<br>\nI find that less likely now because it just seems like an element of his playstyle, like maybe he has trouble wording things at first or tends to have an in the moment emotional response to something before bringing out a much more sensible action later; his recent exchange with Wicked seems to exemplify that almost perfectly (the argument of implied OMGUS or whatever was really really terrible but attacking Wicked for caring about this post in particular was much better).

Team mafia was a lot of fun and most players brought their best play to the games.  I'd play again.  But, I wouldn't assume that the best team will win next time either.

I see where you are coming from, and I can appreciate that you're trying to go in a new direction in light of the two flips, but I hate how predictable players in this game are sometimes. <br>\n<br>\n1) Of course I was uncertain. I thought the Ane lynch was a reasonable one. I wasn't convinced he'd flip scum. I mean, odds are the players we lynch will flip town. That's always the case.<br>\n2) I sometimes have to wonder if, as town, I need to just start being as dishonest as I am as scum. I mean, Wicked, you're essentially telling me to not be straight with you. You know what I think is straight? Telling people that a D1 lynch where you get no claims other than one VT, lynching said VT, and having them flip VT is a pretty good result for the town. That's sensible. It's not ideal, no, but that's a pretty good outcome, all things considered. Every time I find myself in a position to say that (it doesn't happen every game due to themes, early claims, early hammers, individual reads, etc), it's inevitable someone comes after me for that with some version of that same line. <br>\n<br>\n...and because of all this, I like pie's <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7105295#p7105295\">785</a> a lot.<br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\nGoing back in time a bit...<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7088966#p7088966\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7088966#p7088966\" data-post-id=\"7088966\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 683</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=26266\">Vinkah</a> wrote:</cite>okay.  i really don't know where to push outside Anen at the moment and it is absolutely scaring the shit out of me.  the longer this day is proceeding the less my townreads are staying firm.  and its nothing more than paranoia.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Vinkah</span><br>\n<br>\nA lot of people have used similar lines, but I don't like Vinkah's.

I mean, I can think of a few better ones, but it wasn't horrible. Perhaps he was on the right track scumhunting wise? I would not automatically assume that he wasn't a mafia shot. I would need to see something more substantial (e.g. multiple kills/role cop/no kill/etc).<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nSee, I don't see it this way.  When I was thinking about the game state over night and who we'd likely be without, Gnomeo was one person I was convinced would be alive.  He might have had no votes on him, but he wasn't even close to being universally town read.  Now Pie might have made a town case on him, but the entire game wasn't going to just take that town case without reading him themselves and there were some meta inquiries near the end of day one.  I was beginning to suspect him based on his single-minded questioning of my entrance and not much else/miscontruing or misinterpreting things I said.  I thought it was looking like easy contribution for him to ignore the rest of the game, so he was definitely someone I was going to look into more coming into today.  From what I remember I was his sole scum target for day one and even though he started thinking I was town, I don't think he ever moved his vote off of me, so he can't have been killed for being on the right track, and I can't imagine a scum team in this player list making a kill to frame me knowing I'm innocent.<br>\n<br>\nPerhaps it was a low information kill or a kill meant to ignite paranoia amongst the stronger town read group, but see those types of things are what it going to send me into squinty-eyed paranoia on people.

I'll relatively rarely go out of my way to do single posts or actions that are supposed to be dropping towntells (as Nacho's post would be if he's scum), or actively stop to think to myself \"hm, what would I be thinking here if I were town.\" I take a more natural approach of mostly genuinely scumhunting from the pool of players and modifying my reads as minimally as possible from what I think my reads would genuinely be if I were town. Because of that I can replicate a genuine thought process decently well as scum. Obviously I do modify what my reads would be somewhat (I might be more willing to join an advantageous wagon, etc) but the reasoning behind my reads and the general flow of my play mostly comes from a genuine place. I might project that on to other players or see it as relatively unlikely that they'll make out-of-the-way posts like that because I don't tend to.<br>\n<br>\nHow familiar are you with my play?

You also said you were giving ffery a pass for what looked like \"slow playing\" *because* of how hard it was to get strong reads in this game.  So, why is it such a problem that ... surprise ... I don't have any strong scum reads?  Just because I'm not death tunneling someone or making any particularly strong push anywhere doesn't mean I'm not forming reads or that I don't have reads.  It means that I don't see a reason to walk around acting like I've solved the game when ... I haven't.  (This idea people have of my play, btw, is part of why I wanted to play a scum game like S&amp;S2 for a while before actually being able to accomplish it; the assessment people seem to have that I hard push reads as town and aren't capable of it as scum is entirely wrong and used to interfere with my town play because people would, and still do to some extent, assume I was scum if I wasn't deathtunneling anyone.) <br>\n<br>\nThis is ignoring the fact that this isn't strictly true, either.  I've laid out my town reads in the game thread already, and I feel pretty sure all of them are town.  And I think that if you sit down and actually look what I've posted instead of attempting to read my tone, you'd see I'm pretty clearly exploring possibilities for scum outside of said town reads, even if until now I didn't have particularly strong conviction anyone was scum.<br>\n<br>\nThere's also the fact that, outside of you apparently thinking I'm scum, the people I *am* POE'ing as scum are the same as yours.  Why is it that I'm supposedly playing such an \"uncharacteristically weak\" game here if I'm in the same fucking position you are?  I don't understand at all how you can have the exact same reads I have and then claim that I'm not playing well for ... reasons.<br>\n<br>\nThe point I brought up to notsci is also perfectly valid one.  I would sure as hell be able to bullshit a push on someone if I was actually scum here.  But you seem to be handwave dismissing that in order to push that me not feeling strongly about any of my scum reads = me being scum.  Do you think I *couldn't* push anyone if I was scum here?<br>\n<br>\nIn short, you applying this double standard to me and only me is fucking awful and makes me want to question my town read on you here.  I would like if you could actually, you know, engage me on this because your reasoning here is *seriously* misguided at best.", "time": "Sun Aug 09, 2015 4:30 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=62686&start=1325", "forum": "53", "thread": "62686"}

I'm just going to point out a few posts, but I'll keep this pretty short and sweet:<br>\n<br>\n<fieldset style=\"border:3px outset grey;padding:5px 10px\"><blockquote><div><cite>notscience 91 wrote:</cite>RC nottown</div></blockquote><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7062375#p7062375\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7062375#p7062375\" data-post-id=\"7062375\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 118</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=22396\">pieguyn</a> wrote:</cite><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">@notsci</div>: you should wagon RC with me</div></blockquote><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7062390#p7062390\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7062390#p7062390\" data-post-id=\"7062390\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 119</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=21185\">notscience</a> wrote:</cite><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: RC</span><br>\n<br>\nI'm going to be giving [pie] sideways glances all game though.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nTwo things to point out here.

Immediately after pie tells him to vote me (and she votes me), only then is he comfortable doing the same. Make a note of this because there's a pattern forming here. The second thing I want to point out is that vote in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7062390#p7062390\">119</a> has a noteworthy qualifier in it, \"Oh, I guess I'll vote with you... but IGMEOU!\"<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7103481#p7103481\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7103481#p7103481\" data-post-id=\"7103481\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 774</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=21185\">notscience</a> wrote:</cite>Why are people townreading RC again?</div></blockquote><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7126293#p7126293\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7126293#p7126293\" data-post-id=\"7126293\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 1121</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=21185\">notscience</a> wrote:</cite>Can we wagon Nacho or RC or something</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nOkay, keeping with the pattern, here are two more instances of notscience slimming me from afar. He wants other people to do the voting so that he can join in. Neither of these times did anyone show resolve to do this on behalf of notscience (Wicked briefly voted me at the start of D2, but he removed it shortly thereafter and I think even he would say it was a rather weak vote).<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7134320#p7134320\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7134320#p7134320\" data-post-id=\"7134320\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 1442</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=21185\">notscience</a> wrote:</cite>They don't want to lynch RC so ...</div></blockquote><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7137110#p7137110\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7137110#p7137110\" data-post-id=\"7137110\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 1536</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=11658\">Nachomamma8</a> wrote:</cite><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: RedCoyote</div><br>\n<br>\nThis is where I'd rather go.</div></blockquote><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7137287#p7137287\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7137287#p7137287\" data-post-id=\"7137287\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 1545</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=21185\">notscience</a> wrote:</cite><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: RC</span><br>\n<br>\nits about damn time</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nAnd the pattern continues once again. notscience has yet to vote me on his own merits... he waits for others (in this case Nacho) to start the show, then jumps on acting like this is what he's been working towards forever. Well, yeah, he has been working towards it, in a manner of speaking. He's been working towards it by trying to get others to take the ownership of the actual wagon while he sneaks on behind them. First with pie, then he swung a couple of times and missed, and now with Nacho.</fieldset><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: Boonskiies</span>; <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: notscience</span><br>\n<br>\nIn a way, I think the Boonskiies lynch was probably too sensible anyway, so I'm sort of glad Nacho voted me if only to shake me out of indifference to another day here. Whether I'm lynched, or notscience or Boon, we'll get more out of people than we otherwise would had. But, and I've said this before and I'll say it again, it's scary how accurate pie/ffrey were talking amongst themselves earlier about how to read me. They've got a real knack for it. I wonder if they're just as good with other people. And they're right on the money this game. And Nacho has that same knack, though he's misguided here. <br>\n<br>\nLet me say one other thing, and this is kind of important: <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">I'm not a VT</div>. You can take that how you will. This may have led me to playing too conservatively. I don't know if I'll fully claim or not, but I do want that out there, I think, to influence y'alls decision on voting me or not.", "time": "Wed Aug 12, 2015 5:45 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=62686&start=1550", "forum": "53", "thread": "62686"}

Maybe it's a little nitpicky, but when Vinkah says, \"the longer this day is proceeding the less my townreads are staying firm. and its nothing more than paranoia\", I don't understand that mentality. I understand being frustrated that you are losing townreads, but there are multiple scum in this game... so that's a good thing. Why would you shy away from this? You don't embrace paranoia, but you should embrace the chance to uncover something scummy about a player you may not have suspected before. <br>\n5) This certainly has some bias in it, but I don't like his turnaround on me. A couple of points on this. One, in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7137482#p7137482\">1556</a>, Vinkah claims, essentially, that I would only vote him as scum. For one thing, Vinkah never engaged me at all about voting him. For another, Vinkah has never asked me anything in this game other than about my early Layla suspicions (hint hint, Layla's roleslot just flipped town... nice coincidence). Another point, we get this possibly misdirection play in his \"I'm not reading notsci... but vote: RC\" move. Vinkah even has the wherewithal to mention this when voting me (see: <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7136942#p7136942\">1526</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7137467#p7137467\">1553</a> then <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7137481#p7137481\">1555</a>) In short, the turnaround on me doesn't feel natural.

{"number": 1867, "id": "7148846", "user": "Tammy", "user_id": "18197", "content": "First things first.  I'm very sorry for claiming at the end of day yesterday.  I've been having a very bad week - I'm much better now - and while it may not have been on the table to lynch me for most, many?, of you, that's not how it felt to me.  How it felt to me was that there was a lot of free-floating paranoia about me and a couple scum reads and no actual town reads that when there was the suggestion to flashlynch me at deadline it felt like a real possibility and I freaked out.  I've been trying to keep a rational head about mafia lately, but I fail at it sometimes especially when I'm just feeling overwhelmed.<br>\n<br>\nThough Red - I don't feel like I've been robotic.  I have been trying to take some suspicion on me a bit more rationally or lightly, especially if it's something I might understand, in an attempt to keep the drama from getting very toxic though I don't exactly think it's my fault if noone creates drama with me and I don't know why it's a problem if I don't create drama with someone, especially since I'm very good at creating drama as scum anyway.  I also didn't feel like I was whining or crying about my meta or being busy.  It's not just this game; it's a shift that's been happening this year, and I have been explaining it as I've been getting concerns - one of which I did in a recent game with notscience in which I explicitly said it was an explanation for that game and any future games - so it did concern me that he wasn't taking that game into account.  The fact of the matter is that I think a lot of the reason I got so easily town read is because I had a lot of time at one point to be extremely active and because I was and very engaged, I got town read very easily.  Changes in my life over the course of the year means I don't have the time for that anymore.  It's a good thing!  But it has meant that I've had to shift my approach for games.  So, when I've explained it in one game, I flip town, I expect that that would be some type of consideration for how to read me, not just expect that I'm going to suddenly act just like I used to a year ago.  I don't know if that makes sense.<br>\n<br>\nAnyway, I investigated Implosion last night and got no result.  I can't understand why SS would jail keep me as that just seems silly.  I'm surprised with Implosion saying the thing about him dying being surprising considering two prs.  That death doesn't really surprise me at all if you think about it.  Nobody would kill Implosion.  Let's say he's not mafia and is in fact a 2-shot vig, why kill him?  If he takes his shot, he's essentially a VT from there on out, and leaving him alive helps with the concern that he's an SK, and if there's just one kill that he's a member of the mafia.  They wouldn't kill me for a couple reasons.  If the jailkeepre was a doc, I was the obvious protection last night, and if Implosion or Red Coyote were town, then it wouldn't matter really just to confirm them and give an obvious night kill.  And if my setup spec, hold on a minute for that, is close and if one of them is scum, mafia probably has a role blocker so it wouldn't matter.  By process of elimination they were probably able to determine who blocked the night kill (if Implosion is not mafia), so that one was a no brainer.<br>\n<br>\nAnyway, for anyone interested on whether or not I may or may not actually be a town role cop, and yes I agree with a mass claim right now because I don't expect any more power but it would be interesting if someone did claim something, here's a few things to look at:<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7067608#p7067608\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7067608#p7067608\" data-post-id=\"7067608\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 280</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=18197\">Tammy</a> wrote:</cite><br>\nI've also kinda been thinking about possible setups here as I think empire likes to experiment with stuff.

When I got my role, after complaining about getting a scummy investigative role, I got to thinking, why did I get a role cop?  So I looked at the wiki and they were talking about how the role cop is kinda a weak investigative role on a similar line as a tracker.  And that a role cop could get a result on a serial killer in a way a cop necessarily might not be able to.  Also, a role cop gets back vanilla results on goons and vts, so it's not a role that can really out a whole lot of people but it potentially good come mass claim time, so I thought that I could be really open about how I thought of the game but try to not make myself as much of a tempting night kill, which wasn't hard because I ended up not having any scum reads, while also trying to figure out how to make sure my results were out there in the case of mass claim.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7100453#p7100453\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7100453#p7100453\" data-post-id=\"7100453\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 742</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=18197\">Tammy</a> wrote:</cite>You have got to be kidding me.<br>\n<br>\nAlso, I'm not sure what that I'll does to the great reads I didn't have.

The bus driver in my mind would have had to have been town.  The * is me crumbing my result.

The end of the day is the first time I've really been *into* the game. I can understand her misreading me throughout the rest of the game. Not then. That's bullshit.

Maybe all vanilla, maybe an encryptor, like one role that can *actually* be caught by a rolecop and some roles that are completely innocuous. <br>\n<br>\n4) I didn't like RC's wall regarding vinkah. We were laying a lot of the groundwork for a vinkah push today, but he feels the need to present a case for something we had all been heavily considering. If implo is telling the truth, he's who I'd look to next. Tammy's felt legitimate in the way she claimed, obviously S-S was the jk so there's no denying. I'm just not sure I like him waiting to claim rather than the obvious come out with it at the start, but this is a playstyle difference that doesn't really mean anything.<br>\n<br>\n5) Today's lynch should be Vinkah.

It's not just this game; it's a shift that's been happening this year, and I have been explaining it as I've been getting concerns - one of which I did in a recent game with notscience in which I explicitly said it was an explanation for that game and any future games - so it did concern me that he wasn't taking that game into account. The fact of the matter is that I think a lot of the reason I got so easily town read is because I had a lot of time at one point to be extremely active and because I was and very engaged, I got town read very easily. Changes in my life over the course of the year means I don't have the time for that anymore. It's a good thing! But it has meant that I've had to shift my approach for games. So, when I've explained it in one game, I flip town, I expect that that would be some type of consideration for how to read me, not just expect that I'm going to suddenly act just like I used to a year ago.

So you trying to push that oh my god you're town and people should be able to see it after it is disingenuous as fuck.<br>\n<br>\nSecond, no, Tammy did not \"blow what you say way out of proportion\", and you pushing that she did reads like blatant manipulation.  In the first place, you shouldn't have thought her being a non-factor in this game was a reason to be concerned about her here.  And then when she asked you about it, you didn't answer it.  But, regardless, her being concerned about you claiming she doesn't setup spec did not, in fact, have to do with how she plays on a general level.  I think she was pretty obviously concerned because you had missed her setup spec'ing in this game, multiple times, since practically the very start of the game.  The logic there is consistent; and even if you just happened to miss it, it is perfectly reasonable that someone would find that hard to believe.<br>\n<br>\nI also refuse to believe you make <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7140868#p7140868\">1839</a> after the whole claimgate after she got paranoid she'd get lynched.  At that point, she was really fucking obviously town and I am 100% sure you should have been able to recognize it by then.  You acting unsure about her, or like she could potentially be \"scum manipulating her meta\" entirely ignores everything about how it actually played out and it reads like you're blatantly acting here.  The only reason she even brought it up was because YOU hadn't noticed where she had setup spec'd before; so claiming it could be her manipulating her meta after the fact is fucking awful.  And if you *were* concerned that that was she was doing, why didn't you just ... ask her about it?  I don't see you actually asking her anything to work out what your read on her actually is, and when she tried to ask you to elaborate on what was giving you reservations about her here, you kept ignoring it and saying stuff like \"I'm not sure so I don't see why it's a big deal\".  And when she asked you why you thought she'd specifically go out of her way to tailor her meta to you as opposed to other people in the game, we got ... nothing.  So how the hell were you trying to \"work with her\" here?<br>\n<br>\nThis is why I don't see a town approach in the way you played this.  In fact, it read like you were specifically trying to find something to comment on in order to look like you had a point here.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7150819#p7150819\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7150819#p7150819\" data-post-id=\"7150819\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 1890</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=20541\">fferyllt</a> wrote:</cite>What posts of notsci's are you talking about here?</div></blockquote><br>\nI hated <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7140816#p7140816\">1825</a>/<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7140879#p7140879\">1842</a>.

The inactivity is true but etc. As for the rest of it, the change in playstyle COULD be something to do with scum discussion n1 but there are plenty of people whose playstyles will change as the nature of a game/rl changes. I still don't think that I see what RC does in 683 except that it looks a bit overdramatic. Eh, maybe I do see it a bit actually. That post does have less of a sense of echoing my own sentiments than a lot of his other things that did, especially since I was looking for people to scumread for a while.

Would they be inclined to bus heavily? Would they be inclined to buddy each other? <br>\n<br>\nMy answer:<br>\n<br>\nI think the latter. The overall feeling of apathy in the town would have given scum a more-than-average amount of sway over how the town was voting, since people were looking for guidance but scum already know where they want to go. It was really hard to make a wagon stick for pretty much this entire game, IMO. Scum would, I think, take advantage of that and make it impossible for town to make a wagon on scum that sticks around.<br>\n<br>\nThe three people that I said I'd be willing to vote are never voting each other in any vote counts prior to d3. At all. And nacho/ns at least have gotten a fair amount of flak over the course of this game. Furthermore almost every single wagon with at least 3 people on it that was on someone other than nacho/ns/vinkah had at least one of nacho/ns/vinkah on it, with the exception of if there were multiple wagons not on them with at least 3 people each. I just feel like this is the kind of game where scum could get away with not having to bus at all. Again, PLEASE stop me if this is super confirmation bias-y. I want second/third/nth opinions on this.<br>\n<br>\nI also want to look a bit more at the scramble near the end of d1. The ns wagon was static at {boon, imp, rc, pie} for at least 100 posts while other things happened. I think that's interesting.

I only ask this because Ether is a reviewer and recently made a big stink about Vanilla Cop and stuff. Anyway...<br>\n<br>\nSo, at the very beginning of replacing in I was like \"hmm weird af that the little cluster of Fferyllt, Nacho, and Tammy is still alive\". That is why I initially said that group has at least 1 scum. I still stand behind that comment. <br>\n<br>\nReading through the thread, I think fferyllt is solidly town. I don't remember playing a game with fferyllt as a solo slot, but I think her play is town regardless. Fferyllt if you're scum at the end of this, I am going to be sadface.<br>\n<br>\nI think Tammy is probably? town. I am little upset that I do not think she is more town in my mind. I think her play around the proposed flashwagon and notscience stuff means she is town. <br>\nI think Pie and Notsci coming into this day wanting to 1v1 is indicative that one of them is scum. <br>\n<br>\nOk. Anyway...<br>\n<br>\nYeah, when people were claiming. Hold on horrible music is playing right now. Ok. Yeah, when people were claiming VT I was super confused why this was happening so early but it makes sense seeing as everyone important claimed yesterday. When I saw talk that implosion claimed vig I had already read like 10 pages of the game and up to that point Implosion was my strongest scum read. Like super rage boner <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">hard</div>. Hm. wrong game. But yeah, implosion's opening posts I absolutely HATED. I thought to myself, unless he has a BALLER claim/crumb he is 100% going to be my lynch today. He was the controversial opinion that I eluded too earlier. When I got to his claim, his VIG claim, it was pretty baller. Reminds me of my own types of claims. Placed at the tail end of the day, when putting Anen at L-1 at a time he thought Anen could be lynched. That all seems town motivated. However, holy fuck the coincidences of EVERYONE targetting Gnomeo night 1 is really, really, really <div style=\"display: inline; color:#000000 !important; background:#000000 !important; padding:0px 3px;\" title=\"This text is hidden to prevent spoilers; to reveal, highlight it with your cursor.\">not likely</div>. <br>\n<br>\nHis choice of shot on Gnomeo is super sketch. Like Pie pointed out, Gnomeo was not in a \"viggable\" spot on his reads list and the reasoning that he \"went\" with town's opinion is utter shit. SCUM ARE APART OF THE PEOPLE IN THE TOWN. HELLOOOOOO. The only reason you ever do that is if there are two wagons that have been competing all day and you need both flips to progress through the game. Gnomeo was not that type of kill. So yeah, the claim itself looks legit but the play surrounding the claim looks so unlegit. Like god. I wish I was the vig. So sad.  Anyway, implosion AGAIN choosing not to shoot is sketch as fuck. And if he *doesn't* shoot tonight he is 100% the lynch tomorrow. Even if scum have an RB, and it SURE as hell better not be a more than 2 shot RB or the reviewers sux, implosion should be confirmed tomorrow. Tammy should take a 50% on choosing one of RC/Implosion I think. HOWEVER, I think implosion should choose to shoot RC. BUT fuck. One of the main reasons I want to shoot RC is because of his claim.<br>\n<br>\nWhen I saw RC's claim that was like when my mind started to implode and leak out my nostrils and ears and tear ducts. It was bad. Oh my god bad. Miller is a claim that scum can preemptively play like... And RC in my mind is like the complete opposite of Implosion. Whereas with Implosion I HATED his play throughout the day, I thought RC's play was not that bad during the day. Whereas with Implosion I loved the claim, I hated RC's claim. I think both of those dropped the ball somewhat with how to play the role effectively. RC playing dumb about a death miller is also sketch too. <br>\n<br>\nANYWAY Ya. THEN TAMMY CLAIMS ROLECOP AND I'M LIKE WTF WHY WOULD SHE DO THAT AT THAT MOMENT. And that was when I was like wtf spamming the thread.<br>\nBut she had a town explosion of emotion so I think she is probably town. I hope she is town. I've never actually played AGAINST Tammy scum that I can remember? Maybe one of those Stack the Deck games on an alt of mine? I can't remember. Can't be asked to find it. <br>\n<br>\nBut yeah... <br>\n<br>\nPrior to getting mind fucked I was like \"lol this game is so easy, scum team is Nacho, Implosion 1 of {RC, Notsci, Pieguyn}. Before I got mindfucked I was heavily leaning on Pie scum. DOn't know how she plays but I thought Notsci was being pretty town during the early days. But yeah. Nacho has been a scum read of mine since around the time of growing lynch boner for implosion. He was a pretty early scum read of mine. I think Nacho also makes sense with Notsci scum. Nacho should have caught notsci scum by now like he did in that other game we just had. Forgetting the name, Nightingale. Yes. I expected BoP on Nacho to give us a determinant read on Notsci. <br>\n<br>\nWICKED<br>\nMan I thought he was town throughout the entire day but since Claimgate 2k15 I honestly have no idea. I could talk myself to seeing him as scum. He doesn't seem to have as much of presence today as he did earlier which is indicative of his place in the game. But damn. My gut says he is town.<br>\n<br>\nSo yeah.

So, less sure about him.<br>\n<br>\nNacho is the one I'm really worried about.  he talked about our usual town mind meld, but I've only had flickers of that.  the strongest flicker was on day 1 when he was rethinking Anen.

It's sitting out there in the thread in a strange place with no obvious antecedent because the drivers were all internal.  Anyway, he's been going back and forth with you over one vote most of the game day while all this crap is happening between notsci vs pie.

If oversoul is scum and he makes a big post everyone but me and RC likes, then that is the absolute perfect time for her to spend some town cred pushing me. Bonus is she knows that she's justified in feeling paranoia based on some of the recent games together and she knows that I probably won't push her back in response to paranoia since I normally don't, so even if she doesn't get me lynched, she knows she's probably safe and she knows taking a position like that in response to my oversoul read is immediately going to make me doubt my oversoul read. If we were to get really, really crazy then it might even be possible that Layla jailed me N1, Ffery shot me, and that explains why S-S treated his scum read on me the way he did (kept it in the back of his mind, didn't really pursue it) and it would most definitely explain why S-S died in the night almost immediately because no one else had a weird interaction with me and the only person who would probably protect me N1 would be Tammy who claimed rolecop at that point :/<br>\n<br>\nThe reasons I thought Ffery was town dealt a lot with how she opened the game; normally her first few posts as scum are the weakest until she gets in a good groove. I liked her interactions with S-S a lot; her townread on that slot seemed like she was refreshed and relieved and I don't think that tone really comes across in her posting that clearly as scum.

I only had like an hour-hour and a half to post/read this game before I left and this isn't the only game I need to give attention (there's a few other games on this site/offsite that I need to remain caught up in), and even that was on/off because we're in the middle of moving a house and there's a lot of random shit my parents call me for.  So, given the time I had, I hardly had any time to actually sit down, read the game in-depth, and do stuff.  Most of when I actually have a hard block of time to read/make actual cases in games comes really really late at night.  The majority of what I read, not counting Nacho's posts, was RC and implo posting what looked like ridiculous reasons for Oversoul being scum here.  Based on the fact I had other shit I needed to do, the only thing I could really say was that the Oversoul wagon was awful; I didn't really have a chance to sit down and make an actual case on why the way Oversoul played this wasn't coming from scum or why, specifically, I think Nacho is trying to push a counterwagon here.  So yeah, it is an activity-related reason.<br>\n<br>\nI was already really on edge because notsci's approach this game day has essentially amounted to repeating that I'm scum over and over without any logical reason for it.  Which, in addition to being the exact same fucking shit Nacho pulled in the last game where he was scum against me and got me mislynched (and he's doing the same fucking thing again here, he's just being a lot more low-key about it and doesn't have me as his primary read), is just a really stupid scum strategy (and is something I've seen a lot of recently from people like MS and Titus) and something I wish people would stop doing entirely because it takes all the enjoyment out of the game for me.  It essentially reduces the game to whoever is more active and is best able to outyell everyone else; which, in the first place, is not something I'm capable of doing in my current position RL-wise (the fact that Nacho was able to walk in here and flood the thread with posts to push the Oversoul wagon is testimony to this), but it's not fun at all.<br>\n<br>\nI also saw more similar posts coming from him - as one example, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7159849#p7159849\">2355</a>.  I have no idea how people *ever* read posts like this and think it's coming from anything *but* an overdefensive-scum mindset.  This is the kind of shit people like BRO always pull as scum (which he did in the last game I had with him and I correctly called him out on it) and I have no idea how it apparently continues to work every game despite it being transparent as fuck.<br>\n<br>\nThe other thing that has me really on edge here is that I think it's really fairly fucking obvious I'm town here if you read the end of D2; there is literally no reason I would have played it the way I did as scum unless I'm scum with RC.  And, SURPRISE, both notsci and Nacho are trying to act entirely like that point doesn't exist.  They don't have any counterargument for it, so they just attempt to mist over it and justify it with \"lol, ur better at logic than me\", never mind the fact it's entirely objective and it should really be fucking straightforward to explain any sort of reason I would have done it as scum.<br>\n<br>\nI am sorry if my reaction was overblown.  At that point, I had been watching the thread for  about half an hour, but hadn't been able to post because I was playing a game with some of my other friends and so I couldn't actually type a response to anything - and then I kept seeing him trying to push more and more blatantly false reasons for me being scum here.  Then he tried to claim that it was scummy that I wasn't \"derailing the Oversoul wagon\" (when I had done basically all I could given the time I had for the game) and I lost all interest in being civil here.  It didn't remotely help that in another recent game I played I was in a similar position RL-wise and had people pushing that I was scum for \"avoiding the thread\", and felt for a majority of the game until I *actually* had more time to do anything to begin with and was able to post a bunch of analysis that no one would town read me or be willing to pay attention to anything I was writing that game.<br>\n<br>\nLastly, I am taking Nacho seeing this and still scum reading me as a hard scum claim (if his push on ffery wasn't enough of one already).  And notsci attempting to double down after seeing this is entirely bullshit.  I'm nowhere near an emotionally manipulative player as scum, and he knows this about me (Nacho correctly pointed this out in the last game we played).<br>\n<br>\nIf anyone has any questions, don't hesitate to ask.

You're welcome to share what's false about what i said- Are you not defending Tammy? Did you not do that thing Mala always does to me? Are you not scumreading me when I'm town? <br>\n<br>\nYou had time to mention the wagon and didn't do anything more than mention it. That is my issue. Your time is irrelevant. I understand you had issues, but if you have time to bring it up every fucking time I get suspicious of you and then yell at me for scumreading you for ACTIVITY ISSUES when I had made a point to try and be transparent about reasons, even using some that YOU were the one who brought them to light to me. Why? So you can create a damn dialogue with me because you're so hard set I'm scum for bullshit reasons and hell, even knowing I'm fucking me would tell you I want to work with you. <br>\n<br>\nIt's like you're so far stuck down that rabbithole you can't even fucking see it anymore which is what I have been saying repeatedly and I have issue thinknig town you would get so far down it regarding me. Like its like you arent even considering the option you'rewrong and I don't know why town you wouldn't because im here waffling like holy fuck regarding you and you just are so fuckig adamant im scum and youre wrong and it just sucks.", "time": "Thu Aug 20, 2015 7:14 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=62686&start=2425", "forum": "53", "thread": "62686"}

I think if he was scum here, he'd either go balls-deep and continue with the PR claim or retract it immediately, not fucking both.  in fact, I think continuing with the PR claim would have been a *lot* more convenient for scum-him here; it'd at the very least give him a greater chance at getting out of the lynch (and, if uncontested, could potentially allow him to survive to endgame).<br>\n<br>\nretracting it, on the other hand, essentially doesn't do anything besides make him look bad.  seriously.  what the fuck does scum-Oversoul have to gain by retracting it in the way he did?  somebody (I'M LOOKING AT YOU, RC) please tell me because it doesn't make any sense and I still haven't seen a compelling reason for it anywhere.<br>\n<br>\nI also don't make anything of him asking Tammy to rolecop him when he was in reality just a VT, for the obvious reason that he should theoretically just be able to kill Tammy anyway if he is scum here.  I also think that due to him/Tammy apparently having a lot of experience with each other, he thought Tammy would see a potential VT result on him and pick up on what he was trying to do (that is, she would see him as clearly town for it as opposed to questioning why he lied).  so the fact that he did that doesn't bug me.  I also don't really agree that it was as misleading as a lot of people in this game seem to think it is - I had thought of the possibility that he was just VT fake claiming when it first came up (see: the first line of my setup spec post), and it appears some others had done the same.<br>\n<br>\noutside of the claim, I thought the sheer level of conviction he had in response to his wagon read town.  <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7158260#p7158260\">2288</a> is one post in particular that makes me think this; I have no idea how people can read posts like this and think it comes from a scum player.<br>\n<br>\nI think that the Oversoul wagon is in large part a scum power play - in no small part due to certain people's changes in reads from D2/D3.

How unsure of yourself you must be to even think I'd accept any conditional addendum. I'm exceedingly confident Oversoul will flip scum. So much so that I'd even allow Nacho to go first, potentially making us look like fools in the process, in order to secure his lynch. Unlike Oversoul, I have zero confidence Nacho will flip scum. I don't know what he'll flip. The only thing that bodes well for him is that he sees Oversoul as scummy as I do. <br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>ffrey 2556 wrote:</cite>Why did you leave your role out? because it's passive?</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_question.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":?:\" title=\"Question\"><br>\n<br>\nI should question the presence of my own role...?

No. That's the hardest aspect of this for me to believe is that Oversoul, as town, could actually think to himself \"hmm I need to protect other power roles, this is the job for me, this could actually work\". It's an awful gambit if he's town. I think he's scum trying to do something that there's \"no way that scum would do\" (absolutely no wifom there) in an effort to get rid of the wagon'd slot he replaced into.

I also think that due to him/Tammy apparently having a lot of experience with each other, he thought Tammy would see a potential VT result on him and pick up on what he was trying to do (that is, she would see him as clearly town for it as opposed to questioning why he lied).  so the fact that he did that doesn't bug me.  I also don't really agree that it was as misleading as a lot of people in this game seem to think it is - I had thought of the possibility that he was just VT fake claiming when it first came up (see: the first line of my setup spec post), and it appears some others had done the same.</div></blockquote><br>\nBy that same logic, he should realize, if he's town, that Tammy has a high chance of dying tonight.

I'm looking for any damn reason that someone could be scum because if I just go by process of elimination alone then I'd have eliminated everyone a long time ago, so I can only rely on the more confident of those eliminations right now.

It felt like he went through multiple instances of being dead-certain that pie was scum and then retracting that certainty, like a real paranoid townie. Like someone who felt that their view of the game was starting to collapse and that they had to change something. pie's was very sudden and felt reactive to notscience. <br>\n<br>\nIt comes down to this: pie's suspicion of notscience was extremely consistently unwavering. Iirc, she was constantly tunneling notscience even through the early stages of notscience trying to work with pie/showing paranoia over the pie scumread (point out if I missed pie stating some uncertainty over her notscience read because if I did miss something like this then this argument has a lot less merit). That level of dedication to the scumread doesn't feel like something that pie could just sleep on and suddenly be over. Conversely switching to a townread on notscience there is *extremely* convenient for pie-scum: notscience was becoming a less in-vogue scumread, and it gives pie the opportunity to start pushing nacho (this makes more sense if nacho is town, which i think in turn makes sense if oversoul is scum). I guess I am somewhat pushing an oversoul-pie team here. I guess nacho town doesn't technically strictly imply oversoul scum assuming my strong townreads but i think it does by poe unless it's something like pie-ffery-wicked which would be silly. <br>\n<br>\nIdk.

From my impression of their dynamic scum-notscience would know that trying to elicit a townread from pie would be futile and so would just try to appeal to those already townreading him and go after pie that way.

What bugs me is 2445/2446. When you made those posts were the cogs already turning in your head as to notscience being possibly town, and you were just suppressing those thoughts and not posting them? Or did you literally flip entirely in one night? <br>\n<br>\nAnother thing that bugs me at a really basic level is just how you both were convinced to an absolute degree that each other were scum and then it disappeared.

For some reason the you -&gt; notscience direction of that bugs me more. It might be because of ns saying that you tend to be more logical than he does.<br>\n<br>\nThere was a part of me 2 hours ago that was convinced that if we lynched os and he flipped scum that I was going to shoot you and you'd flip scum.

I actually have no memory of why I was calling Nacho's posturing town. <br>\n<br>\nTo further elaborate on why I'm inclined to say that Nacho's claim is town after further thought: what scum thought-process would have led to scum-nacho claiming backup rolecop? I definitely don't think it would be him actually being a mafia backup rolecop, I think he'd realize that we'd say it could be a scum role and be disincentivized from it because of that. So he's doing it for towncred, right? He's switching from a vt claim to a backup rolecop claim for towncred. In what world is that actually going to work? I know that me typing this IS that world in one sense, because the claim has made me think that he's town. But more generally backup rolecop is not an extremely believable claim. I guess thinking about it on another level the only way it reasonably makes sense is if he wanted to claim backup rolecop as a springboard to getting me mislynched, since he figured that we'd just auto-lynch from VT claims+RC with the three claimed power roles seeming like a very reasonable setup. I guess I could actually see that making sense.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Nacho</div>: since you didn't claim your role during the massclaim, did it ever cross your mind that you'd be scrutinized for that? Did you think to drop some kind of crumb so that we would know that you aren't just making up the claim post-massclaim because it's scumvenient? Did you think that we would just believe you when you claimed, and so didn't feel the need? Or did you just not even consider it?<br>\n<br>\nWRT the stuff you said about you pie, yeah, I guess it makes sense but I still have some waffles. Idk.

But I will say this since it was the last thing I thought about when I had time to think about this game:<br>\n<br>\nI think implosion is town. Unless he is some Fate, Katsuki, Kuribo, DGB hybrid level of cheekiness, a vig claim as scum is suicidal. I *can* see a few options for a scum member to claim vig, but I do not think implosion would do it on Day 2, especially with how shittily he did. His claim was rubbish. I think implosion would have more tact as scum to put something decent together. A Bookie is the only way implosion-scum can reliably claim vig or else he has to explain every night why a kill is missing.

Unless the town can guarantee that the 1v1 takes out the BEST scum player on the scumteam or the MOST powerful role, it is always going to be inherently scumsided. Why? Because in most cases, the town will be lynched first since there are 3 (at least in this case) votes that are most likely going to go against the townsperson in that I case. Additionally, Notscience was okay with dying if we lynched Pie the next day, yet that is one of the most detrimental things to do for the game if Notscience is town. For 2 night kills and 1 town lynch (from Notscience's point of view), we get 1 scum and put ourselves right back into LyLo.

Both Tammy and I could pick up on the SK whether he had investigative immunity or not (since this is a normal game), and putting two people who can investigate and find solo scum is absolutely brutal and cruel and unusual, even for Empire. This isn't even getting into interactions with Jailkeeper (and I don't know if SKs are even allowed to have strongmans or not), so, if implosion gets a shot off, he is 100% confirmed town of the no asking questions and no going back variety. <br>\n<br>\n2) Five power roles in the game seems excessive. I'm reading Tammy/RC town to a level on individual play to the point where I'm happy saying that neither of those two are scum, which means that implosion is almost certainly scum. It would be hard for an all-town PR combination to actually work thanks to the dynamic multiple rolecops actually have with a scumteam (the more powerful a scumteam, the more powerful town rolecops become); the only only way that I can even sort of see something like that actually working is a roleblocker/ascetic scumteam, which I'm not even sure is normal, but even in that worst case scenario, we should still be able to recover with a scum lynch today.<br>\n<br>\nI think the idea of lynching in the claimed PRs is stupid when the only valid suspicions within them are me/implosion and we have a very magical ability to definitively sort ourselves out during the night; the only way that it actually makes sense is if you think we are scum together, which is not something I've seen peddled around a whole bunch but feel free to correct me if I just haven't been paying attention.", "time": "Tue Aug 25, 2015 3:05 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=62686&start=2750", "forum": "53", "thread": "62686"}

I also don't really agree that it was as misleading as a lot of people in this game seem to think it is - I had thought of the possibility that he was just VT fake claiming when it first came up (see: the first line of my setup spec post), and it appears some others had done the same.</div></blockquote><br>\nI can't think of anyone in this world who I have that kind of relationship with where I would be able to go \"here, let me fakeclaim a power role and have this person investigate me but they won't really investigate me because they know I'm town and fakeclaiming!\", and I think anyone making that assumption of anyone else is unreasonable as hell except in extraordinary circumstances. My current working theory is that Oversoul's initial intention was to have Tammy investigate him overnight so that she wouldn't worry about his alignment during the day and then kill her overnight, but the real reason why this particular exchange is a concern instead of an \"oh oversoul!\" moment is that it seems like he's overcompensating with his interactions with Tammy. When someone reads you well through interacting with them, the next response after lurking and avoiding is overcompensating; it happens when I'm scum and overcompensating for tone with flowery language, and it used to be really prevalent in games with people I was afraid of where I would interact with them just a little *too* much and in places where it didn't make sense.

Both Tammy and I could pick up on the SK whether he had investigative immunity or not (since this is a normal game), and putting two people who can investigate and find solo scum is absolutely brutal and cruel and unusual, even for Empire. This isn't even getting into interactions with Jailkeeper (and I don't know if SKs are even allowed to have strongmans or not), so, if implosion gets a shot off, he is 100% confirmed town of the no asking questions and no going back variety. <br>\n<br>\n2) Five power roles in the game seems excessive. I'm reading Tammy/RC town to a level on individual play to the point where I'm happy saying that neither of those two are scum, which means that implosion is almost certainly scum. It would be hard for an all-town PR combination to actually work thanks to the dynamic multiple rolecops actually have with a scumteam (the more powerful a scumteam, the more powerful town rolecops become); the only only way that I can even sort of see something like that actually working is a roleblocker/ascetic scumteam, which I'm not even sure is normal, but even in that worst case scenario, we should still be able to recover with a scum lynch today.<br>\n<br>\nI think the idea of lynching in the claimed PRs is stupid when the only valid suspicions within them are me/implosion and we have a very magical ability to definitively sort ourselves out during the night; the only way that it actually makes sense is if you think we are scum together, which is not something I've seen peddled around a whole bunch but feel free to correct me if I just haven't been paying attention.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nGreat points, both of these. Maybe this is what ffrey was trying to say except she looked all scummy and unsure of herself when she said it (and maybe because she's not voting Oversoul, lol). I've never really worried about implosion post-mid-D2. For the life of me, I can't understand why he keeps getting brought back up into the equation. Anyway, yes, Nacho is right. implosion makes a lot of sense as plain jane scum on the back of point 2 (but he's easily able to prove this completely wrong tonight of course).", "time": "Tue Aug 25, 2015 3:49 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=62686&start=2750", "forum": "53", "thread": "62686"}

I remember back in the epicmafia days when people always thought self-description was pointless but I'd always disagreed with that. So let's see...<br>\n<br>\n1) The vig softclaim &amp; claim. If I were scum, from an outside point of view, I would have had to be planning a vig claim from day one since I breadcrumbed it. I would have had to have the creativity to crumb it when something relevant to me faking vig had been said. I don't think I would have been able to come up with that as scum. There's exactly one game that I can think of as scum where I made a really ballsy fakeclaim, and I did it basically because I was entirely on my own (it was a 9p game and I was replacing into a slot whose scumbuddy was pretty much going to be the d1 lynch, and wound up being the d1 lynch) and it was the only way I could imagine winning. I'd have no reason to set up a vig claim of all things as scum who doesn't know the setup on day one. I'd be setting myself up for certain death if there was actually a vig. I'd be setting myself up for certain death if vig doesn't fit the setup (which it does, because we already have claimed/dead investigative and protective roles to go with it). I constantly *CONSTANTLY* told the town throughout the entirety of day two that they could direct my shot if they were mistrustful of me. That would be absolutely suicidal as scum. <br>\n<br>\nMost of the rest of what I can say is meta-specific, i.e. it's just a description of my town and scum playstyles and how this does not fit my scum playstyle. And this is somewhat difficult to do since, again, I can't remember the most recent scumgames I've played well since they were a long time ago. I certainly would not be switching to townreading you for the sake of getting you to townread me back; that doesn't work in practice and like I've said, my style as scum is to mostly go with genuine reads as much as I can. Why would I as scum give that much of a shit whether or not you in particular townread me? You're one of the most widely scumread slots in the game; if I were scum I would not need to devote particular attention to your slot. <br>\n<br>\nIf you were asking me this question and were actually interested in the answer I could ISO myself and give more. But that isn't really worth it.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>What was the game?</div></blockquote><br>\n<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=62685\" class=\"postlink\">http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=62685</a><br>\nTown: 2-shot vig + rolecop + gunsmith<br>\nScum: goon + doctor + watcher variant (automatically watched the scumkill if they made it)", "time": "Tue Aug 25, 2015 7:17 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=62686&start=2775", "forum": "53", "thread": "62686"}

Um no that's not true, try again. You're being ridiculous. Did I \"maintain them as my top two for the entire day\" or did I \"not really commit to either\" ? You can't argue both in the same sentence. <div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">That's a contradiction.</div> <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":roll:\" title=\"Rolling Eyes\">  I had been pushing Nacho and scum reading Vinkah since day 2. Day 3 was no different, they were my top two scum reads for ALL of day 3 and I almost always had my vote on one of them. I probably focused 75% of my energy on arguing why they were scum yesterday (which isn't bad considering their inactivity). I even made a big post arguing with <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">your</div> Oversoul-defense - nice of you to forget.  <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_igmeou.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":igmeou:\" title=\"IGMEOU\">  So this \"not really committing\" point is garbage.<br>\n<br>\n2. This also doesn't make sense. You think I was distancing from Nacho, but you also think I didn't want the attention if he got lynched. <div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">That's a contradiction.</div> No, if I was bussing Nacho, then I would want it to be at least somewhat noticeable. And again: I was scum reading Vinkah long before he became a wagon, so this opportunism point is also bad. <br>\n<br>\n3. You can't argue that my Nacho-push was weaker than my Oversoul and then criticize my Oversoul push in the same sentence. <div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">That's a contradiction.</div> <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">See the pattern everyone?</div> I have several other problems with this sentence from you. a.) I explained why I didn't have much reasoning for my Nacho vote, but it doesn't seem like that explanation really interests you. <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_shifty.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":shifty:\" title=\"Shifty-Eyed\">  b.) You are calling my Nacho-reasoning weak, but my vote for him was certainly not the least-justified vote. c.) There's <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">zero</div></div> motivation for me to craft a multi-point case for Nacho-scum when I was already getting lots of support AND when I genuinely didn't have any other points to give AND when I have other things that I like to do in my life. <br>\n<br>\nSeriously, give me a friggin break, this post is awful. Starting to feel like you might be the townread I was wrong about and that I'm <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">your</div> final mis-lynch target. You spent the entire game ignoring me and now that Oversoul's gone, it's my turn, huh? <br>\n<br>\nYou haven't given a single legitimate reason for disliking my Nacho push. Instead you've just attacked the push without considering my reasoning. You are dead set on scum reading me today. If I had taken any other stance with regard to Nacho (ignoring him completely or defending him against the bandwagon) then you could still easily scum read me for <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">not</div> attacking him. But the fact of the matter is that I attacked Nacho so you have to scum read me for \"bussing\". But really I could have taken any stance wrt Nacho and you'd have found a way to have issue with it I bet. Again, it seems like this is true, because your reasons are awful/forced and you've ignored my town motivation/explanations for everything I've done. <br>\n<br>\nHmm... on the topic of bad Nacho votes - what would you think if a player pushed the bandwagon and then <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7171867#p7171867\" class=\"postlink\">unvoted for weak reasoning</a> ?

Similar to this game, I see myself making one bad move (hammering town), after another (pushing Vinkah to the point where he replaces out), after another (being unable to draw a NK), after another (having to claim), after another (pursuing townOversoul), after another (effectively aiding Nacho's intent to draw a shot from implosion) after another (being unable to articulate how clear it is in my mind that Tammy's role should necessarily give you, if not total 100% comfort that my role claim is genuine, at least a strong sense of doubt in the possibility that I'm scum ... and this isn't speaking to you necessarily, ffrey, moreso to pie/ns).

Late into the day, I suggested that another wagon should also get some attention so that the town may benefit further down the line from an atmosphere where there were two competing wagons, but I phrased it poorly and was pounced on by a number of players. As I tried to clarify my comments, I seemed to be digging myself into a deeper hole which led to the quoted post. I thought the best thing I could do when I saw myself in real danger of being lynched was to try and take a step back and tell everyone that I would remove myself from the conversation.

I feel like I let this town down.\" I replaced into this game very late, but Ythill replaced in even later. From the start I never really was able to get a good feel for the game, and, not long after replacing in, two of my big scumreads flipped town. That took a blow to my self-esteem and scumhunting ability. So much so that I effectively conceded that Ythill's reads were stronger and better than anything I could come up with. I was so in the tank for Ythill that I made that second post I quoted. Again, highly emotional. The reason for these quotes were due to the fact that I was not confident in my scumhunting abilities (and, in fact, the only reason we won that game was due to heavy scum lurking) and that I basically allowed myself to take a completely passive role for the remainder of the game until lylo.</fieldset>", "time": "Tue Sep 01, 2015 8:45 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=62686&start=3025", "forum": "53", "thread": "62686"}

Similar to this game, I see myself making one bad move (hammering town), after another (pushing Vinkah to the point where he replaces out), after another (being unable to draw a NK), after another (having to claim), after another (pursuing townOversoul), after another (effectively aiding Nacho's intent to draw a shot from implosion) after another (being unable to articulate how clear it is in my mind that Tammy's role should necessarily give you, if not total 100% comfort that my role claim is genuine, at least a strong sense of doubt in the possibility that I'm scum ... and this isn't speaking to you necessarily, ffrey, moreso to pie/ns). So the culmination of all those things gives me pains in my stomach that are only being prolonged as I feel like I see the writing on the wall going into D4. <br>\n<br>\n<div align=\"center\"><hr style=\"height:14px;width:20%\"></div><a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3133014#p3133014\" class=\"postlink\">Subject: DEFCON Mafia 3.0 - Over, American Victory!</a><br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>RedCoyote wrote:</cite>I see your point, inHim.

Here is a situation where I was lynched on D1 after actually being seen as relatively townie most of the day. My top scumread at the time was the leading wagon and I was riding high. Late into the day, I suggested that another wagon should also get some attention so that the town may benefit further down the line from an atmosphere where there were two competing wagons, but I phrased it poorly and was pounced on by a number of players. As I tried to clarify my comments, I seemed to be digging myself into a deeper hole which led to the quoted post. I thought the best thing I could do when I saw myself in real danger of being lynched was to try and take a step back and tell everyone that I would remove myself from the conversation. I think it's easy to draw a line between what I am doing in the quoted post with what I am doing in this game.<br>\n<br>\n<div align=\"center\"><hr style=\"height:14px;width:20%\"></div><a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2562564#p2562564\" class=\"postlink\">Subject: Open 226: Big Love - Game over!

From the start I never really was able to get a good feel for the game, and, not long after replacing in, two of my big scumreads flipped town. That took a blow to my self-esteem and scumhunting ability. So much so that I effectively conceded that Ythill's reads were stronger and better than anything I could come up with. I was so in the tank for Ythill that I made that second post I quoted. Again, highly emotional. The reason for these quotes were due to the fact that I was not confident in my scumhunting abilities (and, in fact, the only reason we won that game was due to heavy scum lurking) and that I basically allowed myself to take a completely passive role for the remainder of the game until lylo.</fieldset></div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nI don't think Eclipse is a good comparison to this game.

If I wanted to give an actually accurate answer to this question I'd need to look at the end of day one, but I'm not entirely sure if that would even be accurate because I have no idea what my mindset would be going into a game like this as a serial killer.<br>\n<br>\nWith regards to RC. The first thing to discuss is his claim. He's been falling back a lot upon the laurel that the rolecop confirms his role, i.e. the existence of a rolecop should make his role more reasonable to exist. While this is not strictly true, it is somewhat true that a rolecop makes more sense with a miller in the game. Jailkeeper isn't a particularly useful role to find because it can easily be scum; vig is a role that confirms itself anyway. There isn't a whole lot of utility for a rolecop in this game with only vanilla townies alive other than myself, even if there's some scum who gives a positive. <br>\n<br>\nNext there's the claim itself, i.e. the whole \"i'm not a vt\" debacle. That way of claiming just adds obstacles as scum - if he gets lynched that day, he has to explain why he wasn't nightkilled or why nothing else strange happened because he's obviously going to claim that he was trying to draw a nightkill. <br>\n<br>\nHis Vinkah/OS tunnel comprises literally the entirety of his d3. It's either town who was just caught in what turned out to be a bad tunnel, or scum resting on their laurels. I guess he could have been trying to defend Nacho from being the next likely lynch target but I don't feel like defending Nacho would be super high priority for the scum at that point. I think the tunnel seems more likely from town given that he had a very detailed case at the start of the day - I can see it as very reasonable for town to have tunneled that deeply, but I think RC-scum would have given himself at least some outs. If OS is lynched and flips town of course that makes RC look bad. If Nacho were lynched and flipped scum, that would also make him look bad even though he'd been putting some suspicion on Nacho because he'd been tunneling the other wagon so hard. It just doesn't make that much sense. <br>\n<br>\nAnother thing that pinged town was the series of posts from <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7156198#p7156198\">2124</a>-2130. The emotion felt genuine to me and it did feel to me like that particular series of posts made him look like very clear town at least at face value, so 2129 in particular felt genuine to me.

So you trying to push that oh my god you're town and people should be able to see it after it is disingenuous as fuck.<br>\n<br>\nSecond, no, Tammy did not \"blow what you say way out of proportion\", and you pushing that she did reads like blatant manipulation.  In the first place, you shouldn't have thought her being a non-factor in this game was a reason to be concerned about her here.  And then when she asked you about it, you didn't answer it.  But, regardless, her being concerned about you claiming she doesn't setup spec did not, in fact, have to do with how she plays on a general level.  I think she was pretty obviously concerned because you had missed her setup spec'ing in this game, multiple times, since practically the very start of the game.  The logic there is consistent; and even if you just happened to miss it, it is perfectly reasonable that someone would find that hard to believe.<br>\n<br>\nI also refuse to believe you make <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7140868#p7140868\">1839</a> after the whole claimgate after she got paranoid she'd get lynched.  At that point, she was really fucking obviously town and I am 100% sure you should have been able to recognize it by then.  You acting unsure about her, or like she could potentially be \"scum manipulating her meta\" entirely ignores everything about how it actually played out and it reads like you're blatantly acting here.  The only reason she even brought it up was because YOU hadn't noticed where she had setup spec'd before; so claiming it could be her manipulating her meta after the fact is fucking awful.  And if you *were* concerned that that was she was doing, why didn't you just ... ask her about it?  I don't see you actually asking her anything to work out what your read on her actually is, and when she tried to ask you to elaborate on what was giving you reservations about her here, you kept ignoring it and saying stuff like \"I'm not sure so I don't see why it's a big deal\".  And when she asked you why you thought she'd specifically go out of her way to tailor her meta to you as opposed to other people in the game, we got ... nothing.  So how the hell were you trying to \"work with her\" here?<br>\n<br>\nThis is why I don't see a town approach in the way you played this.  In fact, it read like you were specifically trying to find something to comment on in order to look like you had a point here.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7150819#p7150819\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7150819#p7150819\" data-post-id=\"7150819\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 1890</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=20541\">fferyllt</a> wrote:</cite>What posts of notsci's are you talking about here?</div></blockquote><br>\nI hated <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7140816#p7140816\">1825</a>/<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7140879#p7140879\">1842</a>.

I only had like an hour-hour and a half to post/read this game before I left and this isn't the only game I need to give attention (there's a few other games on this site/offsite that I need to remain caught up in), and even that was on/off because we're in the middle of moving a house and there's a lot of random shit my parents call me for.  So, given the time I had, I hardly had any time to actually sit down, read the game in-depth, and do stuff.  Most of when I actually have a hard block of time to read/make actual cases in games comes really really late at night.  The majority of what I read, not counting Nacho's posts, was RC and implo posting what looked like ridiculous reasons for Oversoul being scum here.  Based on the fact I had other shit I needed to do, the only thing I could really say was that the Oversoul wagon was awful; I didn't really have a chance to sit down and make an actual case on why the way Oversoul played this wasn't coming from scum or why, specifically, I think Nacho is trying to push a counterwagon here.  So yeah, it is an activity-related reason.<br>\n<br>\nI was already really on edge because notsci's approach this game day has essentially amounted to repeating that I'm scum over and over without any logical reason for it.  Which, in addition to being the exact same fucking shit Nacho pulled in the last game where he was scum against me and got me mislynched (and he's doing the same fucking thing again here, he's just being a lot more low-key about it and doesn't have me as his primary read), is just a really stupid scum strategy (and is something I've seen a lot of recently from people like MS and Titus) and something I wish people would stop doing entirely because it takes all the enjoyment out of the game for me.  It essentially reduces the game to whoever is more active and is best able to outyell everyone else; which, in the first place, is not something I'm capable of doing in my current position RL-wise (the fact that Nacho was able to walk in here and flood the thread with posts to push the Oversoul wagon is testimony to this), but it's not fun at all.<br>\n<br>\nI also saw more similar posts coming from him - as one example, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7159849#p7159849\">2355</a>.  I have no idea how people *ever* read posts like this and think it's coming from anything *but* an overdefensive-scum mindset.  This is the kind of shit people like BRO always pull as scum (which he did in the last game I had with him and I correctly called him out on it) and I have no idea how it apparently continues to work every game despite it being transparent as fuck.<br>\n<br>\nThe other thing that has me really on edge here is that I think it's really fairly fucking obvious I'm town here if you read the end of D2; there is literally no reason I would have played it the way I did as scum unless I'm scum with RC.  And, SURPRISE, both notsci and Nacho are trying to act entirely like that point doesn't exist.  They don't have any counterargument for it, so they just attempt to mist over it and justify it with \"lol, ur better at logic than me\", never mind the fact it's entirely objective and it should really be fucking straightforward to explain any sort of reason I would have done it as scum.<br>\n<br>\nI am sorry if my reaction was overblown.  At that point, I had been watching the thread for  about half an hour, but hadn't been able to post because I was playing a game with some of my other friends and so I couldn't actually type a response to anything - and then I kept seeing him trying to push more and more blatantly false reasons for me being scum here.  Then he tried to claim that it was scummy that I wasn't \"derailing the Oversoul wagon\" (when I had done basically all I could given the time I had for the game) and I lost all interest in being civil here.  It didn't remotely help that in another recent game I played I was in a similar position RL-wise and had people pushing that I was scum for \"avoiding the thread\", and felt for a majority of the game until I *actually* had more time to do anything to begin with and was able to post a bunch of analysis that no one would town read me or be willing to pay attention to anything I was writing that game.<br>\n<br>\nLastly, I am taking Nacho seeing this and still scum reading me as a hard scum claim (if his push on ffery wasn't enough of one already).

The worst thing in the world is for the town players in this game to make their decisions on something as solid and objective as the setup &amp; roles, so pie absolutely would love to obfuscate that.

Empire put that specific role in this setup for a reason. He didn't put a regular cop or a tracker or a watcher or anything else. He used a role cop.

If I wanted to give an actually accurate answer to this question I'd need to look at the end of day one, but I'm not entirely sure if that would even be accurate because I have no idea what my mindset would be going into a game like this as a serial killer.<br>\n<br>\nWith regards to RC. The first thing to discuss is his claim. He's been falling back a lot upon the laurel that the rolecop confirms his role, i.e. the existence of a rolecop should make his role more reasonable to exist. While this is not strictly true, it is somewhat true that a rolecop makes more sense with a miller in the game. Jailkeeper isn't a particularly useful role to find because it can easily be scum; vig is a role that confirms itself anyway. There isn't a whole lot of utility for a rolecop in this game with only vanilla townies alive other than myself, even if there's some scum who gives a positive. <br>\n<br>\nNext there's the claim itself, i.e. the whole \"i'm not a vt\" debacle. That way of claiming just adds obstacles as scum - if he gets lynched that day, he has to explain why he wasn't nightkilled or why nothing else strange happened because he's obviously going to claim that he was trying to draw a nightkill. <br>\n<br>\nHis Vinkah/OS tunnel comprises literally the entirety of his d3. It's either town who was just caught in what turned out to be a bad tunnel, or scum resting on their laurels. I guess he could have been trying to defend Nacho from being the next likely lynch target but I don't feel like defending Nacho would be super high priority for the scum at that point. I think the tunnel seems more likely from town given that he had a very detailed case at the start of the day - I can see it as very reasonable for town to have tunneled that deeply, but I think RC-scum would have given himself at least some outs. If OS is lynched and flips town of course that makes RC look bad. If Nacho were lynched and flipped scum, that would also make him look bad even though he'd been putting some suspicion on Nacho because he'd been tunneling the other wagon so hard. It just doesn't make that much sense. <br>\n<br>\nAnother thing that pinged town was the series of posts from <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7156198#p7156198\">2124</a>-2130. The emotion felt genuine to me and it did feel to me like that particular series of posts made him look like very clear town at least at face value, so 2129 in particular felt genuine to me. The posts after that where he's mocking OS about his miller claim too. His overall attitude in that exchange just feels like it comes from town.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nThe point of  a rolecop over a traditional cop is that a rolecop doenst make or break you unless you lied/have a blatantly scum role. Yes, miller makes a lot of sense given it,  but I think its more likely a check for the vig/sk chance and the one scum.<br>\n<br>\nTwo, I think the claiming \"not a vt\" thing is something either alignment would do, and I'm pretty sure that there were a LOT of people pushing oversoul about the way he did it too. It is just massive wifom. <br>\n<br>\nThree, if he just stopped his oversoul push when the going got rough on Nacho it would draw all sorts of weird looks. Did you see how hard nacho was fighting to have oversoul get lynched? How he repeatedly said to just let PRs sort it out? The reason he was pushing it so hard was likely to keep you from shooting another one of his buddies down the road (see, the current debacle we're in: if you still had a shot, we could lynch RC, if he flips town you can shoot wicked and that leaves one scum left in 3p lylo). I frankly don't see a way that scum-RC could have gotten out of that vote, given how opportunistic it felt coming into that day, an opportunistic abandoning would just make it worse. <br>\n<br>\nI kinda see your point about those random posts, but I really kinda hate the way he has treated my slot all game.<br>\n<br>\nSo idk.<br>\n<br>\npedit-<br>\n<br>\nBecause he crumbed it earlier? Because he could have (like ffery just said) had a gf on his team and been anticipating a traditional cop? He claimed after you.

I don't recall her doing or showing much of anything curiosity-wise.</div></blockquote><br>\nHAHA<br>\n<br>\nI actually lol'd when I read this.  \"as objective as the setup\"?  that's about as blatantly false as it's possible for anything to be blatantly false, and you know this.  you don't just accept claims because they appear to fit into the setup - you have to consider their actual play, or why they might have claimed it as scum, or so forth.  and you're continuing to handwave dismiss all the scenarios I literally just pointed out in one of my recent posts where it would make sense for a miller claim to be scum in this gamestate and push that it makes you town anyway.  so, no.<br>\n<br>\nwhat you're pushing here is essentially the same sort of thing as blindly following a cop clear in 3p LYLO just bc it's a cop clear.  which is flat-out wrong no matter how you try to put it.  you fucking evaluate their play vs. the other person's play and figure out if it makes sense for them to be scum who's been incorrectly cleared<br>\n<br>\nand if you're going to blatantly lie about what I've done this game, at the very least don't make it obvious.  me doing setup spec and not magically concluding you're town off it doesn't mean I haven't done any setup spec this game.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nYou know that show \"That's So Raven!\"? They should make a show called \"That's So Pie!\"...<br>\n<br>\nSo role flips aren't objective in pie's world. When I say, \"Tammy flipped role cop\", that's not objectively true. When I say, \"I made a breadcrumb in my first post\", that's not objectively true. I guess her sense of objectivity is guessing at motivations or play. <br>\n<br>\nAll I have to say is that we know pie wants to change the argument away from the setup. She can't dispute that point. Every time I bring up my role, she wants to go back and say \"no, only your play counts\". <br>\n<br>\nIf you only count my play, if you discount the setup, the roles, the mod, the flips... then I am scum. I can't beat pie on play. I can't twist my activity in this game to make it look good. I'm not even going to try. If I am lynched this game, it's because the basis was on me making the wrong choices with my votes and attacks throughout this game. <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>pie 3204 wrote:</cite>RC's attitude shift from \"o my gawd, you all have a tough decision on your hands, I wouldn't blame you for thinking I'm scum\" to \"pie is scum bc she didn't look at the setup and conclude that I'm town\"</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nThere's no shift. There's no shift. These aren't mutually inconsistent. <br>\n<br>\nI continue to hold the first POV. If I were in your shoes, I'd think that I was scum. I fully expected you, ns and ffrey to vote me today.<br>\n<br>\nAnd pie, the reason I voted you was not because you didn't conclude that I was town. I reread that post you made earlier and you said flat out that you didn't give a shit about my claim. There's a BIG difference between, \"I recognize your claim, let me consider how it fits you, the setup, the mod and the roles that have already flipped because I am a townie that cares about making the right voting decision\" and \"You're scum and I don't give a shit what you claim\".", "time": "Fri Sep 04, 2015 3:21 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=62686&start=3200", "forum": "53", "thread": "62686"}

It's essentially a low-risk play that distances them from each other and allows them to display a town-ish level of conviction that can't be discredited (because they're both correct in scum reading each other) nor can it anger an opponent (because they're attacking each other). This works as long as they are good enough to execute - and I think they <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">are</div> both good enough to do this. At first, I thought they were both town so the exchange was weird, but I didn't think that it could be bussing. I have a blind spot for bussing and it didn't occur to me that I was overlooking the possibility until Oversoul/implosion flipped town/not-mafia. If I had town read one and scum read the other, then my town read on the former would have strengthened greatly from this. For context, note that notscience almost got lynched the day beforehand, pie wasn't part of that bandwagon, and pie wasn't ever the popular townread that you or Tammy were. <br>\n<br>\nNacho bus... doesn't give me any reason to doubt that one or both of them are scum.

I hadn't played with him, but I knew he had a reputable scum game. I'm usually cautious in reading experienced players with strong scum games, but I could tell pretty quickly that he was town in that game. Next to Tammy, he might have been my strongest read in that game just because he felt <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">so</div> genuine. I <div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">never</div> got that same feeling from his early play in this game. <br>\n<br>\nI reached a point where I couldn't really do anything with (a) and I was worried that (b) might just be an experience change - swag town was two years ago I think. I also thought that his below-average effort + strange attitude would be town tells for him given his preference for scum. In retrospect, these 'tells' could be things he knows to exploit given his experience with everyone in this game and also considering his partner Nacho was the one designated to read him. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\nFastforward to the end of day 2 where he claimed miller. I ended up town reading him for this (because it seemed like a bizarre move to make as scum), but, as I explained before, the crumb was an awful decision for him if he was actually a town miller. In retrospect, I should have been more skeptical and more open-minded than to immediately assume 'too scummy to be scum'. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\nOn days 3 and 4, RC felt genuinely sick of this game but this was still a side of him unfamiliar to me.
