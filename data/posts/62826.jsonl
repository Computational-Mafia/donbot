Loose paraphrasing should be fine.<br>iii) Excessive coarse language should not be directed at other players. Frustration is natural, but keep it in check.<br>iv) Don't impersonate the mod. They won't edit other people's posts except to fix tags; they won't leave other comments.<br>v) Cryptography and steganography are forbidden, as are any forms of provable randomness (e.g. dice tags, random.org screenshots).<br>vi) If you have outside information which alters your knowledge of the game or suspect the game has been compromised, contact the mod immediately.<br>vii) Don't exploit technicalities or ambiguities in any of the rules to do something you should know is forbidden or unethical.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Matters of Life and Death</span><br><br>viii) A vote or unvote is valid so long as it contains the word 'vote' or 'unvote' directly followed by a player's name or 'no lynch', all in instantly readable unquoted bold text.<br>ix) Abbreviations or misspellings of a player's name or 'no lynch' are valid whilst voting, so long as they are unambiguous.<br>x) Votes and unvotes are invalid if they come from any account not listed as alive and presently in the game.<br>xi) A lynch occurs when a player receives greater than 50% of all votes. <br>xii) A no lynch occurs when greater than or equal to 50% of all votes are placed in favour.<br>xiii) Players may continue talking after a lynch or no lynch has occurred until the mod announces it.<br>xiv) Once the mod has announced their death, a player may not post further. This includes 'bah' posts.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Actions, Activity, and Deadlines</span><br><br>xv) The lengths of Day and Night phases are up to the mod but will generally be between 5 and 14 days and 48 and 72 hours respectively.<br>xvi) If the Day deadline expires without a majority of votes on a player, nobody dies and the game moves into Night.<br>xvii) If Day or Night actions are not submitted via PM or in bold in a mod-provided PT before deadline, they do not resolve.<br>xviii) Players who do not wish to perform an available Day or Night action should submit 'no action' or risk being replaced.<br>xix) Deadlines are extended only in exceptional circumstances or if a player needs replacement. No phase ends until all slots are occupied.<br>xx) Players who do not post for 48 hours will be prodded. Not responding to a prod within 48 hours or receiving 4 prods will see that player replaced.<br>xxi) If a player expects to be unable to post for upwards of 48 hours, they should declare V/LA legibly, in bold, in-thread, to avoid being prodded.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Miscellaneous</span><br><br>xxii) When in doubt, ask the mod.<br>xxiii) Flavour will never have any significance, hidden or otherwise, to the game.<br>xxiv) Punishment for breaking the rules is determined on a case-by-case basis, and may range from a warning to a modkill or replacement.<br>xxv) The mod reserves the right to add, modify, or remove rules as necessary, but will not change relevant rules during or after the fact.</ul>"}

You know what I mean by that. There is no need to explain that further. Town reads are easy because scum know who town are, therefore they can phone in content by saying \"This guy is town for this really dumb reason that doesn't make sense from a town point of view.\" <br><br>2. Usually, scum go for the consensus, easier for scum to join on along. Simple as that.<br><br>3. You were already pushing on Veegee, yet it wasn't the most convincing. Do remember that finding scum isn't a black and white thing. One scumtell does not apply globally. I suspect you for different reasons. You are active but that doesn't mean you are town. You have been tunneling Veegee, only to say that you are confident in Pistapantalones. (Which I after you responded to my question about your confidence) <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7109691#p7109691\" class=\"postlink\">#70</a> Are you saying you are town for pushing Veegee, who you were 'town reading' and voted to a claim for 'seeming' like he was going to do an action that you did not even observe? <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7115375#p7115375\" class=\"postlink\">#176</a> These last two sentences show that your actions have been bullshit. You didn't really believe Pistapasta was scum, you were simply wagoning to wagon, while putting a townread to claim, <span style=\"font-style: italic\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">for something he did not do</span></span>. <br><br><br>4. Obviously I give emphasis to explaining reads, <span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"font-style: italic\">always</span></span>. You trying to use that as a point against me is ridiculous. It's pro-town to explain your suspicions votes. Asking for explanation is null though, and I do it regardless of alignment. You would have a stronger point IF I was only asking people to explain their reads on me and nothing else, but do remember Mustachio was town reading me, when I asked for thoughts on the rest of the cast. Her content seemed easy and <span style=\"font-style: italic\">fakeable</span>. Not mine.<br><br>5. If you had explained it earlier, you be able to understand what I was saying. Yet you just ignored it to keep a scumread on me, and now will see that you are <span style=\"font-style: italic\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">wrong</span></span>. Maybe you'd be able to realize that I'm <span style=\"font-style: italic\">town</span> if you actually talked with me, but you chose to ignore my explanation, which is a scumsided mindset. I asked her why she hasn't interacted with him, to show that she's developing a scumread on him, to show that she has concerns with him. I was in no way insinuating they were partners. I was saying she didn't do much to show she really had concerns with him, she just came in, stated why she was suspecting him, a major wagon, and that's it. Again, her doing so with only one town read, seems <span style=\"font-style: italic\">fake</span>. Not what I said at all. Obviously when I was interacting with her, I was trying to see what her thoughts were, and it had nothing to do with people's suspicion on me, no?  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\"> <br><br>---<br><br>I know you didn't, you dodged my question. That's what the parathesis was for, which you conveniently cut out of the quote to misrepresent me. I do change reads! Yet only when a person gives me reason to. Someone claiming vt isn't a reason to back off of someone, especially if you are confident they are scum. Yet you don't care about that. No you didn't say 'claims should be in the open', but your play is trying to run everyone to claim. Also, by itself the 'coco is town' isn't suspicious, yet it is concerning when you take into account your interaction with Coco. I was looking back to the pianta post and noticed that on re-read, and I brought it up. Problem? Also disregard the 'longwinded' thing, you just misunderstood me. That's not the problem. Was just giving context."}

No issues with someone moving to what they feel is a stronger vote, but the lack of commentary felt unusual, given the timing. Overall, VeeGee primarily reads like an awkward newbie, the difficulty being that he offers very little explanation for anything he does, which makes him inscrutable when he does things like call pist town in #174, then re-vote her in #194. #203 also looks like him attempting to subtly push people into voting pistachi0n - not an overt call to vote, more of a \"hey guys, just saying\" which, to his mind might seem less scummy than an outright push. Ultimately though a lot of his early posts show a little bit of a glimmer of independent thought, and I want to believe #174 shows that as well.

(Earlier she gave a townread on Bacde without reasoning, yet said nothing of the wagon) To me it seemed she did this to appease Bacde, yet did not care to defend him.

Bacde flipping town, makes the interaction null because that was just an observation of the interaction, not the actions individually. Currently I'm reading Thor as null. This is also something I'd expect Thor to do Regardless of alignment, and I sometimes have trouble reading him. So I just focus else where and let his play, play out to read him better. How are you reading Thor, and Pistachio? What's the reasoning?<br><br>On scum being on the wagon, your slot had been voting Bacde without doing much else. He also, scumread Veegee, while scumreading Bacde for attacking him at the same time. Basically, he scumread on both sides of the argument. Your slots vote was on the wagon, when he replaced. He left it on, while Veegee hammered without waiting for more responses, even a replacement. I scumread your slot earlier for doing only that, and being in the shadows. That still counts against your slot, yet I am very interested in seeing what you have to offer, and have you at null. I will re-consider your slot after seeing more content from you."}

Sometimes scum are active, sometimes they are inactive. In the example of Pistachion, she purposely has been absent (after claiming, she didn't post much, nor did Drakc post much either), with questions unanswered. You can tell if the town is one that scum are pretty active or if scum seem to be inactive. You won't be able to find scum just by ignoring lurkers, ever. I just always look at people who are suspicious to me, active or lurker. In a lurker town like this, that observation you gave is unfair. The key point is never to just vote someone for only being inactive. If the player has posts and content in thread, they can be read from that. Look at my scumread on Drackd, I could not read him further because he was just sitting there, and I looked else where. Now Jazz has replaced in and i'm talking to her, to develop a read on her. I still have a null read on her but I stated out right that I do not trust her slot. I think you'll understand more as you grow as a mafia player."}

I was town-reading Bacde because I didn't think it was likely that a scum player would be so aggressive on Day 1.

She was quick to label people as town or scum, and generally made herself very conspicuous. So I thought she was town."}

It doesn't read at all like, 'oh, I'm surprised that Catboi was NK'd\".  <br><br>Regards,<br>Jazz</div></blockquote><br><br>Yeah okay he \"was\" Cop. How am I supposed to say it? He IS cop?

So, why on, earth would I want to kill someone that I could lynch later? There's nothing that indicates to me that he was cop in /anyway/. I was just more then shocked that the one person that was skilled N1 - was Cop.

The contractor started today with ripping out the carpet and underpad and baseboards and tack-strips (or whatever those things are called that go around the room to keep carpet tight and grounded) in two bedrooms and the hallway upstairs, which means that they had to move all of the furniture from those rooms into the other two bedrooms upstairs (one of which is the room I use at home as an 'office' type of room with my desk, computer, etc. so it's pretty crowded in here at the moment with closet doors, boxes, a mattress, a bed frame, headboard, etc., etc., (I should take a picture - it's insane) but I managed to clear a path to my desk/computer/monitor.  Tomorrow (Friday), the contractor is laying the new wood floors in those two bedrooms and the hallway, and then moving the furniture back to those rooms, and then moving my master bedroom and 'office' furniture so that they can rip out the carpet, underpad, etc., from these rooms as well as the two upstairs bathrooms so I will be without my desk and everything tomorrow night.  On Saturday and Sunday, they will install the new wood flooring and baseboards and such in these four rooms (as well as the staircase between the first floor and second floor) and then move the furniture from these rooms back again.  So, I should be back to (what qualifies as) 'normal' some time on Sunday.

The fact that mafia has not for higher contributing players like Ran and Boon... hm</div></blockquote><br>Well, in a way, it would make sense if Ran and Thor are the scum team.   I am town, and if you are too, they would want to leave Boon alive because of his silly nonsense on Day 2 declaring that the scum team is you and me.   They would expect that Boon would come willy-nilly into Day 3 bound and determined to lynch either you or me without putting any real thought into the game (because Boon doesn't do real thought), and all they would need is for Boon to cast a vote on either you or me and they could clinch the win for the scum team.  So, they would want to keep Boon, you, and me alive, which would have left nobody else for them to NK but VeeGee during Night 2.  For other reasons that I'm not going to go into right now, though, I have reason to doubt that it is a Ran/Thor scum team.   More on this later after I think about it some more and after we see what happens over the next several days that we have available to discuss matters.<br><br>That said, it could also make sense if Ran and Boon are the scum team, and Ran does not appear to be playing his town game in this game.  While Ran tiptoes around you, first defending you, then sorta kinda calling you out as scum when he thought it necessary, and then sorta kinda soft-defending you again later, Boon does his silly routine, in which case though why NK VeeGee instead of Thor?   I will have to think about that and look back at VeeGee's suspicions and such.   <br><br>It could also make sense if Thor and Boon are the scum team.  Thor takes no strong positions thoughout the game, leaves it to Boon to be the OTT one (interspersed with lurking on Boon's part which he does strategically as scum), and then can't NK either you or me after Boon's silly nonsense on D2, and the choice then is either Ran or VeeGee.  I'm not sure why that potential team would choose to NK VeeGee over Ran - I will have to think about that some more as well and re-read everyone individually.<br><br>It could also make sense if the scum team is you and one of Ran or Thor, and to a lesser extent, Boon.  Ugh, I'm going to have to go do a whole bunch of re-reading and vote analysis and such.   On the up side, though, we have a minimum of 9 days to work through all of this and there is no excuse for anyone to vote prematurely, so that's a big plus for those of us who are town.<br><br>Also, bear in mind that there's a heaping helping of WIFOM constantly available in all of this sort of thought process.  I'm just thinking out loud at the moment.   We have a minimum of 9 days to try to work things out so nobody should vote anybody yet, and we need everyone here to hash things so, including Thor who is V/LA for the next 9 days.<br><br>Regards,<br>Jazz"}

Thor would seem like a likely candidate, but when I think about it, the last time I have seen him as scum, he vibed as malicious, here he does not vibe the same way. He's just null, and not there. This puts it betweeen Boon and Drackd for me. Now Boon votes Bacde for a dumb reason, which is not something I'd find scum to do. The most suspicious is Drackd's vote here, as he has been pretty silent through out the early game, talking about two people who were the talk of the town (popular consensus). Both flipped town. He replaced out yet left his vote on. Jazz did not have time to take it off, so it's on her as a person, but on her slot though. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7154467#p7154467\" class=\"postlink\">post 585</a>, Quilford wrote:</cite><ul><span style=\"padding-left:0.1in\"></span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Votecount 2.9</span></span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">&gt;&gt;&gt; <span style=\"color: #00BF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">pistachi0n</span></span> (4)\u2014 Thor665, <span style=\"color: #00BF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Ranmaru</span></span>, xCoco, Boonskiies &lt;&lt;&lt;</span><br>xCoco (1)\u2014 <span style=\"color: #00BF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">pistachi0n</span></span><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic\">Not Voting</span> (2)\u2014 Jazzmyn, <span style=\"color: #00BF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">VeeGee</span></span><br><br>At 4 votes, a lynch has been achieved.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Deadline</span><br><br>A lynch has been secured before deadline.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Mod notes</span><br><br>Flip incoming...</ul></div></blockquote><br><br>On the wagon, is Thor, Coco, and Boon. Thor, to me is still null, voting Pista without any reconsideration, yet I find it in character of Thor, who even has voted myself on a D3 of another game, without any reason (when I had read him as town I think), and he was town, and so was I. Coco, is on the wagon this time, yet took really long to get on, and needed direction. Yet the next day, Coco blames me (again) by saying that I was just trying to 'get her to vote Pista'. What she doesn't realize here, is that it was a lynch between Coco or Pista. I was only trying to get a lynch, since others were not voting to avoid no lynch, yet she doesn't realize this being a newbie. Yet she tries to use this as reasoning doubt me, which is very suspicious. Boon, hammered Pista when pushing for Coco/Jazz. Due to this, I'd look into Boon if it were not Coco and Jazz. Yet, I see this as very wifomy action if the team was Coco/Boon. This is why I feel it's better to lynch Coco today, to get one scum, and be able to have a chance at finding the other after.<br><br>Next, I want to mention Jazz is off the wagon here. Remember that she has been acting pretty wishy washy here, while not coming to a solid conclusion at all. I also want to mention, that each night kill has narrowed it down to a way that puts doubt on Jazz and Coco. Coco being a newbie, I would not expect for her to kill in this way, this could only be possible if she was paired with a person who was experienced. The kills also shed more doubt on the people on the wagon, because the pool is larger on the wagon rather than off the wagon.<br><br>Jazz has also scumread Coco, yet unvote her and never concluded her read on COco, looking at Boon and Pista ahead of her. Jazz had also been playing the waiting game, and had been wishy washy when it came to Coco. She has dropped the Catboi 'slip' altogether.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7145661#p7145661\" class=\"postlink\">post 467</a>, Jazzmyn wrote:</cite>Upon rereading and further meta-diving, I think I want to vote for either pistachion or Thor.<br><br>*time passes*<br><br>*thinks about it some more*<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Unvote</span><br><br>*still don't know which way to go, I will have to sleep on it*<br><br>Regards,<br>Jazz</div></blockquote><br><br>Jazz is wishy washy here. She moves away from Coco here, without any conclusion on Coco (not that I can remember). This is upon looking at Thor's and Pista's meta, and what I don't get is why say that about Thor if she looked at HIS meta? I know his meta, and can tell it apart sort of. I have played with him at least 3 times, 2 time she was town and 1 time he was mafia, and we lynched him when he was mafia (thanks to MoI). I don't see that from his play this game at all, and I would love to see why Jazz thinks this.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7150661#p7150661\" class=\"postlink\">post 540</a>, Jazzmyn wrote:</cite>Oh, crap.

When she flips scum, we look into Jazz. The connections are there for them. Thor doesn't seem like buddies with her, because he had a slight scum lean that grew into a scum read. The only other thing is that he has been less present so there  is nothing to show if his future actions are genuine, because there was less of that. Yet reading him individually, I don't see any suspiciousness. Boon does not seem like scum with her, as I feel his interaction with her was too brash, when he was instigating her to vote. Yet he would be the next likely scumspect if Jazz was not scum. This is because of his hammer, which he said was to show that Coco/Jazz was the team. He has the weird hammer, and Jazz has the silent drop of Coco, pushing Boon and Pista ahead of her.<br><br>I have shown why Coco is scum from her individual actions, and through VCA. She is the last piece of the puzzle, and she should be lynched ToDay."}

When she flips scum, we look into Jazz. The connections are there for them. Thor doesn't seem like buddies with her, because he had a slight scum lean that grew into a scum read. The only other thing is that he has been less present so there  is nothing to show if his future actions are genuine, because there was less of that. Yet reading him individually, I don't see any suspiciousness. Boon does not seem like scum with her, as I feel his interaction with her was too brash, when he was instigating her to vote. Yet he would be the next likely scumspect if Jazz was not scum. This is because of his hammer, which he said was to show that Coco/Jazz was the team. He has the weird hammer, and Jazz has the silent drop of Coco, pushing Boon and Pista ahead of her. <br><br>I have shown why Coco is scum from her individual actions, and through VCA.

Another question how am I the last piece of the puzzle you realize we likely have 2 mafia?

And the point of town is to lynch scum. What is your point? Let me clarify. You did not say it was my fault, but your post implied it was. That was the suspicious part. Knowing that I had no part in you coming to the read of Pista, you still said \"Would be ridiculous if ran was scum 'leading me on to pista'\" (this is a paraphrase)<br><br>Point taken.

I really do not understand the purpose of rushing down to put a vote.</div></blockquote><br><br>Let me re-state. You were the only person to not be voting *at all*. Voting is not 'rushing'. Voting pre-maturely without any evidence can possibly be rushing, yet you already had two scumreads, yet you did nothing with them. You chose to sit on your butt for the whole day and let others talk, when you yourself would be one who is active as town. Town is not afraid to throw a vote out, as it helps them get reactions and reads. Yes, you were playing splatoon with me just recently but you only responded to this post immediately. You are being selective with how you post. You respond more on defense, rather then being pro-active.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Frame? Purposely wait?  I already said I wasn\u2019t sure if it counted for anything and it was MY point of view.  Stop jumping to conclusions.  I didn\u2019t go \u201cRan told me to vote for Pista\u201d or \u201cRan is scum because he told me to vote for Pista and she flipped town\u201d Also why did you quote Pista\u2019s VOTE on me.  To me it looks like \u2018hey vote this person because they voted for you\u2019 if you wanted me to consider Pista either scum hunting or surviving you would have quoted something ELSE.  The other wagon was me and of course I do not want to get lynched.</div></blockquote><br><br>You saying 'I'm not sure' is also wishy washy. It shows you are being intentionally vague while implying that I was trying to do that. Why point that out if you are unsure? Why not vote me? You are only point it out to seed doubt, without having to do that much work, in hopes others may agree and you can jump on later. Pista's vote on you seemed very survivelistic, plus there was nothing else I could show that was recent, because *she wasn't posting*. On 'jumping to conclusions', I am pretty sure I have considered all the angles here, and did plenty of work to come to this conclusion. I'm not being hasty at all here.<br><br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Squints. You ask me to share my reads? And then use them against me?

Again, you did a 180* on people YOU found probably townie. THAT'S NOT OK. Also, my new scum read on you was my follow up to this post. There is no need for a 'thank you for your reads', but you can imagine that I did say that.

I town read you early \u2013 but that might change later.  You might slip up or do something scummy.  I am not a power role \u2013 so I can only analyze what you say.

There is no need for thoughts for you to do your own thing, you need to be a little bit more independent in your scumhunting.

That is what I'm doing.  It takes time, but we have an extended deadline of at least a week at present (due to your extended V/LA) so nobody is going to be voting anyone any time soon, and I intend to use the time to work meticulously through the entire thread to work out who is scum.    Ranmaru is climbing up the charts at present.  He is most certainly misrepresenting things in his recent posts, and it does not look accidental on his part.  I intend to deconstruct his misrepresentations in great detail over the next day or two as time permits.  Boon still looks pretty sketchy too. I am quite pleased that your V/LA has given the rest of us plenty of time to try to suss this game out.  <br><br>Oh, I suppose I could have just typed something like this instead:  in the time it took you to post your meaningless post, you could have posted your thoughts and reads now that we in lylo, or perhaps you could have posted some response to my posts 600, 601, 602, or even some response to other posts.   <br><br>See how easy (and unproductive) it is to simply snipe from the sidelines?<br><br>Regards,<br>Jazz"}

You unilaterally made a call for a Popcorn massclaim without any reasoning whatsoever.  I responded that I think other methods would be more beneficial to town and that others should not follow you willy nilly just because you say so.   I suggested other methods of massclaim, and you have ignored that entirely - while not addressing any of my posts in any meaningful fashion whatsoever.   Reading your ISO, your entire posting history in this game is riddled with weak, fluffy, non-committal stuff dressed up to pretend to have substance, but upon review it has no substance at all.   You have voted for townies repeatedly, ignored substantive posts entirely,  ignored scummy behaviour by Ran and Boon entirely, and misrepresented townies repeatedly.    In short, your body of work is comprised of scummy posts trying very hard to look like they have substance but, upon scrutiny, they are appear terribly superficial and fakedy fake.  You don't actually say anything meaningful; you don't actually address what has been said; you seem to think that sidestepping the actual discussion and making vague and meaningless accusations against others or asking pointless \"questions\" of others is sufficient to skate through the game.  It isn't.   It's empty.  It's meaningless.  It's scummy.  <br><br>You have voted to lynch town players at every opportunity (Drak/Pistachion/Bacde).  You called Boon town, which is utterly laughable.

You have voted for townies repeatedly, ignored substantive posts entirely,  ignored scummy behaviour by Ran and Boon entirely, and misrepresented townies repeatedly.    In short, your body of work is comprised of scummy posts trying very hard to look like they have substance but, upon scrutiny, they are appear terribly superficial and fakedy fake.

I especially wanted input on these questions from the two of the four of you who are town but it has been like pulling teeth.  None of you have really commented on preferred approaches (you just advocated popcorn without considering or commenting on the other methods and without commenting on my posts about the alternatives) and none of you have provided any reasoning for popcorn over the other methods or the two step method.  <br>And I don't understand that because two of you have to be town.  I can understand why the scum don't want to talk about it, but I don't understand why town doesn't.<br> <br>I don't mind claiming and I haven't been opposed to doing so from the start, but it feels like the game is being scum-driven and that the town is succumbing to apathy when players don't respond to legitimate inquiries or provide legitimate reasons in support of their own suggestions.  When that happens, I am less inclined to just go along with a suggestion that appears to be scum-driven, without pushing back instead.   <br><br>I take it from your advocacy of the popcorn methodology that you think it is the best way to proceed.   If you think that is the best way to proceed, can you please articulate <span class=\"noboldsig\">why</span> you think that is so in the present situation and why you think the other suggestions are less beneficial to town?  I may very well agree with you if you explain to me why you think that popcorn is the best method and why you think the other methodologies are less beneficial, but without any explanation or discussion, I am left scratching my head, I'm afraid.    Work with me here, please.    I am trying to help pull out a town win here in very poor circumstances but I do not feel like I am getting much help at all.<br><br>Regards,<br>Jazz"}

Reading comprehension is something I struggle with (just reading in general esp reading other players).  I didn't know if I should or should not because Jazz suggested that I don't and I don't think listening to her was a great idea, which winded in me taking to long because I wanted to see if others would agree or disagree. (I don't remember if they did; I need to double check) I should have just gone with the majority - I also have never done this popcorn or mass-claim before so I made a bunch of errors on my part.  I think I also made the mistake of claiming too fast and Jazz called me out on it so I became hesitant.<br><br>Also bring on the anemia puns.<br><br>If Thor is town (I'm trusting Boon and Thor...) then scum could be Jazz/Ran.

She went to visit friends of hers in the U.S. for a few days (we are Canadian and live in southern Ontario, and she often visits her close friends in the U.S., including these particular friends who are also Canadian but moved to Michigan a couple of years ago) but while there she suffered a massive seizure of some kind out of the blue as she has no medical history of such, so she was taken by ambulance to a hospital in Grand Rapids, Michigan.  Upon learning of this, it meant me embarking on a 6 hour drive to the hospital out of country, and subsequent follow up and dealing with the hospital and doctors etc., trying to arrange to get her transferred to Ontario once she was stable, which took several days.   She is back in Ontario now, and stable thankfully, but there is a whole lot still going on as she is undergoing a battery of tests and procedures to try to sort out what happened and why she would suddenly have a massive seizure like that out of the blue.   She is supposed to start back to school next week (in her final year of university) but we now have a bunch of medical procedures and tests (CT, brain MRI, and a whole host of others) scheduled and it is not clear whether or not she will be able to start back to school next week at all, but here's hoping.  <br><br>In the circumstances, I have been unable to participate in any of my 3 ongoing games and, given the uncertainty of the immediate future and given that my daughter's health and wellbeing are the most important things on the planet to me, and given that I am freaked out and sort of overwhelmed as a result of all of this, and given that I have slept very little for the past several days, I think it is probably best if take a break for the foreseeable future and replace out of all of my games at present.<br><br>I am very sorry for any inconvenience that this may have caused.  <br><br>As an aside with respect to this game specifically (although I have not been able to read the game or any game for that matter since last week), the fact is that I am 100% town and Boon is 100% lying when he claims otherwise (if he is still claiming otherwise).  Townies:  please remember that this is Lylo; the two scum can't lynch me without help from a Townie and both of the scum do not want to be seen as trying to lynch me when they know that they need at least one Townie to help them.

Drackd did not do much, and gave two opinions on Bacde and Veegee early game, even though he had no unique opinions of his own. Replaced out, Jazz came in.

From there, she drops the push and doesn't state a town read of Coco until after. Salamence comes in, gives a good observation and ignores from reading Coco at all. To me, the slot was having a hard time to scumhunt at all, and had to replace out. Jazz comes in seeming like she is doing some good work but it doesn't go anywhere. Then she argues about whether or not claiming was a good thing, and stalled her claim without really pushing more of who she felt had to go today.<br><br>Also, Coco and I have started school recently so we have been a bit busier.

Drackd was non-existent but his vote remained on Bacde, through the lynch and replacement. His vote on Coco was RVS, but it wasn't rvs at that point.<br>3.

We would have had the same reaction as the two of you if the roles were reversed. It's how 1v1's work, except in this case, it was 2v2. If you aren't scum, then it's pretty much confirmed in your eyes that the other is. Thor was on the outside, and had no way of knowing for sure who it was."}

We knew there was a cop and doctor, and obviously we tried to find them. Correctly guessed Catboi, and killed him because I didn't want to deal with whatever he would catch up with. Boon wanted me to counterclaim but I read the mood of the town and simply claimed vt to seem more town. We also killed in a way (except the last night) to narrow down the pr pool since Bacde pushed for claims early. That really helped us find the cop.<br><br>So by then we knew it was either Jazz or Thor. Seeing them both claim vt, it made sense that I'd also claim vt. I also took Coco's play as a an opportunity to frame her, while knowing that she was busy. Also, she should post more actively without being voted/forced. She still kind of floats around as town until pushed, and she will react as you have seen. Need to improve on that. I think she can get a better idea of how to find scum now."}
