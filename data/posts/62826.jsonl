Loose paraphrasing should be fine.<br>\niii) Excessive coarse language should not be directed at other players. Frustration is natural, but keep it in check.<br>\niv) Don't impersonate the mod. They won't edit other people's posts except to fix tags; they won't leave other comments.<br>\nv) Cryptography and steganography are forbidden, as are any forms of provable randomness (e.g. dice tags, random.org screenshots).<br>\nvi) If you have outside information which alters your knowledge of the game or suspect the game has been compromised, contact the mod immediately.<br>\nvii) Don't exploit technicalities or ambiguities in any of the rules to do something you should know is forbidden or unethical.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Matters of Life and Death</div><br>\n<br>\nviii) A vote or unvote is valid so long as it contains the word 'vote' or 'unvote' directly followed by a player's name or 'no lynch', all in instantly readable unquoted bold text.<br>\nix) Abbreviations or misspellings of a player's name or 'no lynch' are valid whilst voting, so long as they are unambiguous.<br>\nx) Votes and unvotes are invalid if they come from any account not listed as alive and presently in the game.<br>\nxi) A lynch occurs when a player receives greater than 50% of all votes. <br>\nxii) A no lynch occurs when greater than or equal to 50% of all votes are placed in favour.<br>\nxiii) Players may continue talking after a lynch or no lynch has occurred until the mod announces it.<br>\nxiv) Once the mod has announced their death, a player may not post further. This includes 'bah' posts.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Actions, Activity, and Deadlines</div><br>\n<br>\nxv) The lengths of Day and Night phases are up to the mod but will generally be between 5 and 14 days and 48 and 72 hours respectively.<br>\nxvi) If the Day deadline expires without a majority of votes on a player, nobody dies and the game moves into Night.<br>\nxvii) If Day or Night actions are not submitted via PM or in bold in a mod-provided PT before deadline, they do not resolve.<br>\nxviii) Players who do not wish to perform an available Day or Night action should submit 'no action' or risk being replaced.<br>\nxix) Deadlines are extended only in exceptional circumstances or if a player needs replacement. No phase ends until all slots are occupied.<br>\nxx) Players who do not post for 48 hours will be prodded. Not responding to a prod within 48 hours or receiving 4 prods will see that player replaced.<br>\nxxi) If a player expects to be unable to post for upwards of 48 hours, they should declare V/LA legibly, in bold, in-thread, to avoid being prodded.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Miscellaneous</div><br>\n<br>\nxxii) When in doubt, ask the mod.<br>\nxxiii) Flavour will never have any significance, hidden or otherwise, to the game.<br>\nxxiv) Punishment for breaking the rules is determined on a case-by-case basis, and may range from a warning to a modkill or replacement.<br>\nxxv) The mod reserves the right to add, modify, or remove rules as necessary, but will not change relevant rules during or after the fact.</li></ul>", "time": "Tue Jul 28, 2015 3:03 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=62826&start=0", "forum": "53", "thread": "62826"}

Town reads are easy because scum know who town are, therefore they can phone in content by saying \"This guy is town for this really dumb reason that doesn't make sense from a town point of view.\" <br>\n<br>\n2. Usually, scum go for the consensus, easier for scum to join on along. Simple as that.<br>\n<br>\n3. You were already pushing on Veegee, yet it wasn't the most convincing. Do remember that finding scum isn't a black and white thing. One scumtell does not apply globally. I suspect you for different reasons. You are active but that doesn't mean you are town. You have been tunneling Veegee, only to say that you are confident in Pistapantalones.

You didn't really believe Pistapasta was scum, you were simply wagoning to wagon, while putting a townread to claim, <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">for something he did not do</div></div>. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n4. Obviously I give emphasis to explaining reads, <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">always</div></div>. You trying to use that as a point against me is ridiculous. It's pro-town to explain your suspicions votes. Asking for explanation is null though, and I do it regardless of alignment. You would have a stronger point IF I was only asking people to explain their reads on me and nothing else, but do remember Mustachio was town reading me, when I asked for thoughts on the rest of the cast. Her content seemed easy and <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">fakeable</div>. Not mine.<br>\n<br>\n5. If you had explained it earlier, you be able to understand what I was saying. Yet you just ignored it to keep a scumread on me, and now will see that you are <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">wrong</div></div>. Maybe you'd be able to realize that I'm <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">town</div> if you actually talked with me, but you chose to ignore my explanation, which is a scumsided mindset. I asked her why she hasn't interacted with him, to show that she's developing a scumread on him, to show that she has concerns with him. I was in no way insinuating they were partners. I was saying she didn't do much to show she really had concerns with him, she just came in, stated why she was suspecting him, a major wagon, and that's it. Again, her doing so with only one town read, seems <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">fake</div>. Not what I said at all. Obviously when I was interacting with her, I was trying to see what her thoughts were, and it had nothing to do with people's suspicion on me, no?  <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\"> <br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\nI know you didn't, you dodged my question. That's what the parathesis was for, which you conveniently cut out of the quote to misrepresent me. I do change reads! Yet only when a person gives me reason to. Someone claiming vt isn't a reason to back off of someone, especially if you are confident they are scum. Yet you don't care about that. No you didn't say 'claims should be in the open', but your play is trying to run everyone to claim. Also, by itself the 'coco is town' isn't suspicious, yet it is concerning when you take into account your interaction with Coco. I was looking back to the pianta post and noticed that on re-read, and I brought it up. Problem? Also disregard the 'longwinded' thing, you just misunderstood me. That's not the problem.

No issues with someone moving to what they feel is a stronger vote, but the lack of commentary felt unusual, given the timing. Overall, VeeGee primarily reads like an awkward newbie, the difficulty being that he offers very little explanation for anything he does, which makes him inscrutable when he does things like call pist town in #174, then re-vote her in #194. #203 also looks like him attempting to subtly push people into voting pistachi0n - not an overt call to vote, more of a \"hey guys, just saying\" which, to his mind might seem less scummy than an outright push.

The contractor started today with ripping out the carpet and underpad and baseboards and tack-strips (or whatever those things are called that go around the room to keep carpet tight and grounded) in two bedrooms and the hallway upstairs, which means that they had to move all of the furniture from those rooms into the other two bedrooms upstairs (one of which is the room I use at home as an 'office' type of room with my desk, computer, etc. so it's pretty crowded in here at the moment with closet doors, boxes, a mattress, a bed frame, headboard, etc., etc., (I should take a picture - it's insane) but I managed to clear a path to my desk/computer/monitor.  Tomorrow (Friday), the contractor is laying the new wood floors in those two bedrooms and the hallway, and then moving the furniture back to those rooms, and then moving my master bedroom and 'office' furniture so that they can rip out the carpet, underpad, etc., from these rooms as well as the two upstairs bathrooms so I will be without my desk and everything tomorrow night.  On Saturday and Sunday, they will install the new wood flooring and baseboards and such in these four rooms (as well as the staircase between the first floor and second floor) and then move the furniture from these rooms back again.  So, I should be back to (what qualifies as) 'normal' some time on Sunday.  (I am also having the main floor flooring removed and redone but that is scheduled for the week of Labour Day, starting on Tuesday the 8th through Friday the 11th, and does not involve any disruption to my 'chill' space at all.   <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\"> )<br>\n<br>\nI expect that even though I won't be able to use my 'office' room tomorrow evening or Saturday, I should still be able to still get online via my home network somehow; I just have to figure out how.  <br>\n<br>\nAll of the above is just as a head's up, and just in case something goes wrong and I am unable to get on for some reason over the next couple of days, but I don't really expect the disruption caused by the renos to be of any serious consequence. <br>\n<br>\nPreview edit:  I took some pictures with my phone but I don't know how to display them here.

I am town, and if you are too, they would want to leave Boon alive because of his silly nonsense on Day 2 declaring that the scum team is you and me.   They would expect that Boon would come willy-nilly into Day 3 bound and determined to lynch either you or me without putting any real thought into the game (because Boon doesn't do real thought), and all they would need is for Boon to cast a vote on either you or me and they could clinch the win for the scum team.  So, they would want to keep Boon, you, and me alive, which would have left nobody else for them to NK but VeeGee during Night 2.  For other reasons that I'm not going to go into right now, though, I have reason to doubt that it is a Ran/Thor scum team.   More on this later after I think about it some more and after we see what happens over the next several days that we have available to discuss matters.<br>\n<br>\nThat said, it could also make sense if Ran and Boon are the scum team, and Ran does not appear to be playing his town game in this game.  While Ran tiptoes around you, first defending you, then sorta kinda calling you out as scum when he thought it necessary, and then sorta kinda soft-defending you again later, Boon does his silly routine, in which case though why NK VeeGee instead of Thor?   I will have to think about that and look back at VeeGee's suspicions and such.   <br>\n<br>\nIt could also make sense if Thor and Boon are the scum team.  Thor takes no strong positions thoughout the game, leaves it to Boon to be the OTT one (interspersed with lurking on Boon's part which he does strategically as scum), and then can't NK either you or me after Boon's silly nonsense on D2, and the choice then is either Ran or VeeGee.  I'm not sure why that potential team would choose to NK VeeGee over Ran - I will have to think about that some more as well and re-read everyone individually.<br>\n<br>\nIt could also make sense if the scum team is you and one of Ran or Thor, and to a lesser extent, Boon.  Ugh, I'm going to have to go do a whole bunch of re-reading and vote analysis and such.   On the up side, though, we have a minimum of 9 days to work through all of this and there is no excuse for anyone to vote prematurely, so that's a big plus for those of us who are town.<br>\n<br>\nAlso, bear in mind that there's a heaping helping of WIFOM constantly available in all of this sort of thought process.  I'm just thinking out loud at the moment.

Thor would seem like a likely candidate, but when I think about it, the last time I have seen him as scum, he vibed as malicious, here he does not vibe the same way. He's just null, and not there. This puts it betweeen Boon and Drackd for me. Now Boon votes Bacde for a dumb reason, which is not something I'd find scum to do. The most suspicious is Drackd's vote here, as he has been pretty silent through out the early game, talking about two people who were the talk of the town (popular consensus). Both flipped town. He replaced out yet left his vote on. Jazz did not have time to take it off, so it's on her as a person, but on her slot though. <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7154467#p7154467\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7154467#p7154467\" data-post-id=\"7154467\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 585</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=15481\">Quilford</a> wrote:</cite><ul><li><span style=\"padding-left:0.1in\"></span><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Votecount 2.9</div></div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">&gt;&gt;&gt; <div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF00\">pistachi0n</div> (4)&#8212; Thor665, <div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF00\">Ranmaru</div>, xCoco, Boonskiies &lt;&lt;&lt;</div><br>\nxCoco (1)&#8212; <div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF00\">pistachi0n</div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Not Voting</div> (2)&#8212; Jazzmyn, <div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF00\">VeeGee</div><br>\n<br>\nAt 4 votes, a lynch has been achieved.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Deadline</div><br>\n<br>\nA lynch has been secured before deadline.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Mod notes</div><br>\n<br>\nFlip incoming...</li></ul></div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nOn the wagon, is Thor, Coco, and Boon. Thor, to me is still null, voting Pista without any reconsideration, yet I find it in character of Thor, who even has voted myself on a D3 of another game, without any reason (when I had read him as town I think), and he was town, and so was I. Coco, is on the wagon this time, yet took really long to get on, and needed direction. Yet the next day, Coco blames me (again) by saying that I was just trying to 'get her to vote Pista'. What she doesn't realize here, is that it was a lynch between Coco or Pista. I was only trying to get a lynch, since others were not voting to avoid no lynch, yet she doesn't realize this being a newbie. Yet she tries to use this as reasoning doubt me, which is very suspicious. Boon, hammered Pista when pushing for Coco/Jazz. Due to this, I'd look into Boon if it were not Coco and Jazz. Yet, I see this as very wifomy action if the team was Coco/Boon. This is why I feel it's better to lynch Coco today, to get one scum, and be able to have a chance at finding the other after.<br>\n<br>\nNext, I want to mention Jazz is off the wagon here. Remember that she has been acting pretty wishy washy here, while not coming to a solid conclusion at all. I also want to mention, that each night kill has narrowed it down to a way that puts doubt on Jazz and Coco. Coco being a newbie, I would not expect for her to kill in this way, this could only be possible if she was paired with a person who was experienced. The kills also shed more doubt on the people on the wagon, because the pool is larger on the wagon rather than off the wagon.<br>\n<br>\nJazz has also scumread Coco, yet unvote her and never concluded her read on COco, looking at Boon and Pista ahead of her. Jazz had also been playing the waiting game, and had been wishy washy when it came to Coco. She has dropped the Catboi 'slip' altogether.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7145661#p7145661\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7145661#p7145661\" data-post-id=\"7145661\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 467</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9975\">Jazzmyn</a> wrote:</cite>Upon rereading and further meta-diving, I think I want to vote for either pistachion or Thor.<br>\n<br>\n*time passes*<br>\n<br>\n*thinks about it some more*<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Unvote</div><br>\n<br>\n*still don't know which way to go, I will have to sleep on it*<br>\n<br>\nRegards,<br>\nJazz</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nJazz is wishy washy here.

I have played with him at least 3 times, 2 time she was town and 1 time he was mafia, and we lynched him when he was mafia (thanks to MoI).

Coco, is on the wagon this time, yet took really long to get on, and needed direction. Yet the next day, Coco blames me (again) by saying that I was just trying to 'get her to vote Pista'. What she doesn't realize here, is that it was a lynch between Coco or Pista. I was only trying to get a lynch, since others were not voting to avoid no lynch, yet she doesn't realize this being a newbie. Yet she tries to use this as reasoning doubt me, which is very suspicious. Boon, hammered Pista when pushing for Coco/Jazz. Due to this, I'd look into Boon if it were not Coco and Jazz. Yet, I see this as very wifomy action if the team was Coco/Boon.

Coco being a newbie, I would not expect for her to kill in this way, this could only be possible if she was paired with a person who was experienced.

He has the weird hammer, and Jazz has the silent drop of Coco, pushing Boon and Pista ahead of her. <br>\n<br>\nI have shown why Coco is scum from her individual actions, and through VCA. She is the last piece of the puzzle, and she should be lynched ToDay.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nIt sounds more like to me that just want everyone to lynch me and go onto the next night (which will not happen because I am VT).  Why are you getting hasty Ran?  We have a lot of time? You have been saying that I am saying scum but also soft defended me before?

I trusted you before Pista flipped town (same with Boon)?

And the point of town is to lynch scum. What is your point? Let me clarify. You did not say it was my fault, but your post implied it was. That was the suspicious part. Knowing that I had no part in you coming to the read of Pista, you still said \"Would be ridiculous if ran was scum 'leading me on to pista'\" (this is a paraphrase)<br>\n<br>\nPoint taken.

You also knew that I was busy with Spaltoon stuff. I waited because I wanted to see if anyone said or pointed anything out that  I was unaware of &#8211; or brought something new to the table. I really do not understand the purpose of rushing down to put a vote.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nLet me re-state. You were the only person to not be voting *at all*. Voting is not 'rushing'. Voting pre-maturely without any evidence can possibly be rushing, yet you already had two scumreads, yet you did nothing with them. You chose to sit on your butt for the whole day and let others talk, when you yourself would be one who is active as town. Town is not afraid to throw a vote out, as it helps them get reactions and reads. Yes, you were playing splatoon with me just recently but you only responded to this post immediately. You are being selective with how you post. You respond more on defense, rather then being pro-active.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Frame? Purposely wait?  I already said I wasn&#8217;t sure if it counted for anything and it was MY point of view.  Stop jumping to conclusions.  I didn&#8217;t go &#8220;Ran told me to vote for Pista&#8221; or &#8220;Ran is scum because he told me to vote for Pista and she flipped town&#8221; Also why did you quote Pista&#8217;s VOTE on me.  To me it looks like &#8216;hey vote this person because they voted for you&#8217; if you wanted me to consider Pista either scum hunting or surviving you would have quoted something ELSE.  The other wagon was me and of course I do not want to get lynched.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nYou saying 'I'm not sure' is also wishy washy. It shows you are being intentionally vague while implying that I was trying to do that. Why point that out if you are unsure? Why not vote me? You are only point it out to seed doubt, without having to do that much work, in hopes others may agree and you can jump on later. Pista's vote on you seemed very survivelistic, plus there was nothing else I could show that was recent, because *she wasn't posting*. On 'jumping to conclusions', I am pretty sure I have considered all the angles here, and did plenty of work to come to this conclusion. I'm not being hasty at all here.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Squints. You ask me to share my reads? And then use them against me?

I changed  my mind on Vee  and voted Pista over him last day.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nMy purpose to ask for your reads is not to use them against you, it is to read you from what you want to do with the game. Again, you did a 180* on people YOU found probably townie. THAT'S NOT OK. Also, my new scum read on you was my follow up to this post. There is no need for a 'thank you for your reads', but you can imagine that I did say that.

You saying \"Oh you are right I was being too paranoid\" does not justify your actions there.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Yes of course.  I town read you early &#8211; but that might change later.  You might slip up or do something scummy.  I am not a power role &#8211; so I can only analyze what you say.  Why do you want me to stick  to my town read on you?  Do you not like me doubting you? It&#8217;s a game of mafia &#8211; of course I am going to doubt you.  And of course &#8211; is I (was) misreading Pista she would defend herself &#8211; if she does not do anything to try and change my mind etc that is when I would vote her.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nThat's not what I'm saying. Any read 'may change later', just leaving that there makes it obvious you have intention to change it, without it being changed naturally.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Because I wanted to hear what everyone said? = /<br>\nPlus I took a break and I was busy with Splatoon.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nWhy do you need to hear everyone's thoughts before voting? You haven't voted all game. That's not pro-town. Taking a break is fine, we all have our lives, but it does not justify being voteless all game.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Because I am WAITING for people share their thoughts &#8211; I know I am not confident in my reads so I am NOT going to rush and vote in something I am NOT confident in.

Yes I know I did play like this &#8211; but I am not now. </div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nThere was no hurry. There is no need for thoughts for you to do your own thing, you need to be a little bit more independent in your scumhunting.

That was after. Also, consider that no scum would actually try to really say that a post from the previous page was after a post from the page after.

I know you were busy with splatoon, but you still prioritized replying and talking over one little vote. Voting isn't hard. I also have ADHD so know that it isn't a good excuse.

You unilaterally made a call for a Popcorn massclaim without any reasoning whatsoever.  I responded that I think other methods would be more beneficial to town and that others should not follow you willy nilly just because you say so.   I suggested other methods of massclaim, and you have ignored that entirely - while not addressing any of my posts in any meaningful fashion whatsoever.   Reading your ISO, your entire posting history in this game is riddled with weak, fluffy, non-committal stuff dressed up to pretend to have substance, but upon review it has no substance at all.   You have voted for townies repeatedly, ignored substantive posts entirely,  ignored scummy behaviour by Ran and Boon entirely, and misrepresented townies repeatedly.    In short, your body of work is comprised of scummy posts trying very hard to look like they have substance but, upon scrutiny, they are appear terribly superficial and fakedy fake.  You don't actually say anything meaningful; you don't actually address what has been said; you seem to think that sidestepping the actual discussion and making vague and meaningless accusations against others or asking pointless \"questions\" of others is sufficient to skate through the game.  It isn't.   It's empty.  It's meaningless.  It's scummy.  <br>\n<br>\nYou have voted to lynch town players at every opportunity (Drak/Pistachion/Bacde).  You called Boon town, which is utterly laughable.  You seem to be studiously avoiding addressing the actual discussion at hand, while pretending to be engaged when, in fact, it appears that you are actually trying to <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">distract</div> from scum hunting, hoping to get others sidetracked, and trying to avoid being caught out (and trying to avoid having your scum partner caught out).    <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">@Town</div><br>\nDespite the fact that we are in lylo, this game is winnable.

Reading your ISO, your entire posting history in this game is riddled with weak, fluffy, non-committal stuff dressed up to pretend to have substance, but upon review it has no substance at all.   You have voted for townies repeatedly, ignored substantive posts entirely,  ignored scummy behaviour by Ran and Boon entirely, and misrepresented townies repeatedly.

You seem to be studiously avoiding addressing the actual discussion at hand, while pretending to be engaged when, in fact, it appears that you are actually trying to <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">distract</div> from scum hunting, hoping to get others sidetracked, and trying to avoid being caught out (and trying to avoid having your scum partner caught out).    <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">@Town</div><br>\nDespite the fact that we are in lylo, this game is winnable.

Pista was her <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">own</div> scumread. That she came to on her own conclusion. She once tried to say I was trying to pit her and Pista against each other, when I never lead her to Pista, she did it looking at catboi's posts. (She retracted later) Then she took forever to vote, her <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">own</div> scumread. More of my problem is her using that against me when she took that long to vote her own scumread, not her agreeing to vote due to me telling her to get on with that post.

I especially wanted input on these questions from the two of the four of you who are town but it has been like pulling teeth.

Reading comprehension is something I struggle with (just reading in general esp reading other players).  I didn't know if I should or should not because Jazz suggested that I don't and I don't think listening to her was a great idea, which winded in me taking to long because I wanted to see if others would agree or disagree. (I don't remember if they did; I need to double check) I should have just gone with the majority - I also have never done this popcorn or mass-claim before so I made a bunch of errors on my part.  I think I also made the mistake of claiming too fast and Jazz called me out on it so I became hesitant.<br>\n<br>\nAlso bring on the anemia puns.<br>\n<br>\nIf Thor is town (I'm trusting Boon and Thor...) then scum could be Jazz/Ran.  If Jazz doesn't pop in to defend herself she might need to get lynched because I think she's the only viable candidate for today.", "time": "Mon Aug 31, 2015 12:12 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=62826&start=700", "forum": "53", "thread": "62826"}

She went to visit friends of hers in the U.S. for a few days (we are Canadian and live in southern Ontario, and she often visits her close friends in the U.S., including these particular friends who are also Canadian but moved to Michigan a couple of years ago) but while there she suffered a massive seizure of some kind out of the blue as she has no medical history of such, so she was taken by ambulance to a hospital in Grand Rapids, Michigan.  Upon learning of this, it meant me embarking on a 6 hour drive to the hospital out of country, and subsequent follow up and dealing with the hospital and doctors etc., trying to arrange to get her transferred to Ontario once she was stable, which took several days.   She is back in Ontario now, and stable thankfully, but there is a whole lot still going on as she is undergoing a battery of tests and procedures to try to sort out what happened and why she would suddenly have a massive seizure like that out of the blue.   She is supposed to start back to school next week (in her final year of university) but we now have a bunch of medical procedures and tests (CT, brain MRI, and a whole host of others) scheduled and it is not clear whether or not she will be able to start back to school next week at all, but here's hoping.  <br>\n<br>\nIn the circumstances, I have been unable to participate in any of my 3 ongoing games and, given the uncertainty of the immediate future and given that my daughter's health and wellbeing are the most important things on the planet to me, and given that I am freaked out and sort of overwhelmed as a result of all of this, and given that I have slept very little for the past several days, I think it is probably best if take a break for the foreseeable future and replace out of all of my games at present.<br>\n<br>\nI am very sorry for any inconvenience that this may have caused.  <br>\n<br>\nAs an aside with respect to this game specifically (although I have not been able to read the game or any game for that matter since last week), the fact is that I am 100% town and Boon is 100% lying when he claims otherwise (if he is still claiming otherwise).  Townies:  please remember that this is Lylo; the two scum can't lynch me without help from a Townie and both of the scum do not want to be seen as trying to lynch me when they know that they need at least one Townie to help them.
