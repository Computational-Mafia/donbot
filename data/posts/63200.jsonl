DO NOT quote any PMs. Which includes PMs between yourself &amp; the mod, backup mod, role PM's ect. Paraphrasing is allowed. If you have any doubts PM your mod.<br>\n5. DO NOT use cryptography, invisible text, tiny text or anything that attempts to bypass or circle around this rule.<br>\n6. Do NOT attempt to impersonate or pretend to be the mod. I will make &amp; edit posts using this <div style=\"display:inline;color:#0080BF\">color </div>. Color <div style=\"display:inline;color:#0080BF\">#0080BF</div> which can be found in Row 1, slot 14. Do not use font colors which may be deemed annoying to both the players or the mod.<br>\n7. DO NOT talk about this game outside of the game or PT thread provided by the mod for any reason.<br>\n8. DO NOT make bets, promises of awards or use any outside influences of the sorts in this game.<br>\n9. Attempting to pretend to break any rules will be treated as if the rule was broken which may result in a mod-kill.<br>\n10. DO NOT make any derogatory comments based on race, sexual orientation ect. It WILL NOT be tolerated &amp; will result in a force replacement ALWAYS. Personal attacks will NOT be tolerated. Everyone is here to win, but keep things civil.<br>\n11. Breaking of a rule may result in a mod-kill at the mod's discretion. If you are mod-killed you will become a neutral survIvor &amp; will automatically lose. A mod kill may or may not end the day, at the mod's discretion.<br>\n12. The mod reserves the right to change or amend the rules. Any rule changes will be posted here as well as in the thread.<br>\n13. If you die in the game, no \"bah\" posts. Period.<br>\n14. The mod's word is final on all matters. DO NOT argue with the mod about a decision made. Any inflammatory comments towards the mod may result in a mod-kill at the mod'a discretion. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Voting Rules </div></div><br>\n<br>\n1. Votes must be made either by using \"VOTE\" being bolded or using the vote tags. Abbreviations, missing punctuation, &amp; misspellings will be accepted as long as the mod can tell who the intended vote was for. If the vote is believed to be a vote by the mod, then it will be counted as such.<br>\n2. To unvote a player must use \"UNVOTE\" being bolded or the unvote tags. Any other ways of unvoting will not be counted.<br>\n3. You may vote \"No Lynch\" which requires the same amount of votes as a lynch would require to pass.<br>\n4. Once a majority vote is reached, the player is lynched &amp; the game will be in twilight until the Mod locks the thread. The players including the player lynched will be able to continue to discuss the game until the mod locks the thread. At this time DO NOT disclose any role's ect or anything else that will ruin the current game.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Activity Rules </div></div><br>\n<br>\n1.

If a player has received three prods throughout the game, they will be replaced at the mod's discretion. If a player has declared V/LA they may be exempt from prods at the mod's discretion.<br>\n2.

It could have just as easily been selected (and in my opinion most likely was selected) due to it being an interesting game as it could have been selected for being a game in which Accountant played poorly. If she just brought it up out of the blue, I could understand this response since there would be little other motive for its mention, but it was an answer to one of Performer's questions.", "time": "Fri Sep 04, 2015 10:36 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=63200&start=175", "forum": "53", "thread": "63200"}

It's understandable that Performer might not have realized that Slandaar's post was a joke, and voted accordingly. Noticing if something is a joke or not is not alignment indicative in my opinion. If anything, his reaction shows pro-Town sentiment, since he showed a negative reaction to someone trying to assert themselves as confirmed Town, and a newer player will have more transparent motives. However, Performer does seem reasonably competent from his other posts, so I would say that WIFOM applies here and it is a null-tell.<br>\n<br>\nI suspect you now to some extent, for what I perceive as an attempt to place suspicion on a player undeservedly. This is similar to what Mario has done, but less scummy because your vote had more valid reasoning.

Part of it is just personality and part of it I actually have my reasons for. The reactions to my aggressiveness can help me further read the person doing it. Like, you and Accountant backed off so I'm noting it and seeing if it is because you are town who realized you were wrong about me or scum backing off because you don't want to deal with my push back. I'll just have to watch you for now and see how Accountant's replacement behaves. I am scumreading Expedience and I don't think you'd sheep vote him if you were scum together with him so that's something to consider but only if Expedience is scum. And FWIW, I am really trying hard to tone down my anger/defensiveness from what it has been in other games.

I mean, why say you don't want to vote and then do it right away because a couple people didn't like that you didn't vote? Appeasement is very scummy. Town doesn't appease. Town doesn't give a shit what they look like for the most part. Scum do.<br>\n<br>\nAlso, I've noticed that grayfoxxxx, All Alone, and Performer all have about 6 or 7 posts and none of them say much of anything. It would not surprise me at all, if there were scum in this group. Making yourself unreadable is also scummy.</div></blockquote><br>\nHold on here. I have to disagree on appeasement being scummy.

Regardless of what your high-tech professional theory book tells you about it being an automatic scumtell or whatever, that's what everyone's implying here. I FoS'ed him in the first place, so why would I be afraid of voting for him? Voting is basically a formality which I generally prefer to use to lynch another player rather than being representative of my suspicions. This is because I believe it can lead to bias in the reads of other players (e.g. they read a player differently if they see that there's already a wagon on them). While giving an opinion alone has a similar effect, it is to a lesser degree because of the black-and-white symbolism of a vote (it's either on someone or off them).<br>\n<br>\nI'm reading Accountant as town.

There is just no way in hell scum would start D2 off with a fakeclaim of vig and to claim being blocked and then to to go after grayfoxxxx of all people. I think the early claim and the eagerness in it, thinking he could get us a scum, was very townie. He's pretty much confirmed town in my eyes. This is good because I didn't have his alignment sorted D1 so it's nice to have that settled now.<br>\n<br>\nRegarding why he was blocked, I refuse to believe a town doctor would protect grayfoxxxx. Mafia doctor is rarely seen in Large Normals but I've never seen it in a mini. That doesn't mean it isn't possible, it just doesn't seem likely. A Mafia roleblocker is possible if Davsto left any crumbs about his role, otherwise I'm not so sure that's very likely either. A town jailkeeper on grayfoxxxx is another possibility due to the fact that he was scumread by so many. Then again, CDB suggested he be vigged so I don't know if that was a great play either. grayfoxxxx could be lying about being a VT and actually be BP mafia or something but there's no way to really prove that based on what happened with Davsto's shot. Anyway, at this point, I don't think we are going to be able to get grayfoxxxx's alignment and I'd rather not spend any more time speculating roles or setup as it isn't really helpful for town at this point.", "time": "Fri Sep 11, 2015 11:28 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=63200&start=400", "forum": "53", "thread": "63200"}

He's been off my radar this whole game, and looking at his ISO he comes off like his primary goal is staying off everyone's radar. Of particular note is the fact that his vote for Wanderer is literally his first nonrandom vote this whole game, in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7221233#p7221233\">496</a>.

Silverwolf clearly suspects those people anyway, so it's not a case of lynching them \"just because they claimed VT\". It's that you have suspicious people who, if it turns out are town after all, don't cost us a power role by lynching. If you assume that town always tell the truth about their role (which they should), then lynching a VT claim is inherently safer than lynching a power-role claim. That's not to say that claiming VT is a surefire way to get lynched - you judge people on their play, and I think Silverwolf is doing that - but there's something to be said for, if there are a few claims out, lynching someone who's already claimed and carries less penalty if you're wrong than looking elsewhere for its own sake and risking outing even more information.", "time": "Tue Sep 15, 2015 5:26 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=63200&start=500", "forum": "53", "thread": "63200"}

I know i'm town so either you are lying or All alone/Wanderer is scum with Mario. If the former then well played, I don't see myself getting out of this miss lynch.<br>\n<br>\nWanderer might be confirmed town regardless of SW's alignment. If SW is scum, she would have to get a fake guilty on her scum partner or we would lynch her the next day for lying (therefore Mario is scum). If she is town then she has an innocent read on Wanderer and a guilty on Mario.<br>\n<br>\nThere could also be a mafia godfather. I'm not sure on that but it would make sense considering how many PRs we have in town. If this is the case then Wanderer is not confirmed town.<br>\n<br>\nNow for the motivation for SW-scum to pull off this gambit. It has become apparent that Octopus was targeted by scum at night. This would only make sense coming from Mario or Wanderer considering he had them two as his biggest scum reads. Considering Wanderer was the first to vote Performer on the day he got lynched (amongst other reasons pointing to her being town) and the associative tells between Mario and Performer, I don't think SW-scum would have the confidence to push Wanderer as scum over Mario. SW wouldn't just keep quiet about this either, her chances of getting lynched after Mario was quite high. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">*The way she jumped on the Performer wagon and then quickly came back off it after I pointed out her inconsistencies with that play is actually quite scummy.</div> Also, she hammered Performer really quickly after the intent.

SW being alive tomorrow is a null tell but it might clear some players. I'm going to think about that some more but the most obvious person that wouldn't mind her being alive is the Godfather. If there is a godfather, all the town innocent reads from town-SW mean nothing. Anyway, after this, SW scum will call an innocent on me/All alone and lynch the other. She would then kill someone at night leaving her at 1 v 2. <br>\n<br>\nThis play is actually way better then just sitting quietly today and hoping she doesn't get lynched tomorrow. Claiming cop tomorrow isn't nearly as good as doing it today. Seeing as Mario was the most likely lynch candidate today, she wouldn't have gotten the town credit if she claimed cop tomorrow (due to her not being able to call a guilty on Mario).<br>\n--<br>\n<br>\nLynch Mario today for sure, he is pretty much confirmed scum.

VT is just what someone claims. It doesn't confirm them as town. What confirms someone is town is the mod saying so, the flip, or a cop inno-although in the case of an GF, that wouldn't even matter. I don't believe you are a GF based on voting patterns and behavior this game, I feel safe with having you as town. Grayfoxxxx too for reasons I've stated.

Like, In what Universe does this even make sense as scum play? Then he talks about my scummy play which I already explained was because CDB's hard townread on me was making me nervous about being the NK. Then he says me claiming cop today makes sense instead of tomorrow-hell, I would of claimed it yesterday if given a chance. absta is setting up a 1v1 with me where All Alone calmly explained why absta and mario make sense as a team from a NK analysis standpoint.

Like, In what Universe does this even make sense as scum play? Then he talks about my scummy play which I already explained was because CDB's hard townread on me was making me nervous about being the NK. Then he says me claiming cop today makes sense instead of tomorrow-hell, I would of claimed it yesterday if given a chance. absta is setting up a 1v1 with me where All Alone calmly explained why absta and mario make sense as a team from a NK analysis standpoint. She was also the second vote on the Performer wagon which is more likely to be town than scum from what I've seen in games.

I don't think I ever would of suspected him if I didn't have that guilty on Mario and town clear on Wanderer. Because then I was able to look at voting patterns/NK's and see that grayfoxxxx and All alone were unlikely scum.<br>\n<br>\nAs far as being too many PR's for town, I can see that being a complaint if the game was won by PR's set up breaking or something, but here it was just unlucky the way it wall played out. I mean the vig kill didn't go through on grayfoxxxx, octupus was jailed-bad NK choice BTW, and Wanderer-who is a tough mislynch-was town cleared as well. Plus, Davsto who probably would of been mislynched, was a PR and super town by the way he outed. Then, I didn't really have to out my result or myself to save him.<br>\n<br>\nIt's not fun being caught by a PR as scum, but tons of fun catching scum as a PR. This makes up for my first newbie where I was town tracker and had a guilty and was shot before I could out it. Major bummer that was.<br>\n<br>\npedit: Yeah, there's some different ways the Davsto claim could of been handled by scum. I'm pretty sure, even if I didn't have that town result on him, just like CDB who I was already townreading, I would of townread him off the way he claimed.<br>\n<br>\nTown PR's are eager beavers when they think they can catch scum and don't hold back at all. That's a pretty strong towntell in my experience so far.", "time": "Sat Sep 26, 2015 4:08 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=63200&start=775", "forum": "53", "thread": "63200"}
