DO NOT quote any PMs. Which includes PMs between yourself &amp; the mod, backup mod, role PM's ect. Paraphrasing is allowed. If you have any doubts PM your mod.<br>5. DO NOT use cryptography, invisible text, tiny text or anything that attempts to bypass or circle around this rule.<br>6. Do NOT attempt to impersonate or pretend to be the mod. I will make &amp; edit posts using this <span style=\"color: #0080BF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">color </span></span>. Color <span style=\"color: #0080BF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">#0080BF</span></span> which can be found in Row 1, slot 14. Do not use font colors which may be deemed annoying to both the players or the mod.<br>7. DO NOT talk about this game outside of the game or PT thread provided by the mod for any reason.<br>8. DO NOT make bets, promises of awards or use any outside influences of the sorts in this game.<br>9. Attempting to pretend to break any rules will be treated as if the rule was broken which may result in a mod-kill.<br>10. DO NOT make any derogatory comments based on race, sexual orientation ect. It WILL NOT be tolerated &amp; will result in a force replacement ALWAYS. Personal attacks will NOT be tolerated. Everyone is here to win, but keep things civil.<br>11. Breaking of a rule may result in a mod-kill at the mod's discretion. If you are mod-killed you will become a neutral survIvor &amp; will automatically lose. A mod kill may or may not end the day, at the mod's discretion.<br>12. The mod reserves the right to change or amend the rules. Any rule changes will be posted here as well as in the thread.<br>13. If you die in the game, no \"bah\" posts. Period.<br>14. The mod's word is final on all matters. DO NOT argue with the mod about a decision made. Any inflammatory comments towards the mod may result in a mod-kill at the mod'a discretion. <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Voting Rules </span></span><br><br>1. Votes must be made either by using \"VOTE\" being bolded or using the vote tags. Abbreviations, missing punctuation, &amp; misspellings will be accepted as long as the mod can tell who the intended vote was for. If the vote is believed to be a vote by the mod, then it will be counted as such.<br>2. To unvote a player must use \"UNVOTE\" being bolded or the unvote tags. Any other ways of unvoting will not be counted.<br>3. You may vote \"No Lynch\" which requires the same amount of votes as a lynch would require to pass.<br>4. Once a majority vote is reached, the player is lynched &amp; the game will be in twilight until the Mod locks the thread. The players including the player lynched will be able to continue to discuss the game until the mod locks the thread. At this time DO NOT disclose any role's ect or anything else that will ruin the current game.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Activity Rules </span></span><br><br>1. Players who have not posted in the game for 48 hours will receive a \"prod\". A player who has not responded to a prod within 24 hours will be replaced. If a player has received three prods throughout the game, they will be replaced at the mod's discretion. If a player has declared V/LA they may be exempt from prods at the mod's discretion.<br>2. In the occurrence that a replacement is necessary, the deadline may be extended at the mod's discretion.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Deadlines </span></span><br><br>1. Days will have a deadline of fourteen (14) real life days<br>2. Nights will have a deadline of two (2) real life days<br>3.

It's understandable that Performer might not have realized that Slandaar's post was a joke, and voted accordingly. Noticing if something is a joke or not is not alignment indicative in my opinion. If anything, his reaction shows pro-Town sentiment, since he showed a negative reaction to someone trying to assert themselves as confirmed Town, and a newer player will have more transparent motives. However, Performer does seem reasonably competent from his other posts, so I would say that WIFOM applies here and it is a null-tell.<br><br>I suspect you now to some extent, for what I perceive as an attempt to place suspicion on a player undeservedly. This is similar to what Mario has done, but less scummy because your vote had more valid reasoning. You also might not have realized that Performer was a newer player."}

Although I didn't like his original reasoning for voting Accountant, this kind of play reminds me more of town Mario than scum Mario from the experience I have with him so far.

The newb card argument isn't really the basis for my Accountant scumread at the moment.<br>2. I have done the same thing before (see: Newbie 1629) except with a scumread instead of self-defence.

Part of it is just personality and part of it I actually have my reasons for. The reactions to my aggressiveness can help me further read the person doing it. Like, you and Accountant backed off so I'm noting it and seeing if it is because you are town who realized you were wrong about me or scum backing off because you don't want to deal with my push back. I'll just have to watch you for now and see how Accountant's replacement behaves. I am scumreading Expedience and I don't think you'd sheep vote him if you were scum together with him so that's something to consider but only if Expedience is scum. And FWIW, I am really trying hard to tone down my anger/defensiveness from what it has been in other games. It's not really alignment indicative for me but I do realize it's been over the top in the past so I am working on it. There's no reason for me to make the game miserable for anyone."}

Townies will <span style=\"font-style: italic\">generally</span> defend themselves by simply explaining what their true intentions were. It's the natural reaction most people have to being wrongly accused, and it's usually the best defense against a wrong accusation as well. Expedience's defensiveness, on the other hand, looks like they're going way out of their way to cast whatever they're doing in the absolute best possible light. For instance:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7198912#p7198912\" class=\"postlink\">post 177</a>, Expedience wrote:</cite>By decrying invalid arguments, I prevent poor and irrelevant discussion and allow good discussion to sprout in its place.

Generally when townies call something a null tell, it's because that's their opinion and they wanted to share that opinion, simple as that, and an explanation from that player would reflect that simplicity. Expedience's explanation is because they're some kind of Grand Master Architect of Logic and Reason or something. I seriously doubt Expedience started out this game calling everything null with the intention of ensuring good analysis and discussion. I think they decided after the fact to come up with a town motive for their actions, and having to come up with a town motive after the fact implies that they didn't have a town motive in the first place. Ergo, Expedience is scum."}

Someone asks me to claim, fine, I claim VT, knowing that anything incriminating on me is not accurate. By that point, Davsto had already explicitly claimed a vig shot on you, while Mario is the only one who's ever mentioned a rolecop. Even if a rolecop is involved, you still don't have anything much to which to react; you're a VT, this is all basic, any inaccuracies are on their end. I don't know why you would need to delay reacting to something (your words) when the relevant claims are already out.<br><br>If I were mafia in your position, though, it wouldn't be that cut-and-dried. By knowing what powers the mafia group has, I might know more about what could be going wrong here than I would if I were a VT - maybe the mafia has a rolecop and you're confused that the word has entered the thread before that rolecop has flipped. Maybe you're worrying that your claim is no longer going to stand up to scrutiny. Whatever it is, you know that it'll be easier to say something that fits together to avoid incriminating you once all the information is out; that's a concern that a real VT doesn't share.<br><br>I'm not saying that that's definitely what happened, but that post of yours implies to me that there's a thought process going on beyond 'I'm a VT, who else fucked this up' so I find it suspicious."}

At least in the negative context you placed it?</div></blockquote><br><br>If I'm town in your position, my reaction isn't complicated. Someone asks me to claim, fine, I claim VT, knowing that anything incriminating on me is not accurate. By that point, Davsto had already explicitly claimed a vig shot on you, while Mario is the only one who's ever mentioned a rolecop. Even if a rolecop is involved, you still don't have anything much to which to react; you're a VT, this is all basic, any inaccuracies are on their end. I don't know why you would need to delay reacting to something (your words) when the relevant claims are already out.<br><br>If I were mafia in your position, though, it wouldn't be that cut-and-dried. By knowing what powers the mafia group has, I might know more about what could be going wrong here than I would if I were a VT - maybe the mafia has a rolecop and you're confused that the word has entered the thread before that rolecop has flipped. Maybe you're worrying that your claim is no longer going to stand up to scrutiny. Whatever it is, you know that it'll be easier to say something that fits together to avoid incriminating you once all the information is out; that's a concern that a real VT doesn't share.<br><br>I'm not saying that that's definitely what happened, but that post of yours implies to me that there's a thought process going on beyond 'I'm a VT, who else fucked this up' so I find it suspicious.</div></blockquote><br><br>I've said I was confused by the role cop thing from mario. It's been explained, and I gave my read on the situation. <br>No grand implications that you keep mentioning."}

First, Davsto is town. There is just no way in hell scum would start D2 off with a fakeclaim of vig and to claim being blocked and then to to go after grayfoxxxx of all people. I think the early claim and the eagerness in it, thinking he could get us a scum, was very townie. He's pretty much confirmed town in my eyes. This is good because I didn't have his alignment sorted D1 so it's nice to have that settled now.<br><br>Regarding why he was blocked, I refuse to believe a town doctor would protect grayfoxxxx. Mafia doctor is rarely seen in Large Normals but I've never seen it in a mini. That doesn't mean it isn't possible, it just doesn't seem likely. A Mafia roleblocker is possible if Davsto left any crumbs about his role, otherwise I'm not so sure that's very likely either. A town jailkeeper on grayfoxxxx is another possibility due to the fact that he was scumread by so many. Then again, CDB suggested he be vigged so I don't know if that was a great play either. grayfoxxxx could be lying about being a VT and actually be BP mafia or something but there's no way to really prove that based on what happened with Davsto's shot. Anyway, at this point, I don't think we are going to be able to get grayfoxxxx's alignment and I'd rather not spend any more time speculating roles or setup as it isn't really helpful for town at this point."}

What are you talking about, not showing signs of frustration? I'm as bothered by scummy behavior like Grayfoxxxx's inconsistency, as much as any warmhearted townie can be!

I didn't go into Expedience enough, I admit, because a certain someone hammered him on page 13 before I could get more in - the guy with the disturbing avatar, what's his name...Davsto! Expedience being town did cross my mind , as his appeasement move didn't strike me as scummy. But again, I didn't exactly expect someone to hammer so quickly, someone I suddenly started leaning stronger in the scum department. Then Davsto claims 1-shot Vig in day 2, and subsequent posts make him seem more town than in day 1."}

That's really the best way I can describe it. She's there but not feeling town at all or even all that interested in the game.

It's that you have suspicious people who, if it turns out are town after all, don't cost us a power role by lynching. If you assume that town always tell the truth about their role (which they should), then lynching a VT claim is inherently safer than lynching a power-role claim. That's not to say that claiming VT is a surefire way to get lynched - you judge people on their play, and I think Silverwolf is doing that - but there's something to be said for, if there are a few claims out, lynching someone who's already claimed and carries less penalty if you're wrong than looking elsewhere for its own sake and risking outing even more information."}

My earlier scumread on her was based on slaandar kill which is WIFOM by itself, her inconsistencies which she's addressed, her flat tone and lack of enthusiasm which is less now that she seems to be fighting again, and kind of a gut read based on not liking my interactions with her.

Performer's ISO reads of safe play, lack of scumhunting, and really being UTR. Just look at his latest post. He doesn't really engage the game or others much and is just kind of there. I don't like the idea of another claim if he's town but I feel he's more likely to be scum than Wanderer right now plus there is enough discussion about this from others that I agree with, so I'm fine with taking the chance of another claim getting out in this case as he is likely to be scum.<br><br>Grayfoxxxx is doing nothing to help town.

Incidently it's my opinion that if performer does flip scum then it's highly probable that Mario is scum as many of his early posts were about linking a team together based on patterns of voting for Performer.<br><br>Davsto.

Greyfoxx can not have known what was driving Davsto's charge on him, this makes his VT claim beliveable, especialy when he tries to back it up by being more anti-town than any scum could ever be. I'm not buying that he is scum, as scum play would has been to put out a valuable PR to counterclaim a own Cop in the hope of at least forcing a mislynch. but, I agree with Silverwolf, he does need to go before LYLO.<br><br>For now I'm going with my first choice<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Wanderer</span>"}

It's really unlikely that Grayfox is scum and hasn't shot a single townie who's suspected him. Especially with the Octopus kill coming after a \"if Performer flips scum then Mario is scum\" post, which suggests scum are willing to kill townies who suspect them.

I don't believe you are a GF based on voting patterns and behavior this game, I feel safe with having you as town. Grayfoxxxx too for reasons I've stated.

Like, In what Universe does this even make sense as scum play? Then he talks about my scummy play which I already explained was because CDB's hard townread on me was making me nervous about being the NK. Then he says me claiming cop today makes sense instead of tomorrow-hell, I would of claimed it yesterday if given a chance. absta is setting up a 1v1 with me where All Alone calmly explained why absta and mario make sense as a team from a NK analysis standpoint. She was also the second vote on the Performer wagon which is more likely to be town than scum from what I've seen in games.
