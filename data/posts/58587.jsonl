Be competitive. Don't be lame. Don't flake out on us.<br>(2) Do not take screenshots or directly quote any of the PMs that I send you. Doing so will result in a mod-kill. Pretending to break this rule is the same as actually breaking it. You may paraphrase, but use caution. When in doubt, run it by me first.<br>(3) Do not edit any of your posts, if you have the ability to do so.<br>(4) Do not use encrypted text, hidden text, small text, or any other hard-to-read text when posting.<br>(5) Once you have been lynched or killed, you are out of the game. Do not post anymore until the game is over. That means no \"Bah!\" posts, please.<br>(6) Do not talk about this game with anybody else outside of this thread unless your role PM explicitly says that you can.<br>(7) Heated discussion is fine, but personal attacks, insults, flaming, and poor sportsmanship are not. Please don't be a jerk to your fellow players. If I feel that your behavior is preventing other players from enjoying the game, I reserve the right to force-replace or mod-kill you.<br>(8) Do not talk about ongoing games. Seriously, don't.<br><br>Day, Night, and Twilight:<br>(9) Each Day phase will last for two weeks apiece and each Night phase will last for two days apiece. I will post specific deadlines in the game thread at the start of every Day and Night phase.<br>(10) Players may continue to talk during Twilight, including the player that has been lynched.<br>(11) If you do not send me your Night action before the specified deadline, I will assume that you are not performing an action on that Night. <br>(12) If you know you will be unavailable during a Night phase, you may send me your night action during the preceding Day phase if you so desire.<br>(13) Deadline extension requests will be considered on a case-by-case basis.<br><br>Voting:<br>(14) Please post all votes and unvotes using either the bold tag or the vote tag. Votes should look like this: <span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: Salamence</span> or <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Sala</span><br>(15) Unvotes are helpful, but not necessary.<br>(16) Please refrain from engaging in any kind of voting trickery. If it looks like a vote, I'm counting it as a vote.<br>(17) A lynch will only occur when a majority (more than 50% of all possible votes) is reached. The number of votes needed to hammer will be included with every vote count.<br>(18) If a majority is not reached by the deadline, there will be no lynch on that Day.<br>(19) Once a hammer occurs, no votes or unvotes will prevent the lynch from happening.<br>(20) Additional votes include VOTE: No Lynch to end the Day with no lynch (which will also require a majority) and VOTE: Draw to end the game in a draw (which will require 100% agreement from all living players).<br><br>Activity:<br>(21) You will be expected to post at least once every 48 hours. If you go more than 48 hours without posting, you will be prodded.<br>(22) If you receive a prod, you will have 24 hours to post in the game thread. If you do not respond to your prod within 24 hours, you will be replaced. Additionally, if I have to prod you more than three times, you will be replaced.<br>(23) If you know that you will have limited access to the game for more than a few days, please let me know either in the thread or via PM.<br><br>Communication with the Moderator:<br>(24) I may be cooler and sexier than you, but I do still make mistakes every now and then. If you notice an error with the vote counts, deadlines, or anything else related to the game, please let me know and I will correct the issue.<br>(25) I will not answer any role-related questions in the game thread. If you have any questions about your role, the (theoretical) roles of any other players in the game, or (theoretical) role interactions, send me a PM. Do not try to trick me into confirming a player's role. I will not be amused.<br>(26) If you need to get my attention, just include <span class=\"noboldsig\">@Mod</span> or <span class=\"noboldsig\">@Salamence</span> in your post.<br><br>Miscellaneous:<br>(27) If you have any problems with another player, send me a PM and I will do my best to resolve the issue.<br>(28) If a player is mod-killed during the Day phase, then that Day will end immediately.<br>(29) <span style=\"color: #0040FF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">My color is blue (#0040FF) DON\u2019T USE IT</span></span><br>(30) The flavor text is for entertainment purposes only. Analyze it at your own risk.<br>(31) Do not ask me to mod-kill, force-replace, or discipline any other player in the game. That is my decision to make, not yours.<br>(32) As the moderator, my word is final. Please respect my instructions and my decisions.<br>(33) I reserve the right to change these rules during the game if necessary. If this happens, I will inform everybody of the rule change in the thread.<br>(34) In addition to these rules, all site-wide rules also apply.<br>(35) Claiming color code is prohibited. <br><br>Here is the VT PM, <br><blockquote><div><cite>VT PM wrote:</cite>Greetings, Salamence20, you are a <span style=\"color: #00FF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Vanilla Townie.</span></span> You can talk during the day and sleep during the night. You also have a vote that allows you to lynch anyone you want, or to not use it at all. You win when all threats to the town have been defeated. Please PM me your role to confirm</div></blockquote>"}

It may be because 99% of the mafia play has been in-person where voting didn't really happen much until it was a concrete vote, and maybe I just need to get used to it working a little differently online."}

The pressure comes at L-1 or L-2 when town is ready to lynch without a claim, and all that does is run the risk of outing power roles. Scum will trip up when you talk to them. <br><br>I'm not seeing how Joker's list is scummy because she hasn't had a significant scumread, either. There are only two conflicts that I can actually see having happened: Riabi's avatar and acryon's posting style. You're starting to get up there on my read, though.

While I was reading along in this thread, I was kind of caught up in another game, and had a difficult time actually following some of the conversations in this thread. I gave this thread a re-read just now, and made some notes. Here's where I stand:<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">acryon</span> - I was really getting a town vibe from him up until around post 130. I totally disagree with the idea that \"this direction is not the one we should be going in\" regardless of what that direction is. Everyone has different ideas about how to scumhunt, and to reject those ideas out of hand seems scummy. If someone really is town, why not answer questions directed at them? Null, but shaky.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">RC</span> and <span class=\"noboldsig\">elyse</span> both seem to be asking good questions and getting good discussion going. Lean town.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">hiplop</span> - While changing one's mind is ok, and having the ability and willingness to do so is, IMO, crucial to the town's success... this guy just doesn't seem to have any opinions at all. To me, he seems to be trying to guess which way the flow of the game/voting is going to go, hoping he can jump on a wave and ride it into the endgame. Lean scum.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Candice</span> - My read on him is similar to hiplop, but to a lesser degree. To me, it seems important to have opinions in this game. The more the better. If you're wrong, you're wrong, but, it seems to me that the more opinions town has, the more discussion, and the more info we have to base our other reads on. Lean slightly scum.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Slandaar</span> - Similar to acryon above, there is a lot of what I view as pro-town activity in his posts, with one glaring exception... If you have reads, why in the world wouldn't you share them? Null, but suspicious.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">joker443</span> - Yeah, there just seems to be something... weird there. Maybe she's just a bit odd, and has a very different way of looking at the world than me, but, I'm really not liking the lack of any scum reads at all. Lean scum, FOS.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">boonskiies</span> - He's not given me any reason at all to even consider changing my vote right now. It's not the lack of post count that bothers me, it's the complete and total lack of anything resembling opinion or discussion in them that bothers me. Strong lean scum."}

But, in my defense, rather than looking at number of substantive posts, how about we consider percentage of posts that have substance? Before this I only had 2 posts with any substance, but out of how many? 4. That's 50%. Take boonskiies, who has 6 posts, but 0 with any substance, and joker, who has 12 posts and only 1 with any substance. I think I come out ahead there.<br><br>Additionally, I find it odd that you read my list, but you had nothing to say about my read on you. My question wasn't rhetorical... Why not allow all types of scumhunting to proceed? If you are town, surely you have nothing to hide.</div></blockquote><br><br>To be honest I had written up a response, but I thought it was defensive rather than productive, but I'll address it since you asked again.  I get your read on me, but at the same time, Slandaar seems to be asking the same questions over and over while ignoring the responses of those that are answering.  Surely I can stop responding at some point?  I've already explained that I don't think Slandaar is even scumhunting, whether he or anyone else agrees or not.  And I thought I explained that pretty well earlier.  If you don't accept that, then we'll have to agree to disagree.<br><br>And as for your argument on percentage, it's a stretch to call your 3rd post really substantive.  If anything it is your 1 post vs. their 0 posts.  The problem with looking by percentage is that some players' play-styles include fluff-posts and small comments, while others do not, so it is hard to compare the two percentage-wise.  Keep in mind that I don't think any of this makes you scummy, I just don't necessarily agree with the argument."}

Null<br>Slandaar..Doesn't really say a lot most of it has no content but his last posts about acryon I do rather like..50/50</div></blockquote><br><br>Is this a joke (pun intended)?<br><br>You're telling me you have not one scumread? I see three \"50/50\" reads here, which I take the mean another way of saying null. This is just so lame. There's a complete lack of aggression or interest in pressuing anyone. The most aggressive this gets is \"gets a bad feeling\" on me. You say I'm not being majorly helpful and that the avatar thing was \"pointless\", but you didn't bring this up at the time, you just called it \"interesting\". <br><br>This reads to me like you're wetting your finger and sticking it in the air to try and gauge which way the winds are blowing. You want to wait until there's three or four people voting one person so you can join them and hide in the back, yeah?<br><br>---<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>acryon 123 wrote:</cite>I definitely see what you mean, but I just prefer my pressure to be based in the discussion and not throwing my vote back and forth. It may be because 99% of the mafia play has been in-person where voting didn't really happen much until it was a concrete vote, and maybe I just need to get used to it working a little differently online.</div></blockquote><br><br>This is better rationale that Candice used, but I understand where both of you are coming from. When I started playing here, I was big on FoSes myself. <br><br>---<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Espresso 130 wrote:</cite>Don't put words in my mouth. You may not claim my intentions, because they are mine.<br><br>My intention was to get people to discuss something. People are a lot easier to read when they aren't sitting idly making jokes and random accusations, but rather when they're arguing, talking, discussing, defending themselves, and accusing others.<br><br>I wasn't trying to get anybody lynched or start a wagon. I was trying to get the ball rolling.<br><br>And did it work?<br><br>With the way you're trying to hunt me down, I would say it did.</div></blockquote><br><br>Now <span style=\"font-style: italic\">this</span>, I like. I'm coming around on Espresso. This is town sounding because Slandaar is proportedly trying to speak for Espresso, but even if he's doing so with good intentions (as far as Espresso is concerned), Espresso is quick to chime in and tell Slandaar that he doesn't necessarily speak for him. Good post.<br><br>---<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Candice 139 wrote:</cite>RC, if you really believe that was a scumtell, please say so. I wanna vote you if you do. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\";)\" title=\"Wink\"></div></blockquote><br><br>I don't make it a habit of saying things I do not mean. If I find a logical reason for voting someone, whether it's small or large, I'm going to do it. How others interpret what I say is their business, but I was assuredly not voting kush as a joke or anything like that. Additionally, kush has not done anything to get me to really feel much better about him, but a couple of people have done things that made me feel worse about them (hiplop and joker). <br><br>---<br><br>I love, love, love Riabi's <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6076415#p6076415\">149</a>. Very clear and concise. Everything he says is explained. I'm also glad he's got an avatar now. Indeed, he may have shot to the top of my town reads with that single post. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Riabi 162 wrote:</cite>I had less of an issue with that and more of an issue with the phrase \"starting to\" and the word \"kinda\". They read to me like \"well, this is kinda what I want to say, but, I'm too afraid to just come out and say it\". That said, I can buy that it's mostly a playstyle thing, and I'll try to keep that in mind going forward.</div></blockquote><br><br>This is good as well. Maybe a touch hard of Candice (although I agree with Riabi's point, I think something has to be said for assessing the players on a case-by-case basis... while I've never played with Candice to my recollection, he strikes me as the insecure, for lack of a better word, type that may not be the one to take the first strike, but once he's found what he's looking for, he'll come after one hard), but I can forgive that as I could just be too naive and unsuspecting toward Candice.<br><br>---<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>hiplop 166 wrote:</cite>Pretty damn sure that slandaar/candice discussion means they are town.</div></blockquote><br><br>I agree with this, but I'd like to think I've documented as to how I've got there. I can't say the same for you.<br><br>Also your <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6076615#p6076615\">169</a> flat out contradicts what you said in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6076600#p6076600\">166</a> RE: Candice, which just gives me more red flags about your alignment.

I'm getting a lot of very clear town/scum reads in this game, so I'm really happy with the way things are going. <br><br>---<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Boon 195 wrote:</cite>What else should I say?</div></blockquote><br><br>Why you're voting him."}

What I meant by he's done well is that he's <span style=\"font-style: italic\">expressed</span> himself well. It's clear to me why he's gotten the reads on everyone he's gotten. He's asking questions, and he's inviting engagement. <br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6076536#p6076536\">156</a>: He engages me here after I've asked a direct question to clarify his position on me. Not only is this just good participation, it's also consistent with his implied belief that town should be answering questions asked of them (see his read on Acryon in 149).<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6076562#p6076562\">160</a>: Engaging Acryon, admits that he has a point and defends himself, and also reiterates his question for Acryon (still engaging other players).<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6078790#p6078790\">253</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6078822#p6078822\">257</a>: I'm not seeing the inconsistency here either, Kush. \"Strong lean scum\" doesn't conflict with \"if he's town he's useless\". It is allowing for the possibility that Boonskiies is town, which is actually a possibility. But I find it kind of disingenuous to say that Riabi is going for a lynch at all. Boonskiies has, if I'm counting properly, 2 votes, and it's 7 to lynch. All he's done here is say that as long as Boonskiies is playing like he is, he's comfortable with his vote where it is, if I've read him right. <br><br>I'm making a big assumption here in that I think that if Boonskiies stops being useless, Riabi'll be looking elsewhere. But his read in 149 listed him as his strongest scum lean, and he's added a reason for his vote. That isn't a contradiction."}

What I said was at that moment, you were feeling either bad town or scum.  It wasn't because it was page 8.  It wasn't because you weren't giving out actual reads.  It was because it was page 8, you weren't giving out actual reads, and you were instead harping on and on over something that had, IMO, no potential.  There are many thing scum can do to mess with town, and wasting time is one of them.

Depending on the player, some scum get very focused on their own scum game and maybe be unable to view and discuss one of their actions as if they were town.  I think most players are able to discuss things fine, but maybe some newbscum may struggle with it."}

He is definitely asking mostly good questions that I think are useful. <span class=\"noboldsig\">Lean-town</span><br><br>Espressojet \u2013 Outside of calling out RC for his stretch comment(which I agree, by the way, was a stretch), he hasn\u2019t brought much to the table, at least in the last few days.

Voting me isn't scummy. And his reason for voting me is right: I was just stating things other people had, that I agreed with.

There was no \"yeah but\" involved so it's pretty fair to say that they are meant to be taken as \"I want to lynch player a for b and c\" and this was confirmed as the intention by Riabi, so I'm not off about this. They're not inconsistent statements and it bugs me that he tried to pass them off as such.<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6079345#p6079345\">269</a> has him asking me if Riabi seems to be a newer player to me. I asked him what difference that makes in the ensuing posts, and that is never answered. Seems like such an odd question to be ignored; then again, he asked me an odd question to begin with, since he actually wanted me to give my read on Riabi. <br><br>and finally, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6096447#p6096447\">507</a> has him asking people to scumhunt for him and ultimately picks something out from, like, the first five pages of the game when we're on page 21 as a reason to vote a slot.</div></div></div><br><br>I did a lot of writing over the last few hours and no one's going to read everything I have to say, but for completion's sake, I'm going to say that I think Elyse and Riabi are town, and I'm not willing to vote for Reinoe in light of his claim. I'm leaning scum on Slandaar, EspressoJet, Acryon, and I'm reading null on everyone else. Willing to explain any of those reads, though."}

This itself doesn't strike me as scummy, no, but her last post said something along the lines of that she had nothing to say. There was a pretty lot of activity at that point, and scum try to lay low to avoid slipping that they know more than they do. That seems to be what it looks like she was doing.<br><br>2. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6098077#p6098077\">541</a>: Why did he pull up Acryon's post 98 as \"proof\" that acryon was scum? He'd made it known that he thought Acryon was scum, yes, but largely due to Acryon's responses to the wagon on him. Reinoe's vote on him happened in post 361. What exactly felt fake about him? He never says, but there's a ton of material to use in the game. Why wasn't any of that used?<br><br>3. Claiming a hard-to-confirm power role at L-2 and without prompting. He says he didn't actually lie about his claim in that one game, and as far as I can tell, that is true. I also consider it to be semantics. During the end-game discussion, he says he told his scumbuddies to make a particular claim if it looked like they were going to be lynched because that claim was hard-to-confirm. <br><br>4. The color-code thing. It is a moot point because the mod said it was against the rules, and it's phrasing leads me to believe that this is a site-wide rule.

When the light shined through the world, Reinoe got to see his mother. Her mother was proud of him, no matter what. It was a tearful moment. But just because there was light, didn't mean darkness was nonexistent. As much as he wanted to be a nurse, he just wasn't smart enough. He was also shy and sheltered, and was the constant target for bullies. He applied for a nurse job, but failed to get it. Multiple time, infact! All ended in failures. Reinoe was still going to keep trying. When Mr. N died. The thought that someone committed murder, scared him. While <span class=\"noboldsig\">Sala</span> looked at the files he took some colored pencils and began to doodle. While he was doodling, someone snagged his colored pencils. It was<span class=\"noboldsig\"> DarkLightA</span>. He then punched Reinoe in the face. They began to fight until Sala and Mykonian broke up the fight...<br><br>\"It's not me\" Reinoe says, \"I just want to become a nurse\"<br><br>I looked at him, and he looked at me. He knew that he was going to see his mother very soon. He began to cry and ran off to the bathroom.<br><br>I sighed and put my head down for a little while.

In fact, there are good scum who play better town than some town do.  Isn't that the whole reason we lynched Reinoe?  There were plenty of valid arguments on him despite the fact that he was town, because he wasn't playing good town.  Scum can do good town actions as part of a master plan, and town can do scummy actions on accident/out of ignorance."}

I was under the impression that it was a bad idea to lynch because the validity of that claim could be more accurately judged on a later day.<br>Finally I moved back to reinoe because that was obviously going to be the lynch so I just pulled the trigger.  Also I didn't think it was a bad lynch cause nurse is a sketchy thing to claim."}

The primary reason I wanted to vote joker for was low content, and that problem was fixed by replacement.<br>So I moved to Slandaar.  Not exactly sure why I moved back to reinoe.

So back to reinoe.<br>Then I moved back to Slandaar.  This time it was because of reinoe's claim.  I was under the impression that it was a bad idea to lynch because the validity of that claim could be more accurately judged on a later day.<br>Finally I moved back to reinoe because that was obviously going to be the lynch so I just pulled the trigger.

Isn't the ideal town someone who is bringing actual things to the table?  The fact that you are acting the way you are consistently to \"avoid looking scummy\" makes no sense.

By using votes in this manner somewhat frivolously, it actually weakens what the vote means, and works against your whole purpose for doing it.  If everyone knows that votes don't mean much until it gets to at least L-2, then why would scum or anyone else feel pressured until that point?  And as I said, most of my scum-read of Elyse is rooted in Slandaar's conversation with her, and it's not necessarily a strong scum-read at this point.  My strongest scum-read is kush, so if I was to put my vote on anyone, it would be him."}

Reinoe also claimed a power role. One he didn't have, but he was town. After the power role claim, and with people looking elsewhere, Elyse used Reinoe's awful color-code play to get the wagon back on him. Mea culpa, but even after I sought out Reinoe's other game where he used that tactic and discovered him town in it, whereas the one in which he was scum, he was <span style=\"font-style: italic\">asked</span>, she still wanted him lynched.<br><br>I went along with it because it's an awful, awful play, and I felt that the 1 vs 1 situation, even with him being asked for the code instead of asking, IIRC, he went along with it. That made the behavior in this game null at best, and the nurse claim was very difficult to confirm. Plus, I really hate no-lynches, and I didn't think we had time to run up another wagon.<br><br>I'm seeing the same behavior with Elyse here. There's been a power role claimed, and the function of it has been confirmed. Hiplop's behavior with regards to those questions I kept asking him leads me to believe his town jailkeeper claim, but Elyse is insisting he's scum. I'm not comfortable with that, given how Day 1 ended."}

If hip were scum RB, the optimal play by far would have been to RB Candice again, and kill someone else.  RBing an unknown and killing the cop makes no sense when you can effectively nullify the PR, which is just as good as killing her.   Not only that, but keeping her alive keeps her in hip's pocket, and makes it appear to us that they are both potentially confirmed town PRs.<br><br>Ugh, I think hip is actually JK."}

You have really outplayed the town for a huge portion of this game but for some reason I am still alive and after spending a lot of time thinking I just caught you right at the death. When you were talking about  how Espresso was scum using such bad reasons I should have known something was up with you but I was so focused on lynching Espresso I left you be I won't do that again. You are a very clever player but very clever players don't make such bad arguments when they are town. I wish you good luck!"}

Same place I was at, but no Ashley. I pulled out the microphone. I thought of Alexandra. She loved to talk, she even said if things got back to normal and Josephine fell that she would love to be a journalist or a broadcaster. She just loved current events and the news, and why not? Half of the news back then was about us. <br><br>Then a great light appeared. I was blinded, all I saw was white, but while I was blinded, I could have sworn I saw something. What was that?<br><br>The microphone was gone. In my hand was something else. A weapon that came in handy when I needed it most, when we were backed against the wall, a sign that we couldn't give up when the going gets tough.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #008000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">The Magimence Wand...</span></span></span></span><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Mykonian</span> came in, informing me of the death of <span class=\"noboldsig\">Csareo</span>.

He was also smoking his last cigarette. So yeah, he was pissed. He wanted vengeance, he wanted those responsible to pay. He was tired of waiting for Salamence to make the move. It was time.<br><br>The other 6 students remaining were upstairs in the classroom, doing what they normally do. Slandaar came in and locked the door. <br><br>\"What the hell!?\" Said <span class=\"noboldsig\">Elyse.</span><br><br>\"Shut the fuck up\" Slandaar said, pulling a gun out. \"WHOEVER KILLED MY BEST FRIEND <span class=\"noboldsig\">RIABI</span> DIES TODAY!\"<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Hiplop</span> screamed like a girl, <span class=\"noboldsig\">Acryon</span> and <span class=\"noboldsig\">DarkLightA</span> freaked out, <span class=\"noboldsig\">Bob</span> yelled \"COME AT ME BRO\" until Elyse dragged him out.<br><br>There was just <span class=\"noboldsig\">RedCoyote</span>. Who was on his computer and didn't give a damn. \"Red,\" Slandaar said, \"Get up and go over to the side\".<br><br>\"I don't feel like it. I'm busy.\" Slandaar then pulled the gun up to his face. Red then slammed his computer, looked at slandaar and said, \"shoot hiplop.\"<br><br>\"FUCKING. MOVE.\" Red moved.<br><br>Everyone was on one side of the classroom, and Slandaar was on the other side.<br><br>Mykonian, AngryPidgeon, and I slammed the door open with a burst of air. I pointed the wand at Slandaar. He then dropped the gun, \"I- I just wanted revenge\"<br><br>I looked at Slandaar and could see what he was feeling. I felt the magimence wand and I knew who was going down.<br><br>\"<span style=\"color: #FFFF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">THUNDER!</span></span></span>\" I pointed at Hiplop. Instead of being shocked to death, it was blocked... by dark magic.<br><br>Hiplop laughed like a woman, a dark aura covered him.

This wasn't part of the plan, was it time to panic? Was the light resurging? Uh oh.

He then effectively <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6229973#p6229973\" class=\"postlink\">dropped his Elyse case</a> and called me out as scum <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6236727#p6236727\" class=\"postlink\">for suspecting Espresso</a> (among other things but this was obviously his primary reason). Slandaar has a very \"do as I say, not as I do\" approach to the game. This post in particular is a pretty big offender because it shows Slandaar trying to derail the hiplop wagon in favor of a wagon on me in the last days of D4. Predictably, hiplop joined up with him shortly thereafter. <br><br>The second big reason I want to see Slandaar gone is his now infamous \"confirmed\" farce. I'm sure everyone remembers this gem:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6218834#p6218834\" class=\"postlink\">post 1563</a>, Slandaar wrote:</cite>Slandaar is confirmed town.</div></blockquote><br><br>Because Slandaar hasn't been able to successfully retort me, I encourage anyone else to try now that we have seen hiplop flip as a scum roleblocker. What's to stop a scum roleblocker from saying they blocked their partner to \"confirm\" him to the town? Slandaar says that scum would never do that because it <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6222068#p6222068\" class=\"postlink\">\"seems bad\"</a>. Literally that's all he said in response to me. Do you agree with this? Is it bad for scum to help make their partner look more town? Why? I think it's a very sound strategy because hiplop afforded Slandaar the ability to come out and say, \"Oh, I'm confirmed, I'm confirmed!\" It's the exact same thing as a scum team no killing and then the fakeclaimed \"doctor\" saying they protected their scumbuddy that night or something. Given the <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6216669#p6216669\" class=\"postlink\">buddy-buddy</a> relationship of hiplop and Slandaar, I have no problems with this conclusion. <br><br>The third major reason is the three of Slandaar/DLA/Elyse <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6231417#p6231417\" class=\"postlink\">framing me</a>. The town player among you three needs to take a step back and put yourself in my shoes for a second. I did not realize hiplop was at L-1 or else I wouldn't have unvoted him. If it hasn't already been made quite apparent, I don't sit in front of the thread with a spreadsheet and a calculator analyze the perfect stratagem for taking other players out or playing \"gotcha\" games much like Slandaar has been doing. I unvoted hiplop because that was what my heart was telling me to do at the time after seeing Slandaar consistently throw everything at me because I had the audacity to stand up to him and his \"confirmed town\" remark. This whole game, whom among us has been willing to stand up to Slandaar? Myself and acryon. That's it. Others have thrown piddly suspicion his way (like <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6160764#p6160764\" class=\"postlink\">hiplop</a>, lol), but nothing really meaningful. As soon as I started asking Slandaar some tougher questions and shining a bit more light on his manuevers, he blows his gasket and goes as far as to try and derail the obvious scumwagon on hiplop to try and get me killed to presumably win the game."}

He has one of them eating out of his hand completely. <br><br>Then I saw you made a post where you said something to the effect of, \"Slandaar isn't confirmed, but it doesn't matter\", which was a much more palatable reaction even though it was a bit too indifferent for my taste. I took it to mean you saw he was bullshitting but that you didn't care because either/both 1) you thought Slandaar was town and/or 2) you wanted to lynch between hiplop/acryon yesterday so you paid it no mind."}

I was frustrated at the game D4 because Slandaar had been able to successfully domineer the conversation and completely write the script of the game, but with the game stagnated like this, I no longer have any sympathy for the town. I've made my case and said my piece.* I've yet to see anyone seriously challenge me besides Slandaar's token \"if hiplop and I were scum together, he wouldn't try to clear me... that would be a bad play\", DLA regurgitating the same point he had over two weeks ago with a new (yet just as trivial) twist (as though he wasn't guilty of the same thing in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6225203#p6225203\">1669</a>), Elyse who has buddied up to Slandaar this entire game without so much as a question for him in over a month. The most engagement I've gotten from Elyse thus far has been <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6261054#p6261054\">1922</a> with no evidence or legwork to back it up whatsoever.<br><br>I'm not sitting here saying that it's obviously Slandaar. It isn't. You actually have to take the time to put 2 and 2 together vis-a-vis his interactions with hiplop, how he changed his reads on him, how he deliberately went out of his way to keep him alive on D2 and D3 and how he \"directed\" hiplop's power without so much as a protest from hiplop. But it sure is easier to just assume that Slandaar is telling you the truth about how hiplop confirmed him at his behest... but hiplop would never do that if Slandaar was scum with him! Only if he was town. Because, you know, that makes so much sense for hiplop to help the town out and all. <br><br>But, yeah, don't talk about that stuff, right, DLA? Right, Elyse? Because he's confirmed. He just is. <br><br>*For the record, this is exactly why I made <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6260900#p6260900\">1919</a>. I didn't even really want to bother taking the time to present this evidence to you two because I knew you were both too stubborn to give me a chance intellectually. So I was reluctant to even spend the time and energy on this. I'm glad I did though, even if I get lynched. Because at least I can then not feel any blame whatsoever for this loss and take a smidgen of pride in the appreciation I'll get in the dead thread for continuing to fight in the face of inevitability."}

Of course now he's using hindsight to justify his earlier position as though it matters at all now what kush flipped. That's so disingenuous. Besides, scum know all the alignments anyway. Of course you're going to read players that haven't flipped yet as scum or town (e.g. me townreading Slaandar based on his Elyse/hiplop case early in the game), but the problem was that Slaandar, at the time, made a compelling case. I was townreading him based on his actions, not purely the reads themselves. It wouldn't have mattered if he chose Elyse/hiplop or Candice/Bob... it was how he presented it that mattered. In this DLA/kush scenario, all DLA had said was that kush was \"unmotivated\" and that it didn't jive with his old meta. <br><br>I could see someone agree with that, but you certainly don't go so far as to say (which Slaandar did) that DLA was town because he threw up some meta links and made a obvious point about activity parallels. Further, Slaandar was trying to say that DLA's read on kush was \"brilliant\" (it actually wasn't because, as has been pointed out, kush flipped town), and therefore DLA was town. So, like, he was saying DLA is town because his read on kush is brilliant. His read on kush is brilliant because DLA is town. That doesn't really work. I thought it was awkward and forced at the time and I still think it's awkward and forced now. It really matters because I could see these two as partners."}

Given that Slandaar + her could've simply lynched me by now, odds are that it's DLA &amp; Slandaar. This also makes sense with how Slandaar has consistently been sprinkling unprovoked townreads on DLA over the course of the game (see <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6124718#p6124718\">915</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6150666#p6150666\">1113</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6160669#p6160669\">1137</a>, etc.) whilst pushing attacks on Elyse with the same consistency (many examples of this, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6115136#p6115136\">844</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6135199#p6135199\">967</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6140478#p6140478\">987</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6141040#p6141040\">1002</a>, etc.) I think DLA misjudged Elyse and moved too soon to try and get me lynched today. The only motivation for Elyse to delay this long is as town that is having second thoughts seeing as though I don't think she's partnered with DLA or you. I don't see the scum motivation for Elyse to delay the day any longer."}

Slandaar was pretty confident in me scum (another thing that makes it strange he made it this far if I was scum, but that's WIFOM I know), but a Bob kill would have been weird for either one of us. For me, it would be stupid since Slandaar would probably push me, but if DLA killed you, it would make Slandaar think why he was still alive and then potentially make him switch. The NK was a tough choice, but the way things went down made it seem like Slandaar was dying (his posts at the end of the day especially), so I think your death could have been a huge red flag pointing to DLA."}

Ironically, had Candice played weaker, he may have had more of a chance to use his powers. From the start of the game Candice was one of my worries. Thank for running this one, Sal. With the exception of that heavy-handedness at the end, I liked your style. I would advise adding links somewhere in your OP in future games just to make things a little more convenient for the players, but other than that I was pleased with the administrative side of the game. gg everyone."}
