{"number": 1, "id": "6051893", "user": "Salamence20", "user_id": "14358", "content": "Rules (Stolen from the legendary Skullduggery):<br>\n<br>\nGeneral Etiquette:<br>\n(1) Play to win. Be competitive. Don't be lame. Don't flake out on us.<br>\n(2) Do not take screenshots or directly quote any of the PMs that I send you. Doing so will result in a mod-kill. Pretending to break this rule is the same as actually breaking it. You may paraphrase, but use caution. When in doubt, run it by me first.<br>\n(3) Do not edit any of your posts, if you have the ability to do so.<br>\n(4) Do not use encrypted text, hidden text, small text, or any other hard-to-read text when posting.<br>\n(5) Once you have been lynched or killed, you are out of the game. Do not post anymore until the game is over. That means no \"Bah!\" posts, please.<br>\n(6) Do not talk about this game with anybody else outside of this thread unless your role PM explicitly says that you can.<br>\n(7) Heated discussion is fine, but personal attacks, insults, flaming, and poor sportsmanship are not. Please don't be a jerk to your fellow players. If I feel that your behavior is preventing other players from enjoying the game, I reserve the right to force-replace or mod-kill you.<br>\n(8) Do not talk about ongoing games. Seriously, don't.<br>\n<br>\nDay, Night, and Twilight:<br>\n(9) Each Day phase will last for two weeks apiece and each Night phase will last for two days apiece. I will post specific deadlines in the game thread at the start of every Day and Night phase.<br>\n(10) Players may continue to talk during Twilight, including the player that has been lynched.<br>\n(11) If you do not send me your Night action before the specified deadline, I will assume that you are not performing an action on that Night. <br>\n(12) If you know you will be unavailable during a Night phase, you may send me your night action during the preceding Day phase if you so desire.<br>\n(13) Deadline extension requests will be considered on a case-by-case basis.<br>\n<br>\nVoting:<br>\n(14) Please post all votes and unvotes using either the bold tag or the vote tag. Votes should look like this: <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: Salamence</div> or <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Sala</span><br>\n(15) Unvotes are helpful, but not necessary.<br>\n(16) Please refrain from engaging in any kind of voting trickery. If it looks like a vote, I'm counting it as a vote.<br>\n(17) A lynch will only occur when a majority (more than 50% of all possible votes) is reached. The number of votes needed to hammer will be included with every vote count.<br>\n(18) If a majority is not reached by the deadline, there will be no lynch on that Day.<br>\n(19) Once a hammer occurs, no votes or unvotes will prevent the lynch from happening.<br>\n(20) Additional votes include VOTE: No Lynch to end the Day with no lynch (which will also require a majority) and VOTE: Draw to end the game in a draw (which will require 100% agreement from all living players).<br>\n<br>\nActivity:<br>\n(21) You will be expected to post at least once every 48 hours. If you go more than 48 hours without posting, you will be prodded.<br>\n(22) If you receive a prod, you will have 24 hours to post in the game thread. If you do not respond to your prod within 24 hours, you will be replaced. Additionally, if I have to prod you more than three times, you will be replaced.<br>\n(23) If you know that you will have limited access to the game for more than a few days, please let me know either in the thread or via PM.<br>\n<br>\nCommunication with the Moderator:<br>\n(24) I may be cooler and sexier than you, but I do still make mistakes every now and then. If you notice an error with the vote counts, deadlines, or anything else related to the game, please let me know and I will correct the issue.<br>\n(25) I will not answer any role-related questions in the game thread. If you have any questions about your role, the (theoretical) roles of any other players in the game, or (theoretical) role interactions, send me a PM. Do not try to trick me into confirming a player's role. I will not be amused.<br>\n(26) If you need to get my attention, just include <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">@Mod</div> or <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">@Salamence</div> in your post.<br>\n<br>\nMiscellaneous:<br>\n(27) If you have any problems with another player, send me a PM and I will do my best to resolve the issue.<br>\n(28) If a player is mod-killed during the Day phase, then that Day will end immediately.<br>\n(29) <div style=\"display:inline;color:#0040FF\">My color is blue (#0040FF) DON&#8217;T USE IT</div><br>\n(30) The flavor text is for entertainment purposes only. Analyze it at your own risk.<br>\n(31) Do not ask me to mod-kill, force-replace, or discipline any other player in the game. That is my decision to make, not yours.<br>\n(32) As the moderator, my word is final. Please respect my instructions and my decisions.<br>\n(33) I reserve the right to change these rules during the game if necessary. If this happens, I will inform everybody of the rule change in the thread.<br>\n(34) In addition to these rules, all site-wide rules also apply.<br>\n(35) Claiming color code is prohibited. <br>\n<br>\nHere is the VT PM, <br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>VT PM wrote:</cite>Greetings, Salamence20, you are a <div style=\"display:inline;color:#00FF00\">Vanilla Townie.</div> You can talk during the day and sleep during the night. You also have a vote that allows you to lynch anyone you want, or to not use it at all. You win when all threats to the town have been defeated.

While I was reading along in this thread, I was kind of caught up in another game, and had a difficult time actually following some of the conversations in this thread. I gave this thread a re-read just now, and made some notes. Here's where I stand:<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">acryon</div> - I was really getting a town vibe from him up until around post 130. I totally disagree with the idea that \"this direction is not the one we should be going in\" regardless of what that direction is. Everyone has different ideas about how to scumhunt, and to reject those ideas out of hand seems scummy. If someone really is town, why not answer questions directed at them? Null, but shaky.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">RC</div> and <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">elyse</div> both seem to be asking good questions and getting good discussion going. Lean town.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">hiplop</div> - While changing one's mind is ok, and having the ability and willingness to do so is, IMO, crucial to the town's success... this guy just doesn't seem to have any opinions at all. To me, he seems to be trying to guess which way the flow of the game/voting is going to go, hoping he can jump on a wave and ride it into the endgame. Lean scum.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Candice</div> - My read on him is similar to hiplop, but to a lesser degree. To me, it seems important to have opinions in this game. The more the better. If you're wrong, you're wrong, but, it seems to me that the more opinions town has, the more discussion, and the more info we have to base our other reads on. Lean slightly scum.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Slandaar</div> - Similar to acryon above, there is a lot of what I view as pro-town activity in his posts, with one glaring exception... If you have reads, why in the world wouldn't you share them? Null, but suspicious.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">joker443</div> - Yeah, there just seems to be something... weird there. Maybe she's just a bit odd, and has a very different way of looking at the world than me, but, I'm really not liking the lack of any scum reads at all. Lean scum, FOS.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">boonskiies</div> - He's not given me any reason at all to even consider changing my vote right now. It's not the lack of post count that bothers me, it's the complete and total lack of anything resembling opinion or discussion in them that bothers me. Strong lean scum.", "time": "Fri Aug 01, 2014 4:19 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=58587&start=125", "forum": "53", "thread": "58587"}

I get your read on me, but at the same time, Slandaar seems to be asking the same questions over and over while ignoring the responses of those that are answering.  Surely I can stop responding at some point?  I've already explained that I don't think Slandaar is even scumhunting, whether he or anyone else agrees or not.  And I thought I explained that pretty well earlier.  If you don't accept that, then we'll have to agree to disagree.<br>\n<br>\nAnd as for your argument on percentage, it's a stretch to call your 3rd post really substantive.  If anything it is your 1 post vs. their 0 posts.  The problem with looking by percentage is that some players' play-styles include fluff-posts and small comments, while others do not, so it is hard to compare the two percentage-wise.

Good post.<br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Candice 139 wrote:</cite>RC, if you really believe that was a scumtell, please say so.

If I find a logical reason for voting someone, whether it's small or large, I'm going to do it. How others interpret what I say is their business, but I was assuredly not voting kush as a joke or anything like that. Additionally, kush has not done anything to get me to really feel much better about him, but a couple of people have done things that made me feel worse about them (hiplop and joker). <br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\nI love, love, love Riabi's <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6076415#p6076415\">149</a>. Very clear and concise. Everything he says is explained. I'm also glad he's got an avatar now. Indeed, he may have shot to the top of my town reads with that single post. <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Riabi 162 wrote:</cite>I had less of an issue with that and more of an issue with the phrase \"starting to\" and the word \"kinda\".

That said, I can buy that it's mostly a playstyle thing, and I'll try to keep that in mind going forward.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nThis is good as well. Maybe a touch hard of Candice (although I agree with Riabi's point, I think something has to be said for assessing the players on a case-by-case basis... while I've never played with Candice to my recollection, he strikes me as the insecure, for lack of a better word, type that may not be the one to take the first strike, but once he's found what he's looking for, he'll come after one hard), but I can forgive that as I could just be too naive and unsuspecting toward Candice.<br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>hiplop 166 wrote:</cite>Pretty damn sure that slandaar/candice discussion means they are town.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nI agree with this, but I'd like to think I've documented as to how I've got there.

Not only is this just good participation, it's also consistent with his implied belief that town should be answering questions asked of them (see his read on Acryon in 149).<br>\n<br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6076562#p6076562\">160</a>: Engaging Acryon, admits that he has a point and defends himself, and also reiterates his question for Acryon (still engaging other players).<br>\n<br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6078790#p6078790\">253</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6078822#p6078822\">257</a>: I'm not seeing the inconsistency here either, Kush. \"Strong lean scum\" doesn't conflict with \"if he's town he's useless\". It is allowing for the possibility that Boonskiies is town, which is actually a possibility. But I find it kind of disingenuous to say that Riabi is going for a lynch at all. Boonskiies has, if I'm counting properly, 2 votes, and it's 7 to lynch. All he's done here is say that as long as Boonskiies is playing like he is, he's comfortable with his vote where it is, if I've read him right. <br>\n<br>\nI'm making a big assumption here in that I think that if Boonskiies stops being useless, Riabi'll be looking elsewhere. But his read in 149 listed him as his strongest scum lean, and he's added a reason for his vote. That isn't a contradiction.", "time": "Sat Aug 02, 2014 6:50 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=58587&start=275", "forum": "53", "thread": "58587"}

It was because it was page 8, you weren't giving out actual reads, and you were instead harping on and on over something that had, IMO, no potential.  There are many thing scum can do to mess with town, and wasting time is one of them.

Doesn't answer a repeated question about his misrepresentation of what I said about power roles (or about scumhunting). As a bonus, he claims that he said in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6069920#p6069920\">93</a> that he said that he didn't consider acryon's clunky phrasing to be indicative of alignment, but post 93 literally says \"I could buy aco-scum\" and then mentions the clunky posts in the same paragraph!

I think reinoe's sentiment here was very clear. <br>\n<br>\nThat said, I've got the same strong scumread on Kush (continued from my second post):<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: </b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\"><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6067065#p6067065\">75</a> has him saying, in short, that he doesn't think Bob's going to explain his actions.

There was no \"yeah but\" involved so it's pretty fair to say that they are meant to be taken as \"I want to lynch player a for b and c\" and this was confirmed as the intention by Riabi, so I'm not off about this.

He says he didn't actually lie about his claim in that one game, and as far as I can tell, that is true. I also consider it to be semantics.

When he was two, his mother fell ill and died. Later on in life, he vowed to become a doctor, no matter what! When Alexandra slayed Josephine, Reinoe was 12. When the light shined through the world, Reinoe got to see his mother. Her mother was proud of him, no matter what. It was a tearful moment. But just because there was light, didn't mean darkness was nonexistent. As much as he wanted to be a nurse, he just wasn't smart enough. He was also shy and sheltered, and was the constant target for bullies. He applied for a nurse job, but failed to get it. Multiple time, infact! All ended in failures. Reinoe was still going to keep trying. When Mr. N died. The thought that someone committed murder, scared him. While <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Sala</div> looked at the files he took some colored pencils and began to doodle. While he was doodling, someone snagged his colored pencils. It was<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"> DarkLightA</div>. He then punched Reinoe in the face. They began to fight until Sala and Mykonian broke up the fight...<br>\n<br>\n\"It's not me\" Reinoe says, \"I just want to become a nurse\"<br>\n<br>\nI looked at him, and he looked at me. He knew that he was going to see his mother very soon. He began to cry and ran off to the bathroom.<br>\n<br>\nI sighed and put my head down for a little while.

Because if I was scum with hiplop and Candice was town (which I'm confident he is), I would've killed Candice or someone else that would get another person in trouble. Like Slandaar's two individual points (status quo and keeping hiplop as a scummy but not too scummy read) don't work together, which ultimately makes his case fail. He's acting like there's only one scum and it's me and it seems very shortsighted from him. I think he's taking advantage of a read I'm having trouble with and trying to get me in trouble for it.

Reinoe also claimed a power role. One he didn't have, but he was town. After the power role claim, and with people looking elsewhere, Elyse used Reinoe's awful color-code play to get the wagon back on him. Mea culpa, but even after I sought out Reinoe's other game where he used that tactic and discovered him town in it, whereas the one in which he was scum, he was <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">asked</div>, she still wanted him lynched.<br>\n<br>\nI went along with it because it's an awful, awful play, and I felt that the 1 vs 1 situation, even with him being asked for the code instead of asking, IIRC, he went along with it. That made the behavior in this game null at best, and the nurse claim was very difficult to confirm. Plus, I really hate no-lynches, and I didn't think we had time to run up another wagon.<br>\n<br>\nI'm seeing the same behavior with Elyse here. There's been a power role claimed, and the function of it has been confirmed.

You know, I've cut you a lot of slack this game, acryon, but this is starting to wear on my nerves. Not voting should be extraordinary, not ordinary. Heck, I think when players aren't voting they ought to be explaining that just as much, if not more, than when they are voting. Because when you vote someone, there's already an implication you think they're scum (even if you don't necessarily elaborate on that), but when you're not voting at all, then you don't get even that.<br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>BB 1146 wrote:</cite>massclaim?</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nYes, I agree to this.

I'm sure everyone remembers this gem:<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6218834#p6218834\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6218834#p6218834\" data-post-id=\"6218834\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 1563</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=16634\">Slandaar</a> wrote:</cite>Slandaar is confirmed town.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nBecause Slandaar hasn't been able to successfully retort me, I encourage anyone else to try now that we have seen hiplop flip as a scum roleblocker. What's to stop a scum roleblocker from saying they blocked their partner to \"confirm\" him to the town? Slandaar says that scum would never do that because it <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6222068#p6222068\" class=\"postlink\">\"seems bad\"</a>. Literally that's all he said in response to me. Do you agree with this? Is it bad for scum to help make their partner look more town? Why? I think it's a very sound strategy because hiplop afforded Slandaar the ability to come out and say, \"Oh, I'm confirmed, I'm confirmed!\" It's the exact same thing as a scum team no killing and then the fakeclaimed \"doctor\" saying they protected their scumbuddy that night or something. Given the <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6216669#p6216669\" class=\"postlink\">buddy-buddy</a> relationship of hiplop and Slandaar, I have no problems with this conclusion. <br>\n<br>\nThe third major reason is the three of Slandaar/DLA/Elyse <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6231417#p6231417\" class=\"postlink\">framing me</a>. The town player among you three needs to take a step back and put yourself in my shoes for a second. I did not realize hiplop was at L-1 or else I wouldn't have unvoted him. If it hasn't already been made quite apparent, I don't sit in front of the thread with a spreadsheet and a calculator analyze the perfect stratagem for taking other players out or playing \"gotcha\" games much like Slandaar has been doing. I unvoted hiplop because that was what my heart was telling me to do at the time after seeing Slandaar consistently throw everything at me because I had the audacity to stand up to him and his \"confirmed town\" remark. This whole game, whom among us has been willing to stand up to Slandaar? Myself and acryon. That's it. Others have thrown piddly suspicion his way (like <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6160764#p6160764\" class=\"postlink\">hiplop</a>, lol), but nothing really meaningful. As soon as I started asking Slandaar some tougher questions and shining a bit more light on his manuevers, he blows his gasket and goes as far as to try and derail the obvious scumwagon on hiplop to try and get me killed to presumably win the game.", "time": "Fri Oct 03, 2014 1:35 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=58587&start=1925", "forum": "53", "thread": "58587"}

You actually have to take the time to put 2 and 2 together vis-a-vis his interactions with hiplop, how he changed his reads on him, how he deliberately went out of his way to keep him alive on D2 and D3 and how he \"directed\" hiplop's power without so much as a protest from hiplop. But it sure is easier to just assume that Slandaar is telling you the truth about how hiplop confirmed him at his behest... but hiplop would never do that if Slandaar was scum with him! Only if he was town. Because, you know, that makes so much sense for hiplop to help the town out and all. <br>\n<br>\nBut, yeah, don't talk about that stuff, right, DLA? Right, Elyse? Because he's confirmed. He just is. <br>\n<br>\n*For the record, this is exactly why I made <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6260900#p6260900\">1919</a>. I didn't even really want to bother taking the time to present this evidence to you two because I knew you were both too stubborn to give me a chance intellectually. So I was reluctant to even spend the time and energy on this. I'm glad I did though, even if I get lynched. Because at least I can then not feel any blame whatsoever for this loss and take a smidgen of pride in the appreciation I'll get in the dead thread for continuing to fight in the face of inevitability.", "time": "Mon Oct 06, 2014 3:46 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=58587&start=1950", "forum": "53", "thread": "58587"}

I was townreading him based on his actions, not purely the reads themselves. It wouldn't have mattered if he chose Elyse/hiplop or Candice/Bob... it was how he presented it that mattered.

Her first name? Who gives a fuck? Or is it that she thinks no one gives a fuck? I don&#8217;t know. Just know her name is Benson. Benson was having a campfire deep in the heart of the <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">foglands</div>, the scariest place in the land due to the thick fog, unpredictable environment, and wild beasts. Many citizens from <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Appleby Heights</div> and <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Kondi</div> stay away from there. The only inhabitants of the foglands were a group of uncivilized people known as the <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Fogermen.</div> The fogerman are said to be born with half a brain and would not survive in normal society such as Appleby Heights and Kondi.
