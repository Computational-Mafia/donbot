All other role information is secret, including how many players with a certain role exist and even if the role exists in the first place. <br><br>2.\tTo vote for a player, bold the word \"vote\" followed by said player's name, e.g. <span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: Jackal711</span>. As long as I can tell to whom you are referring, spelling does not count and I will accept abbreviated or otherwise shortened forms of the name of the vote's recipient. If you change your mind about whom you want lynched, you must bold an unvote, preferably in the format <span class=\"noboldsig\">Unvote: Jackal711</span>. You may also Vote: No Lynch, and Unvote: No Lynch.  Use of the vote and unvote tags is also allowed, and preferred.<br><br>3.\tA majority of votes is required for a lynch, even at deadline. Once a lynch has been decided, it is final and further votes and unvotes do not count for the current day. If deadline is reached with no player having enough votes for a lynch, the day ends in an automatic No Lynch.<br><br>4.\tOnce you're lynched, nightkilled, or modkilled (a modkill ends the day ONLY if the modkilled player is pro-town), I'll allow one \"bah\" post that doesn't contain any game-related content if you wish to make it, but you must thereafter stop posting in the game. Said \"bah\" post is the only post a dead player may make during twilight. Living players may continue to talk during twilight as long as they follow all of the rules. <br><br>5.\tYou are not forced to like each other, but the fact that you badly want so and so offed does not give you the right to insult him or her. Please keep your hatred of people or groups thereof to yourself unless you want a warning. Three warnings (or an offensive enough post) and you will be ejected from the game and replaced with someone else.<br><br>6.\tDo not hide text or otherwise hinder its readability by using spoiler tags, invisible text, etc. THIS INCLUDES ENCRYPTED TEXT! You may, however, post in any color that can be easily read against the forum background other than <span style=\"color: blue\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">blue</span></span>. This is my mod color. Violators will be warned. Doing it again will result in replacement.<br><br>7.\tImpersonating the moderator WILL NOT HAPPEN. Doing so, you will be replaced.<br><br>8.\tIf you somehow have the ability to edit or delete your posts in this forum, please DO NOT do so. If I catch you doing such, you will be replaced or modkilled.<br><br>9.\tYou are not allowed to discuss this game outside of the thread unless I tell you otherwise, and then only with whom I have allowed you to do so and at your specified time. This is a modkillable offense.<br><br>10.\tDiscussing an ongoing game in this game's thread gets you a warning the first time and a MODKILL the second time.<br><br>11.\tDo not quote or pretend to quote any private communication, either from me or from anyone else you are allowed to talk with at night. This includes your role PM. Violators will be modkilled. You are allowed to paraphrase, but you are not allowed to plagiarize. If in doubt as to your paraphrase's legality, PM me with the wording you want to use.<br><br>12.\tClaiming to be scum with someone else will result in a modkill.<br><br>13.\tI will issue a prod to any player that does not post for 72 hours without notifying me of his or her absence. If you are prodded, you will have 48 hours from the time of submission to post in thread. Failure to do so may result in replacement. I will only prod the same player twice. If a third prod is required, they will be replaced.<br><br>14.\tI am not God (or a Lawyer). I am only human and prone to making mistakes like any of us. If I do make a mistake please bring it to my attention either via PM or in thread. If addressing me in thread please do so in bold <span class=\"noboldsig\">@Mod: (message)</span><br><br>15.\tAll rules are subject to change. If there are changes I will point them out in the next posted vote count.<br><br>16.\tAll lynches and actions are considered to be done instantly. Obviously I can't be on all the time, so they will be posted as soon as possible. Night actions are considered to all happen at the same time. The principles of NAR (Natural Action Resolution) as discussed in the <a href=\"https://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Natural_Action_Resolution\" class=\"postlink\">Wiki</a> will apply in any conflict.<br><br>17.\tDeadlines will be 2 weeks for Days, and 48 hours for Night.<br><br>18.\tIf anyone gets modkilled, they will turn into a Neutral Survivor for all purposes and will lose the game. Day will also end immediately if they were town-aligned.<br><br>19.    The most important rule of all, saved for last for what I think is a very good reason: HAVE FUN! Enjoy! And good luck!"}

Being a new player, I thought that a comment like this would be cleared up from the mod. That never happened and it turned the town away from him. After the game ended with a scum win, the mod apologized for the IC playing dirty, but I still like to count it as a town win.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4089781#p4089781\" class=\"postlink\">post 30</a>, ICEninja wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Jee wrote:</cite>Really?

Your first vote, while still definitely RVS, showed that there was a factor that made a specific player more likely to be scum than others, despite a severe lack of information.

Do you honestly believe brundibar was trying to lynch someone strictly based on a name? I hope not. You pick name a from the list, and you give a random reason for the vote.

From brundi's past play, it was fairly likely that he would vote Pine, and Pine could have realized this and been using his \"reaction test\" intentionally. But it is only slightly more likely, because he does do gambits as Town, and there is little reason to go after brundi, other than him being easy to manipulate in this manner.

First off, for a while there, AV was focusing exclusively on you, which was bad, but his post #100 fixed that. He still finds you scummy, for his initial reasoning, which I don't agree with. But it is most likely bad play, which is a nulltell. The claim is that there was enough information at the time that you made your random vote that you shouldn't have been making a random vote, but should have instead commented on the existing information. I disagree with this, because different people have different thoughts on what amount of information is necessary to comment on something, so it is just indicative of differing playstyles. I don't want to make the same mistake that AV made, but I think that at this point you should be able to have something more than just a random vote where \"there isn't any substance\". So I find myself repeating AV's question and asking you why do you still have your random vote out there, rather than a more serious one?<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4095368#p4095368\" class=\"postlink\">post 103</a>, pieceofpecanpie wrote:</cite>I suggest Aurorus is one of two things:<br>a) scum trying to tunnel on someone to either convince others that they're scum or he's town or both. <br>b) an idiot</div></blockquote><br>Or a player who just has a different opinion on how much information is needed to comment on.

Wagons can be created, awkward defenses can be made, scum can be found. <span class=\"noboldsig\">I don't seen anything wrong with what brundibar making a name based vote and saying it will help with discussion.</span></div></blockquote><br>And in #69:<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4092947#p4092947\" class=\"postlink\">post 69</a>, jee wrote:</cite>The original argument still stands. <span class=\"noboldsig\">I believe a vote based on a name is just as random as any other vote that early in the game.</span></div></blockquote><br>The original argument is talking about my case against his accusation, not post #22.

First of all, although I might not have been comfortable putting an L-2 vote on Pine, once the vote was there I could not think of another player I would feel comfortable moving my vote onto enough to take my vote off of Pine. Secondly, multiple people had brought points against Pine, or points that they wanted Pine to respond to, and he had not responded to any of them at the time I made that post.

Night kills always land on town, where lynches don't. Anti-town players (Pine isn't ALWAYS anti-town, but he is pretty much always conceited and somewhat rude, which often gets mistaken for anti-town or even scummy) and is virtually always a lynch possibility, but rarely the first pick for a lynch, so he ends up surviving to late game all the time.

Scum will night kill him, which is fine because that means our strong pro-town players will survive to day 2.<br><br>That being said, I believe Pine would indeed be a pretty good judge of Nhammen's scum meta, so I think there is a very high likelihood of one scum between the two.<br><br>Actually to be honest I'm not comfortable with this day ending yet anyway.

Night kills always land on town, where lynches don't. Anti-town players (Pine isn't ALWAYS anti-town, but he is pretty much always conceited and somewhat rude, which often gets mistaken for anti-town or even scummy) and is virtually always a lynch possibility, but rarely the first pick for a lynch, so he ends up surviving to late game all the time.

Scum will night kill him, which is fine because that means our strong pro-town players will survive to day 2. </div></blockquote>What? WHAAAAAT!? <br>No. Scum will NOT nightkill him, because he's irritating and decidedly anti-town. Scum <span style=\"font-style: italic\">will not</span> night kill him, because he distracts all other players and is a really, really good scapegoat. Scum will kill their own buddies before they kill Pine, because Pine actively prevents scumcatching from getting done. <br>this is, of course, only when Pine is not scum. Then, Pine doesn't get Nightkilled because he's scum. Pine survives until the end of the game.<br><br>See, but Pine doesn't get lynched because he can always worm his way out of it. For some reason, we're always hesitant to lynch Pine. Look, even now, he makes a claim of a weak investigative role. It's not unbelievable, there's little chance he'll be counter-claimed, and there's little chance (since it's such a weak role) that he'll even draw the nigthkill for it. This is a perfect survival claim. You know who <span style=\"font-style: italic\">depends</span> on survival to win? Well, yeah, an SK. But it's more important for the two or three mafia to survive as long as possible, than it is for the town to. Pine survives until the end of the game. <br><br>Pine is Pine is Pine. There's no telling his alignment, and in my personal opinion, it's best to lynch him early, when the information is the most vague and the townies are the most willing to put through a meaningless vote. Because you can't lynch him later on. You just can't. It can't be done. You can't do it. Try it. You Can't.

The first is that doing such an evaluation will have too strong an influence on the townplayers. When we know what Arugula flipped, everyone should go back to see what they learned. If someone posts an evaluation now, it's far too easy for other townies to simply read that evaluation rather then think for themselves.<br><br>The other is that such a complete evaluation gives mafia far too much information. They'll know exactly where suspicions will be going and why. They'll know what they'll have to defend against, they'll know who they have to nightkill. It's far more difficult for them if they can't be entirely sure what to expect from day 2.<br><br>The third downside to doing an evaluation now is that you can't be as focussed when doing it. When you know what the flip was, you can look at the entire thread through that lens. When you don't know the flip, you'll continuously have \"but what if he flips otherwise?\" in the back of your mind, weakening the strength of your observations.<br><br>These three downsides together make up for the risk of getting nightkilled before you can do the analysis, IMO.<br><br>@whiskers: ICE not attacking AV right now is good for town. we'll need to get a lynch together. 2 votes for both pine and ICE, 0 for AV, 6 for Arugula. ICE switching to AV would bring Arugula to only 5, and thereby make a lynch significantly more difficult to achieve, with deadline only a day away."}

If we're already divided, and he's one of the candidates for lynch, you're not really dividing town FURTHER, instead, make a case for best scum and we'll lynch best scum. <br></div></blockquote><br>Right now town is really only divided 3 ways because I stopped pushing the AV lynch. If I pushed it, (and it seems like others would be willing to listen to me right now) town would be divided 4 ways, with deadline tomorrow. Doing this would help scum more than us, as it would force too many people to settle on a lynch instead of get the one they want, and scum will pretty much be able to talk their way out of any day 1 VCA.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Whiskers wrote:</cite>Hm, with your \"substantial case,\" do you really need an Aru townflip to attack AVox?<br></div></blockquote><br>A town flip of Aru makes my already substantial case stronger. I did not need an Aru flip to vote AV earlier today, and I won't need it tomorrow. HOWEVER a scum flip of Aru would weaken some of the points I've made. My case against AV isn't exactly associative tells, and stands on his own, but AV's votes on Aru didn't feel like busing to me.<br><blockquote><div><cite>nhammen wrote:</cite>Really? Why did you not like that?<br></div></blockquote><br>Because it wasn't followed with any comments about him being hammered or any inquiry about if he killed scum or not. Someone who is pretending to hammer when not is obviously trying to get information, whereas AV simply looked like he had no idea where his vote was or where his previous suspicions were. Very scummy.<br><blockquote><div><cite>nhammen wrote:</cite>Hmmm... interesting. Are you intentionally buddying Pine?<br></div></blockquote><br>Not really. I've just got a lot of experience with the guy and I'm not currently convinced he's scum despite the fact that quite a few people do.<br><blockquote><div><cite>nhammen wrote:</cite>Umm yeah. That is exactly the reason he is claiming. He isn't claiming the logic is bad. He is claiming that you jumping on this without even indicating that you actually thought about it is extremely scummy. And it is kinda scummy.<br></div></blockquote><br>It wasn't a complicated point. AV just didn't like the fact that I disregarded his defense of it (simply because I hadn't investigated the point yet, why would I analyze the defense before analyzing the argument?) and insisted that should Aru flip town I'm going to take a good hard look at the timing of AV's vote. Explain how this is scummy.<br><blockquote><div><cite>nhammen wrote:</cite>To me, it looks like you are saying that AV was right when he said you didn't understand Michel's case.<br></div></blockquote><br>What? I'm simply stating that <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">I haven't examined Michel's point IN CONTEXT yet</span>. Just because I understand it doesn't mean I've actually gone back and took a close look at AV's vote and intentions and such yet, because as I've said repeatedly, it would be silly for me to actually do that without knowing Aru's alignment.<br><blockquote><div><cite>nhammen wrote:</cite>Ummm, you do realize you said these two things in the same post, right?<br></div></blockquote><br>As I've said earlier, a lot of the points I have against AV won't make a lot of sense if Aru flips goon (if Aru is a scum PR then obviously AV would have flipped a shit with the intent of protecting him, but I'll go in to that if that flip happens). If I don't feel like I have a strong case against AV tomorrow, then I won't vote him. It really is as simple as that.<br><blockquote><div><cite>nhammen wrote:</cite>Ummm, just had a thought. Do you agree that there are associative tells between yourself and Pine?<br></div></blockquote><br>Of course there are. I've defended Pine. If one of us flips scum that will certainly be enough grounds to go after the other. Should Pine flip scum, then I'll obviously have to argue that the points weren't indicative of same alignment, but honestly the stuff you're pushing on me is mostly moot because most of it relies on another person flipping to make sense. You can't push that shit without flips.<br><br>I'm going to take a closer look at Pine during night 1, maybe there's something I've missed. This many people being willing to push him this close to deadline means there are town players interested in his lynch. If anyone wants to vote him on the onset of day 2, it would be helpful if you included a comprehensive case as to why you find him scummy."}

He cites 2 reasons for thinking Arugula is scum. One is this comment from Michel:<br><blockquote><div><cite>Michel wrote:</cite>Arugula: I don't really understand #109. It seems to me that you did notice jee's vote (\"his recent quag vote seemed genuine\") but then forgot about it (\"but he didn't vote him\").<br></div></blockquote><br>and disliking Arugula's (somewhat of a lack of) response to AV's comment in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4095194#p4095194\" class=\"postlink\">post 102</a>. If all of this was done on page 5, then great. That's sufficient reasoning to merit some pressure at that stage in the game by any reasonable person's standards.<br><br>AV gives significantly better reasons to vote for pecan than he does for voting Arugula. However, despite the fact that he's only caught up to page 6 (and saw the votes on page 10) he votes Arugula. As Michel pointed out, this vote is really weird. Why vote despite not being caught up? Especially for outdated reasons? The timing for AV's vote was right when the Arugula wagon was starting to pick up steam (as I myself had switched over). I don't believe this was a coincidence.<br><br>AV \"confirms\" his suspicions of Arugula based on actions of page 9. Yet he's already voted. AV even praises my vote at this point in time.<br><br>Then Michel makes his observation, and I say this:<br><blockquote><div><cite>ICEninja wrote:</cite>I'm going to check this in context during N1. If this wagon is indeed on a townie, and this points true, then I know where my radar will lead me to at the start of day 2.<br></div></blockquote><br>It checks true. Here's the thing, though, AV knew all of this. AV knew that the wagon was on a townie, and that the lynching of Arugula was going to damn him.<br><br>AV's defense in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4117938#p4117938\" class=\"postlink\">post 274</a> is noteworthy, as he does the best he can to explain why Arugula was scummier than PoPP as of page 5, but his points are definitely stretching it, and a lot of his reasoning is simply stating what Arugula said, and calling it scumposting. His earlier points against PoPP were stronger than that.<br><br>On page 12, he simply flips out. He made up bullshit about me supposedly not understanding Michel's point. If you look at the <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4118639#p4118639\" class=\"postlink\">post where he votes me</a>, he really doesn't have much reasoning AT ALL to substantiate anything he's saying. Yet he's pushed, actually quite hard, for an Arugula lynch, even saying he supports a hammer. Yet simply because people come in and say if Arugula flips town, he's going to get scum points, he COMPLETELY reverses his read on Arugula from confident that he's scum to confirmed town (LOL only scum knows someone is confirmed as town on day 1).<br><br>I could go on and show examples of how he over reacts, makes ridiculously reaching assumptions, and does whatever he can to prevent that Arugula lynch that, if AV is scum and knows Arugula is town, certainly points to his own doom, but everyone saw it. Quite a few players commented on it and agreed that he was behaving oddly. If anyone really needs me to point out what I'm talking about here I can, but you should be able to very easily find it on your own.<br><br>AV actively tried to divide the town even further, pushing for a 3rd counterwagon so close to deadline.<br><br>Even if we didn't lynch Arugula and had him flip town, AV's reactions were simply so extreme and polar opposite to his earlier suspicions and statements, and they were reversed for the purpose of self preservation. This is scum motivation to the max.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote AurorusVox</span>.

By switching, ICE guaranteed a lynch. If he had kept pushing at AV hard, not only is it unlikely he could have convinced enough players for an AV lynch in the short amount of time he had, but he would also have run the risk of reducing the Arugula wagon to the extend that we would end up with no lynch at all.

Vote me if you want, but you still really have zero reasons for actually accusing me of scum.

My observations of 1080 (I had a real-life friend playing in the game, so I read it as it was happening) suggest to me that Brundibar is not that twitchy or reactive when playing Town. His earlier bad reaction to suspicion piqued my interest, so I set this up to see how he'd react to being voted sans explanation. OMGUS and opportunity out of someone who appears to normally not do so = scum.<br></div></blockquote><br><br>I fixed the quotes to make his retarded argument more easily recognizable.  First of all, it's entirely based upon meta...which is okay I guess, except as Michel pointed out, brundibar can just as easily be found reacting as town the way he reacted in this game, rendering Pine\u2019s conclusion that he\u2019s scum this game completely invalid.  Also he makes mention of an \u201cearlier bad reaction to suspicion that piqued his interest\u201d but doesn\u2019t elaborate on what it was or how it\u2019s relevant to his little gambit.  This is a blatant case of trying to build a case out of nothing.   <br><br>Next, we have his nhammen, which can be seen here.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4096671#p4096671\" class=\"postlink\">post 120</a>, Pine wrote:</cite>I really dislike the resistance to Brundibar. It feels like the counter-push was engineered, and that suggests that there might be a scumteam or individual player that's playing pretty heavy-handed.<br><br>Thinking it might be nhammen. He's twice now jumped onto the path of least resistance. First with jee, who seemed like he was going to be the early wagon that garnered a lot of suspicion, and then onto me in the middle of it. That seems very much like the tactics I've seen him use when we were scum together.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Unvote<br>Vote: nhammen</span></div></blockquote><br><br>Now, as far as I can see, up to this point in the game (post 120), nhammen is playing a particularly open and honest game.  He's very clear in with his intentions and isn't afraid to draw attention to himself.  Furthermore, he\u2019s had suspicion on him to this point (Michel didn\u2019t like his questions and voted for him) and rather than completely ignore Michel, he answered Michel\u2019s suspicions.  Please notice that this did not prevent him from scumhunting, this is important, because Pine would have you believe that as a townie, it\u2019s actually ANTI-TOWN to answer for suspicions people have, because it prevents you from scumhunting.  I find this logic to be inherently flawed, because I\u2019ve found that establishing your own innocence is VASTLY important to town\u2019s success as a townie.<br><br>Also, I don\u2019t understand how voting for jee was a \u201cpath of least resistance\u201d.  He took the time to explain his reasoning for the vote, and he was the first on the wagon...I don\u2019t see what he\u2019s even talking about when he says that jee is \u201can easy wagon\u201d.  This is all just talk, it\u2019s designed to look like he actually analyzed the situation and is coming to a conclusion, but the conclusion doesn\u2019t make sense with the (limited) info he provides.  For someone touting their own accomplishments on this site, I expect more.<br><br>Oh, and these two posts (found back to back in isolation) were hilarious, particularly the bolded.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4105427#p4105427\" class=\"postlink\">post 172</a>, Pine wrote:</cite>Also, I don't give two piles of day old shit how I appear, <span class=\"noboldsig\">as evidenced by my continued habit of telling my accusers to fuck off and ignoring their asinine questions. </span>I've remained focused on hunting scum, which thus far looks to be you and nhammen, and maybe still brundibar.</div></blockquote><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4105613#p4105613\" class=\"postlink\">post 176</a>, Pine wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4105495#p4105495\" class=\"postlink\">post 173</a>, Arugula wrote:</cite>Oh, so now you are accusing anyone who finds a fault in you?

I haven't done anything to encourage the suspicion of me</span>, and quite frankly, I have found in the past as Town that whenever I try too hard to fight inaccurate suspicion of me, it only deepens it. The only solution is to redouble my efforts. This serves three purposes. First, it is useful for the standard Town wincon. Second, it lets me get all of my opinions, perspectives, and ideas out there, so that when I get confirmed by flip, they are vindicated and can be used as a resource by other Townies, and third, honest effort at scumhunting is the Towniest thing one can do.<br><br>So again, fuck off all of you.

However, what is he doing in the second quote?  Answering an asinine question!  That question was asinine!  \u201cHow does it help us generally if we think you\u2019re scum\u201d  Obviously if he\u2019s town the answer is \u201cit doesn\u2019t\u201d, and because EVERYONE in town will tell you that they\u2019re town, one can assume that the answer is going to be \u201cit doesn\u2019t.\u201d  Yet this is one of the questions that Pine has no problem going into detail answering.  You know what else he answered?  nhammen\u2019s asinine meta-questions.  However, he can\u2019t be arsed to respond to accusations against him.  Those questions are \u2018asinine\u2019 and \u2018prevent him from scumhunting\u2019.<br><br>I\u2019m calling BS.  Don\u2019t worry town, I won\u2019t let the bad man lie to you anymore."}

Connections. I recommend following along via isos.<br><br>From Pine's posts we have post 401 vs. 446. According to 401, Pine thought Ice was town. But by 446 all of a sudden he thinks he's (by now VE) scum. Given that Pine was about to die, I think that this was his last ditch attempt to distance himself from ICE/VE. VE had by now similarly begun to distance himself, and I think Pine caught on.<br><br>ICEninja posted more, so this analysis is a bit more detailed. I will divide it into two parts: individual scum tells, and Pine connection scum tells.<br><br>Individual:<br>Firstly, in post 30 Ice declares himself \"the easiest player to read on the site\" because he's supposedly a bad scum player. That's straight-up manipulation of meta for his own benefit. <br>In post 40 Ice casts suspicion on Michel without much substance. Essentially, he wants to prevent solid town reads to develop -- keeps more mislynch options on the table. The main reason it is scummy is because it's so random and out of place.<br>In 232 Ice casually gets onto the Arugula wagon without contributing anything himself. This after he had just asked Michel if he would hammer Arugula (in 218), to which Michel said yes. That, in retrospect, looks definitively like scum fishing for support for a town wagon. Later, Ice sets up Aurorus for the next lynch. This makes up such a large portion of Ice's posts that I won't bother to reference every one of them, but if you want to start go to 270. Given that we now know that AV was town (and was very strongly in favor of a Pine-Ice scumteam) this is incredibly scummy. We can WIFOM waffle about how scum just want us to think that Ice would have done that, but let's not. The first, most straightforward aspect of WIFOM is just generally the most likely. Couple that with the fact that towns rarely attack people based off of the night kill (again, due to the WIFOM defense) I can see VE NKing AV. And if VE is scum, let's look at his other option: let AV live. If that happens, I can guarantee to you that AV would be jumping up and down calling for VE's lynch. From VE's perspective, it was probably better to take out AV and risk the attacks.<br><br>Towards Pine:<br>In post 62 Ice votes for Pine because of the whole brundibar/Pine gambit shenanigan. But by 119 that vote is gone, and the weak suspicion that was apparently there evaporates. Along the way, I kind of get the feeling that Ice is subtly coaching Pine. In post 62 he seems to mostly be voting to get Pine to explain himself. Post 65 is even worse. Ice specifically says \"it's not like town you [Pine].\" The unwritten, implied statement is \"be more like town you.\" As early as post 87 Ice is already weaseling himself out of his Pine vote, by basically saying that Pine is Pine. He does that again in posts 177 and 191.<br><br>296 is really damning. ICEninja says that he wants Pine around for a few nights since, \"There's a decent chance he'll either catch scum or clear a PR.\" First of all, there's the obvious Pine-preservation going on. Secondly, the reasoning is itself ridiculous. If Pine was scum (and he was) there was no way he was ever going to feed us even halfway decent information. Also, tracker is such a weak role that's it's difficult to catch scum and even more difficult to clear PRs (scum have PRs too...) Really, this is just Ice's attempt to keep an imperiled scum buddy around for as long as he can.<br>---<br>Finally, VisceraEyes has been trying to take credit for Pine's lynch. This is simply untrue. Pine had 3 votes before VE even posted in this game. He had another vote before VE posted his full case on Pine (the post where he didn't just quote acfan...) and that vote was from our DOUBLE VOTER. Additionally, brundibar had indicated that we was up for voting Pine too.<br><br>Pine was extremely scummy scum, and VE did not single-handedly catch him. Pine's lynch happened quickly and decisively via widespread consensus among the town. Don't let VE get the credit.<br><br>However, we shouldn't lynch VE <span style=\"font-style: italic\">too</span> quickly. I think everyone should weigh in on their scum reads, and in particular, what their stance is on lynching VE. <br><br>I hope this fairly in-depth analysis makes up somewhat for my absence from a good portion of this game."}

It's kind of a fun, \"gee, what will happen if I get to be almost lynched and have to save myself!?\" The adrenaline rush, right? So, what fakeclaim did you decide for this game? And, you admit here that it's common practice to not lynch claimed power roles. What you intentionally disregard is that it is BAD NEWS to lynch a power role <span style=\"font-style: italic\">in the first game day.</span> What if it's your only one? Then you're Mountainous -2 townies, and we know how that will end. <br><br>But hay, look! It's paragraph THREE. <br>it's absolutely brilliant. I'll quote it again: <br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4142009#p4142009\" class=\"postlink\">post 495</a>, VisceraEyes wrote:</cite>We ask for a pre-hammer claim, not so that we automatically don't lynch it - but so we have all the information the lynchee has before they die.  God, THAT is fucking Mafia 101 SV.  Clearly we can't just policy not lynch claimed power roles or scum would claim power roles every single game.</div></blockquote> <br>We ask for a pre-hammer claim on Day 1 because we don't want to hit a Power Role. Which, yes, encourages early scumcatches to claim Power Roles. Sometimes we lynch them anyway. Sometimes they are actually mafia. <br>Now, on Day TWO, you ask for a claim before lynch, to get information-- cop reports, doctor saves, whatever (and, if you believe the claim, why are you lynching the player?!), but sure, you get the information because <span style=\"font-style: italic\">there is some information</span>. <br>On Day 1, a Tracker has NO information. Neither does a cop, a doc, a jailkeeper, a bus driver, a gunsmith, a dreaming god-- you might get something out of a Mason, but that might be a BAD thing. And really, how are you going to get a lynch on a mason through on Day 1? Othermason(s) to the rescue! <br>And, yes, we can policy not-lynch claimed power roles (on day 1). And yes, it DOES encourage scum to think about PR claims-- which is something <span style=\"font-style: italic\">you say you do</span> when you get to play scum. <br>Nothing here about SV's play is out of the ordinary! You're just being stupid! Or... you know, trying to find scumminess where there isn't it. <br><br>Hay! I have more ranting to do, silly pony! You say, <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4140484#p4140484\" class=\"postlink\">\"rawr rawr, why didn't \"they\" kill the doublevoter instead of my nemesis!?\"</a> And then go on to attack him. WIFOM! <br>And another thing! why did you go through all of this... after all of us? We'd already all come to these conclusions. I mean, I suppose I can't be mad at your for re-reading (you were <span style=\"font-style: italic\">RE</span>-reading, right?) the thread, but someone had already said things like, \"gee, the Doublevoter is probably town!\" and \"gee, tracker and doublevoter is an unlikely combo!\" <br>Did you need to make seven QQ posts setting the scene for a weak accusation? <br><br><br>But here, you apparently know scum Pine really well. Right? <br>What was Scum Pine's motive for buddying with ICE? What was ICE's motive for buddying back?"}

Also says that Pines' laziness is anti-town and thus deserves a vote; which means of course that he knowingly and deliberately was acting anti-town himself.<br><br><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4110173#p4110173\" class=\"postlink\">Shows suspicion of multiple people but does not vote</a>.<br><br><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4139963#p4139963\" class=\"postlink\">After over a week, votes VE</a> which is very strange - he hops onto the easy vote while suddenly agreeing with the case on IceNinja.

Individual ICE section is full of stretching. Also his closing \"I think everyone should weigh in on their scum reads, and in particular, what their stance is on lynching VE.\" reads as fake concern to me. Of COURSE everyone is going to give their stance on lynching VE. But then if that's necessary, then why are you at all worried about a quicklynch on VE?<br><br>Overall hasn't commented on much and I really (even after reading his ISO just now) am unsure of his reads.</div></blockquote><br>I didn't vote Pine because I thought his laziness was scummy. I voted Pine to get him to answer the questions and to discourage laziness. It was a pressure vote, basically. I just didn't say that at the time because saying that your vote is for pressure completely defeats the purpose of it.<br><br>Yes, laziness is anti-town. Yes, I admit I am lazy about this game. It's not scummy though, for several reasons. One, what it actually indicates is disinterest. Two, I actually PREFER playing as Mafia. So if anything I should be less lazy in games where I'm scum. Three, in my recent games (check any of the recent non-marathon games linked to on my wiki page) I have been lazy in those too, regardless of alignment. I have been replaced in five games to date, and all of those were recent as well. The overriding trend from me has simply been increasing boredom. Unfortunate, since I'm sure it means the game is less enjoyable for everyone involved, not just me.<br><br>This also factors into some of the other points. When I'm less interested in a game, I put less effort into scumhunting. When I put less effort into scumhunting, I don't have as strong/good reads. When I don't have as strong/good reads, I tend not to vote. Hence the post where I expressed multiple suspicions but still didn't vote. All of those suspicions were weak.<br><br>As for the \"fakeness\" of my response to Michel's defense: As you say, Michel's defense was indeed formidable. So I'm sure you'll agree that my unvote was justified. However, from my perspective, his defense did not completely eliminate my suspicions. I still maintain that the word \"scumpotential\" is wishywashy sounding.<br><br>Finally, with regards to the VE/ICEninja case: What about the individual section is \"stretching\"? And your last question about the quicklynch is silly. Frankly, what I warned against did indeed come to pass, even if it wasn't in the way I imagined it. VE was quicklynched, courtesy of his selfhammer. Michel never got to weigh in solidly on his reads, and now he's dead so we'll never quite know. Your idea that my concern was false is laughable considering what actually happened.<br>---<br><br>I will agree that SV is confirmed town UNLESS we get into a situation where there absolutely cannot be two scum -- e.g. 4 person lylo with no scumlynches other than Pine. In that case SV is almost certainly scum. That's all rather unlikely, though.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Whiskers wrote:</cite>Alduskkel, you need fewer posts about how little you're posting.

Later, Ice sets up Aurorus for the next lynch. This makes up such a large portion of Ice's posts that I won't bother to reference every one of them, but if you want to start go to 270. Given that we now know that AV was town (and was very strongly in favor of a Pine-Ice scumteam) this is incredibly scummy.

Couple that with the fact that towns rarely attack people based off of the night kill (again, due to the WIFOM defense) I can see VE NKing AV. And if VE is scum, let's look at his other option: let AV live. If that happens, I can guarantee to you that AV would be jumping up and down calling for VE's lynch.

Essentially, he wants to prevent solid town reads to develop -- keeps more mislynch options on the table. The main reason it is scummy is because it's so random and out of place.<br>In 232 Ice casually gets onto the Arugula wagon without contributing anything himself. This after he had just asked Michel if he would hammer Arugula (in 218), to which Michel said yes. That, in retrospect, looks definitively like scum fishing for support for a town wagon. Later, Ice sets up Aurorus for the next lynch. This makes up such a large portion of Ice's posts that I won't bother to reference every one of them, but if you want to start go to 270. Given that we now know that AV was town (and was very strongly in favor of a Pine-Ice scumteam) this is incredibly scummy. We can WIFOM waffle about how scum just want us to think that Ice would have done that, but let's not. The first, most straightforward aspect of WIFOM is just generally the most likely. Couple that with the fact that towns rarely attack people based off of the night kill (again, due to the WIFOM defense) I can see VE NKing AV. And if VE is scum, let's look at his other option: let AV live. If that happens, I can guarantee to you that AV would be jumping up and down calling for VE's lynch.

And why does your explanation fit better?<br>2. It's not scummy if someone does something anti-town regardless of whether or not they're town or scum. If you want to press a lynch on me for lurking then that's a POLICY LYNCH.<br>3. Voting out of nowhere does not mean the read was not solid. In fact, I was pretty certain that VE was scum. But he wasn't, so I'm kind of lost.<br>4. Then we'll have to agree to disagree, because obviously we are interpreting the same statement differently.<br><br>Second points:<br>1. It's a point because manipulating your meta is something scum want to do, not town.<br>2. He does though. It's in the best interests of scum to avoid having people who are super townie looking, as Michel was. If no one in a game looks overwhelmingly pro-town, scum are in a great position. The only thing better would be if the scum were the only ones who looked overwhelmingly pro-town -- but that would probably be worthy of a Scummy award.<br>3. Getting on a wagon without adding anything is just bandwagoning. So ICE bandwagoned but he also did so after checking to see if he could get Michel's support -- which from my point of view then looked like scum trying to see just how much support he could get for a mislynch.<br>4. To some degree you are right. But getting AV lynched would benefit a scum ICEninja more than a normal mislynch -- it would also eliminate an attacker of his and Pine's. That's why it was a scumtell.<br>5&amp;6. I don't really see your problem with these points. It was clearly beneficial for ICEninja scum to NK Aurorus. I presented the two scenarios -- AV dying and AV not dying. The first was good for ICEninja/VE scum. The second was really bad, to the extent that I believed that VE/ICE scum would not want to go with this option even taking into account WIFOM.<br><br>And what's the problem with warning against a quicklynch? I was basically saying, \"Let's not cut off discussion.\" Discussion ended up being cut off. My warning was completely valid.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Junpei wrote:</cite>Addulsk: Do you think that mafia are very much more likely to be on a town wagon than town?</div></blockquote>No. Being wrong isn't scummy. What matters is how you get on a wagon. In general, pushing a wagon and creating a well-developed case is pro-town regardless of the alignment of the target. If the target is town, then it's still a townie thing to do because scum don't want to stick their heads out on a mislynch. You don't need me to explain why it's a pro-town action if the target is mafia.<br><br>On the other hand, it's scummy to suddenly get on a scum wagon at the last second. That reeks of bussing.<br><br>@CES: The way you defend me I wonder why the hell you're voting for me. Why don't you unvote, and maybe SV will also be convinced and we can NOT head to Day 5 lylo. In that case I will probably be replaced, but at least my replacement will not be in such a shitty situation.<br><br>@Salamence: Your case on me is two sentences. *buzzer* Try harder. Starting to think the brundibar/Salamence slot is scum. Salamence's current reads (and the lack of real substance to back them up) seems like scum getting ready to get on an easy mislynch (me), among other things.<br><br>@Everyone: Do ANY of you still think I was lurking as a STRATEGY? I'm getting replaced here. That's not in any way, shape, or form strategically advantageous.<br><br>If my lynch is inevitable (and it is unless I get two people to unvote or one person to unvote and SV changes his mind) then just lynch me soon before I get replaced because I would feel bad if some poor soul replaces into me, posts like 5 times TRYING to defend my actions, and then promptly gets hammered anyway. Then town loses in lylo or something and they have a town loss on their record out of no fault of their own.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">@Mod: You might want to inform potential replacements that they are in danger of being lynched almost immediately upon replacing in.

The last couple of post vis-a-vis Salamence defending on CES' behalf and CES taking that in his stride bring me back to answering the following question...<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4182992#p4182992\" class=\"postlink\">post 612</a>, Junpei wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>pieceofpecanpie wrote:</cite>I'd hate to open up the floor to speculation immediately, but Brundi/Salamence &amp; Cogito our long lost scum team?</div></blockquote><br>Is that a question or do you have a reason to believe this?</div></blockquote><br>Yes, it is a question in the sense that I want to responses from both you and Whiskers on it, and yes I have reasons to believe this.<br><br>I noted on the previous Day that CES was quite happy to defend Brundibar in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4159953#p4159953\" class=\"postlink\">Post 457</a> and again in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4161329#p4161329\" class=\"postlink\">Post 555</a>. Let's look at those two posts:<br><br><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4159953#p4159953\" class=\"postlink\">Post 547</a> is trivial, CES says <span style=\"font-style: italic\">Brundibar looks town to me.</span> In the same way you could say Brundibar looks like a kitten or a fireman, it has no rationale behind it that could come into question.<br><br><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4161329#p4161329\" class=\"postlink\">Post 555</a> contains two thoughts. Firstly he chooses to not expand on any thoughts for his vote on Alduskkel and the looming lynch. Why? Goodness knows, but it reeks. Secondly, a minor point made on why Brundi seems town, which to me seems damning not because of the point raised but what he chooses to ignore. Remember, this is well before Brundi replaced out, and so a pattern of lurking, weakly justified hammers, and a curious vote on Alduskkel the previous Day with no comment on the major bus (ICE/VE) all seem like things worth scrutinising and discussing. However, the pattern of getting some extensive thoughts from CES on Alduskkel seems continued with his lack of extensive thoughts on why Brundi seems town.<br><br>That Brundi remained absent in light of comments and questions towards him remains damning in itself. Even when taking into account that he replaced out afterwards, this doesn't account for my suspicions of his play in earlier Days. Here are two such moments where questions which I have asked Brundibar previously had been ignored:<br><br><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4133905#p4133905\" class=\"postlink\">Post #432</a><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Why are your votes doing all the talking when you, crucially, seem to keep reasons for doing so to yourself?<br><br>FoS @ Brundibar</div></blockquote><br><br><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4145135#p4145135\" class=\"postlink\">Post #498</a><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Brundibar, can you explain why you prefer Alduskkel over VE?</div></blockquote><br><br>Now I am at least grateful that Salamence has become active after replacing Brundibar. But this hasn't changed my suspicions, both due to the aforementioned defensiveness on CES' behalf and also in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4176220#p4176220\" class=\"postlink\">Post 602</a> the following is said, <span style=\"font-style: italic\">\"Cogito Ergo Sum<br><br>Faction: Null/town<br><br>Can't get a good read, but willing to trust him over the above two.</span>\"<br><br>Now where have I heard something like this before? Oh right, CES giving his opinion on the Brundibar/Salamence. They're both calling each other town, but can't really say why. I'm not buying it. Scum team ahoy if you ask me. As a small thought on the side CES saying that I <span style=\"font-style: italic\">just seem town</span> in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4185703#p4185703\" class=\"postlink\">Post 626</a> is nice to hear and all, but it again lacks any reasoning and justification and to me just seems like a statement made out of convenience rather than anything else.<br><br>Some thoughts on the other two:<br><br>Whiskers, I would love to hear something from you. I've got a town read on you for various reasons, however one of those is because of my deeper suspicious towards CES/Salamence, which doesn't exactly clear your name. Now is not the time for town to get flakey and remain silent.<br><br>Junpei is all town to me. His slot (ac) made an extremely early case on Pine's fakeclaim and was instrumental in bringing about the scum lynch. Since then Junpei has taken up the scumhunting torch and in my eyes has given a clear run of thoughts and questions to aid towns quest. I would like to add that although I believe the interest into whether I should be cleared or not was directed at CES, if you have something to to ask me Junpei you should do so. Are you holding back some thoughts of your own?"}

If someone flips scum, unless the scum team is extremely bussy, there will be scum on someone elses wagon. When AV flipped town, I was sitting in the dead thread begging for someone to notice this votecount because it means either pecan or Whiskers is scum, and I was leaning pecan anyways. Michel noticed it in his last post before VEyes quickhammered, and nobody remembered it."}

You were the last mafia and we had one ML left (5p). Everyone thought you were town or didn't suspect you. Then I replaced in and made a huge case on you (a wall of walls). You argued with me for pages of walls and eventually I let out and decided my suspicion on you wasn't strong after all.<br><br>Then, after gaining control of the whole town, you hammered on yourself on accident because you thought you were already voting yourself at L-1."}

Doublevoter has the advantage of being virtually confirmed, but SV's extreme lurky play made that rather a waste. Similary, Bodyguard is an excellent role to keep powerroles alive, but I hope I'm forgiven for saying that as one of the stronger players in the game, it wasn't ideal that I was the one receiving it. And losing the cop through nightkill night 1... unlucky, IMO. Town would probably have been far stronger with SV bodyguard, nhammen doublevoter and myself as cop.<br><br>I really hated the way VisceraEyes selfhammered as town. It's never good play, and definately not when other players request the time to write down their thoughts. As Nhammen mentioned PoPP and Whiskers should have been pressured far more for their day 2 play, but that got completely lost."}

I don't think I did a single pro-town thing this game except that one time I was suspicious of PoPP. Well played the scum team, Junpei was very town-looking and PoPP was under the radar. Pine, were all those post mortem mislynch setups intentional? If so then you were possibly the best scum player on the team, setting up two straight mislynches (more or less) after you're dead isn't easy."}

The distribution of who got what PR could have been better. SV's extreme lurking hurt town a lot.  I know from having had the role myself that double-voter can be extremely powerful for town, IF the player is active enough to make good use of it."}
