All other role information is secret, including how many players with a certain role exist and even if the role exists in the first place. <br>\n<br>\n2.\tTo vote for a player, bold the word \"vote\" followed by said player's name, e.g. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: Jackal711</div>. As long as I can tell to whom you are referring, spelling does not count and I will accept abbreviated or otherwise shortened forms of the name of the vote's recipient. If you change your mind about whom you want lynched, you must bold an unvote, preferably in the format <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Unvote: Jackal711</div>. You may also Vote: No Lynch, and Unvote: No Lynch.  Use of the vote and unvote tags is also allowed, and preferred.<br>\n<br>\n3.\tA majority of votes is required for a lynch, even at deadline. Once a lynch has been decided, it is final and further votes and unvotes do not count for the current day. If deadline is reached with no player having enough votes for a lynch, the day ends in an automatic No Lynch.<br>\n<br>\n4.\tOnce you're lynched, nightkilled, or modkilled (a modkill ends the day ONLY if the modkilled player is pro-town), I'll allow one \"bah\" post that doesn't contain any game-related content if you wish to make it, but you must thereafter stop posting in the game. Said \"bah\" post is the only post a dead player may make during twilight. Living players may continue to talk during twilight as long as they follow all of the rules. <br>\n<br>\n5.\tYou are not forced to like each other, but the fact that you badly want so and so offed does not give you the right to insult him or her. Please keep your hatred of people or groups thereof to yourself unless you want a warning. Three warnings (or an offensive enough post) and you will be ejected from the game and replaced with someone else.<br>\n<br>\n6.\tDo not hide text or otherwise hinder its readability by using spoiler tags, invisible text, etc. THIS INCLUDES ENCRYPTED TEXT! You may, however, post in any color that can be easily read against the forum background other than <div style=\"display:inline;color:blue\">blue</div>. This is my mod color. Violators will be warned. Doing it again will result in replacement.<br>\n<br>\n7.\tImpersonating the moderator WILL NOT HAPPEN. Doing so, you will be replaced.<br>\n<br>\n8.\tIf you somehow have the ability to edit or delete your posts in this forum, please DO NOT do so. If I catch you doing such, you will be replaced or modkilled.<br>\n<br>\n9.\tYou are not allowed to discuss this game outside of the thread unless I tell you otherwise, and then only with whom I have allowed you to do so and at your specified time. This is a modkillable offense.<br>\n<br>\n10.\tDiscussing an ongoing game in this game's thread gets you a warning the first time and a MODKILL the second time.<br>\n<br>\n11.\tDo not quote or pretend to quote any private communication, either from me or from anyone else you are allowed to talk with at night. This includes your role PM. Violators will be modkilled. You are allowed to paraphrase, but you are not allowed to plagiarize. If in doubt as to your paraphrase's legality, PM me with the wording you want to use.<br>\n<br>\n12.\tClaiming to be scum with someone else will result in a modkill.<br>\n<br>\n13.\tI will issue a prod to any player that does not post for 72 hours without notifying me of his or her absence. If you are prodded, you will have 48 hours from the time of submission to post in thread. Failure to do so may result in replacement. I will only prod the same player twice. If a third prod is required, they will be replaced.<br>\n<br>\n14.\tI am not God (or a Lawyer). I am only human and prone to making mistakes like any of us. If I do make a mistake please bring it to my attention either via PM or in thread. If addressing me in thread please do so in bold <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">@Mod: (message)</div><br>\n<br>\n15.\tAll rules are subject to change. If there are changes I will point them out in the next posted vote count.<br>\n<br>\n16.\tAll lynches and actions are considered to be done instantly. Obviously I can't be on all the time, so they will be posted as soon as possible. Night actions are considered to all happen at the same time. The principles of NAR (Natural Action Resolution) as discussed in the <a href=\"https://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Natural_Action_Resolution\" class=\"postlink\">Wiki</a> will apply in any conflict.<br>\n<br>\n17.\tDeadlines will be 2 weeks for Days, and 48 hours for Night.<br>\n<br>\n18.\tIf anyone gets modkilled, they will turn into a Neutral Survivor for all purposes and will lose the game. Day will also end immediately if they were town-aligned.<br>\n<br>\n19.    The most important rule of all, saved for last for what I think is a very good reason: HAVE FUN! Enjoy!

And when I originally posted this, I thought we would get two pieces of information from it: the players meta, and how they want to manipulate their meta. But that is patently stupid, because to check how they are manipulating it, we have to check against their entire history, which would take faaar too long.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#0000BF\">3 - </div>I'm not sure what you are saying. Are you saying that people will generally have the same criteria for their definition of good play and bad play regardless of alignment?

Thinking back on it, I believe my usual tactic was to wagon someone, but I had seen that only after writing up these questions, and so I wanted to see how well this did. It didn't pull us out of RVS in the way I had intended, but it did pull us out of RVS because multiple people have seen scumtells in it. So it did the job, but not the way I thought it would.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#0000BF\">6 - </div>Fair enough. I can understand not wanting to waste time with this.

From brundi's past play, it was fairly likely that he would vote Pine, and Pine could have realized this and been using his \"reaction test\" intentionally. But it is only slightly more likely, because he does do gambits as Town, and there is little reason to go after brundi, other than him being easy to manipulate in this manner.

First off, for a while there, AV was focusing exclusively on you, which was bad, but his post #100 fixed that. He still finds you scummy, for his initial reasoning, which I don't agree with. But it is most likely bad play, which is a nulltell. The claim is that there was enough information at the time that you made your random vote that you shouldn't have been making a random vote, but should have instead commented on the existing information. I disagree with this, because different people have different thoughts on what amount of information is necessary to comment on something, so it is just indicative of differing playstyles. I don't want to make the same mistake that AV made, but I think that at this point you should be able to have something more than just a random vote where \"there isn't any substance\".

Night kills always land on town, where lynches don't. Anti-town players (Pine isn't ALWAYS anti-town, but he is pretty much always conceited and somewhat rude, which often gets mistaken for anti-town or even scummy) and is virtually always a lynch possibility, but rarely the first pick for a lynch, so he ends up surviving to late game all the time.

Scum will night kill him, which is fine because that means our strong pro-town players will survive to day 2.<br>\n<br>\nThat being said, I believe Pine would indeed be a pretty good judge of Nhammen's scum meta, so I think there is a very high likelihood of one scum between the two.<br>\n<br>\nActually to be honest I'm not comfortable with this day ending yet anyway.

So this is severely out of character. <blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4107244#p4107244\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4107244#p4107244\" data-post-id=\"4107244\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 198</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=12670\">ICEninja</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Michel wrote:</cite><br>\n@ICE: you mean that pine regulary takes anti-town actions?

Night kills always land on town, where lynches don't. Anti-town players (Pine isn't ALWAYS anti-town, but he is pretty much always conceited and somewhat rude, which often gets mistaken for anti-town or even scummy) and is virtually always a lynch possibility, but rarely the first pick for a lynch, so he ends up surviving to late game all the time. No offense to Pine at all, I've gotten used to playing with him (the first couple times were not very enjoyable but I get him now) and I'm not really convinced he's scum here.<br>\n<br>\nEspecially with the tracker claim, I don't want to see Pine lynched today. Scum will night kill him, which is fine because that means our strong pro-town players will survive to day 2. </div></blockquote>What? WHAAAAAT!? <br>\nNo. Scum will NOT nightkill him, because he's irritating and decidedly anti-town. Scum <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">will not</div> night kill him, because he distracts all other players and is a really, really good scapegoat. Scum will kill their own buddies before they kill Pine, because Pine actively prevents scumcatching from getting done. <br>\nthis is, of course, only when Pine is not scum. Then, Pine doesn't get Nightkilled because he's scum. Pine survives until the end of the game.<br>\n<br>\nSee, but Pine doesn't get lynched because he can always worm his way out of it. For some reason, we're always hesitant to lynch Pine. Look, even now, he makes a claim of a weak investigative role. It's not unbelievable, there's little chance he'll be counter-claimed, and there's little chance (since it's such a weak role) that he'll even draw the nigthkill for it. This is a perfect survival claim. You know who <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">depends</div> on survival to win? Well, yeah, an SK. But it's more important for the two or three mafia to survive as long as possible, than it is for the town to. Pine survives until the end of the game. <br>\n<br>\nPine is Pine is Pine. There's no telling his alignment, and in my personal opinion, it's best to lynch him early, when the information is the most vague and the townies are the most willing to put through a meaningless vote. Because you can't lynch him later on. You just can't. It can't be done. You can't do it. Try it. You Can't. Pine survives until the end of the game. <br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4108172#p4108172\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4108172#p4108172\" data-post-id=\"4108172\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 212</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=12670\">ICEninja</a> wrote:</cite>I'm not 100% caught up but I just wanted to make a comment that in my entire game history, I have never seen town have 2 of the same role except under circumstance of JOAT, and even then it's extremely rare for a town JOAT to share a role with another town PR.</div></blockquote><br>\nMayo Clinic Open game. <br>\nCase closed.", "time": "Wed Jun 13, 2012 4:37 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=22206&start=275", "forum": "53", "thread": "22206"}

He's the player most likely to be scum right now, but there's no traction for a wagon on him and I don't want to divide town further than it has been between 4 lynch candidates (Arugula, Pine, AV, and myself) as that would simply muddy the waters and make finding scum later in the game much more difficult.<br>\n<br>\nDon't worry, either I'm going to have a strong case against AV tomorrow or I won't vote him.

The first is that doing such an evaluation will have too strong an influence on the townplayers. When we know what Arugula flipped, everyone should go back to see what they learned. If someone posts an evaluation now, it's far too easy for other townies to simply read that evaluation rather then think for themselves.<br>\n<br>\nThe other is that such a complete evaluation gives mafia far too much information. They'll know exactly where suspicions will be going and why. They'll know what they'll have to defend against, they'll know who they have to nightkill. It's far more difficult for them if they can't be entirely sure what to expect from day 2.<br>\n<br>\nThe third downside to doing an evaluation now is that you can't be as focussed when doing it. When you know what the flip was, you can look at the entire thread through that lens. When you don't know the flip, you'll continuously have \"but what if he flips otherwise?\" in the back of your mind, weakening the strength of your observations.<br>\n<br>\nThese three downsides together make up for the risk of getting nightkilled before you can do the analysis, IMO.<br>\n<br>\n@whiskers: ICE not attacking AV right now is good for town. we'll need to get a lynch together. 2 votes for both pine and ICE, 0 for AV, 6 for Arugula.

If I pushed it, (and it seems like others would be willing to listen to me right now) town would be divided 4 ways, with deadline tomorrow. Doing this would help scum more than us, as it would force too many people to settle on a lynch instead of get the one they want, and scum will pretty much be able to talk their way out of any day 1 VCA.<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Whiskers wrote:</cite><br>\nHm, with your \"substantial case,\" do you really need an Aru townflip to attack AVox?<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\nA town flip of Aru makes my already substantial case stronger. I did not need an Aru flip to vote AV earlier today, and I won't need it tomorrow. HOWEVER a scum flip of Aru would weaken some of the points I've made. My case against AV isn't exactly associative tells, and stands on his own, but AV's votes on Aru didn't feel like busing to me.<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>nhammen wrote:</cite><br>\nReally? Why did you not like that?<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\nBecause it wasn't followed with any comments about him being hammered or any inquiry about if he killed scum or not. Someone who is pretending to hammer when not is obviously trying to get information, whereas AV simply looked like he had no idea where his vote was or where his previous suspicions were. Very scummy.<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>nhammen wrote:</cite><br>\nHmmm... interesting. Are you intentionally buddying Pine?<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\nNot really. I've just got a lot of experience with the guy and I'm not currently convinced he's scum despite the fact that quite a few people do.<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>nhammen wrote:</cite><br>\nUmm yeah. That is exactly the reason he is claiming. He isn't claiming the logic is bad. He is claiming that you jumping on this without even indicating that you actually thought about it is extremely scummy. And it is kinda scummy.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\nIt wasn't a complicated point. AV just didn't like the fact that I disregarded his defense of it (simply because I hadn't investigated the point yet, why would I analyze the defense before analyzing the argument?) and insisted that should Aru flip town I'm going to take a good hard look at the timing of AV's vote.

I'm simply stating that <div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">I haven't examined Michel's point IN CONTEXT yet</div>. Just because I understand it doesn't mean I've actually gone back and took a close look at AV's vote and intentions and such yet, because as I've said repeatedly, it would be silly for me to actually do that without knowing Aru's alignment.<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>nhammen wrote:</cite><br>\nUmmm, you do realize you said these two things in the same post, right?<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\nAs I've said earlier, a lot of the points I have against AV won't make a lot of sense if Aru flips goon (if Aru is a scum PR then obviously AV would have flipped a shit with the intent of protecting him, but I'll go in to that if that flip happens). If I don't feel like I have a strong case against AV tomorrow, then I won't vote him. It really is as simple as that.<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>nhammen wrote:</cite><br>\nUmmm, just had a thought. Do you agree that there are associative tells between yourself and Pine?<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\nOf course there are. I've defended Pine. If one of us flips scum that will certainly be enough grounds to go after the other. Should Pine flip scum, then I'll obviously have to argue that the points weren't indicative of same alignment, but honestly the stuff you're pushing on me is mostly moot because most of it relies on another person flipping to make sense. You can't push that shit without flips.<br>\n<br>\nI'm going to take a closer look at Pine during night 1, maybe there's something I've missed. This many people being willing to push him this close to deadline means there are town players interested in his lynch.

There was Arugula. And who? Pine? That wagon dissipated after he claimed Tracker. You, with all of 2 votes (bit jumpy, aren't you?)?

If you were town you'd want to do the legwork to find out if I was scum as MS' argument initially suggested. AT THAT POINT you had no \"deadline\" concerns to make you save it for N1. You could have been killed off. You could have prevented an Argugula mislynch. If he flips town you look to see if I'm voting with scum-motivations. If he flips scum you look to see if I was bussing. The fact that you claim my vote didn't look like a bus (in this very post) PROVES that you're lying about not wanting to look for associations in relation to the vote before the flip. The fact that you VOTED me also proves it.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>If I don't feel like I have a strong case against AV tomorrow, then I won't vote him.

He cites 2 reasons for thinking Arugula is scum. One is this comment from Michel:<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Michel wrote:</cite><br>\nArugula: I don't really understand #109. It seems to me that you did notice jee's vote (\"his recent quag vote seemed genuine\") but then forgot about it (\"but he didn't vote him\").<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\nand disliking Arugula's (somewhat of a lack of) response to AV's comment in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4095194#p4095194\" class=\"postlink\">post 102</a>. If all of this was done on page 5, then great. That's sufficient reasoning to merit some pressure at that stage in the game by any reasonable person's standards.<br>\n<br>\nAV gives significantly better reasons to vote for pecan than he does for voting Arugula. However, despite the fact that he's only caught up to page 6 (and saw the votes on page 10) he votes Arugula. As Michel pointed out, this vote is really weird. Why vote despite not being caught up? Especially for outdated reasons? The timing for AV's vote was right when the Arugula wagon was starting to pick up steam (as I myself had switched over). I don't believe this was a coincidence.<br>\n<br>\nAV \"confirms\" his suspicions of Arugula based on actions of page 9. Yet he's already voted. AV even praises my vote at this point in time.<br>\n<br>\nThen Michel makes his observation, and I say this:<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>ICEninja wrote:</cite><br>\nI'm going to check this in context during N1. If this wagon is indeed on a townie, and this points true, then I know where my radar will lead me to at the start of day 2.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\nIt checks true. Here's the thing, though, AV knew all of this. AV knew that the wagon was on a townie, and that the lynching of Arugula was going to damn him.<br>\n<br>\nAV's defense in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4117938#p4117938\" class=\"postlink\">post 274</a> is noteworthy, as he does the best he can to explain why Arugula was scummier than PoPP as of page 5, but his points are definitely stretching it, and a lot of his reasoning is simply stating what Arugula said, and calling it scumposting. His earlier points against PoPP were stronger than that.<br>\n<br>\nOn page 12, he simply flips out. He made up bullshit about me supposedly not understanding Michel's point. If you look at the <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4118639#p4118639\" class=\"postlink\">post where he votes me</a>, he really doesn't have much reasoning AT ALL to substantiate anything he's saying. Yet he's pushed, actually quite hard, for an Arugula lynch, even saying he supports a hammer. Yet simply because people come in and say if Arugula flips town, he's going to get scum points, he COMPLETELY reverses his read on Arugula from confident that he's scum to confirmed town (LOL only scum knows someone is confirmed as town on day 1).<br>\n<br>\nI could go on and show examples of how he over reacts, makes ridiculously reaching assumptions, and does whatever he can to prevent that Arugula lynch that, if AV is scum and knows Arugula is town, certainly points to his own doom, but everyone saw it. Quite a few players commented on it and agreed that he was behaving oddly. If anyone really needs me to point out what I'm talking about here I can, but you should be able to very easily find it on your own.<br>\n<br>\nAV actively tried to divide the town even further, pushing for a 3rd counterwagon so close to deadline.<br>\n<br>\nEven if we didn't lynch Arugula and had him flip town, AV's reactions were simply so extreme and polar opposite to his earlier suspicions and statements, and they were reversed for the purpose of self preservation.

If there was no majority, we would have no lynched, which would be extremely bad for town. If you felt Arugula was town, why didn't you make any attempt whatsoever to form a counterwagon? By switching, ICE guaranteed a lynch. If he had kept pushing at AV hard, not only is it unlikely he could have convinced enough players for an AV lynch in the short amount of time he had, but he would also have run the risk of reducing the Arugula wagon to the extend that we would end up with no lynch at all. That's also something ICE has explained before. And that is good reasoning. <br>\n<br>\nI agree that ICE is suspicious, but you seem to be mindlessly tunneling.

First of all, it's entirely based upon meta...which is okay I guess, except as Michel pointed out, brundibar can just as easily be found reacting as town the way he reacted in this game, rendering Pine&#8217;s conclusion that he&#8217;s scum this game completely invalid.  Also he makes mention of an &#8220;earlier bad reaction to suspicion that piqued his interest&#8221; but doesn&#8217;t elaborate on what it was or how it&#8217;s relevant to his little gambit.

Please notice that this did not prevent him from scumhunting, this is important, because Pine would have you believe that as a townie, it&#8217;s actually ANTI-TOWN to answer for suspicions people have, because it prevents you from scumhunting.

{"number": 476, "id": "4140246", "user": "Alduskkel", "user_id": "10070", "content": "So! Connections. I recommend following along via isos.<br>\n<br>\nFrom Pine's posts we have post 401 vs. 446. According to 401, Pine thought Ice was town. But by 446 all of a sudden he thinks he's (by now VE) scum. Given that Pine was about to die, I think that this was his last ditch attempt to distance himself from ICE/VE. VE had by now similarly begun to distance himself, and I think Pine caught on.<br>\n<br>\nICEninja posted more, so this analysis is a bit more detailed. I will divide it into two parts: individual scum tells, and Pine connection scum tells.<br>\n<br>\nIndividual:<br>\nFirstly, in post 30 Ice declares himself \"the easiest player to read on the site\" because he's supposedly a bad scum player. That's straight-up manipulation of meta for his own benefit. <br>\nIn post 40 Ice casts suspicion on Michel without much substance. Essentially, he wants to prevent solid town reads to develop -- keeps more mislynch options on the table. The main reason it is scummy is because it's so random and out of place.<br>\nIn 232 Ice casually gets onto the Arugula wagon without contributing anything himself. This after he had just asked Michel if he would hammer Arugula (in 218), to which Michel said yes. That, in retrospect, looks definitively like scum fishing for support for a town wagon. Later, Ice sets up Aurorus for the next lynch. This makes up such a large portion of Ice's posts that I won't bother to reference every one of them, but if you want to start go to 270. Given that we now know that AV was town (and was very strongly in favor of a Pine-Ice scumteam) this is incredibly scummy. We can WIFOM waffle about how scum just want us to think that Ice would have done that, but let's not. The first, most straightforward aspect of WIFOM is just generally the most likely. Couple that with the fact that towns rarely attack people based off of the night kill (again, due to the WIFOM defense) I can see VE NKing AV. And if VE is scum, let's look at his other option: let AV live. If that happens, I can guarantee to you that AV would be jumping up and down calling for VE's lynch. From VE's perspective, it was probably better to take out AV and risk the attacks.<br>\n<br>\nTowards Pine:<br>\nIn post 62 Ice votes for Pine because of the whole brundibar/Pine gambit shenanigan. But by 119 that vote is gone, and the weak suspicion that was apparently there evaporates. Along the way, I kind of get the feeling that Ice is subtly coaching Pine. In post 62 he seems to mostly be voting to get Pine to explain himself. Post 65 is even worse. Ice specifically says \"it's not like town you [Pine].\" The unwritten, implied statement is \"be more like town you.\" As early as post 87 Ice is already weaseling himself out of his Pine vote, by basically saying that Pine is Pine. He does that again in posts 177 and 191.<br>\n<br>\n296 is really damning. ICEninja says that he wants Pine around for a few nights since, \"There's a decent chance he'll either catch scum or clear a PR.\" First of all, there's the obvious Pine-preservation going on. Secondly, the reasoning is itself ridiculous. If Pine was scum (and he was) there was no way he was ever going to feed us even halfway decent information. Also, tracker is such a weak role that's it's difficult to catch scum and even more difficult to clear PRs (scum have PRs too...) Really, this is just Ice's attempt to keep an imperiled scum buddy around for as long as he can.<br>\n---<br>\nFinally, VisceraEyes has been trying to take credit for Pine's lynch. This is simply untrue. Pine had 3 votes before VE even posted in this game. He had another vote before VE posted his full case on Pine (the post where he didn't just quote acfan...) and that vote was from our DOUBLE VOTER. Additionally, brundibar had indicated that we was up for voting Pine too.<br>\n<br>\nPine was extremely scummy scum, and VE did not single-handedly catch him. Pine's lynch happened quickly and decisively via widespread consensus among the town. Don't let VE get the credit.<br>\n<br>\nHowever, we shouldn't lynch VE <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">too</div> quickly. I think everyone should weigh in on their scum reads, and in particular, what their stance is on lynching VE. <br>\n<br>\nI hope this fairly in-depth analysis makes up somewhat for my absence from a good portion of this game.", "time": "Fri Jun 22, 2012 4:40 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=22206&start=475", "forum": "53", "thread": "22206"}

Also says that Pines' laziness is anti-town and thus deserves a vote; which means of course that he knowingly and deliberately was acting anti-town himself.<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4110173#p4110173\" class=\"postlink\">Shows suspicion of multiple people but does not vote</a>.<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4139963#p4139963\" class=\"postlink\">After over a week, votes VE</a> which is very strange - he hops onto the easy vote while suddenly agreeing with the case on IceNinja.

Individual ICE section is full of stretching. Also his closing \"I think everyone should weigh in on their scum reads, and in particular, what their stance is on lynching VE.\" reads as fake concern to me. Of COURSE everyone is going to give their stance on lynching VE. But then if that's necessary, then why are you at all worried about a quicklynch on VE?<br>\n<br>\nOverall hasn't commented on much and I really (even after reading his ISO just now) am unsure of his reads.</div></blockquote><br>\nI didn't vote Pine because I thought his laziness was scummy. I voted Pine to get him to answer the questions and to discourage laziness. It was a pressure vote, basically. I just didn't say that at the time because saying that your vote is for pressure completely defeats the purpose of it.<br>\n<br>\nYes, laziness is anti-town. Yes, I admit I am lazy about this game. It's not scummy though, for several reasons. One, what it actually indicates is disinterest. Two, I actually PREFER playing as Mafia. So if anything I should be less lazy in games where I'm scum. Three, in my recent games (check any of the recent non-marathon games linked to on my wiki page) I have been lazy in those too, regardless of alignment. I have been replaced in five games to date, and all of those were recent as well. The overriding trend from me has simply been increasing boredom. Unfortunate, since I'm sure it means the game is less enjoyable for everyone involved, not just me.<br>\n<br>\nThis also factors into some of the other points. When I'm less interested in a game, I put less effort into scumhunting. When I put less effort into scumhunting, I don't have as strong/good reads. When I don't have as strong/good reads, I tend not to vote. Hence the post where I expressed multiple suspicions but still didn't vote. All of those suspicions were weak.<br>\n<br>\nAs for the \"fakeness\" of my response to Michel's defense: As you say, Michel's defense was indeed formidable. So I'm sure you'll agree that my unvote was justified. However, from my perspective, his defense did not completely eliminate my suspicions. I still maintain that the word \"scumpotential\" is wishywashy sounding.<br>\n<br>\nFinally, with regards to the VE/ICEninja case: What about the individual section is \"stretching\"? And your last question about the quicklynch is silly. Frankly, what I warned against did indeed come to pass, even if it wasn't in the way I imagined it. VE was quicklynched, courtesy of his selfhammer. Michel never got to weigh in solidly on his reads, and now he's dead so we'll never quite know. Your idea that my concern was false is laughable considering what actually happened.<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\nI will agree that SV is confirmed town UNLESS we get into a situation where there absolutely cannot be two scum -- e.g. 4 person lylo with no scumlynches other than Pine. In that case SV is almost certainly scum. That's all rather unlikely, though.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Whiskers wrote:</cite>Alduskkel, you need fewer posts about how little you're posting.

That's straight-up manipulation of meta for his own benefit. <br>\nIn post 40 Ice casts suspicion on Michel without much substance. Essentially, he wants to prevent solid town reads to develop -- keeps more mislynch options on the table. The main reason it is scummy is because it's so random and out of place.<br>\nIn 232 Ice casually gets onto the Arugula wagon without contributing anything himself. This after he had just asked Michel if he would hammer Arugula (in 218), to which Michel said yes. That, in retrospect, looks definitively like scum fishing for support for a town wagon. Later, Ice sets up Aurorus for the next lynch. This makes up such a large portion of Ice's posts that I won't bother to reference every one of them, but if you want to start go to 270. Given that we now know that AV was town (and was very strongly in favor of a Pine-Ice scumteam) this is incredibly scummy. We can WIFOM waffle about how scum just want us to think that Ice would have done that, but let's not. The first, most straightforward aspect of WIFOM is just generally the most likely. Couple that with the fact that towns rarely attack people based off of the night kill (again, due to the WIFOM defense) I can see VE NKing AV. And if VE is scum, let's look at his other option: let AV live. If that happens, I can guarantee to you that AV would be jumping up and down calling for VE's lynch. From VE's perspective, it was probably better to take out AV and risk the attacks.</div></blockquote><br>\n1) How is this a point?<br>\n<br>\n2) He hardly <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4090343#p4090343\" class=\"postlink\">cast suspicion on Michel</a>. <br>\n<br>\n3) I don't understand your ICE/Arugula wagon point, it could be valid, I'm not sure.<br>\n<br>\n4) You are saying ICE is scum because he campaigned for a lynch of a townie which a pure post hoc fallacy.<br>\n<br>\n5) Telling us to not think about it and just accept it wasn't WIFOM.<br>\n<br>\n6) You then go on to WIFOM to make another point.<br>\n<br>\nFinally, your excuse for cautioning against a quicklynch is just post hoc reasoning and thus invalid for justifying a mindset at a given time.</div></blockquote><br>\nFirst points:<br>\n1. And why does your explanation fit better?<br>\n2. It's not scummy if someone does something anti-town regardless of whether or not they're town or scum. If you want to press a lynch on me for lurking then that's a POLICY LYNCH.<br>\n3. Voting out of nowhere does not mean the read was not solid. In fact, I was pretty certain that VE was scum. But he wasn't, so I'm kind of lost.<br>\n4. Then we'll have to agree to disagree, because obviously we are interpreting the same statement differently.<br>\n<br>\nSecond points:<br>\n1. It's a point because manipulating your meta is something scum want to do, not town.<br>\n2. He does though. It's in the best interests of scum to avoid having people who are super townie looking, as Michel was. If no one in a game looks overwhelmingly pro-town, scum are in a great position. The only thing better would be if the scum were the only ones who looked overwhelmingly pro-town -- but that would probably be worthy of a Scummy award.<br>\n3. Getting on a wagon without adding anything is just bandwagoning. So ICE bandwagoned but he also did so after checking to see if he could get Michel's support -- which from my point of view then looked like scum trying to see just how much support he could get for a mislynch.<br>\n4. To some degree you are right. But getting AV lynched would benefit a scum ICEninja more than a normal mislynch -- it would also eliminate an attacker of his and Pine's. That's why it was a scumtell.<br>\n5&amp;6. I don't really see your problem with these points. It was clearly beneficial for ICEninja scum to NK Aurorus. I presented the two scenarios -- AV dying and AV not dying. The first was good for ICEninja/VE scum. The second was really bad, to the extent that I believed that VE/ICE scum would not want to go with this option even taking into account WIFOM.<br>\n<br>\nAnd what's the problem with warning against a quicklynch? I was basically saying, \"Let's not cut off discussion.\" Discussion ended up being cut off. My warning was completely valid.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Junpei wrote:</cite>Addulsk: Do you think that mafia are very much more likely to be on a town wagon than town?</div></blockquote>No. Being wrong isn't scummy. What matters is how you get on a wagon. In general, pushing a wagon and creating a well-developed case is pro-town regardless of the alignment of the target. If the target is town, then it's still a townie thing to do because scum don't want to stick their heads out on a mislynch. You don't need me to explain why it's a pro-town action if the target is mafia.<br>\n<br>\nOn the other hand, it's scummy to suddenly get on a scum wagon at the last second. That reeks of bussing.<br>\n<br>\n@CES: The way you defend me I wonder why the hell you're voting for me. Why don't you unvote, and maybe SV will also be convinced and we can NOT head to Day 5 lylo. In that case I will probably be replaced, but at least my replacement will not be in such a shitty situation.<br>\n<br>\n@Salamence: Your case on me is two sentences. *buzzer* Try harder. Starting to think the brundibar/Salamence slot is scum. Salamence's current reads (and the lack of real substance to back them up) seems like scum getting ready to get on an easy mislynch (me), among other things.<br>\n<br>\n@Everyone: Do ANY of you still think I was lurking as a STRATEGY? I'm getting replaced here. That's not in any way, shape, or form strategically advantageous.<br>\n<br>\nIf my lynch is inevitable (and it is unless I get two people to unvote or one person to unvote and SV changes his mind) then just lynch me soon before I get replaced because I would feel bad if some poor soul replaces into me, posts like 5 times TRYING to defend my actions, and then promptly gets hammered anyway. Then town loses in lylo or something and they have a town loss on their record out of no fault of their own.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">@Mod: You might want to inform potential replacements that they are in danger of being lynched almost immediately upon replacing in.

Let's look at those two posts:<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4159953#p4159953\" class=\"postlink\">Post 547</a> is trivial, CES says <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Brundibar looks town to me.</div> In the same way you could say Brundibar looks like a kitten or a fireman, it has no rationale behind it that could come into question.<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4161329#p4161329\" class=\"postlink\">Post 555</a> contains two thoughts. Firstly he chooses to not expand on any thoughts for his vote on Alduskkel and the looming lynch. Why? Goodness knows, but it reeks. Secondly, a minor point made on why Brundi seems town, which to me seems damning not because of the point raised but what he chooses to ignore. Remember, this is well before Brundi replaced out, and so a pattern of lurking, weakly justified hammers, and a curious vote on Alduskkel the previous Day with no comment on the major bus (ICE/VE) all seem like things worth scrutinising and discussing. However, the pattern of getting some extensive thoughts from CES on Alduskkel seems continued with his lack of extensive thoughts on why Brundi seems town.<br>\n<br>\nThat Brundi remained absent in light of comments and questions towards him remains damning in itself. Even when taking into account that he replaced out afterwards, this doesn't account for my suspicions of his play in earlier Days. Here are two such moments where questions which I have asked Brundibar previously had been ignored:<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4133905#p4133905\" class=\"postlink\">Post #432</a><br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Why are your votes doing all the talking when you, crucially, seem to keep reasons for doing so to yourself?<br>\n<br>\nFoS @ Brundibar</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4145135#p4145135\" class=\"postlink\">Post #498</a><br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Brundibar, can you explain why you prefer Alduskkel over VE?</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nNow I am at least grateful that Salamence has become active after replacing Brundibar. But this hasn't changed my suspicions, both due to the aforementioned defensiveness on CES' behalf and also in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4176220#p4176220\" class=\"postlink\">Post 602</a> the following is said, <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">\"Cogito Ergo Sum<br>\n<br>\nFaction: Null/town<br>\n<br>\nCan't get a good read, but willing to trust him over the above two.</div>\"<br>\n<br>\nNow where have I heard something like this before? Oh right, CES giving his opinion on the Brundibar/Salamence. They're both calling each other town, but can't really say why. I'm not buying it. Scum team ahoy if you ask me. As a small thought on the side CES saying that I <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">just seem town</div> in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4185703#p4185703\" class=\"postlink\">Post 626</a> is nice to hear and all, but it again lacks any reasoning and justification and to me just seems like a statement made out of convenience rather than anything else.<br>\n<br>\nSome thoughts on the other two:<br>\n<br>\nWhiskers, I would love to hear something from you. I've got a town read on you for various reasons, however one of those is because of my deeper suspicious towards CES/Salamence, which doesn't exactly clear your name. Now is not the time for town to get flakey and remain silent.<br>\n<br>\nJunpei is all town to me. His slot (ac) made an extremely early case on Pine's fakeclaim and was instrumental in bringing about the scum lynch.
