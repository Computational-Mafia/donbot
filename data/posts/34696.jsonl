The site-wide rules apply. If you haven't read them yet, read them. Do not break them.<br>2. Play to win.<br>3. Do not quote any role PMs into the game thread, no PM timestamps or anything else. Paraphrasing is allowed, if in doubt, ask.<br>4. Do not use cryptography, invisible text, tiny text, or anything like that<br>5. Do not edit or delete your posts period.<br>6. Do not impersonate the moderator. I use the <span style=\"color:darkred; font-size:smaller\" title=\"This text is being given out-of-character.\">OOC tag</span> on mod posts and when I edited a player's posts. Please do not use this tag.<br>7. Only talk about the game in the thread unless I have told you otherwise.<br>8. Do not bring outside factors in the game<br>9. No using dice tags or anything that proves randomness.<br>10. Breaking one of the rules may result in a modkill. Modkilling may or may not end the day.<br>11. I reserve the right to change the rules<br>12. If you're dead, you're dead. Not even a \"Bah\" post.<br>13. If I happen to not be online before the end, please let me post the final scene before revealing the result of the game.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Voting Rules:</span><br>1. Votes must be bolded, and in the format of VOTE: Player, using either the bold or the vote tags. Abbreviations, missing punctuation, and misspellings will be accepted as long as it is obvious to me who is being voted for. IMPORTANT: If I perceive it as a vote, it counts as a vote, even if it doesn't follow these rules exactly!<br>2. Unvoting is nice, but is not necessary.<br>3. You may vote to No Lynch, that requires the same number of votes as a lynch vote.<br>4. Once a majority of votes is reached (# of players / 2 + 1, rounded down), that person is lynched.<br>5. All living players, including the lynchee, may continue to post until I lock the thread.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Activity Rules:</span><br>1. Players who have not posted for 72 hours will be prodded.<br>2. Players who do not post within 36 hours of a prod will be replaced.<br>3. If you were to be prodded twice over a game Day or thrice over the whole game, you may be replaced at my discretion.<br>4. If you have declared V/LA, you may be exempted from prods during that time at my discretion.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Deadlines:</span><br>1. Each game Day will have a deadline of fourteen real life days (two weeks).<br>2. Each game Night will have a deadline of three real life days (72 hours).<br>3. In the event deadline is reached before a lynch has occurred, a No Lynch occurs.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Global Vanilla Town PM:</span><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Welcome to The Shadows Within Mafia, you are a Vanilla Townie.<br><br>You have no additional ability except for your vote.<br><br>You may confirm here: <!-- l --><a class=\"postlink-local\" href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=34696\">viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=34696</a><!-- l --> - The game will start when 10 out of 13 people have confirmed.<br><br>You win when all threats to the town are eliminated.</div></blockquote><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Global Mafia Wincon PM:</span><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>You win when you have taken over majority or nothing can stop it from happening.</div></blockquote>"}

Even if we just go with the concept that he thought my logic was bad and needed vetting, and that's not an unreasonable stance to take, I would then expect him, in turn, to be quite comfortable being return vetted as I am doing, instead he's adopting a 'why me?' response to it that makes me feel like he doesn't like being questioned about his reads which then begs the question of why he would question others reads.

And, as I feel I've asked multiple times, can you support that stance on anything but the Brian vote? I personally disagree with you even there, but could at least see the idea as making some sense, but I don't see the idea making any sense for the other two votes.

If I admit every vote has no reasoning then there seems to be little reason to make a RVS vote to create pressure.

But immediatly after your vote, Kid A tells you we're out of RVS. You apologise for posting before you had read page 2, so I assume you had read it by then.

Claims he doesnt like no content posts and votes without explanations, but thats exactly what he did when he voted tool in post 87 and then when he swiftly changed his heart on tool and voting me in 114. All he did is call me scum, pointing to my iso. I think a townie would look at my iso at that point and be unable to simply call scum or town because there was nothing to read. Ask me questions, get me to post, thats all good. Repeatedly call me scum based on the circular argument that im scum because im scum and \"hey guys check this scum's iso its scummy and since its scummy why shouldnt i call you scum\" feels like an aggressive prod at best.</div></blockquote><br><br>I don't like the reasons why your calling me scum neither. Why would you say I \"swiftly changed my heart\" about tool? I don't know if you noticed, but tool and SG had quite the discussion between my vote on him and my unvote. I even explained my reasoning as to why I did no longer think that tool was scummy.<br><br>And how would a townie be supposed to look at your iso and not feel something scummy. It is exactly what you point out here (nothing to read) what made me suspicious of you. Nothing equals anti-town and anti-town is most often scummy as well. Finally, in your most recent posts, you've only said that tool and SG were townish, that I am scum, that you think Emp, Lupo and DarkLight haven't given a lot of content and you've asked a couple of questions. Why don't you give opinions on other players so far? And for the record, I'm not the only person voting you. What is your opinion on smargaret, both on her reasoning for her vote on you and her play in general so far?"}

Approach to conversation seems genuine, so I give him a weak townread. Stated intent to hammer Kid A in #264, which should be revisited based on flips.<br>Kid: Early game discussion driver, equal opportunity questioning looks pro-town. If ABR were to flip scum, the wagon he pushed against Kid would make me suspicious that Kid was on the receiving end of a designed bussing attempt. #278 looks towny because he didn't want to hop on an easy wagon, which could have distracted from the wagon against him.<br>Slandaar: Hard to read -- more or less seems to be playing to his town meta in the game I was in with him (with the exception of getting into a huge argument with another player, but that doesn't need to happen every game for him to be town I'm sure). Willing to give a tentative town read.<br>SG: Biggest piece of evidence I've got is the fact that she wanted me to write a wall of text about her after I'd already given up my case against her. This seems counterintuitive for scum.<br><br>Null<br><br>ABR: Doesn't have the same attitude as he did when I played with him as town, but he linked to that game in #94, which tells me he's not concerned about people knowing his meta. Has done pro-town things and things that pinged my scumdar. Could go either way.<br>Emp: Not a whole lot to go off of. Started out with a vote on me for a \"meh\" reason, which is fine early d1. Later switched votes to TvK in #308, which could be scum switching because of town unwillingness to sheep or town switching because he got the reactions he wanted. Overall not putting in a ton of effort -- again, the motivation for this could come from either direction.<br>Lark: In #48, he agrees that Kid A bringing up his scumclaim again (which totally made sense for Kid to do, btw), was weird. This pings my gut scumdar, but it's early enough in the game I could see it coming from town trying to get things off the ground (get it...because he's a lark...and larks fly...) Doesn't seem eager to put votes on people, and in #347 avoids a developing wagon against TvK -- seems town, but I'm not ready to put him in the towny category quite yet.<br>Lupo: Scumhunting seems genuine, but leaving vote on SG for most of D1 and then defending it the way he did in #334 could be scum indecision/caution. Need more to work with.<br>Smargaret: Not much to say. Scumhunting seems genuine, but lawd knows I've been fooled before so I'm not willing to give anything but a null to this.<br>TvK: Nothing really jumped out except the \"I'm fine with getting lynched\" in #316. That's an awfully strange thing to say, but I could see it coming from either side. So null, for now.<br><br>Scummy<br><br>Dark: Posts show a willingness to vote for lots of people/not really giving a whole lot of thought to whether they're scum (see #204, #206, #225, #319, #320). Mostly a gut read, but I'd be comfortable lynching this today.<br>Kravhen: Looks uncomfortable under pressure and wants to move it elsewhere (see #130, #171, #243), which is something I might expect from a scum player returning from a hiatus. Disappeared once wagon started to form on him, which I believe coincided with site downtime, so unfortunately can't be called a scumtell."}

Please and thank you.</div></blockquote><br><br>I thought it was well obvious for observant eyes that irrespective of my read on TvK his case on Lupo was something I agreed on enough for not minding the either lynch. Nothing says scum can't be logical and they are especially productive when they are the largest bandwagon of the day. Its a good enough chance for getting those people running individual wagon to take stance in near end of deadline by offering them another wagon. In my POV, in this format of mafia, town benefit from 2 wagons at the end of D1 since it results in better player analysis on D2. Especially when game is consisting of so many players who for some reason believe that they can run their respective  wagon targets to lynch even though they are the only ones voting them in less than last 3 days(?). You pick, what looks better, 1 major wagon on someone you're not even voting getting lynched and 7 other minor wagons which provide enough hide for other scums? or 2 major wagons with everyone picking 1 out of the 2?<br>Also, I'm testing one theory of mine, generally when scum is pegged on D1 other scums try to get town-cred from bussing him but looking at speed of TvK wagon its starting to looks like his possible buddies are not on his wagon. Now if you add this theory to  the current no. of wagons in the game it's obvious that other wagon is needed to lure them and what's better than the handpicked scum candidate from the target of larger wagon? In worst case scenario we might not lynch scum today but we will have scum pool for tomorrow reduced by half.<br> <br>-that made me sleepy, GN-"}

Scumhunting seems genuine, but lawd knows I've been fooled before so I'm not willing to give anything but a null to this.<br>TvK: Nothing really jumped out except the \"I'm fine with getting lynched\" in #316.

That said, if you're scum, then you can stay off a likely-mislynch wagon and come out smelling like roses tomorrow.  <br><br>Combined with an iso that's more theory discussion than anything else, and Lupo isn't looking too towny right now.<br><br>Kravhen, also, has vanished now that pressure has backed off him some, and all the initial reasons for thinking he's scummy remain.

These are my conclusions:<br><br>Definitely not a WW: smargaret, SG<br><br>Probably not a WW: Kid A, tool, Om<br><br>Unsure: <br>ABR, for first being reluctant to join the wagon and then the quickhammer. Still I think he is not likely to be a WW.<br>Slandaar, he had Lupo as \"unsure\" and then when the wagon started he was all like \"why vote Lupo, I see no case on Lupo\" and he eventually even called him town before his flip. But I think his town read on Lupo after he was hammered had more to do with his scumread of ABR, so still unsure on him.<br><br>Most likely to be a WW:<br>Lark: he suspected Lupo for a brief while when the wagon started forming, but then quickly backed down after a meta check. Near the end of the day, he declared that he'd rather see Lupo lynched than me, but went on to start a new wagon on tool. What I find very suspicious about this: I also meta'd Lupo and the most curious thing is that of his completed games where he didn't replace out of, he was town only once, and he got lynched day 1. All the other times he was scum. I'd like to know how Lark concluded from that meta that Lupo was likely town... Also the vote on tool was pointless. There was no way that tool was ever going to be lynched yesterday.<br><br>Brian: Well, pretty strange that I ended up putting him here, since he started the analysis on Lupo's buddy. When you control+F Lupo in Brian's ISO, you'll find 6 results. The first 3 were neutral questions about his early vote on SG. The forth one is about claiming at L-1, pretty empty. And most interestingly, the last 2, both quotes of the starters of the Lupo wagon. SG says \"I'd be ok lynching Lupo as an alternative to ABR\", and Brian asks about her case on ABR. Smargaret comments on kravhen's inactivity but then says \"I'd like to see what comes out off a Lupo wagon\", and Brian's response is about kravhen's inactivity. In both cases, SG and smargaret declared obvious scumreads on Lupo, and in both cases Brian ignores that. Brian never commented on anything concerning the Lupo wagon the entire day. If you ask me, this is a classic example of distancing."}

Also the posts he refers to are the posts where DarkLightA is switching his vote around from kravhen to me to Kid A and then back to me. I'd rather call that behaviour town. I mostly find it strange how his vote on a strong scumread switched to someone else based on \"mostly gut\". Next up is his readslist.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5543406#p5543406\" class=\"postlink\">post 356</a>, toolenduso wrote:</cite>Towny<br><br>Brian: Interacts with other people a lot/does a lot of work (see #253).  Approach to conversation seems genuine, so I give him a weak townread. Stated intent to hammer Kid A in #264, which should be revisited based on flips.<br>Kid: Early game discussion driver, equal opportunity questioning looks pro-town. If ABR were to flip scum, the wagon he pushed against Kid would make me suspicious that Kid was on the receiving end of a designed bussing attempt. #278 looks towny because he didn't want to hop on an easy wagon, which could have distracted from the wagon against him.<br>Slandaar: Hard to read -- more or less seems to be playing to his town meta in the game I was in with him (with the exception of getting into a huge argument with another player, but that doesn't need to happen every game for him to be town I'm sure). Willing to give a tentative town read.<br>SG: Biggest piece of evidence I've got is the fact that she wanted me to write a wall of text about her after I'd already given up my case against her. This seems counterintuitive for scum.<br><br>Null<br><br>ABR: Doesn't have the same attitude as he did when I played with him as town, but he linked to that game in #94, which tells me he's not concerned about people knowing his meta. Has done pro-town things and things that pinged my scumdar. Could go either way.<br>Emp: Not a whole lot to go off of. Started out with a vote on me for a \"meh\" reason, which is fine early d1. Later switched votes to TvK in #308, which could be scum switching because of town unwillingness to sheep or town switching because he got the reactions he wanted. Overall not putting in a ton of effort -- again, the motivation for this could come from either direction.<br>Lark: In #48, he agrees that Kid A bringing up his scumclaim again (which totally made sense for Kid to do, btw), was weird. This pings my gut scumdar, but it's early enough in the game I could see it coming from town trying to get things off the ground (get it...because he's a lark...and larks fly...) Doesn't seem eager to put votes on people, and in #347 avoids a developing wagon against TvK -- seems town, but I'm not ready to put him in the towny category quite yet.<br>Lupo: Scumhunting seems genuine, but leaving vote on SG for most of D1 and then defending it the way he did in #334 could be scum indecision/caution. Need more to work with.<br>Smargaret: Not much to say. Scumhunting seems genuine, but lawd knows I've been fooled before so I'm not willing to give anything but a null to this.<br>TvK: Nothing really jumped out except the \"I'm fine with getting lynched\" in #316. That's an awfully strange thing to say, but I could see it coming from either side. So null, for now.<br><br>Scummy<br><br>Dark: Posts show a willingness to vote for lots of people/not really giving a whole lot of thought to whether they're scum (see #204, #206, #225, #319, #320). Mostly a gut read, but I'd be comfortable lynching this today.<br>Kravhen: Looks uncomfortable under pressure and wants to move it elsewhere (see #130, #171, #243), which is something I might expect from a scum player returning from a hiatus. Disappeared once wagon started to form on him, which I believe coincided with site downtime, so unfortunately can't be called a scumtell.</div></blockquote><br><br>The first thing that catches my eye was the enormous amount of null reads. Might just be me, but that's quite useful for a scum that's trying to keep his options open.  Also note that of his 4 town reads, 1 is \"weak\", 1 is \"tentative\" and 1 is possibly \"on the receiving end of a bus\". Scumreads are both gut based too. Conclusion: pretty much no reads. Next up.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5547529#p5547529\" class=\"postlink\">post 386</a>, toolenduso wrote:</cite>@Om <strike>of the Nom</strike>: Yo.<br><br>1. No different than they were in my reads list.<br>2. I'll have to go through their ISOs again because I don't feel strongly about either one.<br><br>Om looks pretty scummy to me right now and it's not even entirely his fault. Let's recap: Kravhen gets pressured, acts really uncomfortable about it and then disappears. He gets replaced by Om, who jumps for the lowest hanging fruit in TvK (ironically, this is exactly what my scumpartner did in the first roll of the newbie Om and I just played together). Then, after listing a null read on Lupo, he lets the person he was just ready to lynch (TvK) persuade him in one post to hop onto the wagon against Lupo instead.<br><br>ScumOm explanation: Slot predecessor Kravhen felt like he'd already messed up and decided it would be better for the scumteam to replace out (or that he just didn't want to get lynched). Om replaces in and (if TvK is scum) busses his partner immediately in the hopes of gaining towncred or (if TvK is town) goes for the bandwagon that looks most likely to head for a lynch, knowing well that deadline is approaching. Then (if TvK is scum), he proposes a counterwagon for the other player town has already put on the chopping block or (if TvK is town), switches his vote over to Lupo because he thinks it's more likely to succeed or because he just feels better about the Lupo wagon succeeding.<br>TownOm explanation: Slot predecessor Kravhen replaces out for any number of unknown reasons. Om replaces in and lets himself be easily swayed by existing town opinions because deadline is approaching.<br><br>Of those two, the scum explanation makes more sense to me. Either way, here's what I think for tomorrow if we get a flip on Om or Lupo -- if Om is scum, Lupo isn't and it makes TvK look pretty suspicious.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Om</span>.<br><br>I'll respond to Om's case against me/Dark's defense of himself in my next post.</div></blockquote><br><br>This feels so incredibly forced. Om is scum because kravhen was scum, followed by an explanation in which Om first is scum in any case (according to him that is related to my alignment, but also not, because he's scum when I'm scum and when I'm town), and then an explanation why Om would be town. Once again his conclusion of \"scum makes more sense\" is so very unconvincing, even to himself.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5552896#p5552896\" class=\"postlink\">post 407</a>, toolenduso wrote:</cite>I don't expect to be able to get on a lot for the rest of the day, so<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Lupo</span><br><br>For the reason in my reads list.

Nobody would question him jumping on it so close to the deadline, and it would (assumably) be an easy mislynch. And I find it really strange how Om would suddenly be \"very town\" when Lupo would flip scum. That read changed quickly from his last post where he was fairly certain of Omscum.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5571574#p5571574\" class=\"postlink\">post 435</a>, toolenduso wrote:</cite>Well with DarkLight having townflipped and Om looking very unlikely to be scum after his vote for Lupo, I'm going to have to reassess my reads.<br><br>But let's kick it off with this -- for the people who said they thought ABR was scum because of his quickhammer, what do you think of him after seeing Lupo flip scum?</div></blockquote><br><br>This was his first post of day 2. He's still convinced that Om is town because Lupo flipped scum. How is that even close to possible? We had two nightkills, Lupo flipped WW, not mafia. He clearly had not thought at all about anything when posting this, but it seems that the only thing he's trying to point out to us is that Om is most likely town.

The first one had \"was eaten\" as flavor for nightkills, so town obviously knew they were dealing with werewolves. The second one even had werewolves in the title. And for the final one, \"you win when all werewolves are dead\" was the towns win condition. Only the third one had werewolves that could kill with bullets and even a cop that was totally worthless because it only got maf/not maf results with a werewolf team.

Even now, your explanation is \"whelp, things are totally rolla-coasting!\" and you...basically state no reads, and...don't like, ask things, or question things, you just kind of state that reads are generically in flux and then sort of nod your head at me as though I'm supposed to think that doesn't show lethargy. I think it screams lethargy. I'd be quite content with you being a lynch at this point, and think Tool is much more pro-town than you."}

That would be you, Om, Lark, Penguindaar, TvK, and maybe at a squint Brian as he's a low riding town read but, hey. The reads for me that have changed over the last two days? I suppose that would be firmly placing Tool down as a town read, there are probably some other shifts, but they are minor enough so as to not be really exciting as they'd be like \"a scum read became slightly more/less scummy but is still a scum read\" type stuff. Pretty boring. I'm not sure what you mean by rank? You mean, like, on a scale of town to scum? You're in the scummy side, I don't think you're particularly helping town in any meaningful way and I think you've done some blatant anti-town stuff. That doesn't make you scum, but it sure as pistachios doesn't leave you town or null for me. Even like your most recent push on me right here, I don't really see the value of what you're up to. You're complaining that I haven't accused anyone...while apparently either not being aware that Penguindaar is who I'm working and she's being lurky or not caring about the same - that's just sloppy and makes me question how much you actually care about what you're doing, which is an example of why I don't think you're being helpful. You don't feel connected to the game, you're a scary face that shows up every two days or so and screams at people and then goes away."}

I still don't see how that makes what Albert did pro-town. There were a number of players with town reads on Smargey already. Heck, I'd just offered a case for town Smargey and neither of the two players poking at her had bothered to address it, and instead Albert was all like 'time ta fake claim to force a real claim!' That is a player who doesn't care about town cohesion. Now, maybe it's because he's town and is just so sure of his play that he doesn't need anyone else...but, frankly, if that's the case his read on Smargey was pretty bad and is proven wrong even by his 'scumhunting' so I'm not sure why he thinks he's that good. I don't think he's paying a lot of attention to the game either for someone who thinks he should run off and do his own thing and it doesn't matter what anyone else is thinking or doing (as examples, he thinks I'm voting him...he's skimming, and he thinks it's his business to pull gambit claims at this stage?...ehhh, I do not like it.)<br><br>But because it \"saves town\" wherein, even if you *and* Albert are both town that's a grand total of two people distracted by Smargey, I still don't see the grand win to town because it's still down to personal interpretation if her reaction was a town one or not. Conversely Albert could have gotten a real Tracker/Watcher to counterclaim him, he could have outed Smargey as having an actual role, he could have accomplished so much that was purely pro-scum and he backed out of it with a 'I was gambiting' reply. It's terrible and I'm still not sure why you're convinced it was pro-town. What am I missing here? Simply that all the possible bad endings *didn't* occur? Is that it?"}

I'm not anymore trying to get him lynched today, because I wouldn't be able to convince anyone and I've realised that it just isn't the right choice for today. I'd rather lynch his suspected partner Om today because that lynch will give us tons of information and possibly we can be certain of tool's alignment after the night.

She asked about your reads on Slandaar/Penguin and smargaret and she disagreed on both of them. However, the argument stopped kind of right in the middle when Albert pulled his \"smargaret who did you target last night\". After that you dropped your smargaret scumread, so SG never came back to it."}

A lot depends on the veracity of Tool but I am choosing to believe Tool pretty solidly at this stage, at that point I think Om starts looking like a really bad lynch option. Lark, as I feel I just said, is definitely someone I am interested in the lynch of, if it came down to a Lark or nothing I'd vote Lark in a heartbeat and count myself clever. That said, I like the idea of lynching you too, and I certainly have no issue with having some competing wagons right now as I think that's rather neato-keen too."}

I don't move my votes unless I really have a strong lead on someone. SG was my first vote and a lynch based on something that early in the game is stupid.

I will admit I can't think of his case on Om offhand, but let's do an iso. Looking in iso he has not actually made a case on Om, but apparently he seems to think that he isn't scumbuddies with you but is scumbuddies with Lupo through some sort of odd bussing theory. I think that's a pretty bad and poorly expressed case, but it is sadly in line with about as well as he has expressed any read. Is your stance that we should lynch him because he's unhelpful? I'm not fully against that as a concept, but if that's the extent of the case why not lynch Penguin, who is also lurky and unhelpful?</div></blockquote><br><br>I had Lark as my main suspect for being a buddy of Lupo right when this day started. Mostly for distancing from Lupo, briefly calling him null and then voting for tool when it was clear that either me or Lupo was going to be the lynch. With the entire multiball discussion starting, I never got to putting my vote on him, but when it calmed down, I got there. Now today he has been lurky and unhelpful, which I really don't like because its extremely anti-town. Normally just being anti-town isn't enough to become scum in my book, but these two things combined make Lark by far the most scummy person, especially after Om's claim.<br><br>Well, I went through Slandaar's posts again and my conclusion is that Slandaar was totally not in the game. He was pretty much a non-entity and his reads were pretty bad when I look at them with the information we have now. Penguin continued this trend until she finally started getting into it. I can see what you're saying about asking feedback from weaker townreads, but you've got to admit that her stronger townreads (Kid A and tool) are either not posting at all, or just waiting for town to give them an order of who to kill tonight. Next to that, I liked her interactions with Om."}

I don't think it is anti-town to give out your town reads day 1, but I do think it was anti-town that you totally disappeared when Albert pulled off his gambit and didn't even say that you actually were townreading smargaret when she came under pressure.</div></blockquote><br>So I was expected to predict in advance that Albert was going to do that was I? It would have been inappropriate for me to comment before smargaret replied to Albert if that's what you are suggesting here. <br>I did not \"totally disappear\", unless you think I ought to have stayed awake all night to see what happened. Timings for me were as follows: <br>6:26 pm  Albert's post to smargaret<br>7:12 pm  I respond to a post by Kid A<br>2:58 am  smarg claims VT<br>3:30 am  Albert challenges her<br>4:11 am  smarg repeats her claim and votes Albert<br>5:40 am Albert admits it was a bluff<br>11:41 am I give my response.<br>If it's anti-town to sleep at night then I guess I can't help that. (And before you bring it up, yes I have sometimes posted in the middle of the night but that's due to rl reasons which didn't occur on the night in question.)<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5605506#p5605506\" class=\"postlink\">post 901</a>, TvK wrote:</cite>I think it's safe to say that you have been one of the lesser contributors so far in this game.

Let's look over the possibilities:<br><br>1. There are two scum groups, werewolves and mafia, and only mafia would give the gunsmith a positive result -- not werewolves. So by including a town gunsmith, the moderator has given an advantage to the werewolf faction and put the mafia faction at a disadvantage.<br>2. There is only one scum faction, the werewolves, and they get a gunsmith so they can find out who the town vig is (and bodyguard maybe -- I don't know, would a bodyguard have a gun?)</div></blockquote>1. I assume either the mafia have something to counter my role and/or we also have something to help us find werewolves. As the game's been reviewed I doubt any side has an unfair disadvantage.<br>2. Giving the werewolves a gunsmith would give them too much advance information about possible roles. A cop isn't a danger to them so having that role would imply either a vig or a second scum group.</div></blockquote>1. Even if there were two scum factions and the mafia had something to help block your abilities, that would mean the mod and reviewers OK'd a town PR that only applied to one scum faction and not the other. This does not make sense, at all. And if that's not the case and we instead have two investigative roles, that would mean they included a vig solely for the purpose of finding town PR's, which is a baffling idea.<br>2. No. What? No. Are you actually suggesting that scum never gets investigative roles? And how would it be advance information? They would have to investigate N1 and get results at the conclusion of the night, so their N1 kill wouldn't be influenced by their gunsmith's investigation. And who said anything about a cop?</div></blockquote><br>1. Yes it does make sense. If the mafia group has better powers than the ww group that could balance things out, as I've already described. And I don't believe they did include a vig.<br>2. I said nothing of the sort! Of course they can get investigative roles. But things like a rolecop or a tracker wouldn't give any indication of what other roles might be in the game.

If I don't, I'll die and town will know once and for all that we are actually only dealing with one scum faction. Town will then be in good position to win."}

It makes sense that Lark indeed used his gunsmith power on you this night, because he was suspecting you at the end of day 1. Then he immediatly went after you when he got the positive result and that he thought of a multiball scenario. It explains why Lark through the entire day 2 kept on scumreading you, even when everyone else had stopped voting you.<br><br>I don't buy SG's claim because it came at the worst moment possible. There was no need at all to claim when she claimed. If she thought Lark was scum, than she also just could have pushed for him without claim, and if he didn't get lynched, just investigate someone else that night and get Lark lynched today.

Because multiball would be extremely unlikely with a town vig in the game.<br>2. Because multiball would be even less likely based on the fact that there was only one kill last night.<br>3. Because if there isn't multiball then the only scum faction is werewolves, which a town GS wouldn't be able to investigate -- therefore, it wouldn't make sense for town to have a GS.<br>4. Because I shot at Lark last night and Lark didn't die. Om couldn't have protected him because if he did I wouldn't have my shot left, meaning that by process of elimination a scum roleblocker is the reason my kill didn't go through.<br>5. A scum RB wouldn't block my kill if I was targeting town.<br><br>From where I'm sitting, there is no way in hell Lark is anything but scum.

This is moot as I don't think you're a vig.<br>2. Why? You said you were blocked so that's still potentially two kills, even if you or your partner weren't actually blocked and just didn't send a kill or something else intervened.<br>3. It wouldn't make sense for town to have a GS if there isn't multiball which proves it is multiball from my point of view.<br>4. We only have your word for it that you tried to shoot and were roleblocked. <br>5. They may have done it for the WIFOM or for their own benefit. After all I can't detect werewolves so they may have been hoping I would find the other mafia.<br><br>Basically none of it makes sense unless you already believe tool to be a vig rather than mafia.

Whether tool is town or Mafia, he was pretty assuredly roleblocked.  Since that power wasn't claimed by town, it would have to be from scum, and scum would only have motive to block tool if his kill was aimed at said scum.  As there's no reason to frame Lark to set up his lynch instead of letting him be NK'd, I think.  As tool claiming a kill on a town gunsmith would set up his lynch instead, meaning that if a werewolf faction was trying to avoid the lynch, they'd get more out of letting tool's shot through.<br><br>Basically multiball here means werewolves have to have minimum one PR to offset the claimed investigational disadvantage.  Roleblock makes sense; tool's kill regardless of alignment was blocked, KISS says Lark is scum or at least worth getting a flip on.  Gunsmith flip means I'm comfortable lynching tool next.  Not seeing a town flip that isn't a gunsmith, but if Lark is lying town, I have no idea.<br><br>The complexity required for this to be multiball makes me think it's unlikely.  Which would mean that a scum-Lark flip should have us hunting for another wolf unless this is 11:2 and it's game over--very unlikely if we have a town 2-shot vig.  That would clear tool and you.  You cleared Brian.  So the last werewolf is in: ABR, Kid A, smargaret, TvK.  I'm pretty convinced of ABR-town.  I know people are scum-reading TvK, but I don't see it.  So probably the last werewolf is between Kid A and smargaret.  Likely smargaret, and I'd endorse a vig shot there tonight.<br><br>So yeah, that's where I'm at presently.  Mostly I think Lark flipping will show us the lay of the land, whatever that is."}

And then totally out of the blue, he hammers Lupo, without ever saying anything about him than the above quotes. To answer Albert's question if I think he would bus both of his scumbuddies, I'll answer \"Yes, I totally think you're capable of doing that\".<br><br>Then on day two, he starts off supporting the idea of multiball, but when he notices not everyone is on board, he backs off again. Not to mention the fake-guilty on Smargaret.

Yes, I think it really was his plan to bus Lark, but then he backed off. And yes, Albert, I think you're \"crazy enough to throw them both under the bus\", I really do. And then after the bodyguard claim by Om and Lark's fakeclaim, Albert knew there had to be a Seeker in play. It was smart to popcorn me first because he knew I was anxious to prove that Lark's claim was true so I had a reason to lynch Tool again. My apologies for my stupidity, once again. And I must admit, his brainless posts at the end of day 2 worked perfectly to get to a no-lynch and to get the Seeker nightkilled. Luckily for town, Om wasn't as brainless as I was, and SG managed to live another day.<br><br>Finally, day 3, he once again started off following me on a Tool lynch. But when he noticed that that was going nowhere, he moved back to Lark. He's jumping a bit too much for being such a confident player. His constant pushing of a Smargaret vig makes me wonder if he had the balls to not block Tool and hope that he would shoot Smargaret. I think we can't rule out this possibility, so Albert should still be under the radar (and yes, that means me too).<br><br>I'm perfectly fine with lynching Penguin today, because she is the only other possibility that I can see as scum if I'm being way too paranoid again about Albert. But I just hope that we won't quicklynch Kid A the day after if Penguin happens to be town."}

One of the metrics was \"percentage of posts per day 1\" (PPPD1), the formula for which is (# of posts player made on D1)/(# of posts all players made on D1).<br><br>Here were the percentages for the three town games I analyzed for ABR:<br><br>Mini 1505: 17.67%<br>Mini 1357: 13.57% (no joke, this was the actual percentage)<br>Mini 1499: 9.34%<br>Average: 13.53%<br><br>Here were the percentages for the three scum games I analyzed for ABR:<br><br>Mini 1493: 9.1%<br>Newbie 1133: 14.18%<br>Open 276: 8.93%<br>Average: 10.74%<br><br>His PPPD1 for this game is 12%.<br><br>So that's one piece of evidence for ABR being town.

The instant I saw Lark push a TvK wagon, I stopped reading and hammered. I DO know what was said around the votes (i.e. Lark's townread on Penguin and me stating not to put a wagon at L-1 unless you were willing to risk an Albert quickhammer), but gameflow-wise, it turned out to be exactly what it looked like."}
