Read them and then do not break them. Some of them are so important they're listed here as well, because redundancy is your friend.<br>\n2. Play to win. Most players want to win legitimately, don't ruin their enjoyment by playing against your wincon.<br>\n3. If you have the ability to edit or delete your posts in this thread, don't do it.<br>\n4. Do not quote anywhere any PMs between you and me (including role PMs), or anything else that originated outside of the game thread. This includes PM timestamps and anything else which games the system. Paraphrasing is allowed. If in doubt, ask.<br>\n5. Do not use cryptography, invisible text, tiny text, or anything like that.<br>\n6. Do not impersonate or pretend to be the moderator. I make and edit posts using the 0000FF tag, please do not use it.<br>\n7. Unless the moderator has specifically told you it is allowed, do not talk about this game outside of this game thread or PTs I provide you until I have announced that the game is over.<br>\n8. Do not bring outside factors into this game. This includes, among other things, making bets, promises of real life rewards, etc.<br>\n9. Do not use any form of provable randomness. Claiming you rolled dice and acting on that is fine. Using dice tags is not.<br>\n10. Pretending to break a rule will be treated the same as breaking the rule. It's up to my discretion whether I think you pretended to break or rule or not, so if you're not sure, ask first.<br>\n11. We're all here to have fun. Tempers may flare, but avoid personal attacks and keep it civil. I will have very little tolerance if someone complains about the way you're talking to them.<br>\n12. Breaking one of these rules may, at my discretion, result in a modkill. If you are modkilled, you will become a Neutral Survivor, and thus automatically lose. Modkilling may or may not end the game day.<br>\n13. I reserve the right to change the rules. Rule changes will be updated here as well as posted in thread.<br>\n14. If you are dead, that is it. Do not post. Not even a \"Bah\" post.<br>\n15. If I happen to not be online but you know the game is over (for example, if scum get a quicklynch in during LyLo), please let me post the final scene before revealing the ending or otherwise discussing the game.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Voting Rules</div></div><br>\n1. Votes must be bolded, and in the format of VOTE: Player, using either the bold or the vote tags. Abbreviations, missing punctuation, and misspellings will be accepted as long as it is obvious to me who is being voted for. IMPORTANT: If I perceive it as a vote, it counts as a vote, even if it doesn't follow these rules exactly!<br>\n2. Unvoting is nice, but is not necessary.<br>\n3. You may vote to No Lynch, that requires the same number of votes as a lynch vote.<br>\n4. Once a majority of votes is reached (# of players / 2 + 1, rounded down), that person is lynched.<br>\n5. All living players, including the lynchee, may continue to post until I lock the thread.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Activity Rules</div></div><br>\n1. Prod system: Players who have not posted for 48 hours will be prodded; players who do not post within 24 hours of a prod will be replaced. If you were to be prodded three times over the whole game, you may be replaced at my discretion. If you have declared V/LA, you may be exempted from prods during that time at my discretion.<br>\n2. In the event replacements are necessary, the deadline may be extended at my discretion.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Deadlines</div></div><br>\n1. Day will have a deadline of fourteen real life days.<br>\n2. Night will have a deadline of three real life days.<br>\n3. In the event deadline is reached before a lynch has occurred, a No Lynch occurs.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\"><br>\nGame Setup</div></div><br>\nThis game has been approved for normalcy and balance.

I hadn't read your post sufficiently at the time I posted mine, so I wasn't aware our opinions were as close as they were - I was focused mainly on Frag's posts at the time. My reads on Axwell and Sword Master were in fact tacked on, because I didn't really have much more to say about them at the time, other than \"hey these things flagged something for me\". I stand by my weak scumread on Axwell - He piled on a bandwagon bringing it to L-2 during RVS. He is new to games on this site, as per his own admission. It's not out of the question, in my mind, for his vote to be a newbscum move.<br>\n<br>\nAs for Sword Master's claim, it did read very much like a role PM quote to me. I don't think he would have been able to make up something like that himself. At this point for me he might as well be conftown. This read may of course change down the road, but based on his meta and his playstyle, I don't have much doubt he is telling the truth. I felt like it was a little game-breaking for him to do that because it seems so obviously true, but hey, if he's lying, maaaad props to Sword Master.

I found DV not explaining his vote fairly townie (mostly because I think he's picking up on the most same scumvibes I'm getting from Glass), and it's particularly common for more experienced players to do that, something which I expect Garmr to be familiar with since he's also been around this forum a while. In addition, his own explanation of his vote was also lacking, since DV is mostly saying he's not interested in detailed explanations/pushing wagons to lynch at this stage (we're what, 3 days into Day 1) and Garmr tried to spin that into DV being uninterested in getting lynches at all.<br>\n<br>\nNow, I'm curious about your response.

To me there could be more reasons to vote someone than just wanting them lynched... especially with a week and a half until deadline.

Yes I know I defended the wagon so to speak beginning of the game on him but I wasn't so much defending Blocky the player but the fact that there was so many \"RVS\" votes on Blocky to start the game off.<br>\n<br>\nFrom what I've seen from Blocky so far, he's been sheeping reads every other post then been matching opposite posts with fluff. I don't have a town read at all in fact right now I would have him null leaning scum. His lurking also sets off a flag for me. Call it bad town play but I associate at times lurking with opportunistic scum who rather sit back &amp; watch town go to war with each other or just may not feel comfortable playing the game as scum so they don't want to give too much info to other players in the game. Blocky is very bleh right now to me.<br>\n<br>\nAs for the rest of the game. I'm not quite sure what to make of things. I gotta admit as a decently new player, playing outside of the newbie Q is a little overwhelming. I'm still kind of weary of Yolo. Just don't have a solid read on him. Garmr pushed on me pretty early but towards the end I was kind of getting a town vibe off of them from their scum hunting. I don't know what to make of the Scorpious/Red interaction. I still need to go back &amp; look at that &amp; their ISOs. They've been going pretty hard on each other for a few pages now. There could possibly be one between them. Glass is null for me right now, need to read more into them. DeasVail I still want to see their logic behind the vote before I make a decision as I've said before. Victor has pretty much disappeared again after being active just a tad bit. Firebringer I have a null read with a split lean. I think it could go either way . They seem to be scum hunting or at least trying. Slandaar I didn't like the vote on Sword. I was a little confused by the logic you used for voting on a un'cced PR. Was weird so I flagged it. Sword doesn't get lynched period. Should be the Night Kill &amp; there should be two kills in the night. If one of those two scenarios doesn't happen then we need to look real close at Sword D2. <br>\n<br>\nSorry I know it's not much to go off. Call me bad town or whatever. I'm going to try to read back so I can provide more.", "time": "Mon Jul 27, 2015 12:40 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=62742&start=250", "forum": "53", "thread": "62742"}

I was suspicious of Blocky before, but now, especially with the very obvious opposition there is to anyone suspecting SwordMaster, it just seems really unlikely. Like, what is his plan here if scum? He could have grand ambitions of getting SwordMaster lynched, but he is not trying nearly hard enough for that, even if we ignore that glaring lack of likelihood of that happening anyway. If he doesn't want to get SwordMaster lynched and is 'suspecting' him for show, then what does he hope to achieve from that. I think it would be a fairly expected thing that people would find him scummy for it!

Then you once again town read me as \"newb town\". You pose a close ended question to Blocky &amp; Red, then top off your posts with a vote on Garmr who you were reading scum after a vote on Deas for a read we've yet to see yet. 191, 193, &amp; 194 is basically more fluff. Weak scum hunting in 196, but you give the explanation in 205, where it seems you're trying to buddy up to Yolo who also has been pretty removed from the game. 266 brings a unexplained vote on fire but is still fluff. 267 MOAR fluff. You disappear for another 50+ posts again until you post 322 where you accuse Fire of giving a \"cop out\" answer.

In future though, simply stated would be more helpful. And as another word of guidance, not linking to external sites is also preferable (I don't have a big deal with it personally but I've known people flat out refuse to click any link that didn't go to a well known site).<br>\n<br>\nOk, so you have one completed game (I'm ignoring the reroll). So I guess I should educate you on a few more things.<br>\n<br>\nFirst, knowing a player's experience is important in mafia. Knowing how long someone has played can help you with their reads. Someone who has been playing for years, will likely view something different to someone who has been playing weeks (again, this feels eerily similar to something I said earlier with regards to DV). Asking someone for their experience is not a fluff question at all.<br>\n<br>\nSecond, and this is why I asked in the first place, why would a player with only one completed game think he needs to lead other townies? Do you really not think that experienced players would need to be told to remember that Slandar is in the game? I don't like your explanation for your motives for 400 one bit and one of the reason I'm scumreading.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I'm falling over myself to avoid calling you scum?

Even if Glass was keeping quiet the fact that he maybe thought Sword was scum like I was, attacking people for voting Sword doesn't make any sense? It would make much more sense for him to actually consider that Sword might be scum considering his investigation into the quote rule. And if anything I had a positive reaction to anyone voting for Sword because they were at risk of some town mob bearing down on them if they did.

If scum tried to kill Doctor, then Red would die obviously. So why didn't Doctor's shot go through on me though if they were a real vigi? I'm not protected in any way.

Trying to change this is in an attempt to be read as town by you just seems really unappealing given that you're reading me based on some confident knowledge of my play and who I am as a person when it's obviously incorrect. I think Scorpious is scum and I am on his wagon. I'm not going to push hard for him to be lynched at this time because I want content from fitz first. It looks like you're going to have a problem with me scumreading Scorpious anyway since it's apparently so obvious for town to see, but by saying this and that the only reason for anyone scumreading him is being clouded by scum pushes, and nothing more, you're making any engagement with you difficult.<br>\n<br>\nFirebringer I've been reading as weak town. I actually liked the way that he responded to the Blocky lynch. There was a whole lot of bravado while the Blocky wagon was happening, but then Day 2 there really is a sudden shift, and to me it seems like a genuine one based on being wrong. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7128530#p7128530\">622</a> is loads different from Day 1 and it comes across as real to me. And I like the reconsidering of reads done in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7130140#p7130140\">648</a>. The same thing occurs again in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7139726#p7139726\">792</a> so it's consistent. It is possible that this is a plan by scum and so the read is only weak, but my guess is that it's town.<br>\n<br>\nMy read on Fragger is less specific and more a general impression, but his thoughts are just wildly all over the place in a way that I feel is much more likely to come from town than scum. There are logical inconsistencies which I feel scum would be careful to avoid (yet I could see them from town) and it just doesn't seem like a scum-behaviour to me.", "time": "Thu Aug 13, 2015 8:25 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=62742&start=825", "forum": "53", "thread": "62742"}

Shaded kind of just fits in as PoE scum but I don't really have much reason for that. And then we have Fragger and Gray as sort of outside choices but they're less scummy to me.<br>\n<br>\nSo onto why Havingfitz is scum.<br>\n<br>\nIn addition to my reasons or suspecting GlassCannon, I think his play around the Scorp wagon yesterday was really sketchy and I suspect him even more now.<br>\n<br>\nI'm still experiencing problems so my posting will still be brief, but the basics of it is that <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7144573#p7144573\">847</a> was basically a bunch of excuses for not voting Scorp. Slandaar was right that pressuring him with perhaps the most vocally influential town players in Slandaar and me would have made more sense. And using my vote on Blocky against me I still have a pretty big problem with because that was obviously a right-before-deadline compromise. If he thought firebringer was so scummy surely he would have pointed out the fact that I was supporting the firebringer lynch that day? The vote on Scorpius only comes when he kind of really doesn't have an option and as I originally pointed out and then forgot, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7153255#p7153255\">997</a> doesn't make sense as a reason to attack Scorp in that context, so feels like a scumbuddy trying to compensate for their prior lack of any real suspicion on their buddy.
