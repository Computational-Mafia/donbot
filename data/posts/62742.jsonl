Read them and then do not break them. Some of them are so important they're listed here as well, because redundancy is your friend.<br>2. Play to win. Most players want to win legitimately, don't ruin their enjoyment by playing against your wincon.<br>3. If you have the ability to edit or delete your posts in this thread, don't do it.<br>4. Do not quote anywhere any PMs between you and me (including role PMs), or anything else that originated outside of the game thread. This includes PM timestamps and anything else which games the system. Paraphrasing is allowed. If in doubt, ask.<br>5. Do not use cryptography, invisible text, tiny text, or anything like that.<br>6. Do not impersonate or pretend to be the moderator. I make and edit posts using the 0000FF tag, please do not use it.<br>7. Unless the moderator has specifically told you it is allowed, do not talk about this game outside of this game thread or PTs I provide you until I have announced that the game is over.<br>8. Do not bring outside factors into this game. This includes, among other things, making bets, promises of real life rewards, etc.<br>9. Do not use any form of provable randomness. Claiming you rolled dice and acting on that is fine. Using dice tags is not.<br>10. Pretending to break a rule will be treated the same as breaking the rule. It's up to my discretion whether I think you pretended to break or rule or not, so if you're not sure, ask first.<br>11. We're all here to have fun. Tempers may flare, but avoid personal attacks and keep it civil. I will have very little tolerance if someone complains about the way you're talking to them.<br>12. Breaking one of these rules may, at my discretion, result in a modkill. If you are modkilled, you will become a Neutral Survivor, and thus automatically lose. Modkilling may or may not end the game day.<br>13. I reserve the right to change the rules. Rule changes will be updated here as well as posted in thread.<br>14. If you are dead, that is it. Do not post. Not even a \"Bah\" post.<br>15. If I happen to not be online but you know the game is over (for example, if scum get a quicklynch in during LyLo), please let me post the final scene before revealing the ending or otherwise discussing the game.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Voting Rules</span></span><br>1. Votes must be bolded, and in the format of VOTE: Player, using either the bold or the vote tags. Abbreviations, missing punctuation, and misspellings will be accepted as long as it is obvious to me who is being voted for. IMPORTANT: If I perceive it as a vote, it counts as a vote, even if it doesn't follow these rules exactly!<br>2. Unvoting is nice, but is not necessary.<br>3. You may vote to No Lynch, that requires the same number of votes as a lynch vote.<br>4. Once a majority of votes is reached (# of players / 2 + 1, rounded down), that person is lynched.<br>5. All living players, including the lynchee, may continue to post until I lock the thread.<br><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Activity Rules</span></span><br>1. Prod system: Players who have not posted for 48 hours will be prodded; players who do not post within 24 hours of a prod will be replaced. If you were to be prodded three times over the whole game, you may be replaced at my discretion. If you have declared V/LA, you may be exempted from prods during that time at my discretion.<br>2. In the event replacements are necessary, the deadline may be extended at my discretion.<br><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Deadlines</span></span><br>1. Day will have a deadline of fourteen real life days.<br>2. Night will have a deadline of three real life days.<br>3. In the event deadline is reached before a lynch has occurred, a No Lynch occurs.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><br>Game Setup</span></span><br>This game has been approved for normalcy and balance. Normal game rules can be found <a href=\"http://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Normal_Game\" class=\"postlink\">here</a>.<br><br>It is guaranteed that at least 1 person will receive the following Vanilla Townie role PM:<br><br><fieldset style=\"border:3px outset grey; padding:5px 10px\">You are a <span style=\"color: #00BF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vanilla Townie</span></span></span>.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Abilities</span></span>:<br>-During the day, you may vote and speak.<br>-During the night, you may sleep.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Win Condition</span></span>:<br>You win when all threats to the town have been eliminated.<br><br>Game thread is <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=62742\" class=\"postlink\">here</a>.

Also when have I pushed a scum read on you? My response was \"I don't care if you read me scum\", as in this attempt of yours to do as such. I'm saying your read is completely wrong. Stop trying to mis-rep what I've said. I said my attitude is snarky even when I'm town which I am. Thus your read (Regardless of if you think you need one) is wrong. Which brings me to the point that do you have info that others don't that makes it so you don't have to have a read on someone?

My reads on Axwell and Sword Master were in fact tacked on, because I didn't really have much more to say about them at the time, other than \"hey these things flagged something for me\". I stand by my weak scumread on Axwell - He piled on a bandwagon bringing it to L-2 during RVS. He is new to games on this site, as per his own admission. It's not out of the question, in my mind, for his vote to be a newbscum move.<br><br>As for Sword Master's claim, it did read very much like a role PM quote to me. I don't think he would have been able to make up something like that himself. At this point for me he might as well be conftown. This read may of course change down the road, but based on his meta and his playstyle, I don't have much doubt he is telling the truth. I felt like it was a little game-breaking for him to do that because it seems so obviously true, but hey, if he's lying, maaaad props to Sword Master.

I found DV not explaining his vote fairly townie (mostly because I think he's picking up on the most same scumvibes I'm getting from Glass), and it's particularly common for more experienced players to do that, something which I expect Garmr to be familiar with since he's also been around this forum a while. In addition, his own explanation of his vote was also lacking, since DV is mostly saying he's not interested in detailed explanations/pushing wagons to lynch at this stage (we're what, 3 days into Day 1) and Garmr tried to spin that into DV being uninterested in getting lynches at all.<br><br>Now, I'm curious about your response. In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7086833#p7086833\">179</a> is calling for more votes, which clearly suggests he is serious about getting DV lynched, so I'm sort of wondering what more you were looking to see from him before you acted?"}

The 1% comes from is that sword is new scum and might not have been thinking things through when he fakeclaimed. <br><br>On the garmr thing i was waiting more to see if he was turning more tunnely while one post asking for votes isn't really much IMO. Also deasvail basically said \"don't really care if he's suspected at this point\" which indicates that he isn't really too interested in this lynch so I can see why gamr might find that suspicious.<br><br>One question though garmr. do you think deas as scum would have straight out said \"not really interested if he's suspected right now or not\"?<br><br>PEDIT:yep slandaar's got it in terms of sword's claim</div></blockquote> I was expecting him to panic or get agitated but not straight out say it Tbh through I didn't expect a answer that makes sense since his tone came off as uncaring  and his previous posts seemed how do i say it content with posting little contentso I'm a little confused now.<br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: deas</span>"}

Bad.<br><br>VOTE: VictorDeAgnelo</div></blockquote><br><br>It seemed fairly obvious to me that Victor's vote was as a result of not being caught up on the thread (or pretending not to be, if you swing that way), but either way it's really unlikely that lynching Sword was on the cards for him so I don't get suspecting and voting him for it at all.</div></blockquote><br><br>The Victor vote isn't a DIE DIE DIE vote, certainly not at this early stage (a benefit of the doubt you give Victor with his Sword vote, but not me...

I know I'm not alone in that belief... it just seems like an absolutely awful play if he's scum, because he'd be easily found out to be lying down the road. And the way he has played this game so far makes it seem legit as well. I'm pretty confident in believing his claim. So the obvious question, then, is why this seems to be a scumtell for you, and why you're not equally suspicious of everyone else believing Sword? Do you not believe his claim? If so, why not?<br><br>Anyway, that's just some follow-up questions I have. I look forward to your response, Deas.

I mean, I'd like to hear Deas' reasons too, but I totally get why he wouldn't want to make them obvious if he was waiting for a response from me. Any response I give with minimal reasons to respond to could, if I was scum, cause me to slip up and actually scumhunt myself. So I get it.

To me there could be more reasons to vote someone than just wanting them lynched... especially with a week and a half until deadline.

His play thus far hasn't been pro-town at all.

I don't have a town read at all in fact right now I would have him null leaning scum. His lurking also sets off a flag for me. Call it bad town play but I associate at times lurking with opportunistic scum who rather sit back &amp; watch town go to war with each other or just may not feel comfortable playing the game as scum so they don't want to give too much info to other players in the game. Blocky is very bleh right now to me.<br><br>As for the rest of the game. I'm not quite sure what to make of things. I gotta admit as a decently new player, playing outside of the newbie Q is a little overwhelming. I'm still kind of weary of Yolo. Just don't have a solid read on him. Garmr pushed on me pretty early but towards the end I was kind of getting a town vibe off of them from their scum hunting. I don't know what to make of the Scorpious/Red interaction. I still need to go back &amp; look at that &amp; their ISOs. They've been going pretty hard on each other for a few pages now. There could possibly be one between them. Glass is null for me right now, need to read more into them. DeasVail I still want to see their logic behind the vote before I make a decision as I've said before. Victor has pretty much disappeared again after being active just a tad bit. Firebringer I have a null read with a split lean. I think it could go either way . They seem to be scum hunting or at least trying. Slandaar I didn't like the vote on Sword. I was a little confused by the logic you used for voting on a un'cced PR. Was weird so I flagged it. Sword doesn't get lynched period. Should be the Night Kill &amp; there should be two kills in the night.

You honestly expected a different response to you calling me \"bad town\"? Get out of here. Your ISO further proves you've for the most part have not contributed much to the game 17 pages in with your 25 posts. Your 13, 21, &amp; 23 posts was basically nothing but fluff so you weren't replaced. Then you disappear until your 150 post where you say you like me from Garmr &amp; myself's early interaction, then proceed to place a vote on Sword with no explanation what so ever other then \"56 is scummy\". You disappear for another 30+ posts, then come back with 181, which contains a interaction where he has voted for a player who PR claimed &amp; got slammed for it. He comes out salty. Then you once again town read me as \"newb town\". You pose a close ended question to Blocky &amp; Red, then top off your posts with a vote on Garmr who you were reading scum after a vote on Deas for a read we've yet to see yet. 191, 193, &amp; 194 is basically more fluff. Weak scum hunting in 196, but you give the explanation in 205, where it seems you're trying to buddy up to Yolo who also has been pretty removed from the game. 266 brings a unexplained vote on fire but is still fluff. 267 MOAR fluff. You disappear for another 50+ posts again until you post 322 where you accuse Fire of giving a \"cop out\" answer. Then ask about your vote on him. 323 is meh. 325 not sure who you're directing that question towards. 340 was just bad, joking or not. You encourage everyone to hop on a Fire wagon because he won't answer certain questions from you.

The game previously I played with Blocky was the exact same as this game. In the previous game he hard claimed scum &amp; was mod-killed. He basically gave no content throughout the game, he never gave his own reads from his own views of the game &amp; posted so much fluff. I think Blocky has for the most part replicated that here as newb scum/uncomfortable scum. When he's mafia he sheep's reads so hard. He doesn't provide any logical reason to his votes or his reads. He never explains his reads in a logical way either."}

It would make much more sense for him to actually consider that Sword might be scum considering his investigation into the quote rule.

It's hard to tell what exactly happened since Red died in the night, or who he put his body guard on. Here's what I'm trying to understand.<br><br>Say Red put the body guard on Doctor. If scum tried to kill Doctor, then Red would die obviously. So why didn't Doctor's shot go through on me though if they were a real vigi? I'm not protected in any way.

Trying to change this is in an attempt to be read as town by you just seems really unappealing given that you're reading me based on some confident knowledge of my play and who I am as a person when it's obviously incorrect. I think Scorpious is scum and I am on his wagon. I'm not going to push hard for him to be lynched at this time because I want content from fitz first. It looks like you're going to have a problem with me scumreading Scorpious anyway since it's apparently so obvious for town to see, but by saying this and that the only reason for anyone scumreading him is being clouded by scum pushes, and nothing more, you're making any engagement with you difficult.<br><br>Firebringer I've been reading as weak town. I actually liked the way that he responded to the Blocky lynch. There was a whole lot of bravado while the Blocky wagon was happening, but then Day 2 there really is a sudden shift, and to me it seems like a genuine one based on being wrong. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7128530#p7128530\">622</a> is loads different from Day 1 and it comes across as real to me. And I like the reconsidering of reads done in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7130140#p7130140\">648</a>. The same thing occurs again in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7139726#p7139726\">792</a> so it's consistent. It is possible that this is a plan by scum and so the read is only weak, but my guess is that it's town.<br><br>My read on Fragger is less specific and more a general impression, but his thoughts are just wildly all over the place in a way that I feel is much more likely to come from town than scum. There are logical inconsistencies which I feel scum would be careful to avoid (yet I could see them from town) and it just doesn't seem like a scum-behaviour to me."}

Shouldn't that be more of a red flag?</div></blockquote><br>I am unsure why you like my scumhunting if you are town (and Gray is town)..<br><br>Refusing to answer questions isn't actually scummy. Scum are not just going to refuse to answer questions <span style=\"font-style: italic\">because</span> they are scum there will be another reason for it so find that reason and then you may have an argument. His town reason is he thinks they are pointless and I can accept that."}

Slandaar was right that pressuring him with perhaps the most vocally influential town players in Slandaar and me would have made more sense. And using my vote on Blocky against me I still have a pretty big problem with because that was obviously a right-before-deadline compromise. If he thought firebringer was so scummy surely he would have pointed out the fact that I was supporting the firebringer lynch that day? The vote on Scorpius only comes when he kind of really doesn't have an option and as I originally pointed out and then forgot, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7153255#p7153255\">997</a> doesn't make sense as a reason to attack Scorp in that context, so feels like a scumbuddy trying to compensate for their prior lack of any real suspicion on their buddy. And not too impressed today either. There's just a lot of useless almost 'trashtalk' posting on Fragger too.

Sure...any game I am in as scum (which this one would not qualify as) there is the potential that I will bus a partner for whatever reason.  The potential exists.  The fact is I have only voted out a partner once.  Years ago.  That's a pretty significant indicator in my opinion. <br><br>And Firebringer...that's 30+ games as scum.
