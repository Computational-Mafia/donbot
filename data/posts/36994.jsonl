I've played with kaze enough to know his town rvs and his schedule. He wasn't here when I expected him to be.

Okay then. And no, I do know what slashes are used for, I just assumed you disagreed with only one part of what I said (and evidently you did, seeing as you just confirmed that you were only trying to get the game rolling and not be scummy (even though that's how you really were <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\";)\" title=\"Wink\">))<br>\n2. Meh, okay</div></blockquote>\nSo this post is a load of waffle. Response to 1) is just strange. His argument seems to be (correct me if i'm wrong here, I had a hard time reading this) that I'm only disagreeing with one part of his \"orci is scum for acting scummy in order to get game moving\"...but it seems to me that if I disagree with the part where I purposely act scummy, you are left with \"orci was trying to get the game moving\" which sort of doesn't stand as a reason for scumreading me anymore, does it<br>\n<br>\nSo he does this weird backing off/termination of discussion without saying anything, leaves his vote on me, and proceeds to post fluff. I dunno. I expect people who L-1 RVS wagons to be aggressive. This was like a little rat scurrying away.

You say it's not associative but only scumMTD would avoid scumOrc wagon, scumMTD could easily jump onto townOrc wagon, townMTD could do the same in both situations of Orcs alignment.

I ended up forgetting this was a normal game and I almost screwed myself over, but luckily I turned it into a benefit and helped make myself town. Day 1, my scumreads were basically composed of Phok, Kanye, and a weaker suspicion of OmNom. I immediately started to suspect OmNom when he started answering questions for other people and became touchy around his playstyle, but I never had enough confidence to push him vocally since OmNom is hard to lynch and his \"im too different\" posts sounded somewhat genuine yet unsettling. Since he was suspect but still somewhat null, he made it to the top of my Investigate ASAP list.<br>\n<br>\nThat means Day 1 my scumreads were Phok and Kanye. At certain points in the day Orcinus slipped into them and he knows when that was, but I always tried to remind myself of his townieness earlier in the game and the fact his actions were predominantly scummy and rather just weird in my POV. Kanye basically gave himself away with his jump on MTD, I just happened to catch on to it when nobody else did. At the end of Day 1 I basically still thought Phok was the scummiest, but Kanye and OmNom were next on my list.<br>\n<br>\nGood game guys, happy my reads before my death were followed up for once <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\">", "time": "Sat Feb 08, 2014 5:21 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=36994&start=450", "forum": "53", "thread": "36994"}
