Nobody wants to be a loser.<br> 2] Do not take screenshots or directly quote any of the PMs that I send you. Doing so will result in a mod-kill. Pretending to break this rule is the same as actually breaking it. You may paraphrase, but use caution. When in doubt, run it by me first.<br> 3] Do not edit any of your posts, if you have the ability to do so.<br> 4] Do not use encrypted text, hidden text, small text, or any other hard-to-read text when posting.<br> 5] Once you have been lynched or killed, you are out of the game. Do not post anymore until the game is over. That means no \"Bah!\" posts, please.<br> 6] Do not talk about this game with anybody else outside of this thread unless your role PM explicitly says that you can.<br> 7] Heated discussion is fine, but personal attacks, insults, flaming, and poor sportsmanship are not. Please don't be a jerk to your fellow players. If I feel that your behavior is preventing other players from enjoying the game, I reserve the right to force-replace or mod-kill you.<br> 8] Do not talk about ongoing games. Like really, come on...<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #800080\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Day, Night, and Twilight:</span></span></span><br> 9] Each Day phase will last for two weeks apiece and each Night phase will last for two days. I will post specific deadlines in the game thread at the start of every Day and Night phase.<br>10] Players may continue to talk during Twilight, including the player that has been lynched.<br>11] If you do not send me your Night action before the specified deadline, I will assume that you are not performing an action on that Night. <br>12] If you know you will be unavailable during a Night phase, you may send me your night action during the preceding Day phase if you so desire.<br>13] Deadline extension requests will be considered on a case-by-case basis.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #800080\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Voting:</span></span></span><br>14] Please post all votes and unvotes using either the bold tag or the vote tag. Nicknames are fine, as long as I can understand them. Votes should look like this: <span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote:Boonskiies</span> or <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Boon</span><br>15] Unvotes are helpful, but not necessary.<br>16] Please refrain from engaging in any kind of voting trickery. If it looks like a vote, I'm counting it as a vote.<br>17] A lynch will only occur when a majority (more than 50% of all possible votes) is reached. The number of votes needed to hammer will be included with every vote count.<br>18] If a majority is not reached by the deadline, there will be no lynch on that Day.<br>19] Once a hammer occurs, no votes or unvotes will prevent the lynch from happening.<br>20] Additional votes include VOTE: No Lynch to end the Day with no lynch (which will also require a majority) and VOTE: Draw to end the game in a draw (which will require 100% agreement from all living players).<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #800080\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Activity:</span></span></span><br>21] You will be expected to post at least once every 48 hours. If you go more than 48 hours without posting, you will be prodded.<br>22] If you receive a prod, you will have 24 hours to post in the game thread. If you do not respond to your prod within 24 hours, you will be replaced. Additionally, if I have to prod you more than three times, you will be replaced.<br>23] If you know that you will have limited access to the game for more than a few days, please let me know either in the thread or via PM.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #800080\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Communication with the Moderator:</span></span></span><br>24] I may be pretty close to perfect, but I do still make mistakes every now and then. If you notice an error with the vote counts, deadlines, or anything else related to the game, please let me know and I will correct the issue.<br>25] I will not answer any role-related questions in the game thread. If you have any questions about your role, the (theoretical) roles of any other players in the game, or (theoretical) role interactions, send me a PM. Do not try to trick me into confirming a player's role. I will not be amused.<br>26] If you need to get my attention, just include @Mod or @Boon in your post. Also, bolding will help catch my eye.<br><br><span style=\"color: #800080\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Miscellaneous:</span></span></span><br>27] If you have any problems with another player, send me a PM and I will do my best to resolve the issue.<br>28] If a player is mod-killed during the Day phase, then that Day will end immediately.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #800080\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">29] My color is Purple (#800080) DON\u2019T USE IT.</span></span></span><br>30] The flavor text is for entertainment purposes only. Analyze it at your own risk.<br>31] Do not ask me to mod-kill, force-replace, or discipline any other player in the game. That is my decision to make, not yours.<br>32] As the moderator, my word is final. Please respect my instructions and my decisions.<br>33] I reserve the right to change these rules during the game if necessary. If this happens, I will inform everybody of the rule change in the thread.<br>34] In addition to these rules, all site-wide rules also apply.<br>35] Claiming color code is prohibited. <br>36] I live in California, and have Pacific Standard Time.<br><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #800080\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Sample Vanilla Townie:</span></span></span><br>37] At least one person will receive this PM.<br><br><fieldset style=\"border:3px outset grey; padding:5px 10px\">Welcome, [Player Name], you are a <span style=\"color: #00BF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vanilla Townie</span>.</span></span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #0040BF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Abilities:</span></span></span><br>\u2022 During the day, you can vote and talk<br>\u2022 You do nothing special.<br><br><span style=\"color: #0040BF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Win condition:</span></span></span><br>You win when all threats to the town have been eliminated and there is at least one town player alive.<br><br>Game thread is here.

When Massive outed their Neighbourhood I had been advocating that either the Masonry or the JK-claim had been fake. Salamence had been wagoned hard and I had been about to push that wagon to Lynch.

You all know my problems. Including the fake Mason-claim. The fact that he was unwilling to tell the truth when I clearly pointed out that either their claim or Sala's claim must be fake. Instead of that he was explaining that a Setup like that might be possible. He kept shouting at everyone next. <span style=\"font-style: italic\">Still</span>, all these things doesn't match anything I know about his scumplay I saw in my first Newbie. And that's the problem. Therefore I'm calling him <span class=\"noboldsig\">lean town</span>... for now. (His wagon needs to be examined, though.)<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Varsoon</span>. Having ISOed him again I found some concerning things. The rondo of \"f-ck that either BBM or Varsoon is scum thing\" may fit a scum-mindset that knows BBM's alignment. His BBM vote (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6953315#p6953315\">467</a>, 5th one on that wagon) is a mere sheeping of Massive. <span class=\"noboldsig\">Lean scum</span>.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">BBT</span>. What I really miss in his ISO is the good old BBT-like interrogative gamestyle. As town, he scared the shyt out of me with his questions, digging up every single thing in my posts. This is closer to his scumplay, although I may be biased because when I saw his scumplay, I was scum with him (and he performed an excellent play). Also, his attempts to narrow the lynchpool to a single Neighbourhood. If he's scum without any buddies there, that would make perfect sense. <span class=\"noboldsig\">Scummy</span>.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Pisskop</span>. Something is not right in the first part of his ISO, although I can't put my finger on it. He's also inconsistent with his cases and thoughts. What if he's constantly testing the waters with half-cases and throwing his vote on certain players? <span class=\"noboldsig\">Lean scum</span>.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Salamence</span>. I don't know what to think. His claim may or may not be real, but his gameplay changed a lot after his claim. I could imagine a town-PR with a growing fear of getting lynched as a PR...or at least, that would make sense. I wouldn't call him a good lynch Today anyway. <span class=\"noboldsig\">Lean town</span>.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">RadiantCowbells</span>. I've seen his gameplay before and trust me, he can't be sorted right now. <span class=\"noboldsig\">Unsorted</span> \u2013 later we'll know more about him.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Mainez</span>. I've forgotten about her <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6942721#p6942721\">209</a> which actually pinged me. Also <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6953944#p6953944\">473</a>... Apart from those, nothing scummy. Also, I don't think she'd push Salamence over and over and over if she were scum. <span class=\"noboldsig\">Lean town</span>.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Zebulin</span>. There's not much here. Posting style and some minor bits tell me that he's not paying attention fully. <span class=\"noboldsig\">Lean town/Null</span>.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Big Bad Null</span>. Need I try to say anything useful about him? <span class=\"noboldsig\">Null</span>.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Massive</span>. I've talked about him before. This part of my reads hasn't changed and it's way good for me on Day1. <span class=\"noboldsig\">Prob town</span>.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">EvilPacMan</span>. He was against narrowing the lynch-pool and his posts (even if there could be more posts) look genuine. I think I've seen this gameplay from him before. <span class=\"noboldsig\">Prob town</span>.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">DrDoLittle</span>. Needless to explain anything about him.<br><br>________<br><br>Let's see the BBMolla-wagon. It topped with these players: Aneninen, massive, DrDolittle, pisskop, Varsoon, Zebulin<br>DrDolittle had unvoted before Zebulin's vote.<br>Also, keep in mind that Salamence was NOT on the wagon.<br><br>Pisskop jumped off next and voted Zebulin, and Varsoon next.<br>Varsoon moved to BBT.<br>Zebulin was the next who left the wagon, he voted for Pisskop.<br>Aneninen and Massive stayed there for a long time, but before that, Pisskop returned and EPM joined. Aneninen left afterwards (Not voting), and so did Massive in the end. <br><br>It's a weird way how a wagon got dissolved but I can't see any \"scum manipulation\" there. No \"group-hopping\", no real single counterwagon.<br><br>________<br><br>TL;DR: <br>These are my reads now; from towniest to scummiest:<br>DrDolittle |||||| Massive | EPM || Mainez | Salamence | BBMolla ||| Zebulin | RadiantCowbells | Big Bad Null ||| Varsoon | Pisskop || BBT<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: BBT</span>"}

First things first, I'm not going to bring up the topics of hoods/masonries. Its all just cluttered nonsense that isn't important until we see flips, so any read that involves the reasoning that \"x is in a hood with x,\" I'm ignoring because its pointless to otherwise. Setup Specing isn't something we can do at this point either without OUTING MORE roles than we have already given scum. They already have neighbor WIFOM on town and knowledge of a JailKeeper, so maybe its best to actually scumhunt than spec right now.<br>The first thing to note rereading this thing is the argument that got the game going, the BBT wagon, which consisted of RVS votes from Aneninen, Dr.D, RC, BBB, and yeah, obviously it stopped after I (incorrectly) claimed a speedwagon L-2, when it was L-3 and well i got nothing about that, do as you will. But defending? Is it really defending? Because more and more I see it I don't see it as defending BBT because as I said earlier, I didn't have a read on BBT other than it suddenly picked up alot of votes, especially lackluster ones from BBT and RC, who both were my scumreads at that point, more on them later. Back to the game, if you look back from the time I claimed BBT wagon L-2, and my next post, nothing but boring fluff from PK and RC mainly, (a little bit of actually hunting between massive/BBT for what its worth. Dr. D asked me if the wagon (built a little too fast for my liking) was justified, and no its not. I personally think it still was a fast banwagon and 1-2 scum probably lulz their way into it. I'm willing to bet my life savings into saying the obviously annoying RC and the equally as annoying PK are not scum together for sure. Also the OMGUS from RC was cute because my vote is \"Nonsense,\" and dumb (fluffy) justification of her vote by saying she catches scum all the time based on OMGUS, and frankly I don't believe it.<br> <br>You know what, lets talk about RC right now, because RC's 77 posts (should have been more if not for V/LA), are soooo dull and anti productive. The first post from RC that actually has some non-RVS content (IMO) would be her TWENTY THIRD POST! #136, where she votes me. 24-30 are nothing. 31, votes varsoon because shes a troll, then an hour later votes me again. I call her out on it, and that for some reason indicates me being scum because RC wants to run around doing whatever she wants. Votes come in from Mainez and Varsoon, Mainez is chainsawing RC, and Varsoon is following the IC. Dr.D comes in with some trolling, and right after comes RC with another one of her dumb \"watering down the fucking thread\" posts that do nothing but make the game a pain in the ass to reread. IDK what to think about EPM's vote, but it bugs me and smells like an excuse to hop on the ML. PK, oh god PK, we will get to him last, but let me just say he has thrown games for town when I played the last time with him a few weeks ago. BBT ready to hammer just like that, showing how speedwagons work, but whatever, I out a PR, gg folks. Then we have some interaction from PK and BBT over the claim, which, idk, I tend to ignore PK doing things because hes annoying. PK then votes BBT and BBT votes me again, after 2 pages of arguing over the claim because... Mainez said so? WTF?<br><br>Then Anen goes into the masons/IC setup spec which is stupid because outting masons is pro-town, even if they are lying. YOU DONT LYNCH PRs UNLESS YOU HAVE A CC. THE FUCKING END. BBT thinks Mainez is JK, and if so, then you out and you get a mafia. I know that aint the case though, so why you think she is, I have no fucking clue. BBT goes out to ruin the game by outing hoods because fuck this game. BBB is dumb, who cares. EPM is dumb as fuck for unvoting and not voting a hood member even though he says he needs to deal with the hood situation (Because there is no such thing as a all-town hood). FOR FUCK SAKE THE NEXT PAGES ARE DUMB SHIT BY BBT/RC/PK ABOUT HOODS AND HOOD LYNCHING. THIS IS ANTI-TOWN AND SHOULD BE NOTED AS SUCH. FOR FUCK SAKE THIS GAME WILL HAVE 200 PAGES IF THIS DOESNT CHANGE FUCK. BBMolla goes over some spec himself that doesnt help anyone, but apparently that and his mason fakeclaim, which isn't stupid as I have seen it before, get him lolwagoned now, INCLUDING A NAKED VOTE FROM PK AND AN OMGUS FROM VARSOON OR BBT WTF!!!!!!! oh wait, he changed it to Molla, perfect.<br><br>Molla is town. End of story, no scum is gonna spend a shitload of time on meta'ing his fucking fakeclaim, and I said it before, I have NEVER NEVER NEVER EVER seen Molla freak the fuck out, and I have a cop guilty on his ass, and he still acted like he didn't give a fuck. Molla is town. End of story.<br>Mainez and PK still piss me off.<br><br>ZEB Molla vote, fuck man. Yeah, thats willing of a vote.<br>Even with town Molla on Varsoons wagon, just not feeling it.<br>EPM's scumread on Molla for calling everyone morons was dumb."}

Molla, I know you know I know going along with the mason claim is something you would do but you've still given no explanation whatsoever for why it was a good idea or potentially helpful in any way to backup Varsoon's fake claim. Not to mention you've largely turned around your read on him while his posting has steadily improved and don't seem to have considered it'd be really REALLY dumb and pointless for scum with next to no suspicion on him to fakeclaim mason.

You say I'm setting up neighborhood wifom but several of these posts are completely unrelated and there's definitely no trail of me using the neighborhood to argue some kind of circular logic. So either you don't know what wifom means or you're misrepping me and I think it's the latter since the first two posts were before we even knew there were mulitiple neighborhoods iirc and the latter posts are not even about the hoods, they're about the mason fakeclaims. And 687 was a legitimate question to Dolittle because I didn't understand his post?? Did you even read context or did you just find the word \"neighborhood\" in my iso a couple of times, quote the posts, and make stuff up about them?"}

I'm a two shot JK, one of the worst fucking wifom roles in the fucking game.<br><br>Mafia had to NK N1 unless you believe PK was the night target vs. me or IC. I already explained earlier how I didn't target the IC because I needed to hit mafia that night otherwise mafia would have killed me. The fact there was a NK made me think Piss did it, hence why I voted him.<br><br>Today, there was another No-kill, which means scum are getting boned or they targeted IC last night. I targeted IC because I was afraid if I got the wrong person again, the IC would be dead and I would be at fault.<br><br>Another reason I wasn't a night kill target was because flashwagons are fun. RC is dumb, EPM is scum, Mainez is fucking scum, and really, most people who wanted to follow the IC around when he was voting me, aren't willing to follow him today? That's odd.<br><br>Anyways, if I have to go, I have to go. Just know I'm flipping town JK, and I expect Mainez lynched as fast as she wants me to.<br><br>Mainez is scum. Tunneling a claimed PR D1 is fucking stupid, especially since there is not one mention of anyone else as her scumreads and only names the people voting me as town (obviously never heard of bussing). This goes on for the entirety of D1, this death tunnel on a claimed PR is not healthy given that ITS DAY 1. Mainez also scumreads Zeb late but doesn't vote him and tries to force NL. #1272, she says she will vote Zeb, never does. I give her the opportunity to pull a lynch on Zeb with less than a day remaining, and instead of hammering, bitches about how my vote is scummy, DESPITE THE FACT WE WERE RUNNING OUT OF FUCKING TIME. Mainez withholds information during D2 (1425) and still hasn't brought this up today. Odd to think she knows she is living another day. And the rest of her iso is the same shit: RC is town for voting Sala earlier, Everyone needs to death tunnel sala, ect.<br><br>When I flip town, this needs to die. This needs to be flashwagoned and destroyed, no matter what.<br><br>Another person that would be scum with Mainez is EPM. I mentioned in my catch up post D1 that EPM votes molla for drawing the night kill by \"lying\" about the masonry. He did establish neighborhood wifom with his on again off again reading of people inside the hoods, and I disagree with his meatworld meta check of BBM, who I believe to be town. He was one of the people to vote Anen instead of Piss, who at the time was more guilty. <br><br>Hes another good choice for mafia.<br><br>In general it looks like this:<br><br>Dr. D<br>BBMolla<br><br>TSO<br>Varsoon<br>Massive<br><br>BBT<br>RC (he and PK can't both be town running amuck, right?)<br><br>EPM<br>Mainez"}

Or, at least, when I read it, it didn't make sense to me at the time. I just looked at Mainez's ISO back there, and looked at the vote counts, and it seemed like the suspicion on Salamence faded away fairly quickly once we got back into the neighborhood fog. Afterwards, Mainez was shouting like a broken record but I wouldn't have connected it back to your post. And apparently no one else was listening to her either.<br><br>I like that Mainez stayed on Salamence all of D1 even after everyone has abandoned her. That's a point not to be overlooked."}

LOL. ok so i wrote a bunch of shit and chose TSO. i didn't jailkeep salamence cause i found it meaningless, it didn't occur to me that he'll make the kill. and as mentioned earlier, i wasn't 100% sure he was scum so yea i left him alone.<br><br>come to night 2, i was 100% sure salamence is scum after he stupidly claimed to jailkeep pisskop (which is uh plain weird) and pisskop flipped town so uh yea. furthermore, salamence was the one who casually hammered aneninen. i chose to jailkeep salamence because i was pretty sure he'll be making the kill and also claim to have jailkept DrDolittle because that's so reasonable and expected of a jailkeeper right? <br><br>i'm gonna sleep now. and i'm pretty sure the thread will be locked when i'm awake. i'm also pretty sure i won't survive the night so all the best town! i suggest looking at the vote counts from the start as well as salamence ISO. which actually, well, all town will do right lol. i'll take a last look at what i wanna look and post if there's anything i find noteworthy."}

If it's just our neighborhood? Then it's likely BBmolla is the scum, with tagging along with your mason claim blindly and then trying his own reverse gambit after being called on it.

Scum have already shown that they aren't going to succumb to \"gambits trying to draw the kill\"; they ignored both you and BBmolla (who fakeclaimed doctor even!) to try and kill TSO N1. Varsoon's gambit N3 wasn't to try and draw the nightkill because any lynch proves it was fake. I practically had to stop BBmolla from claiming in the neighborhood to prevent him from \"testing\" Varsoon's fake PR. Varsoon's gambit was followed by him immediately voting Mainez -- so the answer HAS to be Varsoon was trying to save Salamence, figuring that (a) if town lynched Mainez, he still had Salamence as confscum to lynch D4 and (b) if town lynched Sala, he could shout about how he was trying to draw the nightkill and hope that the town would just ignore the boy who cried wolf one more time.<br><br>So yeah.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Varsoon</span>"}

First things first, I'm not going to bring up the topics of hoods/masonries. Its all just cluttered nonsense that isn't important until we see flips, so any read that involves the reasoning that \"x is in a hood with x,\" I'm ignoring because its pointless to otherwise. Setup Specing isn't something we can do at this point either without OUTING MORE roles than we have already given scum. They already have neighbor WIFOM on town and knowledge of a JailKeeper, so maybe its best to actually scumhunt than spec right now.<br>The first thing to note rereading this thing is the argument that got the game going, the BBT wagon, which consisted of RVS votes from Aneninen, Dr.D, RC, BBB, and yeah, obviously it stopped after I (incorrectly) claimed a speedwagon L-2, when it was L-3 and well i got nothing about that, do as you will. But defending? Is it really defending? Because more and more I see it I don't see it as defending BBT because as I said earlier, I didn't have a read on BBT other than it suddenly picked up alot of votes, especially lackluster ones from BBT and RC, who both were my scumreads at that point, more on them later. Back to the game, if you look back from the time I claimed BBT wagon L-2, and my next post, nothing but boring fluff from PK and RC mainly, (a little bit of actually hunting between massive/BBT for what its worth. Dr. D asked me if the wagon (built a little too fast for my liking) was justified, and no its not. I personally think it still was a fast banwagon and 1-2 scum probably lulz their way into it. I'm willing to bet my life savings into saying the obviously annoying RC and the equally as annoying PK are not scum together for sure. Also the OMGUS from RC was cute because my vote is \"Nonsense,\" and dumb (fluffy) justification of her vote by saying she catches scum all the time based on OMGUS, and frankly I don't believe it.<br> <br>You know what, lets talk about RC right now, because RC's 77 posts (should have been more if not for V/LA), are soooo dull and anti productive. The first post from RC that actually has some non-RVS content (IMO) would be her TWENTY THIRD POST! #136, where she votes me. 24-30 are nothing. 31, votes varsoon because shes a troll, then an hour later votes me again. I call her out on it, and that for some reason indicates me being scum because RC wants to run around doing whatever she wants. Votes come in from Mainez and Varsoon, Mainez is chainsawing RC, and Varsoon is following the IC. Dr.D comes in with some trolling, and right after comes RC with another one of her dumb \"watering down the fucking thread\" posts that do nothing but make the game a pain in the ass to reread. IDK what to think about EPM's vote, but it bugs me and smells like an excuse to hop on the ML. PK, oh god PK, we will get to him last, but let me just say he has thrown games for town when I played the last time with him a few weeks ago. BBT ready to hammer just like that, showing how speedwagons work, but whatever, I out a PR, gg folks. Then we have some interaction from PK and BBT over the claim, which, idk, I tend to ignore PK doing things because hes annoying. PK then votes BBT and BBT votes me again, after 2 pages of arguing over the claim because... Mainez said so? WTF?<br><br>Then Anen goes into the masons/IC setup spec which is stupid because outting masons is pro-town, even if they are lying. YOU DONT LYNCH PRs UNLESS YOU HAVE A CC. THE FUCKING END. BBT thinks Mainez is JK, and if so, then you out and you get a mafia. I know that aint the case though, so why you think she is, I have no fucking clue. BBT goes out to ruin the game by outing hoods because fuck this game. BBB is dumb, who cares. EPM is dumb as fuck for unvoting and not voting a hood member even though he says he needs to deal with the hood situation (Because there is no such thing as a all-town hood). FOR FUCK SAKE THE NEXT PAGES ARE DUMB SHIT BY BBT/RC/PK ABOUT HOODS AND HOOD LYNCHING. THIS IS ANTI-TOWN AND SHOULD BE NOTED AS SUCH. FOR FUCK SAKE THIS GAME WILL HAVE 200 PAGES IF THIS DOESNT CHANGE FUCK. BBMolla goes over some spec himself that doesnt help anyone, but apparently that and his mason fakeclaim, which isn't stupid as I have seen it before, get him lolwagoned now, INCLUDING A NAKED VOTE FROM PK AND AN OMGUS FROM VARSOON OR BBT WTF!!!!!!! oh wait, he changed it to Molla, perfect.<br><br>Molla is town. End of story, no scum is gonna spend a shitload of time on meta'ing his fucking fakeclaim, and I said it before, I have NEVER NEVER NEVER EVER seen Molla freak the fuck out, and I have a cop guilty on his ass, and he still acted like he didn't give a fuck. Molla is town. End of story.<br>Mainez and PK still piss me off.<br><br>ZEB Molla vote, fuck man. Yeah, thats willing of a vote.<br>Even with town Molla on Varsoons wagon, just not feeling it.<br>EPM's scumread on Molla for calling everyone morons was dumb.</div></blockquote></div></div></div><br>He's pretty intent on insisting that he wasn't defending BBT as opposed to increasing the certainty of his townread on BBT as scum usually do when they defend a townie so that makes me lean more towards BBT-scum.<br><br>Also, his insistence on policy-lynching RC makes RC pretty town."}

So I figured I was better off looking at Varsoon and trying to figure out if his actions made sense from one alignment or the other.<br><br>----<br><br>Why does scum-Varsoon fakeclaim mason blindly? Well why not, it's not like anything bad can happen to him. But why? What's he hoping to gain immediately at that time? It comes when RC states he's trying to \"sort [Varsoon]'s alignment\" and serves to fend RC off. It also comes right after a vote for Sala (in a string of votes for Sala) that no one seems interested in justifying. (The way RC and Varsoon vote together onto Sala and then Varsoon fakes the mason claim to put RC off ... they aren't scum together.) <br><br>Why does town-Varsoon fakeclaim mason blindly? He claims it's to draw the nightkill. With an IC already announced, it seems unlikely that Varsoon immediately jumps to the top of the scum target list. If you put in context of trying to swerve RC's attention -- is there a town reason to do this? <br><br>----<br><br>Why does scum-Varsoon fakeclaim rolecop? Obvious answer is \"to save Sala and get Mainez lynched\" but ... assume he gets that outcome. Sala gets lynched D4 (8p) and Varsoon then has to actually fight to survive D5 (6p). Best play then, I guess, is to seed reasons for being wrong (which he does in 1910), but he needs to be very careful about reading the room and NOT getting too much attention, especially when it looks like Sala is the lynch and not Mainez. (He does that too, bailing to vote Sala despite his own \"results\" in 1921 and promising to \"recheck Mainez\" in 1927.) <br><br>Why does town-Varsoon fakeclaim rolecop? I have no earthly idea. His argument is still \"trying to draw the kill\" and yet there's still an IC out there. (Not to mention that, with Sala lynched, Mainez is the obvious kill that night.) <br><br>----<br><br>Why does scum-Varsoon fakeclaim even-night cop in the neighborhood? Molla is arguably townreading him and I make it clear to him in the neighborhood that I'm not buying any of his dumb fakeclaims any more. How is a third fakeclaim going to help him here? Especially if he intends to kill Molla that night anyways? I actually think he screwed the pooch here -- Molla's been biting on his fakeclaims all game, but when Molla reacts to Varsoon's claimed N4 action (to cop Molla) with \"just cop EPM and 1v1 him\" I think he realized he might have weakened Molla's townread on him. It obviously doesn't matter how I react, since I've been reacting the same all game.<br><br>Why does town-Varsoon fakeclaim even-night cop in the neighborhood? If it's \"to draw the nightkill,\" why does he tie his N2 result (Mainez, inno) back to the D3 fakeclaim and horror show? Why make it obviously fake and push the \"oh no I shouldn't have said anything in this chat\" aspect of it? Molla's going to townread him and I'm going to think his claims are bull. This one isn't going to change either of our minds. And if Varsoon thinks one of is scum, then this certainly isn't making it any MORE likely that he actually has a PR."}

I enjoyed modding this game, but I feel my personal style as a moderator just doesn't work well with neighborhoods. <br><br>I feel my niche as a Normal game moderator comes from being unique, even within the Normal guidelines, and I don't feel this game had enough of that \"Boonskiies Spice\" to it. I promise to make my Large Normal extra spicy for that reason, so feel free to /in for that; I probably will send you all PM's promoting it when it comes closer.
