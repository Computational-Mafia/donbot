If rack is scum and wasn't actually reaction testing, but was actually trying to paint Tammy as scum and then switch direction when it wasn't working, I don't see a good reason for rack to have claimed that Tammy had meta that made her scummy when rack didn't actually have any meta like that.

His vote against Phokdapolees in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6125126#p6125126\">66</a> is based upon a really weak thing: Phok's interpretation on their joke (with Tammy). Not getting a joke is a null in itself, in my opinion. In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6125131#p6125131\">67</a> he pushes Rack (that's viable), in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6125308#p6125308\">75</a> he told that Rack had wanted to be playful. (How exactly, I think.) In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6126822#p6126822\">92</a> he \"attacks\" Phok's vote for Rack. For sure, Phok's argument wasn't a strong one but it has been far not the weakest in this thread so far. In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6128235#p6128235\">119</a> he protects Rack yet again, <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">\"If he says he's played with Tammy before, he probably has and he's a confirmed alt as well\"</div> (though in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6125131#p6125131\">67</a> he wanted a reference from Rack). In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6130580#p6130580\">149</a> he left alone Phokdapolees &#8211; I think he had realized that that wagon hadn't been moving. That post has very little content. Here he brought up yet again that Rock hadn't given references about Tammy. (Yet another contradiction.) I don't know why Rack's MalaKitty vote was town in his opinion. At the end of the post Flame brought up (in my opinion) real scumtells against Rack but for that he needn't have made a long quote with \"playful/seem town/etc\" before that.<br>\nIn general, he is producing inconsistent and \"it looks as if it contained more information than it contains\" posts (unless I've seriously skimmed over something) and I usually consider this a scumread. <br>\n<br>\n2. Implosion hasn't got a free pass, he's on the lean town tier with many other players. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6125145#p6125145\">68</a> would get a similar read from me as Rack's post since he talked about Tammy without giving a reference but he gave one in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6125167#p6125167\">71</a> (town/null tell, unsure). I agree with <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6125157#p6125157\">70</a> on the other hand (so, a minor town vibe for that). Apart from the vote <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6128168#p6128168\">115</a> looks like a genuine one; he must have thought for real about those things (on the other hand, I'm not sure about the conclusion of him). <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6134470#p6134470\">208</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6134487#p6134487\">209</a> seem to be genuine list-reads (even if I disagree with some of those reads). (His next post is a mere recapitulation, no new info there). However, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6135971#p6135971\">226</a> is a WTF. That question went for me, didn't it?<br>\n<br>\n3. Phokdapolees. Missing a joke is a null. The \"lean town\" read is more-or-less a gut read: the way the tried to explain himself (eg. about the joke) felt townish. I think he tries to get reads but he fails to get good bits.

Last time this happened, there was one actual cop in the last ten completed mini normals (and it was in a game that was modded by the half of the hydra who claimed cop). A cursory look suggests the meta may have changed (it was in 2 of the last 5). So eh. Idk. I guess this point doesn't hold much merit itg. I also have less intuition of mod meta than I did in that game. Tammy was also in that game (it's the game I linked when displaying her town meta).<br>\n<br>\nAnyway, back to actual points (and Oso's question). I'm at least less convinced than I was in that other game. But does it make sense for a cop to softclaim? Hell no. Cops are often in games where scum has some way to deal with the cop.

He made his first post which looked rather scummy, and now I just got what he meant by I was bussing a wagon in my first post.  I was the second vote on Malakittens, lol, when I started my post Elias hadn't posted yet and I was always going to vote Malakittens.  I've been trying to figure out what the hell he was talking about.  Actually his reads don't make any sense with his third quote in this very post.  He's using things that aren't even a glimmer in a scum tells eye to claim people are scummy.  For instance, he said that flames was scummy for being the fourth vote on someone before they posted.  ERM yeah okay bud.<br>\n<br>\nAnyway, I just don't see a cop making this post to me.  He made a scummy post and I voted him.  He had already given me scum points for playing mafia, so I don't get the response at all.  What is also amusing is he's saying that he's leaning towards voting me when he's only read three pages of the game, which is increasing my suspicion that he designated me as a scum read when he started reading the game.  But why would you make this post if you were a cop?  If you're a cop, and you have this strong suspicion I'm scum, even if you're worried your suspicion is going to get taken less seriously because it could be perceived as omgus, you're a cop.  You get to investigate me.  Hurrah.

I would have had a slight scum read myself on Flames, but not more than you or Rack. Especially not enough to put him at L-1. Then again, I'm still on page 6 so that could change. If he ran his slot up as scummy as possible and replaced out again, I'm going to be fucking furious. This is why he's already blacklisted by several people here. And honestly, depending on my finished conclusion after my read through, if that's what he did, I'm going to call for a mod kill. That's against our town win-condition, and in the end, it fucks the town really badly considering our role.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nWhy didn't he claim here?  I didn't realize that he was at L-2 when I voted, but for all he knew I was going to keep my vote there.  And seriously he's a cop who's going to call for a modkill if flames looks like he looked scummy on purpose?  Seriously?<br>\n<br>\nAlso the bolded strikes me as off with his reads.  If I were the scum he's pushing me as, I wouldn't be reading him.  I would be fake reading him.  And if he actually thought my RVS vote on Malakittens was opportunistic, why not think this is opportunistic?  (I don't like this tell tooooo much, it's basically the \"you're talking to me like I'm town\" tell, and a lot of the time when I see this used it's against town as town aren't ever sure.  It just reads off to me because I'm his biggest \"suspect\" at this point.  We've never played together before, I think the only experience we have is him replacing into a slot into a game after I'd replaced out, so it can't be familiarity talking.

{"number": 438, "id": "6156192", "user": "Tammy", "user_id": "18197", "content": "Okay was able to sit down and get caught up.  woooo.  If I don't make sense here and there, don't mind me I'm still on very little sleep.  Anyway, I'm going to be quick and brief because I still have a lecture to finish writing and other stuff to do.<br>\n<br>\nI still like my town reads for the most part.  If Neil comes back scum, I think I'll feel even better about Agar as it doesn't feel like a bus.  I think.  Well that's how I feel right now.<br>\n<br>\nI'm not entirely sure what Malakittens sees in tman though.  He is null territory and sometimes what she says pings seems a bit nitpicky.<br>\n<br>\nNot a fan of Neil though.  I really don't know how he can have the reads he has, like at all.  He feels like scum who thought I'd be an easy push so went for it; his tone is just so eh.  Some things are just funny though, and I refuse to believe that someone with any amount of experience in this game is reading it the way he is and is town, especially after looking through his meta a bit.  He actually has thoughtful reads, which demonstrate an attempt to solve the game, and I'm not seeing that here.  Like the things he makes a big deal out of concerning me are things I don't accept he actually thinks.  He said I had no good reason to call myself town in my first post.  Well I do have good reason, it's called a town role pm.  He has played with people who declare they're town in their first post before and not made a deal of it.  <br>\n<br>\nHe's also not new, so should understand that early bandwagons happen, they can tell you a lot about the person being wagoned and who's voting, and he's characterizing my very obvious joke votes as something serious.  Like literally I claimed that my cat told me to vote flames in rvs and then thanked malakittens for confessing.  I don't understand how anyone could think those were serious votes and I was just going for \"anything that would stick\".  <br>\n<br>\nOh you know what was funny?  He considered that Implosion made the only sound post on page one and liked him for it.  On page one, Neil was scum reading me; Implosion made a joke about me and claimed I was town.  Now how in the hell does someone town reading his big suspect garner him the most thoughtful post of the page?  <br>\n<br>\nHis read on phok and tman are complete crap as well.  Actually I find that people who are unwilling to change their mind when their argument has been proven incorrect to be more likely scum.  Scum tend to stick to early reads even when they're pointed out for crap reasons, not town.  So when someone scum reads you, and they're told they completely misinterpreted everything and decides the person is still scum, it's more likely scum not town sticking to their guns.  <br>\n<br>\nTman's pointing out that I had called myself town several times does not in any way shape or form demonstrate someone who is reading the game and is pointing out motivations.  It's a null tell.  It's also something that scum can very easily do to look like they're scum hunting.  Oh she called herself town too many times, that's scummy.  And for Neil to be all \"oh I didn't know if anyone would notice it\" I mean what?  Town and scum have come after me for calling myself town before.  It's never stopped me from calling myself town!  (What I think makes him look town from the affair is that it looks to me like Rack said this was my scum meta, not long after that Tman pulled up posts where I'm referring to myself being town and says it looks like a joke but do I do it often.  Considering that was the most of what I did do, it makes sense that if someone says hey she's scum by meta, he'd go looking.  It looks like he took Tman's accusation seriously and went looking for what could make me scum.  That's something that I'd expect more from town trying to figure out the game than from scum who would know that Rack was lying.)<br>\n<br>\nOh the Rack thing is crap as well.  I mean obviously I know I'm town and this is my town meta, cuz you know kind of an expert on me, so when he said that I was definitely scum by meta, I knew that there was something else there.  Neil trying to claim that I was invalidate his opinion by calling out what he was doing is pure bullshit.  Of course I was trying to figure out what he was doing with that.  He says it's interesting I called out Rack's lie before he admitted it.  UM you usually know when someone is lying about you.  (You slept with my boyfriend.  No, I didn't that's a lie.  How do you know it's a lie?!?!?!?  Y'all must have planned it GOTCHA)  Also, if anyone thinks that's a planned reaction test, they must be on serious crack.  I just don't believe he believes his conclusion.  What I am concerned about here is that Rack is his partner, and he's trying to tie me to his partner.<br>\n<br>\nOh also whoever is scum reading Rack for claiming that he lied about my meta in order to find a reason to get off of my wagon, that's a bad reason to be voting Rack.  Things don't work that way and it's a complete null tell.  Rack would have never been able to get by with voting me and causing a wagon based on my meta anyway.  As a brief site search would have netted anyone who looked the exact opposite view of me.  Not only that but Implosion had already mentioned playing with me, and I think it was obvious that Agar and Malakittens have experience with me too.  Rack was either doing exactly what he said he was doing...reaction testing.  Or he was scum pretending to reaction test.  But jumping off my wagon because this isn't my scum meta doesn't make him scum.  Rack could have potentially been reaction testing me as well, but it does not work so well when it's in the beginning of the game and I don't know who you are.<br>\n<br>\nI was going to point out that Neil hadn't mentioned chaos lord at all, but his last catch up post reached page five and chaos didn't post until page 6.<br>\n<br>\nThe only thing that worries me with my Neil read is that I feel like I'm getting overly involved in his read on me and just how shit it is.  I'd probably feel better about his read on me if he was a newb or a VI, but reading through his games today he's just not so I don't believe the tells he's using.  I more feel like he thought I'd be an easy target.<br>\n<br>\nMy other biggest suspect besides Neil is chaos lord.  He just feels like he's trying to look involved in the game but really isn't trying to figure out the game.<br>\n<br>\nI have the same feeling with Elias though.  He also still didn't answer my question why it was wifom for my tell with Rack.  It's my tell, and unless Rack had been in a game with me where I used that tell to call someone town, then it can't be wifom.  And really it would be silly in the first place.  it's like he's trying to argue that Rack went oh Tammy thinks unhelpful people tend to be town so I'm going to claim to have meta and then refuse to answer because then Tammy will call me town for refusing to answer.  And that wasn't the point I was making in the first place, considering I ended up calling it a null town.  Oh also scum aren't more preservationists than town.  Some people hate getting mislynched worse than correctly lynched.  I feel like Elias is focusing on the wrong thing there, and asked me a question about it just to do it.  It felt like busy work.  <br>\n<br>\nOkay I really need to write this lecture for tomorrow, and I promised this would be brief and LIED!", "time": "Wed Aug 27, 2014 2:04 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=58816&start=425", "forum": "53", "thread": "58816"}

The wagon on Rack started day 1 with an RVS vote, and grew in just a few days. In that timeframe, and the time since the Flame wagon started, everyone has been posting, and there's been more content to scrutinize.\"</div>. (Though, there is a small error in his logic: The Flames wagon was started with a RVS vote too, Agar never changed his vote on Day1.)<br>\n<br>\nBefore the replacement, the wagon was (Agar, Implosion, Aneninen, Tman, Shadowez), <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6144451#p6144451\">300</a>. Tammy joined for a short while, Implosion and Shadowez jumped off afterwards. <br>\n<br>\nMind the fact, that at this point of the game Neil had 3 (and 4, after Phok) votes, while there were two 2-votes-wagons, Rack and Tman. Phokdapolees joined and Implosion rejoined, Chaos put Neil at L&#8211;1 afterwards. Anyone of them, especially Phok could have jumped on any of the counterwagons. Phok had never been on this wagon before, so I think that's a very strong towntell. Implosion's a bit strange, but the post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6146144#p6146144\">333</a> <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">\"The very first thing I find when I look at neil's meta leads me to believe he has a history of fakeclaiming as town.\"</div> seems to be genuine. (Or at least, I did a similar thing later, on Day1). A moderately strong towntell on him. Chaos' vote would have been an unnecessarry bussing if he were scum. Though, it's possible that he jumped on because he felt that Neil would go down. Still, a mild towntell. <br>\nAnd who jumped off the wagon in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6146850#p6146850\">344</a>?

Neil claimed Cop in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6154588#p6154588\">386</a>, Aneninen and Implosion jumped off next.

Your posting it did nothing but pad your post count and feign town interest in a position when it became clear that Neil's gambit was going to bear no fruits. Neil claimed in 386. Anen made his post in 390. You posted in 389 and did NOT feel it necessary then to say \"Don't counterclaim.\" 394 tman says \"Don't CC.\" 395 Mala says \"He's fishing for the real cop.\" 396 Tammy says \"Don't cc.\" Post 401 you finally say \"Don't CC.\" 3 other people said it before you. Another person expressed disbelief in Neil's claim. But you wait until they come in and then ride the popular opinion of \"Don't CC!\" Again, like before - it wasn't your first instinct to say \"Don't claim!\" You waited until you got reactions.

First, I'm just going to go through my townreads and what I feel most makes them town. If they're a wide a townread, I'll probably be quite minimal.<br>\n<br>\nAGar: Pushed Flames wagon from start to end. No other problems with him. Generally quite town. Cool.<br>\n<br>\nMalakittens: First to say she didn't believe neil's claim. If she was willing to be so bus-heavy as scum I think she would have actually gotten on the wagon. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6154724#p6154724\">392</a> would have to be very clever to come from scum. Possible, but unlikely. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6154998#p6154998\">413</a> feels unlikely to come from scum due to fear of being accused of lining up lynches.<br>\n<br>\nImplosion: His vote made the difference between Flames being AGar's scumread and being an actual wagon. Concerns relating to neil's alignment come across as genuine, because if scum he's already decided to bus. There is no point in scum-implosion unvoting and pondering about the lynch when it doesn't do anything to change the lynch target and may cause others to suspect him after the flip.<br>\n<br>\nPhok: Voting for Tammy after AGar &amp; implosion express high confidence in her being town is brave for scum, but probably doesn't achieve much at all. His reaction to criticisms of his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6127078#p6127078\">98</a> make me townread him since he kind of clearly doesn't care. Also Flames' push of him is a +.<br>\n<br>\nTman2nd: I thought he was quite viable scum for a long time, but this all changes with <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6146850#p6146850\">344</a>. If tman2nd is scum with neil, there is no point in unvoting. The townies are dead-set on his lynch at this stage, there is no real reason to believe that he won't be lynched. It only draws attention that scum would not want. For town though, who don't know neil's alignment, it's totally reasonable and makes sense.<br>\n<br>\nRack: Never thought he was scum really. Reaction test thing is totally crazy and therefore more likely from town imo.<br>\n<br>\n~~<br>\n<br>\nAneninen: Slightly weaker townread than the others but still a townread. I find his personality makes it difficult to assess his alignment as he sometimes does things that I usually would find scummy, but I suspect that these may be more of a personality thing than anything else. Most concerning for me is the part I quoted earlier from <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6134608#p6134608\">212</a>, because why say that people should keep an eye on you if you're town? Seems more likely scum would say it just to appear reasonable. However, Aneninen often does things such as call his own posts weak, so I question the validity of my point. His vote on Flames comes a little early, but not too early for scum. However, the call-out for cop counterclaims after neil's own claim, this being after negative responses to the claim, just feels way out there for scum, and is the main reason why I townread this slot despite my concerns.<br>\n<br>\n~~<br>\n<br>\nShaddowez: Mostly a PoE read. His play in regards to flames/neil is nothing beyond scum as far as I can see. The main thing holding me back though, as silly as it may sound, is <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6123557#p6123557\">21</a>. Notice the similarity in style of RVS to flames, while everyone else is different. I feel scum may make more effort to do something different from a buddy, but I consider this point quite weak after some thought. I didn't notice anything scummy in particular during my read-through, but I haven't reviewed the most recent case on him properly and will read his own posts more deeply tomorrow.<br>\n<br>\nOso: Nothing that's really town about him, but nothing all that scummy either? It's really hard to say for me, as his posts are quite odd at times. Another I will need to look further into.<br>\n<br>\nChaoslord: His read progression on the neill/flames scumslot seems pretty unnatural as well as being likely to be what scum would do there imo. He starts off thinking flames is town, ignores the flames wagon until specifically asked, where he then makes an awkward wishy-washy post not really saying anything but trying not to get Flames lynched <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6138588#p6138588\">256</a>. However, in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6146651#p6146651\">339</a> he then goes into 'bus my buddy' mode and despite quite strongly townreading flames, he lets nothing get in the way of his new 'scumread', which I feel is unrealistic for town, but matches scum that has decided neill is going down.<br>\n<br>\nReads are still a bit shonky in parts (Oso in particular), but hopefully this will be fixed soon. I'm not going to vote yet because I need to look further into Oso and Shaddowez, but chaoslord is my preferred lynch right now.", "time": "Tue Sep 02, 2014 1:51 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=58816&start=475", "forum": "53", "thread": "58816"}

It was your initial entrance. That speaks a lot louder than afterwords when you either had time to say \"Oh shit, that was dumb!\" or a scumbuddy possibly told you. The point is a town player's first mindset isn't \"Oh let me not contribute!\" If it is, they're bad.</fieldset><br>\nNice dichotomy you have going there. A couple of them actually. Putting aside what you think proper entrance play for a replacement is, how exactly would a scumbuddy have told me I was screwing up?<br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\n@Aneninen. Couple of points there I'll go ahead and answer.<br>\n<br>\nMala tied Chaos being scum with Niel being scum. That question was me wondering if she had anything independent of Niel's alignment to base Chaos' alignment on. Her saying she'd re-evaluate if Niel was the cop, told me she was using an association rather than what she considered solid evidence. I'd still like to know why she thinks they are connected though.<br>\n<br>\nI had made it clear that I would hammer Niel. But I also wanted both Shadowez and Agar post their thoughts before it happened. They were the only two who had been on the wagon pre-claim that hadn't posted their thoughts on the claim after Neil made it. I couldn't guarantee that would happen but I could help make it happen by not voting. I point to Mala's requesting the Hammer a couple of times and the whole mood was leaning lynch Neil. If he had gotten to L-1 again, I was afraid there would be a hammer (not just by Mala, anyone could have decided to drop it). And I was right, Agar's post on the claim, Implosion's vote, Mala's hammer happened all in the space of about an hour. I was on the computer during that time frame and my e-mail notifier told me their had been posts in this thread but I wasn't able to view the topic until after the hammer had fallen. I didn't have a chance to vote after my personal vote conditions had been met.<br>\n<br>\nWhen you said this, \"... Also, I have a feeling that he tries keeping himself \"under the radar\"....\" That is the absolute, 100% correct interpretation of my play so far. I replaced into a slot that was pretty much perceived as a null by the rest of the players as far as I could see. I wanted to keep it that way until the end of D1 if I could. Player at L-1, day nearing it's end. I could have always been randomly nightkilled, no way to help that, but I wanted to to be around for D2. Null players don't get NKed except randomly. They do get scumread though but that is correctable.<br>\n<br>\n----<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: phokdapolees</span><br>\n<br>\nAfter the dust-up about Tammy's vote, he doesn't do a whole lot.

(Though, there is a small error in his logic: The Flames wagon was started with a RVS vote too, Agar never changed his vote on Day1.)<br>\n<br>\nBefore the replacement, the wagon was (Agar, Implosion, Aneninen, Tman, Shadowez), <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6144451#p6144451\">300</a>. Tammy joined for a short while, Implosion and Shadowez jumped off afterwards. <br>\n<br>\nMind the fact, that at this point of the game Neil had 3 (and 4, after Phok) votes, while there were two 2-votes-wagons, Rack and Tman. Phokdapolees joined and Implosion rejoined, Chaos put Neil at L&#8211;1 afterwards. Anyone of them, especially Phok could have jumped on any of the counterwagons. Phok had never been on this wagon before, so I think that's a very strong towntell. Implosion's a bit strange, but the post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6146144#p6146144\">333</a> <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">\"The very first thing I find when I look at neil's meta leads me to believe he has a history of fakeclaiming as town.\"</div> seems to be genuine. (Or at least, I did a similar thing later, on Day1). A moderately strong towntell on him. Chaos' vote would have been an unnecessarry bussing if he were scum. Though, it's possible that he jumped on because he felt that Neil would go down. Still, a mild towntell. <br>\nAnd who jumped off the wagon in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6146850#p6146850\">344</a>? Tman! <br>\n<br>\nShadowez returned to the wagon in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6152845#p6152845\">377</a>, L&#8211;1 again. Neil claimed Cop in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6154588#p6154588\">386</a>, Aneninen and Implosion jumped off next. Both of them are returned later (considering the claim a fake one). The other 4 names &#8211; AGar, Phok, Chaos, Shadowez &#8211; could have left the wagon after the claim. Another small townread on all of them.<br>\nTman said in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6155411#p6155411\">424</a> <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">\"I'm going to hop back onto the wagon if nobody has any objections to him being at L-1.\"</div> &#8211; but, at that point his vote would have been the L&#8211;1! (He even added in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6155698#p6155698\">428</a> that he would wait for AGar and Shadowez &#8211; why?)<br>\nMalaKitty's hammer is a null in my eyes: if it hadn't been for her, someone else would have hammered Neil. <br>\n<br>\nAnother notice: considering the living players and excluding the RVS, Rack, and Oso weren't ever on the Neil-wagon. Maybe we should examine them later.</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\nSummary. <br>\nHaving examined the votes I got the following conclusions.<br>\n<br>\nTown: AGar, Phokdapolees<br>\nLean town: Chaos, Implosion + MalaKitty (the latter one is a general read, it has nothing to do with the votes)<br>\n<br>\n...Huh? (can't sort them, the list shows a town -&gt; scum order, though it's mostly intuitional): <br>\nShadowez &#8211; He could have been lean town on this list but Implosion's wall about the topic made me think. Maybe my reads are wrong.<br>\nOso &#8211; More information is needed.<br>\nRack &#8211; Away from the Flames/Neil wagon but, Flames was on his wagon for a long time.

A good example is post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6126429#p6126429\">89</a>, lots of things that just are going with the flow, nothing dangerous, such a safe post.

Shaddowez, you seem to really enjoy going back for Elias and pretty much only Elias for a good while, yet at not one point do you vote him or really push for that lynch.

I&#8217;m actually liking this slot for town so far. Vote for Flames was meeeeh okay. The reasoning was a bit weak to throw someone at L-2, but ehhh.

Here though, he starts off townreading me (which fits the expected scum-BPC strat), but is now voting for me. This doesn't make much sense from him as scum. In his mind, it would likely only encourage me to suspect him (I'm not sure he would have predicted this response from me).<br>\n<br>\nThe only plausible reason for him to vote me as scum, is in an effort to save his buddy Shaddowez.

I never try to argue that his unvoting Flames due to him being replaced is what makes shadow scummy; I merely mentioned it offhandedly as it was necessary for proper chronology. Accusing me of hypocrisy is patently absurd for two main reasons. One, I didn't accuse shadow of being scum for unvoting at the replacement. Two, I did accuse shadow of doing scummy things in the way that shadow voted, unvoted, and interacted with the wagon, and those are things that I did not myself do. Ergo, calling my case hypocrisy is just pure BS.<br>\n<br>\nIt's great that shadow can recount all of the times I voted and unvoted that slot; unfortunately, shadow makes absolutely no attempt to explain why my pattern of voting and unvoting is in any way scummy. <br>\n<br>\nThere's also the accusation that most of my d1 was fluff without any justification of most of my d1 being fluff (read: it really wasn't), and without any explanation of why that would be scummy (read: fluffposting isn't scummy).", "time": "Wed Sep 10, 2014 8:35 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=58816&start=650", "forum": "53", "thread": "58816"}

He never really crumbed, he just elucidated a townread. BPC was not a likely scum kill a priori (I may be wrong about this, but not as far as I can tell in terms of him and his slot having been under suspicion), so there's little good reason to think that he was the scum kill.

Here though, he starts off townreading me (which fits the expected scum-BPC strat), but is now voting for me. This doesn't make much sense from him as scum.

{"number": 765, "id": "6229733", "user": "Aneninen", "user_id": "24164", "content": "@BPC &#8211; my case is pretty much the same as it was Yesterday even if you consider it shyt. I'm not saying that you're buddying AGar; I find it strange that he used to have a case against your slot and that case disappeared into nothingness, without any arguments, right as you arrived. As for Sthar8, he has kept saying that you're obvtown because DeasVail was bodyguarding you but (1) I'm unsure about his reasoning and (2) I've never said that you've been trying buddying him. <br>\n<br>\n@AGar &#8211; it's strange that you tell us now that you refuse to read spoilered cases. There were such cases on Day2 too, eg. Implosion's <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6167900#p6167900\">456</a> or <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6169554#p6169554\">462</a> from me. <br>\n<br>\n@NotScience &#8211; feel free to ask if you don't understand something. Also, we need more posts!<br>\n<br>\n_____<br>\n<br>\nHowever, as for my previous posts. As I mentioned before, I'm not sure whether everything written there is relevant and I've been unable to draw a conclusion from everything collected. Still, there are questions need answering by us. <br>\n<br>\n(1) Can Sthar8 be right about DeasVail's action? If so, does it make BPC clear? If not, is it a bad read by a townie or an intentional \"diversion\" by a scum? (Also, can Sthar8 and BPC be scum together and is BPC distancing himself by voting for him?) <br>\n<br>\n(2) Whom did DeasVail protect? Did he protect anyone at all? In other words: who were his strongest townreads? (It's a thing that he mentioned \"BPC is town\" in his late-posts but there were other townreads on his list: AGar, MalaKitty, Implosion, Phok, Tman, Sthar8.)<br>\n<br>\n(3) Isn't it strange that the ZZZX case survives that long even if he hasn't posted anything useful for a long time? (My experience shows that games usually have \"short term memory\"; I mean, cases against players with content tend to dissolve themselves after a while.)<br>\n<br>\n(4) What if someone performed a chainsaw against Shadowez? His scumpool were DeasVail, ZZZX and NotScience early-Day2 and he added Implosion later. ZZZX was the counterwagon. (There was no strong wagon against DV or Tman/Notscience.) On the Shadowez wagon there were the following players: DeasVail, Implosion, AGar, Aneninen, Sthar8 and BipolarChemist. DV is dead. Sthar8's vote and my one were compromising votes, both of us would have lynched someone else. So, Implosion, AGar and BPC remains. Implosion had launched a case against Shadowez before Shadowez posted his reads. In my opinion AGar is scum only if he's scum with BPC, in this case there was no chainsaw. However, would a ZZZX/BPC wagon be possible? (Either I'm a monomaniac or here's yet another thing which points towards BPC...)", "time": "Thu Sep 18, 2014 7:22 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=58816&start=750", "forum": "53", "thread": "58816"}

This stall was no doubt intentional. There was a lot of unvote revote, especially when neil came into the game. For now, what I see most suspicious was implosion's activity. He seems to be unvoting whenever there is a burst in Flame's voting activity and yet always revote. It would make sense that implosion is not sure whether there will be a lynch on his buddy and thus, whether he should buss his buddy. I will spend more time looking at the specifics of this interaction. For now, implosion looks scummy from this.</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\nFor now I have to leave for appointment. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">I'll come back with Day 2 analysis and Verdict soon.</div>", "time": "Fri Sep 19, 2014 7:54 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=58816&start=775", "forum": "53", "thread": "58816"}

I can understand that as possible but my logic is based very literally on what I would do if I had replaced into your slot. The only way you can think that logic is bad is if you think I'm lying about what I would have done. You can think that if you want to, but I'd really have relatively little reason to lie about something so trivial. It doesn't guarantee that you're scum or anything, all it means is that you not contributing to the apathy doesn't make you town because there are reasons you could have done it as scum. <br>\n<br>\nI honestly think if I were to assess my posts today without knowledge of my alignment that I would find them scummy, but the only reason for that is that I haven't been able to put in the effort to scumhunt because I haven't had the time or energy.

Seeing this, why do you prefer to lynch nopoint (who you don't think is scum) over notscience (who you do think is scum)? Me voting the notscience slot 1) doesn't make the slot town even if I'm scum, and 2) shouldn't even be giving you a townread on the slot unless you're 100% positive that I am scum unless you only scumhunt with one team possibility at a time in which case <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":neutral:\" title=\"Neutral\">", "time": "Sat Sep 27, 2014 10:35 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=58816&start=900", "forum": "53", "thread": "58816"}

Why is waiting for more information to make a decision (especially especially hard information like claim reaction) scummy?<br>\n<br>\nOso's case on Phok was that Phok voted neil a lot but never explained any of it. This suggests he couldn't explain any of it because he didn't have any reasons except for inside information. I don't necessarily agree with this case, but I don't see a horrifically bad logical flaw like you seem to be seeing.

This stall was no doubt intentional. There was a lot of unvote revote, especially when neil came into the game. For now, what I see most suspicious was implosion's activity. He seems to be unvoting whenever there is a burst in Flame's voting activity and yet always revote. It would make sense that implosion is not sure whether there will be a lynch on his buddy and thus, whether he should buss his buddy. I will spend more time looking at the specifics of this interaction. For now, implosion looks scummy from this.</div></div></div><br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Point 2</div>: Implosion's recent posts<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6194300#p6194300\" class=\"postlink\">This vote on shadow</a> was bad and <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6201718#p6201718\" class=\"postlink\">and reason provided was a whim</a>.

(2) is less work and much more relaxing, especially if IRL is busy. (2) is the equivalent of running away from your problems, and I have learned it does not work in real life. <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol2.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"Laughing\"><br>\n<br>\n(1) expends more energy and creates/feeds much more tension, but has a few big cons (guess?) that cannot be ignored.

This time we should lynch a scum for a change.<br>\nHere are my thoughts. <br>\n<br>\n(1) For me, the fact that the game had been stalled before the Day ended suggests that none of the scums were wagoned. If they had been, they would have tried to build a counter-wagon or something like that. NPIAU was the counter-wagon and he voted for Implosion for a long time. But if he were scum wouldn't have his partner done something? Or is the game a 11:2? I'd doubt it. As for NPIAU, his Day3 may have been simply about surviving the game and misreading Implosion?<br>\n<br>\n(2) The Implosion wagon emerged very quickly after my vote. There were Kitty (dead), Nacho and Bert. This points towards the latter two names. (And sadly, towards me too.)<br>\n<br>\n(3) AGar's Day3 was strange. Much less active than before. As far as I remember I was the first one who brought up the possibility of a scum-AGar. His case against me was pigeon poop: he talked about posts which were read even by the Ediacaran fauna. <br>\n<br>\n(4) I still remember calling the Nacho-slot scum before. Is he scum? Is he scum with AGar? Am I misreading him and he noticed something about AGar which I haven't? Nacho, can you post something about your reads?<br>\n<br>\n(5) Notscience is town because... being a Friendly Neighbour? Can anyone alive confirm that? Or have I misread something again?<br>\n<br>\n(6) Sthar is a question mark. If he's scum he's doing it f-cking well. Sometimes I almost forget that he's here at all. Though, caveat: he's (was?) on V/LA.<br>\n<br>\n(7) We should check Day1-AGar. Did he post a viable case about Flames/Neil? If not, that must have been a bus. (What if Flames has replaced out because of the hard-bussing? Or am I making out things out of nothing?)<br>\n<br>\nSo. The names, in a scum &gt;&gt;&gt; town order:<br>\nAGar, Nacho, Bert, Sthar, NPIAU, Notscience.

This stall was no doubt intentional. There was a lot of unvote revote, especially when neil came into the game. For now, what I see most suspicious was implosion's activity. He seems to be unvoting whenever there is a burst in Flame's voting activity and yet always revote. It would make sense that implosion is not sure whether there will be a lynch on his buddy and thus, whether he should buss his buddy. I will spend more time looking at the specifics of this interaction.

And that wasn't the point I was making in the first place, considering I ended up calling it a null town.  Oh also scum aren't more preservationists than town.

This hypothesis would be bullshyt if Bert were scum. There were constant FoS-es and votes for him.<br>\n<br>\n(2) AGar's selfhammer. Bert could have found anything else instead of voting for AGar. Just check out his Day4! He was discontent with my gameplay &#8211; yet he voted for AGar quite early. If he were scum, he could have started a case against me very easily. It's sure that he might have bussed AGar &#8211; but, if there had been a mislych the scums would be at LyLo right now. It might make sense if the busser had much town credit and it definitely doesn't fit Bert. Sthar had been pretty inactive before that. AGar might have been afraid that Sthar's certain activity (eg. by launching a counter-case) would have drawn unnecessary attention to Sthar. Also, Sthar posted only a naked vote for Bert, he did nothing Yesterday.<br>\n<br>\n(3) The Nacho-kill. Do you remember this? <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">\"Vote: AGar. Sthar is the other one, fwiw\"</div>. What if Sthar thought that Nacho had been the Cop?
