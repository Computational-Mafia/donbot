The reason for my vote, and I believe others but I could be mistaken, was he was refusing to accept the fact that the exchange between Flames and Tammy was a joke, and voted Tammy for scumminess based on that exchange.

Based on posts since, and as I said in my last post, I'll be changing my vote.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Rack</span> is avoiding questions, voting with weak or no reasons (including an OMGUS), and most of his posts have been fluff at best.  I'm not really comfortable with how quick this wagon grew, but he definitely doesn't feel town to me.  Rack, please explain all of your votes so far, especially your most recent one.  Until then, consider this your L-2 vote.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Rack</span>"}

His vote against Phokdapolees in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6125126#p6125126\">66</a> is based upon a really weak thing: Phok's interpretation on their joke (with Tammy). Not getting a joke is a null in itself, in my opinion. In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6125131#p6125131\">67</a> he pushes Rack (that's viable), in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6125308#p6125308\">75</a> he told that Rack had wanted to be playful. (How exactly, I think.) In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6126822#p6126822\">92</a> he \"attacks\" Phok's vote for Rack. For sure, Phok's argument wasn't a strong one but it has been far not the weakest in this thread so far. In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6128235#p6128235\">119</a> he protects Rack yet again, <span style=\"font-style: italic\">\"If he says he's played with Tammy before, he probably has and he's a confirmed alt as well\"</span> (though in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6125131#p6125131\">67</a> he wanted a reference from Rack). In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6130580#p6130580\">149</a> he left alone Phokdapolees \u2013 I think he had realized that that wagon hadn't been moving. That post has very little content. Here he brought up yet again that Rock hadn't given references about Tammy. (Yet another contradiction.) I don't know why Rack's MalaKitty vote was town in his opinion. At the end of the post Flame brought up (in my opinion) real scumtells against Rack but for that he needn't have made a long quote with \"playful/seem town/etc\" before that.<br>In general, he is producing inconsistent and \"it looks as if it contained more information than it contains\" posts (unless I've seriously skimmed over something) and I usually consider this a scumread. <br><br>2. Implosion hasn't got a free pass, he's on the lean town tier with many other players. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6125145#p6125145\">68</a> would get a similar read from me as Rack's post since he talked about Tammy without giving a reference but he gave one in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6125167#p6125167\">71</a> (town/null tell, unsure). I agree with <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6125157#p6125157\">70</a> on the other hand (so, a minor town vibe for that).

That question went for me, didn't it?<br><br>3. Phokdapolees. Missing a joke is a null. The \"lean town\" read is more-or-less a gut read: the way the tried to explain himself (eg. about the joke) felt townish. I think he tries to get reads but he fails to get good bits.

And it's frustrating because I didn't know I was at L-2 when I started my read through, and then to find out I'm about to be lynched after actually wanting to put time and effort into this game, like seriously?

You replaced into a scumread slot which makes all of us biased. (Even if many of us think that so far you've failed to change this picture.) I, personally find your wallposts tiring because it's hard to follow them (because you don't use links or concrete references like this: <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6123131#p6123131\">346</a>) and your +/\u2013 system doesn't help me to read them.

I've been trying to figure out what the hell he was talking about.  Actually his reads don't make any sense with his third quote in this very post.  He's using things that aren't even a glimmer in a scum tells eye to claim people are scummy.  For instance, he said that flames was scummy for being the fourth vote on someone before they posted.  ERM yeah okay bud.<br><br>Anyway, I just don't see a cop making this post to me.  He made a scummy post and I voted him.  He had already given me scum points for playing mafia, so I don't get the response at all.  What is also amusing is he's saying that he's leaning towards voting me when he's only read three pages of the game, which is increasing my suspicion that he designated me as a scum read when he started reading the game.  But why would you make this post if you were a cop?  If you're a cop, and you have this strong suspicion I'm scum, even if you're worried your suspicion is going to get taken less seriously because it could be perceived as omgus, you're a cop.

If I don't make sense here and there, don't mind me I'm still on very little sleep.  Anyway, I'm going to be quick and brief because I still have a lecture to finish writing and other stuff to do.<br><br>I still like my town reads for the most part.  If Neil comes back scum, I think I'll feel even better about Agar as it doesn't feel like a bus.  I think.  Well that's how I feel right now.<br><br>I'm not entirely sure what Malakittens sees in tman though.  He is null territory and sometimes what she says pings seems a bit nitpicky.<br><br>Not a fan of Neil though.  I really don't know how he can have the reads he has, like at all.  He feels like scum who thought I'd be an easy push so went for it; his tone is just so eh.  Some things are just funny though, and I refuse to believe that someone with any amount of experience in this game is reading it the way he is and is town, especially after looking through his meta a bit.  He actually has thoughtful reads, which demonstrate an attempt to solve the game, and I'm not seeing that here.  Like the things he makes a big deal out of concerning me are things I don't accept he actually thinks.  He said I had no good reason to call myself town in my first post.  Well I do have good reason, it's called a town role pm.  He has played with people who declare they're town in their first post before and not made a deal of it.  <br><br>He's also not new, so should understand that early bandwagons happen, they can tell you a lot about the person being wagoned and who's voting, and he's characterizing my very obvious joke votes as something serious.  Like literally I claimed that my cat told me to vote flames in rvs and then thanked malakittens for confessing.  I don't understand how anyone could think those were serious votes and I was just going for \"anything that would stick\".  <br><br>Oh you know what was funny?  He considered that Implosion made the only sound post on page one and liked him for it.  On page one, Neil was scum reading me; Implosion made a joke about me and claimed I was town.  Now how in the hell does someone town reading his big suspect garner him the most thoughtful post of the page?  <br><br>His read on phok and tman are complete crap as well.  Actually I find that people who are unwilling to change their mind when their argument has been proven incorrect to be more likely scum.  Scum tend to stick to early reads even when they're pointed out for crap reasons, not town.  So when someone scum reads you, and they're told they completely misinterpreted everything and decides the person is still scum, it's more likely scum not town sticking to their guns.  <br><br>Tman's pointing out that I had called myself town several times does not in any way shape or form demonstrate someone who is reading the game and is pointing out motivations.  It's a null tell.  It's also something that scum can very easily do to look like they're scum hunting.  Oh she called herself town too many times, that's scummy.  And for Neil to be all \"oh I didn't know if anyone would notice it\" I mean what?  Town and scum have come after me for calling myself town before.  It's never stopped me from calling myself town!  (What I think makes him look town from the affair is that it looks to me like Rack said this was my scum meta, not long after that Tman pulled up posts where I'm referring to myself being town and says it looks like a joke but do I do it often.  Considering that was the most of what I did do, it makes sense that if someone says hey she's scum by meta, he'd go looking.  It looks like he took Tman's accusation seriously and went looking for what could make me scum.  That's something that I'd expect more from town trying to figure out the game than from scum who would know that Rack was lying.)<br><br>Oh the Rack thing is crap as well.  I mean obviously I know I'm town and this is my town meta, cuz you know kind of an expert on me, so when he said that I was definitely scum by meta, I knew that there was something else there.  Neil trying to claim that I was invalidate his opinion by calling out what he was doing is pure bullshit.  Of course I was trying to figure out what he was doing with that.  He says it's interesting I called out Rack's lie before he admitted it.  UM you usually know when someone is lying about you.  (You slept with my boyfriend.  No, I didn't that's a lie.  How do you know it's a lie?!?!?!?  Y'all must have planned it GOTCHA)  Also, if anyone thinks that's a planned reaction test, they must be on serious crack.  I just don't believe he believes his conclusion.  What I am concerned about here is that Rack is his partner, and he's trying to tie me to his partner.<br><br>Oh also whoever is scum reading Rack for claiming that he lied about my meta in order to find a reason to get off of my wagon, that's a bad reason to be voting Rack.  Things don't work that way and it's a complete null tell.  Rack would have never been able to get by with voting me and causing a wagon based on my meta anyway.  As a brief site search would have netted anyone who looked the exact opposite view of me.  Not only that but Implosion had already mentioned playing with me, and I think it was obvious that Agar and Malakittens have experience with me too.  Rack was either doing exactly what he said he was doing...reaction testing.  Or he was scum pretending to reaction test.  But jumping off my wagon because this isn't my scum meta doesn't make him scum.  Rack could have potentially been reaction testing me as well, but it does not work so well when it's in the beginning of the game and I don't know who you are.<br><br>I was going to point out that Neil hadn't mentioned chaos lord at all, but his last catch up post reached page five and chaos didn't post until page 6.<br><br>The only thing that worries me with my Neil read is that I feel like I'm getting overly involved in his read on me and just how shit it is.  I'd probably feel better about his read on me if he was a newb or a VI, but reading through his games today he's just not so I don't believe the tells he's using.  I more feel like he thought I'd be an easy target.<br><br>My other biggest suspect besides Neil is chaos lord.  He just feels like he's trying to look involved in the game but really isn't trying to figure out the game.<br><br>I have the same feeling with Elias though.  He also still didn't answer my question why it was wifom for my tell with Rack.  It's my tell, and unless Rack had been in a game with me where I used that tell to call someone town, then it can't be wifom.  And really it would be silly in the first place.  it's like he's trying to argue that Rack went oh Tammy thinks unhelpful people tend to be town so I'm going to claim to have meta and then refuse to answer because then Tammy will call me town for refusing to answer.  And that wasn't the point I was making in the first place, considering I ended up calling it a null town.  Oh also scum aren't more preservationists than town.  Some people hate getting mislynched worse than correctly lynched.  I feel like Elias is focusing on the wrong thing there, and asked me a question about it just to do it.  It felt like busy work.  <br><br>Okay I really need to write this lecture for tomorrow, and I promised this would be brief and LIED!"}

The vote looks like scum begrudgingly deciding to bus when they realize Flames is probably going down rather than town looking for scum. \"Seeing as I don't have any other strong suspicions right now\" also doesn't mesh very well with voting him to L-1, but those make plenty of sense together if it's a bus.<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6140044#p6140044\" class=\"postlink\">post 280</a>, shaddowez wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6139941#p6139941\" class=\"postlink\">post 278</a>, Elias_the_thief wrote:</cite><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: </span><br>Shadow, how is this situation at all different than the wagon on Rack?</div></blockquote><br><br>Mainly, post count.

There's also the classic thing here of throwing a general accusation at a bandwagon rather than any individual people on it - if it's concerning that all of these votes are from wagonhoppers, then town-shaddowez should elaborate on what people are scummy because of it, and why those people are less deserving of a vote than Flames. He's also continuing to give himself an out with respect to the wagon.<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6151882#p6151882\" class=\"postlink\">post 373</a>, shaddowez wrote:</cite>I'm still waiting to hear more from Neil before putting my vote back on him.

Look at this: <span style=\"font-style: italic\">\"Shadow, how is this situation at all different than the wagon on Rack?\"</span> (Elias, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6139941#p6139941\">278</a>). I strongly think that the Flames-wagon was <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">greatly</span> different than the Rack-wagon. Shadowez pointed out the same thing in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6140044#p6140044\">280</a>: <span style=\"font-style: italic\">\"Mainly, post count. The wagon on Rack started day 1 with an RVS vote, and grew in just a few days. In that timeframe, and the time since the Flame wagon started, everyone has been posting, and there's been more content to scrutinize.\"</span>. (Though, there is a small error in his logic: The Flames wagon was started with a RVS vote too, Agar never changed his vote on Day1.)<br><br>Before the replacement, the wagon was (Agar, Implosion, Aneninen, Tman, Shadowez), <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6144451#p6144451\">300</a>. Tammy joined for a short while, Implosion and Shadowez jumped off afterwards. <br><br>Mind the fact, that at this point of the game Neil had 3 (and 4, after Phok) votes, while there were two 2-votes-wagons, Rack and Tman. Phokdapolees joined and Implosion rejoined, Chaos put Neil at L\u20131 afterwards. Anyone of them, especially Phok could have jumped on any of the counterwagons. Phok had never been on this wagon before, so I think that's a very strong towntell. Implosion's a bit strange, but the post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6146144#p6146144\">333</a> <span style=\"font-style: italic\">\"The very first thing I find when I look at neil's meta leads me to believe he has a history of fakeclaiming as town.\"</span> seems to be genuine. (Or at least, I did a similar thing later, on Day1). A moderately strong towntell on him. Chaos' vote would have been an unnecessarry bussing if he were scum. Though, it's possible that he jumped on because he felt that Neil would go down. Still, a mild towntell. <br>And who jumped off the wagon in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6146850#p6146850\">344</a>? Tman! <br><br>Shadowez returned to the wagon in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6152845#p6152845\">377</a>, L\u20131 again. Neil claimed Cop in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6154588#p6154588\">386</a>, Aneninen and Implosion jumped off next. Both of them are returned later (considering the claim a fake one). The other 4 names \u2013 AGar, Phok, Chaos, Shadowez \u2013 could have left the wagon after the claim.

Your posting it did nothing but pad your post count and feign town interest in a position when it became clear that Neil's gambit was going to bear no fruits. Neil claimed in 386. Anen made his post in 390. You posted in 389 and did NOT feel it necessary then to say \"Don't counterclaim.\" 394 tman says \"Don't CC.\" 395 Mala says \"He's fishing for the real cop.\" 396 Tammy says \"Don't cc.\" Post 401 you finally say \"Don't CC.\" 3 other people said it before you. Another person expressed disbelief in Neil's claim. But you wait until they come in and then ride the popular opinion of \"Don't CC!\" Again, like before - it wasn't your first instinct to say \"Don't claim!\" You waited until you got reactions. Trust me, even without a CC, there are people who drop tells. You don't need the CC to confirm the cop to you.<br><br>Also, lol @ trying to educate me on mafia theory.

My reads are not too strong, but it seems that he's not scumhunting. Also, I have a feeling that he tries keeping himself \"under the radar\".

First, I'm just going to go through my townreads and what I feel most makes them town. If they're a wide a townread, I'll probably be quite minimal.<br><br>AGar: Pushed Flames wagon from start to end. No other problems with him. Generally quite town. Cool.<br><br>Malakittens: First to say she didn't believe neil's claim. If she was willing to be so bus-heavy as scum I think she would have actually gotten on the wagon. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6154724#p6154724\">392</a> would have to be very clever to come from scum. Possible, but unlikely. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6154998#p6154998\">413</a> feels unlikely to come from scum due to fear of being accused of lining up lynches.<br><br>Implosion: His vote made the difference between Flames being AGar's scumread and being an actual wagon. Concerns relating to neil's alignment come across as genuine, because if scum he's already decided to bus. There is no point in scum-implosion unvoting and pondering about the lynch when it doesn't do anything to change the lynch target and may cause others to suspect him after the flip.<br><br>Phok: Voting for Tammy after AGar &amp; implosion express high confidence in her being town is brave for scum, but probably doesn't achieve much at all. His reaction to criticisms of his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6127078#p6127078\">98</a> make me townread him since he kind of clearly doesn't care. Also Flames' push of him is a +.<br><br>Tman2nd: I thought he was quite viable scum for a long time, but this all changes with <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6146850#p6146850\">344</a>. If tman2nd is scum with neil, there is no point in unvoting. The townies are dead-set on his lynch at this stage, there is no real reason to believe that he won't be lynched. It only draws attention that scum would not want. For town though, who don't know neil's alignment, it's totally reasonable and makes sense.<br><br>Rack: Never thought he was scum really. Reaction test thing is totally crazy and therefore more likely from town imo.<br><br>~~<br><br>Aneninen: Slightly weaker townread than the others but still a townread. I find his personality makes it difficult to assess his alignment as he sometimes does things that I usually would find scummy, but I suspect that these may be more of a personality thing than anything else. Most concerning for me is the part I quoted earlier from <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6134608#p6134608\">212</a>, because why say that people should keep an eye on you if you're town? Seems more likely scum would say it just to appear reasonable. However, Aneninen often does things such as call his own posts weak, so I question the validity of my point. His vote on Flames comes a little early, but not too early for scum. However, the call-out for cop counterclaims after neil's own claim, this being after negative responses to the claim, just feels way out there for scum, and is the main reason why I townread this slot despite my concerns.<br><br>~~<br><br>Shaddowez: Mostly a PoE read. His play in regards to flames/neil is nothing beyond scum as far as I can see. The main thing holding me back though, as silly as it may sound, is <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6123557#p6123557\">21</a>. Notice the similarity in style of RVS to flames, while everyone else is different. I feel scum may make more effort to do something different from a buddy, but I consider this point quite weak after some thought. I didn't notice anything scummy in particular during my read-through, but I haven't reviewed the most recent case on him properly and will read his own posts more deeply tomorrow.<br><br>Oso: Nothing that's really town about him, but nothing all that scummy either? It's really hard to say for me, as his posts are quite odd at times. Another I will need to look further into.<br><br>Chaoslord: His read progression on the neill/flames scumslot seems pretty unnatural as well as being likely to be what scum would do there imo. He starts off thinking flames is town, ignores the flames wagon until specifically asked, where he then makes an awkward wishy-washy post not really saying anything but trying not to get Flames lynched <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6138588#p6138588\">256</a>. However, in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6146651#p6146651\">339</a> he then goes into 'bus my buddy' mode and despite quite strongly townreading flames, he lets nothing get in the way of his new 'scumread', which I feel is unrealistic for town, but matches scum that has decided neill is going down.<br><br>Reads are still a bit shonky in parts (Oso in particular), but hopefully this will be fixed soon. I'm not going to vote yet because I need to look further into Oso and Shaddowez, but chaoslord is my preferred lynch right now."}

It was your initial entrance. That speaks a lot louder than afterwords when you either had time to say \"Oh shit, that was dumb!\" or a scumbuddy possibly told you. The point is a town player's first mindset isn't \"Oh let me not contribute!\" If it is, they're bad.</fieldset><br>Nice dichotomy you have going there. A couple of them actually. Putting aside what you think proper entrance play for a replacement is, how exactly would a scumbuddy have told me I was screwing up?<br><br>---<br><br>@Aneninen. Couple of points there I'll go ahead and answer.<br><br>Mala tied Chaos being scum with Niel being scum. That question was me wondering if she had anything independent of Niel's alignment to base Chaos' alignment on. Her saying she'd re-evaluate if Niel was the cop, told me she was using an association rather than what she considered solid evidence. I'd still like to know why she thinks they are connected though.<br><br>I had made it clear that I would hammer Niel. But I also wanted both Shadowez and Agar post their thoughts before it happened. They were the only two who had been on the wagon pre-claim that hadn't posted their thoughts on the claim after Neil made it. I couldn't guarantee that would happen but I could help make it happen by not voting. I point to Mala's requesting the Hammer a couple of times and the whole mood was leaning lynch Neil. If he had gotten to L-1 again, I was afraid there would be a hammer (not just by Mala, anyone could have decided to drop it). And I was right, Agar's post on the claim, Implosion's vote, Mala's hammer happened all in the space of about an hour. I was on the computer during that time frame and my e-mail notifier told me their had been posts in this thread but I wasn't able to view the topic until after the hammer had fallen. I didn't have a chance to vote after my personal vote conditions had been met.<br><br>When you said this, \"... Also, I have a feeling that he tries keeping himself \"under the radar\"....\" That is the absolute, 100% correct interpretation of my play so far. I replaced into a slot that was pretty much perceived as a null by the rest of the players as far as I could see. I wanted to keep it that way until the end of D1 if I could. Player at L-1, day nearing it's end. I could have always been randomly nightkilled, no way to help that, but I wanted to to be around for D2. Null players don't get NKed except randomly.

Look at this: <span style=\"font-style: italic\">\"Shadow, how is this situation at all different than the wagon on Rack?\"</span> (Elias, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6139941#p6139941\">278</a>). I strongly think that the Flames-wagon was <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">greatly</span> different than the Rack-wagon. Shadowez pointed out the same thing in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6140044#p6140044\">280</a>: <span style=\"font-style: italic\">\"Mainly, post count. The wagon on Rack started day 1 with an RVS vote, and grew in just a few days. In that timeframe, and the time since the Flame wagon started, everyone has been posting, and there's been more content to scrutinize.\"</span>. (Though, there is a small error in his logic: The Flames wagon was started with a RVS vote too, Agar never changed his vote on Day1.)<br><br>Before the replacement, the wagon was (Agar, Implosion, Aneninen, Tman, Shadowez), <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6144451#p6144451\">300</a>. Tammy joined for a short while, Implosion and Shadowez jumped off afterwards. <br><br>Mind the fact, that at this point of the game Neil had 3 (and 4, after Phok) votes, while there were two 2-votes-wagons, Rack and Tman. Phokdapolees joined and Implosion rejoined, Chaos put Neil at L\u20131 afterwards. Anyone of them, especially Phok could have jumped on any of the counterwagons. Phok had never been on this wagon before, so I think that's a very strong towntell. Implosion's a bit strange, but the post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6146144#p6146144\">333</a> <span style=\"font-style: italic\">\"The very first thing I find when I look at neil's meta leads me to believe he has a history of fakeclaiming as town.\"</span> seems to be genuine. (Or at least, I did a similar thing later, on Day1). A moderately strong towntell on him. Chaos' vote would have been an unnecessarry bussing if he were scum. Though, it's possible that he jumped on because he felt that Neil would go down. Still, a mild towntell. <br>And who jumped off the wagon in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6146850#p6146850\">344</a>? Tman! <br><br>Shadowez returned to the wagon in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6152845#p6152845\">377</a>, L\u20131 again. Neil claimed Cop in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6154588#p6154588\">386</a>, Aneninen and Implosion jumped off next. Both of them are returned later (considering the claim a fake one). The other 4 names \u2013 AGar, Phok, Chaos, Shadowez \u2013 could have left the wagon after the claim. Another small townread on all of them.<br>Tman said in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6155411#p6155411\">424</a> <span style=\"font-style: italic\">\"I'm going to hop back onto the wagon if nobody has any objections to him being at L-1.\"</span> \u2013 but, at that point his vote would have been the L\u20131! (He even added in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6155698#p6155698\">428</a> that he would wait for AGar and Shadowez \u2013 why?)<br>MalaKitty's hammer is a null in my eyes: if it hadn't been for her, someone else would have hammered Neil. <br><br>Another notice: considering the living players and excluding the RVS, Rack, and Oso weren't ever on the Neil-wagon.

A good example is post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6126429#p6126429\">89</a>, lots of things that just are going with the flow, nothing dangerous, such a safe post.

I\u2019m actually liking this slot for town so far. Vote for Flames was meeeeh okay. The reasoning was a bit weak to throw someone at L-2, but ehhh.

Considering that was the most of what I did do, it makes sense that if someone says hey she's scum by meta, he'd go looking.

That's something that I'd expect more from town trying to figure out the game than from scum who would know that Rack was lying.)</div></blockquote><br><br>None of this is solid evidence, but it's what's pointing me in the direction of believe tman could have been responsible for Tammy's death."}

D2 has been much stronger, with actual reasons and content in his posts.  <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">BPC</span> - Currently leaning town on BPC, but will go through the slot.  Riabi didn't really have enough content to go off of before his replace out, so was a null tell at the time.  Oso's entrance was a bit odd, but I can't say I think it was scummy.  IMO it would have been much scummier to come in and hammer off the bat, regardless of the flip.  He then does get involved, and gives some pretty detailed answers and reasons to his posts.  BPC came in with a substantial reads list pretty much off the bat, then some fluff interlaced with some more content.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">DV</span> - Scum McScumfin.

Not really getting a scum read at all, but not really a town read either.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">ns</span> - Null, leaning scum on the slot, though I want to hear more from ns.  I know I'm in the minority for this one, but there was just something about tman's posts I didn't like.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">phok</span> - Null.

Accusing me of hypocrisy is patently absurd for two main reasons. One, I didn't accuse shadow of being scum for unvoting at the replacement. Two, I did accuse shadow of doing scummy things in the way that shadow voted, unvoted, and interacted with the wagon, and those are things that I did not myself do. Ergo, calling my case hypocrisy is just pure BS.<br><br>It's great that shadow can recount all of the times I voted and unvoted that slot; unfortunately, shadow makes absolutely no attempt to explain why my pattern of voting and unvoting is in any way scummy. <br><br>There's also the accusation that most of my d1 was fluff without any justification of most of my d1 being fluff (read: it really wasn't), and without any explanation of why that would be scummy (read: fluffposting isn't scummy)."}

I have never stopped thinking that you're scum. There is just nothing in particular I can point to in your posts that I think indicates scum. This is not incredibly surprising to me since scum are often quite actively trying not to look scummy. Sometimes they might succeed!

Or maybe because it's a big hedgey pile of crap.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6167900#p6167900\" class=\"postlink\">post 456</a>, implosion wrote:</cite>This <span class=\"noboldsig\">can be looked at as possibly</span> defending-without-really-defending, or trying to deter anything that looks like an accusation of Flames without really looking like deterring it.<br>[...]<br>This <span class=\"noboldsig\">looks like possible</span> coaching. It reads like scum telling scum \"hey, you're being scummy, stop that.\"<br>[...]<br>Lots of qualification on the vote: he's only voting him because he doesn't have any strong suspicions, so it's easy to get out, but he still wants to be on the wagon. The vote <span class=\"noboldsig\">looks like</span> scum begrudgingly deciding to bus when they realize Flames is probably going down rather than town looking for scum. \"Seeing as I don't have any other strong suspicions right now\" also doesn't mesh very well with voting him to L-1, but those make plenty of sense together if it's a bus.<br>[...]<br>So he's concerned about the wagon, and about the people on it, yet is still happy with putting it at L-1. There's also the classic thing here of throwing a general accusation at a bandwagon rather than any individual people on it - if it's concerning that all of these votes are from wagonhoppers, then town-shaddowez should elaborate on what people are scummy because of it, and why those people are less deserving of a vote than Flames. He's also continuing to give himself an out with respect to the wagon.<br>[...]<br>Note that he unvoted because of the replacement. Here he gives more tentative support for lynching the slot without really committing.<br>[...]<br>This also <span class=\"noboldsig\">looks like</span> it could be scum trying to get on the wagon before it reaches the lynch because they see it as inevitable. <br>[...]<br>I would say the saying he ISO'd flames is a favor in point of shaddowez town, <span class=\"noboldsig\">but meh</span>. Similar comments apply to this as to everything else.<br>[...]<br>tl;dr: shaddowez's interactions towards the Flames slot, on the whole, <span class=\"noboldsig\">feel like</span> scum who doesn't want to push the slot, but wants to get towncred for being on the wagon.</div></blockquote>Edited to remove quotes.  Also, bolded for interesting phrasing.<br><br>The amount of noncommittal verbage is particularly staggering when you consider that one of implosions points against shadow is... noncommittal verbage.  The \"unvote because of replacement\"  thing is hilariously dumb, especially considering implosion's second vote for shadow.  On the whole, the case looks to be implosion scumreading shadow for not being certain that flames was scum.  Which is super questionable, and given implosion's scummy-as-hell voting record for day1, I'm not buying any turnips from this stall."}

If not, is it a bad read by a townie or an intentional \"diversion\" by a scum? (Also, can Sthar8 and BPC be scum together and is BPC distancing himself by voting for him?) <br><br>(2) Whom did DeasVail protect? Did he protect anyone at all? In other words: who were his strongest townreads? (It's a thing that he mentioned \"BPC is town\" in his late-posts but there were other townreads on his list: AGar, MalaKitty, Implosion, Phok, Tman, Sthar8.)<br><br>(3) Isn't it strange that the ZZZX case survives that long even if he hasn't posted anything useful for a long time? (My experience shows that games usually have \"short term memory\"; I mean, cases against players with content tend to dissolve themselves after a while.)<br><br>(4) What if someone performed a chainsaw against Shadowez? His scumpool were DeasVail, ZZZX and NotScience early-Day2 and he added Implosion later. ZZZX was the counterwagon. (There was no strong wagon against DV or Tman/Notscience.) On the Shadowez wagon there were the following players: DeasVail, Implosion, AGar, Aneninen, Sthar8 and BipolarChemist. DV is dead. Sthar8's vote and my one were compromising votes, both of us would have lynched someone else. So, Implosion, AGar and BPC remains. Implosion had launched a case against Shadowez before Shadowez posted his reads. In my opinion AGar is scum only if he's scum with BPC, in this case there was no chainsaw. However, would a ZZZX/BPC wagon be possible? (Either I'm a monomaniac or here's yet another thing which points towards BPC...)"}

This stall was no doubt intentional. There was a lot of unvote revote, especially when neil came into the game. For now, what I see most suspicious was implosion's activity. He seems to be unvoting whenever there is a burst in Flame's voting activity and yet always revote. It would make sense that implosion is not sure whether there will be a lynch on his buddy and thus, whether he should buss his buddy. I will spend more time looking at the specifics of this interaction. For now, implosion looks scummy from this.</div></div></div><br><br>For now I have to leave for appointment. <span class=\"noboldsig\">I'll come back with Day 2 analysis and Verdict soon.</span>"}

His stance on the rack wagon was very awkward and non-committal, even lauding tman for unvoting at one point while he remained on it. It was as if he was looking for a better, more viable alternative. I was finding awkward, almost coy, interactions on Day 1 when I was taking up lines of questioning with him. 337 in particular looked like a way of saying \"Hey do something so I have an excuse to unvote you.\" 390 he calls for the counterclaim. The claim by neil was fairly certain to be trying to draw out a claim. Anen unvotes in that same post. Later posts have been similar in \"Someone tell me why I shouldn't vote this person!\" Like he's trying to figure out how to get out of things in any way possible."}

This stall was no doubt intentional. There was a lot of unvote revote, especially when neil came into the game. For now, what I see most suspicious was implosion's activity. He seems to be unvoting whenever there is a burst in Flame's voting activity and yet always revote. It would make sense that implosion is not sure whether there will be a lynch on his buddy and thus, whether he should buss his buddy. I will spend more time looking at the specifics of this interaction.

If I have been lurking most of the day and then start posting of course you'll be able to call what I'm doing pot-shots... it isn't exactly descriptive of whether i'm town or scum."}

Two mislynches and I was on both wagons. This time we should lynch a scum for a change.<br>Here are my thoughts. <br><br>(1) For me, the fact that the game had been stalled before the Day ended suggests that none of the scums were wagoned. If they had been, they would have tried to build a counter-wagon or something like that. NPIAU was the counter-wagon and he voted for Implosion for a long time. But if he were scum wouldn't have his partner done something? Or is the game a 11:2? I'd doubt it. As for NPIAU, his Day3 may have been simply about surviving the game and misreading Implosion?<br><br>(2) The Implosion wagon emerged very quickly after my vote. There were Kitty (dead), Nacho and Bert. This points towards the latter two names. (And sadly, towards me too.)<br><br>(3) AGar's Day3 was strange. Much less active than before. As far as I remember I was the first one who brought up the possibility of a scum-AGar. His case against me was pigeon poop: he talked about posts which were read even by the Ediacaran fauna. <br><br>(4) I still remember calling the Nacho-slot scum before. Is he scum? Is he scum with AGar? Am I misreading him and he noticed something about AGar which I haven't? Nacho, can you post something about your reads?<br><br>(5) Notscience is town because... being a Friendly Neighbour? Can anyone alive confirm that? Or have I misread something again?<br><br>(6) Sthar is a question mark. If he's scum he's doing it f-cking well. Sometimes I almost forget that he's here at all. Though, caveat: he's (was?) on V/LA.<br><br>(7) We should check Day1-AGar. Did he post a viable case about Flames/Neil? If not, that must have been a bus. (What if Flames has replaced out because of the hard-bussing? Or am I making out things out of nothing?)<br><br>So. The names, in a scum &gt;&gt;&gt; town order:<br>AGar, Nacho, Bert, Sthar, NPIAU, Notscience. (Unsure about the Nacho/Bert pair.)<br><br>I daren't vote; that would be an L\u20131 and I'm afraid of a quickhammer."}

He seems to be unvoting whenever there is a burst in Flame's voting activity and yet always revote. It would make sense that implosion is not sure whether there will be a lynch on his buddy and thus, whether he should buss his buddy.

He also still didn't answer my question why it was wifom for my tell with Rack.  It's my tell, and unless Rack had been in a game with me where I used that tell to call someone town, then it can't be wifom.  And really it would be silly in the first place.  it's like he's trying to argue that Rack went oh Tammy thinks unhelpful people tend to be town so I'm going to claim to have meta and then refuse to answer because then Tammy will call me town for refusing to answer.  And that wasn't the point I was making in the first place, considering I ended up calling it a null town.  Oh also scum aren't more preservationists than town.  Some people hate getting mislynched worse than correctly lynched.  I feel like Elias is focusing on the wrong thing there, and asked me a question about it just to do it.

So, Notscience, start collecting everything about Bert, Sthar8 and me. <br><br>_____<br><br>Right now, I think Sthar8 is scum. There are a couple of things which might confirm this.<br><br>(1) This game got stalled plenty of times, sometimes at strange moments, eg. before deadline. I posted it before that I had find it significant. A game can be stalled when none of the scums are suspected and they don't need to do anything to move the game on. This hypothesis would be bullshyt if Bert were scum. There were constant FoS-es and votes for him.<br><br>(2) AGar's selfhammer. Bert could have found anything else instead of voting for AGar. Just check out his Day4! He was discontent with my gameplay \u2013 yet he voted for AGar quite early. If he were scum, he could have started a case against me very easily. It's sure that he might have bussed AGar \u2013 but, if there had been a mislych the scums would be at LyLo right now. It might make sense if the busser had much town credit and it definitely doesn't fit Bert. Sthar had been pretty inactive before that. AGar might have been afraid that Sthar's certain activity (eg. by launching a counter-case) would have drawn unnecessary attention to Sthar. Also, Sthar posted only a naked vote for Bert, he did nothing Yesterday.<br><br>(3) The Nacho-kill. Do you remember this? <span style=\"font-style: italic\">\"Vote: AGar. Sthar is the other one, fwiw\"</span>. What if Sthar thought that Nacho had been the Cop? In this case... the Nightkill makes perfect sense."}

The pictures were funny, there were frequent Vote Counts, quick reactions to the possible issues. I really liked the PMs about \"you're getting close to a prod\". Sometimes I find it tiring to check my \"time elapsed\" data and that helped a lot. Also, I think the \"PM me at Night even if you have no Night Action\" is a good idea.<br><br>The players were nice and great too.<br>Bert and NPIAU did it very well during the last Days.<br><br>Neil replaced into a very difficult situation. However, there was a mistake from him I wasn't allowed to tell. By the time he posted that \"sorry I need to V/LA, no internet, blah\" he had posts in other threads and he <span style=\"font-style: italic\">did not</span> mention the situation anywhere <span style=\"font-style: italic\">but</span> in this thread. Because of this I was sure that he was scum.<br><br>AGar, you had an excellent play too! After Day1 you looked sooo obv-town. There was something and I don't know whether a mistake or an unfortunate coincidence. I was the one who talk about the possibility of scum!AGar (with BPC \u2013 so, the reasoning was shyt) and at that time noone else had similar thoughts. Later you started to go after me and that confirmed my scumread on you. (It might have been a coincidence too, because this topic didn't show up in the Mafia QT.)<br><br>Sthar, you shouldn't feel bad, my scumread on you was not a PoE. I hadn't got time so I posted a less than half-baked case on you \u2013 but that was enough for Bert to focus on you. (Or he realized the same things independently?) Had I had more time, I would have found many other evidences. Eventually, you played it well \u2013 I realized that the <span style=\"font-style: italic\">most</span> possible explanation for the Day1 wagon could be the following: Rack is Goon-PR, Flames is Goon and AGar bussed Flames because of this and to get zillions of town-credit. Two birds with one stone, eh? A pity that I was swimming, watching Twin Peaks with my sweetheart and sleeping, so I didn't post anything about it.<br><br>As for Bert and NPIAU. After that terrible Implosion-lynch (erm, sorry everyone) I was <span style=\"font-style: italic\">sure</span> that the game had been stalled in a very strange game-phase because none of the scums had been wagoned. Therefore, I thought that it was very unlikely that Bert and NPIAU were scums. <br><br>My personal moral of the game: I should not end a Day with a \"Not voting\". Lucky for us, Bert finished the game before I started to launch a well-built case about Sthar. If it hadn't been for him, Sthar would have started bombing us with WIFOMs for sure and <span style=\"font-style: italic\">that</span> wouldn't have helped us. ^_^"}

I was amused to see rack said he did thinking was scum when he forgot being scum, my beginning play was about as town as I get in the first couple pages.
