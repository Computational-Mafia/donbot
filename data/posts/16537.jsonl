But you really didn't like walking around with your eyebrows shaved off.<br>\n<br>\nYou knew it would take time to devise a devilishly clever plan for revenge. And you meretriciously planned it over the following years.<br>\n<br>\nIt took you time to save up, but finally you did it and you had enough money to buy a holiday to Africa. It would be dangerous and unforgiving but you knew the success of your master plan relied on it. With care and diligence, you stuffed some baby monkeys into your underwear and smuggled them back home.<br>\n<br>\nOver the years you raised them as your own, pumping them with steroids and brainwashing them with your propaganda.<br>\n<br>\nFinally. Their time was due. And not a moment too late. You were ready. Your Ninja Monkey's were ready. You would deliver a swift and stunning blow, one which would cripple your enemies forever, and teach the world never to mess with you again. And they would never see it coming.<br>\n<br>\nYou instructed your monkeys to proceed to destroy their target. It was a target of utmost significance. Losing it would shatter their pride and hope.<br>\n<br>\nTheir pet goldfishes had to die.</div></fieldset><br>\n<br>\n<div align=\"center\"><hr style=\"height:14px;width:90%\"></div><div style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: normal; display: inline\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Game Information</div></div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Game Status</div><br>\nGame over.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Deadline</div><br>\nN/a<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Player List</div><br>\n1.

General Etiquette</div><br>\na) Mafia is a game. Enjoy yourself! Being respectful will ensure other people also enjoy the game.<br>\nb) I do not mind mild personal attacks against another player. But if the other player requests you to stop, cease that type of behavior immediately.<br>\nc) You have been given a win condition. You are expected to play towards that win condition.<br>\nd) I am human, I can make mistakes. It is my first time modding. Please inform me if I do.<br>\ne) If you would like me to notice something in game, please post it in the format <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Mod: Hi!</div> or I may miss it.<br>\nf) Please do not post in the game if you are not a player.<br>\ng) I reserve the right to change or update any rules.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">2. Communication</div><br>\na) Do not discuss this game outside of this thread unless explicitly specified.<br>\nb) Do not quote your role PM or any moderator related communications. Paraphrasing is acceptable. Don't push it.<br>\nc) If you die, you are permitted one \"bah\" post with no game related content.<br>\nd) If you die, you will be given access to a dead quicktopic. Do not share this link with anyone.<br>\ne) Do not use any invisible/hard to read text or cryptography. <br>\nf) If you have the ability to edit you posts, don't. I will gladly edit any minor mistakes if you request it.<br>\ng) Mod posts will be in <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#8000BF\">bold purple</div></div>. Please do not use this color.<br>\nh) Flavor is provided purely for your entertainment purposes. I reserve the right to be lazy and not provide any flavor at all.<br>\ni) Scum may use their quicktopic for 48 hours once role PM's have been sent or until day 1 begins, which ever is longer.<br>\nj) All night actions must be submitted by PM as stated in your role PM, or they will not count.<br>\nk) Do not post if the thread is open if the mod has declared a lynch/opening scene is incoming.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">3. Voting</div><br>\na) Votes must be bolded, at the start of a line. I take no responsibility if your vote is not acknowledged if it is camouflaged in a wall of text.<br>\nb) Unvotes are nice but are not necessary.<br>\nc) Do not abuse voting to intentionally mislead other players. This includes fake hammers and such.<br>\nd) Abbreviations are acceptable as long as it is obvious who you are referring to.<br>\ne) A lynch occurs when a majority is reached. For an odd number of players, this is (n+1)/2. For an even number of players, this is (n/2)+1.<br>\nf) Posting is allowed in twilight, between the time a hammer is delivered and when I waltz in and kill the poor person.<br>\ng) Votes posted after the deadline has elapsed will not be counted.<br>\nh) If no majority is reached by the deadline, a No Lynch will occur.<br>\ni) You may vote for No Lynch. It requires a majority minus one votes to happen unless the game is in LYLO where it will require majority votes.<br>\nj) Votes by a player being replaced are defaulted to not voiting upon the replacement's arrival.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">4. Deadlines and Activity</div><br>\na) Day 1 will be 3 weeks. All subsequent days will have deadlines of 2 weeks.<br>\nb) Night 1 will have a maximum deadline of 72 hours and minimum deadline of 36 hours. All subsequent nights will have a minimum deadline of 24 hours, and maximum deadline of 48 hours.<br>\nc) You may request a deadline extension, it will require at least half of the majority of living players (minimum 2 players) to agree. Each extension will be no longer than 72 hours.<br>\nd) I may grant deadline extensions at my own discretion depending on the game situation, and replacements as such.<br>\ne) I reserve the right to shorten deadlines if game activity is minimal.<br>\nf) If no night actions are submitted by the time the maximum deadline expires, you will forfeit your action.<br>\ng) All night actions follow the <a href=\"https://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=NAR\" class=\"postlink\">Natural Action Resolution</a> system unless otherwise specified.<br>\nh) Please aim to post at least every 48 hours. You will receive a prod if you do not post within a 72 hour interval. You have 24 hours to respond to the prod via in-game post (or PM if thread locked) before you are replaced.<br>\ni) You will be automatically replaced if you receive 3 prods, or 2 prods in the same game day.<br>\nj) Please announce all V/LA's in thread or via PM. I will keep track of all V/LA's in vote counts.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">5. Consequences</div><br>\na) Minor rule infringements will result in a private warning.<br>\nb) Major or continued rule infringements will result in a modkill or force replacement.<br>\nc) If you are modkilled you will be turned into a Neutral Survivor and auto lossed.<br>\nd) Being force replaced or modkilled for any reasons (including inactivity) will result in future blacklistings from my games.<br>\n<br>\n<div align=\"center\"><hr style=\"height:14px;width:90%\"></div><div style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: normal; display: inline\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Sample Role PM's</div></div><br>\nYou know there exists at least 1 of each of the roles below.<br>\n<br>\n<fieldset style=\"border:3px outset grey;padding:5px 10px\"><legend style=\"text-transform:uppercase;margin:0 0.6em;padding:0em 0.33em\">Vanilla Townie Role</legend>Hi there <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Player</div>!<br>\n<br>\nWelcome to <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=16537&amp;start=0\" class=\"postlink\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Mini 1130</div></a>, A Fishbowl Invasion by Ninja Monkeys.<br>\n<br>\nIt seems you will have to rely on your wits and guts to find these Ninja Monkeys and rid your fishbowl community of these foul primates!<br>\n<br>\nYou are a <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF00\">Vanilla Townie</div></div>.<br>\n<br>\nDuring the day, you have one vote which you can use to further your agenda.<br>\nUnfortunately for you, you have no active nor passive abilities, bad luck!<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Active Abilities:</div> None<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Passive Abilities:</div> None<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Win Condition:</div> You win when all the Ninja Monkeys have been evicted from your fishbowl.<br>\n<br>\nConfirm via game post.<br>\nGood Luck!</fieldset><br>\n<fieldset style=\"border:3px outset grey;padding:5px 10px\"><legend style=\"text-transform:uppercase;margin:0 0.6em;padding:0em 0.33em\">Mafia Traitor Role</legend>Hi there <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Player</div>!<br>\n<br>\nWelcome to <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=16537&amp;start=0\" class=\"postlink\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Mini 1130</div></a>, A Fishbowl Invasion by Ninja Monkeys.<br>\n<br>\nIt seems you will have to rely on your cunning and deception abilities to eliminate the fishbowl community of all the goldfish!<br>\n<br>\nYou are a <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF0000\">Mafia Traitor</div></div>.<br>\n<br>\nDuring the day, you have one vote which you can use to further your agenda.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Active Abilities:</div> <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">*removed*</div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Passive Abilities:</div> You will be provided with a link to The Temple (scum night chat) if you are successfully targeted with <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Recruit</div>.

This was serious business.<br>\n<br>\nPreperations had been made, ideas sought and readiness was at a maximum.

I saw this as him thinking I was weak, but I returned the favor with my lol.<br>\n<br>\n[winger], 74 is just plain wrong. I never contradicted myself. DH was trying to form a wagon on me for what seem like a weak reason(stated above) which is why I lol'd and why I had no problem.<br>\n<br>\nCecily, it looks like you're trying to explain away your vote on me as RVS but 62 seems like it's not random.<br>\n<br>\nI need to read through again and figure out who to vote.</div></blockquote>\n\nDH's reasons were obviously weak because it was an RVS vote. Right now, you seem to be paranoid. You were overly worried about DH building an RVS wagon on you. In addition to that, you have done virtually no scum-hunting this far in the day. Admittantly, the day is still young, but you have posted quite a bit, and virtually all of your posts have been attempting to get suspision off of you, not trying to find other players who are scummy. Scum are usually worried more about their personal standing than they are about other people's standing.

Why so touchy, hmm? Granted I often draw a wagon on myself the first day, and maybe my play-style is at fault, but in my view people need to chill out (if they're town), and keep on being crazy to demonstrate your evil to everyone (if they're scum). <br>\n<br>\nParama: I gave my reason for not voting any of the first 3 suspicions, but I'll expand for you in case you don't like reading between the lines: \"<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">I'ma place my vote where it will count this early in the game.</div>\" There were already good wagons building up that will pressure a player, though neither bandwagon is particularly serious yet. I'm taking advantage of the flow of the game to put my vote where it can contribute to pressure, rather than strike out on an entirely new case. I might as well learn what I can learn from an effective bandwagon before moving to my next suspicions. <br>\n<br>\nBub: why not mention three players I'm suspicious of? I'm throwing some vibes out there in essentially my first post after RVS. I'll get to your question at the end fo this post.<br>\n<br>\nTwistedspoon: How is my suspicion of Parama a counter-suspicion? Are you suggesting that he was suspicious of me before I was suspicious of him, because I don't believe that's the case. As for the DH suspicion, I've seen gajillions of players on this site say that their gut didn't like something. Don't see what the problem is here. <br>\n<br>\nDemonHybrid: Reiterated Parama's argument (please see response above). <br>\n<br>\nAs for the Winger/Crazy debate, I thought all of the extensive and imaginative analysis on Crazy's \"lol\" was a load of crap. Winger started that, along with Parama and DH, and then hopped onto the vote after other players confirmed that they also found Pianist suspicious. He's not really taking a stance in the first accusation, and jumping to a vote in the second. (I agreed with AGar's interpretation of what happened.) <br>\n<br>\nI also agree with Oso's point here, in reference to Winger accusing Crazy of lying:\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Language is too strong for this early in the game</div></blockquote>\n\nI look at the beginning of the game as a time of uncertainty, and I look at players who express complete certainty with a smidgin of evidence as suspiciously knowledgable. (That's incidentally what I didn't like about Parama's play, but it's cropped up in his other games.) Here is an example of that smidgin of evidence from Winger:<br>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Oso, crazypianist contradicted himself (in my opinion) when he said he did not have a problem with the vote on him. That directly contradicts the tone set by the (what I'd consider) hostile/sarcastic \"Lol\" response he gave previously.</div></blockquote>\n\nSure now he's made it clear that it's his opinion (whereas before he directly accused him of lying), but he's still saying that \"Lol\" means something \"hostile/sarcastic\" based only on his imagination, and therefore Pianist is lying. There's a reason I didn't study literary criticism, and it's because projecting onto the text is annoying.<br>\n<br>\nAs for me, I interpret Pianist's \"Lol\" to be a subtle and brilliant accusation of DemonHybrid, for voting twice during the RVS. One player already suggested that voting twice destroys the pressure of RVS, Pianist was clearly tuned into this view of RVS, and elegantly accusing DemonHybrid of doing such. <br>\n<br>\nTo sum up, I completely agreed with Pianist that people were putting words in his mouth (possibly for ulterior motives), and I thought Winger was a huge part of that game. Additionally he had a bunch of pressure building on him, perfecto.

And I'm writing this as I'm reading so if I switch my ideas halfway through and forget to quote something, I'm sorry.<br>\n<br>\nI'll start with crazypianist because thats who you guys were calling me on before. Post 38-41, Crazy, winger, crazy, DH. Looking back, Crazy's \"lol\" seems perfectly harmless. It seems that DH took it to the next level by calling out a bandwagon on him. It seems like sarcasm and then a miscommunication of sarcasm that started the whole attack on crazy in the first place and now I just don't see it from that. It seems like winger joined onto the crazy train [lol] and tried to push it forward by intentionally making crazy seem suspicious by putting emotions behind his simple comment. \n<blockquote><div><cite>winger wrote:</cite>it seemed very much like crazypianist <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">did</div> have a problem with that vote</div></blockquote>\nAnd then theres the whole \"bluff\" thing. Seems more like a lack of time to think of a clever response and instead saying something stupid, rather than being blatantly scummy.<br>\n<br>\nParama then came in and went right along with winger, consciously or not, in putting words into crazy's mouth. <br>\nParama then starts sticking up for winger by taking his scumminess and saying \"nahh, what scumminess?\"\n<blockquote><div><cite>parama wrote:</cite>Plus, [winger] isn't flailing scum like crazy is, AND he's voting the flailing scum. If he's scum, he's helping us anyways  <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\"> </div></blockquote>\nThat seems more like and alignment than anything else thus far in the game (as of post 57)<br>\nAfter that comes winger. Post #68. I'm not certain at this point how much of his reasoning is suspicious versus how much is purely because he's a newbie, but since he claims to know the game, I can assume he knows at least most of what he's claiming and making himself seem like. <br>\nHe seems easily threatened, and comes back not with truly good reasoning, but with sentences that make it seem like he is being attacked personally. \n<blockquote><div><cite>winger wrote:</cite>At what point in the game does it stop being \"too early\" to use the word \"lie\"? This is an arbitrary attack on me.</div></blockquote>\nAnd then he switches back into the \"I'm new here, help me learn\" mode, so I'm confused.<br>\n<br>\nI'm questioning a Parama/winger alignment right now, because of Parama's post #83. He seemed to have no problems with winger's play style before he admitted that he'd never played a game before, but once that information was known he got defensive, maybe because winger being a new player threatens Parama's chance of a good scum game? Just thinking here. And then he jumped on me for unvoting crazy. He and winger had a (small) wagon on crazy at that point and it still seemed like the rest of the players weren't terribly convinced, yet when I pulled my RVS vote he wanted to accuse me of teaming up with crazy? I'm confused with that logic, but it doesn't seem very towny. <br>\n<br>\nAnd just to address it, Parama, you were putting words into crazy's mouth. \n<blockquote><div><cite>parama wrote:</cite>But you took it as a serious vote because you're paranoid.</div></blockquote>\nNo evidence, no valid point.<br>\n<br>\nI feel like Bub hasn't really been reading crazy's side of the argument because he continued to miss the sarcasm that was blatantly there. <br>\n<br>\nI've currently read up to page 4. So far my idea is that theres a scum hiding in the winger, parama, DH crazy wagon, because crazy just seems to be sarcastic. <br>\n<br>\nAnd then theres Sundy. His reason's against people were verging on idiotic and then he jumps onto a popular train. I don't think theres more that needs saying on that case. It's a stupid play style, but he does seem to redeem himself in post 108 and after that his ideas become much more easy to relate to. <br>\nSundy makes good points, such as :\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Sins of the newbie are sins of the newbie. However Winger's sins (casting aspersions on another player by inventing motives) seem more egregious than Pianist's (responding to his name listed in RVS).</div></blockquote>\nand then winger pulls the typical scum move and gets defensive about it not by defending himself but by stating that it absolutely cannot be. Wingers is a simple case of shouting something loud enough and strong enough that people will believe you. <br>\n<br>\nMy final reads on everyone<br>\nParama - his play style is aggressive, but it was the same in the last game I played with him and we ended up lynching him D1 and he was town, so I don't really want to risk that again.<br>\ncrazy - seems sarcastic, but otherwise not scummy. He's come back from being wagoned and defended himself with reason.<br>\nDH - seems less like a scum and more like he just doesn't pick up sarcasm very well. I'm willing to give the benefit of the doubt on this one and call town. <br>\nSundy - initially posted very poorly but has come back strong and now makes some valid points. <br>\nTwisted - seems to just be having a dandy old time. <br>\nBub - I don't think he understands sarcasm either/he doesn't read threads very carefully..  <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":roll:\" title=\"Rolling Eyes\"> <br>\nAGar - I'm liking his rationing. doesn't seem to have said anything scummy yet. <br>\nOso - I see nothing suspicious so far <br>\nAkira - I'll need more information<br>\nsordros - same lack of information<br>\nRBT - stop being ignorant and start playing the game that you're currently active in. <br>\nwinger - easily threatened, comes back with remarks that make it seem like everyone is personally attacking him.

{"number": 158, "id": "2844683", "user": "[winger]", "user_id": "15334", "content": "I think there is a good chance there was scum on my wagon. With 6 voters, and the weakness of the case against me, I don't see six townies jumping on the wagon. Which means I'd like to take a closer look at my wagoners:<br>\n<br>\nOso, Sundy, crazypianist1116, AGar, Akira, Cecily<br>\n<br>\nI just found that nifty isolation feature at the bottom of the page, so it's time for some fun! I'll try and make this as concise as possible:<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Oso:</div> His original jump onto voting me is weak. He admits that he finds crazypianist scummy, but his reasons for voting me in his first post are as follows: 1) I \"double RVSed\", 2) I used the word \"lie\" which is too strong, and 3) that I said DemonHybrid was the first person to mention the \"Lol\" post, which is true, but Oso implies it is false. The rest of his stuff seems rather&#8230; \"fluffy\". Empty. He asks for more votes on me, then questions me on my history on this website and playing this game in general, and multiple times makes comments in the light of protection his own image. He says things like, \"At the risk of being accused of overthinking\", or \"Call me paranoid\", or \"At the risk of starting an MD discussion\". This kind of language strikes me as off.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Sundy:</div> His first vote on me comes after he expresses suspicions of Bub Bidderskins, DemonHybrid, and Parama. However, he places his vote on me for two reasons: 1) it will \"count\" more on me, and 2) he believed the \"case\" on me is better than the pianist case. After he is called out on his unacceptable post, he clears things up a bit&#8230; though I'm not sure him calling pianist's \"Lol\" post a \"subtle and brilliant accusation of DemonHybrid, for voting twice during the RVS\". That is <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">quite</div> the stretch, and it kinda looks like, pardon my language, ass-kissing (if not outright uncalled for defense of a player). He calls my interpretation of pianist's \"Lol\" vote \"extensive and imaginative\" and \"a load of crap\"; but goes on to call the \"Lol\" vote itself \"brilliant\", \"subtle\", and \"elegant\". If he can interpret this so wildly, why is my interpretation any less valid?<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">crazypianist1116:</div> Aside from what has already been discussed (the \"Lol\" post, the flailing, the paranoia), his first vote on me was odd. He spends most of the previous posts attacking/respond to Parama &amp; DemonHybrid. He even calls DemonHybrid's post a \"bluff\". The only time he mentions me before his vote on me is here:\n<blockquote><div><cite>crazypianist1116 wrote:</cite>[winger], 74 is just plain wrong. I never contradicted myself. DH was trying to form a wagon on me for what seem like a weak reason(stated above) which is why I lol'd and why I had no problem.</div></blockquote>\nHe spends the rest of the time arguing with Parama/DemonHybrid, then decides to vote me by completely putting words in my mouth. He says:\n<blockquote><div><cite>crazypianist1116 wrote:</cite>[winger] don't try and say your question didn't imply you interpreted somehow other than a laugh. A laugh would mean I had no problem. Further your vote said I was contradicting myself which means you thought I had problems with DH.</div></blockquote>\nI never tried to say my \"question didn't imply I interpreted somehow other than a laugh\". The fact that I posted the question about his \"Lol\" vote obviously shows that I did not consider it to be a normal laugh, and I wanted to dig a bit deeper. This is a complete misrepresentation (and falsification) of what I said and implied. He saw that my wagon was taking off and tried to fabricate a reason to vote for me.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">AGar:</div> His original vote on me was fine, in my opinion. He expressed his opinion succinctly, and said that he thought I was trying to push a bandwagon without doing the work myself, essentially. That's a fair opinion, but then goes on to start chiming in with Oso going \"Moar winger votes, plz\". Then he gets off my wagon to vote Sundy&#8230; but after Sundy and crazypianist join my wagon, he puts his vote back on me, saying:\n<blockquote><div><cite>AGar wrote:</cite>Sundy still really caught my attention, and I'm not letting that one go, but [Winger] is just digging himself deeper and deeper, flailing about.</div></blockquote>\nNo explanation as to how I was digging myself deeper. He just pointed to two posts and said \"[winger] wagon is go\", then voted me. If someone he found suspicious, and isn't willing to let go, joined my wagon, shouldn't that give him MORE pause to not jump on the wagon with him?<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Akira:</div> He regurgitates other people's cases on me in order to make his own case, using cute buzzwords like \"flailing\". I'm not sure what to make of his vote on me. It came at quite the opportune moment on the wagon, and the fact he added pretty much nothing to the discussion seems like mafia who are trying to hop on a wagon without looking bad.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Cecily:</div> His case on me was muddled between tons of other stuff, so it's a little hard to pick out what he was actually saying.  He boiled it down to this:\n<blockquote><div><cite>Cecily wrote:</cite>winger - easily threatened, comes back with remarks that make it seem like everyone is personally attacking him. He also likes to say things as if they are facts when they truly are not.</div></blockquote>\nI'm not easily threatened, and there's no evidence for that. I never once suggested I was being personally attacked in an ad hominem way, which is what this implies. Furthermore, I state things as facts, but how does that make me suspicious? It's the way I talk/play. I assume my opinion is the most valid, because I'm the only person I know for sure is not a bad guy, thus that's how it comes across. I only put (in my opinion) in parenthesis because it wasn't obvious enough to everyone else that EVERYTHING someone says in this game is in their own opinion, barring some type of role-related information. More than that, though, he puts me at \"L-1\", and has no problem in doing so.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nI take issue with most of the people on my wagon, because a lot of it feels&#8230; forced, and weak. There was never a clearly stated case against me. It was just people bringing up a point, then someone else regurgitating it and turning it into a vote. Here is what happened with the \"Lol\" thing, from my perspective, to set things straight:<br>\n<br>\n- Crazy posts his \"Lol\" vote in response to DemonHybrid voting him in the RVS<br>\n- I question him on this, because it seemed like he took an issue with this vote<br>\n- Crazy denies having a problem with DemonHybrid's vote<br>\n- DemonHybrid points out the contradiction between the implied tone of \"Lol\" and the \"not having an issue statement\"<br>\n- Rather than responding, crazypianist says he is \"calling DemonHybrid's bluff\"<br>\n- I check the game again, see the developments, and vote crazypianist in my first non-random vote for the following reasons: 1) I believe he had a problem with the vote on him, which is suspicious since it is the random voting stage, and nobody else had shown an issue with any of the votes; 2) crazypianist said he didn't have a problem with the vote, which contradicts what I interpreted from his \"Lol\", and thus would make him lying<br>\n<br>\nThen, people start to suspect me for many reasons: randomly voting twice, attempting to start a lynchwagon on crazypianist (when all I did was question her \"Lol\" response, which is hardly starting a wagon), and even because I'm playing the \"newbie\" card. All of these reasons are weak and easily disproven (randomly voting twice doesn't really make one scummy since it's all random; I wasn't trying to start a wagon, I was just questioning something; and I'm not playing the \"newbie\" card, I'm asking honest questions about things I have never heard of/don't know&#8230;I'm not a total newbie, I've played this game before).<br>\n<br>\nThe wagon on me was full of people I'd like to lynch, but here's my preferred order:<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Most Want to Lynch</div><br>\ncrazypianist1116<br>\nCecily = Sundy<br>\nAGar<br>\nAkira<br>\nOso<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Least Want to Lynch</div><br>\n<br>\ncrazypianist's ignoring of my pressure on him, and waiting until there were two votes on me already to \"safely\" join the wagon is what sits worse with me. Cecily putting me in danger of being lynched is bad, but I can't decide if its worse than Sundy's arbitrary and elaborate defense of crazypianist's \"Lol\" post while hypocritically telling me my interpretation of the \"Lol\" post was too imaginative.", "time": "Tue Mar 01, 2011 12:57 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=16537&start=150", "forum": "53", "thread": "16537"}

You could've possibly avoided the claim that way. This is of course if you're telling the truth.<br>\nIf you were waiting, then why did you want to claim at L-2?</div></blockquote>\nNo... I was one vote away from being lynched. If I had waited and someone hadn't said they were going to vote me and had just voted me instead, then I wouldn't have had an opportunity to claim. I didn't want to miss my chance to claim due to a quick lynch, that's why I wanted to claim at L-2.<br>\n<br>\nFurthermore, I'm not buying the explanation for the slip from Akira. It seems too blatant. When I look back at the slip and then look at the explanation, I see nowhere the hint that \"If I'm wrong, he's dead tonight\" was how it was supposed to come across. I do believe Akira when he says he rushed typing it, which explains why he slipped so easily.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Akira wrote:</cite>Finally, if I haven't made this clear enough I do suspect winger, for his strange behavior at L-2, but lynching him now is pointless because 3 things could happen tonight:<br>\n1) He gets NKed - We'll know the truth (duh)<br>\n2) He survives - Not confirmed scum but pretty close, at least for me.<br>\n3) No NK - He's the doc.</div></blockquote>\nI have to doublecheck something to respond to the first sentence.

That was one minor inconvenience.<br>\n<br>\nThen there was the issue of resources. It would be a challenge for a handful of asses to be able to sustain a production of fart gases enough to asphyxiate their target. So obviously now, this method of murder was now out of the question.<br>\n<br>\nAhh! They had a brain wave! And they thanked the heavens for blessing them with a higher IQ than those pathetic goldfish.<br>\n<br>\nSo unknown to the clueless goldfish who were still figuring out how to get some shut eye, they sneakily phoned the Climate Police Hotline to tip them off about the gross violations that had occurred during the death of Akira.<br>\n<br>\nAnd in a hail of sirens, the Climate Police arrived in their solar powered submarines. Eager to get back to their donuts and hotdogs, they attempted to arrest the first suspect they saw, [winger]. Of course, [winger] resisted arrest, and they were left with no option but to pepper spray him. But without eyelids, and hence the inability to close them, the pain drove [winger] crazy causing him to gouge his own eyeballs out.

That was one minor inconvenience.<br>\n<br>\nThen there was the issue of resources. It would be a challenge for a handful of asses to be able to sustain a production of fart gases enough to asphyxiate their target. So obviously now, this method of murder was now out of the question.<br>\n<br>\nAhh! They had a brain wave! And they thanked the heavens for blessing them with a higher IQ than those pathetic goldfish.<br>\n<br>\nSo unknown to the clueless goldfish who were still figuring out how to get some shut eye, they sneakily phoned the Climate Police Hotline to tip them off about the gross violations that had occurred during the death of Akira.<br>\n<br>\nAnd in a hail of sirens, the Climate Police arrived in their solar powered submarines. Eager to get back to their donuts and hotdogs, they attempted to arrest the first suspect they saw, [winger]. Of course, [winger] resisted arrest, and they were left with no option but to pepper spray him. But without eyelids, and hence the inability to close them, the pain drove [winger] crazy causing him to gouge his own eyeballs out.

They thought team bonding actives would help relieve the bottled up hate. <br>\n<br>\nSo grudgingly, everyone decided to participate in a charades night. That didn't work too well because the actor kept on forgetting what phrase they were trying to perform while the players just abused the actor for their horrendous acting skills. It kinda made things worse.<br>\n<br>\nSynchronized swimming was the next activity they decided to try. Unfortunately that too turned out to be a complete failure. Once seeing some of the townspeople in their swimming outfits which highlighted their <div style=\"display:inline-flex;text-decoration:line-through\">ugliness</div> sexiness which was usually well masked by everyday clothing, many ran straight to the toilet to throw up, which unfortunately was perceived as an insult. So the emotions flared once again.<br>\n<br>\nMeanwhile, Cecily continued to disagree with the general consensus of team bonding, and decided to take her own approach to the issue. She had heard of the saying, ignorance is bliss, and now would be the perfect opportunity to test this.<br>\n<br>\nAnd with that thought, she began forging her new identity, Ceily the Seal, complete with plastic surgery and all. She had prepared a test run and was adamant no one would be able to recognize her, and therefore she could forgo all the problems in the community and hopefully live in blissful, if not naive peace.<br>\n<br>\nHowever, the society consumed with rage of the death of [winger] had decided a new approach to soothe the issue on hand. What better way to release all the locked up anger than to release it?<br>\n<br>\nAnd then someone noticed a cute little seal bouncing around the fishbowl. It seemed the stars had aligned and the heavens had delivered this gift to all, knowing it would help ease the crisis.

Were they next to die?<br>\n<br>\nMeanwhile, the monkeys, taken aback by the ruthlessness of the killing of one of their own shuddered in the thought of the coming days. They could be next to die...<br>\n<br>\nSo the goldfish thought it would be wise to take some defensive action. And the idea to hire a bodyguard to protect them was put in motion. Unfortunately, the sorrow of the death of now two of their friends had caused many of them to revert back to their alcoholic ways in an attempt to relieve the burden. With all their life savings spent on cheap goon, they were penniless and it seemed they would have to improvise.<br>\n<br>\nAnd when the master of the ninja monkeys discovered that they had let one of their own die, he was consumed with rage. He cut all their weekly pocket money, so now the monkeys were without a cent. It would be a challenge to kill with no money, actually near impossible. Maybe someone else could do their dirty work for them... So some improvisation was necessary.<br>\n<br>\nAnd the next day on pokemonXXX.com, two brand new classifieds appeared.<br>\n<br>\n\"A school Magikarp is looking for a Gyrados to dominate them. Requires someone with vivid imagination and wild tendencies! xxx &lt;3.<br>\nPlease email ninjamonkeys69(at)gmail.com\"<br>\n<br>\n\"Lonely Magikarp seeks an aggressive Gyrados for some naughty adventures. Being strong and fearsome are very admirable and attractive traits. xoxo &lt;3. <br>\nCall 1800Fish69 any time after 3pm.\"<br>\n<br>\nReading the classifieds of pokemonXXX.com that morning was Team Rocket looking for their next poor Pokemon to exploit. With the global financial crisis, they too were victims of budget cuts. Their lack of funding meant their pet cat, Meowth hadn't had a feed for several days, they could barely even feed themselves...<br>\n<br>\nAnd those two ads immediately caught their attention. Magikarp were very valuable and rare after all if they recalled correctly, which must meant they were a delicacy. And how convenient, after contacting both parties, they were at the same location. Perfect.<br>\n<br>\nThey immediately departed to the fishbowl community with their \"Old Rods\" all prepared. The fish were so plentiful here, it would be like shooting fish in a barrel, a walk in the park. <br>\n<br>\nAnd almost immediately they had their first catch. Meowth was dying for a feed, and was exuberant! But that was weird, this Magikarp had four legs and a tail ... it actually looked more like a monkey. Meowth took one nibble ... it tasted like monkey too. Meowth no like monkeys, he want fish. So back in the fishbowl this weird Magikarp went.<br>\n<br>\nTheir second catch was much more successful. It wasn't exactly a Magikarp, but hey it looked like a fish. And tasted like one too.<br>\n<br>\nMeowth would have a feast tonight.<br>\n<br>\nMaemuki wouldn't though.

When Parama said this in response to my statement that only VTs calim VT D1,\n<blockquote><div><cite><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2846509#p2846509\" class=\"postlink\">Parama [url=https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2846509#p2846509]Post - 190[/url]</a> wrote:</cite>..<br>\nFunnily enough, town almost always lynches VT claims D1 regardless! &lt;_&lt;<br>\n..</div></blockquote>\nHe was basically stating what happens D1 to VT claims..\"the person who claims VT D1, loses.\"<br>\n<br>\nHad Akira been the first person to claim D1, instead of Winger, I wouldn't have even considered voting him after his claim. Pressure cooking the next scummiest player would have been what I would have thought. But since he had the bad luck to be forced to claimed after a claimed PR, he lost.<br>\n<br>\nSee <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2859149#p2859149\" class=\"postlink\">Post - 337</a> for the second part.<br>\n<br>\nAs to dragging you into this? Unavoidable. To get DH to respond, I had to look at, and answer the questions he posed (they were at AGar rather than me, oh well). You are #5 on the Akira wagon. I didn't \"drag you into this\". Your positioning on the Akira wagon and DH's question did that. Pos 5 on a 7 person wagon would qualify as a \"late\" vote, in my opinion and that was one of the things DH was asking AGar to look at.<br>\n<br>\nThat part you quoted \"<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">I know why I don't like either of those players at the moment...\"</div> is directly related to Bub and crazy. It isn't meant to include you although I do admit that the way I structured it makes it look I am including you with crazy in that sentence.

Look at the state of the game at that point and put yourself back in that day, take the Akira/Cecily flips out of your mind. If she gets any more flustered, there is a good chance the Akira wagon could transfer over to her. A town flip of Cecily strengthens any defense Akira gives the next day. Failing that, since Akira probably is going to be lynched at that point, Bub isn't the real driving force behind the lynch at that point. Parama is. Any accusations of \"too easy, that must have been a bus\" fall on Parama and perhaps DH as the wagon starter, but not on Bub, he has insured that he prominent at casting suspicions at Akira but he hasn't voted Akira, he is being courteous to Parama by 'holding off'.<br>\n<br>\nThe final thing, as this more nebulous and more subjective but it stares out at me really badly, is that he(Bub) never does really give anyone the honest benefit of the doubt, like I said above except for here:\n<blockquote><div><cite>Bub Bidderskins wrote:</cite>I'm not really buying the case on DH. Personally, I think he's town. I don't read his reference to Parama as deflection. I think he's got a valid point in that Parama basically said the same thing he did and Agar didn't latch onto him. The fact is that Cecily was such a prime target for a lynch that scum could have just sat back and watched.</div></blockquote>\nBut that is tainted. Bub was the hammer on Cecily so any defense he makes of another person on the wagon, is, by proxy, a defense of himself. If he can diffuse AGar's reasons for voting DH, he also does the same thing for himself should attention turn to him. He's not giving DH the benefit of the doubt there, he's covering his own ass.<br>\n<br>\nI've already went over in other posts what I thought of his hammer of Cecily, in addition to what I put above, so I won't rehash that.

Any accusations of \"too easy, that must have been a bus\" fall on Parama and perhaps DH as the wagon starter, but not on Bub, he has insured that he prominent at casting suspicions at Akira but he hasn't voted Akira, he is being courteous to Parama by 'holding off'.</div></blockquote>\n\nVirtually the entire case on Cecily revolved around Akira being scum. If Akira flipped town, then the case on Cecily would fall flat. If you had read the thread, you would have known this. Of course, you have already demonstrated an inability to read the thread through, so this doesn't come as a surprise...<br>\n<br>\nNot reading the thread isn't necessarily scummy, but it seems like every time Oso mis-reads or mis-represents something, it's always in his favor. It feels more like scum trying to re-write history than an honest mistake.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Oso wrote:</cite>The final thing, as this more nebulous and more subjective but it stares out at me really badly, is that he(Bub) never does really give anyone the honest benefit of the doubt, like I said above except for here:\n<blockquote><div><cite>Bub Bidderskins wrote:</cite>I'm not really buying the case on DH. Personally, I think he's town. I don't read his reference to Parama as deflection. I think he's got a valid point in that Parama basically said the same thing he did and Agar didn't latch onto him. The fact is that Cecily was such a prime target for a lynch that scum could have just sat back and watched.</div></blockquote>\nBut that is tainted. Bub was the hammer on Cecily so any defense he makes of another person on the wagon, is, by proxy, a defense of himself. If he can diffuse AGar's reasons for voting DH, he also does the same thing for himself should attention turn to him. He's not giving DH the benefit of the doubt there, he's covering his own ass.</div></blockquote>\n\nYou're right; it is nebulous and subjective. I think DH is town because I think he's town.

It's not WIFOM really. But consider this, killing you confirms your motivations. That can be considered by some to strengthen my claim since you risked a lynch of yourself by doing it. Keeping you alive puts both of our claims in doubt. Mine because the case could be made that you are town that backed off my lynch for townie reasons and that is being taken advantage of. Yours because you used gambit to save a townie for cred that paid off.<br>\n<br>\nThe first is more likely than the second, in my opinion, from every POV but mine. But overall, scum get more doubt in the game by leaving us both alive if we are both town because when your alignment is confirmed as town, my claim is auto-strengthened to a certain extent because you had no scum motivation for what you did. A case could certainly be made that you were wrong to back off and I am still scum, but having a townie almost take the rope to save you is a pretty powerful tool in the hands of the person you did it for.<br>\n<br>\nThe opposite is true. As scum, you would get even further cred by having me NKed at some point but not the night after you saved me. That borders on too transparent.

Don't assume that I think are three men plus 1 traitor just because I disagree with Agar at this point. My disagreement there is a caution. It can't hurt town at all to think there are still 2 scum left if there is only 1. A correct lynch is desirable in either situation.<br>\n<br>\nThink for a minute about what you said though: A player says 'Town is in a good position as I think there is only one scum left...'

I plead tiredness.<br>\n<br>\n@DH<br>\nTo the above quote, I looked. I don't see that anyone still alive had any reason to think Parama was a direct threat them.<br>\n<br>\nAside from D1, he never starts a case on his own. The exception is Day 3. He was first vote on my wagon but even if you take his flip out of the equation, the vote he made of me wasn't a serious threat to me. The initial reasoning was weak, almost non-existent, and he never does come in to help support it. At L-1, Parama chiming back in would probably have gotten me lynched. Unlike Akira and Cecily before and RBT after, he has no easy 'out'. Mine wouldn't have been a slam dunk lynch and on my flip, everyone who was on it would have come under much greater scrutiny with their reasoning and he knew it. Added evidence, the way he switches to TS when he(TS) unvotes. Parama is the first on this as well. He's looking for easy lynches or lynches he can get started and slink away from.<br>\n<br>\nHe went after crazy pretty hard D1 but never went back to it so I don't see crazy as having anything to fear from him either. Especially as he takes almost all pressure off crazy when he votes me: \"<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">....some late D1/early D2 posts make me believe crazy is town...</div>\"<br>\n<br>\nHe has a various points, made connections: Akira/Cecily, [winger](scum) to crazy(traitor), Sundy(scum) if crazy(scum), Oso/Sundy...I may have missed one or two, he threw a lot of them around.<br>\n<br>\nHe's like an erratic wind, changing directions at random.<br>\n<br>\nYour theory: I can find no such player as you describe, except maybe me. Certainly no one else alive had even a small reason to fear him for his case building skills this game. But, even before his flip, by the way he was posting and throwing votes around, anyone at L-1 with Parama holding the hammer would have had plenty to fear from him. So someone pro-actively taking him out of play for that reason makes some sense.<br>\n<br>\nWho did you find, using your theory?", "time": "Wed Mar 16, 2011 12:29 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=16537&start=525", "forum": "53", "thread": "16537"}

I only threw the theory out there and then went to class.<br>\n<br>\nThe fact that TS didn't die when he was basically considered obvtown, and instead, Parama dying, shows SOME urgency to kill him. It wasn't a random kill, it most likely had motivation behind it. I hope that much is clear.<br>\n<br>\nIt seems what's up for debate right now is \"How can anyone see him as a threat if he hasn't really threatened anyone as of late?\" and, in response to that, I think that the scum who killed him was pressured by him sometime in the past, knows how sharp of a town player he is (or at least was at the brunt of his lashing earlier on in the game) and felt the need to waste him. Either that, or TS's reads are completely off, though I personally think that TS has been steadily improving.<br>\n<br>\nThis scum is somewhat competent. Assuming it was a fear kill, they know that it would be certain death to kill him right after they were pressured by him. It'd be too easy to do the linking. The good play would be to wait a while after the pressure, then waste him when they have some leeway in pressure. I still believe in my theory that it was someone that Parama pressured earlier on in the game, because once the number of suspects start to narrow, that suspicion would naturally arise again. It seems almost entirely too characteristic of both Parama's play and the level of expertise of everyone left in the game.<br>\n<br>\nThe HoS on Sundy kinda weirds me out a little bit...everyone who's alive that has had heat from Parama before was voted or butted heads with him for a short time, but only one HoS. So again, he would be my top suspect. I know this is a meta-reliable statement, but Parama definitely seems like the kind of guy who would have a bus-fest if he was a traitor. Call it a hunch, gut, whatever. But it's further supported by the fact that TS isn't dead, which I thought would be the obvious kill last night. It can't be random; the two theories support each other, and this last paragraph of theory is just a supplement to find out who is most likely to pull a move like this, and a slip-bus (which was originally obliviousness to Akira) + HoS seems to be right up his alley. Maybe it's not so erratic as you'd believe.<br>\n<br>\nAlso, as stated in the parentheses above, note that Akira was hardly mentioned if at all by Parama before I pointed out his slip, and Sundy had gotten a HoS by that point. Ignored scum + HoS, with votes on other players seems so extremely likely to me.", "time": "Wed Mar 16, 2011 12:59 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=16537&start=525", "forum": "53", "thread": "16537"}

The MAX he did was say Parama's accusations may not have been erratic, and that Parama may have been killed because he was a wildcard in general. Here are fairly representative quotes:<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>DemonHybrid wrote:</cite>They probably saw Parama as more of a threat, hence my theory.</div></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Oso wrote:</cite>@DH<br>\nTo the above quote, I looked. I don't see that anyone still alive had any reason to think Parama was a direct threat them. ....Your theory: I can find no such player as you describe, except maybe me. Certainly no one else alive had even a small reason to fear him for his case building skills this game. But, even before his flip, by the way he was posting and throwing votes around, anyone at L-1 with Parama holding the hammer would have had plenty to fear from him. So someone pro-actively taking him out of play for that reason makes some sense. </div></blockquote>\n\nYou're trying to argue that we can find scum by looking at who Parama pressured. Happily Oso has not expressed support for that theory. This is happy partly because it's a bad theory and partly--even if you assume this was the reason for the NK-- there's no reason it should point to a specific player. Why me, and not you once he turned on you? Why assume he was killed in response to pressure, and not assume Parama was buddying scum, as Pianist suggests? The problem with your approach is that you're trying to figure out what a dead player meant to convey, and eating NK speculation as the cherry on top. Fuzzy fuzz fuzz.<br>\n<br>\nPlease make a case that doesn't involve you interpreting Parama's posts willy-nilly as you see fit. Same goes for Oso. But the difference between your two approaches is that he's considering every possibility even horribly unlikely ones (and I already acknowledged my mistake: you didn't say scum intentionally killed their partner), whereas you've latched onto one, even when presented with contradictory arguments.

It had AGar, TS and Parama in it.<br>\n<br>\nPost Parama flip: My thoughts, <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">\"Shit, I didn't see that coming.\"</div> I had thought his erratic voting was indicative of the only playstyle I had seen from him up to that point. He was town in that game. Faced with a scum flip, I had reverse that and think <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">\"...ok, so he does the same things as scum too.\"</div> So I did not think Parama was scum pre-flip. I didn't even consider that he was anything but meta-neutral in his playstyle post flip until DH said that maybe his being erratic wasn't erratic at all. That is part of what prompted the re-read of Parama. Him and CP both saying telling to me to calm down a bit and start thinking again was the other part.<br>\n<br>\nAs to knowledge of him knowing 100% the team lay out re:who is town and who is scum? The Wiki: <a href=\"http://mafiascum.net/wiki/index.php?title=Traitor\" class=\"postlink\">http://mafiascum.net/wiki/index.php?title=Traitor</a>. RBT I think it was, mentioned it earlyish in the game as well.<br>\n<br>\nI don't care what you think. I do care that the rest of the players understand why and how I went from no previously voiced suspicion at all to certain scum.<br>\n<br>\nAs to the speculation being a scum-slip? I'll throw some of your tactics back at you? Why would I, as scum, point out that we deliberately killed our traitor knowing he was traitor when AGar, in the first post of the day, states that he thinks town is in a good position.<br>\n<br>\nYou asked me earlier what reason I could possible put forth that would explain it. That's it. Kill the traitor, get the town complacent, say \"Man we got it whipped now...\". The short answer is that I wouldn't even introduce that if I knew that Parama had been deliberately killed, I'd have agreed wholeheartedly with AGar.<br>\n<br>\nThat's why I finally came to the conclusion it was a mistake that Parama was killed rather than deliberate. A kill of a townie last night puts us in lylo today. 4:3. So the initial shock of having Parama, a player I'd have thought would be a good player for an early recruitment attempt, show up dead immediately triggered a 'knee-jerk' \"No way in hell that happened by accident\" response.<br>\n<br>\nIt was a mistake because the person he tried to tell (you Sundy), didn't pick up on it  or something interfered with recruitment, and you killed him by mistake.", "time": "Thu Mar 17, 2011 10:23 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=16537&start=575", "forum": "53", "thread": "16537"}

Hey, remember when Parama saved Oso by deflecting the wagon onto Twisted?<br>\n3. Communication between Parama and Oso?<br>\n4. Defeatism<br>\n5. Loves to think like scum<br>\n6. Tries to claim that Twisted's alignment means he's innocent<br>\n7. Forgot about (inferior) Bub case<br>\n<br>\nI don't think it's all plausible that scum intentionally killed off the traitor, and I thought it very bizarre when Oso claimed as much in a p-edit. I doubt he'd have had to back himself into a corner with <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2879637#p2879637\" class=\"postlink\">posts</a> like <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2880100#p2880100\" class=\"postlink\">these</a> if he hadn't included that p-edit. In my mind this is part of a larger pattern of thinking like scum.* (Look for the * for more thinking like scum.)<br>\n<br>\nWhen I asked him where he came up with this crazy idea, he said he'd go do some research on how this could possibly occur:<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Oso wrote:</cite>In addition to getting a much longer post together at the moment, I'm also looking for actions that I would expect to see if Parama was intentionally NKed and they knew he was the traitor. Not finding anything worth bringing out except as an 'in case' scenario. 'In case' we flip scum today or tomorrow and the game doesn't end.</div></blockquote>\n\nBut all he comes up with is that Mafia wanted to lull town into complacency and so they killed one of their own. Now if someone can find ONE SINGLE EXAMPLE of that tactic happening on these forums, let me know. But I'd wager it's never happened, and personally I don't think any town-aligned player would come up with that theory, and--after being pressured on it--Oso now seems to have abandoned it. <br>\n<br>\nNOW: THERE IS ONE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT CONCLUSION FROM THIS ANALYSIS. It is this: that <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Parama was never successfully recruited</div> (unless there's another killer at work). Please keep this in mind for the future.<br>\n<br>\nIt's been correctly pointed out by many that looking at Parama is a helpful thing for town to do. I completely agree, but I think players are being far too quick to make something of his scum reads etc., even though in the third post of the game, he made it CLEAR that he KNEW would be analyzed after dying. So it is probably in town's best interest to realize that it's gonna be SUPER TRICKY to sort out the WIFOM!! <br>\n<br>\nHowever, there is one interesting thing to note about Parama's behavior: When Oso was at the height of his pressure, Twisted unvoted. Less than 10 posts later, Parama was starting a Twisted wagon. This builds up and up, we all know what happened, and then the pressure's off of Twisted. And instantly Oso decides that he's \"unpressurized enough to go on,\" even though none of the arguments against him had been answered. And I know he's busy with work, but too bad he couldn't step in to defend Twisted during that whole process. <br>\n<br>\nNow, let's take a closer look at Parama's actual vote of Twisted:<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Parama wrote:</cite>Twisted knows Oso won't flip scum, because Twisted's the mafia traitor.<br>\nAnd he wants to chain lynches to ensure a scum victory. Since he knows Oso is town, the second statement is there so he can push AGar tomorrow for a \"valid\" reason.</div></blockquote>\n\nAnd the day before Parama's vote, Oso had this to say: \n<blockquote><div><cite>Oso wrote:</cite>We still have an unknown number of scum out there but there is at least one more mafia and the traitor. </div></blockquote>\n\nSay the recruitment of Parama didn't go through the first day (a possibility Oso goes AT LENGTH to disprove in his posts). Say Oso knows this because he is scum. Day 2, scum try someone else-- it doesn't work. On Day 3, Oso says the traitor is still out there, and Parama responds with a vote on Twisted that mentions the mafia traitor. He says that Twisted is the traitor because he \"knows\" Oso won't flip scum. What if Parama is the traitor, deflecting blame from Oso, and then pointing out AGAIN that he's the traitor, because he \"knows\" Oso IS scum?? <br>\n<br>\nAgain this is all SPECULATION, but I don't know as it's any different from Oso's speculation right <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2884761#p2884761\" class=\"postlink\">#577</a>. It seems like a lot stronger case to me that this interaction is a signal, because it's the FIRST time Parama mentions the traitor since his flurry of posts in the beginning of the game, and it's explicitly saying that Twisted is the traitor because Oso is innocent i.e. Twisted is not the traitor because Oso is scum because Parama is the traitor. QED. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">VOTE: Oso</div><br>\n<br>\n*Add to this was the defeatist attitude that he had while the pressure was building on him, looks like a guilty conscience to me: <br>\n\"I know you've blown the call on me but ,eh, trying to convince you of that is probably not going to work.\"<br>\n\"This probably seals my lynch.\" <br>\n\"To answer any doubts about my stance on any of the players at the moment\"<br>\n<br>\n*And in general there are lots of examples of him thinking from a  scummy mindset and sharing that with the class, and posts like these: <br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Oso wrote:</cite>Look at the state of the game at that point and put yourself back in that day, take the Akira/Cecily flips out of your mind. If she gets any more flustered, there is a good chance the Akira wagon could transfer over to her. A town flip of Cecily strengthens any defense Akira gives the next day. Failing that, since Akira probably is going to be lynched at that point, Bub isn't the real driving force behind the lynch at that point. Parama is. Any accusations of \"too easy, that must have been a bus\" fall on Parama and perhaps DH as the wagon starter, but not on Bub, he has insured that he prominent at casting suspicions at Akira but he hasn't voted Akira, he is being courteous to Parama by 'holding off'.</div></blockquote>\n\n*Or the time that he said Twisted being a confirmed townie means that he's a confirmed townie. When Twisted responded by saying \"WTF are you talking about, I'm still suspicious of you\" (I'm paraphrasing), he says: <br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Oso wrote:</cite>The second we get a town flip on either you or me, the other becomes almost unlynchable.</div></blockquote>\n\nNot to mention that his gigantic Bub suspicion (which he'd already forgot about once when he decided to go after DH), he's now dropped again in favor of a case on me. <br>\n<br>\nOH, and about his Bub case. The main reason it was so much weaker than Bub's case on him (and Oso really picked up the Bub case only after Bub started accusing him, very OMGUS) is that he singled out Bub as being responsible for the Cecily lynch. Notice how PARAMA didn't get called out for that, despite being 2x as responsible. Oso's case on Bub never made sense to me in that regard. <br>\n<br>\nThen from his giant ISO #40 where he voted Bub, by his ISO #44 he's changed his mind ONLY because he's still alive and Bub would have killed him, and basically he drops the Bub suspicion. And now he's onto his next suspicion.<br>\n<br>\nPersonally I think we should hang him high right now.<br>\n<br>\nI voted above in case you missed it in the awesomeness of the case.", "time": "Thu Mar 17, 2011 12:18 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=16537&start=575", "forum": "53", "thread": "16537"}

As evidenced by your post-mortem analysis of Parama's posts, you missed his cues about being the traitor, even though you were looking for them (just as I'm sure you were looking for cues when the traitor was still alive). After you killed him and realized you'd dealt your team a mortal blow, your brain went into shock and you started inventing impossibilities, hence your distress and confusion at the beginning of Day 4. <br>\n<br>\nI just want to quickly address your case on me.<br>\nDuring all of page 2 in your ISO, you have nothing to say aside that I'm \"dead neutral\" and variations thereof<br>\nDay 4, #<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2882523#p2882523\" class=\"postlink\">51</a>: You use me to prove that Parama was fighting with lots of people \"like an erratic wind,\" no suspicion voiced.

It's a similar read that Twistedspoon gave to me. After giving a good interpretation of my play, you inexplicably ditch it on a re-read. Only because you need someone to vote. So after listing reasons why it would be INCREDIBLY easy for me to hammer you, and suggesting that I don't hammer because I'm \"unsure town,\" you then decide I'm not town and I was just exhibiting paranoia instead. This accusation is essentially a town-read disguised as a scum-read.\n<blockquote><div><cite>Oso wrote:</cite>What I think is telling is that he doesn't vote me. I'm below the scum line in Post-376 and even though I don't agree with Bub's points against me, some are defensible. Sundy could have totally sheeped Bub's case and in the next day hash-up of the lynch, made Bub look like the bad guy (Parama could have probably done the same). The only reasons I can think he didn't do so is because of paranoia or he is unsure town (&lt;-that is what I was initially going with when Sundy didn't vote me: That he was unsure town). In light of a re-read, I don't think that anymore.</div></blockquote>\n\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">My suspicion about your reaction to Parama's death</div><br>\nUh, this is little more than disguised OMGUS. You acknowledge that other people also found this suspicious and even voted you for it, but for some reason you single me out. Why?

Half the reason I went after Bub is because I've seen him post in games and outside of them, he knows how to think. The only reason I could come up with him hammering Cecily was that he was scum and I let that cloud my thinking. I did what he did except he didn't stop to think in regards to Cecily and I didn't stop to think there was another reason he was voting Cecily other than it was an easy lynch. He simply got up in the momentum that was fueled by the D1 lynch of scum.<br>\n<br>\nAgar or DH might conceivably change their votes to me, but I'd only expect to see that if crazy didn't come in and solve it or if he showed up and couldn't make a decision but I don't see that happening. crazy doesn't look like he has any problems making up his mind.<br>\n<br>\nSo things are good for me from where I sit. If crazy comes in and votes me, it is game over when you guys lynch Sundy tomorrow. If he votes Sundy, then game over tonight and I get to start making fun of Sundy for missing Parama's message to him that much sooner although I'm guessing Parama has already, or still is, ripping him a new one in the Dead Thread , if Enigma made one.<br>\n<br>\nLife, as far as mafia goes, is good today.

Quit being so paranoid about your own survival. While alive, hunt scum (or lynch townies depending on what you are that game). When dead keep up with the game and enjoy. If you get into this situation again, where you are alive and you think you should be dead, try and figure out why.<br>\n<br>\nYou came up with one on your own except that really only works if you are dead. DH came up with another. You are not dead because there was a more dangerous person on the hit list. Mine was another: That you are being kept alive for a specific purpose.<br>\n<br>\nAfter the game is over, you might find it was a mish-mash of all the reasons you could think of and others came up with, or it could be none of them.

We should have 2 tries before we hit lylo, I would think. It strikes me as highly unlikely that we started with 3 scum + 1 traitor, as that gives us ~2/3 mislynches to work with, depending on how things work out. Even without a recruited traitor, 3 mafiosos gives scum a pretty good position to go into a mylo-esque situation on D2.<br>\n<br>\nIf anyone has anything exciting from the night actions, now would be an optimal time to tell us, as we (again - by my own estimates) should be in a 6:1 scenario.</div></blockquote>And that would only kick in if we flipped a scum and the game didn't end. Up until that point, AGar remains a town read to me.<br>\n<br>\nThe only other 3 I had suspicions on were Bub, CP and DH. CP was the hammer on Akira and I had stated that I wanted to give him (Akira) a chance to speak before I hammered. cp prevented that. It looked like a scum hammering to cut off discussion and get whatever town cred he could by helping lynch scum. Plus, I never brought this out even though I made a post that had cp suspicions in it, I thought he might be the traitor. If DH had ever flipped scum or CP ever flipped as the traitor, I would have brought that reasoning out. It was too weak to hold any validity in cases against either player without 1)one of them flipped at some point or 2)Some sort connection between the two that didn't rely on one or the other of them being a certain role. Just \"scum\". Parama's death blew that all to hell. CP can't be the traitor so anything I saw that I thought was a connection between the two that relied on CP being the traitor didn't work any more.<br>\n<br>\nBesides, as I said, they both helped get my thinking back on track this morning. Hard to think bad thoughts about either one of them at the moment. The only real case I had on CP was nebulous(and now disproven) in one part and one instance of being what could be described as opportunistic scum as the other part. DH. Same thing. His early Day 3 posts did look like deflection onto Parama and he phrased a situation to look for that led me right back to my \"Bub and CP look like dandy lynches\" of the end of day 2.<br>\n<br>\nBub, even at that point, still looked like the best prospect for catching scum based on actions alone though. Once through helping AGar grill him, I'd have went after Bub. Unless DH totally cracked though, there was no chance he was getting my vote D3.<br>\n<br>\nBub, I thought he had taken advantage of an easy lynch. As I said earlier, he strikes me as pretty decent in the thinking department and the only reason I could come up with at the time was that he was taking advantage of an easy lynch. I made the decision to do just what I accused him of not doing with Cecily, I gave him enough benefit to lay off him, at least for a bit. The whole \"both of us were still alive thing\" isn't a lie or even WIFOMy, we'd be a a scum \"dream team\" in lylo if we were both there and town, if we kept on attacking each other and neither of us managed to lynch the other. Something neither of us managed to do Day 3. He came closer to lynching me than I did him though.<br>\n<br>\nI'd blown the call on winger, I thought he was scum despite backing off his D1 claim. I thought Akira was town, he wasn't. I thought RBT was scum when I came back from V/LA. I knew from the lynch post and the front page she was town but reading the thread, had I been present, TS wouldn't have needed to hammer, I'd have done it right after she didn't claim at L-1. Parama I had as a town read. Wrong there too.<br>\n<br>\nCecily and TS seem to be the only reads I have had all game that seem to have been right. TS remains to be seen, Cecily, you only have my word on that I thought (as in a [town-thought] not [scum-knew] sense) she was town pre-lynch.<br>\n<br>\nFigured it was wise to give Bub the benefit of the doubt because if I switch it around and let Bub be a townie who just got caught up in the momentum of the Cecily lynch, the rest of the things I pointed out about him don't look near as bad in that light.<br>\n<br>\nWhich brings us to today(game day). After a mental jolt at the beginning, I started over. If you aren't scum Sundy, then I have no suspects. AGar, TS are reading strong town. I have no real case against CP or DH and as I said, Bub gets a pass until he does something blatantly scummy.", "time": "Fri Mar 18, 2011 5:30 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=16537&start=600", "forum": "53", "thread": "16537"}

Alone, scared and praying for a miracle to come along and save them from this nightmare.<br>\nAnd the schools of dead goldfish, and the occasional floating monkey, in this gloomy fishbowl testified just how grim the situation was for them. At least the stench of the rotting corpses served as an occasional distraction.<br>\n<br>\nTime to try for a more blunt approach to get them out of this dire situation, and they were rescued from their impasse of ideas when some Lady GaGa came on. Russian roulette would serve as an awesome finale. As no one had a gun, Bub volunteered a banana he was carrying instead. And with GaGa in a pokadot bikini providing the background atmosphere, they began this game of life and death.<br>\n<br>\nAs the banana spinning came to a stop, one end was pointing at DemonHybrid, the other at AGar. And without having defined which end was the barrel, they began bickering again.<br>\n<br>\nMeanwhile, Bub pulled out his chopsticks and began eating some sushi (cause you know ninjas are like Asian) while having a fantasy watching Lady GaGa who was now wearing something only imagination can describe, oblivious to the fact that AGar and DemonHybrid were ready to kill each other. After he ran out of sushi, he decided to pick his nose and play with his navel a bit to pass the time. And AGar and DemonHybrid were still, eagerly awaiting Bub's input, who was now pre-occupied trying to chase his brown tail, as to who he thought was the ninja monkey.<br>\n<br>\nAGar, unable to cope with the stress declared he was mentally insane, and went and sat in the corner of a round room. DemonHybrid was now convinced that AGar was indeed the ninja monkey. <br>\n<br>\nAfter finally catching his tail, Bub <div style=\"display:inline-flex;text-decoration:line-through\">suddenly</div> finally realized that he now had the perfect opportunity.

Since he's about the worst player I've seen... <br>\nAngry rants from the dead QT:<br>\nRant time:<br>\nKilling the mafia traitor should NEVER happen after Night 1. NEVER.<br>\nWhy?<br>\nYou have a recruit. Did you recruit someone last night? Nope, so you should kill them the next night.<br>\nOf course, all hell could break loose and that person you tried to recruit got lynched the next day, and that's the ONLY case in which a traitor can be killed after N1... but traitors tend to be good at not attracting suspicion early on (see: my play this game &lt;_&lt;).<br>\nTo kill a traitor on Night 3 is a sign that you shouldn't be playing mafia, Bub. You obviously don't know how to.<br>\nAnd yes I have played on a scumteam with a recruitable traitor - same traitor mechanic as this one, in fact. Guess what? We never shot the traitor because we had confirmed non-traitors after Night 1.<br>\nOh thank god. It's NOT OVER but Bub will find a way to screw it up. He might claim scum. I'm pretty sure he's trying to throw the game with the way he's been playing.<br>\nI can't believe how town's trying to twist my DH defense into a buddy-tell. Guess what, Akira LITERALLY CLEARED DH and there's people still lining up to lynch him. I don't really get that AT ALL.<br>\nnooooo<br>\nBub, you need to be online more often. Seriously. STOP HAVING A LIFE.<br>\nOkay, Bub, you obviously don't care about this game. Go die.<br>\nScrew it.<br>\nI hereby proclaim that town should win this game.<br>\nBECAUSE I DON'T WANT BUB TO WIN.<br>\nDH: Hey Bub if you stick around for 10 minutes I'll give you a chance to quickhammer AGar<br>\n*hour and a half later*<br>\nBub: Uh... wtf u talkin' bout nub? vote: parama he's scum<br>\n<br>\n...yeah.<br>\nI nominate myself for only good scum play in the game because everyone used my ISO to mislynch 3 people in a row after I was killed &lt;_&lt;</div></blockquote>\n\nI admit, I totally screwed up the night game. I've never played in a game with a Mafia Traitor before, so I didn't really know how to react to that.
