Role PMs &amp; Mod-Notes <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3246066#p3246066\" class=\"postlink\">here</a></div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">\"EUREKA!\" you hear somebody shrieking in an ecstatic voice from the laboratory next door. \"I'VE DONE IT! IT'S FINISHED! I'VE PROVED IT!\"<br>\n<br>\nYou all rush to the laboratory. There, awaiting you with an exhausted but excited face is Professor Alan Gebra, head of your mathematical research team. Old and decrepid physically, yet in his exhiliration he has taken on a youthful spirit. His white whispy hair quivers with excitement, as he clutches with trembling hands some sheets of A4 lined paper. His shirt and lab coat are soaked with sweat.<br>\n<br>\nHe stares at you all with a glazed over look in his eyes, the feeling of anticipation building in the room. \"THIS IS THE MOMENT WE HAVE BEEN WORKING TOWARDS FOR OVER THREE DECADES!\" he yells hysterically. \"AND I HOLD IT IN MY HANDS, THE PINACCLE OF MY CAREER! THE PROOF TO THE RIEMANN HYPOTHESIS!\"<br>\n<br>\nSome of you break down in tears of joy, others of you rush to smother the professor with hugs. Screams of joy echo through the room. You, the professor's research team, have been through thick and thin with him, ups and downs, and all in a quest to prove a hypothesis. But this isn't just any hypothesis; this is the Riemann Hypothesis, a problem plaguing mathematicians for over 150 years.<br>\n<br>\nBut somewhere in the room there is a pang of regret. Ultimately, you're just the professor's research team. Expendable. Disposable. Irrelevant. Professor Alan Gebra will be the one who scoops the plaudits, while you're left to while the rest of your days away on the Internet (playing Mafia, no doubt).<br>\n<br>\nYet as you all retire to bed, there is an overriding sense of triumph and achievement.<br>\n<br>\nPerhaps foolishly so.<br>\n<br>\nFor as you lie snuggly tucked up in your bed, Professor Gebra tosses and turns in his sleep. His mind is restless; there's something he's forgotten. Mentally he goes over his proof. He's checked it, double-checked it, triple-checked it...<br>\n<br>\nHe sits up in alarm as he hears movement outside his door. </div>His door!<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\"> In his excitement, he didn't lock it! The movement draws nearer. The proof, they're after his proof! As his door swings open and the light from outside floods in, he grabs the proof off his bedside desk and grasps it to his chest like a mother protecting her baby, scrambling as far away from the door as he can within the confines of his room. He squints as a shadowy blob enters the room. One person? Two? Three? More? He can't tell - his glasses are lying on his bedside desk.<br>\n<br>\nLaughter fills the room, and a blur of sounds swim around the professor's ears. \"You won't be needing that proof where you're going, old man.\"<br>\n<br>\nThe shadows envelope him, and as the professor slumps to the floor, lifeless, his grip on his proof, his life's work, is relinquished, and it flutters to the floor peacefully, as if unaware of the atrocities just committed.</div><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Professor Al Gebra, <div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF00\">Vanilla Townie</div>, killed pre-game!</div><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">The next day, there is a hushed awe as you all gather around the bloodied, vacant corpse of the professor. It's only later that one of you thinks to look for the proof - but it's gone. No trace of it remains.<br>\n<br>\nBut who would do such a thing?<br>\n<br>\nYou look around you. Your colleagues all seem to be doing the same thing, and there is a nervous shuffling of feet. <br>\n<br>\nYou see somebody raising their arm towards you, and they're holding a pistol! Suddenly, there's a flash of light, and a loud bang. Your arms fly instinctively to your face and you scream in terror.<br>\n<br>\nYou don't know how long you scream for, but at some point you realise you're still alive. You cautiously lower your arms, and look around you. You're the only one in the room. The pistol and the gunshot... were they </div>imaginary?<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\"> It all looked and sounded so </div>real<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">...<br>\n<br>\nWho can you trust? They could all be killers, conspiring against you! You need to kill them first! ... No, you're just being </div>irrational<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\"> now.

Caps and colons are optional, but it does need to be bolded. The <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: </span> tags are also appropriate for voting.</li>\n\n<ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-alpha\"><li>If it looks like a vote (including broken tags), I will probably count it as a vote (and fix tags if necessary). If you have any doubt, then make a double-post with the fixed tags. Mispellings or shortened names are accepted as long as it is clear who you are voting. If I can't tell who you are attempting to vote, it won't count.</li></ol>\n\n<li>Unvotes are <div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">not</div> necessary before placing a new vote, but appreciated by me. Please bold your unvotes or use the unvote tags. It is not necessary to name the player you are unvoting.</li>\n\n<li>A lynch will occur when a player achieves a majority of votes. When this has happened, any subsequent votes and unvotes will not be counted, and the game will enter twilight. Night will begin as soon as I have declared the lynch. All players alive prior to the hammer (including the player being lynched) may continue to post in the thread until I declare the lynch.</li>\n\n<ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-alpha\"><li>Majority needed for a lynch is calculated as follows: (n/2) + 1 votes [with '(n/2)' rounded down], where <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">n</div> is the <div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">number of players alive</div>.</li>\n\n<li>For example, with 9 players alive it takes (4) + 1 = 5 votes to lynch [as 9/2 is rounded down].<br>\nWith 6 players alive it takes (3) + 1 = 4 votes to lynch.</li></ol>\n\n<li>You may vote for a no lynch if desired. A No Lynch still requires a majority of players to vote for it. Once achieved, the game will progress to night without a lynch.</li>\n\n<li>Once you're dead, you are dead... however, you may make one 'bah' post of <div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">no more than four words</div>.

It both looks genuine and is one third of a wagon on him that could potentially lead to an accidental lynch. If he were scum, he would likely be paranoid about something like this and wind up unvoting shortly after he voted. If he had done so, I wouldn't have a townread on him. On the other hand, if he's town, he would be less afraid since if something like that happens, it would provide the town with good info (i.e. hammering without claim/etc on an RVS wagon would be scummy). <br>\n2; talking about you rather than oopidstay, the way in which you are attacking him is actually looking scummy to me. The last sentence of your second point looks very contrived; it seems like you're voting him because people find selfvoting to be a good way to justify a vote (as is shown by don's last post), not because you think it makes him legitimately scummy.

There was no pressure on me - how could i overreact to anything? <br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>TS wrote:</cite>Yeah, I'm uncomfortable with the implosion sheeping too.

I was lurking like hell that game because I had no idea what I was doing and was busy.

But more importantly... I quoted the post in which I voted you above. How is it, in any way, shape, or form, an overreaction to anything? I moved my vote from an RVS vote to an information-gaining vote as it was more useful there. You seem to be stating that simply voting you in such a way is an overreaction by merit of it being a vote on you, which reads to me as overdefensive. Also, did you think Kalofer was the first vote on your wagon? Why would you think that - there was a fair amount of content between our votes on you.

Before, I'm generally one of those players who write a wall of quotes and text maybe twice a week with some comments interspersed. Apparently a lot of people don't like reading walls  <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\">  So this game I'm going to try to either link or just reference specific parts instead of quoting everything I talk about. If I'm not being clear to what I'm referring to, please feel free to correct me. This is an experiment.<br>\n<br>\nOk so the first major thing seems to be Oopidstay's self-vote. It does strike me as slightly scummy, but I've seen town be rather stupid in the RVS so I'm putting it aside. The reactions are different. Juls' and implosion's reactions strike me as townie, don_johnson seems townie because of his insistence to skip the intense theory debate. I imagine scum would want to linger on an early, rather useless argument early on as long as possible.<br>\n<br>\nTwistedSpoon's reaction does strike me as odd for the same reason that Oopidstay stated. He called it \"contrived,\" I'd call it \"manufactured.\" TS tries to portray himself as a townie by urging scumhunting so early and by referring to \"us.\" <br>\n<br>\nIn post 43, TS aligns himself with Juls, trying to portray them both as town. His post 49 definitely reads like scum explanations or excuses.<br>\n<br>\nNot sure about Juls' suspicion on implosion. I could see implosion as scum if Oopidstay was scum, but only that.

It looked like buddying.  What I am doing here is pointing out a good post by someone.  That's not buddying.   If it had been someone I suspected as scum that posted that I would probably say \"shit...that's good posting, now I have to reconsider my read\".  It's not a strange comment.

It wasn't until after nearly everyone had commented on it (and it was clear what most of the town was thinking) that he actually started posting seriously. <br>\n<br>\nSecondly, his first serious post wasn't that fantastic either. He votes Twistedspoon but <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">completely</div> piggybacks Oopidstay's reasoning. He doesn't even state the reasons and his only justification for the vote is that Oopidstay has a good enough reason to vote for TS. It looks like a bandwagon vote from scum. He also accuses Morthas of sitting back and not doing anything when Kalofer, himself, isn't any better. Finally, his stance on Oopidstay isn't very clear. In the same post he says that it is most likely that Oopidstay was a townie gauging reactions <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">and</div> that the selfvote was WIFOM. Which is it?<br>\n<br>\nThat was all that I had noticed at the time I called him scum, but he's continued acting suspiciously since then. Post 81 looks like he's giving himself room to backpedal and change his stance on TS when he needs to later. The last thing I noticed was that he originally ignored my reasonless suspicions, which is suspicious on its own because it lacks the interest that a townie would have in discerning my allignment. However, my main issue is how he <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">does</div> indicate that he is suspicious of me for the reasonless suspicions once another player (Juls) had done so. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Oopidstay:</div><br>\n<br>\nI suspect him mostly because I don't believe that he actually selfvoted to generate reactions that he could work with. It looks like he might have stolen the reason from implosion and his posting in the first 1.5 pages didn't look like it had serious motivation behind it.

Just look at the questions that I had been asking him prior to the FoS. Also, he had a serious bandwagon at the time, so even if the reasoning wasn't obvious, I had a lot less motivation to withhold it: it would have had hardly any effect on the way scum reacted since there was already suspicion towards TS and they may have already taken a stance on him prior to my FoS. <br>\n<br>\nThe points against Juls weren't OMGUS.

She could have made post 106 and then later changed her mind and realized bussing was the optimal strategy, but her aggressive strategy has shown to be consistent.

I <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">do</div> think that getting himself into that argument with Juls early on is something that might not have happened if he was scum. His play yesterday also seems a lot different from his play in Frogs Mafia 2 where he was scum (however, tbh, I haven't given a thorough read of any of his town games). In addition, the PoE he was using today looked townish as well. My only issue is how he <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">also</div> seems to have flown under the radar today. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Read: <div style=\"display:inline;color:cyan\">Neutral/Town</div></div></fieldset>  <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<fieldset style=\"border:3px outset grey;padding:5px 10px\"><legend style=\"text-transform:uppercase;margin:0 0.6em;padding:0em 0.33em\">Oopidstay</legend>I called Kalofer and Oopidstay scum yesterday, but, at the time, I hadn't been considering or looking for connections. Looking at Kalofer's posts from yesterday, I'm actually starting to doubt Oopidstay is his scumbuddy. <br>\n<br>\nSpecifically, this was the post I looked at:<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Kalofer wrote:</cite>okkkkk...After that exchange I'm leaning town on oopid and juls. It looks most likely to me that Oopid is a townie gauging reactions through what is deemed as obviscum behaviour, juls is a townie responding as expected to that behaviour.<br>\nThe whole subject you're debating about is WIFOM but I'm leaning towards the WIFOM that says oopid is town because I also don't think scum would bother attracting attention to themselves. Implosion I have as null/town because I again doubt that scum would rush to defend someone whether they be town or scum so soon after RVS.<br>\nUNVOTE: <br>\nVOTE: Twistedspoon<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">I think oopid has a good enough reason to vote for you.</div> And what you later said about you bringing us out of RVS better be sarcasm.<br>\nAlso FoS: Morthas, nice job pointing out to TS that we're out of RVS, now how about you actually do something instead of just sitting back? Also, is it me or do your avatars get worse and worse as you change them?<br>\n<br>\n@Don, I don't think it would make a difference, being a random vote but I guess I can't really say so since I've only played town so far.</div></blockquote><br>\nI have a lot of trouble seeing Kalofer blatantly follow their scumbuddy like this (see the bolded portion of the post). In addition, <br>\nKalofer's reasons for thinking Oopidstay are town seem truthful. I also have trouble seeing Oopidstay's vote for DJ coming from scum. My only issue with him is how he seems to have flown under the radar today. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Read: <div style=\"display:inline;color:cyan\">Neutral/Town</div></div></fieldset><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<fieldset style=\"border:3px outset grey;padding:5px 10px\"><legend style=\"text-transform:uppercase;margin:0 0.6em;padding:0em 0.33em\">don_johnson</legend>He was one of my top suspects at the beginning of the day, but his posting today for the most part has looked townish. His scumhunting looks genuine for the same reason why Juls scumhunting looks genuine to me. The only thing that bothers/annoys me at this point is how he is in such a rush to lynch me without letting me post my thoughts. I also don't like how he has ignored my questions.  <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Read: <div style=\"display:inline;color:cyan\">Neutral/Town</div></div></fieldset><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<fieldset style=\"border:3px outset grey;padding:5px 10px\"><legend style=\"text-transform:uppercase;margin:0 0.6em;padding:0em 0.33em\">Morthas</legend>I remember thinking Morthas looked like town yesterday, but that was mostly a gut read. In addition, I think it's more likely that one of the neighbors in this game would be town rather than two scum. I've never seen a game with two scum neighbors from the same group. However, this point is weak if it <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">is</div> actually a possibility. Having said that, Morthas's summary of the QT discussion doesn't look fake. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Read: <div style=\"display:inline;color:cyan\">Neutral/Town</div></div></fieldset> <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<fieldset style=\"border:3px outset grey;padding:5px 10px\"><legend style=\"text-transform:uppercase;margin:0 0.6em;padding:0em 0.33em\">theplague42</legend>On day 1, he expressed suspicion of Twistedspoon and had his vote on him until day 1 ended. However, once the day began today, theplague42 has made no mention of Twistedspoon being scum. Why is that, theplague42? Also, two of his votes today have looked very opportunistic. His vote for Morthas was the L-1 vote and his vote for me two days ago put me at L-2. Having said that, the don_johnson vote looks townish.

There was a lot of straw-grasping in that last post of his.<br>\n<br>\nDebating whether to hold the vote until massclaim is finished...</div></blockquote><br>\nFrankly, based on night actions, this is the kind of situation where I would think I was scum if I didn't know that I'm not. If I look like I'm grasping at straws, that's why. I'm, again, fine with being lynched based on claimed night actions, but I'd like to help with the night action plan before that. I'd like to do that after TS claims for the most part, but I'll assume that he claims vanilla townie. <br>\n<br>\nAnyway, here's my plan:<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Oopidstay should investigate don_johnson tonight.</div> Why? Well, first of all, if he is scum we want to catch him early. He's going to be pivotal in the nightgame. After don, he should investigate juls then morthas. Actually, possibly morthas then juls. If I'm not lynched today, he should investigate me or don tonight. The downside is the possibility of don dying, but I discuss this below. There is a specific reason, which is the fact that don's role could be confirmable. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Claims</div>:<br>\n<br>\nVT - implosion, juls, plague.<br>\nJailkeeper - don<br>\nCop - oopid<br>\nNeighbor - morthas<br>\nwaiting - TS<br>\n<br>\nAfter I'm lynched, don has a few jailing choices. He shouldn't jail morthas or oopid. He should jail a vanilla townie claim, <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">who he announces before the lynch today.</div> We'll assume two mafia. So, at this point there are two obvious possibilities. Either someone will or no one will die at night. This dichotomy is illustrated below:<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">If there is no nightkill</div> - lynch the person that don jailed. Don declares another target and jails them. At this point in the game, the living claims would be (assuming TS VT claim):<br>\n<br>\nJailkeeper, cop, neighbor, 3 VT claims (juls plague TS)<br>\n<br>\nYou'll lynch the VT claim that don jailed. Lets say it's plague for simplicity, and that he declares he'll jail TS:<br>\n<br>\nJailkeeper, cop, neighbor, VT, jailed VT going into night. <br>\n<br>\nAt this point, we again see the dichotomy of there being or not being a kill. IF THERE IS NO KILL, there will be 5 alive and probably a mislynch. That mislynch should be used on the jailed. If they flip town, the living claims will be: VT, jk, cop, neighbor. At this point, the cop should have investigated don and gotten town (if they got mafia, don should be dead by now). At this point, <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">don would jail oopidstay.</div> If don died, the VT would be scum. If oopid died, don would be scum. If the vanilla townie died, don would be scum. If no one dies OR if the neighbor dies, then there's a very simple test to determine scum. Ask oopid if he was roleblocked. If he was roleblocked, this means that don is role confirmed and is likely not a godfather, meaning the innocent on him can be trusted - furthermore, since he was roleblocked, he can't be scum. So if the cop confirms being roleblocked, lynch the VT. If the cop denies it, lynch don, since the cop is clear from having been blocked. That all works if the neighbor died. If no one died, ask the same question. If he agrees that he was blocked, don is essentially clear. Lynch the cop, jail the vanilla townie, lynch the vanilla townie. If the cop denies being blocked, then either don is a gambiting godfather or oopid is scum. At this point, the vanilla townie and the neighbor would have to figure out who's scum between don and oopid. <br>\n <br>\nIf there is a nightkill - treat the person that don jailed as confirmed town. They are unless it's 3 scum. If it is 3 scum and no nightkills, by the way, don and oopid could very well both be scum. A jailkeeper would not make sense in that situation (protection would be useless) and a cop would break the game - unless there's a godfather, which is also possible. <br>\n<br>\nAnyway, back to the plan. If there's a nightkill, it would almost definitely fall on a power role claim. If oopid is nightkilled: you have essentially confirmed innocents in the jailkeep target and the neighbor, which would hopefully be enough to win. If don is nightkilled: oopid would have wasted a night investigation. You still have confirmed innocents in morthas and [jailkeep target], though, which would hopefully be enough. If morthas is nightkilled: don's jailkept VT is clear. If oopid investigated don and got town, you can use the above method of lynching a vanilla townie claim and having don jailkeep oopid to try to role-confirm himself. If don dies, 2 clears out of 3 players. If oopid died, don would be lying scum. So either there would be a counterclaim or town would win. <br>\n<br>\nAt this point, basically, if TS claims VT and the scum isn't in {Oopid, don} we're in VERY good shape. If TS claims a power role, then that gives us even MORE to work with, which would be awesome.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">The above plan in short:</div><br>\nEvery day, don needs to declare who he's going to jail before there is a lynch. Once the game goes down to four players going into night, or possibly even earlier, don can jail oopid to role-confirm himself, since it's unlikely that an individual mafioso would be both a godfather and a roleblocker or jailkeeper. It isn't impossible, but it's relatively unlikely. If oopid denies it, there will be a counter-claim. The downside is that the plan makes several assumptions, including:<br>\n<br>\n-morthas is town. <br>\n-the mafia is not immune to roleblocking or protection.<br>\n<br>\nThe upside is that it doesn't assume that the mafia isn't a godfather. If the above assumptions are true, then the plan has close to sure success if oopid and don are both town. Otherwise, they'll probably wind up as counterclaimants. <br>\n<br>\nThoughts?", "time": "Mon Jun 20, 2011 6:10 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=17666&start=375", "forum": "53", "thread": "17666"}

Lets say we lynch me, jail you, mafia no kill and the town lynches you. that's five people going into night: don, oopid, morthas, twisted, plague. At this point, don jails oopid, actually. If no one dies, you simply ask oopid if he was roleblocked. If he says no, lynch don then oopid. If he says yes, don is cleared and you lynch oopid and don jails between the last VTs (again announcing his result). Lets say that he jails the wrong VT but mafia nokill - then lynch that VT, and don jails the other VT with 3 people going into night. If don dies, oopid would be clear and we'd have a confirmed scum godfather or scum neighbor. If someone else died, oopid would still be clear and you can ask him if he was roleblocked to clear don. <br>\n<br>\nSure, it isn't foolproof, but I think it drastically increases winning odds. Cop+jailkeeper+neighbor sounds fairly balanced, so I'm willing to believe all of the PR claims.

And regardless, Kalofer flipped neighbor.<br>\n<br>\nI get that your argument is that if Morthas was also scum, they would be called masons and not neighbors (at least i think that's what you're saying) but masons are strictly pro-town afaik.

Neighbors are a group of players who can night-talk, and that's the only special thing about that group of players.

Town has a lot of investigative power, and had the Mafia just been Goons (which they essentially are) the setup is pretty stacked against the Mafia. I knew town was powerful, but man, I didn't realise just how powerful they were until we got underway.<br>\n<br>\nHowever, as was alluded to in my review (by the Normal Game Review Group), town needs power due to the... well, for now, let's say 'shock' nature of the setup. To quote Hoopla: <blockquote><div><cite>Hoopla wrote:</cite>You might receive a little criticism post-game from duped townies for the slightly bastard-like element of two scum neighbours. I only say bastard as it's completely unexpected from the way meta is currently. It's a perfectly possible and fine role combination, just unexpected. Which is why I think you need decent amount of confirming town power to narrow the pool of possible scumpartners for town in late game.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nBut, really, I think odds were stacked against the scum-team. Obviously Kalofer dying Day 1 didn't help a great deal, but as it emerged later in the game town had sufficient power to just be able to map out Night Actions and plan for (almost) any outcome. So, alleged bastard-mod shenanigans aside (which I'll get to later) this really is a town-sided setup.</div></div></div><br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: Actual Play</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\">don_johnson played the Jailkeeper very well.

Although, really, the fact that the people he investigated (Twistedspoon, theplague42) were percieved as scummy detracted from their usefulness, because it pretty much was \"Well, cop investigated this guy and he turned up innocent - but this guy is so scummy, he's got to be a Godfather!\"<br>\n<br>\nObviously I'm biased, but I wasn't a fan of how people went \"Yeah, well, Morthas isn't scum because the Mod is wrong when he says Morthas could be scum and if Morthas is scum I will RAGE POST-GAME RAWR\". Given how I'd made it clear Morthas could be scum, the way people promptly ignored that (to make a point about how the setup was bastardly?) was disappointing.<br>\n<br>\nThe worst people were the people who made the above point without then backing it up. Juls, while (incorrectly) ruling out the Mafia Neighbour 2-man Neighbourhood, at least had a reason for doing it (although I think it's wrong as I'll explain later), but there were people who just went \"YEAH IT WOULD TOTALLY BE BASTARDLY\" without any obvious reasoning.</div></div></div><br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: OMG 2 MAFIA NEIGHBOURS YOU BASTAAAAARD /rage</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\">The game was approved by my reviewers for normalcy and balance <div style=\"display:inline-flex;text-decoration:line-through\">so blame them, not me!</div>, and I personally agree with the decision completely (obviously if I thought it was unfairly bastardly I wouldn't have suggested it in the first place).<br>\n<br>\nWhat I just quoted from Hoopla is still applicable in this section so I'll quote it again: <blockquote><div><cite>Hoopla wrote:</cite>You might receive a little criticism post-game from duped townies for the slightly bastard-like element of two scum neighbours. I only say bastard as it's completely unexpected from the way meta is currently. It's a perfectly possible and fine role combination, just unexpected.</div></blockquote><br>\nAnd I wholeheartedly agree with that assessment.<br>\n<br>\nThe main case I could see was Juls'. I'll re-quote it here:<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Juls wrote:</cite>I have talked to the mod about this and plan on addressing it with the normal review committee after but the normal roles explicitly states that <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Scum masons are disallowed</div>.  I know what Hoopla said, and I know what the mod says but I am going to go based on the assumption that scum masons cannot be allowed and therefore Morthas is town.  If it turns out to be different then I will certainly not be a happy camper after the game.</div></blockquote><blockquote><div><cite>Juls wrote:</cite>Calling them neighbors would just be semantics because obviously in a 9 person game you would only have one scum team which basically makes them Scum Masons.  How exactly would they be alignment unconfirmed as both scum?</div></blockquote><br>\nI believe this is a bad interpretation of the Normal Game Guidelines.<br>\n<br>\nI agree more with what implosion said: <blockquote><div><cite>implosion wrote:</cite>Masons are alignment-confirmed neighbors. I see what you mean, but the term mason only applies to pro-town roles. And regardless, Kalofer flipped neighbor.<br>\n<br>\nI get that your argument is that if Morthas was also scum, they would be called masons and not neighbors (at least i think that's what you're saying) but masons are strictly pro-town afaik. Actually, I shouldn't say that since I was in a scum-mason group once, but we didn't know we were scum and it was a theme SO. In normal terms, i'm pretty sure masons have to be town.<br>\n<br>\nThis is kind of no true scotsman, but masons are generally thought of as a group of players who are all town and all know that each other are town. Neighbors are a group of players who can night-talk, and that's the only special thing about that group of players. They could, theoretically, be alignment-confirmed to each other for reasons outside the neighborhood (like having one be a cop and investigate another, or having two neighbors be scum together and just using the \"neighbor\" designation to indicate that they can chat). <br>\n<br>\nIt's still unlikely, but I don't think it's impossible.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nWhy?<br>\n<br>\nWell, 'Scum Masons' is generally used to talk about the case where you have a group of Masons, but one of them is Mafia.<br>\n<br>\nWhich is without a doubt bastardly, as the Masons are under the impression they're all confirmed to be town to each other but they're actually not.<br>\n<br>\nNeighbours, being derived from Masons (who are confirmed to be pro-town) make more sense in that Neighbours are unconfirmed to be pro-town, rather than unconfirmed to be the same alignment.<br>\n<br>\nTaking the stance that the two Mafia Neighbours, who being confirmed in alignment to each other, are actually Mafia Masons, means that I would bet a whole lot of ongoing Normal games are by the same logic bastardly.<br>\n<br>\nBecause, really, under that logic, any scum-group are Mafia Masons and therefore bastardly. They have a QT, they're confirmed in alignment to each other. It would be semantics to argue that because they don't have the 'Neighbour' tagline that they can't be Mafia Masons. Therefore, the only Mafia groups permissible to each other would be when they don't have a QT (and arguably don't know who each other are).<br>\n<br>\nThis is obviously wrong, which is where Juls' logic messes up.<br>\n<br>\nWith the bastardly semantics ruled out, that leaves the possibly bastardly nature of people not expecting 2 Mafia Neigbours in a 2-Man Neighbourhood as a possibility. Which is fair enough, but then I clearly said that it was possible (and you should therefore expect it as a possibility).</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\nOverall, while obviously I don't like being called a bastard<div style=\"font-size: 70%; line-height: normal; display: inline\"><sup>*</sup></div>, I enjoyed modding this and I hope you enjoyed playing, even if you do feel I have been bastardly.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"font-size: 50%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">*okay, maybe a little bit</div>", "time": "Fri Jul 15, 2011 12:33 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=17666&start=675", "forum": "53", "thread": "17666"}
