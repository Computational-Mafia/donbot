Role PMs &amp; Mod-Notes <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3246066#p3246066\" class=\"postlink\">here</a></span><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic\">\"EUREKA!\" you hear somebody shrieking in an ecstatic voice from the laboratory next door. \"I'VE DONE IT! IT'S FINISHED! I'VE PROVED IT!\"<br><br>You all rush to the laboratory. There, awaiting you with an exhausted but excited face is Professor Alan Gebra, head of your mathematical research team. Old and decrepid physically, yet in his exhiliration he has taken on a youthful spirit. His white whispy hair quivers with excitement, as he clutches with trembling hands some sheets of A4 lined paper. His shirt and lab coat are soaked with sweat.<br><br>He stares at you all with a glazed over look in his eyes, the feeling of anticipation building in the room. \"THIS IS THE MOMENT WE HAVE BEEN WORKING TOWARDS FOR OVER THREE DECADES!\" he yells hysterically. \"AND I HOLD IT IN MY HANDS, THE PINACCLE OF MY CAREER! THE PROOF TO THE RIEMANN HYPOTHESIS!\"<br><br>Some of you break down in tears of joy, others of you rush to smother the professor with hugs. Screams of joy echo through the room. You, the professor's research team, have been through thick and thin with him, ups and downs, and all in a quest to prove a hypothesis. But this isn't just any hypothesis; this is the Riemann Hypothesis, a problem plaguing mathematicians for over 150 years.<br><br>But somewhere in the room there is a pang of regret. Ultimately, you're just the professor's research team. Expendable. Disposable. Irrelevant. Professor Alan Gebra will be the one who scoops the plaudits, while you're left to while the rest of your days away on the Internet (playing Mafia, no doubt).<br><br>Yet as you all retire to bed, there is an overriding sense of triumph and achievement.<br><br>Perhaps foolishly so.<br><br>For as you lie snuggly tucked up in your bed, Professor Gebra tosses and turns in his sleep. His mind is restless; there's something he's forgotten. Mentally he goes over his proof. He's checked it, double-checked it, triple-checked it...<br><br>He sits up in alarm as he hears movement outside his door. </span>His door!<span style=\"font-style: italic\"> In his excitement, he didn't lock it! The movement draws nearer. The proof, they're after his proof! As his door swings open and the light from outside floods in, he grabs the proof off his bedside desk and grasps it to his chest like a mother protecting her baby, scrambling as far away from the door as he can within the confines of his room. He squints as a shadowy blob enters the room. One person? Two? Three? More? He can't tell - his glasses are lying on his bedside desk.<br><br>Laughter fills the room, and a blur of sounds swim around the professor's ears. \"You won't be needing that proof where you're going, old man.\"<br><br>The shadows envelope him, and as the professor slumps to the floor, lifeless, his grip on his proof, his life's work, is relinquished, and it flutters to the floor peacefully, as if unaware of the atrocities just committed.</span><br><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Professor Al Gebra, <span style=\"color: #00BF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Vanilla Townie</span></span>, killed pre-game!</span><br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic\">The next day, there is a hushed awe as you all gather around the bloodied, vacant corpse of the professor. It's only later that one of you thinks to look for the proof - but it's gone. No trace of it remains.<br><br>But who would do such a thing?<br><br>You look around you. Your colleagues all seem to be doing the same thing, and there is a nervous shuffling of feet. <br><br>You see somebody raising their arm towards you, and they're holding a pistol! Suddenly, there's a flash of light, and a loud bang. Your arms fly instinctively to your face and you scream in terror.<br><br>You don't know how long you scream for, but at some point you realise you're still alive. You cautiously lower your arms, and look around you. You're the only one in the room. The pistol and the gunshot... were they </span>imaginary?<span style=\"font-style: italic\"> It all looked and sounded so </span>real<span style=\"font-style: italic\">...<br><br>Who can you trust? They could all be killers, conspiring against you! You need to kill them first! ... No, you're just being </span>irrational<span style=\"font-style: italic\"> now. This is a </span>complex<span style=\"font-style: italic\"> issue... But now you're making mathematical puns in your head... and, as the saying goes, that's the first </span>sine<span style=\"font-style: italic\"> of madness.</span><br><br><br><span style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Welcome to Mafiamatical Mathia</span></span><br><br><span style=\"font-size: 120%; line-height: 116%;\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Moderator: Hoppster</span></span><br><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Players</span></span><br><ol style=\"list-style-type: decimal\"><li>theplague42</li><li>Twistedspoon</li><li>Kalofer</li><li>Morthas</li><li>Juls</li><li>implosion</li><li>Wickedestjr</li><li>don_johnson</li><li>Oopidstay</li></ol><br><div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: Alive and Dead</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display: none;\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Alive</span><br><br>Juls, a <span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #00BF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Vanilla Townie</span></span></span>, <span class=\"noboldsig\">survived and won</span> (<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3246029#p3246029\" class=\"postlink\">Endgame</a>)<br>don_johnson, a <span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #00BF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Town Jailkeeper</span></span></span>, <span class=\"noboldsig\">survived and won</span> (<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3246029#p3246029\" class=\"postlink\">Endgame</a>)<br><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Dead</span><br><br>Kalofer, a <span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #FF0000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Mafia Neighbour</span></span></span>, was <span class=\"noboldsig\">lynched Day 1</span> (<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3108433#p3108433\" class=\"postlink\">Lynch Scene</a>)<br>Wickedestjr, a <span style=\"color: #00BF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vanilla Townie</span></span></span>, was <span class=\"noboldsig\">lynched Day 2</span> (<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3137938#p3137938\" class=\"postlink\">Lynch Scene</a>)<br>implosion, a <span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #00BF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Vanilla Townie</span></span></span>, was <span class=\"noboldsig\">lynched Day 3</span> (<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3154595#p3154595\" class=\"postlink\">Lynch Scene</a>)<br>Oopidstay, a <span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #00BF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Town Cop</span></span></span>, was <span class=\"noboldsig\">killed Night 3</span> (<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3162540#p3162540\" class=\"postlink\">Death Scene</a>)<br>theplague42, a <span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #00BF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Vanilla Townie</span></span></span>, was <span class=\"noboldsig\">lynched Day 4</span> (<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3185541#p3185541\" class=\"postlink\">Lynch Scene</a>)<br>Twistedspoon, a <span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #00BF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Vanilla Townie</span></span></span>, was <span class=\"noboldsig\">lynched Day 5</span> (<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3234754#p3234754\" class=\"postlink\">Lynch Scene</a>)<br>Morthas, a <span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #FF0000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Mafia Neighbour</span></span></span>, was <span class=\"noboldsig\">lynched Day 6</span> (<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3246029#p3246029\" class=\"postlink\">Lynch Scene</a>)</div></div></div><br><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Example Vanilla Townie Role PM wrote:</cite>Welcome to Mafiamatical Mathia, <span class=\"noboldsig\">Al Gebra</span>!<br><br>You are a <span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #00BF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Vanilla Townie</span></span></span>.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Powers</span><br>You have no special powers, only your one vote!<br><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Win Condition:</span> <span style=\"font-size: 105%; line-height: 116%;\">You win if all threats to the town are eliminated and at least one town-aligned player is alive.</span></div></blockquote>"}

Use common sense and if you are unsure feel free to ask me via PM.</li><br><li>Be courteous to your fellow player. This is just a game - please don't bring personal grudges into the game.

The <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: </span> tags are also appropriate for voting.</li><br><ol style=\"list-style-type: lower-alpha\"><li>If it looks like a vote (including broken tags), I will probably count it as a vote (and fix tags if necessary). If you have any doubt, then make a double-post with the fixed tags. Mispellings or shortened names are accepted as long as it is clear who you are voting. If I can't tell who you are attempting to vote, it won't count.</li></ol><br><li>Unvotes are <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">not</span> necessary before placing a new vote, but appreciated by me. Please bold your unvotes or use the unvote tags. It is not necessary to name the player you are unvoting.</li><br><li>A lynch will occur when a player achieves a majority of votes. When this has happened, any subsequent votes and unvotes will not be counted, and the game will enter twilight. Night will begin as soon as I have declared the lynch. All players alive prior to the hammer (including the player being lynched) may continue to post in the thread until I declare the lynch.</li><br><ol style=\"list-style-type: lower-alpha\"><li>Majority needed for a lynch is calculated as follows: (n/2) + 1 votes [with '(n/2)' rounded down], where <span style=\"font-style: italic\">n</span> is the <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">number of players alive</span>.</li><br><li>For example, with 9 players alive it takes (4) + 1 = 5 votes to lynch [as 9/2 is rounded down].<br>With 6 players alive it takes (3) + 1 = 4 votes to lynch.</li></ol><br><li>You may vote for a no lynch if desired. A No Lynch still requires a majority of players to vote for it. Once achieved, the game will progress to night without a lynch.</li><br><li>Once you're dead, you are dead... however, you may make one 'bah' post of <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">no more than four words</span>.

I will force-replace players as I feel necessary if I am having to repeatedly prod them. Players may request a prod on another player in the following format: <span class=\"noboldsig\">Mod: Please prod &lt;playername&gt;</span>. This is only to be done if a player has gone without posting for 48 hours and I have missed prodding them.</li><br><ol style=\"list-style-type: lower-alpha\"><li>If you do not post in-thread within 48 hours of a prod I will begin looking for a replacement.

I will be flexible, but if you can't be here for a significant amount of time (as judged by myself at the time) I will have replace you for the sake of the game.</li><br><li>The default deadline for each game day will be 2 weeks.

If this happens, I will let everyone know. (This paticular rule will not be modified.)</li><br><li>Flavour in night/day write up's is just that; flavour. It has no bearing on and does not reflect the setup/roles/actions/choices. As such, speculation on this will be publically mocked.</li><br><li>No cryptography.</li><br><li>Have fun!</li></ol>"}

It both looks genuine and is one third of a wagon on him that could potentially lead to an accidental lynch. If he were scum, he would likely be paranoid about something like this and wind up unvoting shortly after he voted. If he had done so, I wouldn't have a townread on him. On the other hand, if he's town, he would be less afraid since if something like that happens, it would provide the town with good info (i.e. hammering without claim/etc on an RVS wagon would be scummy). <br>2; talking about you rather than oopidstay, the way in which you are attacking him is actually looking scummy to me. The last sentence of your second point looks very contrived; it seems like you're voting him because people find selfvoting to be a good way to justify a vote (as is shown by don's last post), not because you think it makes him legitimately scummy. Especially since you admit that WIFOM is, in the end, involved - and therefore this alone isn't enough to figure out oopid's alignment. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>don_johnson wrote:</cite>is not a fact. please don't phrase it as though it is logic. you're 1 and 2 are probably just as likely(hence, null).</div></blockquote><br>I basically said why I think town is more likely above. And no, there are very rarely facts in the world of mafia. However (as I justified above) oopid's behavior makes more sense as town. I agree that juls has every right to vote him for selfvoting; however, I find it somewhat scummy. It's an easy vote to make. <br><br>inb4 someone posts a picture of a chainsaw"}

I understand the kind of thought process that would lead to a situation like this (to an extent, it'll be cleared up a bit by oopid's answer to don's question). The kind of person that selfvotes as scum generally (probably) wouldn't argue that it's not a bad move as scum, as that would make them look conspicuous and the point of an RVS selfvote as scum is to make yourself look like town (or wifom) while there is still little risk of pressure.

But more importantly... I quoted the post in which I voted you above. How is it, in any way, shape, or form, an overreaction to anything? I moved my vote from an RVS vote to an information-gaining vote as it was more useful there. You seem to be stating that simply voting you in such a way is an overreaction by merit of it being a vote on you, which reads to me as overdefensive. Also, did you think Kalofer was the first vote on your wagon? Why would you think that - there was a fair amount of content between our votes on you. Were you not reading closely?<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Wicked wrote:</cite>@implosion- which allignment do you enjoy the most: town or scum?</div></blockquote><br>Town, by far."}

Before, I'm generally one of those players who write a wall of quotes and text maybe twice a week with some comments interspersed. Apparently a lot of people don't like reading walls  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\">  So this game I'm going to try to either link or just reference specific parts instead of quoting everything I talk about. If I'm not being clear to what I'm referring to, please feel free to correct me. This is an experiment.<br><br>Ok so the first major thing seems to be Oopidstay's self-vote. It does strike me as slightly scummy, but I've seen town be rather stupid in the RVS so I'm putting it aside. The reactions are different. Juls' and implosion's reactions strike me as townie, don_johnson seems townie because of his insistence to skip the intense theory debate. I imagine scum would want to linger on an early, rather useless argument early on as long as possible.<br><br>TwistedSpoon's reaction does strike me as odd for the same reason that Oopidstay stated. He called it \"contrived,\" I'd call it \"manufactured.\" TS tries to portray himself as a townie by urging scumhunting so early and by referring to \"us.\" <br><br>In post 43, TS aligns himself with Juls, trying to portray them both as town. His post 49 definitely reads like scum explanations or excuses.<br><br>Not sure about Juls' suspicion on implosion. I could see implosion as scum if Oopidstay was scum, but only that.

In addition, there's no way I could know for certain that Kalofer and Oopidstay are scum at this stage, so of course I could be wrong.

You have a VOTE on someone with no reason and said someone else is scum and Fos'd another person.  That's 4 people you suspect ON PAGE 5 and the one person you have your vote is one that you don't have any evidence against (that you have presented).  Your post above is a bunch of B.S.  None of the reasons you list says I am scum but I will address all of them nonetheless.<br><br>I.) I have encountered reasonless suspicion from town, sure, but what I dislike here is that you are calling two people scum WITH NO REASON and then FoSing someone else WITH reason.  Now, you have done it again in this post.   I have also seen scum vote one person and express suspicion on the other.  The person who gets the suspicion but not the vote then turns out to be his scumbuddy.<br><br>II.)  See above.<br><br>III.)  What implosion did was take a guy that was getting pressured and start defending him and saying he was town.  If implosion is scum he was taking the opportunity to 1) buddy someone who has pressure and thus win over his confidence in him as town and 2) Get to say \"told you so\" when the flip happens.  It looked like buddying.  What I am doing here is pointing out a good post by someone.  That's not buddying.   If it had been someone I suspected as scum that posted that I would probably say \"shit...that's good posting, now I have to reconsider my read\".  It's not a strange comment.  You can look in 90% of the games on this site and see that comment.  What I see here from you is reaching.<br><br>IV.) I kept my vote on Oopid BECAUSE he hadn't encountered self votes in another game.  It removes the argument that he was doing it for reaction testing (which I still don't buy).  He would only have done that if he had seen that done before.  Otherwise it looked like scum who didn't know that it was bad to self vote. <br><br>I am <span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">VERY HAPPY</span></span> with my vote and encourage others to join in."}

It wasn't until after nearly everyone had commented on it (and it was clear what most of the town was thinking) that he actually started posting seriously. <br><br>Secondly, his first serious post wasn't that fantastic either. He votes Twistedspoon but <span style=\"font-style: italic\">completely</span> piggybacks Oopidstay's reasoning. He doesn't even state the reasons and his only justification for the vote is that Oopidstay has a good enough reason to vote for TS. It looks like a bandwagon vote from scum. He also accuses Morthas of sitting back and not doing anything when Kalofer, himself, isn't any better. Finally, his stance on Oopidstay isn't very clear. In the same post he says that it is most likely that Oopidstay was a townie gauging reactions <span style=\"font-style: italic\">and</span> that the selfvote was WIFOM. Which is it?<br><br>That was all that I had noticed at the time I called him scum, but he's continued acting suspiciously since then. Post 81 looks like he's giving himself room to backpedal and change his stance on TS when he needs to later. The last thing I noticed was that he originally ignored my reasonless suspicions, which is suspicious on its own because it lacks the interest that a townie would have in discerning my allignment. However, my main issue is how he <span style=\"font-style: italic\">does</span> indicate that he is suspicious of me for the reasonless suspicions once another player (Juls) had done so. <br><br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Oopidstay:</span><br><br>I suspect him mostly because I don't believe that he actually selfvoted to generate reactions that he could work with.

If scum was going to vote their partner, I'd expect it to be much closer to the beginning, and <span style=\"font-style: italic\">certainly</span> not the hammer vote. Not when the lynch isn't set in stone."}

His play yesterday also seems a lot different from his play in Frogs Mafia 2 where he was scum (however, tbh, I haven't given a thorough read of any of his town games).

It looks most likely to me that Oopid is a townie gauging reactions through what is deemed as obviscum behaviour, juls is a townie responding as expected to that behaviour.<br>The whole subject you're debating about is WIFOM but I'm leaning towards the WIFOM that says oopid is town because I also don't think scum would bother attracting attention to themselves.

In addition, <br>Kalofer's reasons for thinking Oopidstay are town seem truthful. I also have trouble seeing Oopidstay's vote for DJ coming from scum. My only issue with him is how he seems to have flown under the radar today. <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Read: <span style=\"color: cyan\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Neutral/Town</span></span></span></fieldset><br><br><br><fieldset style=\"border:3px outset grey; padding:5px 10px\"><legend style=\"text-transform:uppercase; margin:0px 0.6em; padding:0em 0.33em\">\"don_johnson\"</legend>He was one of my top suspects at the beginning of the day, but his posting today for the most part has looked townish.

However, this point is weak if it <span style=\"font-style: italic\">is</span> actually a possibility.

However, once the day began today, theplague42 has made no mention of Twistedspoon being scum. Why is that, theplague42? Also, two of his votes today have looked very opportunistic. His vote for Morthas was the L-1 vote and his vote for me two days ago put me at L-2. Having said that, the don_johnson vote looks townish. Not because of the target, but because theplaguescum had no reason to jump off that bandwagon and vote somebody else that had no other votes at the time. <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Read: <span style=\"color: purple\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Neutral/Scum</span></span></span></fieldset><br><br><br><fieldset style=\"border:3px outset grey; padding:5px 10px\"><legend style=\"text-transform:uppercase; margin:0px 0.6em; padding:0em 0.33em\">\"Twistedspoon\"</legend>The first suspicious thing I noticed from Twistedspoon I explained in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=17666&amp;start=75\" class=\"postlink\">post 75</a>. To summarize that post, I didn't like Twistedspoon's defense of his Oopidstay vote. Then, later today, I noticed an interesting inconsistency.

So what am I supposed to do? Should I just giveup and let you lynch me?<br><br>The case against me was originally because I didn't explain my two scumreads. I explained why I did this. Trying to see who agrees with my reads and why without giving out the answers immediately. Trying to see how the suspected players react. Trying to see how other players react. All pro-town motivations. Nothing that harms the town. And I <span style=\"font-style: italic\">did</span> explain those scumreads and I <span style=\"font-style: italic\">did</span> give my own reasoning. Has nobody here ever played with Thesp? He does this a lot as town and he's earned a scummy for his scumhunting ability. It's a good strategy.<br><br>Now don_johnson has said that my vote looked like an early bussing attempt gone wrong. He hasn't explained why, but he <span style=\"font-style: italic\">has</span> insisted that Juls has explained why. But no. Juls hasn't explained this and nobody has. This was the post where Juls said my vote looked like bussing:<br><blockquote><div><cite>Juls wrote:</cite>1) I am not scum<br>2) I didn't like his delay<br>3) I meant what I said, that information is gleaned from Night 1 and I am very happy we got scum regardless of how scummy it made me look.

Vote: Wicked <span class=\"noboldsig\">Wicked was also first on the Kalofer wagon which may have caught him in a bus situation gone awry by my early hammer.</span> <br>5) I like implosion alot more for his reaction to my hammer. He was first to ask why I didn't get a claim. The way I saw it, if Kalofer was a power role he would have been more interested in saving his neck and would have claimed in his \"just a sec\" post instead of saying \"just as sec\".<br><br>I agree the neighbor should claim if there is one.<br><br>Mod: Can you verify that a Neighbor is different than a Neighborizer to you. If he was a neighborizer there is no neighbor, if he was a neighbor then there is a town neighbor out there somewhere.</div></blockquote><br>No explanation given here. How am I supposed to defend? Or should I just giveup? <br><br>It's not looking like I'll be able to save myself today due to some very stubborn townies (hint: Juls and DJ), but if and when I'm lynched the game <span style=\"font-style: italic\">will</span> continue. And all that I ask is that you please don't continue playing this way. Creating a case on someone and then ignoring their defense. Trying to lynch somebody in five RL days.

I honestly don't see myself as having been \"laying low\" in this game - I've explained my opinions and tried to push the plague lynch yesterday (and the twisted wagon on day one). With these claimed night actions (assuming there's no other claims that could explain consecutive nokills) I'm fine with being lynched. With oopid's claim in mind: <br><br>-oopid is more likely scum than before. His selfvote makes less sense as a power role, since as a power role he would probably be concerned about his staying alive and would be less inclined to selfvote. <br>-twisted and plague are obviously both more likely town. Plague godfather is still feasible. I still see TS as town. <br>-don (assuming I'm lynched and flip town) is more likely scum than before. I really don't feel like i would have been killed last night (though it's possible), and I know that me being blocked wasn't the reason for the lack of a kill. I definitely think morthas would have been killed night one. <br><br>I also have a theory in the back of my head that it's 3:6 and scum don't have a nightkill, which would make don pretty much automatic scum and oopid very likely scum.

If I look like I'm grasping at straws, that's why. I'm, again, fine with being lynched based on claimed night actions, but I'd like to help with the night action plan before that.

Well, first of all, if he is scum we want to catch him early. He's going to be pivotal in the nightgame. After don, he should investigate juls then morthas. Actually, possibly morthas then juls. If I'm not lynched today, he should investigate me or don tonight. The downside is the possibility of don dying, but I discuss this below. There is a specific reason, which is the fact that don's role could be confirmable. <br><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Claims</span>:<br><br>VT - implosion, juls, plague.<br>Jailkeeper - don<br>Cop - oopid<br>Neighbor - morthas<br>waiting - TS<br><br>After I'm lynched, don has a few jailing choices.

So, at this point there are two obvious possibilities. Either someone will or no one will die at night. This dichotomy is illustrated below:<br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic\">If there is no nightkill</span> - lynch the person that don jailed. Don declares another target and jails them. At this point in the game, the living claims would be (assuming TS VT claim):<br><br>Jailkeeper, cop, neighbor, 3 VT claims (juls plague TS)<br><br>You'll lynch the VT claim that don jailed. Lets say it's plague for simplicity, and that he declares he'll jail TS:<br><br>Jailkeeper, cop, neighbor, VT, jailed VT going into night. <br><br>At this point, we again see the dichotomy of there being or not being a kill. IF THERE IS NO KILL, there will be 5 alive and probably a mislynch. That mislynch should be used on the jailed. If they flip town, the living claims will be: VT, jk, cop, neighbor. At this point, the cop should have investigated don and gotten town (if they got mafia, don should be dead by now). At this point, <span class=\"noboldsig\">don would jail oopidstay.</span> If don died, the VT would be scum. If oopid died, don would be scum. If the vanilla townie died, don would be scum. If no one dies OR if the neighbor dies, then there's a very simple test to determine scum. Ask oopid if he was roleblocked. If he was roleblocked, this means that don is role confirmed and is likely not a godfather, meaning the innocent on him can be trusted - furthermore, since he was roleblocked, he can't be scum. So if the cop confirms being roleblocked, lynch the VT. If the cop denies it, lynch don, since the cop is clear from having been blocked. That all works if the neighbor died. If no one died, ask the same question. If he agrees that he was blocked, don is essentially clear. Lynch the cop, jail the vanilla townie, lynch the vanilla townie. If the cop denies being blocked, then either don is a gambiting godfather or oopid is scum. At this point, the vanilla townie and the neighbor would have to figure out who's scum between don and oopid. <br> <br>If there is a nightkill - treat the person that don jailed as confirmed town. They are unless it's 3 scum. If it is 3 scum and no nightkills, by the way, don and oopid could very well both be scum. A jailkeeper would not make sense in that situation (protection would be useless) and a cop would break the game - unless there's a godfather, which is also possible. <br><br>Anyway, back to the plan. If there's a nightkill, it would almost definitely fall on a power role claim. If oopid is nightkilled: you have essentially confirmed innocents in the jailkeep target and the neighbor, which would hopefully be enough to win. If don is nightkilled: oopid would have wasted a night investigation. You still have confirmed innocents in morthas and [jailkeep target], though, which would hopefully be enough. If morthas is nightkilled: don's jailkept VT is clear. If oopid investigated don and got town, you can use the above method of lynching a vanilla townie claim and having don jailkeep oopid to try to role-confirm himself. If don dies, 2 clears out of 3 players. If oopid died, don would be lying scum. So either there would be a counterclaim or town would win. <br><br>At this point, basically, if TS claims VT and the scum isn't in {Oopid, don} we're in VERY good shape. If TS claims a power role, then that gives us even MORE to work with, which would be awesome.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">The above plan in short:</span><br>Every day, don needs to declare who he's going to jail before there is a lynch. Once the game goes down to four players going into night, or possibly even earlier, don can jail oopid to role-confirm himself, since it's unlikely that an individual mafioso would be both a godfather and a roleblocker or jailkeeper. It isn't impossible, but it's relatively unlikely. If oopid denies it, there will be a counter-claim. The downside is that the plan makes several assumptions, including:<br><br>-morthas is town. <br>-the mafia is not immune to roleblocking or protection.<br><br>The upside is that it doesn't assume that the mafia isn't a godfather. If the above assumptions are true, then the plan has close to sure success if oopid and don are both town. Otherwise, they'll probably wind up as counterclaimants. <br><br>Thoughts?"}

Lets say we lynch me, jail you, mafia no kill and the town lynches you. that's five people going into night: don, oopid, morthas, twisted, plague. At this point, don jails oopid, actually. If no one dies, you simply ask oopid if he was roleblocked. If he says no, lynch don then oopid. If he says yes, don is cleared and you lynch oopid and don jails between the last VTs (again announcing his result). Lets say that he jails the wrong VT but mafia nokill - then lynch that VT, and don jails the other VT with 3 people going into night. If don dies, oopid would be clear and we'd have a confirmed scum godfather or scum neighbor. If someone else died, oopid would still be clear and you can ask him if he was roleblocked to clear don. <br><br>Sure, it isn't foolproof, but I think it drastically increases winning odds. Cop+jailkeeper+neighbor sounds fairly balanced, so I'm willing to believe all of the PR claims. I also happen to think that plague is godfatherscum, but if he is, the plan would most likely catch him. If don is town, he should think a fair amount about who he jails (but MAKE SURE to announce it publicly) and try to jail scum."}

And regardless, Kalofer flipped neighbor.<br><br>I get that your argument is that if Morthas was also scum, they would be called masons and not neighbors (at least i think that's what you're saying) but masons are strictly pro-town afaik. Actually, I shouldn't say that since I was in a scum-mason group once, but we didn't know we were scum and it was a theme SO. In normal terms, i'm pretty sure masons have to be town.<br><br>This is kind of no true scotsman, but masons are generally thought of as a group of players who are all town and all know that each other are town. Neighbors are a group of players who can night-talk, and that's the only special thing about that group of players. They could, theoretically, be alignment-confirmed to each other for reasons outside the neighborhood (like having one be a cop and investigate another, or having two neighbors be scum together and just using the \"neighbor\" designation to indicate that they can chat). <br><br>It's still unlikely, but I don't think it's impossible."}

When I said this, I was thinking from a neutral point of view (e.g. all of yours). If I'm lynched, it would make don a bit more likely scum to everyone else because it would be odd for me to be nightkilled. However, after further consideration I think that the fact that don is just a generically strong townread combined with balance thoughts makes him very likely town, which would mean i was nightkilled. After thinking about it a bit more, I still find it a little odd but not hugely so. Thinking from a scum's perspective: people had suspicions of twisted and plague, juls and oopid probably didn't look like power roles, and morthas was the neighbor. So don and I would make sense as nightkills, and the scum could have thought i was a power role over don."}

To quote Hoopla: <blockquote><div><cite>Hoopla wrote:</cite>You might receive a little criticism post-game from duped townies for the slightly bastard-like element of two scum neighbours.

Obviously Kalofer dying Day 1 didn't help a great deal, but as it emerged later in the game town had sufficient power to just be able to map out Night Actions and plan for (almost) any outcome. So, alleged bastard-mod shenanigans aside (which I'll get to later) this really is a town-sided setup.</div></div></div><br><div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: Actual Play</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display: none;\">don_johnson played the Jailkeeper very well.

Although, really, the fact that the people he investigated (Twistedspoon, theplague42) were percieved as scummy detracted from their usefulness, because it pretty much was \"Well, cop investigated this guy and he turned up innocent - but this guy is so scummy, he's got to be a Godfather!\"<br><br>Obviously I'm biased, but I wasn't a fan of how people went \"Yeah, well, Morthas isn't scum because the Mod is wrong when he says Morthas could be scum and if Morthas is scum I will RAGE POST-GAME RAWR\". Given how I'd made it clear Morthas could be scum, the way people promptly ignored that (to make a point about how the setup was bastardly?) was disappointing.<br><br>The worst people were the people who made the above point without then backing it up. Juls, while (incorrectly) ruling out the Mafia Neighbour 2-man Neighbourhood, at least had a reason for doing it (although I think it's wrong as I'll explain later), but there were people who just went \"YEAH IT WOULD TOTALLY BE BASTARDLY\" without any obvious reasoning.</div></div></div><br><div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: OMG 2 MAFIA NEIGHBOURS YOU BASTAAAAARD /rage</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display: none;\">The game was approved by my reviewers for normalcy and balance <strike>so blame them, not me!</strike>, and I personally agree with the decision completely (obviously if I thought it was unfairly bastardly I wouldn't have suggested it in the first place).<br><br>What I just quoted from Hoopla is still applicable in this section so I'll quote it again: <blockquote><div><cite>Hoopla wrote:</cite>You might receive a little criticism post-game from duped townies for the slightly bastard-like element of two scum neighbours. I only say bastard as it's completely unexpected from the way meta is currently.

I'll re-quote it here:<br><blockquote><div><cite>Juls wrote:</cite>I have talked to the mod about this and plan on addressing it with the normal review committee after but the normal roles explicitly states that <span class=\"noboldsig\">Scum masons are disallowed</span>.  I know what Hoopla said, and I know what the mod says but I am going to go based on the assumption that scum masons cannot be allowed and therefore Morthas is town.  If it turns out to be different then I will certainly not be a happy camper after the game.</div></blockquote><blockquote><div><cite>Juls wrote:</cite>Calling them neighbors would just be semantics because obviously in a 9 person game you would only have one scum team which basically makes them Scum Masons.  How exactly would they be alignment unconfirmed as both scum?</div></blockquote><br>I believe this is a bad interpretation of the Normal Game Guidelines.<br><br>I agree more with what implosion said: <blockquote><div><cite>implosion wrote:</cite>Masons are alignment-confirmed neighbors. I see what you mean, but the term mason only applies to pro-town roles. And regardless, Kalofer flipped neighbor.<br><br>I get that your argument is that if Morthas was also scum, they would be called masons and not neighbors (at least i think that's what you're saying) but masons are strictly pro-town afaik. Actually, I shouldn't say that since I was in a scum-mason group once, but we didn't know we were scum and it was a theme SO. In normal terms, i'm pretty sure masons have to be town.<br><br>This is kind of no true scotsman, but masons are generally thought of as a group of players who are all town and all know that each other are town. Neighbors are a group of players who can night-talk, and that's the only special thing about that group of players. They could, theoretically, be alignment-confirmed to each other for reasons outside the neighborhood (like having one be a cop and investigate another, or having two neighbors be scum together and just using the \"neighbor\" designation to indicate that they can chat). <br><br>It's still unlikely, but I don't think it's impossible.</div></blockquote><br><br>Why?<br><br>Well, 'Scum Masons' is generally used to talk about the case where you have a group of Masons, but one of them is Mafia.<br><br>Which is without a doubt bastardly, as the Masons are under the impression they're all confirmed to be town to each other but they're actually not.<br><br>Neighbours, being derived from Masons (who are confirmed to be pro-town) make more sense in that Neighbours are unconfirmed to be pro-town, rather than unconfirmed to be the same alignment.<br><br>Taking the stance that the two Mafia Neighbours, who being confirmed in alignment to each other, are actually Mafia Masons, means that I would bet a whole lot of ongoing Normal games are by the same logic bastardly.<br><br>Because, really, under that logic, any scum-group are Mafia Masons and therefore bastardly. They have a QT, they're confirmed in alignment to each other. It would be semantics to argue that because they don't have the 'Neighbour' tagline that they can't be Mafia Masons. Therefore, the only Mafia groups permissible to each other would be when they don't have a QT (and arguably don't know who each other are).<br><br>This is obviously wrong, which is where Juls' logic messes up.<br><br>With the bastardly semantics ruled out, that leaves the possibly bastardly nature of people not expecting 2 Mafia Neigbours in a 2-Man Neighbourhood as a possibility. Which is fair enough, but then I clearly said that it was possible (and you should therefore expect it as a possibility).</div></div></div><br><br>Overall, while obviously I don't like being called a bastard<span style=\"font-size: 70%; line-height: 116%;\"><sup>*</sup></span>, I enjoyed modding this and I hope you enjoyed playing, even if you do feel I have been bastardly.<br><br><span style=\"font-size: 50%; line-height: 116%;\">*okay, maybe a little bit</span>"}

It's tempting to make game decisions based upon that, especially in situations where it seems unlikely a mod would choose such a role combination. <br><br>I can understand Juls' perspective on this, but in the interest of developing and enforcing guidelines in an objective manner (or as close to it as possible), Mafia Neighbours should be a viable role option. The key defining element of a Neighbour is their unconfirmed alignment, so a neighbour flipping scum <span style=\"font-style: italic\">shouldn't</span> confirm the rest of the neighbourhood as town. Meta has slowly evolved to see more roles given to mafia; Mafia Trackers, Watchers, Gunsmiths etc. are all becoming relatively commonplace (for better or for worse) - so, unless it was explicitly outlawed, a Mafia Neighbour pair shouldn't have been seen as impossible, even if the role was somewhat redundant. <br><br>This is the sort of reaction I expect when the first Mafia 1-shot Vig gets used. Although technically a viable role as well, it strongly betrays town's trust in this role's meta, as their whole belief system is calibrated from only seeing town vigilantes before. I'm not sure you can reasonably forbid this role from being given to mafia, much in the same way you can't really forbid two mafia neighbours. The only reason you could forbid something like this, is if you believe it's acceptable to ban a mafia-aligned role if it has never been given to scum before. There had to be a time when Mafia Tracker and Mafia Watcher were first used, and I'm sure the town would have felt equally hard done by in those situations, because it's something they couldn't reasonably expect based on meta.<br><br>Disallowing something because it's never been done before only serves to stifle the evolution of the game. I think if two Mafia Neighbours ever get used again, it will go a long way to causing doubt over the validity of neighbour pairings, much in the same way a Tracker claim doesn't necessarily confirm you as town any more.<br><br>I hope this explains my position a little more - I'm happy to answer questions about this, though."}
