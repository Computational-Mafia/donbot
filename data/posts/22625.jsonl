It overlooks the entirety of the small town- well, hamlet, really- of Condannati, and lends a view into the vineyards that stretch down from the hill upon which the town rests to the valley far below. The town is practically idyllic. There are a smattering of houses, a small police station, a small shop, and, of course, the cathedral itself. It's the kind of town, where everyone knows each other, greets each other as they go about their business of a morning. Each Sunday, nearly the whole population of the city take to the white limestone streets to congregate at the church.<br>\n<br>\nThis Sunday, however, they congregate outside it, around the red smears that mar the white of the paved road, and the corpse of the parish priest. Upon his dead face is an expression not of anger, or of shock, but merely of resignation. A precursory examination from the police confirms that he fell from the spire of the cathedral he loved. What they also turn up, however, is something far more worrying.<br>\n<br>\nA slim stiletto blade protrudes from the frail man's chest, and a single red rose lies upon him.<br>\n<br>\nThe mafia are in town.</div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: Under the shadow of the Cathedral (Survived)</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\"><ul>\n<li><div style=\"display:inline-flex;text-decoration:line-through\">ready2rock</div> <div style=\"display:inline-flex;text-decoration:line-through\">Furcolow</div> Elmo TeH AzN<br>\n</li><li>Scumhunter<br>\n</li><li>Arugula<br>\n</li><li>TheWorst<br>\n</li><li>Bub Bidderskins<br>\n</li><li><div style=\"display:inline-flex;text-decoration:line-through\">SodaSpirit17</div> Luckyjt<br>\n</li><li>McStab</li></ul></div></div></div><br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: Requiescit in Frustra (Died)</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\"><ul>\n<li><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:red\">Tangion, Mafia Goon</div>, was sent out of Condannati  Day 1.</div><br>\n</li><li><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:green\">RXK, Citizen</div>, found gravity a harsh mistress  Night 1.</div><br>\n</li><li><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:red\">Yabbaguy, Mafia Goon</div>, pissed off the wrong guy Day 2.</div><br>\n</li><li><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:green\">Konowa, Citizen</div>, was diabolically defenestrated Night 2</div><br>\n</li><li><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:green\">Axxle, Citizen</div> was speedily dispatched Day 3</div><br>\n</li><li><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:green\">Venmar, Oracle,</div> was punctured Night 3.</div><br>\n</li><li><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:red\">Arugula, Mafia Goon</div> was in the wrong place at the wrong time Day 4</div></li></ul></div></div></div><br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: Slain by unknown forces (Modkilled):</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\"><ul>\n<li>No one.

While town role cop does exist in Mini Normals, it's certainly more commonly a scum role. Another problem is it's impossible to substantiate the alignment; we can substantiate that he's a role cop, but not that he's town.<br>\n<br>\nThere is a way to semi-substantiate it; if the mafia flips some PRs like Roleblocker, Strongman, Ninja etc. then it would make sense to include it. Problem is, the only scum we know who flipped is a vanilla goon. Role cop's are useless to determine vanilla goons. Given the amount of people and the fact that the only mafioso who flipped is a non-PR, I would imagine that we're going up against two more scum, with one PR amongst them (likely a Rolecop or Roleblocker). <br>\n<br>\nI buy Lucky's claim that he's a role cop, simply because it would be suicidal to attempt it without actually being a role cop; but I don't buy that he's pro-town.

This is typical Thomith though, and I know i am town so that is confirmed. Konowa's logic is shaky, but i agree with the incentive that reasoning and logic behind an random vote on page 1 doesn't exactly have to be backed up. That said, the timing of the vote is weird because i can't find any possible incentive to change a vote to Thomith, which doesn't really show much town motivation in my eyes. Voting him over a soda debate? really? Thomith tried to avoid going off-topic, which i don't view indicative of either alignment.

McStabs cautiousness regarding voting Konowa is interesting, since the majority thinks putting Konowa under pressure was a good thing. McStab says Konowa is scummy by saying \" I don't like his behaviour \", but shows no initiative to do anything about. Tangions unvote of Thomith is also scummy because it looks like he is just backtracking. I read his initial vote as a joke vote from RVS because being \"grumpy\" is just a unheard of accusation and I actually laughed. He wasn't being clear with his previous vote on Thomith, and his reasoning for unvoting is bad. Could be just a unvote of a RV, but I saw no reason to unvote that. Compared to Scumhunters vote, his is more bad. Scumhunter unvote to avoid voting for someone he didn't believe was scum, but then returned with a reason rather than sticking with none. He could have just kept his vote and stated a new reason, but i like Scumhunters intentions of not voting for someone with no reason, and i find his actions fairly townie as of the moment. Scumhunter contributes, Tangion doesn't.<br>\n<br>\n- My gut also seems to tell me that Axxle is being scummy. His random focus on a none related discussion ( baseball ) looks like an attempt to look active without really contributing much to the discussion itself. I disagree with his firm stand on the fact Konowa hasn't explain his vote equaling anti-town behavior. Anti-town behavior does not equal scummy behavior, and Axxle seemed convinced that it was the other way around.<br>\n<br>\n- Overall, on page 2 i still have a scum read on Konowa, and scum reads on Tangion and Axxle. I also have a slight town read on Scumhunter. Everyone else is mostly null.", "time": "Thu Jul 19, 2012 4:56 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=22625&start=250", "forum": "53", "thread": "22625"}
{"number": 253, "id": "4197904", "user": "Venmar", "user_id": "18913", "content": "<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Page 3</div><br>\n- Axxle comes off as scummy a bit more on this page. I agree with him that scummy behavior does not always equal scum, as town can make mistakes all the time. But voting for someone means you think they're scum, and Axxle seemed to try and establish a reason to fall back on should the Konowa wagon fail. Saying scummy behavior does not equal scum 100% of the time but voting for someone indicating they think they ARE scum, is bad. <br>\n<br>\n- Moving on to Konowa, his first post is promising ( Post #60 ), but i have some things to point out. He makes a point regarding Tangion, but then he makes a weird stand on Arugula. He makes a statement but doesn't actually really say what he thinks of Arugula, instead he just makes a statement without making himself clear, and this looks like he doesn't have much of a opinion. If this is trying to hint he thinks Arugula is scum, then he isn't making it clear enough, because Arugula doesn't look scummy for what he did. Konowa then tries to justify a TheWorst vote by trying to pin him for trying to pressure Soda into talking. This is a townie move by Soda, but a easy one to fake by scum, so i have no opinion of that but null. His actions against TheWorst is a chainsaw defense for Soda, and a poorly reasoned one in my opinion. Saying someone who is trying to make people talk with pressure is scummy because you think pressuring is an attempt to fake scumhunting, is bad. Pressuring is not scumhunting, and there wasn't much to go on about Soda. Then Thomith sheeps Konowa, and this only makes me look bad because this is a scummy move by Thomith.<br>\n<br>\n- Going on, Konowa then says Soda is scummy for announcing he is pressuring. This isn't scummy, this is stupid. This also proves that TheWorst wasn't trying to scumhunt, but Konowa doesn't take a hint. Thomith then tries to backtrack on Konowa, further looking scummy. *facepalm* Then the rest of the page is people jumping on Thomith for acting scummy, which he was. Axxle also seems to ignore his previous logic of scummy behavior being a possible behavior of a townie and vote hops on to the growing wagon of Thomith. Opportunistic much?<br>\n<br>\nOverall, none of my reads have changed from Page 2.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Page 4</div><br>\n- Not much to note on this page other than the arrival of Soda. Soda seems to come in and do a late RQ answering and throws a vote on Konowa,  but doesn't really say much himself. He brings little to the discussion and seems to say what others have already said themselves. Although, i don't think this is such a scum vibe right now considering what others have said and are doing. This page is also where Tangion just come across as flat out scummy. Don't really need to explain that much.<br>\n<br>\n- I also get a bad vibe from Yabba for dropping in to say something of no relevance, make a joke vote/unvote, and then just leave without making a serious vote or saying anything. Yabba gave me scum vibes right here, as he more of just seems to try and appear more active than he already was. Axxle also looks bad for just jumping on RXK, but it doesn't look like much of a scum move because he was sacrificing his stand on the Thomith wagon. His invalid accusation that RXK never said he was going to be V/LA is also wrong, he mentions of not being around in the post below:<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4168419#p4168419\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4168419#p4168419\" data-post-id=\"4168419\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 40</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=19116\">RXK</a> wrote:</cite><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">unvote</div><br>\n<br>\npujols still sucks.<br>\n<br>\npost coming later when i get back.</div></blockquote><br>\n- Not a big scum vibe, but ignorance and missing of facts is usually a indication of scumminess. ( Axxle )<br>\n<br>\nOverall, Axxle, Konowa, Yabba, and Tangion all look scummy right now.

People see things form a different perspective, and I think Thomith simply saw Soda as a larger chance of being scummy. I don't think your argument holds up Konowa. In a way, someone could view this as Thomith trying to avoid getting involved with Tangion or refusing to vote or lynch his partner, but this is not the case, and why would Thomith try to go against the grain so hard when it was evident that so much of the game was thinking Tangion was scum?

I mean, everyone's getting super bouncy when it comes to getting on wagons D2. <br>\nArugula - Leaning scum - I also think the vote on Tangion is likely to be a bus, it came on late and was for a bad reason, and now he's trying to sheep <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">another</div> wagon (mine) in an effort to blend in.

The case I made earlier isn't sounding right in my own head. I'm still getting this stupid vibe in my head that's saying \"there's something wrong with this guy, it just feels wrong\", but I can't carry on.

I even said \"I will <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">change my mind</div> to Konowa if I get no support\", it's a perfectly obvious play, I've explained it step-by-step why it's valid, and you've still got your head in your ass. Also not sure what to make of sitting firmly on the Tangion wagon despite giving weird sideways glances at Arugula every step of the way.<br>\nSodaSpirit17/Luckyjt - Leaning scum, on one hand it does look like Soda was coaching Tangion and Lucky's first few posts are scummy, but on the other, the slot is a brick (not the completely fucking useless brick from earlier, but...) and it could be an opportunistic lynch. Put one way, I favor the straightforward \"he's scum\" explanation more. ^_^<br>\nMcStab - Unsure. Looked straightforward for one after-V/LA post D1, but is getting super-bouncy on D2 and voting Thomith, then me in rapid succession. His slot's too opaque for me to tell.<br>\nKonowa - Leaning Town, if somehow BOTH the Konowa wagon AND Tangion wagon were scum (top 2 at the end of D1), I'll eat my hat.

Lucky's role is confirmable assuming a scum rolecop couldn't both kill and investigate in the same night.<br>\n<br>\nLet's say Lucky investigates Venmar tonight, Bub watches Lucky, and Venmar targets Lucky. If Venmar dies, Lucky is confirmed town or scum by Venmar's role. If Lucky dies, Bub will catch the scum. If Bub dies, that sucks, but Lucky can confirm Venmar as pro-town, even if it doesn't confirm Lucky. <br>\n<br>\nAssume we lynch one of Arugula, Axxle, TheWorst, Elmo or myself today, and then Bub is presumably killed at night (since Venmar and Lucky are essentially unkillable or at least it's more of a benefit to town if they die than it is benefit to scum), we enter Day Four with Venmar and Scumhunter confirmed town, and Venmar essentially being unkillable conf. town until LyLo. Lucky then becomes a valid target for lynching again, but we'll be able to figure out pretty quickly if he's scum I'd imagine. If scum try to kill Venmar at any point, we get another conf. town or conf. scum. <br>\n<br>\nI think this plan is the best. It gives us a conf. town for the rest of the game either through Venmar or his targets. With seven players left and two of them (Scumhunter and Venmar) as confirmed town, our odds of catching scum go way up. Even if they kill Scumhunter the next night, that leaves Lucky (who quite possibly is a town rolecop) and Venmar alive yet another night, a big risk for any scum. <br>\n<br>\nIn case anyone found this post too long, I essentially propose that we lynch one of the following today:<br>\n<br>\nTheWorst<br>\nArugula<br>\nElmo<br>\nAxxle<br>\nMyself (Don't actually, but I need to be included in the not conf. town category).<br>\n<br>\nIf night comes and we haven't lynched scum, then Venmar targets Lucky, Bub targets Lucky, and Lucky targets Venmar. This plan outs a Venmar scum or confirms him as town, protects Lucky and unfortunately sacrifices Bub. The next day, we have seven players, if Venmar is conf. town along with Scumhunter we then have a pool of the following to lynch from:<br>\n<br>\nLucky + The survivors from today's lynchpool.<br>\n<br>\nVenmar being conf. town then means that if scum try to kill him and he announces his targets out loud we know for sure the alignment of the target. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\nI know that most of your instincts are inclined to lynch Lucky or Venmar, given their previous scumminess and strange role claims. That being said, Venmar's claim is confirmable, and it's potential to create a permanent conf. town player too great to be overlooked. <br>\n<br>\nI will post who out of TheWorst, Arugula, Axxle and Elmo ought to be lynched today in my opinion in a bit.", "time": "Wed Jul 25, 2012 6:08 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=22625&start=425", "forum": "53", "thread": "22625"}

I have a bit of time now, so I'm gonna catch up with [REDACTED] and do a little talking here.<br>\n<br>\nFirst up, the oracle is an experimental role I thought up, and it's one that I reckon could be fun as an open setup with 8 of them plus 4 scum or something. Someone else would need to balance it, I guess. The point is, I felt that the existing post-mortem roles were a tad... superficial, and either ridiculuously overpowered or utterly useless. The meta I was expecting for the oracle was to try as appear as townie as possible, or to fakeclaim doctor or similar, to attract the scum kill. Either way, it seemed to work out well for you.<br>\n<br>\nI reckon that Yabba was if nothing else definitely the most confident scum, and if I'm honest the one I suspected would have survived the game. Bud's near-psychic replication of the scum QTs thought processes were unfortunate for them to say the least. <br>\n<br>\nI had originally intended that the setup would confuse meta more than it actually did. I was hoping that someone- say, the scum- would cry foul when no less than three investigative roles were claimed. Unfortunately, no dice. The choice of essentially useless rolecop was intentional for similar reasons, especially given it's a reasonably frequent scum role. <br>\n<br>\nIf anyone here speaks italian, they may have noted that the name of the game itself was a sort of sideways hint towards the nature of the powerroles. Just something fun I left in.<br>\n<br>\nI think that I could have handled the Furcolow situation better. After his being replaced out, I did recieve a PM insinuating that I've caused him to siteflake. My humblest aologies or my poor work in that regard, but unfortunately I feel that the complaints were legitimate and that they did warrant offering the same for replacements as I did for the original players.
