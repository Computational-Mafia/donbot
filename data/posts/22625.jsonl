It overlooks the entirety of the small town- well, hamlet, really- of Condannati, and lends a view into the vineyards that stretch down from the hill upon which the town rests to the valley far below. The town is practically idyllic. There are a smattering of houses, a small police station, a small shop, and, of course, the cathedral itself. It's the kind of town, where everyone knows each other, greets each other as they go about their business of a morning. Each Sunday, nearly the whole population of the city take to the white limestone streets to congregate at the church.<br><br>This Sunday, however, they congregate outside it, around the red smears that mar the white of the paved road, and the corpse of the parish priest. Upon his dead face is an expression not of anger, or of shock, but merely of resignation. A precursory examination from the police confirms that he fell from the spire of the cathedral he loved. What they also turn up, however, is something far more worrying.<br><br>A slim stiletto blade protrudes from the frail man's chest, and a single red rose lies upon him.<br><br>The mafia are in town.</span><br><br><div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: Under the shadow of the Cathedral (Survived)</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display: none;\"><ul><li><strike>ready2rock</strike> <strike>Furcolow</strike> Elmo TeH AzN</li><li>Scumhunter</li><li>Arugula</li><li>TheWorst</li><li>Bub Bidderskins</li><li><strike>SodaSpirit17</strike> Luckyjt</li><li>McStab</li></ul></div></div></div><br><div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: Requiescit in Frustra (Died)</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display: none;\"><ul><li><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: red\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Tangion, Mafia Goon</span></span>, was sent out of Condannati  Day 1.</span></li><li><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: green\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">RXK, Citizen</span></span>, found gravity a harsh mistress  Night 1.</span></li><li><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: red\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Yabbaguy, Mafia Goon</span></span>, pissed off the wrong guy Day 2.</span></li><li><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: green\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Konowa, Citizen</span></span>, was diabolically defenestrated Night 2</span></li><li><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: green\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Axxle, Citizen</span></span> was speedily dispatched Day 3</span></li><li><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: green\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Venmar, Oracle,</span></span> was punctured Night 3.</span></li><li><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: red\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Arugula, Mafia Goon</span></span> was in the wrong place at the wrong time Day 4</span></li></ul></div></div></div><br><div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: Slain by unknown forces (Modkilled):</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display: none;\"><ul><li>No one.

Nothing has really stood out in his posts, but he has contributed to scumhunting. <br>Bud - Town. He's gone after and remained fixated on scummy behaviour, without jumping onto whatever bandwagon comes along. <br>Furcolow - what the hell. Null leaning town only because I doubt any scum would post something as crazy for a first post<br>Konowa - Null leaning town. His posts have been small, his votes largely unjustified, and his own reactions haven't helped him appear townish, but I get a townvibe from his aggressive demeanor.<br>RXK - Town. His posts have been very rational and critical, and also nitpicky. The nitpicking, in particular, qualifies as a very town trait to me.<br>Scumhunter - Null. Not that much content to go off, but the content he's posted hasn't stunk of scum. He does appear to be being incredibly cautious, which is a potential scum-trait, but from some of his meta I've read he appears to be cautious in general. <br>SodaSpirit - Scummy. Not much content, cautious, and not very critical. At the very least anti-town play.<br>Tangion -Scum. Look at his posts through the eyes of newb scum. It fits perfectly. <br>TheWorst - Town. Content-filled posts, clear views, sound reasoning, consistent.<br>Thomith - Null leaning scum. Could feasibly be scum, but I feel as though the best way to test it is through lynching Tangion. If Tangion flips scum, hang Thomith. If for some reason we lynch Soda instead of Tangion, and Soda flips town, we lynch Thomith. His stances are so simplistic and unfounded on logic, but he seems to hold them strongly, meaning that I think a lynch on either Tangion or Soda (both of whom I consider more scummy) could give us Thomith's alignment.<br>Yabbaguy - Null leaning scum. Not much to go off of, but his attacks on Axxle are ridiculously thin. Overconfidence in a single sentence of a single post?

Generally you don't hammer on someone until they had responded in some sort of way. As a result, discussion stalled.

I'm considering Axxle and Arugula as well, leaving me in a tight spot when it comes to my reads. I believe if I look deeper between the two, I could find scum. I might develop my thought process when I start with a clean slate and not a gigantic WoT above it. Most likely by the time I investigate I'll decide on my vote."}

He seems to sheep a little which to me makes me believe that his votes day 1 were real cases since as I said scum would heavily fortify their votes with reasons each time they voted.

Problem is, the only scum we know who flipped is a vanilla goon. Role cop's are useless to determine vanilla goons. Given the amount of people and the fact that the only mafioso who flipped is a non-PR, I would imagine that we're going up against two more scum, with one PR amongst them (likely a Rolecop or Roleblocker). <br><br>I buy Lucky's claim that he's a role cop, simply because it would be suicidal to attempt it without actually being a role cop; but I don't buy that he's pro-town.

This is typical Thomith though, and I know i am town so that is confirmed. Konowa's logic is shaky, but i agree with the incentive that reasoning and logic behind an random vote on page 1 doesn't exactly have to be backed up. That said, the timing of the vote is weird because i can't find any possible incentive to change a vote to Thomith, which doesn't really show much town motivation in my eyes. Voting him over a soda debate? really? Thomith tried to avoid going off-topic, which i don't view indicative of either alignment. Overreaction to Bubs RV is also shaky, I read Bubs post as not serious, so i didn't really see why the reaction was necessary by Konowa.<br><br>Overall, on Page 1 I have a slight scum read on Konowa, and null on almost everyone else.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Answers to RQS:</span><br>1.

McStabs cautiousness regarding voting Konowa is interesting, since the majority thinks putting Konowa under pressure was a good thing. McStab says Konowa is scummy by saying \" I don't like his behaviour \", but shows no initiative to do anything about. Tangions unvote of Thomith is also scummy because it looks like he is just backtracking. I read his initial vote as a joke vote from RVS because being \"grumpy\" is just a unheard of accusation and I actually laughed. He wasn't being clear with his previous vote on Thomith, and his reasoning for unvoting is bad. Could be just a unvote of a RV, but I saw no reason to unvote that. Compared to Scumhunters vote, his is more bad. Scumhunter unvote to avoid voting for someone he didn't believe was scum, but then returned with a reason rather than sticking with none. He could have just kept his vote and stated a new reason, but i like Scumhunters intentions of not voting for someone with no reason, and i find his actions fairly townie as of the moment. Scumhunter contributes, Tangion doesn't.<br><br>- My gut also seems to tell me that Axxle is being scummy. His random focus on a none related discussion ( baseball ) looks like an attempt to look active without really contributing much to the discussion itself. I disagree with his firm stand on the fact Konowa hasn't explain his vote equaling anti-town behavior. Anti-town behavior does not equal scummy behavior, and Axxle seemed convinced that it was the other way around.<br><br>- Overall, on page 2 i still have a scum read on Konowa, and scum reads on Tangion and Axxle. I also have a slight town read on Scumhunter. Everyone else is mostly null."}

I agree with him that scummy behavior does not always equal scum, as town can make mistakes all the time. But voting for someone means you think they're scum, and Axxle seemed to try and establish a reason to fall back on should the Konowa wagon fail. Saying scummy behavior does not equal scum 100% of the time but voting for someone indicating they think they ARE scum, is bad. <br><br>- Moving on to Konowa, his first post is promising ( Post #60 ), but i have some things to point out. He makes a point regarding Tangion, but then he makes a weird stand on Arugula. He makes a statement but doesn't actually really say what he thinks of Arugula, instead he just makes a statement without making himself clear, and this looks like he doesn't have much of a opinion. If this is trying to hint he thinks Arugula is scum, then he isn't making it clear enough, because Arugula doesn't look scummy for what he did. Konowa then tries to justify a TheWorst vote by trying to pin him for trying to pressure Soda into talking. This is a townie move by Soda, but a easy one to fake by scum, so i have no opinion of that but null. His actions against TheWorst is a chainsaw defense for Soda, and a poorly reasoned one in my opinion. Saying someone who is trying to make people talk with pressure is scummy because you think pressuring is an attempt to fake scumhunting, is bad. Pressuring is not scumhunting, and there wasn't much to go on about Soda. Then Thomith sheeps Konowa, and this only makes me look bad because this is a scummy move by Thomith.<br><br>- Going on, Konowa then says Soda is scummy for announcing he is pressuring. This isn't scummy, this is stupid. This also proves that TheWorst wasn't trying to scumhunt, but Konowa doesn't take a hint. Thomith then tries to backtrack on Konowa, further looking scummy. *facepalm* Then the rest of the page is people jumping on Thomith for acting scummy, which he was. Axxle also seems to ignore his previous logic of scummy behavior being a possible behavior of a townie and vote hops on to the growing wagon of Thomith. Opportunistic much?<br><br>Overall, none of my reads have changed from Page 2.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Page 4</span><br>- Not much to note on this page other than the arrival of Soda. Soda seems to come in and do a late RQ answering and throws a vote on Konowa,  but doesn't really say much himself. He brings little to the discussion and seems to say what others have already said themselves. Although, i don't think this is such a scum vibe right now considering what others have said and are doing. This page is also where Tangion just come across as flat out scummy. Don't really need to explain that much.<br><br>- I also get a bad vibe from Yabba for dropping in to say something of no relevance, make a joke vote/unvote, and then just leave without making a serious vote or saying anything. Yabba gave me scum vibes right here, as he more of just seems to try and appear more active than he already was. Axxle also looks bad for just jumping on RXK, but it doesn't look like much of a scum move because he was sacrificing his stand on the Thomith wagon. His invalid accusation that RXK never said he was going to be V/LA is also wrong, he mentions of not being around in the post below:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4168419#p4168419\" class=\"postlink\">post 40</a>, RXK wrote:</cite><span class=\"noboldsig\">unvote</span><br><br>pujols still sucks.<br><br>post coming later when i get back.</div></blockquote><br>- Not a big scum vibe, but ignorance and missing of facts is usually a indication of scumminess. ( Axxle )<br><br>Overall, Axxle, Konowa, Yabba, and Tangion all look scummy right now. I am losing my town vibe on Scumhunter a bit because of his waning presence in the game, as he hasn't posted in a while. Soda is still null, as well as everyone else."}

Couldn't tell from this game, so I looked at his meta and he was using a lot of weasel words when he was scum in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?t=22015&amp;f=51&amp;st=0&amp;sk=t&amp;sd=a&amp;user_select=15112&amp;user_select2=0&amp;user_select3=0&amp;user_sort=Go\" class=\"postlink\">Open 402</a>. Here he looks more sure of himself. <br>Scumhunter - Town. Liking how he's trying to not be opportunistic, whereas most others are getting really bouncy with their votes, especially today. I mean, everyone's getting super bouncy when it comes to getting on wagons D2. <br>Arugula - Leaning scum - I also think the vote on Tangion is likely to be a bus, it came on late and was for a bad reason, and now he's trying to sheep <span style=\"font-style: italic\">another</span> wagon (mine) in an effort to blend in. Posting style seems off as well.<br>TheWorst - Town. If there's ever such a thing as playing a cookie-cutter scumhunting game, I'm thinking that would be it.<br>Axxle - Don't know. The case I made earlier isn't sounding right in my own head. I'm still getting this stupid vibe in my head that's saying \"there's something wrong with this guy, it just feels wrong\", but I can't carry on. Maybe Axxle just needs to post better, like posting longer or being more transparent in his thoughts somehow. That would help.<br>Bub Bidderskins - Leaning Town, but is now <span style=\"font-style: italic\">lying</span> about the fact that my case is still valid. I even said \"I will <span style=\"font-style: italic\">change my mind</span> to Konowa if I get no support\", it's a perfectly obvious play, I've explained it step-by-step why it's valid, and you've still got your head in your ass. Also not sure what to make of sitting firmly on the Tangion wagon despite giving weird sideways glances at Arugula every step of the way.<br>SodaSpirit17/Luckyjt - Leaning scum, on one hand it does look like Soda was coaching Tangion and Lucky's first few posts are scummy, but on the other, the slot is a brick (not the completely fucking useless brick from earlier, but...) and it could be an opportunistic lynch. Put one way, I favor the straightforward \"he's scum\" explanation more. ^_^<br>McStab - Unsure. Looked straightforward for one after-V/LA post D1, but is getting super-bouncy on D2 and voting Thomith, then me in rapid succession. His slot's too opaque for me to tell.<br>Konowa - Leaning Town, if somehow BOTH the Konowa wagon AND Tangion wagon were scum (top 2 at the end of D1), I'll eat my hat. Maybe I could be overvaluing that assessment, but I'm definitely more confident he's innocent now.<br><br>---<br><br>No vote, just a few questions:<br><br>@Furcolow: I'm sorry I called you a fucking useless brick... okay, not really. How the flying fuck are we meant to tell the difference between you being scum and Town?<br>@Arugula: \"not defending oneself is scummy\"... why?<br>@McStab: Why is my play scummy?<br>@Bub: You voted Tangion-scum first, but you kept giving sideways glances at Arugula every step of the way, even saying you didn't want the Day to end, yet you kept your vote to end the Day.

Lucky's role is confirmable assuming a scum rolecop couldn't both kill and investigate in the same night.<br><br>Let's say Lucky investigates Venmar tonight, Bub watches Lucky, and Venmar targets Lucky. If Venmar dies, Lucky is confirmed town or scum by Venmar's role. If Lucky dies, Bub will catch the scum. If Bub dies, that sucks, but Lucky can confirm Venmar as pro-town, even if it doesn't confirm Lucky. <br><br>Assume we lynch one of Arugula, Axxle, TheWorst, Elmo or myself today, and then Bub is presumably killed at night (since Venmar and Lucky are essentially unkillable or at least it's more of a benefit to town if they die than it is benefit to scum), we enter Day Four with Venmar and Scumhunter confirmed town, and Venmar essentially being unkillable conf. town until LyLo. Lucky then becomes a valid target for lynching again, but we'll be able to figure out pretty quickly if he's scum I'd imagine. If scum try to kill Venmar at any point, we get another conf. town or conf. scum. <br><br>I think this plan is the best. It gives us a conf. town for the rest of the game either through Venmar or his targets. With seven players left and two of them (Scumhunter and Venmar) as confirmed town, our odds of catching scum go way up. Even if they kill Scumhunter the next night, that leaves Lucky (who quite possibly is a town rolecop) and Venmar alive yet another night, a big risk for any scum. <br><br>In case anyone found this post too long, I essentially propose that we lynch one of the following today:<br><br>TheWorst<br>Arugula<br>Elmo<br>Axxle<br>Myself (Don't actually, but I need to be included in the not conf. town category).<br><br>If night comes and we haven't lynched scum, then Venmar targets Lucky, Bub targets Lucky, and Lucky targets Venmar. This plan outs a Venmar scum or confirms him as town, protects Lucky and unfortunately sacrifices Bub. The next day, we have seven players, if Venmar is conf. town along with Scumhunter we then have a pool of the following to lynch from:<br><br>Lucky + The survivors from today's lynchpool.<br><br>Venmar being conf. town then means that if scum try to kill him and he announces his targets out loud we know for sure the alignment of the target. <br><br><br>I know that most of your instincts are inclined to lynch Lucky or Venmar, given their previous scumminess and strange role claims. That being said, Venmar's claim is confirmable, and it's potential to create a permanent conf. town player too great to be overlooked. <br><br>I will post who out of TheWorst, Arugula, Axxle and Elmo ought to be lynched today in my opinion in a bit."}

I think he's flailing scum trying to break the setup by convincing us to lynch Bub.<br><br>Actually, Elmo needs to die today or tomorrow. Anyone who disagrees with the way we've broken the game isn't pursuing a pro-town agenda, and that's what Elmo is doing.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: Arugula</span><br><br><br>If I die tonight for some reason, make sure we continue to use Lucky to make conf. townies and Bub protects Lucky. If Bub is scum we can wait till LyLo when we should be amongst a bunch of conf. townies, and Bub can get lynched then. I doubt he is though. Lucky, make sure you investigate one of me Elmo or TheWorst tonight, and Bub, protect Lucky."}

It's fine though!<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Venmar:</span> With the help of Bud, you got out of a tough spot and turned yourself into clear.

Props to you for squeezing out of there.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">yabbaguy:</span> Holy shit what can I say? If you got passed Bud you would've destroyed us. And I had that feeling too, I thought you were very good mafia who would destroy town. If it were not for Bud, I think mafia might've won. Your analysis was spot on in the night for the most part, I'm impressed. Keep up the good work.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Tangion:</span> I think you need to respond to the pressure as mafia, and defend yourself.

I have a bit of time now, so I'm gonna catch up with [REDACTED] and do a little talking here.<br><br>First up, the oracle is an experimental role I thought up, and it's one that I reckon could be fun as an open setup with 8 of them plus 4 scum or something. Someone else would need to balance it, I guess. The point is, I felt that the existing post-mortem roles were a tad... superficial, and either ridiculuously overpowered or utterly useless. The meta I was expecting for the oracle was to try as appear as townie as possible, or to fakeclaim doctor or similar, to attract the scum kill. Either way, it seemed to work out well for you.<br><br>I reckon that Yabba was if nothing else definitely the most confident scum, and if I'm honest the one I suspected would have survived the game. Bud's near-psychic replication of the scum QTs thought processes were unfortunate for them to say the least. <br><br>I had originally intended that the setup would confuse meta more than it actually did. I was hoping that someone- say, the scum- would cry foul when no less than three investigative roles were claimed. Unfortunately, no dice. The choice of essentially useless rolecop was intentional for similar reasons, especially given it's a reasonably frequent scum role. <br><br>If anyone here speaks italian, they may have noted that the name of the game itself was a sort of sideways hint towards the nature of the powerroles. Just something fun I left in.<br><br>I think that I could have handled the Furcolow situation better. After his being replaced out, I did recieve a PM insinuating that I've caused him to siteflake. My humblest aologies or my poor work in that regard, but unfortunately I feel that the complaints were legitimate and that they did warrant offering the same for replacements as I did for the original players.
