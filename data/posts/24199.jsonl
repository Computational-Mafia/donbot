He wandered its re-arranged aisles anyway, itching at his new (and excellent) haircut. In the week he'd been out, his clothing had begun to fit him better, which in its way had lessened the sense of foreboding he'd felt on his arrival back in town. Why, then, the lingering dread as he considered the picked-over Bestseller shelves, the pine tables with their CLEARANCE stickers, the supple thuk-thuk-thuk of the twin escalators (he remembered those well). Where once had sat four rows of Fiction and Literature now were bright pyramids of puzzles, board games, Lego; on the far side, near the bank of floor-to-ceiling windows, empty faded carpet criss-crossed by dark impressions where shelves had once sat. <br><br>Things he didn't know: 1. The name of the man he was here to meet; 2. The exact reason(s) (though here he had a pretty good idea); 3. What it was, exactly, he planned to do if that pretty good idea turned out to be the gospel truth. He was unarmed; no one knew he was here. A lot had to have changed since he'd gone down those twenty years before, but he knew all too well the trouble with assumptions, the flaw inherent in trust. Yet here he was. Alone. Free. And possibly, he knew, a liability. <br><br>And\u2026 then he died somehow. The Mafia did it. You all thought the Mafia was gone.

Voting:</span> Votes and unvotes must be in bold to be counted. (Ex: <span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: Dunhamganger</span>.) You do not have to unvote between votes for the next vote to be counted. You may <span class=\"noboldsig\">unvote</span> at any time and need not specify who you were voting for.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"> 2.Lynching</span>: Lynches require a simple majority of votes. Once that majority is reached, a lynch is achieved and further votes or unvotes will have no effect. <br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">3. No Lynch</span>: You may <span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: No lynch</span> if you wish to end the day without lynching (herp). No Lynch will also require a simple majority.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">4. Deadline</span>: This game will function on a cycle of strict 3-week days. Replacements near deadline will extend that deadline by a maximum of 3 days. <br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">5. Deadline Lynch</span>: When the deadline passes, if no player has a majority of the votes, the player with the most votes will be lynched. If more than one player is tied for the most votes, no lynch will occur<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">6. Night and Night Actions</span>: Night will last for 72 hours maximum. Night actions not received within those 72 hours will not occur. Night actions will be resolved using Natural Action Resolution. <br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">7. Lurking</span>: Players who sign up in this game are expected to actively post and participate. Players who do not post for 72 hours without prior warning will be prodded. Failure to respond to a prod within 48 hours will result in replacement. Lurking will not be a viable strategy in this game and players who are consistently prodded or post only to avoid being prodded will be replaced at the Mod's discretion. <br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">8. Out-Of-Thread/Beyond-The-Grave Communication</span>: The game is not to be discussed outside the thread unless your role specifically states that you may do so, and then only in the manner stated in your role PM. Don't quote any out-of-thread communications regarding this game in the thread; this includes your role PM. In addition, once you're dead, you may post exactly once more (often called a \"Bah\" post) before endgame, and it may not contain relevant game content. Any violation of this rule is a modkillable offense. <br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">9. Posting Style</span>: Do not use odd colors, font size, or excessive images in your posts. Do not be unduly abusive to your fellow players. Do not edit or delete your previous posts. No codes or foreign languages. Failure to meet these criteria will result in warnings and/or replacement.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">10. V/LA</span>: If you are going to be V/LA, please post in the thread if at all possible. Do not assume that a simple site-wide announcement will suffice. Please treat this game like a commitment and respect the time and enjoyment of your fellow players.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">11. Questions, Comments, Concerns</span>: If you have any questions that need to be addressed outside of the thread, please PM me. Otherwise, you may get my attention using either of the following formats: <span class=\"noboldsig\">@Dunhamganger</span>, <span class=\"noboldsig\">@Mod</span>.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">12. Playing to Win</span>: If at any point I deem you to be playing against your win condition, you will be modkilled. No exceptions. <br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">13. Catch-All</span>: If you seem to be violating the spirit of these rules while operating under the letter of them, I will take appropriate action. Fair warning.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">14. Fun</span>: Having fun is by no means mandatory, but I would vastly prefer that each of you have some amount of it. If there's anything I can do to ensure that you do, please do not hesitate to let me know.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">15. Modkills</span>: A modkill will result in the day ending as if a lynch had occurred. Cool.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Sample Role PM:</span><br><br>This is a closed set-up. At least one player has the following role:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Dunhamganger wrote:</cite>Welcome to Bubble Tape Mafia, _________. You are a <span class=\"noboldsig\">Vanilla Townie</span>. You may post and vote during the day. You may do nothing at night. <br><br>You win when all threats to the town have been eliminated. </div></blockquote><br><br>(But, I mean. It says their name.)"}

Using meta checks is a REALLY easy way to look like you are doing something.  Both town and scum do it and its not really a tell.

It appears you did not do so.<br><br>Since you continuously change your vote, you might be trying to investigate everyone systematically like I am. That would be good. Or it might indicate you don't know who scums are. That is good, you would be town then. Or you could be faking it, pretending to not know who scums are. That would be bad. So really I don't know what to think about you for sure.<br><br>I will read back through and try and get a feel for Thor and interactions with you and others. Right now I've not had time to concentrate on it. There are approx 20 days left of Day 1, and I'm sure it can wait a few RL days. But as I said, many things are far more convoluted than I am used to, including Thor-AP interactions; I'm more used to drawing straightforward deductions from plain facts, rather than several layers of WIFOM reasoning. But maybe I will be able to draw a definite conclusion."}

It was my first post and out of everything I saw on page one that was what leapt out at me as suspicious  because to me its confusing why someone would post like that.

What does role-playing a commercial achieve?<br>-AngryPidgeon/Thor665: their discussions with each other, one of them may be right. can they both be right/wrong? Can't really get any definite town or scum reads from either but arguing over 2-3 pages this early on, I think one at least will be definite town.<br>-zipperflesh: why was he sheeping thor in the first place and now defending/agreeing with him in the same arguments?  Is there a meta-clique here or is it a game strategy? It doesn't seem smart for maf to band together so obviously so early on but then everyone seems to be very experienced so is it a case of wifom?<br>-dave168/d3x: both are asking a lot of questions which makes the appear very pro-town. which could mean they're trying to appear town because their scum and information works both ways too."}

So I posted twice more because I was upset of not playing well to my win condition, of looking like I'd given a vague answer, an answer that if I hadn't posted to clarify would probably be twisted by a scum.

Obviously you aren't going to agree with the case on you, but d3x made a solid case on Cyber in p244 that you haven't mentioned your thoughts on.  I read this as you saying you'd prefer a PL at this time over any players actively posting.  I don't understand the 'lurkers are scummier than cases on active players' mentality you have.

Since he isn't experienced he wouldn't know that RVS wagons are common on MS. Not knowing this informagtion, they are often more likely to try and justify their vote so they can point back to it later and say \"SEE, I had a good reason for it\" and he can point to these votes to try and paint them as scum. <br><br>You can see he believes this based on this little number from post 313. <br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Also, if someone joins a wagon, surely its better that they have any reason (reliable or otherwise) rather than sheeping someone else? </div></blockquote><br><br>But wait there is more.<br><br>His very first game on site he was told to go to the wiki and learn about RVS so unless he chose to ignore this request (unlikely since he was town and he was brand new to the site) or he forgot somehow (possible but unlikely) SO why would he try and paint an RVS vote as scummy?<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>@MM: I have to start somewhere. Its better than wasting time on \"all your base belong to me\". What are you doing that's scum hunting? Nothing.

Why does he not mention Thor who was also guilty of placing the 2nd vote on someone? Why does he not mention DoubleJD who he is voting for right now."}

If you're so sure I'm scum why not lynch me later in the game in the absence of evidence I am innocent?

You are clearly predisposed to read me as Scum {mastermind, no less}.  I'd say that I'm fighting against easy policy lynches, building cases that are not being trn down/refuted {just not gaining the steam that I'd obv like}, and while I'm rusty as hell, Scum hunting.  I think you'll find that probably my most striking Scum meta is that I tend to tunnel and while you can argue that as I know this, it's not a sound tell; the point stands.  Anyone is free to check my completed games, they're all linked in my wiki.  Back in the day, I was rather active and have completed quite a number of Scum and Town games.

As vocal as he is about how he doesn't like how this site functions/is run, he didn't mention it at all.  Even if he did, Scumkush would've been mad that he got caught on the MisLynch Wagon if he was trying to jump off before it reached it's obvTerminal destination.

I think it's because DoubleJD was one of our inactives.  He was more prolific than the other 2, but he still wasn't here.  It's a pretty safe kill.  You can read into this that one or both of the other two are Scum and that's why they didn't bite it, or that it was random.  I think enough of us had blood on our hands D1 that it'd be a safe bet that we would all be pretty much at each others throats today.  If the Scum didn't have a solid read on the other players who {if anyone} was a PR, they could've also just been fishing.  Enough WIFOM NK spec.  You made me feel dirty mastin, I need a shower.

I will build my cases for them.  I will also add to the discussion on others' play that I think is scummy.

I will gauge how likely I find it to be legit and support it if necessary.<br>3- Opportunistic- You forgot MM, lol.  I believe them to be scummy.  They are more than welcome to come in here and refute my points.  Until said time, I don't see how my stance can change on their play.  Besides, do you think it would be harmful to the town if they came in here and played?  Are you so sure that they are not Scum?  Can you say that with 100% certainty?  Because if not, they need to get tehir asses in here and play the game.  Lurking should never be a viable strat and should be frowned upon.<br>4- Discrediting Othes- If I don't believe their points to be valid... uh, yeah.  I'ma gonna discredit them.  If you say the sky is lavendar and try to pass that off as truth, I will tell you you are wrong.<br>5- Acive Lurking- I find this the most difficult to swallow, honestly.  I believe I'm adding well to the discussion and bringing up valid points.  Others seem to agree with me.  Being a stay-at-home dad of a 3mon old, I don't have a ridonk amount of time to be on here.

He has no reason to assume that when mafia-AP is MORE likely from his perspective if he really is town.  There is no reason why SK couldnt have killed DoubleJD and the mafia team (me) tried to target Jake.  But he assumes the reverse FOR NO REASON WHATSOEVER.  In fact, Jake HAS to be an SK and not just mafia here.  If Jake is mafia, he has to be a BP goon.

This is occam's razor.  I will fucking murder anyone that calls WIFOM on this.<br>Also it makes perfect sense for an SK in his situation.

He knows mafia targeted him last night (or very strongly suspects it, given the lack of NK other than his) and he sees my vote as a sign that I know he is scum all of a sudden based on the lack of a mafia NK.  He then preemptively jumps the gun and accuses me of being scum for 'slipping' about targeting him.  Jake firmly believes I am mafia and is trying to 1v1 me for that reason.  Why did he call me an SK then?  He has no reason to make that assumption as town.

He has no reason to assume that when mafia-AP is MORE likely from his perspective if he really is town.  There is no reason why SK couldnt have killed DoubleJD and the mafia team (me) tried to target Jake.  But he assumes the reverse FOR NO REASON WHATSOEVER.  In fact, Jake HAS to be an SK and not just mafia here.  If Jake is mafia, he has to be a BP goon.  He has no reason to believe I am an SK (there was only one kill last night) unless his team shot someone BP who would then be the SK.  (And that isnt me).  <span class=\"noboldsig\">THEREFORE Jake HAS to be the SK.</span><br><br>2. Jake preemptively defends/OMGUS's from my opening post.  Why is he so overly defensive for absolutely no reason?  Because he KNOWS that he was shot at.

He killed DoubleJD.</span>  The mafia tried to kill Jake which brings me to point 3.<br><br>3.

This is occam's razor.  I will fucking murder anyone that calls WIFOM on this.<br>Also it makes perfect sense for an SK in his situation.

Me being a vig target makes sense. <br><br>If I jumped the gun and you are a VT than your play and your 180 on me makes no sense.

We can come back to him another time.<br><br>2. Cybertronix<br>^Cyber's posting started out weak, but it's gotten stronger and stronger as the game has progressed. He's been raising good points and has shown a clear town train of thought. His stances have been strong, and his posts have been transparent. Add to that, he has a town tone to his posts; his way of negotiating with others feels incredibly natural.<br><br>3. mastin2 (replacing Leonshade)<br>^One of few voices of reason at the moment. Seriously, if ever there was a time to listen to me, now would be it.<br><br>4. Thor665<br>^Ambivalent. Not a day two lynch for that alone.<br><br>5. kushm4sta<br>^Townread #2. His posts are confident, but not arrogant. He shows a level of comfort in this game. This is a strong towntell for someone claiming to strongly prefer to be town (especially a newb), since it shows that he's in his element. He's been open and transparent, very willing to explain himself, and even offering up a broadcast of his strategy as scum--a bold move for anyone actually scum, but quite natural as town. In general, I find it easy to sync with his thoughts and I can see where he's coming from more often than not.<br><br>6. MaverickMaestro<br>^You mighta noticed I kinda stopped mentioning him in public. In my QT*, though, it's a different story. Quite frankly, I was hoping to apply pressure to him by day three, but I didn't want to do so while I still had strong leads in kthnx/d3x/Thor. Now that my d3x and Thor reads have weakened, he's definitely worth looking in to.<br><br>7. qwints (replacing Devourer359)<br>^Qwints's posts might not be the strongest in the game, but I still feel as if he's town. AP's town #1, kush is town #2, and qwints is definitely in the running for town spot #3. His hammering on Dave, contrary to what anyone else may have claimed, was town in nature and far, <span class=\"noboldsig\">far</span> too bold for scum, as getting rid of the cop via hammering them and drawing attention to yourself is not worth it; it'd be pretty suicidal, in fact, and ultimately backfire on them. (Yeah, yeah, *insert \"WIFOM!\" cries here*, which I DGAF about; that term's way too overused.)<br><br>8. Jake from State Farm<br>^While a solid candidate for scum, he's a claimed PR. Give him one damn day, okay?<br><br>9. Kthxbye (replacing SafetyDance)<br>^This should be our lynch today. Safety Dance's posts are some of the worst I've ever seen in my 100-game career, and are about as blatantly obvious newb-scum as you can get. He was showing all the classic signs of scum not knowing what the heck they were doing; he was on the defensive and was trying to scrape by on a mislynch rather than be lynched himself. He showed no initiative, he showed no original thoughts (his posts were largely fluff), and if that wasn't enough, kthnxbye--his replacement--did much the same.<br><br>10. d3x<br>^Like Thor, ambivalent. Unlike Thor, I actually have a lean on him:<br>Town.<br><br>Just gut, mainly, at the moment, and I'll eventually need to get a stronger read on him, but he's not a lynch for today.<br><br>11. AngryPidgeon<br>^Towniest town player of all towns. Seriously, read his posts at any stage in the game. Early, mid (end of day one), late (current). They show the exact same picture, someone who is scumhunting and doesn't give a damn that people find him suspicious. He's not backing down from the things he believes in, nor is he concerned about how people view him when he sees a new piece of evidence which changes his read.<br><br>* *insert \"Wait, what?!? YOU HAVE A QT?!?\" here* <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\"><br><br><br><br>So there. The clear lynch candidate for today is kthnx."}

PLUS, he HAS to play the game nightless.  If it becomes obvious that there is a 3rd party killer and I flip non-SK (I will) then Jake is the obv-SK and dies immediately.  Jake HAS to play the game w/o killing anyone for the time being because of that.  That is why I don't care about lynching him too much ATM.  He is scum and that will super obvious later AND he is not a threat due to gimping himself.  He should not be lynched until we see 2 mafia flips.

He replaces in and says he is totally expecting Thor and I to be voting the same person because we are obvtown?  He has no reason to think that we are both obvtown at that point (esp Thor <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\">).  And he has NO reason to think that two townied with hugely different personalities would vote the same person anyways.  His qwints stance is also posturing.  \"Qwints made an anti-town hammer and therefore is scum\" combined with him saying that a scum-flip from Dave would have made qwints probtown.  Does not add up.  Its anti-town or its not.  AND kthx is a hyporcite for not wanting the hammer but keeping Dave at L - 1 anyways.<br><br>Avoiding Me/Jake walls.  He refuses to take an active stance on Me/Jake at the time we are having a firefight in real time.  Why?  Because he is afraid of letting on that he knows Jake is an SK.  Notice that he later accused me of being scum for 'knowing more than I should'.  This is because he is carefully avoiding letting on that he knows more than he should about Jake.  Which is why he thought to accuse me of that in the first place.  Plus it can but him town cookies when I flip town and he can be all like \"Woah, I had no idea.  See <span class=\"noboldsig\">I</span> am the one that is lacking of inside information because I was wrong about AP!  Clearly Im town!\"  Not.<br><br>Zipper, Kthx changed his opinion on me, you should vote him.  Since that is a scumtell and all.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">About Mastin</span><br>My gut tells me Mastin is scum.  His playstyle is indistinguishable as town/scum and I've read his games / played with him before.  I know he is capable of this hyper-buddying as either alignment.  Still, Id rather lynch Kthx today and tell everyone to bear in mind that Mastin could still be scum.  <br><br>You could maybe be right about Zipper?  I need to reread that.  Zipper could just be one of those players that is so bad it makes me think they are scum.

Jake suspects he was shot for this reason and gets ready to claim commuter (a fairly unlikely, role all things considered).  A commuter claim explains why he isn't killed throughout the game (its like a PGO claim in a sense) because an x-shot commuter can out-WIFOM the scumteam.  And if Jake is an SK and suspects he was shot last night (for obvious reasons), then he absolutely would have reason to believe that I slipped about it or am reaction testing him about it to see if he will flail.

Second, Even if you had, a SINGLE game of scum meta is not a valid rason for you to be so adamant about clearing me.

That horrible IIoA waffle about my motivations.  Doesnt draw any serious conclusions, but is rather just trying to show that he can put himself in my mind in hypothetical situations.  Note that there is no overall point or summary to his post.  Its because town posts shit with the intention of making a point (good or bad).  Scum qwints is just trying to show he can think like a townie.<br><br>4. Accusing Zipper of scum-slipping for daytalk w/o making any effort to back that up with possible meta (since that would be an actually good time to look at his past experiences and see if they check out with his assumption that scum have daytalk)."}

Also his wall on my motivations never reaches a conclusion - it looks like posting for the sake of posting.  Him writing off Mastin calling me town as normal because \"Mastin read thirsty souls\" is absolutely ridiculous.  I already explained why.  And he didn't care about Kthx linking us and being a hypocrite about Dave.  Just seems off.  Also I dont like him jumping ship to MM when Jake starts it.<br><br>Kush: Mehhh.  Ive been giving him a blind eye, I need to ISO him.  But his vote on me and subsequent points looked incredibly fake.  Hes voting me for policy?  After a D1 cop lynch?  And he clearly thinks Kthx has a great chance of flipping scum?  Giving me the exact same vibes as scum-Declan_Giggs from open space.

It's the epitome of trying to get a mislynch through without over committing himself. He pushes for a claim without stating intent to hammer (even expressly disclaiming it.)

When Dave claims, he  attacks the claim by asking \"any breadcrumbs\" and continues to call Dave scummy without suggesting that he will hammer. He ignores Jake's comments about policy. Those posts look to me like a cautious scum letting town lynch a scummy player. His play is similar on day 2.

I don't anything but 2 facts:  I'm a town PR that's been RB'ed all game after I had to claim and KJ is scum cuz he's not dead yet.

The reason you are a <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">much higher</span> probability of being town over Cyber, is because you are actually asking questions to try and figure this out where as Cyber is being lurker after his vote.

Saying I'm scum cuz I said I received extra PM's on nights when I tried to perform an action and it got blocked resulting in me still having a shot is like trying to say a claimed Cop is scum cuz he received more PM's than everyone else to get the results of his/her night actions.<br><br>@Jake:  For shame on you for thinking this was even close to an issue.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Mod:  You didn't have to come in here to verify, but thanks</span><br><br>p.edit:  @KJ:  no, you nor anyone else received any PM for the start of day 4...oh, except me as I tried to shoot Qwints for the second time.  The Generic PM's aren't even an issue.  I received separate PM's other than the Generic ones (2 to be exact).  That's what you are trying to cast doubt on....of course it's dumb to try and do so as I explained above.  So, before you ask, yes, I received 4 PM's for this game (excluding role).  2 generic and 1 1 after N2 and N3."}

I failed and tbh, you aren't making bad points or coming up with bad reasoning to vote me.  KJ just out played me is all.  It's why I got all pissy.  I even talked to my wife about it...and she reminded me it's just a game.  So yeah, sorry for the AtE crap.  It's just frustrating ya know?  Anyway, there is no doubt that either KJ or myself will be lynched today.  I have little doubt that you or Thor are scum.  If Thor is scum, he's being an asshat right now by not ending it and if you are scum, you played a near perfect game.  That leaves 2 scum between me, KJ, or Cyber.  KJ and I are as thor stated, almost definitely not on the same side.  Because there are 2 scum out of the 3 of us, unless what I've already stated about you or Thor being scum is true, Cyber by default has to be the other scum.  From the outside (you and Thor) I can only imagine it's a nightmare but that doesn't make it any less frustrating for me.  Understand?  I would love to win, but scum are just playing a very good game.  There is literally nothing else I can do.  I'll refrain from self-voting but don't be all surprised when Cyber get's replaced (or logs in to see I'm at L-1) and votes me.  After this game, I'd like some tips on what I did poorly to avoid them in future games."}
