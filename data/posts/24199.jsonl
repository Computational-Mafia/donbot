He wandered its re-arranged aisles anyway, itching at his new (and excellent) haircut. In the week he'd been out, his clothing had begun to fit him better, which in its way had lessened the sense of foreboding he'd felt on his arrival back in town. Why, then, the lingering dread as he considered the picked-over Bestseller shelves, the pine tables with their CLEARANCE stickers, the supple thuk-thuk-thuk of the twin escalators (he remembered those well). Where once had sat four rows of Fiction and Literature now were bright pyramids of puzzles, board games, Lego; on the far side, near the bank of floor-to-ceiling windows, empty faded carpet criss-crossed by dark impressions where shelves had once sat. <br>\n<br>\nThings he didn't know: 1. The name of the man he was here to meet; 2. The exact reason(s) (though here he had a pretty good idea); 3. What it was, exactly, he planned to do if that pretty good idea turned out to be the gospel truth. He was unarmed; no one knew he was here. A lot had to have changed since he'd gone down those twenty years before, but he knew all too well the trouble with assumptions, the flaw inherent in trust. Yet here he was. Alone. Free. And possibly, he knew, a liability. <br>\n<br>\nAnd&#8230; then he died somehow. The Mafia did it. You all thought the Mafia was gone.

Voting:</div> Votes and unvotes must be in bold to be counted. (Ex: <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: Dunhamganger</div>.) You do not have to unvote between votes for the next vote to be counted. You may <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">unvote</div> at any time and need not specify who you were voting for.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\"> 2.Lynching</div>: Lynches require a simple majority of votes. Once that majority is reached, a lynch is achieved and further votes or unvotes will have no effect. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">3. No Lynch</div>: You may <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: No lynch</div> if you wish to end the day without lynching (herp). No Lynch will also require a simple majority.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">4. Deadline</div>: This game will function on a cycle of strict 3-week days. Replacements near deadline will extend that deadline by a maximum of 3 days. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">5. Deadline Lynch</div>: When the deadline passes, if no player has a majority of the votes, the player with the most votes will be lynched. If more than one player is tied for the most votes, no lynch will occur<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">6. Night and Night Actions</div>: Night will last for 72 hours maximum. Night actions not received within those 72 hours will not occur. Night actions will be resolved using Natural Action Resolution. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">7. Lurking</div>: Players who sign up in this game are expected to actively post and participate. Players who do not post for 72 hours without prior warning will be prodded. Failure to respond to a prod within 48 hours will result in replacement. Lurking will not be a viable strategy in this game and players who are consistently prodded or post only to avoid being prodded will be replaced at the Mod's discretion. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">8. Out-Of-Thread/Beyond-The-Grave Communication</div>: The game is not to be discussed outside the thread unless your role specifically states that you may do so, and then only in the manner stated in your role PM. Don't quote any out-of-thread communications regarding this game in the thread; this includes your role PM. In addition, once you're dead, you may post exactly once more (often called a \"Bah\" post) before endgame, and it may not contain relevant game content. Any violation of this rule is a modkillable offense. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">9. Posting Style</div>: Do not use odd colors, font size, or excessive images in your posts. Do not be unduly abusive to your fellow players. Do not edit or delete your previous posts. No codes or foreign languages. Failure to meet these criteria will result in warnings and/or replacement.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">10. V/LA</div>: If you are going to be V/LA, please post in the thread if at all possible. Do not assume that a simple site-wide announcement will suffice. Please treat this game like a commitment and respect the time and enjoyment of your fellow players.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">11. Questions, Comments, Concerns</div>: If you have any questions that need to be addressed outside of the thread, please PM me. Otherwise, you may get my attention using either of the following formats: <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">@Dunhamganger</div>, <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">@Mod</div>.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">12. Playing to Win</div>: If at any point I deem you to be playing against your win condition, you will be modkilled. No exceptions. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">13. Catch-All</div>: If you seem to be violating the spirit of these rules while operating under the letter of them, I will take appropriate action. Fair warning.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">14. Fun</div>: Having fun is by no means mandatory, but I would vastly prefer that each of you have some amount of it. If there's anything I can do to ensure that you do, please do not hesitate to let me know.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">15. Modkills</div>: A modkill will result in the day ending as if a lynch had occurred. Cool.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Sample Role PM:</div><br>\n<br>\nThis is a closed set-up. At least one player has the following role:<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Dunhamganger wrote:</cite>Welcome to Bubble Tape Mafia, _________. You are a <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vanilla Townie</div>. You may post and vote during the day.

Using meta checks is a REALLY easy way to look like you are doing something.  Both town and scum do it and its not really a tell.

Ok so you think the individual votes here are suspect, where does the blanket statement that one of the first 3 is prob-scum come from then?  Why not specify that the individual votes were what was scummy in the first place?  Because the way you said it implied that the wagon was scummy and therefore someone on it was scum.  (Which is true and that person has a \"Best Mafia\" bumpersticker and a beard.<br>\n<br>\nSeriously though, why is Thor's vote not suspect?  He is, much like scummy Cyber, voting for policy.

It was my first post and out of everything I saw on page one that was what leapt out at me as suspicious  because to me its confusing why someone would post like that. There's bragging in it, he's posted his playing style like we should accept it as fact. How on earth could we trust anything like that on page 1? I still can't trust anything said now.<br>\n<br>\nHe still hasn't answered why he would post such a thing except for saying don't vote him or an AtE post. That doesn't let him off the hook in my opinion.<br>\n<br>\nI'm not sure I follow your second quote here. I only posted a couple of times afterwards before I had to leave the computer. Not sure where 'continued' comes into or where I needed to explain the wagon. I can't explain the wagon, I have no idea who the other people are who voted for him afterwards or why they did so except for their own reasons stated in their post.<br>\n<br>\n***<br>\n<br>\nThe following four pages are difficult to read. There seems to be a lot of bickering between posters. Nothing stands out at the moment but then my eyes started to glaze other some of those quote-walls. Will just have to re-read again to see if anything hints at scum.<br>\n<br>\nSome rambling thoughts:<br>\n-Jake From State Farm: has barely said anything of substance in any of his posts. Why? What does role-playing a commercial achieve?<br>\n-AngryPidgeon/Thor665: their discussions with each other, one of them may be right. can they both be right/wrong? Can't really get any definite town or scum reads from either but arguing over 2-3 pages this early on, I think one at least will be definite town.<br>\n-zipperflesh: why was he sheeping thor in the first place and now defending/agreeing with him in the same arguments?  Is there a meta-clique here or is it a game strategy? It doesn't seem smart for maf to band together so obviously so early on but then everyone seems to be very experienced so is it a case of wifom?<br>\n-dave168/d3x: both are asking a lot of questions which makes the appear very pro-town. which could mean they're trying to appear town because their scum and information works both ways too.", "time": "Mon Dec 03, 2012 11:38 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=24199&start=125", "forum": "53", "thread": "24199"}

Could either of you be scum, sure, but as for now I got a town on town piss match for multiple pages.  At times, you hurt my head.  In my limited experience, when people argue semantics back and forth for several pages, it usually ends up being to strong headed town.  I have noticed however that AP likes to put words in peoples mouths.  Example being me saying \"hardly surprised\" and AP coming back with \"expected\".  <br>\n<br>\nAP:  To answer your question, I have town reads on both of you.  I also think you both to be non-noobs.  I'm hardly surprised to see you both voting Dave because although you 2 went back and forth, I don't see anything from either of you that would justify being stubborn enough to miss what I see as scum-slip posts from Dave.<br>\n<br>\nDave:  The triple post is the scummiest thing I've seen in this game thus far and that's where my vote will be going at the end of this post.<br>\n<br>\nd3x:  I have played with him before and know enough of him to get a town vibe from his posts.  As for your case on cyber, it's not without merit and if I thought dave's triple post honest instead of slippage, I'd be looking more into it.  I'd say he's in my top 3, kush beating him out for 2nd.<br>\n<br>\nCyber:  leaning scum.  mainly due to the points brought up by d3x and his case post.  Though I actually completely agree with his latest post. <br>\n<br>\nJfSF:  null read on Jake.  Would like to know how my introduction to this game post is \"a scum post if I ever saw one\".  On that note, if you really think that, where is your vote on me?  If you don't really think that, are you waiting for someone to agree with you to start a new wagon off your scum-buddy Dave?<br>\n<br>\nMM:  leaning scum read on this one.  Nothing in his posts even remotely helps town.  Nothing but fluff but just enough to look active.<br>\n<br>\nZipper:  null read leaning town.  Nothing jumps out at me as scummy but a few points were made that I don't disagree with.  p129 in particular, though I don't agree with his vote, his reasoning isn't without merit imo.<br>\n<br>\nkush:  getting scum vibe pretty strong from this one.  emotional start to his wagon and lurking till dave's wagon took off.  now we have some more posting from him.

{"number": 395, "id": "4521681", "user": "Jake from State Farm", "user_id": "19874", "content": "OK so going back to where I left off earlier with the question about me using something from a game recently where scum did something and how it applies here.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nIn the game where scum got lynched, the key that set some people off was the fact that a RVS wagon was forming and instead of using a random reason he tried to justify his vote to join the wagon. When questioned about it he eventually cracked and he was lynched. YAY scum lynch day 1 is awesome.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nSo this game we have 2 people starting a mini wagon (sure 2 votes can be a mini wagon) and instead of just joining the wagon for some random reason (or no reason at all) he felt the need to justify his vote with an actual reason. He admits he is joining a wagon when he says <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">\"Better join the wagon then\"</div><br>\n<br>\n<br>\nHe is a newish player if you look at his topic list he has only played in 2 games and they were newbie games AND he was town in both of them.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">IN MY OPINION:</div> N00bscum would be afraid of the backlash from wagoning someone, especially early on. Since he isn't experienced he wouldn't know that RVS wagons are common on MS. Not knowing this informagtion, they are often more likely to try and justify their vote so they can point back to it later and say \"SEE, I had a good reason for it\" and he can point to these votes to try and paint them as scum. <br>\n<br>\nYou can see he believes this based on this little number from post 313. <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Also, if someone joins a wagon, surely its better that they have any reason (reliable or otherwise) rather than sheeping someone else? </div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nBut wait there is more.<br>\n<br>\nHis very first game on site he was told to go to the wiki and learn about RVS so unless he chose to ignore this request (unlikely since he was town and he was brand new to the site) or he forgot somehow (possible but unlikely) SO why would he try and paint an RVS vote as scummy?<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>@MM: I have to start somewhere.

You either do or you don't care enough to or you forget to.<br>\n-Dave's appeal to fear was a supposed 'crumb' \"Don't make me claim its a bad idea\".  Which in itself is a softclaim and there is no way town Dave drops such a blatant softclaim and expects anyone to believe that it wasn't obviously a PR claim as is and therefore USELESS.  Why not just full claim?<br>\n-Cop is a hard to believe role title.  But possible.  This is a minor point.<br>\n-The claim itself is awkward.  A cop is a cop.  There is no super need to paraphrase the role PM so explicitly because we already know what a cop does.  Dave is just acting like he is parsing a role PM that doesnt exist.<br>\n-If Dave were a cop and had previously self-reflected on possibly being not-sane, he would have done enough research to figure out that that is impossible in mini normals.  This is just more fake emotions / song dance about the role pm<br>\n<br>\nSorry Dave.  No ill will.  But you have a scum card and Jake should hammer that.</div></blockquote><br>\nMy role is \"Cop\", not \"Sane Cop\" as in current newbies, or any other variant of cop. Just Cop, nothing else.<br>\n<br>\nWhen I got my role, I looked up <a href=\"http://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Cop\" class=\"postlink\">http://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Cop</a><br>\n<br>\nI saw 5 sanities listed there. Due to the difference between the current newbie setup which I researched (due to signing up for SE on newbie queue), and the role I received, I considered it likely that my results could be suspect. However, I hadn't understood the setup correctly; that is, I hadn't linked the forum we are playing in with the statement \"This version of the Cop, and only this version of the Cop, is considered Normal on mafiascum.net. \" So yes you are correct, in this case Cop must mean Sane Cop, and it was unnecessary of me to doubt my sanity.<br>\n<br>\nThere might be someone out there who can verify if I am town or scum at some point. If you're so sure I'm scum why not lynch me later in the game in the absence of evidence I am innocent? At least then when I flip town cop you will have a couple of results, assuming I survive that long.", "time": "Thu Dec 06, 2012 8:39 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=24199&start=425", "forum": "53", "thread": "24199"}

You can read into this that one or both of the other two are Scum and that's why they didn't bite it, or that it was random.  I think enough of us had blood on our hands D1 that it'd be a safe bet that we would all be pretty much at each others throats today.

I can think of a ton of scummy you reasons you would do it.  You like attention.

I can see how you read it this way.  In context however, I was having discussions with AP and he asked me about Thor.  Yeah, I just checked, AP brought Thor into the convo.<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4530796#p4530796\" class=\"postlink\">p610</a> is just laughable.  Of course I was ok with the Lynch.  I was not shy in making those statements.  I believe he read scummy.  Even after finding out that he was legit the Cop, he still reads as scummy.  That's the overwhelming danger of playing a Cop with a slice of scummy.  You don't draw the NK as easily, but you sure make the misLynch easier.  Regarding my 'RoleFishing', you're piling up the scummy points, mastin.  I was answering directly to Dave's question.

Read any single one of my games {Town or Scum} and you'll see that.<br>\n2- Money where Mouth is- I have my strong Scum reads and I will push those Wagons {even when I'm alone}.  I will build my cases for them.  I will also add to the discussion on others' play that I think is scummy.

I will gauge how likely I find it to be legit and support it if necessary.<br>\n3- Opportunistic- You forgot MM, lol.  I believe them to be scummy.  They are more than welcome to come in here and refute my points.  Until said time, I don't see how my stance can change on their play.  Besides, do you think it would be harmful to the town if they came in here and played?  Are you so sure that they are not Scum?  Can you say that with 100% certainty?  Because if not, they need to get tehir asses in here and play the game.  Lurking should never be a viable strat and should be frowned upon.<br>\n4- Discrediting Othes- If I don't believe their points to be valid... uh, yeah.  I'ma gonna discredit them.  If you say the sky is lavendar and try to pass that off as truth, I will tell you you are wrong.<br>\n5- Acive Lurking- I find this the most difficult to swallow, honestly.

I could also be a Vig.  Why does Jake immediately assume I am an SK and not one of the other 2 (especially mafia)?

He has no reason to assume that when mafia-AP is MORE likely from his perspective if he really is town.  There is no reason why SK couldnt have killed DoubleJD and the mafia team (me) tried to target Jake.  But he assumes the reverse FOR NO REASON WHATSOEVER.  In fact, Jake HAS to be an SK and not just mafia here.  If Jake is mafia, he has to be a BP goon.  He has no reason to believe I am an SK (there was only one kill last night) unless his team shot someone BP who would then be the SK.  (And that isnt me).  <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">THEREFORE Jake HAS to be the SK.</div><br>\n<br>\n2. Jake preemptively defends/OMGUS's from my opening post.  Why is he so overly defensive for absolutely no reason?  Because he KNOWS that he was shot at.  Him jumping to conclusions about my post proves it. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"> How could he know that unless he knows who is responsible for the DoubleJD kill?  He killed DoubleJD.</div>  The mafia tried to kill Jake which brings me to point 3.<br>\n<br>\n3. His claim.  <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">X-shot commuter is a very rare PR. </div> In fact, it is not even in the list of  mafiascum approved <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">normal </div>roles: <a href=\"http://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Normal_Game\" class=\"postlink\">http://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Normal_Game</a><br>\nESPECIALLY given that this is Dunham's first modded game, I doubt he would push normal boundaries.  This is occam's razor.  I will fucking murder anyone that calls WIFOM on this.<br>\nAlso it makes perfect sense for an SK in his situation.

From his SK perspective, my opening 180 at the start of the day looks odd.  (And just read his response to it and tell me that isn't someone who KNOWS they are backed into a corner).  He knows mafia targeted him last night (or very strongly suspects it, given the lack of NK other than his) and he sees my vote as a sign that I know he is scum all of a sudden based on the lack of a mafia NK.  He then preemptively jumps the gun and accuses me of being scum for 'slipping' about targeting him.  Jake firmly believes I am mafia and is trying to 1v1 me for that reason.  Why did he call me an SK then?  He has no reason to make that assumption as town.  He DOES have a reason to call me an SK as the SK though: if I flip mafia, it gives him towncred for pushing me AND it looks like he isn't the SK because he was the first person to suggest there is an SK and that I was it.

I could also be a Vig.  Why does Jake immediately assume I am an SK and not one of the other 2 (especially mafia)?  Note that there would be a 2 or 3x more likelihood of me being mafia anyways in this situation anyways!<br>\n<br>\nTL;DR:<br>\n1. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Jake assumes I am an SK after I 'slip' on targeting him</div>.  He has no reason to assume that when mafia-AP is MORE likely from his perspective if he really is town.  There is no reason why SK couldnt have killed DoubleJD and the mafia team (me) tried to target Jake.  But he assumes the reverse FOR NO REASON WHATSOEVER.  In fact, Jake HAS to be an SK and not just mafia here.  If Jake is mafia, he has to be a BP goon.  He has no reason to believe I am an SK (there was only one kill last night) unless his team shot someone BP who would then be the SK.  (And that isnt me).  <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">THEREFORE Jake HAS to be the SK.</div><br>\n<br>\n2. Jake preemptively defends/OMGUS's from my opening post.  Why is he so overly defensive for absolutely no reason?  Because he KNOWS that he was shot at.  Him jumping to conclusions about my post proves it. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"> How could he know that unless he knows who is responsible for the DoubleJD kill?  He killed DoubleJD.</div>  The mafia tried to kill Jake which brings me to point 3.<br>\n<br>\n3. His claim.  <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">X-shot commuter is a very rare PR. </div> In fact, it is not even in the list of  mafiascum approved <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">normal </div>roles: <a href=\"http://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Normal_Game\" class=\"postlink\">http://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Normal_Game</a><br>\nESPECIALLY given that this is Dunham's first modded game, I doubt he would push normal boundaries.  This is occam's razor.  I will fucking murder anyone that calls WIFOM on this.<br>\nAlso it makes perfect sense for an SK in his situation.  His claim has just enough to it to be able to handwave away any doubts about him not being NK'd for the rest of the game.</div></blockquote><br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I say its odd he is alive because he was a good NK target for scum.

Pfft<br>\n<br>\nSee if you were half serious, than me being alive would not be THAT big of a suprise. Which means your 180 on me because I was alive becomes invalid. Maybe I jumped the gun and you really are a VT but it's pretty obvious to me you were about to claim vig. Me being a vig target makes sense. <br>\n<br>\nIf I jumped the gun and you are a VT than your play and your 180 on me makes no sense.

We can come back to him another time.<br>\n<br>\n2. Cybertronix<br>\n^Cyber's posting started out weak, but it's gotten stronger and stronger as the game has progressed. He's been raising good points and has shown a clear town train of thought. His stances have been strong, and his posts have been transparent. Add to that, he has a town tone to his posts; his way of negotiating with others feels incredibly natural.<br>\n<br>\n3. mastin2 (replacing Leonshade)<br>\n^One of few voices of reason at the moment. Seriously, if ever there was a time to listen to me, now would be it.<br>\n<br>\n4. Thor665<br>\n^Ambivalent. Not a day two lynch for that alone.<br>\n<br>\n5. kushm4sta<br>\n^Townread #2. His posts are confident, but not arrogant. He shows a level of comfort in this game. This is a strong towntell for someone claiming to strongly prefer to be town (especially a newb), since it shows that he's in his element. He's been open and transparent, very willing to explain himself, and even offering up a broadcast of his strategy as scum--a bold move for anyone actually scum, but quite natural as town. In general, I find it easy to sync with his thoughts and I can see where he's coming from more often than not.<br>\n<br>\n6. MaverickMaestro<br>\n^You mighta noticed I kinda stopped mentioning him in public. In my QT*, though, it's a different story. Quite frankly, I was hoping to apply pressure to him by day three, but I didn't want to do so while I still had strong leads in kthnx/d3x/Thor. Now that my d3x and Thor reads have weakened, he's definitely worth looking in to.<br>\n<br>\n7. qwints (replacing Devourer359)<br>\n^Qwints's posts might not be the strongest in the game, but I still feel as if he's town. AP's town #1, kush is town #2, and qwints is definitely in the running for town spot #3. His hammering on Dave, contrary to what anyone else may have claimed, was town in nature and far, <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">far</div> too bold for scum, as getting rid of the cop via hammering them and drawing attention to yourself is not worth it; it'd be pretty suicidal, in fact, and ultimately backfire on them. (Yeah, yeah, *insert \"WIFOM!\" cries here*, which I DGAF about; that term's way too overused.)<br>\n<br>\n8. Jake from State Farm<br>\n^While a solid candidate for scum, he's a claimed PR. Give him one damn day, okay?<br>\n<br>\n9. Kthxbye (replacing SafetyDance)<br>\n^This should be our lynch today. Safety Dance's posts are some of the worst I've ever seen in my 100-game career, and are about as blatantly obvious newb-scum as you can get. He was showing all the classic signs of scum not knowing what the heck they were doing; he was on the defensive and was trying to scrape by on a mislynch rather than be lynched himself. He showed no initiative, he showed no original thoughts (his posts were largely fluff), and if that wasn't enough, kthnxbye--his replacement--did much the same.<br>\n<br>\n10. d3x<br>\n^Like Thor, ambivalent. Unlike Thor, I actually have a lean on him:<br>\nTown.<br>\n<br>\nJust gut, mainly, at the moment, and I'll eventually need to get a stronger read on him, but he's not a lynch for today.<br>\n<br>\n11. AngryPidgeon<br>\n^Towniest town player of all towns. Seriously, read his posts at any stage in the game. Early, mid (end of day one), late (current). They show the exact same picture, someone who is scumhunting and doesn't give a damn that people find him suspicious. He's not backing down from the things he believes in, nor is he concerned about how people view him when he sees a new piece of evidence which changes his read.<br>\n<br>\n* *insert \"Wait, what?!?

PLUS, he HAS to play the game nightless.  If it becomes obvious that there is a 3rd party killer and I flip non-SK (I will) then Jake is the obv-SK and dies immediately.  Jake HAS to play the game w/o killing anyone for the time being because of that.  That is why I don't care about lynching him too much ATM.  He is scum and that will super obvious later AND he is not a threat due to gimping himself.  He should not be lynched until we see 2 mafia flips.  Then Jake should go.<br>\n<br>\n@Zipper: I'm town and Im telling you right fucking now what my flip confirms.  Kthx is scum.  Jake is an SK.  Mastin/qwints probscum.  Thats. it.<br>\n<br>\n@Jake: So why did I claim VT over Vig then ESPECIALLY since you had just claimed a role that could confirm me as a being a vig that shot you?  Your logic is flailing.  And no, I NEVER claimed to have shot you.  Your overreaction to my silly speculation was an SK claim and its obvious as shit that you think I am mafia and that you are in fact an SK.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Why Kthxbye is scum</div><br>\nPosturing.  He replaces in and says he is totally expecting Thor and I to be voting the same person because we are obvtown?  He has no reason to think that we are both obvtown at that point (esp Thor <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\">).  And he has NO reason to think that two townied with hugely different personalities would vote the same person anyways.  His qwints stance is also posturing.  \"Qwints made an anti-town hammer and therefore is scum\" combined with him saying that a scum-flip from Dave would have made qwints probtown.  Does not add up.  Its anti-town or its not.  AND kthx is a hyporcite for not wanting the hammer but keeping Dave at L - 1 anyways.<br>\n<br>\nAvoiding Me/Jake walls.  He refuses to take an active stance on Me/Jake at the time we are having a firefight in real time.  Why?  Because he is afraid of letting on that he knows Jake is an SK.  Notice that he later accused me of being scum for 'knowing more than I should'.  This is because he is carefully avoiding letting on that he knows more than he should about Jake.  Which is why he thought to accuse me of that in the first place.  Plus it can but him town cookies when I flip town and he can be all like \"Woah, I had no idea.  See <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">I</div> am the one that is lacking of inside information because I was wrong about AP!  Clearly Im town!\"  Not.<br>\n<br>\nZipper, Kthx changed his opinion on me, you should vote him.  Since that is a scumtell and all.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">About Mastin</div><br>\nMy gut tells me Mastin is scum.  His playstyle is indistinguishable as town/scum and I've read his games / played with him before.  I know he is capable of this hyper-buddying as either alignment.  Still, Id rather lynch Kthx today and tell everyone to bear in mind that Mastin could still be scum.  <br>\n<br>\nYou could maybe be right about Zipper?  I need to reread that.  Zipper could just be one of those players that is so bad it makes me think they are scum.  And I find it a little unlikely that he/Kthx team would lead the charge on me together.<br>\n<br>\nMy best Town reads: Kush, Cyber, Maverick", "time": "Tue Dec 11, 2012 7:44 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=24199&start=750", "forum": "53", "thread": "24199"}

That is an unbelievably weak way to get a read and I absolutely expect better analysis from qwints.  Also his wall on my motivations never reaches a conclusion - it looks like posting for the sake of posting.  Him writing off Mastin calling me town as normal because \"Mastin read thirsty souls\" is absolutely ridiculous.  I already explained why.  And he didn't care about Kthx linking us and being a hypocrite about Dave.  Just seems off.  Also I dont like him jumping ship to MM when Jake starts it.<br>\n<br>\nKush: Mehhh.  Ive been giving him a blind eye, I need to ISO him.  But his vote on me and subsequent points looked incredibly fake.  Hes voting me for policy?  After a D1 cop lynch?  And he clearly thinks Kthx has a great chance of flipping scum?  Giving me the exact same vibes as scum-Declan_Giggs from open space.

It's the epitome of trying to get a mislynch through without over committing himself. He pushes for a claim without stating intent to hammer (even expressly disclaiming it.) He agrees that they should lynch dave after the replacements chime in.  When Dave claims, he  attacks the claim by asking \"any breadcrumbs\" and continues to call Dave scummy without suggesting that he will hammer. He ignores Jake's comments about policy. Those posts look to me like a cautious scum letting town lynch a scummy player. His play is similar on day 2. Although he actually has his vote on Kush, he's not a big part of the quick wagon on Kush. He follows AP's vote with a quick summary of Kush's play but doesn't really press the case. <br>\n<br>\nFinally, note that D3x claims he thought kthx was going to shoot him.

The above on KJ and overall distrust of the slot he replaced into has me more suspicious than the possibility that Thor bussed Zipper from day2 till his lynch.

With the above quotes on KJ, what would you say to a KJ/Jake team with KJ going hard after his partner knowing nobody was going to follow a Jake wagon with Qwints, d3x, Zipper, and yourself (who at the time more than 1 person called prob-scum) still alive?<br>\n<br>\np.edit:  I'm not sure NL isn't a bad idea.

There are often many different ways to attacking the same problem.

The doctor never showed up to save the person, the jailkeeper never locked a person up, the vigilante never used their shot, the cop never investigated their target, and so on, because before they do so, the roleblocker stops them.<br>\n<br>\nThe roleblocker doesn't magically make the doctor's medkit fail, doesn't magically give the locked up person a key which leaves their cell vulnerable, doesn't magically grab the bullet from the vigilante after it's been used, doesn't magically destroy the cop's evidence before he's analyzed it, and so on.<br>\n<br>\nIf you want a non-flavor reason, NAR as I interpret it means the roleblock happens before the action--and therefore the action never happens.
