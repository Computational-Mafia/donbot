Your vote is on chaoslord and it's a red-herring vote, so you're the last person to talk about \"bad votes\".  <br>\n<br>\n2. How do you know I'm assuming he's town?  You see the part where several people are waiting on responses?  That's the proper thing to do.  I don't think Josh's post are so bad that he deserves to be at L-3: which I personally feel is a tipping point on a d-1 lynch.  You do see the part where I said \"at least he's trying\" right?  That doesn't mean I think he's town or scum it just means he's putting in effort.<br>\n<br>\n3. I didn't like bacde's response.  You do realize people have differing opinions on things right?  You're being really presumptious and pushy too.  You're making all kinds of assumptions about other players.<br>\n<br>\n4. Newbscum would put Josh at L-3, that previously mentioned tipping point.  The fact that chaoslord wanted to wait before putting down a vote suggests that he's not newbscum.<br>\n<br>\n5.  And I don't care that Josh had three votes because he's \"earned\" those three votes.  His posting isn't great but I don't think he deserves to have a developing wagon: at least not before he clarifies a few things.<br>\n<br>\nI'm fine with being asked questions but you make several leaps of logic in these questions.  The fact that bacde and I agree on chaoslord for independent reasons suggests that my vote on him may be a bad one.  Then compare that you your leaps in logic to build a case and well...<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Elyse</span>", "time": "Fri Jun 13, 2014 7:40 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=57502&start=75", "forum": "53", "thread": "57502"}

His continued \"too easy\" OMGUSing is something I'd shy away from if I were scum. It seemed like he was trying to make a solid meta case on another player. Giving a year old game as a reason for voting someone is off balance, I recognized that immediately and was challenging him on it. Town may have won, but it was Slaander that hammered bacde, Hence the reason for me thinking that bacde was sour over it. <br>\n<br>\nAt SKOT, I think you misunderstood my point about RVS being a serious thing.

{"number": 380, "id": "5951399", "user": "Wake1", "user_id": "22272", "content": "Alright. To recap.<br>\n<br>\nIn <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5950015#p5950015\">237</a> I mused at chaoslord's <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5943438#p5943438\">41</a>, in which he said it wasn't his intent to manipulate. Later in that post he said that if he came off as manipulative then that was not what he intended at all. The reason I questioned manipulation being unintentional... is that Psychological manipulation is a type of social influence that aims to change the perception or behavior of others through underhanded, deceptive, or even abusive tactics.<a href=\"https://www.google.com/#q=what+is+manipulation\" class=\"postlink\">*</a> When something is underhanded, deceptive, or even abusive, how is it not intentional? If someone's being unintentionally manipulative, it must mean that that person must be rather manipulative in general, right? <br>\n<br>\nOddly, bacde jumps in to defend chaoslord from my question. If the point of Mafia is to question players and gauge their reactions, why would a supposed Townie get in the way of it? I think he's mainly being combative and belligerent, as though he doesn't want me doing what I'm supposed to be doing. Only Scum has reason to obfuscate and hinder the information-gathering process. <br>\n<br>\nWhat T S O said in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5950052#p5950052\">243</a> sums it up, basically. I have never heard of someone \"accidentally\" manipulating someone. Bacde's ardent defense of chaoslord being Town when we're only in Day 1 makes no sense, which makes me wonder what he's doing there, as well. Another thing of note is that in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5950055#p5950055\">245</a> bacde said CL (chaoslord) didn't admit to being manipulative, yet in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5943438#p5943438\">41</a> CL did say he didn't intend to manipulate, and later in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5950082#p5950082\">253</a> Mirhawk says CL confessed as soon as he called him on it. <br>\n<br>\nThroughout this discussion bacde's tried to force me to say that I either think CL was being manipulative or isn't, when the actual issue was me questioning CL on whether it's even possible for manipulation to be unintentional. In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5950055#p5950055\">245</a> he starts trying to derail my inquiry onto something else. Townies son't derail inquiry. Scum does, though. He also assumes I don't have any reservations on other issues, either. I'm simply at the top of my list. There's a reason my analysis took a while.What also sounds like obfuscation is how bacde in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5950066#p5950066\">248</a> says that he got a kind \"fuck you\" from CL's <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5943438#p5943438\">41</a>. I didn't in the slightest, and I'd like an explanation from bacde on what specifically makes him get that feeling from CL's post.<br>\n<br>\nAlso note in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5950073#p5950073\">251</a> when I asked bacde how he got a kind \"fuck you\" from CL's post he never answered it[/post] in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5950076#p5950076\">252</a>. Whether that was deliberate or not I don't know, so I want answers. Mirhawk in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5950082#p5950082\">253</a> says it's perfectly possible to unintentionall manipulate people, yet I still haven't found any sort of credible source that says it's possible, or common. And if it is indeed very rare, why? And I do note the feeling that he's downplaying this by calling this curiosity of mine unimportant. Seeing as there's likely 3 scum we're dealing with, I'm more than a little conscious of claims over what is and isn't important. No one gets to decide what is and isn't important to question. Seeing that bacde at least twice requoted my posts before I had responded also makes me question what exactly he's doing, and why. <br>\n<br>\nYet again bacde, like an annoyed defense attorney/obfuscator, tries to get me to say whether I think CL was being manipulative or not, when that's what I'm trying to figure out: <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5950126#p5950126\">259</a>. Again in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5950132#p5950132\">260</a> he pesters by trying to get me to look elsewhere, while quipping that I haven't been reading the thread even though my first posts make it quite clear that I was. This kind of defense-attorney-like stuff is why I cast my vote against him in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5950136#p5950136\">261</a>. He then in the next post puts me in his Scumpile while not being specific as to why. Mirhawk then tries to define manipulation in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5950141#p5950141\">264</a>, even though, according to <a href=\"http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/manipulate\" class=\"postlink\">Oxford</a>, manipulation is either 1) handling or controlling (a tool, mechanism, etc.), typically in a skillful manner or 2) controlling or influencing (a person or situation) cleverly, unfairly, or unscrupulously. I do wonder about Mirhawk's latest posts up to that point.<br>\n<br>\nInterestingly in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5950144#p5950144\">266</a> he then incorrectly says why I voted for him. I voted for bacde because he's being like a defense attorney, trying to shift my focus elsewhere, and taking my words out of context. I won't stop until my curiosity is satisfied, so when you get in the way of the flow of gathering information, to the point where I feel I'm being unsuccessfully manipulated, I'll not hesitate to cast my vote and gauge your next reactions. Funny how bacde thinks CL is Town when it's only Day 1, and how he says which issues are relevant and which aren't: <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5950147#p5950147\">267</a>. He's just awfully combative and defensive. How about you bacde let CL respond to the question directed towards him, yeah?<br>\n<br>\nI'm not done, either. Mind's just damned inquisitive right now and pulling at this string to see what unravels.", "time": "Sun Jun 15, 2014 8:21 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=57502&start=375", "forum": "53", "thread": "57502"}

It's a personal fault. I said RVS is a serious thing, when I should have said RVS meta is a serious thing.  Meta is a serious thing, and I've learned that RVS meta can be considered separate from game meta, as can lylo, pressure, and L-1 meta. RVS meta is not my forte. I'm better at judging lylo, and pressure. IDGAF who takes RVS seriously, I do. Are you saying that I'm buddying up to Yankee? Is that a claim that he takes RVS seriously(strawman). Are you guys friends and you just know that? <br>\n-Oh My God You Suck. I don't don't see how I was using it incorrectly. OMGUS is usually used for voting someone who votes you.

Your last sentence also bothers me \"...and consider you on the block if he flips town.\" It seems to me you're giving yourself convenient options for a vote down the line if a Slandarr lynch were to occur.</div></blockquote>\n\nRVS is a serious thing, I admire the skill of other players who use it as a scum hunting tool. My initial PoE is that Bacde was using it to OMGUS and then asking that I totally trust him. The only thing I feel like I can be sure of right now is that Bacde is not on the scum team with Slandar.<br>\nThe meta that Bacde provided seems legit if it wasn't so old and out of date, but I'm going to be looking for partners so I moved my vote off for now.</div></blockquote>\nmy reaction here was 1st of all to a statement, RVS is a serious thing. That is plain straight hyperbole.  Then it is buddying up to those that do take RVS serious. Then he is trying talk like he knows what he is taking about, throwing out a misuses of OMGUS and then qualifying his statement by saying oh, I really don't know anything.   So, yup, chalk me up for having nebulous reasons for my response. Thanks for the inquiry Mir.

It's a personal fault. I said RVS is a serious thing, when I should have said RVS meta is a serious thing.  Meta is a serious thing, and I've learned that RVS meta can be considered separate from game meta, as can lylo, pressure, and L-1 meta. RVS meta is not my forte. I'm better at judging lylo, and pressure. IDGAF who takes RVS seriously, I do. Are you saying that I'm buddying up to Yankee? Is that a claim that he takes RVS seriously(strawman). Are you guys friends and you just know that? <br>\n-Oh My God You Suck. I don't don't see how I was using it incorrectly. OMGUS is usually used for voting someone who votes you. In which case it still applies because Slandaar got the hammer on Bacde. Even if you didn't understand that point, I thought that the people that I was talking about would understand it. <br>\n-Ad Hom- \"You haven't shown jack shit\" is an attack on me, and not responding to the question that I asked you. Why do I feel like you are yelling at me?<br>\n-Over qualified statements? I don't understand, are you calling me scum for that? I can't explain my personality. <br>\n-Please give me more direct questions. I like these. But, I don't always respond directly to the player asking me. Sometimes I answer multiple people in the same post, and hope that everyone reads it. <br>\n-Let me ISO myself. I've been a lot busier than I expected the past few days, and I may have had to leave in the middle of writing posts a couple of times. i.e. lost posts.</div></blockquote>\nyou cannot OMGUS someone for an action in a past game. That is a revenge vote action, not OMGUS.  OMGUS is simply reacting to someone because in the current game they are pushing you.

I cannot explain your perception of my response.

But this still then goes back to the idea of shouldn't we then not lynch him though on the first day and see what happens? Because if he is claiming vig and we don't lynch him and there's no evidence of vig actions in the second day then Slandaar's claim would be proven false and combined with the first day actions would prove to be scum.

You'll notice I used to constantly point out the ways in which you were so marvellously wrong and hope you would change it, but I've stopped doing it because I've concluded you're genuinely that shit. <br>\n<br>\nI mean the experience I've been having when you're playing with me is beyond fucking horrible. You always start off by using Random.org to vote which completely makes RVS redundant and allows scum to hide behind -correctly- accusing you. You openly commit scumtells/badtells and explain them away with rubbish like \"My home site is not mafiascum, therefore I may do whatever retarded action I like and it's cool, guys!\" or  some other bull like \"OMGUS is null! Null, not scum! I can do it!\". No, you can't, because OMGUS is BAD. A lot of the guys in this game I like; Bacde's a cool guy, I've enjoyed seeing reinoe mature from the Newbie game I played with him, Titus is always interesting, but if I were in possession of a daykill, I would have nuked you upon sight, because you're literally the definition of anti-town. When you post, it's either fluffy bullshit or bullshit vaguely resembling incoherent content. When you post, that is, because as well as being bad, you're also a lurksack.<br>\n<br>\nI actually tried to be nice about it, I concluded not everyone is in full command of their mental faculties and, hey, we can't all be Empire/chamber/Tierce/Thor/Nacho, whatever. But after I made the effort to start being nice, and not point out the glaring play flaws you exhibit like you're proud of them, then you call me bad? This isn't pot-kettle, this is like Hitler calling mith a dictator. It's deranged. I mean, even your fucking NAME. It's like a toddler won a \"Design-A-Name\" contest for your username.<br>\n<br>\nPlease. Do not talk to me again. Do not try to interact with me, because this has been building up and you have no idea how batshit your \"play\", if you could call it play, annoys me.<br>\n<br>\n[/rantover]", "time": "Tue Jun 17, 2014 7:08 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=57502&start=575", "forum": "53", "thread": "57502"}

Null, not scum! I can do it!\". No, you can't, because OMGUS is BAD.

You have a mindset of a certain set of behaviors. You attack anyone who waivers from your preconceived ideas and expectations. Ad Hominem attacks become the central core of the engagement. It reinforces group think and gets reinforced by the times when someone actually does not match up to your behavior checklist.  It does very little to really find town or scum and simply sets up reasons to run someone up, get a flip and make adjustments.  So, no I do not cater to attempts to bully me into a line of reasoning which has no merit or basis. Now admittedly, I get way more aggressive around here because of the sense of some of the dynamics. You can say I lurk all I want, but I am active in games and always observing. I skim way more then I lurk.  Here is the thing, if reality was such that \"town\" always engaged in certain behaviors and scum did not then the game would be easy.  Human interactions are far more complex than that.  And I am not surprised at your anger TSO. It is predictable.  But, please do not call your engaging in passive aggressive shots being nice, it is not. Note that you exploded when I took a passive aggressive shot. I am sorry for doing so and predictably you exploded. My apologies.

I've been on the site since Feb, and this is the first time I've been in a game where I actually thought a vig was an actual possibility. Where I come from (debate.org) Vigilante is almost always a TP role, or a fake scum claim. In a 12 player game like this, a town vig would sway the game heavily in town's favor, and I just haven't seen that from MS.net.  From what I have seen, there's more likely to be a shit ton of VT's. Which actually makes slandaar's role claim seem like BS, so I'm not liking you defending him over it.<br>\n<br>\nBut if someone who has been here longer than me thinks Slandaar is a TOWN vig, and not a third party, or scum.

Now being done when no idea if there is a vig is odd.  Just doesn't really happen much and usually would work itself out if it was a fake claim.  The +EV for the move is limited and it is a high risk gambit.  Now I have seen it for serial killer.  Where I come from there is a limited \"low flyer\" \"Lurker\" specific vigs and seen SK's claim that but usually not a team scum.

I suspected at the time that she was trying to fly under the radar, nothing she's done since then has made me think she intends to do otherwise.  I've seen no indication she's actually trying to find scum, and the reason I don't like her push on reinoe is because I feel she's using it to avoid commenting on the rest of the town again.<br>\n<br>\nWake - Initial case on unintentional manipulation was malarkey, I still think he was only pushing it to see who would bite.  He's been playing the apathy card pretty hard and has used it to avoid taking any hard stances on pretty much anyone.<br>\n<br>\nJosh B - Weakest scumread and the most in flux.  I still don't like his early play, I think he was deliberately avoiding a concrete answer to my question because he didn't have one.  May also have been lurking to avoid talking about it.  Conversely, since he claimed (and thus started posting more) I've found myself liking several of his posts and have a much better opinion of him.  The Doc claim also makes me pause.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nThe two players I suspect the least are almost certainly bacde and Chaoslord.<br>\n<br>\nI can't really think of anything on bacde other then the fact that he doesn't scumhunt nearly as much as his votecount suggests<br>\n<br>\nChaos is a lot easier.  He's lurked a lot more in the second half of the day, and I frankly don't really know where he stands on most of the players in town.  I get the impression he's playing it really safe.<br>\n<br>\nIronically enough Titus manages to be an honorable mention on both my scumreads AND my least suspected players.  I can't keep my opinion oh her steady, as she manages to say something to make it jump back and forth every other page.<br>\n<br>\nAs for the townblock, I don't really know where Titus was going with that.  Two players who think each other are town don't need some magical title to not vote for each other.  Personally I think the power of never having reinoe disagree with her is going to her head.<br>\n<br>\nAs for your last question, I've only played with Titus once before and I can't talk about it.", "time": "Thu Jun 19, 2014 3:51 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=57502&start=925", "forum": "53", "thread": "57502"}

Now I had already noticed that chaos is newbtown so I found this whole conversation boring and bizarre and I didn't want to step in it at all.  What's really interesting is that Wake then votes for Bacde in post 261.  Now you can call it whiteknighting or chainsaw defense or whatever but Bacde also recognized that chaos is newbtown and Wake's push could totally be scum motivated to keep someone off-balance hoping that they slip up.  This could be a particularly effective tactic if someone is newbtown.  Now we know that Bacde is conftown so his defense was completely town motivated.<br>\n<br>\n263 raises red flags though.  Defending someone and trying to get them to move on to important things that really matter is a very town motivated thing to do.  And then Wake just keeps on truckin' on this issue of \"unintentionally manipulating\".  The entire conversation is boring and I'm slogging through it all the same.  277 actually sounds town though.  But still he really does need to move the fuck on sweet jesus and he doesn't.

I was looking forwards to more of these types of posts but they never came...Since it was the only case he made of this type, I have to conclude that he was just going after low hanging fruit.  To re-iterate, it's not a bad case, but the fact that that's the only one he did a case on is suspect.

Scum choosing to lurk do it for strategic reasons--it's normally not a desire not to contribute, at least, not in that sense, as people seem to think.

This is a verifiable fact.  He was lurk-a-derping almost all of day one until Elyse started getting run up.  Then he pops up out of the woodwork and starts chainsaw defending her and trying to push for Titus.  Now this might have seemed townie at the time because he was defending whom he thought was a townread.  But if evilpacman was scum it wouldn't matter to him?  He could have just jumped on whichever wagon had less momentum and started pushing for another person.  This defines his entire D1 play.  He lurked, then he pushed for a wagon (if he knew both were town it didn't matter).<br>\n<br>\nRemember that reads list he created?  He couldn't even be bothered to send in a completed one.  Ridiculous.<br>\n<br>\nNow let's look at sns' play.  He lurks and says he's \"getting caught up with the game\", despite the fact that the night phase was delayed 24hrs specifically so that replacements could get caught up.  He makes 2 posts on day 2.

Which holy crap that's what sns is doing and it is infact null all on it's own!
