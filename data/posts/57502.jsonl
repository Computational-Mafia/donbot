All players, including the lynched player, may talk in twilight phase until I lock the topic.<br>5. All night actions must be sent in before the deadline, or they will not be counted. You may change your choice of action as much as you want, only your final choice will be counted.

Your vote is on chaoslord and it's a red-herring vote, so you're the last person to talk about \"bad votes\".  <br><br>2. How do you know I'm assuming he's town?  You see the part where several people are waiting on responses?  That's the proper thing to do.  I don't think Josh's post are so bad that he deserves to be at L-3: which I personally feel is a tipping point on a d-1 lynch.  You do see the part where I said \"at least he's trying\" right?  That doesn't mean I think he's town or scum it just means he's putting in effort.<br><br>3. I didn't like bacde's response.  You do realize people have differing opinions on things right?  You're being really presumptious and pushy too.  You're making all kinds of assumptions about other players.<br><br>4. Newbscum would put Josh at L-3, that previously mentioned tipping point.  The fact that chaoslord wanted to wait before putting down a vote suggests that he's not newbscum.<br><br>5.  And I don't care that Josh had three votes because he's \"earned\" those three votes.  His posting isn't great but I don't think he deserves to have a developing wagon: at least not before he clarifies a few things.<br><br>I'm fine with being asked questions but you make several leaps of logic in these questions.  The fact that bacde and I agree on chaoslord for independent reasons suggests that my vote on him may be a bad one.

His continued \"too easy\" OMGUSing is something I'd shy away from if I were scum. It seemed like he was trying to make a solid meta case on another player. Giving a year old game as a reason for voting someone is off balance, I recognized that immediately and was challenging him on it.

It is something a bit more substantial then the typical day 1, rvs, post RVS non-sense.  Now lets look at Josh's response that drew the vote, shall we.  HTH, TIA."}

To recap.<br><br>In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5950015#p5950015\">237</a> I mused at chaoslord's <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5943438#p5943438\">41</a>, in which he said it wasn't his intent to manipulate. Later in that post he said that if he came off as manipulative then that was not what he intended at all. The reason I questioned manipulation being unintentional... is that Psychological manipulation is a type of social influence that aims to change the perception or behavior of others through underhanded, deceptive, or even abusive tactics.<a href=\"https://www.google.com/#q=what+is+manipulation\" class=\"postlink\">*</a> When something is underhanded, deceptive, or even abusive, how is it not intentional? If someone's being unintentionally manipulative, it must mean that that person must be rather manipulative in general, right? <br><br>Oddly, bacde jumps in to defend chaoslord from my question. If the point of Mafia is to question players and gauge their reactions, why would a supposed Townie get in the way of it? I think he's mainly being combative and belligerent, as though he doesn't want me doing what I'm supposed to be doing. Only Scum has reason to obfuscate and hinder the information-gathering process. <br><br>What T S O said in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5950052#p5950052\">243</a> sums it up, basically. I have never heard of someone \"accidentally\" manipulating someone. Bacde's ardent defense of chaoslord being Town when we're only in Day 1 makes no sense, which makes me wonder what he's doing there, as well. Another thing of note is that in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5950055#p5950055\">245</a> bacde said CL (chaoslord) didn't admit to being manipulative, yet in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5943438#p5943438\">41</a> CL did say he didn't intend to manipulate, and later in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5950082#p5950082\">253</a> Mirhawk says CL confessed as soon as he called him on it. <br><br>Throughout this discussion bacde's tried to force me to say that I either think CL was being manipulative or isn't, when the actual issue was me questioning CL on whether it's even possible for manipulation to be unintentional. In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5950055#p5950055\">245</a> he starts trying to derail my inquiry onto something else. Townies son't derail inquiry. Scum does, though. He also assumes I don't have any reservations on other issues, either. I'm simply at the top of my list. There's a reason my analysis took a while.What also sounds like obfuscation is how bacde in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5950066#p5950066\">248</a> says that he got a kind \"fuck you\" from CL's <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5943438#p5943438\">41</a>. I didn't in the slightest, and I'd like an explanation from bacde on what specifically makes him get that feeling from CL's post.<br><br>Also note in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5950073#p5950073\">251</a> when I asked bacde how he got a kind \"fuck you\" from CL's post he never answered it[/post] in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5950076#p5950076\">252</a>. Whether that was deliberate or not I don't know, so I want answers. Mirhawk in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5950082#p5950082\">253</a> says it's perfectly possible to unintentionall manipulate people, yet I still haven't found any sort of credible source that says it's possible, or common. And if it is indeed very rare, why? And I do note the feeling that he's downplaying this by calling this curiosity of mine unimportant. Seeing as there's likely 3 scum we're dealing with, I'm more than a little conscious of claims over what is and isn't important. No one gets to decide what is and isn't important to question. Seeing that bacde at least twice requoted my posts before I had responded also makes me question what exactly he's doing, and why. <br><br>Yet again bacde, like an annoyed defense attorney/obfuscator, tries to get me to say whether I think CL was being manipulative or not, when that's what I'm trying to figure out: <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5950126#p5950126\">259</a>. Again in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5950132#p5950132\">260</a> he pesters by trying to get me to look elsewhere, while quipping that I haven't been reading the thread even though my first posts make it quite clear that I was. This kind of defense-attorney-like stuff is why I cast my vote against him in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5950136#p5950136\">261</a>. He then in the next post puts me in his Scumpile while not being specific as to why. Mirhawk then tries to define manipulation in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5950141#p5950141\">264</a>, even though, according to <a href=\"http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/manipulate\" class=\"postlink\">Oxford</a>, manipulation is either 1) handling or controlling (a tool, mechanism, etc.), typically in a skillful manner or 2) controlling or influencing (a person or situation) cleverly, unfairly, or unscrupulously. I do wonder about Mirhawk's latest posts up to that point.<br><br>Interestingly in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5950144#p5950144\">266</a> he then incorrectly says why I voted for him. I voted for bacde because he's being like a defense attorney, trying to shift my focus elsewhere, and taking my words out of context. I won't stop until my curiosity is satisfied, so when you get in the way of the flow of gathering information, to the point where I feel I'm being unsuccessfully manipulated, I'll not hesitate to cast my vote and gauge your next reactions. Funny how bacde thinks CL is Town when it's only Day 1, and how he says which issues are relevant and which aren't: <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5950147#p5950147\">267</a>. He's just awfully combative and defensive. How about you bacde let CL respond to the question directed towards him, yeah?<br><br>I'm not done, either. Mind's just damned inquisitive right now and pulling at this string to see what unravels."}

Sometimes someone can have a legit tell but more times then not it is people looking for something to pick at and doing so.  Anyone claiming to find scum on RVS is a bull-shitter. Now, once you gauge reactions to the bullshit then you start finding something worth pursuing. Now, once you got information out there and things start to flip then you can go back and take a look.  Get reactions, get votes, get someone runup, assess, rinse, repeat, and so on.  What I am used to on a day one is nothing but nonsense and shtick, until a random wagon forms usually on one form of bullshit or another, assess it, lynch or go another direction and so on."}

You'll notice I used to constantly point out the ways in which you were so marvellously wrong and hope you would change it, but I've stopped doing it because I've concluded you're genuinely that shit. <br><br>I mean the experience I've been having when you're playing with me is beyond fucking horrible. You always start off by using Random.org to vote which completely makes RVS redundant and allows scum to hide behind -correctly- accusing you. You openly commit scumtells/badtells and explain them away with rubbish like \"My home site is not mafiascum, therefore I may do whatever retarded action I like and it's cool, guys!\" or  some other bull like \"OMGUS is null! Null, not scum! I can do it!\". No, you can't, because OMGUS is BAD. A lot of the guys in this game I like; Bacde's a cool guy, I've enjoyed seeing reinoe mature from the Newbie game I played with him, Titus is always interesting, but if I were in possession of a daykill, I would have nuked you upon sight, because you're literally the definition of anti-town. When you post, it's either fluffy bullshit or bullshit vaguely resembling incoherent content. When you post, that is, because as well as being bad, you're also a lurksack.<br><br>I actually tried to be nice about it, I concluded not everyone is in full command of their mental faculties and, hey, we can't all be Empire/chamber/Tierce/Thor/Nacho, whatever. But after I made the effort to start being nice, and not point out the glaring play flaws you exhibit like you're proud of them, then you call me bad? This isn't pot-kettle, this is like Hitler calling mith a dictator. It's deranged. I mean, even your fucking NAME. It's like a toddler won a \"Design-A-Name\" contest for your username.<br><br>Please. Do not talk to me again. Do not try to interact with me, because this has been building up and you have no idea how batshit your \"play\", if you could call it play, annoys me.<br><br>[/rantover]"}

You always start off by using Random.org to vote which completely makes RVS redundant and allows scum to hide behind -correctly- accusing you. You openly commit scumtells/badtells and explain them away with rubbish like \"My home site is not mafiascum, therefore I may do whatever retarded action I like and it's cool, guys!\" or  some other bull like \"OMGUS is null! Null, not scum! I can do it!\". No, you can't, because OMGUS is BAD. A lot of the guys in this game I like; Bacde's a cool guy, I've enjoyed seeing reinoe mature from the Newbie game I played with him, Titus is always interesting, but if I were in possession of a daykill, I would have nuked you upon sight, because you're literally the definition of anti-town. When you post, it's either fluffy bullshit or bullshit vaguely resembling incoherent content. When you post, that is, because as well as being bad, you're also a lurksack.<br><br>I actually tried to be nice about it, I concluded not everyone is in full command of their mental faculties and, hey, we can't all be Empire/chamber/Tierce/Thor/Nacho, whatever. But after I made the effort to start being nice, and not point out the glaring play flaws you exhibit like you're proud of them, then you call me bad? This isn't pot-kettle, this is like Hitler calling mith a dictator. It's deranged. I mean, even your fucking NAME. It's like a toddler won a \"Design-A-Name\" contest for your username.<br><br>Please. Do not talk to me again. Do not try to interact with me, because this has been building up and you have no idea how batshit your \"play\", if you could call it play, annoys me.<br><br>[/rantover]</div></blockquote> Note, I don't give a fuck what you think. You put yourself out as an arrogant, know it all, piece of shit and I have yet to see you be right about anything.  You have your little cubby hole of categories which have really nothing to do with finding scum and everything to do with \"Group think\" and confirm bias.  I have flaws, you have flaws, we all have flaws. We do what we do. Now you claim you were nice this game but engage in petty nit picky nonsense and just clearly have a get ride of SKOT mindset.  OH, and dipshit, this name was always meant as sarcastic. You have not been nice to me one minute. I guess you call passive aggressive comments meant to belittle and your continual ad hominem attacks to be nice, hey, keep at it."}

You have a mindset of a certain set of behaviors. You attack anyone who waivers from your preconceived ideas and expectations. Ad Hominem attacks become the central core of the engagement. It reinforces group think and gets reinforced by the times when someone actually does not match up to your behavior checklist.  It does very little to really find town or scum and simply sets up reasons to run someone up, get a flip and make adjustments.  So, no I do not cater to attempts to bully me into a line of reasoning which has no merit or basis. Now admittedly, I get way more aggressive around here because of the sense of some of the dynamics. You can say I lurk all I want, but I am active in games and always observing. I skim way more then I lurk.  Here is the thing, if reality was such that \"town\" always engaged in certain behaviors and scum did not then the game would be easy.  Human interactions are far more complex than that.  And I am not surprised at your anger TSO. It is predictable.  But, please do not call your engaging in passive aggressive shots being nice, it is not. Note that you exploded when I took a passive aggressive shot. I am sorry for doing so and predictably you exploded. My apologies. Now can we get past this essential personality differences and differences in philosophy and find away to come together to eliminate scum? <br><br>I think there is likely to be scum on both run ups to claim."}

You have a defined set of behaviors. You seek to \"shape\" new players into following the set of behaviors. I have played at many different places other than home site. This is the only place that you will find the kind of reaction that you are describing, even with those from a \"mafia-centric\" learning of the game.  So you shape new players into the line of thinking until the get it.  Your last couple of sentences explain the core differences. Now I understand that you do not understand what I do. I know it bugs you. I am sorry, I cannot do differently than what I do.  Sure, there are things that I can learn, that can better me. It is not however, line up a set of behavioral expectations.  You claim that \"scum mindset\" only produces certain reactions. Now, there are certain things than can be indicative of being evasive and certain things not. Each person and individual is different.  Now as to working, take a good look back at who you push based on said mindset. You will find a lot of mislynch and occasional flipping over scum. Now, that is going to be true as to any technique as people are not static nor as predictable as you would think and a lot of variable reinforcement does occur."}

I've been on the site since Feb, and this is the first time I've been in a game where I actually thought a vig was an actual possibility. Where I come from (debate.org) Vigilante is almost always a TP role, or a fake scum claim. In a 12 player game like this, a town vig would sway the game heavily in town's favor, and I just haven't seen that from MS.net.  From what I have seen, there's more likely to be a shit ton of VT's.

Now being done when no idea if there is a vig is odd.  Just doesn't really happen much and usually would work itself out if it was a fake claim.  The +EV for the move is limited and it is a high risk gambit.  Now I have seen it for serial killer.  Where I come from there is a limited \"low flyer\" \"Lurker\" specific vigs and seen SK's claim that but usually not a team scum. In fact I cannot think of really any times that was tried."}

Then provide your thoughts on what you feel not only about each post, but on all of them put together. You can't give a detailed read of pacman right now? Bull. Sure you can. Whether you're right or wrong, give it a shot. If I can do it, and I'm barely ever on here, you certainly can do so. And as for your second part to my 2nd question, what do you make of these fellows who are voting me and declaring one way or another what my alignment is?

On #3, you certainly CAN prepare to ask questions. I'm not going to go berserk and start firing off a bunch of questions when they may have already been answered. Why do you think I kept rereading the game thread? Not just to find good questions, but to avoid asking questions that were already answered. Do you think it is good play to ask questions that have already been answered by others? Why Elyse and Chaos? Elyse has primarily been ignoring my posts, so I'm not sure what my guts reads on her are.<br><br>As for #4, people assume chaoslord is new. He could very well be a legit, alternate account of an experienced player. I've read that \"conscious, stream of thought\" posts are indicative of being a Townie.

What do you think?</div></blockquote><br><br>Oh finally. Now we see this.<br><br>What happened... let's see here. First, two of my scumreads are likely PRs meaning my reads were shit. Second, you were behaving like obvtown and then lurked out.<br><br>I can't. No one can. I have concerns I hit upon when I first came in. Anyone who says Pacman is scum or town for certain is probably wrong or doing PoE.<br><br>Elyse, Chaos, You (no one needs to \"prepare to ask questions\")<br><br>*shrug* That post could be an apologetic player or could be scum. I'd interpret it as scum because I'm scumreading Chaos.</div></blockquote><br><br>Also, what do you think of these sudden silly votes on me?<br><br>The reason I don't take anything seriously Day 1 when it comes to calling people Town or Scum is precisely why in your first answer here. As for \"lurking out,\" I'm hosting a rather large game elsewhere with 14 contentious newbies, as well as having work and, well, a life. Just a tad busy.<br><br>As for #2, why can't you provide a detailed read of evilpacman's posts? Look at his posts like I did. Read them as I read them. Then provide your thoughts on what you feel not only about each post, but on all of them put together. You can't give a detailed read of pacman right now? Bull. Sure you can. Whether you're right or wrong, give it a shot. If I can do it, and I'm barely ever on here, you certainly can do so. And as for your second part to my 2nd question, what do you make of these fellows who are voting me and declaring one way or another what my alignment is? Do you not also think they're probably wrong? I'm just curious, and I do get tired when I meet wayward resistance during the Scumhunting process.<br><br>WAIT A MINUTE. On #3, you certainly CAN prepare to ask questions. I'm not going to go berserk and start firing off a bunch of questions when they may have already been answered. Why do you think I kept rereading the game thread? Not just to find good questions, but to avoid asking questions that were already answered. Do you think it is good play to ask questions that have already been answered by others? Why Elyse and Chaos? Elyse has primarily been ignoring my posts, so I'm not sure what my guts reads on her are.<br><br>As for #4, people assume chaoslord is new. He could very well be a legit, alternate account of an experienced player. I've read that \"conscious, stream of thought\" posts are indicative of being a Townie. His post, #73, had an extremely long sentence in it. Does it not make you wonder that it may have been intentional? Maybe I'm paranoid, or just too curious for my own good, but I do have reservations about CL.</div></blockquote><br><br><br>1) Now, you weren't there at the time shit went down. I'm not claiming strategic lurking or lurkaderp but you weren't there. Period.<br><br>2) I can't provide analysis of contentless posts. I could take apart his readwall a bit but it's mostly just conclusions.<br><br>3) No one \"prepares to ask questions\" in forum mafia. You clarify them by asking them. Sometimes it is good to repeat a question if you didn't understand the answer.<br><br>4) Stream of consciousness is not indicative of alignment. It's more indicative of impulsivity. I do stream of consciousness as either alignment. Wow... a long sentence as a towntell... you are giving Elyse a run for her money."}

I cannot change who I am because others do not understand me. And why would I assume anything about your behavior as this is 1st game in together.

I have no idea where you were, just the lack of engagement as you read through your ISO after making a proclamation of pulling a thread and going to no where.

In one sense, I can see his frustration coming from trying to protect the fact that he was trying to soft claim. But it seemed really awkward that he didn't want to take a stand on Pacman. The way Titus, and SKOT were interacting with him feels like two towns trying to get a read on a slot, not pressuring for the lynch. I threw my vote in because Wake's actions seemed to be frustration for no reason, or rather overly mad that he was caught for bad reasons.

I suspected at the time that she was trying to fly under the radar, nothing she's done since then has made me think she intends to do otherwise.  I've seen no indication she's actually trying to find scum, and the reason I don't like her push on reinoe is because I feel she's using it to avoid commenting on the rest of the town again.<br><br>Wake - Initial case on unintentional manipulation was malarkey, I still think he was only pushing it to see who would bite.  He's been playing the apathy card pretty hard and has used it to avoid taking any hard stances on pretty much anyone.<br><br>Josh B - Weakest scumread and the most in flux.  I still don't like his early play, I think he was deliberately avoiding a concrete answer to my question because he didn't have one.  May also have been lurking to avoid talking about it.  Conversely, since he claimed (and thus started posting more) I've found myself liking several of his posts and have a much better opinion of him.  The Doc claim also makes me pause.<br><br><br>The two players I suspect the least are almost certainly bacde and Chaoslord.<br><br>I can't really think of anything on bacde other then the fact that he doesn't scumhunt nearly as much as his votecount suggests<br><br>Chaos is a lot easier.  He's lurked a lot more in the second half of the day, and I frankly don't really know where he stands on most of the players in town.  I get the impression he's playing it really safe.<br><br>Ironically enough Titus manages to be an honorable mention on both my scumreads AND my least suspected players.  I can't keep my opinion oh her steady, as she manages to say something to make it jump back and forth every other page.<br><br>As for the townblock, I don't really know where Titus was going with that.  Two players who think each other are town don't need some magical title to not vote for each other.  Personally I think the power of never having reinoe disagree with her is going to her head.<br><br>As for your last question, I've only played with Titus once before and I can't talk about it."}

I'm checking my ISO before I start complaining that I already said stuff and no one is listening to me. Mirhawk, has created and left two cases open for others to press. In one case, he went after Wake for pressing the manipulation issue on chaos, that he started in RVS. In the other case, He left SKOT to question me on a case that he said he has against me for not answering his question. I'm pretty sure that I answered all of the questions SKOT asked me, which included the answer to his question. I'd rather see someone re ask a question, if they are genuine, then to just arbitrarily claim that someone isn't answering questions. <br><br>About Elyse, the AtE in 1511 is good.

Where Elyse on the other hand had been close to L-1 for a while. If she was it, wouldn't she have reset it earlier? I think this all points towards the fact that Titus has been being quite scummy for a while now"}

When he starts wondering about Chaoslord's \"unintentional manipulation\".  Now I had already noticed that chaos is newbtown so I found this whole conversation boring and bizarre and I didn't want to step in it at all.  What's really interesting is that Wake then votes for Bacde in post 261.  Now you can call it whiteknighting or chainsaw defense or whatever but Bacde also recognized that chaos is newbtown and Wake's push could totally be scum motivated to keep someone off-balance hoping that they slip up.  This could be a particularly effective tactic if someone is newbtown.  Now we know that Bacde is conftown so his defense was completely town motivated.<br><br>263 raises red flags though.  Defending someone and trying to get them to move on to important things that really matter is a very town motivated thing to do.  And then Wake just keeps on truckin' on this issue of \"unintentionally manipulating\".  The entire conversation is boring and I'm slogging through it all the same.  277 actually sounds town though.  But still he really does need to move the fuck on sweet jesus and he doesn't.

I was looking forwards to more of these types of posts but they never came...Since it was the only case he made of this type, I have to conclude that he was just going after low hanging fruit.  To re-iterate, it's not a bad case, but the fact that that's the only one he did a case on is suspect.

Scum choosing to lurk do it for strategic reasons--it's normally not a desire not to contribute, at least, not in that sense, as people seem to think. True scum lurking is basically reading what's going on (generally done offline), seeing how things develop, and then, having seen them develop, posting in a manner to divide rifts between towns. This type of lurking, as it is clearly meant to achieve a goal, is often able to be read.</div></blockquote><br>That's from Mastin, of Mastin MD fame.<br><br>Let's look at the evilpacman/sns slot.<br><br>Evilpacman was posting in other areas of the forum and not posting in the game.  This is a verifiable fact.  He was lurk-a-derping almost all of day one until Elyse started getting run up.  Then he pops up out of the woodwork and starts chainsaw defending her and trying to push for Titus.  Now this might have seemed townie at the time because he was defending whom he thought was a townread.  But if evilpacman was scum it wouldn't matter to him?  He could have just jumped on whichever wagon had less momentum and started pushing for another person.  This defines his entire D1 play.  He lurked, then he pushed for a wagon (if he knew both were town it didn't matter).<br><br>Remember that reads list he created?  He couldn't even be bothered to send in a completed one.  Ridiculous.<br><br>Now let's look at sns' play.  He lurks and says he's \"getting caught up with the game\", despite the fact that the night phase was delayed 24hrs specifically so that replacements could get caught up.  He makes 2 posts on day 2.  He has three posts on day 3.<br><br><!-- l --><a class=\"postlink-local\" href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5955353#p5955353\">viewtopic.php?p=5955353#p5955353</a><!-- l --><br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>edit: also (as llama already touched on), scum tend to lurk through critical points.</div></blockquote><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5983380#p5983380\" class=\"postlink\">post 1446</a>, snscompt1 wrote:</cite>Will catch up tonight.

Which holy crap that's what sns is doing and it is infact null all on it's own!

Ok well I recall Titus calling you town and then you immediately got suspicious of her and started voting to get her lynched.  Also Titus was town.  If you don't believe me say so and I'll provide links.  No I don't think defending you should be rewarded but I would at least like it if you would say \"hmm what is the town motivation for this person trying to prevent my lynch?  What is the scum motivation for this person trying to prevent my lynch?

As a town doctor getting roleblocked, scum had three options, NK me, and block SKOT. Kill Boonskies, and Block SKOT, or Kill SKOT and block me. Leaving the DayVig alive could have been dangerous for scum with a real role blocker. I really played on the idea that a claimed DR is worthless.  Reinoe really wanted to NK Slandaar on N1. I'm glad we didn't because Bacade's death made TSO think that ChaosLord was town. If reinoe and I led the lynch on ChaosLord, with (Boonskies, and Wake) Mirhawk, and TSO would have been the remaining SCUM. We had a big plan to take out Titus, but Slandaar ruined it, and we didn't really have as much of a plan for this DP. But we were going to go after SNS and Mirhawk.  I fake claimed Doc because I thought there would be a Counter Claim.

I have now discredited you as it was obvious from the first post you were just complaining about the setup as you are mad you lost and want to blame something/someone."}
