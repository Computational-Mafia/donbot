This is a game. Have fun. Don't let things get personal.<br>\n<br>\n2. During Day, you may vote for the player you want to lynch. Votes should be in the form <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: Player</div> or they may not be counted. It is helpful to \"<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Unvote</div>\" when switching your vote to a different player, though this is not required.<br>\n<br>\n3. Whenever a player has a majority in votes, that player will be lynched, his or her role will be revealed, and Night will begin. Once a player has reached a majority, Twilight will begin. No votes or unvotes will be registered, although talking may continue until the thread is locked. You may also <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: No Lynch</div>; a majority will end Day without a death.<br>\n<br>\n4. If discussion lags or Day goes on for too long, a deadline may be set. If no one has reached a majority at the deadline, the person with the most votes will be lynched.<br>\n<br>\n5. During Night, players with role abilities may send targets for those abilities. Choices are due by the posted deadline, but day may start earlier if the choices are sent in early.<br>\n<br>\n6. Don't edit/delete posts. Use the \"Preview\" button to look over your post before you submit it.<br>\n<br>\n7. Don't quote any PMs from the Moderator.<br>\n<br>\n8. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Mafia, werewolves, masons etc. are allowed to communicate by PM/QT at all times</div> (i.e. not just during the night phase). Otherwise, do not talk to anyone about this game outside the thread.<br>\n<br>\n9. When you are killed you may make one final post (as long as it is simply an \"oh well\" type post that doesn't reveal any game information), but then you are dead. Do not talk until the game is over; this includes talking to living players outside the thread.<br>\n<br>\n10. I will send out prods at my discretion/on request. Players may be replaced if a prod is not responded to.<br>\n<br>\n11. No attempting to break the game with cryptography or invisible text etc.<br>\n<br>\n12. If you have any question, complaint, or comment, PM the Moderator.<br>\n<br>\n13.

{"number": 155, "id": "2975768", "user": "Slaxx", "user_id": "12782", "content": "Akira, she is just usually way more adamant about giving her opinion on things. Like, she enjoys expressing herself in games. A lot. I'm getting kind of a locked up vibe from her this game. And indeed, and I was also waiting to see your rebuttal to my case (I assumed you would make one). And thats pretty much it. Now for reads that I have put off a little too long.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"> Akira: </div> Slight Town. I get the feel by the questions he has directed ask me he is almost trying to see my towniness as opposed to just wanting to lynch me. I get a decent town read off of that. But his initial play still just bugs me. Definitely someone I could see being town as the game moves on.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Akira, what are YOUR thoughts on Jess? What do you think of the people who were on your bandwagon? Are you getting any solid towntells off of anyone?</div><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"> Dazzy: </div> Scum (but not with Duplicity). He held his RVS on what I thought to be a fairly obvious townie, then unvoted and has not pressured anyone since but continues to defend himself. Says he isn't a fan of the Akira wagon but doesn't exactly offer up any alternatives. Not a good start for sure. When asked for FoSs he just throws together the general consensus of everyone else's without offering new content. However, Duplicity's case on him is incredibly misguided. Way too nitpicky. They aren't both scum, this I'm pretty sure of.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Dazzy, explain why you FoSed the people you did.</div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"> Duplicity: </div> Scum (but not with Dazzy). Although his initial methodology gave me a town read on him, I really am not liking his most recent posts, especially his interactions with Dazzy. Secondly, the second half of the hydra head came in and decided to vote a null player for pressure. That's good because its exactly what I did with Jess, but he pretty much ignored everything else that was going on, once again naming FoSs that everyone else had already brought up. Althoug I love the Silavor FoS (I will get to that in a bit).<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"> E_Lou: </div> Slight Town. Needs more content, but nothing I have seen so far rings as scummy. I like how he calls out Grey for lack of content. He needs more than just a Scumhunter scumread though or my opinion of him may quickly turn around. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"> Greymarble: </div> Neutral. Needs more content and explanation of reads. I like where he is coming from with the Quilf FoS but idk if I agree. I'm getting slight gut town vibes from Quil.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\"> Greymarble, I will tell you how I feel about Pine in this very post! How do you feel about Duplicity and his case on Dazzy?</div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"> Ion: </div> Slight Scum (but not with Duplicity). Needs more content from his posts. Duplicity's catch on the wiki article is decent, but I'm not fully sold yet. I like the way he criticized Duplicity's case but didn't jump on it, it means they probably aren't partners. I don't like how conservative he is with his vote and how he seems to be a little concerned about people who FoS him. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Jess: </div> Neutral. for the love of god I cannot read her. I cannot tell if she is legitimately bored with the game already or if she is trying to shy away from the wrath that is my scumhunting. I like how she gave a read without being prompted (the Ion=slight town) but 1. I don't agree with that tell and 2. it is the only tell I haven't had to extract from her. More pressure on Jess probably won't be a bad thing.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"> Nintendo: </div> Town. His very first post was a towntell. His other posts haven't rang scum. This read is malleable but I won't drop it easy. Maybe I just want to believe it because I am having a difficult time pulling town tells out of this game, but hey, we all need something to believe in. He needs to focus on someone other than scumhunter though. I think I saw some Dazzy hate in his posts (I can dig that) so he gets brownie points there.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"> Pine: </div> Neutral. I like the Akira vote, but he has since tunneled on Scumhunter. Needs more reads and more content. I need to check out Pine town because I have only seen Pine scum and idk why but I feel like I'm going to have to use meta on him. I know when I first saw his play as scum in the game I modded I felt like he was getting lynched not because he was scummy but because of his playstyle and he just happened to be scum. Anyway I am probably going to go stalk his town games when I have some free time.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"> Quil: </div> Slight Scum. I don't like the early mudflinging on nintendo or the sheeping on Akira or the scumhunter vote. I said earlier I had a gut town read on Quil but after looking at her Iso...yeah, I get where you whoever I said that to is coming from.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\"> Quil, care to explain your town reads? </div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"> Scumhunter: </div> Gut town. He's way more competent than he appears, and I feel like if he was scum he would have started appeasing the town by outting some read by now. I'm not a huge fan of the people pressuring him (except maybe nintendo, who I still think is midsguided newbie town), so that helps his case too.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\"> Hi old friend, can you please out some reads now &gt;.&gt;</div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"> Silavor: </div> Scum.

My issue earlier was simply his lack of any content and being difficult.<br>\n<br>\nQuilford - Mainly got a scummy read on him for the Akira sheep. Then he still didn't justfiy himself when asked about it. Now that Scumhunter is under pressure, he's gone and sheeped again, reinforcing my earlier read.

Stronger scum-read than before.<br>\n<br>\nIon - Was mostly gut at the time, I agreed with a couple of small points made by others and that was my way of expressing it. For now he's a null for me, I can't see any big issues with his posts.<br>\n<br>\nPine - Again, mostly just a feeling. He was giving opinions and doing something while encouraging people to back up their votes. I'm not perfectly comfortable with his last couple of actions (Akira unvote and Scumhunter vote), mainly because I'm not seeing SH being scum, and think the wagon is a bad idea at this point, and so his read regresses to null with light town for now.<br>\n<br>\nHopefully this is satisfactory.<br>\n<br>\nNow: New stuff.<br>\n<br>\nI'd really like GreyMarble to back up his vote on Pine.

It was more of a joke omgus vote on him. I took that time to unvote because I don't like to have a vote on so early on day one, let alone when there are a few votes on the person. I don't like the RVS stage, and I generally try to withhold my vote if I can. As for appearance vs. action, this goes with my previous sentence. I don't like to vote willy-nilly just because I can.

If you really think someone is scum, it's hard to justify a vote hop from them to another townie.  If your vote is weak, then it's very easy to.  And it can always solidify.

I am in a bunch of games right now and am usually active. I went meh early on in this game when I made one post and Pine was like \"Case. Now.\" I didn't really want to deal with the needless intensity at that point so I decided I was going to focus my energy on other games and let things play out for a while. Seeing as I am town, you should probably start looking for other foses though. Verdict: Null <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">nintendoaddict1</div>: Ha. I am not saying there is no reason to scumhunt day 1. What I was saying is actually very similar to what you have been saying so far this game, in that in a day start game with 13 people (and probably 4 mafia) how serious can we take these minute reads that we supposedly have on people?

But when you said \"I don't understand anything nintendo is saying...\" Why not just ask him specifically about what you don't understand? Also it always raises a red flag to me when someone says. \"It seems a bit like...\" or something to that effect. It shows an unwillingness to ruffle feathers and have an opinion. That type of apologetic scumhunting is often mafia tactics in my experience. Verdict: Leaning Scum<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Jessa</div>: What is wrong with pulling metagame in? It is a legitimate strategy. Anything in the world that is competitive involves metagame. Sports, warfare, political debates all use metagame. Only mafia wouldn't want town to use everything at its disposal to rid the world of scum. Another thing I have noticed is that all of the reads you have posted you have also posted some sort of justification/excuse for. As town (to use metagame  <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\"> ) you tend to be more proactive, but then again so do I.

Apparently I need to be more black and white with my reads for you? As for unvoting Slaxx, I unvoted him because the original vote wasn't even a real RVS vote. It was more of a joke omgus vote on him. I took that time to unvote because I don't like to have a vote on so early on day one, let alone when there are a few votes on the person. I don't like the RVS stage, and I generally try to withhold my vote if I can. As for appearance vs. action, this goes with my previous sentence. I don't like to vote willy-nilly just because I can.

If I have no reasoning behind my gut feeling other than gut, I'm not putting a vote on it. That's just stupid and illogical. Like I've said a few times, I don't like to put on my vote in forum mafia unless I'm sure. I'm still not completely used to the voting process on forum mafia, and I don't like having to babysit my vote.<br>\nAs for E_Lou, I think it wasn't exactly a denial of the contradiction occuring, just that you read into it too much. I think it was merely a contradiction of phrasing and not a scumslip, but the fact that Dazzy did get riled up about it is odd. <br>\nAlso I really need to take my meta and remove it because I am just getting really frustrated with you lmao. I don't think before I type a lot (as you know) and so this is a lot to deal with for me. As for my read on Ion, I'll have to look more into it. Honestly at this point I forget why I even said he was potentially town. TO ME, I think pushing back on a strong-headed pushy player to be town ish to me in a way. Hard to explain I guess. And he did have a choice to not respond in the discussion. A few people didn't really respond in it or if they did it wasn't in great length.

Lost my net access last night while typing up a post, locking me out and losing my post in the process.<br>\n<br>\nBeing home has been a lot more hectic than I was expecting, realistically I should have put in a V/LA, I apologise.<br>\n<br>\nSome reads:<br>\n<br>\nLooking again at Silavor, I find myself seeing him as a possible lynch candidate. His ISO consists of questioning Duplicity's end-of-post reads, voting Scumhunter quite early with one sentence of justification (which is fine for me because it WAS early), pushing ScumHunter for reads, and then voting Ion for being inactive.<br>\n<br>\nHe refused to give his input in regards to Duplicity's reads (the end-of-post thing), but never gave a reason for why he didn't want to. He voted early and left his vote there while a wagon built, without reinforcing it except for once. And in that one follow-up against SH, all he says is:\n<blockquote><div><cite>silavor wrote:</cite> <br>\n...<br>\nWe're not asking for Mastin-sized cases here, just your opinions on what's happend, and what you think is scummy.<br>\n...\n</div></blockquote>\n\nWhat I find interesting is that while Silavor is asking for cases and pressuring people he doesn't think are contributing, he's not taking any solid stances himself, or putting himself out there. He'll \"provide reads if he's asked for them\", but jumps on others for not sharing?

I need a bit more time to analyze how this situation will continue.<br>\n<br>\nSH... Initially I didn't think scum would play like he has been, and posting his reads helped, but looking back on them, they are almost all extremely shallow. Obviously it's difficult to get some surefire reads going on D1, but when relating this post to his others, you can see that most of it is like the rest of his input - fluff meant to distract from a lack of actual content. His follow-up also stands out - he's clamoring for attention, trying to make us all see how pro-town he is by posting his reads. Still not sure on him, but definitely increased suspicion. Meh.

Since you know your meta and know what towntells you're dropping, it seems easy enough to fake.  You know what's not easy to fake?  Interactions.  I have rarely seen scum who can 'naturally' scumhunt a buddy.  Scum can scumhunt town (although it's a bit of a knack) but it is HARD to do the 'question and answer when you feel out your partner's alignment' when you <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">both</div> know your partner's alignment.  Neither has any curiousity, but both of you have to fake it?  Sure friggin Reckoner and SpyreX could probably do the dance, but SpyreX and, say, Baby Spice ( a decent scum player, but by no means exceptional)? No.  BS would eventually drop the ball.  So get out and interact with other players.<br>\n<br>\n2) You're not really DOING anything.  It might not make you mafia, but given the choice of day 1 lynches, I'll choose someone who I'm 70% sure will flip town and is doing NOTHING over someone who is 50% likely to flip town and is doing lots (note: percentages courtesy of my ass).

Part of the job of scumhunting is reading people, and that includes reading whether a person's appeal to emotion is an actual appeal or a mafia ploy. The only reason people say \"aTe, stop it\" is because it is the hardest appeal to read as to whether its a towntell or a scumtell from the person.  A town tell from one person is a scumtell from another and vice versa.

Even if you're familiar to Night Start, you should realize by the morning you'll still have RVS. Unless the people you play with are idiots who try to reason who would kill X.

The object is to lynch mafia.

The only real reason he's scummy is because he didn't expect RVS, which makes no sense really and is more of a null tell than anything. Having no reason isn't really a scum tell, and being 3rd of 7 votes isn't that bad. AKA: Nintendo is looking to be some pretty good newb town at this point. <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Pine wrote:</cite>Ehhh...my vote on Akira no longer feels completely random.

Since this is Day start there is nothing to go on therefore who I vote for and why makes no difference.</div></blockquote>IC GODLYNESS TIME.<br>\n<br>\nNintendo. Stop depending on Power Roles. That isn't the only way to catch scum. In fact, Cops are stupid. They can go fuck themselves. Games that have all Vanilla Townies and Mafia Goons? Those are the sweet games. Vengeful Townies are fun too, but they're on par. <br>\n<br>\nHere's the point. If you want to play games well on Mafiascum, and do your wincon some good, you should try to find your scum and stop relying on everyone else.<br>\n<br>\nThe point of RVS is for reactions. You're supposed to get bad reactions in order to get scum. Once you get this bad reaction, you are able to bandwagon on the plausible scum and see how they react, maybe get a claim. There is a point, you just haven't thought that far yet, unfortunately.<br>\n<br>\nWhy hasn't Dazzy, after looking at #53, realized that Nintendo is an ultra-newbie and is probably not scum? Hmmzorz.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Nintendo wrote:</cite>If lynching people for no reason is not pro-town, then why are you even voting in the first place? There is no way to know what role or alignment a person has at this point.</div></blockquote>I think you have to realize that there's a huge difference between voting and lynching.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Nintendo wrote:</cite>And how is that a random accusation? You are voting for me simply because I have played mafia on another site? That was not random at all. And if that is your only reason for voting me then it is moot.</div></blockquote>Makes you kind of think why Nintendo thinks his vote is good, and if he's possibly faking. It'd be a good reveal, but probably not. I will admit that Dazzzy did find a bad reaction of Nintendo, but meh.<br>\n<br>\nLet's let him pass for now?

Sound fair? <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Akira wrote:</cite>3) I'm intentionally overstating my case for pressure, okay? It's the best you can do on D1.</div></blockquote>Ha.

That's good bullshit. Restating something without having any break is like telling someone to do something twice. Does it get them to do it faster? No, it just annoys them.</div></blockquote><br>\nActually no. Pressuring causes reactions. Wether it's a scumslip or just getting annoyed, it's still a reaction, and reactions are good.<br>\nBesides in a way if I hadn't done it then there wouldn't have been a wagon on me and we probably wouldn't have this much content by now. <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\"> <br>\nAnd the whole vote justification problem was completely new to me.

I won't go so far as to say that he's scum, but I really don't get how he's obvtown in anyone's mind.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Scumhunter</div> - Lots of contentless posts. Sucks up to people and apologizes for looking scummy. He should care about finding scum, not about looking good.

If anything, Scumhunter is the newbie for having not played forum mafia before at all. At least, that was my impression based on the back-and-forth between Scumhunter, Slaxx and Jessa. Either way, both Scumhunter and Nintendo are new to Mafiascum, so what <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">exactly </div>is your point?

Like Slaxx pointed out, you're defending nintendo using the same logic used to attack scumhunter, and that awful WIFOM excuse of scumhunter and I being scum doesn't hold water. I wasn't the only one thinking scumhunter couldn't be scum, I was just the first to add in scum daytalk evidence. You also have basically the entire town listed as null/leaning scum. Way to take a stance on things. Wait, isn't that one of the things that makes me your \"top suspect?\" Lolirony is lol. You say greymarble's \"not as obvtown as everyone seems to be assuming,\" but give no evidence to why our reads on him are wrong. In other words, <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">WAY TO TAKE A STANCE ON THINGS.</div> What's worse is you don't even think Greymarble's scum, you just don't like us having a solid town read on him. As for your bit about scumhunter, go back and actually <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">read </div>the thread. Scumhunter says the line you \"really don't like\" in post <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2995976#p2995976\" class=\"postlink\">347</a>, but pine doesn't unvote until <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2997621#p2997621\" class=\"postlink\">356</a>.

If all else fails, if your partner's taking heat from posting too many joke posts, you can at least tell him to shut up and lay low for a bit, until the heat wears off.

The other one will end up on the Ion67 vig pool and there's been enough friction between the two of them that lynching one could give us enough information about the other to tell us if they should be lynched tomorrow should one of the two (Pine and silavor) survive the night.", "time": "Sun May 08, 2011 4:31 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=17230&start=650", "forum": "53", "thread": "17230"}

However, that contradicts my read on scumhunter from basically the entire game, and I'm not quite ready to believe that just yet.

He claims it's because no one produced a viable case against me, but if that were true why didn't he just vote pine, or at least explain why he believed pine wasn't scum?

I don't like the thought of Elouscum, but it wouldn't be the first time a townie tone that rarely posts manages to pull the wool over my eyes. Slaxx's reasoning for protecting empking is the same reason I protected him, and is probably the same reason the last scum tried to kill him; he was the only truly confirmed town at that point, and if I recall correctly he hadn't claimed at that point, so Empking was basically a confirmed town with a totally unknown power. <br>\n<br>\nAs for Nintendo, that's an obvious kill as well; he had a reusable power in a game of one-shots. Even though we probably would have mislynched him today, Nintendo could claim who he tracked last night so once he did die we'd take his final track seriously. Who would have been Nintendo's final track? It probably would have been Elou or Slaxx, and it would have won us the game, because even if the track didn't show anything it would've meant the other was guilty then.

The quotes below will show my line of logic which I will clarify afterward:<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>ThAdmiral wrote:</cite>You wake up and find that no one is dead.<br>\n<br>\nIt is now Day 3. With 9 alive it is 5 to lynch.</div></blockquote>This night is the first (and thus far only) night with no kills.  <blockquote><div><cite>Scumhunter wrote:</cite>awesome. last night probably not a no kill.<br>\n<br>\nMafia was either roleblocked or we had a doc save.</div></blockquote><blockquote><div><cite>silavor on Day 3 wrote:</cite>claiming one-shot jailkeeper who protected Empking last night.</div></blockquote><blockquote><div><cite>Akira wrote:</cite>I'm a 1-shot tracker. I targeted Slaxx and he targeted Empking.</div></blockquote><blockquote><div><cite>Slaxx wrote:</cite>1-shot doc, take it or leave it. Protected Empking.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nHere is my logic stemming from Night 2.  If we assume all of those who I quoted above are telling the truth about their roleclaims (and we know Akira is,) then that severely limits our suspect list to gorilla (who I see as town), me (but I'm VT as I said before), Mogri (who could well be scum but I think he's town due to not being cc'd when he claimed oneshot vig who killed Ion), and Empking.  Empking comes under heavy suspicion from me because the one night that the town roleblocks him, there is no kill.  If there is only one scum left it would be stupid for them to not kill someone at night.  There is also the possibility that one of the people whom I quoted above lied about their roleclaim and are scum.  If that's the case, then the scum would be silavor (whom I clear on the grounds that his JK role apparently got us to the nokill night 2), Scumhunter (who could easily be lying about his cop result but I don't think he is), or Slaxx.  Slaxx could easily be lying about being a oneshot doc who protected Empking.  For all we know, he could have gone to Empking's house to kill him.<br>\n<br>\nThus, if everyone who I quoted above is telling the truth about their role, then Empking is my prime suspect.  If, however, someone is lying about their role I believe Slaxx to be the most likely liar because he only claimed oneshot doc after it was suggested that he could be doc by yours truly.  I'm not going to vote for either one yet because I don't feel like I have enough proof that either one is guilty.

{"number": 942, "id": "3057668", "user": "silavor", "user_id": "13303", "content": "You hand out various reads throughout day one, but with the exception of your \"Scumhunter is scum\" and your \"Pine is town\" reads, backpedal on all of them really quickly. You also try to break up the first town alliance that forms, with your only reasoning being that you misinterpreted Greymarble's hydra-ness as being scum contradicting itself. Then when you confess that you didn't know it was a hydra, you unvote your <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Scumhunter</div> vote, to silently slip off that dying mislynch wagon without any explanation why.<br>\n<br>\nA week goes by, and despite your issue with greymarble being cleared up you're suddenly still hating on the grey/emp/gorilla town alliance, and more specifically still hating on <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">grey</div>, who really has been nothing but town by that point? I don't see the town motivation for trying to break up town reads.<br>\n<br>\nNow here's what I'm really not getting. Ion's wagon reaches its peak, Ion claims, people don't know how to take this claim, <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">then</div> you finally mention Ion, pushing for him to confess his full powers <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">but not actually agreeing with him being scummy</div>. Instead, you want him to fully confess his powers while simultaneously pushing for an empking lynch. Does not compute. Why push for someone to fully disclose their abilities if you don't think they're scummy? One reason is to look like you're against Ion, so that when he flips scum you seem town, without actually <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">being</div> against Ion. You actually say in your next post \"I am OK with lynching someone other than Ion67 today.\" I didn't notice them before, but there are little phrases like this scattered throughout your ISO that are starting to make me feel more than just a little bit uneasy.<br>\n<br>\nAnother one of those moments is when you go \"UNVOTE: Empking because my vote isn't doing any good on him any more. I don't know where I want to put it yet, but both Pine and Greymarble look like likely candidates.\" Funny, up until that point Pine was one of your few <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">town </div>reads, and you've had nothing but polite conversation about Empking's meta with Pine. The instant a wagon forms on him you're suddenly OK with lynching him, without even questioning or commenting about any of the case points? That's not how you operated earlier day one. You questioned everything. It's why I had a town read on you, you didn't just swallow whatever was fed your way. And yet here you are, towards the end of day 1, giving full support to a Pine lynch without any explanation for your change in reads. Oh, and you <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">still </div>keep hampering on about Greymarble without actually giving a case. Trying to push an empking lynch makes sense, he was basically coasting day one. Trying to push a scumhunter lynch and then a scumhunter vig shot was naive but understandable, as he isn't the easiest person to read. But continuously pushing a Grey lynch when your only case against him was because you misread his hydra'ing? Does. Not. Compute.<br>\n<br>\nAlso of note is how after Ion claimed, you really seemed to stop scumhunting altogether, and focussed entirely on creating an elaborate system of setting up potential vig victims. Setting up the vig votes isn't an issue in and of itself, but the way you did it, while ceasing to scumhunt altogether, it's like you're trying to <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">look </div>town while not really <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">being </div>town.<br>\n<br>\nThen, of course, there's this little gem:<br>\n\"I'm not sure if I buy Pine's claim at this moment, but I won't hammer and I don't want to see anyone else hammer until Pine posts this comprehensive case against Silavor that he's trumpeting. Judging by the number of votes currently on Silavor, Pine might have a chance to perhaps alter who gets lynched today. I'm beginning to think though that whomever of the two (silavor and Pine) is not lynched will be in the pool of players for Ion to choose from though.\"<br>\nJust like with Ion, you're so totally <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">for </div>his lynch, not believing his claim and whatnot, but <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">you don't actually want to lynch</div>. What's worse, even though Pine and I are butting heads as hard as we can, thus making for one hell of a bus, you figure whichever one of us doesn't get lynched should be insta-vigged. Even though, more often than not, when two players are so fundamentally against each other, it's usually town vs scum? You're setting up mislynches, rather than taking a stand. You've been doing that all day one, now that I think about it.<br>\n<br>\n\"I didn't say that I found no fault with silavor's actions. I said that I found more fault with Pine's actions than Silavor's. As I have said many times, I will wait until Pine posts his case against Silavor before I make my final decision. Once Pine's case has come out, I will reread both Pine and silavor and make my decision as to who I'd rather see lynched. How much does it really matter who we lynch today between those two?

The town loses interest in me, the general consensus being that there's no way Pine, Ion and I would pull off such a suicidal bus, and I stop being a mislynch candidate for day 2. Once again, you do something that can't be adequately explained from a town point of view, yet can be perfectly explained from a scum mindset.", "time": "Thu May 19, 2011 7:22 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=17230&start=925", "forum": "53", "thread": "17230"}

That doesn't just <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">happen</div>.</div></blockquote>Well, let's have a look at these gems and see who completely flipped 180: <blockquote><div><cite>silavor wrote:</cite>I have a really hard time buying E Lou as scum based on his interactions with Ion and Pine...</div></blockquote><blockquote><div><cite>silavor wrote:</cite>Now here's what I'm really not getting. Ion's wagon reaches its peak, Ion claims, people don't know how to take this claim, then you finally mention Ion, pushing for him to confess his full powers but not actually agreeing with him being scummy. Instead, you want him to fully confess his powers while simultaneously pushing for an empking lynch. Does not compute. Why push for someone to fully disclose their abilities if you don't think they're scummy? One reason is to look like you're against Ion, so that when he flips scum you seem town, without actually being against Ion. You actually say in your next post \"I am OK with lynching someone other than Ion67 today.\" I didn't notice them before, but there are little phrases like this scattered throughout your ISO that are starting to make me feel more than just a little bit uneasy.<br>\n<br>\nAnother one of those moments is when you go \"UNVOTE: Empking because my vote isn't doing any good on him any more. I don't know where I want to put it yet, but both Pine and Greymarble look like likely candidates.\" Funny, up until that point Pine was one of your few town reads, and you've had nothing but polite conversation about Empking's meta with Pine. The instant a wagon forms on him you're suddenly OK with lynching him, without even questioning or commenting about any of the case points? That's not how you operated earlier day one. You questioned everything. It's why I had a town read on you, you didn't just swallow whatever was fed your way. And yet here you are, towards the end of day 1, giving full support to a Pine lynch without any explanation for your change in reads. Oh, and you still keep hampering on about Greymarble without actually giving a case. Trying to push an empking lynch makes sense, he was basically coasting day one. Trying to push a scumhunter lynch and then a scumhunter vig shot was naive but understandable, as he isn't the easiest person to read. But continuously pushing a Grey lynch when your only case against him was because you misread his hydra'ing? Does. Not. Compute.<br>\n<br>\nAlso of note is how after Ion claimed, you really seemed to stop scumhunting altogether, and focussed entirely on creating an elaborate system of setting up potential vig victims. Setting up the vig votes isn't an issue in and of itself, but the way you did it, while ceasing to scumhunt altogether, it's like you're trying to look town while not really being town.<br>\n<br>\nThen, of course, there's this little gem:<br>\n\"I'm not sure if I buy Pine's claim at this moment, but I won't hammer and I don't want to see anyone else hammer until Pine posts this comprehensive case against Silavor that he's trumpeting. Judging by the number of votes currently on Silavor, Pine might have a chance to perhaps alter who gets lynched today. I'm beginning to think though that whomever of the two (silavor and Pine) is not lynched will be in the pool of players for Ion to choose from though.\"<br>\nJust like with Ion, you're so totally for his lynch, not believing his claim and whatnot, but you don't actually want to lynch. What's worse, even though Pine and I are butting heads as hard as we can, thus making for one hell of a bus, you figure whichever one of us doesn't get lynched should be insta-vigged. Even though, more often than not, when two players are so fundamentally against each other, it's usually town vs scum? You're setting up mislynches, rather than taking a stand. You've been doing that all day one, now that I think about it.<br>\n<br>\n\"I didn't say that I found no fault with silavor's actions. I said that I found more fault with Pine's actions than Silavor's. As I have said many times, I will wait until Pine posts his case against Silavor before I make my final decision. Once Pine's case has come out, I will reread both Pine and silavor and make my decision as to who I'd rather see lynched. How much does it really matter who we lynch today between those two? The other one will end up on the Ion67 vig pool and there's been enough friction between the two of them that lynching one could give us enough information about the other to tell us if they should be lynched tomorrow should one of the two (Pine and silavor) survive the night.\"<br>\nThis quote nicely sums up most of the issues and inconsistencies you've shown throughout day one. The only other time you mention me is to say I'm townish, but need to post more. The only other time you mention Pine is to say he's gut town. Then we both end up L-2, and suddenly we're both simultaneously obvscum? You never mention a case on me, you never mention a case on Pine, you just say one should be lynched, the other vigged, and if one of us somehow survives to day 2 we should be lynched then. If you truly believed that made any sense whatsoever, why didn't you push for a lynch on me day 2?</div></blockquote>  Let me get this straight.  You said you had a hard time seeing me as scum because of my interactions with Pine and Ion, and now you're saying that my interactions with Pine and Ion automatically make me scummy?<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">FoS: silavor and Slaxx.  Silavor for above reasons and Slaxx because he's still a prime suspect.</div><br>\n<br>\nI suggest we lynch either silavor or Slaxx today.  They are the only ones we can confirm visited Empking on a night when there were no kills and it would appear that Empking was the target.  I know this might seem like an OMGUS and to a point it is, but I am serious about my suspicions here.

So just in case they are both town (Hint: they probably aren't), I have come to the following conclusion:<br>\n<br>\nIf Akira flips town 1-shot tracker, nintendo is going to look bad. BUT, this means he will be alive and most likely lynched the next day (regardless of alignment, scum he will of course be alive, if town than he is too tempting of mislynch fodder with all our PR claims). If he happens to be actual tracker, he might be able to clear another person of the kill.

Only roleclaims doctor after being tracked visiting Empking and after another protective role has already been claimed.<br>\n<br>\n2. Jumped off the Pine bandwagon just before he got lynched.<br>\n<br>\nAnd the number 1 reason Slaxx is scum...<br>\n<br>\n1. He said time and time again that the scum have daytalk even though he shouldn&#8217;t know that.<br>\n<br>\nFootnote: He also said with 100% certainty that there weren't two scumgroups even though in his own words \"we're nowhere near lylo.\" <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: Slaxx</div>  Like it or not, it doesn&#8217;t appear that Empking will be lynched today so I&#8217;m throwing my lot with my next best suspect.  Come day 5, if Empking and I are both still alive and our lynch victim flips town, I will unload my case against Empking and we will see who the scum really is.  Since between my two suspects, Slaxx hasn&#8217;t been copcleared or anything like that and Empking has, I will go with Slaxx for today.  Gorilla, the floor and the hammer are yours.

Due to this setup, however, my main concern was a day one where a number of players were pushed to -1 and when they claimed their ability the rest of the town would back off and push another person to claim. Basically I was worried there would be an almost massclaim by proxy day one. To attempt to lessen the chances of this happening I added an extra vanilla townie, and to ensure the setup didn't become too predictable I added a normal nightly-use power role on both sides, and even doubled up one of the roles (tracker) on the town side.<br>\n<br>\nAlthough the mafia did lose by a bit of a landslide they were rather unlucky to have <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">both </div>of their power-roles out of action by day 2. I think normally this sort of set-up would be a closer run affair. My only regret is the 1-shot cop.
