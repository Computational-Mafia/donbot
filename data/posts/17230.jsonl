This is a game. Have fun. Don't let things get personal.<br><br>2. During Day, you may vote for the player you want to lynch. Votes should be in the form <span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: Player</span> or they may not be counted. It is helpful to \"<span class=\"noboldsig\">Unvote</span>\" when switching your vote to a different player, though this is not required.<br><br>3. Whenever a player has a majority in votes, that player will be lynched, his or her role will be revealed, and Night will begin. Once a player has reached a majority, Twilight will begin. No votes or unvotes will be registered, although talking may continue until the thread is locked. You may also <span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: No Lynch</span>; a majority will end Day without a death.<br><br>4. If discussion lags or Day goes on for too long, a deadline may be set. If no one has reached a majority at the deadline, the person with the most votes will be lynched.<br><br>5. During Night, players with role abilities may send targets for those abilities. Choices are due by the posted deadline, but day may start earlier if the choices are sent in early.<br><br>6. Don't edit/delete posts. Use the \"Preview\" button to look over your post before you submit it.<br><br>7. Don't quote any PMs from the Moderator.<br><br>8. <span class=\"noboldsig\">Mafia, werewolves, masons etc. are allowed to communicate by PM/QT at all times</span> (i.e. not just during the night phase). Otherwise, do not talk to anyone about this game outside the thread.<br><br>9. When you are killed you may make one final post (as long as it is simply an \"oh well\" type post that doesn't reveal any game information), but then you are dead. Do not talk until the game is over; this includes talking to living players outside the thread.<br><br>10. I will send out prods at my discretion/on request. Players may be replaced if a prod is not responded to.<br><br>11. No attempting to break the game with cryptography or invisible text etc.<br><br>12. If you have any question, complaint, or comment, PM the Moderator.<br><br>13. I reserve the right to add or modify a rule as I see fit</fieldset>"}

I feel I can best help town by reading and sifting through the nonsense that has been created and participating when I have an opinion of actual importance.

Like, she enjoys expressing herself in games. A lot. I'm getting kind of a locked up vibe from her this game.

Now for reads that I have put off a little too long.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"> Akira: </span> Slight Town. I get the feel by the questions he has directed ask me he is almost trying to see my towniness as opposed to just wanting to lynch me. I get a decent town read off of that. But his initial play still just bugs me. Definitely someone I could see being town as the game moves on.<br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic\">Akira, what are YOUR thoughts on Jess? What do you think of the people who were on your bandwagon? Are you getting any solid towntells off of anyone?</span><br><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"> Dazzy: </span> Scum (but not with Duplicity). He held his RVS on what I thought to be a fairly obvious townie, then unvoted and has not pressured anyone since but continues to defend himself. Says he isn't a fan of the Akira wagon but doesn't exactly offer up any alternatives. Not a good start for sure. When asked for FoSs he just throws together the general consensus of everyone else's without offering new content. However, Duplicity's case on him is incredibly misguided. Way too nitpicky. They aren't both scum, this I'm pretty sure of.<br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic\">Dazzy, explain why you FoSed the people you did.</span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"> Duplicity: </span> Scum (but not with Dazzy). Although his initial methodology gave me a town read on him, I really am not liking his most recent posts, especially his interactions with Dazzy. Secondly, the second half of the hydra head came in and decided to vote a null player for pressure. That's good because its exactly what I did with Jess, but he pretty much ignored everything else that was going on, once again naming FoSs that everyone else had already brought up. Althoug I love the Silavor FoS (I will get to that in a bit).<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"> E_Lou: </span> Slight Town. Needs more content, but nothing I have seen so far rings as scummy. I like how he calls out Grey for lack of content. He needs more than just a Scumhunter scumread though or my opinion of him may quickly turn around. <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"> Greymarble: </span> Neutral. Needs more content and explanation of reads. I like where he is coming from with the Quilf FoS but idk if I agree. I'm getting slight gut town vibes from Quil.<br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic\"> Greymarble, I will tell you how I feel about Pine in this very post! How do you feel about Duplicity and his case on Dazzy?</span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"> Ion: </span> Slight Scum (but not with Duplicity). Needs more content from his posts. Duplicity's catch on the wiki article is decent, but I'm not fully sold yet. I like the way he criticized Duplicity's case but didn't jump on it, it means they probably aren't partners. I don't like how conservative he is with his vote and how he seems to be a little concerned about people who FoS him. <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Jess: </span> Neutral. for the love of god I cannot read her. I cannot tell if she is legitimately bored with the game already or if she is trying to shy away from the wrath that is my scumhunting. I like how she gave a read without being prompted (the Ion=slight town) but 1. I don't agree with that tell and 2. it is the only tell I haven't had to extract from her. More pressure on Jess probably won't be a bad thing.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"> Nintendo: </span> Town. His very first post was a towntell. His other posts haven't rang scum. This read is malleable but I won't drop it easy. Maybe I just want to believe it because I am having a difficult time pulling town tells out of this game, but hey, we all need something to believe in. He needs to focus on someone other than scumhunter though. I think I saw some Dazzy hate in his posts (I can dig that) so he gets brownie points there.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"> Pine: </span> Neutral. I like the Akira vote, but he has since tunneled on Scumhunter. Needs more reads and more content. I need to check out Pine town because I have only seen Pine scum and idk why but I feel like I'm going to have to use meta on him. I know when I first saw his play as scum in the game I modded I felt like he was getting lynched not because he was scummy but because of his playstyle and he just happened to be scum. Anyway I am probably going to go stalk his town games when I have some free time.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"> Quil: </span> Slight Scum. I don't like the early mudflinging on nintendo or the sheeping on Akira or the scumhunter vote. I said earlier I had a gut town read on Quil but after looking at her Iso...yeah, I get where you whoever I said that to is coming from.<br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic\"> Quil, care to explain your town reads? </span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"> Scumhunter: </span> Gut town. He's way more competent than he appears, and I feel like if he was scum he would have started appeasing the town by outting some read by now. I'm not a huge fan of the people pressuring him (except maybe nintendo, who I still think is midsguided newbie town), so that helps his case too.<br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic\"> Hi old friend, can you please out some reads now &gt;.&gt;</span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"> Silavor: </span> Scum. He has shot down most everyone's reads and pressured scumhunter, quite possibly the easiest target here. Questions a lot of people's reads but doesn't contribute much of his own.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"> unvote, vote: Silavor </span><br><br><br>I am keeping my eye on you Jess."}

My issue earlier was simply his lack of any content and being difficult.<br><br>Quilford - Mainly got a scummy read on him for the Akira sheep. Then he still didn't justfiy himself when asked about it. Now that Scumhunter is under pressure, he's gone and sheeped again, reinforcing my earlier read. No reasoning for ditching his Akira vote, no reasoning (besides one half-sentence) for his new vote. Overall lack of material. Stronger scum-read than before.<br><br>Ion - Was mostly gut at the time, I agreed with a couple of small points made by others and that was my way of expressing it. For now he's a null for me, I can't see any big issues with his posts.<br><br>Pine - Again, mostly just a feeling. He was giving opinions and doing something while encouraging people to back up their votes. I'm not perfectly comfortable with his last couple of actions (Akira unvote and Scumhunter vote), mainly because I'm not seeing SH being scum, and think the wagon is a bad idea at this point, and so his read regresses to null with light town for now.<br><br>Hopefully this is satisfactory.<br><br>Now: New stuff.<br><br>I'd really like GreyMarble to back up his vote on Pine.

I have decided to put my town reads first as I think they are the most important.<br><br>Town Reads:<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">silavor</span>: I think you are town. Maybe its your swagger. Interesting angle about how outing town reads day 1 helps mafia more than town. Alas, I actually agree with you on that one (as I post reads)!

Verdict: Town<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Slaxx</span>: Town read for the moment. All his posts have been on topic and to the point. Plus, Slaxx as mafia loves to bus even day 1.

Verdict: Null<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Akira</span>: As others have pointed out, it seemed odd that you felt the need to justify your vote in the RVS stage. Duplicity does overstate cases WAY more than you. Stating that you admit to overstating cases for pressure defeats the purpose doesn't it? If you are town, you aren't very good at applying pressure, just sayin. Verdict: Null<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">E_Lou_Sive</span>: I apologize for not posting sooner. I am in a bunch of games right now and am usually active. I went meh early on in this game when I made one post and Pine was like \"Case. Now.\" I didn't really want to deal with the needless intensity at that point so I decided I was going to focus my energy on other games and let things play out for a while. Seeing as I am town, you should probably start looking for other foses though. Verdict: Null <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">nintendoaddict1</span>: Ha. I am not saying there is no reason to scumhunt day 1. What I was saying is actually very similar to what you have been saying so far this game, in that in a day start game with 13 people (and probably 4 mafia) how serious can we take these minute reads that we supposedly have on people? Verdict: Null<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Dazzy</span>: Are you buddying me <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\"> Don't be nice to me in games or I will likely think you are trying to trick me somehow. Verdict: Null<br><br>Scum Reads: <br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Ion67</span>: I have a scum read here. Ion, maybe I read too much into the way people say things. But when you said \"I don't understand anything nintendo is saying...\" Why not just ask him specifically about what you don't understand? Also it always raises a red flag to me when someone says. \"It seems a bit like...\" or something to that effect. It shows an unwillingness to ruffle feathers and have an opinion. That type of apologetic scumhunting is often mafia tactics in my experience. Verdict: Leaning Scum<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Jessa</span>: What is wrong with pulling metagame in? It is a legitimate strategy. Anything in the world that is competitive involves metagame. Sports, warfare, political debates all use metagame. Only mafia wouldn't want town to use everything at its disposal to rid the world of scum. Another thing I have noticed is that all of the reads you have posted you have also posted some sort of justification/excuse for. As town (to use metagame  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\"> ) you tend to be more proactive, but then again so do I. I can understand the going bleh, i don't feel like posting, everytime I open this particular thread but I do think there is a slightly above average chance you are scum at this point. Verdict: Very Slight Lean Scum <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Quilford/Empking</span>: Putting aside your vote on me which I can understand to this point, not sure what I think of you. It concerns me that you fos silavor, who is one of my top town reads at this point. Verdict: Slight Lean Scum.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Pine</span>: Why say you have a hard time seeing scum acting the way I have been, yet still vote me? Isn't the point of this game to vote who you think is mafia? That action in itself is anti-town. Verdict: Slight Lean Scum.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: Ion67</span>"}

ISO #12 he states he was \"hoping no one would point it out\" referring to what Scumhunter said. Is it really because your pressuring would have lasted longer? Or is it because you hoped no one would see that slip?<br><br>E_Lou_Sive - He's only posted four times, so the lack of content I find scummy.<br><br>Scumhunter - I really don't see what the strong case on Slaxx was that he was talking about, and sure lynching one person in previous mafia games might have been good, but in those games if Scumhunter was scum and Slaxx was town, he could still say that. And yet, he says that he has found no one worth a vote... after he votes for Slaxx.<br><br>Quilford (Empking) - The abridged post: when asked why he didn't vote for me after asking \"what's so wtf about a day start\" he said it's because he thinks I'm a newb. Yet in his posts where he listed his reads,(though no reasoning behind them) he listed me under scum. In other news, he votes Akira because of \"scummy over-justification\" yet he lists Akira under null? But never mind, now Emp has taken over and none of that really makes any sense anymore.<br><br>salivor - Sure, he's been actively posting. But most of the content, or at least what I can gather from his posts has not much of his own in it. Most of the time he will just ask a question to say \"HEY GUYS I'M NOT LURKING.\"<br><br>Pine - Pine was the first to vote. Pine was also the one who said on his next post that early bandwagons are good, but sheeping onto them without information is not. He even goes on to tell Quil off about it in post #96. He also states that Quil is pretty new to this in that same post, but then in post #103 he slams Quil again for acting scummy when he just said a few posts that Quil is new. So, Pine... Do you think Quil was acting scummy? Or do you think he is just new?<br><br>Dazzy - Going back to the time we talked about Dazzy's contradiction: check out his ISO #5. He says I'm most likely town, yet in his next paragraph, he says he has no strong leads. I don't know about you, but I like to think a phrase like \"most likely\" = strong.<br><br>Greymarble - The second to vote. He didn't provide a case nor was there a case on Akira in the first place. I know what you're thinking. I voted for Akira too, I know. I don't even remember my logic behind it at the time, I was probably just so stunned about the day start, but we won't go back to that. But they've done quite a bit of scumhunting already so I am having a hard time thinking they are scum."}

As for Quilford, I liked how he put his vote somewhere productive after he was told.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Scumhunter</span>-Town<br>He was obviously RVS'ing on a friend until he came up with something better. <br><blockquote><div><cite>Scumhunter wrote:</cite>\"I think if you reread my posts with a fine-toothed comb, you will see some of the intricacies that have breadcrumbed my fos on Slaxx.\" </div></blockquote><br>Anyone who thinks that's serious is making me lol. As for his interactions with Pine, I think his reactions and responses were that of a town player.  He knew that any case he could make on Slaxx would be ridiculous, and as it was an RVS there wouldn't be a case at this point.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Silavor</span>- Null leaning towards scum.<br>I think his reaction here is a bit over the top. That also makes me question it as being scummy though because mafia expect to be scrutinized.  I just really don't like his reaction.<br><blockquote><div><cite>silavor wrote:</cite>\"In what way have I \"shot down most everyone's reads?\" If by \"most everyone\" you mean \"duplicity\" and \"reads\" you mean \"one fucktarded misread of a quote\" then fine, I confess to shooting down stupidity. And what's scummy exactly about pressuring someone who is either scum or lazy town? Either way it helps the town win, so unless you're a practitioner of insane troll logic how exactly does any of that make me scum?<br>Personally, I don't like sharing town reads this early, because it generally helps scum build mislynches and figure out who they can buddy more than it helps town narrow down the list of scum. But if it's oh so vital to you that you know who I think is town, then just ask, and I'll tell.\"</div></blockquote><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Slaxx</span>- Null leaning towards town.<br>Can't read him for shit. I do like his pressure on Silavor and myself. He is right about me. I like my opinion to be heard and whatnot and I'm much more avid of a poster. Just lost steam because of my other games. (That's the last time I'll use that as an excuse I promise.) Despite my gut read, his interactions with others and Silavor's above earlier overreaction, I think he's town. Although, as how I am with Duplicity, I will always be wary of him.<br><br>Okay, I have a bit of time today to respond to Duplicity and Scumhunter's reads on me.

Apparently I need to be more black and white with my reads for you? As for unvoting Slaxx, I unvoted him because the original vote wasn't even a real RVS vote. It was more of a joke omgus vote on him. I took that time to unvote because I don't like to have a vote on so early on day one, let alone when there are a few votes on the person. I don't like the RVS stage, and I generally try to withhold my vote if I can. As for appearance vs. action, this goes with my previous sentence. I don't like to vote willy-nilly just because I can. I know it's not a town tell. Slaxx asked for my read on him. Comparatively, I think most of his posts have contained content and I just don't see him as mafia yet.

Honestly at this point I forget why I even said he was potentially town. TO ME, I think pushing back on a strong-headed pushy player to be town ish to me in a way. Hard to explain I guess.

Lost my net access last night while typing up a post, locking me out and losing my post in the process.<br><br>Being home has been a lot more hectic than I was expecting, realistically I should have put in a V/LA, I apologise.<br><br>Some reads:<br><br>Looking again at Silavor, I find myself seeing him as a possible lynch candidate. His ISO consists of questioning Duplicity's end-of-post reads, voting Scumhunter quite early with one sentence of justification (which is fine for me because it WAS early), pushing ScumHunter for reads, and then voting Ion for being inactive.<br><br>He refused to give his input in regards to Duplicity's reads (the end-of-post thing), but never gave a reason for why he didn't want to. He voted early and left his vote there while a wagon built, without reinforcing it except for once. And in that one follow-up against SH, all he says is:<br><blockquote><div><cite>silavor wrote:</cite> <br>...<br>We're not asking for Mastin-sized cases here, just your opinions on what's happend, and what you think is scummy.<br>...<br></div></blockquote><br><br>What I find interesting is that while Silavor is asking for cases and pressuring people he doesn't think are contributing, he's not taking any solid stances himself, or putting himself out there. He'll \"provide reads if he's asked for them\", but jumps on others for not sharing? So, Silavor, I'm gonna ask why you haven't answered your own question:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>silavor wrote:</cite><span class=\"noboldsig\">Unvote:Scumhunter</span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote:Ion</span><br>It's been five days since your last post, and you still don't have any solid reads.

I was even going through all the scenarios of what he could do and what it could mean. Then SH gave him a decent reason to leave his vote where it is. *sigh*<br><br>Pine remains a null for now. I need a bit more time to analyze how this situation will continue.<br><br>SH... Initially I didn't think scum would play like he has been, and posting his reads helped, but looking back on them, they are almost all extremely shallow. Obviously it's difficult to get some surefire reads going on D1, but when relating this post to his others, you can see that most of it is like the rest of his input - fluff meant to distract from a lack of actual content. His follow-up also stands out - he's clamoring for attention, trying to make us all see how pro-town he is by posting his reads. Still not sure on him, but definitely increased suspicion. Meh. Scum-null.<br>This little tidbit made me laugh a little.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Scumhunter wrote:</cite><span class=\"noboldsig\">Slaxx</span>: Town read for the moment.

Since you know your meta and know what towntells you're dropping, it seems easy enough to fake.  You know what's not easy to fake?  Interactions.  I have rarely seen scum who can 'naturally' scumhunt a buddy.  Scum can scumhunt town (although it's a bit of a knack) but it is HARD to do the 'question and answer when you feel out your partner's alignment' when you <span class=\"noboldsig\">both</span> know your partner's alignment.  Neither has any curiousity, but both of you have to fake it?  Sure friggin Reckoner and SpyreX could probably do the dance, but SpyreX and, say, Baby Spice ( a decent scum player, but by no means exceptional)? No.  BS would eventually drop the ball.  So get out and interact with other players.<br><br>2) You're not really DOING anything.  It might not make you mafia, but given the choice of day 1 lynches, I'll choose someone who I'm 70% sure will flip town and is doing NOTHING over someone who is 50% likely to flip town and is doing lots (note: percentages courtesy of my ass).

Part of the job of scumhunting is reading people, and that includes reading whether a person's appeal to emotion is an actual appeal or a mafia ploy.

A town tell from one person is a scumtell from another and vice versa.

I am voting for Ion, who has posted minimally and whose posts I found scummy and am voting for. Unfortunately, I have had to spend most of my time this game defending myself from baseless attacks."}

If you want to play games well on Mafiascum, and do your wincon some good, you should try to find your scum and stop relying on everyone else.<br><br>The point of RVS is for reactions. You're supposed to get bad reactions in order to get scum. Once you get this bad reaction, you are able to bandwagon on the plausible scum and see how they react, maybe get a claim. There is a point, you just haven't thought that far yet, unfortunately.<br><br>Why hasn't Dazzy, after looking at #53, realized that Nintendo is an ultra-newbie and is probably not scum? Hmmzorz.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Nintendo wrote:</cite>If lynching people for no reason is not pro-town, then why are you even voting in the first place? There is no way to know what role or alignment a person has at this point.</div></blockquote>I think you have to realize that there's a huge difference between voting and lynching.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Nintendo wrote:</cite>And how is that a random accusation? You are voting for me simply because I have played mafia on another site? That was not random at all. And if that is your only reason for voting me then it is moot.</div></blockquote>Makes you kind of think why Nintendo thinks his vote is good, and if he's possibly faking. It'd be a good reveal, but probably not. I will admit that Dazzzy did find a bad reaction of Nintendo, but meh.<br><br>Let's let him pass for now? I can't see him being scum yet.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Pine wrote:</cite>...Seriously?

Progress!<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Akira wrote:</cite>2) So I'm not supposed to justify my vote?</div></blockquote>If someone wants to hear the justification for your vote, they'll ask. I don't think anyone cared about your vote until you added that little tidbit. I'll leave you as cautious leaning scum though. Sound fair? <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Akira wrote:</cite>3) I'm intentionally overstating my case for pressure, okay? It's the best you can do on D1.</div></blockquote>Ha. That's good bullshit. Restating something without having any break is like telling someone to do something twice. Does it get them to do it faster? No, it just annoys them.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Duplicity wrote:</cite>I'm going to attempt to do something different this game.

If anything, Scumhunter is the newbie for having not played forum mafia before at all. At least, that was my impression based on the back-and-forth between Scumhunter, Slaxx and Jessa. Either way, both Scumhunter and Nintendo are new to Mafiascum, so what <span style=\"font-style: italic\">exactly </span>is your point?

Like Slaxx pointed out, you're defending nintendo using the same logic used to attack scumhunter, and that awful WIFOM excuse of scumhunter and I being scum doesn't hold water. I wasn't the only one thinking scumhunter couldn't be scum, I was just the first to add in scum daytalk evidence. You also have basically the entire town listed as null/leaning scum. Way to take a stance on things. Wait, isn't that one of the things that makes me your \"top suspect?\" Lolirony is lol. You say greymarble's \"not as obvtown as everyone seems to be assuming,\" but give no evidence to why our reads on him are wrong. In other words, <span style=\"font-style: italic\">WAY TO TAKE A STANCE ON THINGS.</span> What's worse is you don't even think Greymarble's scum, you just don't like us having a solid town read on him. As for your bit about scumhunter, go back and actually <span style=\"font-style: italic\">read </span>the thread. Scumhunter says the line you \"really don't like\" in post <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2995976#p2995976\" class=\"postlink\">347</a>, but pine doesn't unvote until <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2997621#p2997621\" class=\"postlink\">356</a>. All in all, the only thing fishy here is your inability to make real reads.<br><br>And for the record, saying \"I don't like sharing town reads\" is not synonymous with \"my reads are magical and dangerous.\" Not everyone had posted a list of town reads when I said that, and my reasoning for not sharing my town reads was very valid. Your other point about me avoiding taking stances is blatant misrepping, as I've been for an Ion lynch since the [ur=http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=2988540#p2988540l]24th[/url].

For example, suppose that Ion is not given somebody specific to shoot, and when the first post of the day comes in there is only one NK.  We will not know who did it and I certainly wouldn't take Ion at his word about being a JOAT because he could easily also be scum, town vig, or SK among others.  Two of the three examples I just gave are considered threats to the town so I refuse to let Ion slither away.  I also disagree that \"Empking wagon sucks more,\" but it's too late at night for me to write up my whole case against him so expect it within the next 48 hours.

If you don't play 3rd ed.

Why do you believe that the three people you named are scum?<br></div></blockquote><br>First, let's establish the fact that there is scummy, and then there's <span style=\"font-style: italic\">scum</span>. There's a <span style=\"font-style: italic\">big </span>difference. Reading Scumhunter, all I see the entire way through is a bunch of joke posts with the odd read thrown in. That may be scummy, but it's not scum. Slaxx proved SH innocent when he proved himself guilty, by pointing out scum have daytalk. <span style=\"font-style: italic\">Think </span>for a second; if Scumhunter were scum, that means he's in constant contact with another player or two out of the thread. Having actually <span style=\"font-style: italic\">been </span>scum in a game where daytalk was available, I can tell you first-hand that if one of your members is struggling, you give them some of your reads and cases so it looks like they're helping, and everyone shuts up about them. If all else fails, if your partner's taking heat from posting too many joke posts, you can at least tell him to shut up and lay low for a bit, until the heat wears off. Based on Scumhunter's actions, he hasn't been told to do <span style=\"font-style: italic\">any </span>of these things. In fact, his behavior hasn't changed the slightest the whole game through, which is something that <span style=\"font-style: italic\">simply doesn't happen</span> with players like him in daytalk scum games.<br>Fact: Scumhunter is town.</div></blockquote><br>That is...actually a remarkably good point. I'll review this in the morning, and see if I still feel it rings true. This is by far the best defense of SH all game so far. I don't know if it saves him though, as I'd probably be looking at bussing a useless teammate and stubborn players that think they're hot shit tend not to take advice very well.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Grey's already pointed out why Pine's scum, and if you go reread Pine, you'll see that his tone shifts radically once someone suspects Slaxx.</div></blockquote><br>What the fuck are you talking about?

I've been pushing on Scumhunter most of the game because he's been playing really very scummy, right from his first posts. The fact that he seems to think this is EpicMafia, where no one does anything until a few Townies are dead and a Cop has a few reads, has nothing to do with it.<br><br>And the read on Jessa was SPECIFICALLY REQUESTED by your hero, Greymarble.

I fully intend to condemn someone to death as soon as I hear all the evidence as well as cases from both parties.  I have heard silavor's case against Pine already but Pine's case has not showed up.  Unless you're saying that you think I'm going to act like a judge, I'm not going to pull a Pontius Pilate.  As soon as I have finished my rereads of Pine and silavor I shall cast my vote.  Before you bad mouth Pontius Pilates, the way the votes have shaken out and based on the amount of conviction among those who are on both wagons at the moment, someone is going to end up having to judge these two suspects and decide who gets lynched.  The three players who are not on either wagon are Ion67, Slaxx, and me.  Whichever one you trust the most to make a good decision can be the one to drop the hammer.  However, Ion67 has proceeded to lurk ever since he claimed JOAT so I doubt he will return to vote which means unless somebody on one of the wagons switches wagons, the final decision will come down to Slaxx's vote and mine.  Empking did say he was considering switching bandwagons to Pine though.  As I said, I shall finish my rereads of Pine and silavor and cast my official vote sometime tomorrow and that vote will not move until the end of Day 1 unless Pine's case against silavor comes out after I have cast my vote.  In that instance, I reserve the right to flip-flop if Pine's case against silavor has any effect on my vote."}

However, that contradicts my read on scumhunter from basically the entire game, and I'm not quite ready to believe that just yet. Gorilla and E_lou could be a scumteam together, but I don't think E_lou is good enough to look this townie while actually being scum.

I don't believe it's a dual scumteam game, the connections just don't seem to be there. Slaxx, however, makes sense.

My vote on nintendo was for pressure and lol its already hammered? On the guy who fosed Pine + Ion as two of his 4 suspects?  I feel like I derped by letting that lynch go through and I didn't even vote him.<br><br>Slaxx, the way you said \"take it or leave it\" with your claim yesterday was strange to me.

I just don't know. I need time to think on this. Rambling thoughts time! <br>I agree that it probably is a choice between Slaxx and Elousive. I don't like the thought of Elouscum, but it wouldn't be the first time a townie tone that rarely posts manages to pull the wool over my eyes. Slaxx's reasoning for protecting empking is the same reason I protected him, and is probably the same reason the last scum tried to kill him; he was the only truly confirmed town at that point, and if I recall correctly he hadn't claimed at that point, so Empking was basically a confirmed town with a totally unknown power. <br><br>As for Nintendo, that's an obvious kill as well; he had a reusable power in a game of one-shots. Even though we probably would have mislynched him today, Nintendo could claim who he tracked last night so once he did die we'd take his final track seriously. Who would have been Nintendo's final track? It probably would have been Elou or Slaxx, and it would have won us the game, because even if the track didn't show anything it would've meant the other was guilty then. Time to go back to day one I guess. The answer's there, it always is, I just gotta find it."}

The quotes below will show my line of logic which I will clarify afterward:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>ThAdmiral wrote:</cite>You wake up and find that no one is dead.<br><br>It is now Day 3. With 9 alive it is 5 to lynch.</div></blockquote>This night is the first (and thus far only) night with no kills.  <blockquote><div><cite>Scumhunter wrote:</cite>awesome. last night probably not a no kill.<br><br>Mafia was either roleblocked or we had a doc save.</div></blockquote><blockquote><div><cite>silavor on Day 3 wrote:</cite>claiming one-shot jailkeeper who protected Empking last night.</div></blockquote><blockquote><div><cite>Akira wrote:</cite>I'm a 1-shot tracker. I targeted Slaxx and he targeted Empking.</div></blockquote><blockquote><div><cite>Slaxx wrote:</cite>1-shot doc, take it or leave it. Protected Empking.</div></blockquote><br><br>Here is my logic stemming from Night 2.  If we assume all of those who I quoted above are telling the truth about their roleclaims (and we know Akira is,) then that severely limits our suspect list to gorilla (who I see as town), me (but I'm VT as I said before), Mogri (who could well be scum but I think he's town due to not being cc'd when he claimed oneshot vig who killed Ion), and Empking.  Empking comes under heavy suspicion from me because the one night that the town roleblocks him, there is no kill.  If there is only one scum left it would be stupid for them to not kill someone at night.  There is also the possibility that one of the people whom I quoted above lied about their roleclaim and are scum.  If that's the case, then the scum would be silavor (whom I clear on the grounds that his JK role apparently got us to the nokill night 2), Scumhunter (who could easily be lying about his cop result but I don't think he is), or Slaxx.  Slaxx could easily be lying about being a oneshot doc who protected Empking.  For all we know, he could have gone to Empking's house to kill him.<br><br>Thus, if everyone who I quoted above is telling the truth about their role, then Empking is my prime suspect.  If, however, someone is lying about their role I believe Slaxx to be the most likely liar because he only claimed oneshot doc after it was suggested that he could be doc by yours truly.  I'm not going to vote for either one yet because I don't feel like I have enough proof that either one is guilty.  I just thought I'd throw my line of thought out there and see what everyone else thought."}

I'm not saying we're not suspicious (feel free to suspect me all you want, you've earned that right after all that went down the past two days), I'm just saying that we shouldn't necessarily let everyone else go scot-free especially because of the high number of players that claim to have cleared Empking in some fashion.

You also try to break up the first town alliance that forms, with your only reasoning being that you misinterpreted Greymarble's hydra-ness as being scum contradicting itself. Then when you confess that you didn't know it was a hydra, you unvote your <span style=\"font-style: italic\">Scumhunter</span> vote, to silently slip off that dying mislynch wagon without any explanation why.<br><br>A week goes by, and despite your issue with greymarble being cleared up you're suddenly still hating on the grey/emp/gorilla town alliance, and more specifically still hating on <span style=\"font-style: italic\">grey</span>, who really has been nothing but town by that point? I don't see the town motivation for trying to break up town reads.<br><br>Now here's what I'm really not getting.

Instead, you want him to fully confess his powers while simultaneously pushing for an empking lynch. Does not compute.

You actually say in your next post \"I am OK with lynching someone other than Ion67 today.\" I didn't notice them before, but there are little phrases like this scattered throughout your ISO that are starting to make me feel more than just a little bit uneasy.<br><br>Another one of those moments is when you go \"UNVOTE: Empking because my vote isn't doing any good on him any more. I don't know where I want to put it yet, but both Pine and Greymarble look like likely candidates.\" Funny, up until that point Pine was one of your few <span style=\"font-style: italic\">town </span>reads, and you've had nothing but polite conversation about Empking's meta with Pine. The instant a wagon forms on him you're suddenly OK with lynching him, without even questioning or commenting about any of the case points? That's not how you operated earlier day one. You questioned everything. It's why I had a town read on you, you didn't just swallow whatever was fed your way. And yet here you are, towards the end of day 1, giving full support to a Pine lynch without any explanation for your change in reads. Oh, and you <span style=\"font-style: italic\">still </span>keep hampering on about Greymarble without actually giving a case. Trying to push an empking lynch makes sense, he was basically coasting day one. Trying to push a scumhunter lynch and then a scumhunter vig shot was naive but understandable, as he isn't the easiest person to read. But continuously pushing a Grey lynch when your only case against him was because you misread his hydra'ing? Does. Not. Compute.<br><br>Also of note is how after Ion claimed, you really seemed to stop scumhunting altogether, and focussed entirely on creating an elaborate system of setting up potential vig victims. Setting up the vig votes isn't an issue in and of itself, but the way you did it, while ceasing to scumhunt altogether, it's like you're trying to <span style=\"font-style: italic\">look </span>town while not really <span style=\"font-style: italic\">being </span>town.<br><br>Then, of course, there's this little gem:<br>\"I'm not sure if I buy Pine's claim at this moment, but I won't hammer and I don't want to see anyone else hammer until Pine posts this comprehensive case against Silavor that he's trumpeting. Judging by the number of votes currently on Silavor, Pine might have a chance to perhaps alter who gets lynched today.

Even though, more often than not, when two players are so fundamentally against each other, it's usually town vs scum? You're setting up mislynches, rather than taking a stand. You've been doing that all day one, now that I think about it.<br><br>\"I didn't say that I found no fault with silavor's actions. I said that I found more fault with Pine's actions than Silavor's. As I have said many times, I will wait until Pine posts his case against Silavor before I make my final decision. Once Pine's case has come out, I will reread both Pine and silavor and make my decision as to who I'd rather see lynched. How much does it really matter who we lynch today between those two?

The only other time you mention me is to say I'm townish, but need to post more. The only other time you mention Pine is to say he's gut town. Then we both end up L-2, and suddenly we're <span style=\"font-style: italic\">both simultaneously obvscum?</span> You never mention a case on me, you never mention a case on Pine, you just say one should be lynched, the other vigged, and if one of us somehow survives to day 2 we should be lynched then. If you truly believed that made <span style=\"font-style: italic\">any</span> sense <span style=\"font-style: italic\">whatsoever</span>, why didn't you push for a lynch on me day 2?<br><br>But no, you don't push a lynch on me at all. Pine is hammered, confesses to being scum, then during twilight you say \"I'm beginning to suspect that maybe the second wagon was on another mafioso as nintendo said.

Out of nowhere you completely flip 180 on your interpretation of Pine vs Me. That doesn't just <span style=\"font-style: italic\">happen</span>. You know what <span style=\"font-style: italic\">does </span>just happen? The town loses interest in me, the general consensus being that there's no way Pine, Ion and I would pull off such a suicidal bus, and I stop being a mislynch candidate for day 2. Once again, you do something that can't be adequately explained from a town point of view, yet can be perfectly explained from a scum mindset."}

He said time and time again that the scum have daytalk even though he shouldn\u2019t know that.<br><br>Footnote: He also said with 100% certainty that there weren't two scumgroups even though in his own words \"we're nowhere near lylo.\" <br><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: Slaxx</span>  Like it or not, it doesn\u2019t appear that Empking will be lynched today so I\u2019m throwing my lot with my next best suspect.  Come day 5, if Empking and I are both still alive and our lynch victim flips town, I will unload my case against Empking and we will see who the scum really is.  Since between my two suspects, Slaxx hasn\u2019t been copcleared or anything like that and Empking has, I will go with Slaxx for today.  Gorilla, the floor and the hammer are yours.  Choose wisely."}

Due to this setup, however, my main concern was a day one where a number of players were pushed to -1 and when they claimed their ability the rest of the town would back off and push another person to claim. Basically I was worried there would be an almost massclaim by proxy day one. To attempt to lessen the chances of this happening I added an extra vanilla townie, and to ensure the setup didn't become too predictable I added a normal nightly-use power role on both sides, and even doubled up one of the roles (tracker) on the town side.<br><br>Although the mafia did lose by a bit of a landslide they were rather unlucky to have <span style=\"font-style: italic\">both </span>of their power-roles out of action by day 2. I think normally this sort of set-up would be a closer run affair. My only regret is the 1-shot cop. I normally don't like cop roles as I think they are overpowered and I feel they don't reward skill. Here even in it's 1-shot state it was probably a little too powerful in this game.<br><br>MVP - there were so many good players on the town side to choose from, although I would like to give special props to mogri for the vig on ion, silavor and greymarble for picking the entire scumteam day 1, and scumhunter for generally hunting scum well!<br>...but I am going to give the mvp to Slaxx for sticking in their all the way to the bitter end and providing a decent contest in this fairly one-sided affair."}
