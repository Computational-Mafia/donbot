Not to say that ICE hasn't - but think about it this way. The fight between matt and chk consists of two sets of interactions - matt's actions towards chk, and chk's towards matt.

Townies do it, which is sad, but it's a stupid argument - it's one of those things which is usually based entirely on gut without anything to back it up logically.

I.E. \"this mislynch certainly had scum on it, between these 3 players, I believe X is scum but if he's not then I'm almost certain its Y\" or \"these 3 players can't possibly all be town, so let's lynch X because he's the scummiest but if he's town then Y is almost assuredly scum\", things like that. It just ends up being how I reason through certain things. It doesn't mean I'm going to lynch X today, then Y tomorrow, I'm simply explaining who I feel is scummy, and if X were to happen, this would have Y impact on my future scum reads.<br>\n<br>\nIt seems like every other game there is someone who finds this mentality scummy. I think a failure to think ahead is scummy, because scum have agendas to hide whereas town does not. It really just is a difference in mindset.<br>\n<br>\nIf it came down to being something really important I would go back and find you at least one incidence of it happening but honestly right now it's just more effort than it's worth at the moment.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Implosion wrote:</cite><br>\nletting the town implode.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\nI see what you did there.<br>\n<br>\nI also feel like you're on to something good with denis. Lurker hunting is always good, and it's 5 times better when it can be substantiated as evidence of scum.

I don't see how that's so difficult to understand.

This is absurd, seeing as firstly I didn't have any scumreads on active players and secondly when half the game is lurking it's distinctly possible (not saying it's likely, but it is <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">possible</div>) that all scum are in the lurkers - and since this is possible, it's absurd to criticize someone for pushing on a lurker. <br>\n<br>\nIf you're criticizing me for voting denis for posting frequency while ignoring other lurkers, I felt like denis would be the kind of person who would strategically lurk. So I looked at meta, and found that it was a good place for my vote. I'm not voting him because \"he's a lurker and lurkers must die\" - I'm voting him because of the fact that it was <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">him</div> who was lurking. <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><br>\nYou don't explain town reads unless they're under significant pressure or asked?

I've got a decent number of townreads but a lot of nulls and few scumreads here, I think mostly a by-product of the fact that a decent number of people need to check back in and post some more content.

First few pages were pretty underwhelming for him, but his vote on chkflip in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4595975#p4595975\" class=\"postlink\">#69</a> backed up with the points of reasoning regarding his voting patterns and the follow-up pressure in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4600897#p4600897\" class=\"postlink\">#89</a> make a lot of sense and fit very much what I know of his town forum meta - push whatever he can to get the game going, even if it's just something he finds a little bit suspicious. His follow-up on Rob re: him asking ICE for non-RVS meta but not others is a great question, one that I had myself (see below). His switch away from chkflip and onto denis for strategically lurking, complete with the meta links and examination of the frequency of his posting is something that I think is very much unlikely to come from implosion as scum. In both games I specced with scum implosion, he either lurks hardcore (<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?t=22173&amp;f=56&amp;st=0&amp;sk=t&amp;sd=a&amp;user_select=14368&amp;user_select2=0&amp;user_select3=0&amp;user_sort=Go\" class=\"postlink\">Mafia Behind the Maiden</a>) or mainly just uses lazy/bullshit reasoning (<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?t=22453&amp;f=56&amp;st=0&amp;sk=t&amp;sd=a&amp;user_select=14368&amp;user_select2=0&amp;user_select3=0&amp;user_sort=Go\" class=\"postlink\">Otherworld</a>) and I'm not saying either of those flavors of implosion here. I also think implosion comes across as very genuine in the entire back-and-forth with Junpei, especially re: pushing lurkers due to PoE reasons and not out of opportunism.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">projectmatt:</div> Another player I don't really understand people suspecting as I think projectmatt's reactions are very town and I think he is playing massively to his town meta. His entrance into the game pushing a joke wagon on Denis in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4586992#p4586992\" class=\"postlink\">#16</a>-<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4587125#p4587125\" class=\"postlink\">#20</a> hits pretty much what I expected him to come in doing, I think he'd have been a lot more stiff and scripted as scum. The sarcastic reaction to ICEninja's vote, townreading him, and silent vote on Bub in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4590385#p4590385\" class=\"postlink\">#38</a> because he found Bub's entrance to be awkward (<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4595961#p4595961\" class=\"postlink\">#67</a>) and slightly scummy fits how I know he scumhunts to a tee. While I don't exactly agree that Bub is scummy at all (again, see below), there's an identifiable thought process with the vote that very much reads like a legitimate attempt to scumhunt. I also liked the way he held his ground in defending himself against ICEninja, particularly in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4595753#p4595753\" class=\"postlink\">#65</a>, as I think he'd have caved or retreated in some form as scum. I don't find the confidence in his townread on chkflip at all scummy given chkflip's reactions and it makes sense that they remind him of other games together. Also like his reads list in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4615476#p4615476\" class=\"postlink\">#197</a> but that's a pretty minor thing.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">chkflip:</div> The argument with projectmatt about matt's ability to read him as town was literally one of the dumbest fucking things I have ever read in a game of mafia. That being said, I'm 100% with implosion that he comes across like he's genuinely frustrated. The initial accusation that projectmatt couldn't possibly be able to townread him because he's almost always perceived as scummy in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4599396#p4599396\" class=\"postlink\">#83</a> is completely genuine and would be a frankly bizarre angle of attack for him to take as scum. And while his <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4603669#p4603669\" class=\"postlink\">#99</a> is really strained the fact that he goes through the effort of plowing through the games linked comes across like a legitimate attempt to test projectmatt's general ability to read him and I like him asking Bub to chime in on their interaction (<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4603964#p4603964\" class=\"postlink\">#102</a>). Do want to say, though, projectmatt being hypothetically wrong about his ability to read you doesn't necessarily mean he's lying, he could just be mistaken.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Bub Bidderskins:</div> I actually found his vote on Ion in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4586743#p4586743\" class=\"postlink\">#13</a> with the serious reasoning attached to be somewhat of a towntell as it reminds me of his early voting in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?t=23948&amp;f=2&amp;st=0&amp;sk=t&amp;sd=a&amp;user_select=12165&amp;user_select2=0&amp;user_select3=0&amp;user_sort=Go\" class=\"postlink\">Mini 1394</a> as town. Also liked his jump to voting projectmatt in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4592342#p4592342\" class=\"postlink\">#45</a> and his interpretation of matt's chkflip vote in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4603914#p4603914\" class=\"postlink\">#101</a>, while I don't agree with the conclusion there's a thought process going on here that I find natural. His analysis of the projectmatt/chkflip interaction in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4608972#p4608972\" class=\"postlink\">#131</a> and <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4614840#p4614840\" class=\"postlink\">#182</a> makes sense though I think it's a little naive (for example, it's certainly within the realm of possibility that a hypothetical projectmatt/chkflip scum duo would distance in this fashion given the overblown nature of their back and forth but I'm finding it unlikely given that I'm townreading both of them individually).<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Rob13:</div> Wasn't a big fan of his early posting initially regarding meta-checking ICE's RVS meta for a couple of reasons: 1) it felt like a super minor thing to ask about, and 2) he doesn't follow up on it with other players (specifically implosion, who deliberately refused to partake in RVS) and his line of inquiry regarding projectmatt's early joke posting seemed lame. However, I do agree that there seems to be a genuine conviction behind his scumhunting and I particularly liked the way he analyzed the projectmatt/chkflip interaction as scum on scum in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4610182#p4610182\" class=\"postlink\">#144</a> as I think it makes sense that he would find their interaction forced. Aside from that, nothing really caught my eye and I get the impression overall that Rob13's a newbie playing very rigidly not really scummy.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Lincolm:</div> Weakest townread here mostly due to the effort and level of depth he put into his reads list in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4615385#p4615385\" class=\"postlink\">#196</a>, which seems impressive to me with a player of his experience. However, I do want to ask one thing because it's really bugging me about him and I'm bolding it because it really needs answering: <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">What made you change your mind on Denis from saying you were sure he was pro-town (<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4613896#p4613896\" class=\"postlink\">#178</a>) to having him as a scumread (<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4615385#p4615385\" class=\"postlink\">#196</a>)?</div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">NULL:</div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">denisatp:</div> I don't find his early trolling, abrasive attitude, and early tracker claim to be particularly scummy and knowing him I think that's something that would come from Denis as either alignment really. I do want to see more of him and what he actually thinks, though.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">wam:</div> Nothing much here. I guess his voting chkflip for being a late bandwagon voter in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4589315#p4589315\" class=\"postlink\">#32</a> and <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4589621#p4589621\" class=\"postlink\">#34</a> makes sense but I don't think it's alignment indicative even for someone with his experience level.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Junpei:</div> Given my own assumption about his skill and his experience level, I think his entire back and forth with implosion and his scumreads on Denis/projectmatt is something he could plausibly do as both alignments. The points projectmatt brings up in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4615476#p4615476\" class=\"postlink\">#197</a> make sense, but I need to see some more from him to be able to actually gauge his alignment here.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">PeregrineV:</div> Having played with him once in the past (albeit in a hydra) and having followed some of his games, Pere can be tough to read since he tends to be pretty lurky/low content as both alignments. That being said, I don't like how he interprets the projectmatt/chkflip interaction in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4609581#p4609581\" class=\"postlink\">#139</a> by implying they could both be town (\"the exchange could be legit\") and then suggests that they could both be scum (\"if you step back and look at the topics of each post and paraphrase each one, sounds kind of fake\"). It feels like he's trying to assert a stance without actually doing so. Aside from that, I find that Pere gets easier to read as the game goes on since he tends to play a stronger town game than scum game (he struggles on what to say as scum).<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF0000\">SCUM (Strongest to Weakest):</div></div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Breakfast:</div> Hard to put a finger on what rubs me the wrong way about his ISO but if I had to articulate it, I'd say that a lot of his posting seems more intended to cast suspicions on people rather than an attempt to analyze their motivations. For example: the accusation that Rob's \"putting words in [projectmatt's] mouth\" (<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4597800#p4597800\" class=\"postlink\">#78</a>), the accusation that Bub is \"contradicting himself\" and the idea that chkflip comes off as scummier in the exchange between himself and projectmatt (<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4613069#p4613069\" class=\"postlink\">#175</a>) - the way the latter opinion is phrased comes across like he's opportunistically scumreading chkflip while also opening himself up to a possible projectmatt wagon if it arises. The vote on implosion in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4615348#p4615348\" class=\"postlink\">#195</a> feels like he's stretching for reasons for the vote. Also, his notion of leaving a \"coinflip lynch\" like Denis until lylo (<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4612953#p4612953\" class=\"postlink\">#172</a>) makes zero sense.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Ion67:</div> Weak read here, but I really didn't like <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4612802#p4612802\" class=\"postlink\">#171</a> at all - I think the way he tries to cast suspicion on Denis comes off as forced and his interpretation of the projectmatt/chflip interaction feels lazy and strained.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Unvote, vote: Breakfast</div>", "time": "Fri Jan 04, 2013 5:33 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=24645&start=175", "forum": "53", "thread": "24645"}

If he's town and seriously claiming town PR with no pressure on him just because he's a \"shit-poster\", which basically means he's a troll, then he's deliberately playing against his wincon with that claim. I'm not going to assume that because that would assume that denis is breaking site rules, which is not an assumption I'm willing to make about any player. Call me optimistic, but I'd like to assume that everyone's playing towards their wincon. The site rules are supposed to allow that assumption.<br>\n<br>\nThe reason why I feel I need to make this assumption is because if I do not, then I can't read anyone.

I think you're performing a gambit in which you're attempting to play so horribly anti-town on purpose so that people start dismissing every scummy thing that you do and chalk you up as noob-town or idiot-town. I've reached this conclusion because there is no possible town motivation to what you've done. The fact that you've admitted to an outright lie makes it much more likely that you're lying all over the place as part of your gambit.<br>\n<br>\nWhy would you lie about your motivations for claiming as town?

That actually doesn't matter since my first reason which was more of a theoretical reason still applies. \"if you were town, your actual motivations would speak for themselves as town-like?\" if town's motivations automatically spoke as town-like then there would be no such thing as the game of mafia.

This despite the fact you yourself have spent a good portion of today with denis as a scum read.  Could you please explain?  Link to the post where you changed you mind on denis perhaps?<br>\n <br>\nI hate self-votes.  Hate &#8216;em. <br>\n<br>\nAnd I see RayFrost uses the same stream of consciousness catch up that people despise when I give.  Bravo.  <br>\n<br>\nWhat Imp/matt connections are people referring to?<br>\n <br>\nThe content from wam and Breakfast is pathetic&#8230;though wam at least has the unfortunate excuse of a ridiculously long replace-out worthy v/LA.  Ion and Bub also underposting I see.  Of these underposters I&#8217;m probably the most suspicious of Breakfast but with all the other content in the game&#8230;I hate to vote someone who is probably headed for replacement soon.   (Edit...I see Breakfast has been replaced so I'd like to see what HD can contribute).<br>\n <br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Summary</div>&#8230;I don't like any of the wagons now that Breakfast is gone.  If there is a good case on Rob I do not recall it.  chkflp was making my radar ping a bit earlier in the game but for the most part (aside from my observation above) I'm leaning town on him (I think mostly due to his outburst).  I think Empire is probably town.  I'm most interested in a Matt lynch.  I do not care for denis's play but I think the claim deserves a night to play out (plus as I said earlier...I think the unnecessary claim is more likely from bad town than scum).  There are really a lot of slots that are lacking material so I'm pretty confident there's scum among them (wam, HD, Ion, lincolm, Ray and to a somewhat lesser degree Junpei and Bub).<br>\n<br>\nCaught up.<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: projectmatt</span>", "time": "Tue Jan 08, 2013 4:46 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=24645&start=350", "forum": "53", "thread": "24645"}

This despite the fact you yourself have spent a good portion of today with denis as a scum read.  Could you please explain?  Link to the post where you changed you mind on denis perhaps?<br>\n <br>\nI hate self-votes.  Hate &#8216;em. <br>\n<br>\nAnd I see RayFrost uses the same stream of consciousness catch up that people despise when I give.  Bravo.  <br>\n<br>\nWhat Imp/matt connections are people referring to?<br>\n <br>\nThe content from wam and Breakfast is pathetic&#8230;though wam at least has the unfortunate excuse of a ridiculously long replace-out worthy v/LA.  Ion and Bub also underposting I see.  Of these underposters I&#8217;m probably the most suspicious of Breakfast but with all the other content in the game&#8230;I hate to vote someone who is probably headed for replacement soon.   (Edit...I see Breakfast has been replaced so I'd like to see what HD can contribute).<br>\n <br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Summary</div>&#8230;I don't like any of the wagons now that Breakfast is gone.  If there is a good case on Rob I do not recall it.  chkflp was making my radar ping a bit earlier in the game but for the most part (aside from my observation above) I'm leaning town on him (I think mostly due to his outburst).  I think Empire is probably town.  I'm most interested in a Matt lynch.  I do not care for denis's play but I think the claim deserves a night to play out (plus as I said earlier...I think the unnecessary claim is more likely from bad town than scum).  There are really a lot of slots that are lacking material so I'm pretty confident there's scum among them (wam, HD, Ion, lincolm, Ray and to a somewhat lesser degree Junpei and Bub).<br>\n<br>\nCaught up.<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: projectmatt</span></div></blockquote><br>\nokay thanks for telling me something that we already established.", "time": "Tue Jan 08, 2013 5:26 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=24645&start=350", "forum": "53", "thread": "24645"}

Having a scumread on a player who is town is NOT something that is a scumtell. It can be, under certain circumstances, but in general if a town votes another town, it doesn ot mean everyone on my wagon is mafia. that \"you are probably town\" comment was at ICEninja, BTW, not Denis, which kind of proves you literally just skimmed through my ISO to incriminate me for anything.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>In Post 46 you tell Rob you won't attack a town read (is Rob a town read for you?) but you will \"explain why their logic is bad,\"...however; you aren't explaining why his logic is bad. You're just asking a question already asked by Ice. Comes across as trying to look like you are scumhunting. And you excuse it by saying to forgot Ice had asked Rob about meta'ing him [Ice]. This despite the fact Ice had asked Rob only two posts early...so you forgot in the span of two posts which I would assume you have read prior to your Post 46 as it was so recent.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nI <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">did</div> explain why the logic was bad.

A test in the sense that while I was mainly messing around with Denis, I wanted to see both his and other's reactions. It's pathetic that people are contemplating pushing on me due to a joke on the first page of the entire game. The results? I did out my \"results\" in the sense that Ice and Rob's reactions gave me quite a lot to read into. I don't say that it's something that's magical but on page 1 it's perfectly fine.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>In Post 65 Matt asks chkflp for his reason in voting him [Matt] despite the fact he [Matt] just got done telling Bub a page earlier that he [Matt] didn't need to give him [Bub] a reason for voting him [Bub]. So he doesn't want to give others reasons they can defend themselves against but at the same time he wants to know the reasons being used against him for what I can only assume is to defend himself against. So vague and defensive at the same time. He then of course gives his (weak) vote rational on Bub in his own defense of suspicions raised by Ice.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nTell me how my rational was weak. Do it. Of course I want to know other's logic but if I want to conceal a reasoning for a read so I can see, once again, how Bub would respond to it that's perfectly fine. <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>More joking with denis. What a special relationship. Why do you keep joking and then using it as a negative when people take you seriously? Was Post 70 for a reaction as well?

While he didn't blatantly say, \"We should believe Denis!\"  He did state that he would like to wait to lynch him until LYLO.

I've played with players who, as Mafia, like to do stupid things such as that just because they still think that they can win - and, when/if they do, love to rub it in people's faces.  I've actually played with a player on a different website who, during Day 1, came right out and said that he was the Mafia Godfather.  He ended up surviving to endgame and actually was Godfather.<br>\n<br>\nHowever, when he \"claimed\" it, he openly stated that he was joking.  I believe Denis to be doing the exact same thing, he's just much worse at it - especially by saying his claim was serious.<br>\n<br>\nI sincerely apologize, but at the current moment a list of reads right now would be completely biased by the sole fact of what I have discovered.  I would literally be measuring every single person based solely on their interactions with Denis.  I'll give a complete set of reads Day 3.<br>\n<br>\nAs for my Mafia experience, while not expansive I do have some.  Off of this site, I've played a couple games, but not many.

The only way I could see mafia targeting you is if they had a strongman (in which case you would be dead, so this is no longer possible) or if they had a role-blocker. If they have a different PR (such as Role Cop), then they would have no need to target you with their PR and they still wouldn't kill you because you'd likely be protected.

If you agree to this, I will remove my vote.  I only placed it because I saw growing scum-motivation behind your actions.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nThis is the scummiest post in this game right now, hands down. Several reasons:<br>\n<br>\nFirst of all, you assume that scum has no motivation to stop the wagon of a townie. Not true. If you do it right, it could lead everyone to believe you're town. Sacrificing one easy mislynch to move up to near the top of everyone's \"town\" list? Scum would do that in a heartbeat if they thought it would work. You could also perform these actions in an attempt to get denis lynched (a better lynchee in the scum's eyes by virtue of his PR), attempt to out additional PRs (guess what happened!), OR defend your scum partner (Fitz). All of these are possible motivations for your actions by scum. Suggesting that you would only ever commit the actions you did if Fitz was your partner is facetious.<br>\n<br>\nNext, you're trying to say that Fitz can in no way be your scum partner because it's improbable that Denis hit the remaining mafia goon with a randomly targeted PR action. First, his action wasn't random, so that's untrue. Denis targeted the person he thought was the most scummy. Second, just because it's improbable doesn't make it impossible.<br>\n<br>\nYou go on to try to put yourself and Fitz as a package deal. This bothers me significantly. One of you flipping one alignment doesn't confirm the other either way, especially you flipping town. How does you flipping town confirm Fitz as town? Please explain that to me, because I think that's rather blatantly untrue. If you see some logic in that, then I certainly don't. I don't think there's any there.<br>\n<br>\nAnd to top off everything, the conclusion of your post is an attempt to bargain with me to stop looking your way. You try to convince me to stop engaging you and look elsewhere in exchange for getting a vote off of me. So, so scummy. Town doesn't use their vote as a bargaining chip to remove pressure from themselves. There is no town motivation for what you're trying to do here.", "time": "Thu Jan 17, 2013 12:56 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=24645&start=575", "forum": "53", "thread": "24645"}

Result: Scum-Rob wins hands down.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Junpei</div>, considering the post directly involves him it makes it a little harder to analyze.  IMO, town-Junpei, but he would try to turn against both Matt and myself AND include the possibility that I'm scum and simply buddying, which he did.  Scum-Junpei probably would have just tried to implicate me only because attempting to implicate both of us might put some of the attention towards Matt too.  Why try to drag another townie into the argument when all you really need is his vote?  Result: Null-Town.<br>\n<br>\nThe third person in this scenario was Matt, but he hasn't responded yet - but since you called me out on it before he had a chance to post he'll be exempt from this test.

I guess I just never mentioned the two in the same post before - fair enough.  I didn't believe his claim (since it was literally brought out of nowhere and I saw him as scummy) AND I was confirming it.  However, there is absolutely nothing in the above two quotes that is a lie nor do they contradict each other.  Notice how in the second post you quoted I didn't specifically say a reason as to why I targeted Denis - because I had already said why.

However, when I ISO'd HD, I found the post where he said, <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">\"Does anyone actually believe Denis' Tracker claim?\"</div>  That led me to believe that the issue was still up in the air and hadn't been addressed at at.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Finally, the fact that you didn't answer every point against you fully is enough to use the same reasoning you used against me for not answering all of your points.

However, it was also AFTER I had just presented a case against Junpei and how I think he's scum.  Up to that point, both you and Junpei had many posts regarding me as scum, therefore...<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Rob</div>, if you were town and you were scum-hunting, you should feel as though you have already made quite a large case against me and should feel very comfortable in what you've stated so far.  IMO, town-Rob - since the post itself doesn't concern him at all, would have ignored it whereas scum-Rob simply sees it as more ammo for his cannon, so why not try to dump that on me too?  Take note that Rob hasn't tried to implicate Matt in anyway as a result of that post - only me.  It's important.  Result: Scum-Rob wins hands down.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Junpei</div>, considering the post directly involves him it makes it a little harder to analyze.  IMO, town-Junpei, but he would try to turn against both Matt and myself AND include the possibility that I'm scum and simply buddying, which he did.  Scum-Junpei probably would have just tried to implicate me only because attempting to implicate both of us might put some of the attention towards Matt too.  Why try to drag another townie into the argument when all you really need is his vote?  Result: Null-Town.<br>\n<br>\nThe third person in this scenario was Matt, but he hasn't responded yet - but since you called me out on it before he had a chance to post he'll be exempt from this test.  Both versions of Matt probably would have tried to distance in at least someway.  The harder the attempt at distancing, the more scummy IMO.<br>\n<br>\nThe question about not voting him still stands though.  I really want to know the answer.<br>\n<br>\nI do have another question for you, Rob.

When Day 2 started, I didn't get a chance to pop in until Fitz was already at L-1 - which sent me into a little bit of a panic since I had some pretty hard evidence suggesting that he was lying.<br>\n<br>\nI went back to the posts I had written down after the threat of an immediate lynch was gone and all discussions for the day were already killed.</div></blockquote><br>\nYou keep adding details to this story and I don't buy it. So let me get this straight, here's what you're saying happened:<br>\n<br>\nYou decided to target denis because of the claim<br>\nyou still hadn't read up<br>\nyou start to read and find denis to be very scummy<br>\nday starts<br>\nwhen you claim you post why denis is scummy, but not anything about confirming his claim at first</div></blockquote><br>\nIMO, I had already confirmed his claim.  I didn't feel the need to mention anything about my intention of confirming his claim until it was asked of me.  IMO, I had caught a scum and he was about to be lynched because of it.  I'll admit, I was very giddy and excited when I thought that I was going to replace into a game as a Town PR and <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">instantly</div> catch a scum - that is, until Rob came in and dashed my hopes all over a rocky out-cropping at the bottom of a cliff.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Issues:<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4639764#p4639764\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4639764#p4639764\" data-post-id=\"4639764\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 474</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=20125\">ThunderHog</a> wrote:</cite>The reason I targeted Denis was because I didn't believe his claim</div></blockquote><br>\nThat is self explanatory.<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4640083#p4640083\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4640083#p4640083\" data-post-id=\"4640083\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 494</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=20125\">ThunderHog</a> wrote:</cite>The way I saw it, I was confirming his claim.  He was the only townie to make even make as much as a soft-claim to a PR - therefore, I found him the most likely target of a Mafia Nightkill.

I guess I just never mentioned the two in the same post before - fair enough.  I didn't believe his claim (since it was literally brought out of nowhere and I saw him as scummy) AND I was confirming it.  However, there is absolutely nothing in the above two quotes that is a lie nor do they contradict each other.  Notice how in the second post you quoted I didn't specifically say a reason as to why I targeted Denis - because I had already said why.  Just because I don't believe his claim doesn't mean he's lying, which is why I wanted to confirm it.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>According to this timeline you stopped reading after page 8 and decided to target someone for a claim on page 6. A normal townie would keep reading to make sure that the claim was legitimate and that there weren't any other claims or anything else he had to be aware of. All you did was ISO the dead and post. In fact at the time of your claim you still show nothing that says you're caught up.<br>\nYou make two posts about denis' behavior being scum before making a post about how that's not your reasoning (AFTER I say that your reasoning sucks)</div></blockquote><br>\nUnder normal circumstances, you'd be absolutely right.  However, when I ISO'd HD, I found the post where he said, <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">\"Does anyone actually believe Denis' Tracker claim?\"</div>  That led me to believe that the issue was still up in the air and hadn't been addressed at at.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Finally, the fact that you didn't answer every point against you fully is enough to use the same reasoning you used against me for not answering all of your points. So I demand that you go back and double check to make sure you answered every point against you, just like I just did.</div></blockquote><br>\nA little aggressive there, but I will check right now...<br>\n<br>\nYa know, I had literally thought that I had got everything and I was simply checking as a good gesture to you since you had been so kind to do it for me - but I actually did find something, but first just to get everything else out of the way:<br>\n<br>\n - Your posts 501 and 508 were addressed by me in post 529.<br>\n - Your post 534, while it apparently took me awhile, was addressed in post 602.<br>\n<br>\nHere's what I missed - we had a little back and forth going for a little while here.<br>\n<br>\n - Your post 563, addressed in 565, your post 566, addressed 569, your post 576, addressed 582; however you're next two posts 583 and 584 I seemed to have missed.

Apologize in advance if it's kind of rambly, it's early and I haven't slept much.<br>\n<br>\nRight so I'm still not entirely sure what's going on with the PR claims, only thing I'm able to parse out at the moment is that if Rob is real I think a Godfather being in this setup is very unlikely - having a role that's completely immune to cop investigations exist to balance against a 1-Shot Cop seems like overkill to me. This means, therefore, that Denis is more likely to be town I think - the only way he's scum is if he's partnered up with Rob since Rob being real necessarily means that Denis is town if my assumption about the setup is correct. I'm also reading Rob as town too so I'm willing to write both of them as town right now. I also have a strong townread on Lincolm, especially after his claim which I felt was super genuine (e.g., the hesitation in outing Rob, an unclaimed PR at the time + Rob confirming his visit which would mean Lincolm would have to be extremely lucky to guess that as scum and that's a gambit I don't think he's likely to pull).<br>\n<br>\nThis leaves ThunderHog. Though I think it's possible all 4 PRs are real, I've found TH's posts to be pretty scummy and I think both Junpei/Rob come off better in their back-and-forth. I found myself agreeing with Rob in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4650409#p4650409\" class=\"postlink\">#585</a> that TH bargaining with his vote in that fashion was really terrible and it just reads like he's trying to intimidate someone off the wagon or try and deflect suspicion away from himself. I also found his claim to be \"reaction testing\" Junpei/Rob in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4655651#p4655651\" class=\"postlink\">#609</a> to be pretty BS and it just feels like a backpedal response more than anything once Junpei called him out on it. I also find the way he's shifted his read on Junpei from finding him scum to finding him somewhat townish to be pretty shitty too, reads like he's just trying to appease Junpei rather than from a natural progression.<br>\n<br>\nI'm fine with hammering him once everyone's fully caught up. I specifically want to hear DV's and Master Mew's thoughts once they finish reading the whole thread.<br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\nOne thing that I think also needs to be considered is the chkflip kill.

Take a look at my meta (I have all of my games on my wiki-page).<br>\n<br>\n - The first game I was in, I actually was scum - however, it was blatantly obvious and I was fairly easily lynched Day 2 (the only reason scum won that game was because of our Mod here - CD was my partner, and that's actually why I'm currently in this game).<br>\n<br>\n - Second game I was VT, and I was lynched Day 1 AND very quickly cuz scum hounded me to death.  Go ahead and look, Thor even said so himself.  Lol.<br>\n<br>\n - Third game, a large-theme game, I was still lynched Day 1 cuz I was appearing horribly scummy (actually was scum there too).<br>\n<br>\nMy track record of being lynched is actually rather hilarious.  Considering that this is MY first day in this game, and I'm about to get lynched here too.

WTF?<br>\n<br>\nOK...done.<br>\n<br>\nWhere does that leave me?  I still have suspicions towards Junpei.  They seemed to grow as the game progressed but then some of his points towards Thunder make sense and Thunder's play has seemed a bit flailing lately.  Probably the main reason I maintain suspicion towards Junpei is how quick he was to join my wagon after denis' lying claim result.  I got to L-1 quickly (understandly based on denis' lie....but scum would have known a) denis was lying and b) that he had been blocked.  So one of two things (or both) could have happened.  Scum could have hopped onto my wagon knowing it was going to be an easy mislynch that would lead most likely to denis' demise the following day AND/OR...scum could go for tons of town cred and just claim to have \"jailkept\" denis (essentially the same as roleblocking) and coasted to the end. <br>\n<br>\nOf the first circumstance...if there is going to be scum on my wagon I think it is most likely to be Junpei because, correct me if I am wrong, but denis is confirmed town given all the claim results; Lincolm is close to confirmed town (unless he and Rob are scum gambitting out their arses, which I do not see happening); Rob's claim seems legit and Empire has just been a stronger town read most of the game.  So PoE points to Junpei.  Though...all of them (except for denis) voted HD too so for someone on my L-1 wagon to be scum...they'd have had to of bussed HD...which is perfectly reasonable given his play.<br>\nI don't see my Junpei wagon getting anywhere so I'm cool with a Thunder lynch. <br>\n <br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: </span><br>\n <br>\nIt looks like several people are willing to hammer but it would still be good to hear Deasvail and Lincolm's thoughts first.

Well, chkflip's ISO really like a PR try to hide his PR with his VT claim and Denis really like VT fake-claiming (if Denis is town) in day 1. Other case, maybe mafia tried to kill Denis but failed, and the vig or SK killed chkflip. But vig killed chkflip? Really, I can't understand why.

All of my arguments from your own post. You are too sure that Denis is a town-tracker and ThunderHog is a Jailkeeper with version that when he jail someone, another person target ThunderHog's target, the person gain result. Blame yourself.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nFirst, that's not a defense. That's me questioning why you're attacking me in ways that cannot in any way be construed to be pro-town. You're twisting my words and utilizing evidence selectively and out of context in such a way that you're attempting to <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">show that my slot is scum</div> rather than <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">determine if my slot is scum.</div> You have a pre-conceived conclusion that I am scum and am trying to frantically support it with evidence. The result is looking very scummy. The only reason I didn't vote you earlier is because I think a Mafia 1-Shot Watcher is kind of an odd role, but I have to rethink that now.<br>\n<br>\nSecond, you just literally recapped your case from like two to three posts ago that I already responded to and refuted like it was new shit that hasn't been already torn apart as ludicrous. You didn't bother to address any of my responses in this simplified version of your incredibly flawed argument, nor did you complicate the argument based on my responses. You'd rather just ignore everything I'm saying because if you can convince everyone to shove their hands over their ears and scream \"lalalalalalala,\" then you can get an easy mislynch off of me. I'm not going down without pointing out how you're scum first.<br>\n<br>\nHere's my thoughts. I gave way too much credibility to Lincolm's claim. I assumed that the fact that he is a confirmed Watcher based on his results also makes him a confirmed town member. That's not necessarily true, and indeed it is unlikely the more I think about it. Putting a cop, a watcher, and a tracker all in the same setup is kind of overkill. They're all investigative roles and even with X-shot modifications, it seems like it gives too high of a probability that scum (possibly multiple scum, if there is a scum PR - which is extremely likely) would be caught Day 1. On the other hand, a scum watcher would be a pretty good thing to balance out the investigative roles of cop and tracker (as well as other town PRs). It could help find and neutralize town PRs faster.<br>\n<br>\nBased on his recent play and the anti-town manner in which he is composing his case on me:<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Unvote<br>\nVote Lincolm</div>", "time": "Mon Jan 28, 2013 10:46 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=24645&start=750", "forum": "53", "thread": "24645"}

If there's only a single scum-faction (which the scum would more-or-less know after only one NK the night before), then they can safely claim Town Jailkeeper with literally no way for the town to verify that they're fake-claiming provided they never target the same person that their own scum-team targets (which they could, of course, ensure never happened). For these reasons, I thought the following:<br>\n<br>\n1. TH's claim did NOT clear him in any way because it was a good scum-claim for a Mafia Roleblocker given the situation. My reasoning for this was very similar to Bub's re:me about the 1-shot cop claim. An important difference between my and Bub's thinking is that while I only concluded that TH's claim did not confirm him, Bub concluded that my claim actually made me scummy, which I still don't see the sense in.<br>\n<br>\n2. While TH's claim did NOT confirm alignment, it DID confirm role (either JK or Roleblocker).<br>\n<br>\n3. I should evaluate TH based on his play and more-or-less not factor in the claim because it didn't clear him.<br>\n<br>\nTH's play was scummy, as I highlighted throughout Day 2, so I concluded that he was scum.

The number one thing that scum are trying to do is look like town. If they convince everyone in the game that they're town, then they've won because they'll never be lynched. Think of it this way. Would scum rather have ONE mislynch or a greatly decreased likelihood of being lynched themselves in all future days AND a possibility of still mislynching today? As scum, I'd take the second option hands down. No contest.<br>\n<br>\nAlso, I specifically stated that TH could be trying to get denis mislynched when I was talking about PRs in that post. That was a PR that was already claimed and known by Day 2. This is another reason, by the way, that TH could have had motivation to stop the wagon. He could have been trying to go for the PR mislynch over the easier unknown mislynch because removing a PR increases his chances of winning. Obviously I know this now to be untrue, but I believed it not only possible but probable in Day 2. I stand by my thought process.

Please clarify.<br>\n<br>\nHis case on Junpei was downright pathetic. Here's some of the many issues with it.<br>\n<br>\n1. He criticizes Junpei for not sticking with a vote on Denis for the gambit DESPITE the fact that I announced an innocent on denis, which would clearly make any sensible person take their vote off denis.<br>\n<br>\n2. Criticizes Junpei for earlier in the day calling him \"least likely to be mafia\" out of the role claims. Ignores the fact that shit happens and reads change to respond to it. Welcome to the game of Mafia, TH!<br>\n<br>\n3. Continuously complains about Junpei \"discrediting\" him when in fact Junpei was just disagreeing with him or arguing that he was scummy. Is that a form of discrediting? Maybe. Is it scummy? No - it's normal in Mafia. Does it belong in a case on why Junpei is scum? lolno.<br>\n<br>\n4. Almost all points used as evidence of Junpei being scum are points in which Junpei was arguing that TH was possibly (and later probably) scum. Gave the whole case an OMGUS taste to it.<br>\n<br>\nP-edit:<br>\n<br>\nThat was a bad post. Scum that are down to two people on Day 2 are not likely to be super active and aggressive in my opinion, especially when they know that the lynch they're pushing is (necessarily) going to be a mislynch. Why would they want to be the poster-boy to the mislynch of a town PR? That makes very little (no?) sense. Also, I do not understand how you think that confusion = town with regards to PR stuff. I similarly do not understand how you think Mew or DV were confused about the town PR stuff. I saw no evidence of that. Please give an example. Lastly, if you think that there is a scum amongst the claimed PRs, which you do at the moment, then why do you think the people ignoring the claimed PRs are town? Isn't that counter-intuitive? If someone's scum-partner fake-claimed, wouldn't they want to draw as little attention towards the claim as possible? Your thought process on this doesn't make much sense.", "time": "Mon Feb 04, 2013 3:16 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=24645&start=850", "forum": "53", "thread": "24645"}

{"number": 861, "id": "4698064", "user": "havingfitz", "user_id": "11821", "content": "OK...this game is dragging ass. The longer it remains stagnant the more likely we are to get a rushed lynch at deadline (and it would probably be a mislynch).<br>\n<br>\nHere are my thoughts on the game....<br>\n<br>\nRob is the days frontrunner due to a strong push by Bub and a somewhat strong push by Lincolm. The longer the day goes on the more the case on Rob seems to come apart, be shown to not exist, or be based on WIFOM. Assessment - Rob could be scum but is by no means a slam dunk.<br>\n<br>\nWe could get into set up speculation but that IMO seems to usually favor scum. Giving personal experience with certain set ups is ok I guess (especially considering I did some earlier with my views towards having a watcher and tracker in the same game) but otherwise I don't put a lot of weight into it.<br>\n<br>\nLincolm is confirmed town unless people want to consider the possibility of him being a Mafia watcher. I doubt this is the case if he was a Mafia watcher there would have been no need to provide his results on Thunder and Rob. He would know what their alignments were and scum could have just saved them for NKs. So IMO Lincolm is town.<br>\n<br>\nNow that we know Thunder was a mislynch I think it is reasonable to expect there to be at least one scum on his wagon. However...if there was a case for a wagon that had NO scum on it...Thunder's would qualify. Aside from the brief amount of time I had a wagon (because of denis's lying claim on me) there was really no one else really generating a counter wagon to Thunder. So I think VCA holds little weight up to this point.<br>\n<br>\nEveryone probably warrants a certain amount of suspicions towards them. Several lurky types (especially today) and some new players who's predecessors gained some suspicion.<br>\n<br>\nIf I wasn't going to vote Rob today I think my three frontrunners for a vote would be Matt, N, Bub or Mew. N and Mew moreso based on their predecessors; Bub based on his speculative push towards Rob (so Rob's flip <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">could</div> clear Bub &amp; vice-versa); and Matt.<br>\n<br>\nRegarding Matt. I had a good deal of <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4627236#p4627236\">suspicions towards him on D1</a> that I let slide on D2 and beyond due to his push on scum (HD) D1. The denis fakeclaim + Rob:Thunder debates put Matt out of mind for me on D2, along with the early buzz today around Rob. However...as the Rob wagon starts to wane a bit a closer look at Matt makes me question my earlier pardon of him. I asked Matt if he had any previous scum games earlier today and rather than have him feed them to me...once he said there were some I went looking. And in the two most significant (IMO) scum games he had (Open 391 and Open 322) he bussed heavily. In 391 he bussed both his partners (to no avail) and in 322 he bussed his way to victory. He even apologized to his partner later for bussing him so hard on D1. So in this game...Matt's actions towards HD (who quite honestly sucked as scum and therefore probably has at least one and conceivably both of his partners on his wagon) upon further review...by no means clear him and in fact, shine some additional suspicion on him. That coupled with the fact since he unvoted chkflp on page 5...the only vote Matt has had in play the entire game was on HD on D1. He [Matt] hasn't had a vote out since D1. Nothing all of D2 and nothing yet today. And whereas he was one of the most active posters on D1, he has significantly dropped in his contribution level to the game on D2 and D3.<br>\n<br>\nI'm back to thinking Matt is scum (where I had my vote at the end of D1) and he has just lurked behind all the other activity the last two days.<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Matt</span>", "time": "Tue Feb 05, 2013 2:47 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=24645&start=850", "forum": "53", "thread": "24645"}

Compared to the previous day where, if I recall correctly, Rob's opinion was something like \"Denis is not playing to his win con whether town or scum, but I think he very well could be scum\", 490 leaves no possibility for Denis to be scum. Rob says that he thought Denis could be lying town, which would make him 'that guy'. And then says without reservation that Denis is 'that guy'. Does Rob think he could be scum anymore? Obviously not.<br>\n<br>\nNow I don't think it's that likely that Rob could have been planning to claim cop at that stage, so despite his claim being forced by Lincolm's watch, I think that the above supports it. However, a possibility has occurred to me that he is a role cop and found out Denis was actually a tracker and decided to back off. I don't know if this is what happened. I don't think it's <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">that</div> likely that Rob-scum is a role cop who would act that way as scum in that situation, but it is possible. What really annoys me though, is that apart from Lincolm, no one really has attempted to help me explain this or even really shown that they care about the possibility that Rob is in fact a town 1-Shot Cop. Bub is an example, saying that people should lynch Bub, but doing nothing to actually make it happen, when I've made pretty clear in my posts what would most likely get me to lynch Rob.

Not to say that ICE hasn't - but think about it this way. The fight between matt and chk consists of two sets of interactions - matt's actions towards chk, and chk's towards matt. If matt is town, then his interactions towards chk are going to be the same whether chk is town or scum - thus, it is impossible to distinguish between mattTown-chkTown and mattTown-chkScum <div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">based only on their interactions.</div> Likewise, it is impossible to distinguish between mattTown-chkTown and mattScum-chkTown. Ergo, the only situation that can be distinguished from TvT <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">solely based on their interactions</div> is SvS - that is to say that their interactions <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">as a whole</div> cannot be used as a tell that would rule out TvT. It would be a legitimate argument to say \"matt's actions towards chkflip look like scum -&gt; town to me\" or \"chk's actions towards matt look like scum -&gt; town to me\", but to say \"this fight doesn't look like TvT to me\" without specifying how exactly it isn't TvT is just bullshit. Townies do it, which is sad, but it's a stupid argument - it's one of those things which is usually based entirely on gut without anything to back it up logically. Gut is fine, but it has to have some (at least vague or tenuous) basis in logic.</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\nchk looks townier than he did after the fight with projectmatt - specifically, i think I'm just misconstruing bad play as scummy.

Rob feels scummy to me, and even the thing that makes me think he's a cop doesn't seem quite right. However, I just don't see why he'd be in \"Denis is town\" mode otherwise.<br>\n<br>\nImplosion's posts seem like town to me (especially the one I quoted earlier) and although Fitz isn't all that town-looking to me, I think that some of his posts are more extensive than would be expected from scum not under much pressure, and I don't think I find him anymore scummy than when I've seen him as town. So, I'm willing to just go with my implosion read there.<br>\n<br>\nWith Bub, a lot of his thoughts were exactly what I was thinking as I was reading through. I think this gives him very mild townpoints at most though. The main thing for me was that the jump onto the Thunder wagon (after previously defending him) came at a time that I think was very unlikely from scum considering that, if I recall correctly, Thunder was very much the likely lynch there.<br>\n<br>\nJunpei, I would probably consider, but I think Mew's play, although possible from town, displays qualities that are more likely from scum. The problem though, is that Rob's defence of him is scummy too, as I think the whole \"every newbie is like that\" thing is very exaggerated as it's not something that I've seen at all. I could totally see this situation as Rob-scum, Mew-town as well. (I tend to think too obvious to be scumbuddies in these kinds of situations)<br>\n<br>\nOh, and I forgot about PMatt.

I looked over his ISO just now and he seemed to push two wagons primarily (Rob and projectmatt, the latter being mostly an early game push). I initially thought that scum were just being careless but thinking back it seems to have been a calculated decision. Suppose that Rob is something like a mafia rolecop - maybe he didn't buy denis's claim and wanted to check him to be sure and preferred to take out one of the few people who suspected him D1.<br>\n<br>\nI get the idea that Rob was \"softing\" his report early D2 but I'm not so sure that's the case. Consider what Bub pointed out in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4677374#p4677374\" class=\"postlink\">this post</a> and Rob's justification <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4677424#p4677424\" class=\"postlink\">here</a>. Reading over that Denis/Rob interaction again, it doesn't really make sense as a \"normal' interaction as Rob put it. I know it's been pointed out but the way that line Bub quoted is phrased makes it seem like it's designed to make Denis look bad and the justification for it doesn't make sense to me - like, what kind of information could you possibly gain from that? And furthermore, Rob's response to me <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4685035#p4685035\" class=\"postlink\">here</a> feels off. He's already decided Bub is town so what would be the point of trying to gauge his reaction here?

It's pretty late here so sorry if this all sounds jumbled; this will be covering some stuff DV hasn't already mentioned.<br>\n<br>\nBreakfast asks Junpei a completely throwaway question in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4615348#p4615348\" class=\"postlink\">#195</a> that he never follows up on even after Junpei provides an answer in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4616089#p4616089\" class=\"postlink\">#199</a>. Junpei's first mention of Rob is in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4618893#p4618893\" class=\"postlink\">#218</a> where he criticizes him for posting fluff but Junpei never follows up on this at all even when he claims he will (e.g., \"Will have to take a closer look at you\"). However, their back and forth regarding Denis' claim seems strange as partner-type stuff given something like <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4620035#p4620035\" class=\"postlink\">#249</a> + <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4620054#p4620054\" class=\"postlink\">#253</a>, where Junpei almost comes off like he's trying to discredit Rob's view of Denis' tracker claim. I'm not so sure I agree with DV that, at least on his end, Junpei doesn't appear to be trying to get a read on Rob -- I think their back and forths on Denis' claim and Rob's read on chkflip, Junpei approaches the conversation with a degree of skepticism that comes off like he's trying to get a read on Rob. I do dislike that there's nothing definitive there, though. And I also don't like Junpei's hammer vote in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4632644#p4632644\" class=\"postlink\">#444</a> for the reasons I already mentioned.<br>\n<br>\nBut Rob being persuaded by Junpei's mini-case in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4622739#p4622739\" class=\"postlink\">#307</a> + later complimenting Junpei on his analysis in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4642380#p4642380\" class=\"postlink\">#544</a> gives me the impression that Rob was trying to capitalize on a misguided townie's reads. DV's point about Junpei and Rob simultaneously pushing the TH as a team seems weird too.<br>\n<br>\nBasically, I'm not as confident in N's slot being scum as I once was coming into this day. One thing to note though: the Bub kill seems to come from someone who wasn't paying too much attention to the game (e.g, missing that Lincolm was a claimed PR and basically clear) so that kill could very well have come from N.", "time": "Wed Feb 20, 2013 9:00 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=24645&start=975", "forum": "53", "thread": "24645"}

Not to say that ICE hasn't - but think about it this way. The fight between matt and chk consists of two sets of interactions - matt's actions towards chk, and chk's towards matt.

Townies do it, which is sad, but it's a stupid argument - it's one of those things which is usually based entirely on gut without anything to back it up logically.

I really just don't see why he would kind of make another town be against him as scum.<br>\n<br>\nAlso, his analysis of Denis's scumgame is a pretty bold thing for scum to look for and I feel like that kind of dedication to realistic logic is play that is generally not found in Implosions's scumgame.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4609509#p4609509\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4609509#p4609509\" data-post-id=\"4609509\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 135</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=14368\">implosion</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4608647#p4608647\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4608647#p4608647\" data-post-id=\"4608647\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 129</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=19999\">Rob14</a> wrote:</cite>This seals the deal on me thinking that matt v chkflip was scum v scum.</div></blockquote><br>\nWhy does this make it a scum v scum fight? why can't it just be matt-town changing his read on chkflip in light of chk's defense, or matt-scum deciding that the chk wagon isn't worth pushing? <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4608983#p4608983\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4608983#p4608983\" data-post-id=\"4608983\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 132</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=12670\">ICEninja</a> wrote:</cite>Well obviously Matt just wants you to have scum reads <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">other</div> than him so that you'll vote someone else.

As I was reading through the game, that was the point at which I thought chk was beginning to towntell, and it was the exact point where projectmatt unvoted, which I thought indicated that the unvote was genuine and not simply because he was scum who didn't think the chkflip wagon was going anywhere.<br>\n<br>\np-edit: what the fuck.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nAlso, defending his ground on his scumread instead of backtracking in the slightest really does feel like the Implosion we know as town. I am fully aware I am somewhat parroting Empire's early read with this line of logic though but it's what I noticed.<br>\n<br>\nThe chain continues through his ISO and I don't feel the need to put the rest of his posts here. It's worth noting that his replacement really has no bearing on his allignment at all considering Implosion, at that time, replaced out of pretty much every single game he was involved in.<br>\n<br>\nAnd, in, of course - comes havingfitz.<br>\n<br>\nI've already outlined to an extent why I feel that having's slot has been generally town -<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4768945#p4768945\" class=\"postlink\">here.</a><br>\n<br>\nThere were a few more reasons that I came to thinking that Having was likely to be town - kind of like an eureka! moment when I let my thoughts wander off, but I can't remember what else I was going to include over here.<br>\n<br>\nSo, what is it about this game that is making me somewhat unsure? <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4631427#p4631427\" class=\"postlink\">Well, I think I've explained just how much I abhor HavingFitz early wall post on me.</a> Being admittedly a bit naturally over-defensive of myself, I still really have trouble letting this one go especially when he stretched or lied about a lot of things, but there are things with his and his replacements play that definitely outweigh the bad here.<br>\n<br>\nOn second thought, I did just remember a strong reason as to why I would lean on Having being town - (sorry if this reads as a bit of a rabbit trail, I'm posting here as I go along)..<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=24645&amp;user_select=19771\" class=\"postlink\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Breakfast starts out his ISO by tunneling on Rob.

His interactions with Implosion are significantly different from Robs.

In this post, he attacks every wagon and almost nothing at all. He gives himself free wiggle room when it comes to me/chkflip being suspected as fake interaction by some players and at the same time, he immediately seems to be setting up by pushing on one town mislynch (Denis) so he could push on some more town lynches later who are -potential partners-. (me/chkflip) Having a bit more experience with Peregine in the past, this really isn't how he plays as town. I mean, he usually at least uses some decent logic but this just feels like lazy pushes + bad setups.<br>\n<br>\nAnd ah, RayFrost, the guy I initially wrote off as town because I thought Junpei (who I considered mafia) was buddying with RayFrost's bad reads and taking advantage of him being a bad town.

But the post before that being an attack on Master Mew (and many posts in his game being towards Rob being town), the switch here almost feels unnatural.

This is shortly after Mew has voted DV.<br>\n<br>\nIn Rob's last post, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4709658#p4709658\">Post 935</a>, he continues his last day's effort to lynch me while saying DV's case on Mew really doesn't exist. Not sure what to make of this quite frankly. Not sure if he's egging DV on perhaps to hammer him (Rob) or just trying to distance himself a bit. At this point in the game I think it was a safe bet that Rob was going to be the lynch. And DV's reluctant hammer just a few posts/hours after this one seemingly came from nowhere.<br>\n<br>\nIn summary...I do think the lack of interest from scum on the DV slot throughout the game...along with some possible prompting from Rob towards DV does shine a bit more suspicion on the slot. I could also see the hammer on Rob as an opportunity to get a little town cred from an outcome that was going to probably happen anyway.<br>\n<br>\nSo I'm talking myself into being more confuesed on the subject that I was. Yesterday I assumed if I made it to today and Matt was still around...that he would be my main suspect. Only thing is...if Matt is not scum...scum would be crazy to not bring me and him to LYLO. grrrrr<br>\n<br>\nI'll take a closer look at Matt asap. I've made my suspicions of him pretty clear throughout the game so I probably don't need to expound on those much. I just have a nagging voice in my head saying he bussed the hell out of both his partners to get sufficient town cred to seal the deal if he made it to LYLO. Like he did in another game he won as scum (which I referenced ealier iirc). So Matt is perfectly capable of taking out both his partners for a win. I'll probably just look over how Breakfast/HD and Rob dealt with him throughout the game and see what that turns up.<br>\n<br>\nI'm definitely more on the fence today than I was going into N6.<br>\n<br>\n@DV...you promised some content <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4798198#p4798198\">over a week ago</a> but the closest thing I see to content is in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4800954#p4800954\">Post 1097</a> from last Wednesday.

It's fair to not townread me for voting some of the mafia - however, what you should realize in attempting to meta me is not who I vote but rather how I play.

I typically stay in 3-4 games at any given time because of what I suspect are ADD-related reasons. One game to focus on that draaaaaaaaaaaags and goes to night where I have to wait for 3 days before I can post again just isn't going to cut it. But more than 4 games and I become more useless than any of my detractors could ever accuse me of being. My point is...I do not have the time or patience to do deep digs into other people's meta so I usually do not. What I will do is go back in people's games to try and find distinct, clear cut examples of things that prove them to be liars or bussers. And I'm not calling you a liar. I'm saying for example someone says they have never done this or that or been in this situation or that...etc....and I look to see if they are telling the truth. So in your case I went looking to see if you were one who was prone to bus. In two of your relatively few games as scum...you bussed. And as I have mentioned...in one you bussed both of your team mates. Very nicely done by the way. And of course it makes me rethink my earlier assumption that because of your role in getting HD lynched...you were most likley scum. Are you potentially scum only for the fact that you have bussed before? Of course not. But because you have....you most certainly aren't a given to be town just becuase you helped vote 1...and then another...scum lynched. I would never look for anything beyond that in terms of playstyle...I just don't have the time or patience to do that sort of comparison. I would also say that you reacted pretty strongly to my suspicions towards you. You didn't OMGUS vote me or anything but you definitely came at (aka attacked) me hard.<br>\n<br>\nNot having a vote actively up is something I look at with a grain of suspicion. Especially when it's for an entire gameday. Does it mean someone's scum? No. But I like commitment.<br>\n<br>\nAgreed with your point on bringing up the NK.<br>\n<br>\nAs for \"paranoia\"....unless there is an Innocent Child or some other somehow confirmed role in a game I look at everyone with a degree of suspicion.
