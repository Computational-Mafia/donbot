Not to say that ICE hasn't - but think about it this way. The fight between matt and chk consists of two sets of interactions - matt's actions towards chk, and chk's towards matt. If matt is town, then his interactions towards chk are going to be the same whether chk is town or scum - thus, it is impossible to distinguish between mattTown-chkTown and mattTown-chkScum <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">based only on their interactions.</span> Likewise, it is impossible to distinguish between mattTown-chkTown and mattScum-chkTown.

Townies do it, which is sad, but it's a stupid argument - it's one of those things which is usually based entirely on gut without anything to back it up logically.

I'm confused as hell by all of this.<br><br>In terms of finding games where people have accused me of setting up lynches, this is MUCH harder to find than I first thought. It has happened in no fewer than 3 of my games (and probably closer to 5, and I'm pretty sure I've been accused of it as scum too) because I like to compartmentalize my scum hunting. I.E. \"this mislynch certainly had scum on it, between these 3 players, I believe X is scum but if he's not then I'm almost certain its Y\" or \"these 3 players can't possibly all be town, so let's lynch X because he's the scummiest but if he's town then Y is almost assuredly scum\", things like that. It just ends up being how I reason through certain things. It doesn't mean I'm going to lynch X today, then Y tomorrow, I'm simply explaining who I feel is scummy, and if X were to happen, this would have Y impact on my future scum reads.<br><br>It seems like every other game there is someone who finds this mentality scummy. I think a failure to think ahead is scummy, because scum have agendas to hide whereas town does not.

I don't see how that's so difficult to understand. Incidentally, sometimes when I look through an ISO to back up a gutread I'll find my read will change - I hadn't ISOed projectmatt until you asked me to back up my read on him. <br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>He isn't lurking or spamming and you're voting him for his posting frequency...</div></blockquote><br>I'm not sure what point you're trying to make here.<br><br>You seemed to be implicitly criticizing me for pushing on a lurker by calling my denis case \"Implosions' case on the lurker\" when half the game is lurking. This is absurd, seeing as firstly I didn't have any scumreads on active players and secondly when half the game is lurking it's distinctly possible (not saying it's likely, but it is <span style=\"font-style: italic\">possible</span>) that all scum are in the lurkers - and since this is possible, it's absurd to criticize someone for pushing on a lurker. <br><br>If you're criticizing me for voting denis for posting frequency while ignoring other lurkers, I felt like denis would be the kind of person who would strategically lurk. So I looked at meta, and found that it was a good place for my vote. I'm not voting him because \"he's a lurker and lurkers must die\" - I'm voting him because of the fact that it was <span style=\"font-style: italic\">him</span> who was lurking. <br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>You don't explain town reads unless they're under significant pressure or asked? Then why did you explain the chkflip read?</div></blockquote><br>Because I was unvoting him, and wanted the reason that I was unvoting to be clear. I also explain townreads occasionally if I'm just in the mood to. I put my vote on denis largely because I couldn't find anywhere better to put it. Incidentally, did you actually <span style=\"font-style: italic\">read</span> my entire post (which contained reasoning for townreading chkflip) before saying that I had not justified my townread on chkflip?

First few pages were pretty underwhelming for him, but his vote on chkflip in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4595975#p4595975\" class=\"postlink\">#69</a> backed up with the points of reasoning regarding his voting patterns and the follow-up pressure in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4600897#p4600897\" class=\"postlink\">#89</a> make a lot of sense and fit very much what I know of his town forum meta - push whatever he can to get the game going, even if it's just something he finds a little bit suspicious. His follow-up on Rob re: him asking ICE for non-RVS meta but not others is a great question, one that I had myself (see below). His switch away from chkflip and onto denis for strategically lurking, complete with the meta links and examination of the frequency of his posting is something that I think is very much unlikely to come from implosion as scum. In both games I specced with scum implosion, he either lurks hardcore (<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?t=22173&amp;f=56&amp;st=0&amp;sk=t&amp;sd=a&amp;user_select=14368&amp;user_select2=0&amp;user_select3=0&amp;user_sort=Go\" class=\"postlink\">Mafia Behind the Maiden</a>) or mainly just uses lazy/bullshit reasoning (<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?t=22453&amp;f=56&amp;st=0&amp;sk=t&amp;sd=a&amp;user_select=14368&amp;user_select2=0&amp;user_select3=0&amp;user_sort=Go\" class=\"postlink\">Otherworld</a>) and I'm not saying either of those flavors of implosion here. I also think implosion comes across as very genuine in the entire back-and-forth with Junpei, especially re: pushing lurkers due to PoE reasons and not out of opportunism.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">projectmatt:</span> Another player I don't really understand people suspecting as I think projectmatt's reactions are very town and I think he is playing massively to his town meta. His entrance into the game pushing a joke wagon on Denis in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4586992#p4586992\" class=\"postlink\">#16</a>-<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4587125#p4587125\" class=\"postlink\">#20</a> hits pretty much what I expected him to come in doing, I think he'd have been a lot more stiff and scripted as scum. The sarcastic reaction to ICEninja's vote, townreading him, and silent vote on Bub in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4590385#p4590385\" class=\"postlink\">#38</a> because he found Bub's entrance to be awkward (<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4595961#p4595961\" class=\"postlink\">#67</a>) and slightly scummy fits how I know he scumhunts to a tee. While I don't exactly agree that Bub is scummy at all (again, see below), there's an identifiable thought process with the vote that very much reads like a legitimate attempt to scumhunt. I also liked the way he held his ground in defending himself against ICEninja, particularly in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4595753#p4595753\" class=\"postlink\">#65</a>, as I think he'd have caved or retreated in some form as scum. I don't find the confidence in his townread on chkflip at all scummy given chkflip's reactions and it makes sense that they remind him of other games together. Also like his reads list in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4615476#p4615476\" class=\"postlink\">#197</a> but that's a pretty minor thing.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">chkflip:</span> The argument with projectmatt about matt's ability to read him as town was literally one of the dumbest fucking things I have ever read in a game of mafia. That being said, I'm 100% with implosion that he comes across like he's genuinely frustrated. The initial accusation that projectmatt couldn't possibly be able to townread him because he's almost always perceived as scummy in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4599396#p4599396\" class=\"postlink\">#83</a> is completely genuine and would be a frankly bizarre angle of attack for him to take as scum. And while his <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4603669#p4603669\" class=\"postlink\">#99</a> is really strained the fact that he goes through the effort of plowing through the games linked comes across like a legitimate attempt to test projectmatt's general ability to read him and I like him asking Bub to chime in on their interaction (<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4603964#p4603964\" class=\"postlink\">#102</a>). Do want to say, though, projectmatt being hypothetically wrong about his ability to read you doesn't necessarily mean he's lying, he could just be mistaken.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Bub Bidderskins:</span> I actually found his vote on Ion in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4586743#p4586743\" class=\"postlink\">#13</a> with the serious reasoning attached to be somewhat of a towntell as it reminds me of his early voting in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?t=23948&amp;f=2&amp;st=0&amp;sk=t&amp;sd=a&amp;user_select=12165&amp;user_select2=0&amp;user_select3=0&amp;user_sort=Go\" class=\"postlink\">Mini 1394</a> as town. Also liked his jump to voting projectmatt in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4592342#p4592342\" class=\"postlink\">#45</a> and his interpretation of matt's chkflip vote in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4603914#p4603914\" class=\"postlink\">#101</a>, while I don't agree with the conclusion there's a thought process going on here that I find natural. His analysis of the projectmatt/chkflip interaction in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4608972#p4608972\" class=\"postlink\">#131</a> and <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4614840#p4614840\" class=\"postlink\">#182</a> makes sense though I think it's a little naive (for example, it's certainly within the realm of possibility that a hypothetical projectmatt/chkflip scum duo would distance in this fashion given the overblown nature of their back and forth but I'm finding it unlikely given that I'm townreading both of them individually).<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Rob13:</span> Wasn't a big fan of his early posting initially regarding meta-checking ICE's RVS meta for a couple of reasons: 1) it felt like a super minor thing to ask about, and 2) he doesn't follow up on it with other players (specifically implosion, who deliberately refused to partake in RVS) and his line of inquiry regarding projectmatt's early joke posting seemed lame. However, I do agree that there seems to be a genuine conviction behind his scumhunting and I particularly liked the way he analyzed the projectmatt/chkflip interaction as scum on scum in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4610182#p4610182\" class=\"postlink\">#144</a> as I think it makes sense that he would find their interaction forced. Aside from that, nothing really caught my eye and I get the impression overall that Rob13's a newbie playing very rigidly not really scummy.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Lincolm:</span> Weakest townread here mostly due to the effort and level of depth he put into his reads list in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4615385#p4615385\" class=\"postlink\">#196</a>, which seems impressive to me with a player of his experience. However, I do want to ask one thing because it's really bugging me about him and I'm bolding it because it really needs answering: <span class=\"noboldsig\">What made you change your mind on Denis from saying you were sure he was pro-town (<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4613896#p4613896\" class=\"postlink\">#178</a>) to having him as a scumread (<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4615385#p4615385\" class=\"postlink\">#196</a>)?</span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">NULL:</span><br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">denisatp:</span> I don't find his early trolling, abrasive attitude, and early tracker claim to be particularly scummy and knowing him I think that's something that would come from Denis as either alignment really. I do want to see more of him and what he actually thinks, though.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">wam:</span> Nothing much here. I guess his voting chkflip for being a late bandwagon voter in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4589315#p4589315\" class=\"postlink\">#32</a> and <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4589621#p4589621\" class=\"postlink\">#34</a> makes sense but I don't think it's alignment indicative even for someone with his experience level.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Junpei:</span> Given my own assumption about his skill and his experience level, I think his entire back and forth with implosion and his scumreads on Denis/projectmatt is something he could plausibly do as both alignments. The points projectmatt brings up in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4615476#p4615476\" class=\"postlink\">#197</a> make sense, but I need to see some more from him to be able to actually gauge his alignment here.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">PeregrineV:</span> Having played with him once in the past (albeit in a hydra) and having followed some of his games, Pere can be tough to read since he tends to be pretty lurky/low content as both alignments. That being said, I don't like how he interprets the projectmatt/chkflip interaction in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4609581#p4609581\" class=\"postlink\">#139</a> by implying they could both be town (\"the exchange could be legit\") and then suggests that they could both be scum (\"if you step back and look at the topics of each post and paraphrase each one, sounds kind of fake\"). It feels like he's trying to assert a stance without actually doing so. Aside from that, I find that Pere gets easier to read as the game goes on since he tends to play a stronger town game than scum game (he struggles on what to say as scum).<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #FF0000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">SCUM (Strongest to Weakest):</span></span></span><br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Breakfast:</span> Hard to put a finger on what rubs me the wrong way about his ISO but if I had to articulate it, I'd say that a lot of his posting seems more intended to cast suspicions on people rather than an attempt to analyze their motivations. For example: the accusation that Rob's \"putting words in [projectmatt's] mouth\" (<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4597800#p4597800\" class=\"postlink\">#78</a>), the accusation that Bub is \"contradicting himself\" and the idea that chkflip comes off as scummier in the exchange between himself and projectmatt (<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4613069#p4613069\" class=\"postlink\">#175</a>) - the way the latter opinion is phrased comes across like he's opportunistically scumreading chkflip while also opening himself up to a possible projectmatt wagon if it arises. The vote on implosion in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4615348#p4615348\" class=\"postlink\">#195</a> feels like he's stretching for reasons for the vote. Also, his notion of leaving a \"coinflip lynch\" like Denis until lylo (<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4612953#p4612953\" class=\"postlink\">#172</a>) makes zero sense.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Ion67:</span> Weak read here, but I really didn't like <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4612802#p4612802\" class=\"postlink\">#171</a> at all - I think the way he tries to cast suspicion on Denis comes off as forced and his interpretation of the projectmatt/chflip interaction feels lazy and strained.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Unvote, vote: Breakfast</span>"}

Actually even I have townread on someone, I keep them as my suspects (meaning I'm very hard to have solid read). I think \"suspects\" in there actually who I watch more? OK for that.<br><br>First is Denis. His role claim is a troll for everyone (town and mafia). Dunno why he troll us. I think he want to get reaction if he is town. But all of his post really, it is horrible, might be because he is PR, he is too lazy to argued. He did know what he do is scummy, but he still did it, which made several WIFOMing for everyone, I quiet sure he is trolling mafia, but also maybe VI. Dunno which one...<br><br>Second is Breakfast.

If he's town and seriously claiming town PR with no pressure on him just because he's a \"shit-poster\", which basically means he's a troll, then he's deliberately playing against his wincon with that claim. I'm not going to assume that because that would assume that denis is breaking site rules, which is not an assumption I'm willing to make about any player. Call me optimistic, but I'd like to assume that everyone's playing towards their wincon. The site rules are supposed to allow that assumption.<br><br>The reason why I feel I need to make this assumption is because if I do not, then I can't read anyone. If people aren't playing to their wincon, then they can't be read because their motivations will never line up with their alignment.

First, chkflip stated that your meta is garbage posting, which i had to address (see post #231) and then you misrep'd me and said that I stated any claiming is against site rules, which forced me to address how it would be and what I meant by that. Those two posts are why I started talking about why I'm not going to consider the possibility of you playing against your wincon (and then clarifying that further in future posts).

It's all very lol.<br><br>@Junpei - It's not me stating that not playing the way I play is playing against wincon. It's saying that claiming as a town PR for no reason is against wincon. Maybe a newbie would see it another way, but denis isn't a newbie. He's been on-site for a year and a half.

I think you're performing a gambit in which you're attempting to play so horribly anti-town on purpose so that people start dismissing every scummy thing that you do and chalk you up as noob-town or idiot-town.

The fact that you've admitted to an outright lie makes it much more likely that you're lying all over the place as part of your gambit.<br><br>Why would you lie about your motivations for claiming as town?

I tend to rely more heavily on meta early when there's very little to go on and then transition into more of a looking for town vs. scum motivation later in the game as it becomes easier to see.

I think you're performing a gambit in which you're attempting to play so horribly anti-town on purpose so that people start dismissing every scummy thing that you do and chalk you up as noob-town or idiot-town.

That actually doesn't matter since my first reason which was more of a theoretical reason still applies. \"if you were town, your actual motivations would speak for themselves as town-like?\" if town's motivations automatically spoke as town-like then there would be no such thing as the game of mafia. The first thing that comes to the mind of town who see's somebody who he thinks is trolling is \"trolling/not caring town\" or \"trolling/trying to appear town by playing without care mafia\" not fucking \"I already explained what I think you are trying to do with your play.

If there is a good case on Rob I do not recall it.  chkflp was making my radar ping a bit earlier in the game but for the most part (aside from my observation above) I'm leaning town on him (I think mostly due to his outburst).  I think Empire is probably town.  I'm most interested in a Matt lynch.  I do not care for denis's play but I think the claim deserves a night to play out (plus as I said earlier...I think the unnecessary claim is more likely from bad town than scum).  There are really a lot of slots that are lacking material so I'm pretty confident there's scum among them (wam, HD, Ion, lincolm, Ray and to a somewhat lesser degree Junpei and Bub).<br><br>Caught up.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: projectmatt</span>"}

This despite the fact you yourself have spent a good portion of today with denis as a scum read.  Could you please explain?  Link to the post where you changed you mind on denis perhaps?<br> <br>I hate self-votes.  Hate \u2018em. <br><br>And I see RayFrost uses the same stream of consciousness catch up that people despise when I give.  Bravo.  <br><br>What Imp/matt connections are people referring to?<br> <br>The content from wam and Breakfast is pathetic\u2026though wam at least has the unfortunate excuse of a ridiculously long replace-out worthy v/LA.  Ion and Bub also underposting I see.  Of these underposters I\u2019m probably the most suspicious of Breakfast but with all the other content in the game\u2026I hate to vote someone who is probably headed for replacement soon.   (Edit...I see Breakfast has been replaced so I'd like to see what HD can contribute).<br> <br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Summary</span>\u2026I don't like any of the wagons now that Breakfast is gone.  If there is a good case on Rob I do not recall it.  chkflp was making my radar ping a bit earlier in the game but for the most part (aside from my observation above) I'm leaning town on him (I think mostly due to his outburst).  I think Empire is probably town.  I'm most interested in a Matt lynch.  I do not care for denis's play but I think the claim deserves a night to play out (plus as I said earlier...I think the unnecessary claim is more likely from bad town than scum).  There are really a lot of slots that are lacking material so I'm pretty confident there's scum among them (wam, HD, Ion, lincolm, Ray and to a somewhat lesser degree Junpei and Bub).<br><br>Caught up.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: projectmatt</span></div></blockquote><br>okay thanks for telling me something that we already established."}

Fitz's line of inquiry regarding projectmatt's vote <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4628500#p4628500\" class=\"postlink\">#375</a> makes some sense and comes across like he's legitimately trying to get a read on him. Ray's comments on Rob make a lot of sense to me as I'm also getting the same impression from Rob13 too - I think Rob's attack on Denis is just him having really rigid conceptions of town behavior and trying to apply them here, something that checks out given his inexperience.<br><br>You guys really need to vote Breakfast's slot (the lurking in this context makes him <span style=\"font-style: italic\">more</span> worthy of a vote, not less), especially considering that the other major wagons are likely on town, thanks in advance."}

The \"we, as town\" bit.</div></blockquote><br> <br>You don't like it but you don't explain why.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Why did you think denis was <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4590385#p4590385\">\"probably town\"</a> despite his horrendous read?</div></blockquote><br><br>Let me explain something, loud and clear, because it appears that the neuron count in your brain is far too low to grasp it - having a bad read does not make you mafia. Having a scumread on a player who is town is NOT something that is a scumtell. It can be, under certain circumstances, but in general if a town votes another town, it doesn ot mean everyone on my wagon is mafia. that \"you are probably town\" comment was at ICEninja, BTW, not Denis, which kind of proves you literally just skimmed through my ISO to incriminate me for anything.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>In Post 46 you tell Rob you won't attack a town read (is Rob a town read for you?) but you will \"explain why their logic is bad,\"...however; you aren't explaining why his logic is bad. You're just asking a question already asked by Ice. Comes across as trying to look like you are scumhunting. And you excuse it by saying to forgot Ice had asked Rob about meta'ing him [Ice]. This despite the fact Ice had asked Rob only two posts early...so you forgot in the span of two posts which I would assume you have read prior to your Post 46 as it was so recent.<br></div></blockquote><br><br>I <span class=\"noboldsig\">did</span> explain why the logic was bad. In THAT post. Anything more than a quick skim would reveal this.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>In Post 47 he declares he does not need to provide any reason for voting Bub. So I would assume he was doing it for some sort of reaction.</div></blockquote><br><br>You didn't read a damn thing I said, considering I explained why I voted Bub in my list of reads, over <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4615476#p4615476\" class=\"postlink\">here:</a><br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>So Post 20 was in fact a joke AND a test according to Post 57. Masterfully worded awkwardly to elicit the optimal information I'm assuming. @Matt...what was the outcome of your joke test? Did you ever un-\"conceal\" your findings?</div></blockquote><br><br>It was a joke, and a test. A test in the sense that while I was mainly messing around with Denis, I wanted to see both his and other's reactions. It's pathetic that people are contemplating pushing on me due to a joke on the first page of the entire game. The results? I did out my \"results\" in the sense that Ice and Rob's reactions gave me quite a lot to read into. I don't say that it's something that's magical but on page 1 it's perfectly fine.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>In Post 65 Matt asks chkflp for his reason in voting him [Matt] despite the fact he [Matt] just got done telling Bub a page earlier that he [Matt] didn't need to give him [Bub] a reason for voting him [Bub]. So he doesn't want to give others reasons they can defend themselves against but at the same time he wants to know the reasons being used against him for what I can only assume is to defend himself against. So vague and defensive at the same time. He then of course gives his (weak) vote rational on Bub in his own defense of suspicions raised by Ice.</div></blockquote><br><br>Tell me how my rational was weak. Do it. Of course I want to know other's logic but if I want to conceal a reasoning for a read so I can see, once again, how Bub would respond to it that's perfectly fine. <br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>More joking with denis. What a special relationship. Why do you keep joking and then using it as a negative when people take you seriously? Was Post 70 for a reaction as well? Maybe you should end posts that are jokes with a j/k or /joke.</div></blockquote><br><br>..What the hell is wrong with you?<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>A bit of an ad-hom IMO towards chkflp. Ah! Followed by a vote (with no rationale of course) on chkflp...who incidentally was the last person to vote Matt. It's not OMGUS thought because you do not think it is \"his town play.\" Ok...got it.</div></blockquote><br><br><span style=\"font-size: 200%; line-height: 116%;\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">I made a wall of text explaining why I fos'd Chkflip 2 posts later.</span></span><br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>In Post 105 Matt explains to Bub how he [Matt] put the 3rd vote on Chkflp by leaving Bub's wagon which also had 3 votes (ie there was no difference in momentum). However this is not true. Bub only had 2 votes when matt got off it... (Matt and PerV) and in fact...PerV had only placed the 2nd vote on Bub 5 posts prior to Matt switching to chkflp. So not a factual description by Matt of his actions IMO.<br></div></blockquote><br><br>Fair enough that I did misread the vote count by the moderator.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>In Post 116 Matt follows up several posts between he and chkflp with an unvote of chkflp. No reason given. I thought he really suspected chkflp but apparently not. No immediate follow on vote. And In ten posts later Matt is ecstatic to announce that chkflp is a town read for him.  Oh...and we should lynch Bub or denis...neither of whom he lays a vote down on.<br></div></blockquote><br><br>I don't even think Denis is mafia nor did I ever suggest lynching him. I explained, once again, several posts later that I wanted to see WHAT PEOPLE WOULD SAY to my wall of reads before I placed a vote on my wall. When the deadline still has quite a way to go, what the hell is wrong with waiting a few hours to put up a real vote?<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>In Posts 134 and 138 Matt lays the ad homs down on Ice who is \"moronically confident in his inconceivably stupid logic. <br></div></blockquote><br><br>How is this ad home?<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>In Post 170 Matt requests no one quickhammer denis. How very townie to not want a quickhammer.<br></div></blockquote><br><br>Go screw yourself.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>In Post 197 Matt gives his reads: Scummish (Junpei and Bub); townish (Rob, denis (wtf??), chkflp (??), and the formerly inconceivably stupid Ice (Empire)0. Perv (RayFrost) is a null and everyone else is forgotten or TBD. Still no vote layed bown by Matt btw.<br></div></blockquote><br><br>Why are you surprised that I townread Denis/Chk? Also, why do you think that me thinking a player is stupid translates into me thinking they are mafia? For instance, you are stupid but there is a minuscule chance you could be town.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Annnnnnnnnnnnnnnd in 5 posts later Matt votes Breakfast (of the forgotten/TBD group) for no reason (later established to be based on the wisdom of Empire's reads.</div></blockquote><br><br><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4628500#p4628500\" class=\"postlink\">You admitted yourself that Empire made some great points.</a><br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>RayFrost is now town despite his poor reads.</div></blockquote><br><br>Poor. Reads. Are. Not. Mafia.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>In Post 364 Matt pleads with me to vote for one of our underposters. Not any specifically (ex. Breakfast/HD) but rather any of them. Self preservation mode in place. He doesn't care who I've voting for as long as it's not him.</div></blockquote><br><br>I wasn't PLEADING with you to vote any of them, I wanted to know why you said you had a confident scumread and you were choosing another target.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>In Post 365 Matt lays a little ad hom down on one of his townreads (Rob).</div></blockquote><br><br>It's not ad hom if i've explained why the logic is awful and are still angry with the player for sticking to it, idiot.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>In Post 376 Matt shows he isn't paying the closest attention to things.<br></div></blockquote><br><br>You're pathetic. Confusing who replaced into who during the game is not the same as \"not paying attention to the closest things\". <br><br>I've got to hand it to you, havingfitz - you make a compelling case. With your misuses of the term \"ad hominem\" to make it sound like you know what you're talking about, paired with a large amount of condescension, exaggeration, pretending not to see explanations and stretching, it's hard not to believe you."}

Since I have somewhat of a history with CD, however short that may be, I decided to check it out.  That said, I shot him a PM and told him that I'd take the spot.<br><br>I read up until about Page 8, then realized that I still had 9 pages to go and frankly just didn't feel like reading them.  So, instead of reading, I decided to skip to the end to see who was lynched.  Turns out it was HD (who replaced Breakfast) who was lynched and flipped scum.  Deciding it would give me much more insight into Mafia if I just ISO'd both Breakfast and HD - I decided to do just that.  Here's what I found:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4587182#p4587182\" class=\"postlink\">post 22</a>, denisatp wrote:</cite>matt, now let me tell you something, im only telling you this once, my role may help the town VERY much.<br>implosion, shut the fuck up nobody cares about your opinion.</div></blockquote><br>This is literally post #22.  There is absolutely no reason to make a soft-claim like this at this stage of the game.  My opinion: He's testing the waters to see how everyone would react to a post like this.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4610187#p4610187\" class=\"postlink\">post 145</a>, denisatp wrote:</cite>Okay I'm tracker. Not making wall posts arguing srry not srry</div></blockquote><br>Again, absolutely no reason to make a claim like this.  My opinion: He doesn't want to play this game.  He wants to be an asshole for as long as possible, and making a random claim like this on Day 1 will allow him to do that for as long as possible.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4610236#p4610236\" class=\"postlink\">post 152</a>, denisatp wrote:</cite>Mafia would make sure to claim asap b/c they love attention</div></blockquote><br>Hmm... I read this as nothing more than: \"I'm going to see if I can blatantly state exactly how I'm playing - so that the longer I stay alive in this game, the move I can rub it in their faces later.\"<br><br>As for Denis, that's all I really care to read from him at the moment.  However, let's switch over to the confirmed scum now.  I scanned Breakfast's posts - there is only 5.  However, even in only 5 posts - I've found one that is useful.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4612953#p4612953\" class=\"postlink\">post 172</a>, Breakfast wrote:</cite>Sorry for absence, been busy and can't quote posts right now.<br><br>I don't read Denis either way, and it doesn't seem like he will post anything of interest at the moment, but I think it would be better to ignore him for now and look at people who seem more scummy than just anti-town. I don't think the way he's posting is readable for alignment, and if it's going to be a coinflip lynch I'd rather it be in LYLO.</div></blockquote><br>Pushing like this is common for a Newbscum.  While he didn't blatantly say, \"We should believe Denis!\"  He did state that he would like to wait to lynch him until LYLO.  This leads me to believe that they're partners.<br><br>I also ISO'd HumanDestroyer.  HD was very different from Breakfast in that he almost entirely avoided mentioning Denis altogether.  The ONLY time he mentioned his name, outside of his vote-counting post that he threw up just to make it look like he was actually doing something, was this post right here.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4632047#p4632047\" class=\"postlink\">post 433</a>, Human Destroyer wrote:</cite>Does anyone actually believe denis's tracker claim?</div></blockquote><br>This is nothing more than fishing for reactions. No one, at least I think, at this point openly stated that they believed Denis' claim.  I'm not sure exactly why, but he seemed to have wanted to know.  Probably wanted to know so that Denis would feel safe making a claim such as his very first post during Day 2.<br><br>He figured that if people believed him, he would feel much safer making a claim such as that he just so happened to choose the EXACT target that made the NK last night."}

I started reading during the night phase.  I read until about page 8 or 9.  However, when I read Denis' tracker claim - I double took.  It was right there I decided that he was my JK target and I immediately send CD my choice of action.<br><br>The way I saw it, I was confirming his claim.  He was the only townie to make even make as much as a soft-claim to a PR - therefore, I found him the most likely target of a Mafia Nightkill.  If the day would have started and no kill was made <span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"font-style: italic\">OR</span></span> Denis had started the day by claiming that he had no result, I would have believed his tracker claim.

At the same time, it is not unfeasible that mafia would not target the outed tracker. They definitely wouldn't target the tracker with a kill because you were an obvious protection target based on your claim. The only way I could see mafia targeting you is if they had a strongman (in which case you would be dead, so this is no longer possible) or if they had a role-blocker.

I only placed it because I saw growing scum-motivation behind your actions.</div></blockquote><br><br>This is the scummiest post in this game right now, hands down. Several reasons:<br><br>First of all, you assume that scum has no motivation to stop the wagon of a townie. Not true. If you do it right, it could lead everyone to believe you're town. Sacrificing one easy mislynch to move up to near the top of everyone's \"town\" list? Scum would do that in a heartbeat if they thought it would work. You could also perform these actions in an attempt to get denis lynched (a better lynchee in the scum's eyes by virtue of his PR), attempt to out additional PRs (guess what happened!), OR defend your scum partner (Fitz). All of these are possible motivations for your actions by scum. Suggesting that you would only ever commit the actions you did if Fitz was your partner is facetious.<br><br>Next, you're trying to say that Fitz can in no way be your scum partner because it's improbable that Denis hit the remaining mafia goon with a randomly targeted PR action. First, his action wasn't random, so that's untrue. Denis targeted the person he thought was the most scummy. Second, just because it's improbable doesn't make it impossible.<br><br>You go on to try to put yourself and Fitz as a package deal. This bothers me significantly. One of you flipping one alignment doesn't confirm the other either way, especially you flipping town. How does you flipping town confirm Fitz as town? Please explain that to me, because I think that's rather blatantly untrue. If you see some logic in that, then I certainly don't. I don't think there's any there.<br><br>And to top off everything, the conclusion of your post is an attempt to bargain with me to stop looking your way. You try to convince me to stop engaging you and look elsewhere in exchange for getting a vote off of me. So, so scummy. Town doesn't use their vote as a bargaining chip to remove pressure from themselves. There is no town motivation for what you're trying to do here."}

IMO, town-Junpei, but he would try to turn against both Matt and myself AND include the possibility that I'm scum and simply buddying, which he did.  Scum-Junpei probably would have just tried to implicate me only because attempting to implicate both of us might put some of the attention towards Matt too.  Why try to drag another townie into the argument when all you really need is his vote?  Result: Null-Town.<br><br>The third person in this scenario was Matt, but he hasn't responded yet - but since you called me out on it before he had a chance to post he'll be exempt from this test.

However, it was also AFTER I had just presented a case against Junpei and how I think he's scum.  Up to that point, both you and Junpei had many posts regarding me as scum, therefore...<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Rob</span>, if you were town and you were scum-hunting, you should feel as though you have already made quite a large case against me and should feel very comfortable in what you've stated so far.  IMO, town-Rob - since the post itself doesn't concern him at all, would have ignored it whereas scum-Rob simply sees it as more ammo for his cannon, so why not try to dump that on me too?  Take note that Rob hasn't tried to implicate Matt in anyway as a result of that post - only me.  It's important.  Result: Scum-Rob wins hands down.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Junpei</span>, considering the post directly involves him it makes it a little harder to analyze.  IMO, town-Junpei, but he would try to turn against both Matt and myself AND include the possibility that I'm scum and simply buddying, which he did.  Scum-Junpei probably would have just tried to implicate me only because attempting to implicate both of us might put some of the attention towards Matt too.  Why try to drag another townie into the argument when all you really need is his vote?  Result: Null-Town.<br><br>The third person in this scenario was Matt, but he hasn't responded yet - but since you called me out on it before he had a chance to post he'll be exempt from this test.  Both versions of Matt probably would have tried to distance in at least someway.  The harder the attempt at distancing, the more scummy IMO.<br><br>The question about not voting him still stands though.

Only have time for a quick post right now since I have to leave for class in about an hour. Apologize in advance if it's kind of rambly, it's early and I haven't slept much.<br><br>Right so I'm still not entirely sure what's going on with the PR claims, only thing I'm able to parse out at the moment is that if Rob is real I think a Godfather being in this setup is very unlikely - having a role that's completely immune to cop investigations exist to balance against a 1-Shot Cop seems like overkill to me. This means, therefore, that Denis is more likely to be town I think - the only way he's scum is if he's partnered up with Rob since Rob being real necessarily means that Denis is town if my assumption about the setup is correct. I'm also reading Rob as town too so I'm willing to write both of them as town right now. I also have a strong townread on Lincolm, especially after his claim which I felt was super genuine (e.g., the hesitation in outing Rob, an unclaimed PR at the time + Rob confirming his visit which would mean Lincolm would have to be extremely lucky to guess that as scum and that's a gambit I don't think he's likely to pull).<br><br>This leaves ThunderHog. Though I think it's possible all 4 PRs are real, I've found TH's posts to be pretty scummy and I think both Junpei/Rob come off better in their back-and-forth. I found myself agreeing with Rob in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4650409#p4650409\" class=\"postlink\">#585</a> that TH bargaining with his vote in that fashion was really terrible and it just reads like he's trying to intimidate someone off the wagon or try and deflect suspicion away from himself. I also found his claim to be \"reaction testing\" Junpei/Rob in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4655651#p4655651\" class=\"postlink\">#609</a> to be pretty BS and it just feels like a backpedal response more than anything once Junpei called him out on it. I also find the way he's shifted his read on Junpei from finding him scum to finding him somewhat townish to be pretty shitty too, reads like he's just trying to appease Junpei rather than from a natural progression.<br><br>I'm fine with hammering him once everyone's fully caught up. I specifically want to hear DV's and Master Mew's thoughts once they finish reading the whole thread.<br><br>---<br><br>One thing that I think also needs to be considered is the chkflip kill.

And I didn't include the timeline stuff because I didn't really see that line of attack as all that compelling while I was reading and the other stuff stuck out more.

A normal townie would keep reading to make sure that the claim was legitimate and that there weren't any other claims or anything else he had to be aware of. All you did was ISO the dead and post. In fact at the time of your claim you still show nothing that says you're caught up.</div></blockquote><br>It doesn't really make much sense that he'd target a claimed PR without reading the entire thread. I mean, targeting a claimed PR as a Jailkeeper is silly on its own but doing so without really seeing if there are any other potential suspects worth acting on is pretty ludicrous. I also really don't like that his play's generally been reactive and, as far as I'm aware, he hasn't really given any reads on anyone other than the people who have been voting/attacking him."}

WTF?<br><br>OK...done.<br><br>Where does that leave me?  I still have suspicions towards Junpei.  They seemed to grow as the game progressed but then some of his points towards Thunder make sense and Thunder's play has seemed a bit flailing lately.  Probably the main reason I maintain suspicion towards Junpei is how quick he was to join my wagon after denis' lying claim result.  I got to L-1 quickly (understandly based on denis' lie....but scum would have known a) denis was lying and b) that he had been blocked.  So one of two things (or both) could have happened.  Scum could have hopped onto my wagon knowing it was going to be an easy mislynch that would lead most likely to denis' demise the following day AND/OR...scum could go for tons of town cred and just claim to have \"jailkept\" denis (essentially the same as roleblocking) and coasted to the end. <br><br>Of the first circumstance...if there is going to be scum on my wagon I think it is most likely to be Junpei because, correct me if I am wrong, but denis is confirmed town given all the claim results; Lincolm is close to confirmed town (unless he and Rob are scum gambitting out their arses, which I do not see happening); Rob's claim seems legit and Empire has just been a stronger town read most of the game.  So PoE points to Junpei.  Though...all of them (except for denis) voted HD too so for someone on my L-1 wagon to be scum...they'd have had to of bussed HD...which is perfectly reasonable given his play.<br>I don't see my Junpei wagon getting anywhere so I'm cool with a Thunder lynch. <br> <br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: </span><br> <br>It looks like several people are willing to hammer but it would still be good to hear Deasvail and Lincolm's thoughts first.  Is Lincolm even still in the game?  He hasn't had a vote out since he claimed watcher?"}

The result is looking very scummy. The only reason I didn't vote you earlier is because I think a Mafia 1-Shot Watcher is kind of an odd role, but I have to rethink that now.<br><br>Second, you just literally recapped your case from like two to three posts ago that I already responded to and refuted like it was new shit that hasn't been already torn apart as ludicrous. You didn't bother to address any of my responses in this simplified version of your incredibly flawed argument, nor did you complicate the argument based on my responses. You'd rather just ignore everything I'm saying because if you can convince everyone to shove their hands over their ears and scream \"lalalalalalala,\" then you can get an easy mislynch off of me. I'm not going down without pointing out how you're scum first.<br><br>Here's my thoughts. I gave way too much credibility to Lincolm's claim. I assumed that the fact that he is a confirmed Watcher based on his results also makes him a confirmed town member. That's not necessarily true, and indeed it is unlikely the more I think about it. Putting a cop, a watcher, and a tracker all in the same setup is kind of overkill. They're all investigative roles and even with X-shot modifications, it seems like it gives too high of a probability that scum (possibly multiple scum, if there is a scum PR - which is extremely likely) would be caught Day 1. On the other hand, a scum watcher would be a pretty good thing to balance out the investigative roles of cop and tracker (as well as other town PRs). It could help find and neutralize town PRs faster.<br><br>Based on his recent play and the anti-town manner in which he is composing his case on me:<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Unvote<br>Vote Lincolm</span>"}

Junpei said this : <br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4642120#p4642120\" class=\"postlink\">post 534</a>, Junpei wrote:</cite>You assume that you wouldn't be scum with fitz; <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">you assume that he is town.</span> If you are town then I think that it'd be natural to include that.

He said that Rob was fake claiming and plausible and TH was fake claiming and not plausible. (and I can't ask this also) And you, Rob, ignored it that Junpei said you were fake claiming. Why?<br>To clear the question, see below :<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4646072#p4646072\" class=\"postlink\">post 566</a>, Junpei wrote:</cite>His fakeclaim is plausible, yours is not.</div></blockquote><br><br>Junpei post in #573 is horrible also. If he really assumed TH as mafia, then he must assumed Fitz as mafia also, but he didn't assume it (Note : He said this to Bub). Also, why he assumed in TH's partner is roleblocker who not roleblock Denis? (And I can't ask this also)<br><br>Rob, you said in #585 that you think mafia wanted to get town creed. Please, if mafia in beginning (normally) 3 persons, and lynched 1 in day 1, do you really think that mafias try to get town creed? Short of , it is almost likely not happen. With 2 mafias, and 9 townies, they must mislynch three times and kill all PRs and strong townie at night (which they don't know how many PRs in town) to gain save condition. To get Denis lynched, he can hammer and said \"Denis said it, why accuse me?\", not fake claiming, except Fitz was his partner. To out the additional PRs, it is because of me, and you blame TH? This is impossible case.<br><br>Rob, for your post #609, the fact is TH is honest, and what do you think about that reaction test that you just wiggled in day 2? His case in Junpei, I think it is acceptable and reasonable. Tell me why it is laughable. <br><br>That's all. You need to answer all of this, except my question to Junpei."}

If there's only a single scum-faction (which the scum would more-or-less know after only one NK the night before), then they can safely claim Town Jailkeeper with literally no way for the town to verify that they're fake-claiming provided they never target the same person that their own scum-team targets (which they could, of course, ensure never happened). For these reasons, I thought the following:<br><br>1. TH's claim did NOT clear him in any way because it was a good scum-claim for a Mafia Roleblocker given the situation. My reasoning for this was very similar to Bub's re:me about the 1-shot cop claim. An important difference between my and Bub's thinking is that while I only concluded that TH's claim did not confirm him, Bub concluded that my claim actually made me scummy, which I still don't see the sense in.<br><br>2. While TH's claim did NOT confirm alignment, it DID confirm role (either JK or Roleblocker).<br><br>3. I should evaluate TH based on his play and more-or-less not factor in the claim because it didn't clear him.<br><br>TH's play was scummy, as I highlighted throughout Day 2, so I concluded that he was scum.

In other posts he said that if TH is scum, Fitz is likely scum due to the way in which the TH's claim occurred. I don't even... Where do you come up with this stuff? You're pulling it out of your ass.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4696881#p4696881\" class=\"postlink\">post 852</a>, Lincolm wrote:</cite>Rob, you said in #585 that you think mafia wanted to get town creed. Please, if mafia in beginning (normally) 3 persons, and lynched 1 in day 1, do you really think that mafias try to get town creed? Short of , it is almost likely not happen. With 2 mafias, and 9 townies, they must mislynch three times and kill all PRs and strong townie at night (which they don't know how many PRs in town) to gain save condition. To get Denis lynched, he can hammer and said \"Denis said it, why accuse me?\", not fake claiming, except Fitz was his partner. To out the additional PRs, it is because of me, and you blame TH? This is impossible case.</div></blockquote><br><br>First, you either don't understand or are ignoring the motivations behind scum. The number one thing that scum are trying to do is look like town. If they convince everyone in the game that they're town, then they've won because they'll never be lynched. Think of it this way. Would scum rather have ONE mislynch or a greatly decreased likelihood of being lynched themselves in all future days AND a possibility of still mislynching today? As scum, I'd take the second option hands down. No contest.<br><br>Also, I specifically stated that TH could be trying to get denis mislynched when I was talking about PRs in that post. That was a PR that was already claimed and known by Day 2. This is another reason, by the way, that TH could have had motivation to stop the wagon. He could have been trying to go for the PR mislynch over the easier unknown mislynch because removing a PR increases his chances of winning. Obviously I know this now to be untrue, but I believed it not only possible but probable in Day 2. I stand by my thought process. TH was playing like scum.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4696881#p4696881\" class=\"postlink\">post 852</a>, Lincolm wrote:</cite>Rob, for your post #609, the fact is TH is honest, and what do you think about that reaction test that you just wiggled in day 2? His case in Junpei, I think it is acceptable and reasonable. Tell me why it is laughable.</div></blockquote><br><br>I don't know what you meant in the first bit of your sentence about the reaction test. Please clarify.<br><br>His case on Junpei was downright pathetic. Here's some of the many issues with it.<br><br>1. He criticizes Junpei for not sticking with a vote on Denis for the gambit DESPITE the fact that I announced an innocent on denis, which would clearly make any sensible person take their vote off denis.<br><br>2. Criticizes Junpei for earlier in the day calling him \"least likely to be mafia\" out of the role claims. Ignores the fact that shit happens and reads change to respond to it. Welcome to the game of Mafia, TH!<br><br>3. Continuously complains about Junpei \"discrediting\" him when in fact Junpei was just disagreeing with him or arguing that he was scummy. Is that a form of discrediting? Maybe. Is it scummy? No - it's normal in Mafia. Does it belong in a case on why Junpei is scum? lolno.<br><br>4. Almost all points used as evidence of Junpei being scum are points in which Junpei was arguing that TH was possibly (and later probably) scum. Gave the whole case an OMGUS taste to it.<br><br>P-edit:<br><br>That was a bad post. Scum that are down to two people on Day 2 are not likely to be super active and aggressive in my opinion, especially when they know that the lynch they're pushing is (necessarily) going to be a mislynch. Why would they want to be the poster-boy to the mislynch of a town PR? That makes very little (no?) sense. Also, I do not understand how you think that confusion = town with regards to PR stuff. I similarly do not understand how you think Mew or DV were confused about the town PR stuff. I saw no evidence of that. Please give an example. Lastly, if you think that there is a scum amongst the claimed PRs, which you do at the moment, then why do you think the people ignoring the claimed PRs are town? Isn't that counter-intuitive? If someone's scum-partner fake-claimed, wouldn't they want to draw as little attention towards the claim as possible? Your thought process on this doesn't make much sense."}

The longer it remains stagnant the more likely we are to get a rushed lynch at deadline (and it would probably be a mislynch).<br><br>Here are my thoughts on the game....<br><br>Rob is the days frontrunner due to a strong push by Bub and a somewhat strong push by Lincolm. The longer the day goes on the more the case on Rob seems to come apart, be shown to not exist, or be based on WIFOM. Assessment - Rob could be scum but is by no means a slam dunk.<br><br>We could get into set up speculation but that IMO seems to usually favor scum. Giving personal experience with certain set ups is ok I guess (especially considering I did some earlier with my views towards having a watcher and tracker in the same game) but otherwise I don't put a lot of weight into it.<br><br>Lincolm is confirmed town unless people want to consider the possibility of him being a Mafia watcher. I doubt this is the case if he was a Mafia watcher there would have been no need to provide his results on Thunder and Rob. He would know what their alignments were and scum could have just saved them for NKs. So IMO Lincolm is town.<br><br>Now that we know Thunder was a mislynch I think it is reasonable to expect there to be at least one scum on his wagon. However...if there was a case for a wagon that had NO scum on it...Thunder's would qualify. Aside from the brief amount of time I had a wagon (because of denis's lying claim on me) there was really no one else really generating a counter wagon to Thunder. So I think VCA holds little weight up to this point.<br><br>Everyone probably warrants a certain amount of suspicions towards them. Several lurky types (especially today) and some new players who's predecessors gained some suspicion.<br><br>If I wasn't going to vote Rob today I think my three frontrunners for a vote would be Matt, N, Bub or Mew. N and Mew moreso based on their predecessors; Bub based on his speculative push towards Rob (so Rob's flip <span class=\"noboldsig\">could</span> clear Bub &amp; vice-versa); and Matt.<br><br>Regarding Matt. I had a good deal of <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4627236#p4627236\">suspicions towards him on D1</a> that I let slide on D2 and beyond due to his push on scum (HD) D1. The denis fakeclaim + Rob:Thunder debates put Matt out of mind for me on D2, along with the early buzz today around Rob. However...as the Rob wagon starts to wane a bit a closer look at Matt makes me question my earlier pardon of him. I asked Matt if he had any previous scum games earlier today and rather than have him feed them to me...once he said there were some I went looking. And in the two most significant (IMO) scum games he had (Open 391 and Open 322) he bussed heavily. In 391 he bussed both his partners (to no avail) and in 322 he bussed his way to victory. He even apologized to his partner later for bussing him so hard on D1. So in this game...Matt's actions towards HD (who quite honestly sucked as scum and therefore probably has at least one and conceivably both of his partners on his wagon) upon further review...by no means clear him and in fact, shine some additional suspicion on him. That coupled with the fact since he unvoted chkflp on page 5...the only vote Matt has had in play the entire game was on HD on D1. He [Matt] hasn't had a vote out since D1. Nothing all of D2 and nothing yet today. And whereas he was one of the most active posters on D1, he has significantly dropped in his contribution level to the game on D2 and D3.<br><br>I'm back to thinking Matt is scum (where I had my vote at the end of D1) and he has just lurked behind all the other activity the last two days.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Matt</span>"}

Not to say that ICE hasn't - but think about it this way. The fight between matt and chk consists of two sets of interactions - matt's actions towards chk, and chk's towards matt. If matt is town, then his interactions towards chk are going to be the same whether chk is town or scum - thus, it is impossible to distinguish between mattTown-chkTown and mattTown-chkScum <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">based only on their interactions.</span> Likewise, it is impossible to distinguish between mattTown-chkTown and mattScum-chkTown. Ergo, the only situation that can be distinguished from TvT <span style=\"font-style: italic\">solely based on their interactions</span> is SvS - that is to say that their interactions <span style=\"font-style: italic\">as a whole</span> cannot be used as a tell that would rule out TvT. It would be a legitimate argument to say \"matt's actions towards chkflip look like scum -&gt; town to me\" or \"chk's actions towards matt look like scum -&gt; town to me\", but to say \"this fight doesn't look like TvT to me\" without specifying how exactly it isn't TvT is just bullshit. Townies do it, which is sad, but it's a stupid argument - it's one of those things which is usually based entirely on gut without anything to back it up logically. Gut is fine, but it has to have some (at least vague or tenuous) basis in logic.</div></div></div><br><br>chk looks townier than he did after the fight with projectmatt - specifically, i think I'm just misconstruing bad play as scummy.

I think this gives him very mild townpoints at most though.

The problem though, is that Rob's defence of him is scummy too, as I think the whole \"every newbie is like that\" thing is very exaggerated as it's not something that I've seen at all. I could totally see this situation as Rob-scum, Mew-town as well. (I tend to think too obvious to be scumbuddies in these kinds of situations)<br><br>Oh, and I forgot about PMatt.

I looked over his ISO just now and he seemed to push two wagons primarily (Rob and projectmatt, the latter being mostly an early game push). I initially thought that scum were just being careless but thinking back it seems to have been a calculated decision. Suppose that Rob is something like a mafia rolecop - maybe he didn't buy denis's claim and wanted to check him to be sure and preferred to take out one of the few people who suspected him D1.<br><br>I get the idea that Rob was \"softing\" his report early D2 but I'm not so sure that's the case. Consider what Bub pointed out in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4677374#p4677374\" class=\"postlink\">this post</a> and Rob's justification <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4677424#p4677424\" class=\"postlink\">here</a>. Reading over that Denis/Rob interaction again, it doesn't really make sense as a \"normal' interaction as Rob put it. I know it's been pointed out but the way that line Bub quoted is phrased makes it seem like it's designed to make Denis look bad and the justification for it doesn't make sense to me - like, what kind of information could you possibly gain from that? And furthermore, Rob's response to me <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4685035#p4685035\" class=\"postlink\">here</a> feels off. He's already decided Bub is town so what would be the point of trying to gauge his reaction here? Overall, it feels like Rob's been flailing and trying to cover his own ass here.<br><br>I feel like this is all tinfoil hat stuff and I have like 0 confidence in my scumhunting right now, but yeah."}

Junpei's first mention of Rob is in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4618893#p4618893\" class=\"postlink\">#218</a> where he criticizes him for posting fluff but Junpei never follows up on this at all even when he claims he will (e.g., \"Will have to take a closer look at you\"). However, their back and forth regarding Denis' claim seems strange as partner-type stuff given something like <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4620035#p4620035\" class=\"postlink\">#249</a> + <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4620054#p4620054\" class=\"postlink\">#253</a>, where Junpei almost comes off like he's trying to discredit Rob's view of Denis' tracker claim. I'm not so sure I agree with DV that, at least on his end, Junpei doesn't appear to be trying to get a read on Rob -- I think their back and forths on Denis' claim and Rob's read on chkflip, Junpei approaches the conversation with a degree of skepticism that comes off like he's trying to get a read on Rob. I do dislike that there's nothing definitive there, though.

DV's point about Junpei and Rob simultaneously pushing the TH as a team seems weird too.<br><br>Basically, I'm not as confident in N's slot being scum as I once was coming into this day. One thing to note though: the Bub kill seems to come from someone who wasn't paying too much attention to the game (e.g, missing that Lincolm was a claimed PR and basically clear) so that kill could very well have come from N."}

When he later switches to Denis, he doesn't really provide a reason for Denis being town. I actually think mafia may be more self-conscious about switching their vote from a buddy and would feel the need to have a reason to call their buddy town/a reason not to vote for them. I think this is potentially weak too and maybe I'm wrong, but it's what I'm thinking at the moment. Oh, and just saw that it comes at a time when there is a PMatt wagon.

I'm sure he'd feel fine about being on PMatt with HD getting lynched. (Scum would feel like they are still tricking the town by actually being on a counterwagon on their buddy!!) and I only really see the vote on HD happening if he was voting for a townie beforehand. I feel like all these reasons I'm bringing up are possibly flawed, yet together I think they make it unlikely for PMatt to be scum.<br><br>Reading through I'm getting pretty paranoid and I'm kind of worried that the rudeness for a lot of the game was a scum ploy (I'm not sure what he's usually like as town. The one time I played with him was ages ago.), but I think he's town.<br><br>~~<br><br>So, I'd probably go for N today if it were up to me, but his play is making me less sure of him being scum."}

I think this is potentially weak too and maybe I'm wrong, but it's what I'm thinking at the moment. Oh, and just saw that it comes at a time when there is a PMatt wagon.

(Scum would feel like they are still tricking the town by actually being on a counterwagon on their buddy!!) and I only really see the vote on HD happening if he was voting for a townie beforehand.

Not to say that ICE hasn't - but think about it this way. The fight between matt and chk consists of two sets of interactions - matt's actions towards chk, and chk's towards matt. If matt is town, then his interactions towards chk are going to be the same whether chk is town or scum - thus, it is impossible to distinguish between mattTown-chkTown and mattTown-chkScum <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">based only on their interactions.</span> Likewise, it is impossible to distinguish between mattTown-chkTown and mattScum-chkTown.

Townies do it, which is sad, but it's a stupid argument - it's one of those things which is usually based entirely on gut without anything to back it up logically.

And DV's reluctant hammer just a few posts/hours after this one seemingly came from nowhere.<br><br>In summary...I do think the lack of interest from scum on the DV slot throughout the game...along with some possible prompting from Rob towards DV does shine a bit more suspicion on the slot. I could also see the hammer on Rob as an opportunity to get a little town cred from an outcome that was going to probably happen anyway.<br><br>So I'm talking myself into being more confuesed on the subject that I was. Yesterday I assumed if I made it to today and Matt was still around...that he would be my main suspect. Only thing is...if Matt is not scum...scum would be crazy to not bring me and him to LYLO. grrrrr<br><br>I'll take a closer look at Matt asap. I've made my suspicions of him pretty clear throughout the game so I probably don't need to expound on those much. I just have a nagging voice in my head saying he bussed the hell out of both his partners to get sufficient town cred to seal the deal if he made it to LYLO. Like he did in another game he won as scum (which I referenced ealier iirc). So Matt is perfectly capable of taking out both his partners for a win. I'll probably just look over how Breakfast/HD and Rob dealt with him throughout the game and see what that turns up.<br><br>I'm definitely more on the fence today than I was going into N6.<br><br>@DV...you promised some content <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4798198#p4798198\">over a week ago</a> but the closest thing I see to content is in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4800954#p4800954\">Post 1097</a> from last Wednesday.

But also in my head is the question...why would scum-matt take me to LYLO?  I don't think he would.  That said....I had to give due diligence to looking at DV and that's where I began to second guess my read on you.

I do not like it. I typically stay in 3-4 games at any given time because of what I suspect are ADD-related reasons. One game to focus on that draaaaaaaaaaaags and goes to night where I have to wait for 3 days before I can post again just isn't going to cut it. But more than 4 games and I become more useless than any of my detractors could ever accuse me of being. My point is...I do not have the time or patience to do deep digs into other people's meta so I usually do not. What I will do is go back in people's games to try and find distinct, clear cut examples of things that prove them to be liars or bussers. And I'm not calling you a liar. I'm saying for example someone says they have never done this or that or been in this situation or that...etc....and I look to see if they are telling the truth. So in your case I went looking to see if you were one who was prone to bus. In two of your relatively few games as scum...you bussed. And as I have mentioned...in one you bussed both of your team mates. Very nicely done by the way. And of course it makes me rethink my earlier assumption that because of your role in getting HD lynched...you were most likley scum. Are you potentially scum only for the fact that you have bussed before? Of course not. But because you have....you most certainly aren't a given to be town just becuase you helped vote 1...and then another...scum lynched. I would never look for anything beyond that in terms of playstyle...I just don't have the time or patience to do that sort of comparison. I would also say that you reacted pretty strongly to my suspicions towards you. You didn't OMGUS vote me or anything but you definitely came at (aka attacked) me hard.<br><br>Not having a vote actively up is something I look at with a grain of suspicion. Especially when it's for an entire gameday. Does it mean someone's scum?
