Why?</div></blockquote>RQS. I feel RVS is more-or-less fine as opening jokes, but the game really starts when actual discussion begins. Sure, some people often have reasons for their RVS votes, even if subconscious, but I think they're mostly just unnecessary and misleading as a scumhunting tactic. Actual scum will hide behind the 'randomness' of their votes, and a case can sometimes get rolling against a Townie for illegitimate reasons. I've read several games where Townies tunneled each other because of the OMGUS factor.<br>\n<br>\nOn the other hand, RQS (done properly) can get the ball rolling and give you some early insight into a person's methodology and style. Additionally, it can reveal who's going for fluff and who's going for content. Productivity=Townie, Counter-productivity=Scummy.\n<blockquote><div><cite>DarthYoshi wrote:</cite>How much Mafia experience do you have?</div></blockquote>Loads of experience in live games, but as I start playing in this format, I increasingly find that some of the skills I've learned there are completely irrelevant or actually bad for forum games.

First, if scum fakeclaim a PR and get CC&#8217;ed, great.  I&#8217;ll take a PR getting NKed on N1 any day if it means guaranteed scum gets lynched.  Smart scum typically claim a PR if they have to claim on D1 (wait, looks like Parama already covered this).<br>\n<br>\nSecond, smart PRs don&#8217;t claim VT.  They know it is bad for town for townies to fakeclaim.  There&#8217;s no WIFOM involved, the vast majority of the time town should be truthful when claiming.<br>\n<br>\nWhy is this an issue?  Because both you and Parama were actively discouraging an L-1 claim, albeit for very different reasons, and I tend to view such play as anti-town.  Not indicative of alignment in and of itself, but when coupled with other suspicious play, a surefire way to rocket up someone&#8217;s scumlist.  (BTW, Parama, I&#8217;m still interested to hear why you thought a claim was pointless, especially since you&#8217;re now making inferences based on SC&#8217;s VT claim.)<br>\n<br>\nAlso @Parama: First, do you think it is more likely that SC is &#8220;bad&#8221; scum rather than town?  Also, why should we lynch DRK?  You could have hammered SC, saying that you couldn&#8217;t isn&#8217;t accurate.<br>\n<br>\nSC&#8217;s vote of Parama in #78, rapidly after Pine&#8217;s Parama vote just follows his OMGUS voting pattern and is generally scummalicious, but I also think it means he needs to be lynched before Pine, as I think some of the suspicion of Pine has been largely based on the SC association.  If SC flips town, I think that may exonerate Pine to at least some extent.  If SC flips scum, well, bad news bears.<br>\n<br>\nThe ongoing discussions between DH/Pine look most likely to be two townies bickering; I&#8217;m not picking up any significant scumtells on either (aside from the SC association for Pine).<br>\n<br>\n@SC, you seem to be the only player who thinks EA is scum.

Not that it will likely do any good in dissuading you.<br>\n<br>\nRegarding tunneling: No one is immune to making mistakes that they call others on. Tunneling especially lends itself to not realizing you're doing it. Further, there's a big difference between accidental tunneling that you call yourself on, and intentional tunneling to get someone mislynched, like you're doing.

Not only Parama is active he is also agressively transparent. Do you get the feeling he is posting whatever the hell he wants rather than overthinking his posting like a scumbag would? Yeah, towntell all the way.<br>\n<br>\nPost 10 is a good example of this:\n<blockquote><div><cite>Parama wrote:</cite>SC, why is Pine scum?<br>\nPine, why is SC town?<br>\nFriend, why is Erratus scum?</div></blockquote>\nI like the agression of these questions. They are designed to make people take stances. Pure scumhunting and Parama doesnt care if SC, Pine or Fiend would attack him after forcing them on opinions they didnt necessarily have. Town.<br>\n<br>\nHis push on SC looks also sincere. Faking to have caught an scum and constantly making it look sincere is very hard as scum.<br>\n<br>\nPost 25 is Parama providing a townlist.\n<blockquote><div><cite>Parana wrote:</cite>LYNCH SC THEN DRK.

Putting SC to L-2 for no reason was null and now that he's given reasons, they're semi-valid reasons (which is fine for an RVS vote).  It's actually the list format that bugs me.  Presenting information in a purely factual way is an easy way to hide nervousness or being uncomfortable and the list format is a bit of a trick to make reasons seem like more than they are.<br>\n<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2887592#p2887592\" class=\"postlink\">Post 16</a> - Sigh.

It's probably as much a newb-tell as a scum tell though.  That's certainly a situation in which scum might want to jump off a wagon if they believed players were serious about it leading to lynch, but it's also a situation in which I'd expect a new player to jump off the wtfpage1 wagon.  Considering  would probably say that about a lot of his early posts, I'm going to avoid analyzing too many of his posts.<br>\n<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2887614#p2887614\" class=\"postlink\">Post 24</a> - Another very slight town tell from DH here.

As for why scum would be nervous in his position, as scum, he would find himself in a just slightly awkward position: either leave the wagon he started (that's since mostly fallen apart) or make a potentially awkward hop to Pine after not being there for the start of that wagon.  Sticking with SC is probably the more natural scum choice there (note: It might also be the more natural town choice, but I would expect town to be more likely to at least look in the direction of the Pine wagon at this point.)<br>\n<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2887988#p2887988\" class=\"postlink\">Post 39</a> - To be honest, I'm really starting to see where people could be getting a town read on Parama.
