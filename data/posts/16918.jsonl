Why?</div></blockquote>RQS. I feel RVS is more-or-less fine as opening jokes, but the game really starts when actual discussion begins. Sure, some people often have reasons for their RVS votes, even if subconscious, but I think they're mostly just unnecessary and misleading as a scumhunting tactic. Actual scum will hide behind the 'randomness' of their votes, and a case can sometimes get rolling against a Townie for illegitimate reasons. I've read several games where Townies tunneled each other because of the OMGUS factor.<br><br>On the other hand, RQS (done properly) can get the ball rolling and give you some early insight into a person's methodology and style. Additionally, it can reveal who's going for fluff and who's going for content. Productivity=Townie, Counter-productivity=Scummy.<br><blockquote><div><cite>DarthYoshi wrote:</cite>How much Mafia experience do you have?</div></blockquote>Loads of experience in live games, but as I start playing in this format, I increasingly find that some of the skills I've learned there are completely irrelevant or actually bad for forum games.

I have no idea why ANY of you are going along with what Parama is saying. At first, my only reason behind it was that those agreeing with the arrogance and impossible certainty was that they are scum, but there can't possibly be 3 or 4 scum. Narrowing it down to just the SOURCES of said arrogance and certainty, we're left with Parama and EA. What clinched it for me in the long run is his random decision to lynch DRK. <br><br>I cannot for the life of me fathom why more people didn't jump on that. If I were to suddenly decide \"Nevermind, let's lynch Tajo\" I'd be hammered before I could say \"just kidding.\" Parama does it(He just about used those words) and everyone just kinda...nods and moves on(I think Pine may have made mention of it, but it's late where I am, and I'm not certain)"}

First, if scum fakeclaim a PR and get CC\u2019ed, great.  I\u2019ll take a PR getting NKed on N1 any day if it means guaranteed scum gets lynched.  Smart scum typically claim a PR if they have to claim on D1 (wait, looks like Parama already covered this).<br><br>Second, smart PRs don\u2019t claim VT.  They know it is bad for town for townies to fakeclaim.  There\u2019s no WIFOM involved, the vast majority of the time town should be truthful when claiming.<br><br>Why is this an issue?  Because both you and Parama were actively discouraging an L-1 claim, albeit for very different reasons, and I tend to view such play as anti-town.  Not indicative of alignment in and of itself, but when coupled with other suspicious play, a surefire way to rocket up someone\u2019s scumlist.  (BTW, Parama, I\u2019m still interested to hear why you thought a claim was pointless, especially since you\u2019re now making inferences based on SC\u2019s VT claim.)<br><br>Also @Parama: First, do you think it is more likely that SC is \u201cbad\u201d scum rather than town?  Also, why should we lynch DRK?  You could have hammered SC, saying that you couldn\u2019t isn\u2019t accurate.<br><br>SC\u2019s vote of Parama in #78, rapidly after Pine\u2019s Parama vote just follows his OMGUS voting pattern and is generally scummalicious, but I also think it means he needs to be lynched before Pine, as I think some of the suspicion of Pine has been largely based on the SC association.  If SC flips town, I think that may exonerate Pine to at least some extent.  If SC flips scum, well, bad news bears.<br><br>The ongoing discussions between DH/Pine look most likely to be two townies bickering; I\u2019m not picking up any significant scumtells on either (aside from the SC association for Pine).<br><br>@SC, you seem to be the only player who thinks EA is scum.

Yeah, towntell all the way.<br><br>Post 10 is a good example of this:<br><blockquote><div><cite>Parama wrote:</cite>SC, why is Pine scum?<br>Pine, why is SC town?<br>Friend, why is Erratus scum?</div></blockquote><br>I like the agression of these questions. They are designed to make people take stances. Pure scumhunting and Parama doesnt care if SC, Pine or Fiend would attack him after forcing them on opinions they didnt necessarily have.

It's probably as much a newb-tell as a scum tell though.

Sticking with SC is probably the more natural scum choice there (note: It might also be the more natural town choice, but I would expect town to be more likely to at least look in the direction of the Pine wagon at this point.)<br><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2887988#p2887988\" class=\"postlink\">Post 39</a> - To be honest, I'm really starting to see where people could be getting a town read on Parama.
