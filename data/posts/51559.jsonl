Tonight, a round of Mafia would be played below the streets of downtown Los Angeles; its thirteen players, here by prearrangement, were gathered at the far end of the platform, where they would be boarding the final train out of Union Station. The game's objective was simple: Whichever of the town or the mafia still remaining on board by the time they arrived in North Hollywood would be victorious. With the weather forecast promising a particularly chilly night, the stakes were high, but that stopped no one from drawing their roles for the evening as the train pulled into the station.</span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Players</span></span><br><br>4nxi3ty<br>bjc <span style=\"font-size: 70%;

Somehow it's easier to talk in general terms about the game of mafia than to switch your vote around and prod people and search for information as scum. Dann has voted once, his random vote, then kept the fire going on SSK after that but never really stepped out. It's miles from his town meta.

The only quick thing about it is that I like to watch how people settle themselves into the game, the first couple of pages of the game are usually very interesting. First impressions and people being unsure about how this game is going to run makes it a nice place to look. The case is there, it's surprisingly substantial for something this early in the game, which is very nice. Not as if that happens all that often. <br><br>Otoh, a quicklynch is a wagon that suddenly takes off and completes to hammer before people on the wagon were really ready for it. They are a bit dangerous because it's hard to get info from the end of it, usually because scum have an easier time hiding if town is also being very easy about that sudden lynch. Hard to make sense out of. This is the opposite way. It took off quickly, but you know from all but justin why they are on there. And now it's going to stall for a little while people make up their minds. It's pushed by a case, it's stuff you can analyse. Hardly a quicklynch. It's quick, that's all, it's not dangerous. <br><br>It's also hardly a policy lynch. The policy would be scumtells that I see people commit, which I could even back up with some halflogic of how scum is nervous about the game, less inclined to hunt scum, and a bit more tightened up if they are not that experienced. <br><br>So, eh, wolfy, speak out in actual arguments why you are opposed here, in stead of calling it names. It's not a policy lynch, it's not bizarre, it's not a quicklynch. And those are all names you made up to tell us how we shouldn't be doing this, without actually backing it up with arguments. It's a bit pointless to oppose a wagon if you don't want to add to the discussion. Do your town duty, I'd say."}

Again, I elaborate on all of this during my D1. Also, you can't have your cake and eat it, too. You can't attack me for both me jumping on mykonian's wagon (the one rofl essentially established) and because rofl flipped town.

And each one has made me a little queasier than the last, with BJC's absolutely naked vote actually bringing bile into my throat (okay, honesty makes me admit I'm having a pretty dreadful bout of stomach flu, but even so).  <br><br>Zabriel's explanation makes some sense as a strategy but it still seems odd to bet against the judgment of someone you believe to be town in the way he has.  Zabriel, if MafiaSSK does flip scum would that make you disregard your previous read?  Would it make you more likely to see Nat as town?  You've pretty well said it would make you see the Steve slot as less townie, but the whole motivation of what you've done, so far as you've stated, is liking Steve's reasoning in the first place.  Plus I'm not really sure, if information is your goal, how Mafia would give you more information than Nat.<br><br>Nobody Special's whole iso at this point looks pretty awful to me.  On the other hand 4 seems to be right about this not being unusual. I'd still like some kind of explanation.<br><br>BJC.  Already making me take another look at Dannflor.<br><br>But I like both Quilford and 4 for town, and besides MafiaSSK's actually pretty awful behavior I'm not sure at this point that there's anyway we get MafiaSSK out of the town's eye without lynching him.  Plus having taken another look at Dannflor made me realize that the only person in town MafiaSSK has engaged with in depth was Dannflor.  People have been shooting at MafiaSSK from pretty much every direction and he's either ignored them or given them the most cursory replies.  But he dove right in with Dannflor.  As soon as Dannflor got a fifth vote though, MafiaSSK completely disengaged.<br><br>It's really strange behavior and behavior that's really hard to square with a town perspective.  I mean if town MafiaSSK really thought Dannflor was scum it seems like an odd point to step back, especially when Dannflor was still trying to engage with him.  No matter how you look at it MafiaSSK's actions here look more defensive than anything else.  Defensive in a way that doesn't seem to equal town.<br><br>Barring something extraordinary a MafiaSSK lynch is the best one today offers.  I'll second IceGuy in requesting a claim."}

You don't have to read everything to figure out a scum team. Ever played a game where someone caught fire and named the whole scum team like 10 pages in? Mafia isn't solely based on reading a shit ton of garbage and coming up to a conclusion, because scum can play well enough to negatively influence a town. Also, town can play bad/have bad players in the mix mucking things up, and judging by the fact that you've all <span style=\"font-style: italic\">yet</span> to hit scum, we're definitely dealing with one of the aforementioned situations. How could I be any worse? You've either got good scum play or bad town play or both, and I've yet to be able to decide what it is. So I won't be sheeping anyone, and as far as I can tell the only reason you're (essentially) threatening to scum read me is because I'm not blindly following you. I'm being punished for being skeptical, lol.<br><br>tl;dr I have more faith in my ability to read players than some random dude telling me to sheep him. As if the track record of lynches this game is something special..<br><br>For all intents and purposes I'm not reading anyone as town at the moment."}

Believe me, I am as frustrated as is possible with bjc.  It was the way you expressed it.  Normally when there's something I find odd that implicates two people I go after the stronger one first.  Back in the old days I found it was too easy to just role a weaker player whether they were scum or not whereas tackling the stronger both gave them a better chance of clearing themselves if they were innocent and removed a greater threat to town if they did not.  Plus, I am more than a little suspicious about your claim and your relationship with Nat does give me the willies.<br><br>But you know something?  I like you.  I like playing with you.  The last thing between you and BJC cuts both ways or it doesn't cut at all.  And it hasn't been fun playing with him.

It's not such a big deal when you bring light to the game on occasion, but 1 in 5 posts being throwaway posts is getting up there.<br><br>Nat <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5882229#p5882229\">14</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5882340#p5882340\">17</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5882390#p5882390\">21</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5882412#p5882412\">24</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5919429#p5919429\">373</a>: These posts imply that I am effectively an innocent child in Nat's eyes. This is certainly a far cry from voting me (as he is doing now). Words have meanings. If a player is sure enough of your alignment to call you the \"equivalent to claiming innocent child\" or state that \"scum don't claim miller\", then it's hard to believe this same player would do a 180 to such a degree and vote them two days later for reasons of expediency. I had no real qualms with this position, and I still don't. I do now that he has flipped on it for no substantial reason. His stated reason for flipping is that I haven't been responding to him, but I was absent from the entire site for the past three days. If Nat was serious about that argument, it stands to reason he would take the time to research whether or not it's a reasonable one.<br><br>Nat <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5885053#p5885053\">93</a>: This Dannflor vote was never backed up with reason. Nat didn't try to hide the fact that he was strictly following mykonian's orders, either. I have no idea what Nat's position on Dannflor/mykonian are at this point. This wouldn't be so bad except for that he doesn't attempt to justify this even after the fact. This vote on Dannflor is especially ironic given that he does it again in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5899634#p5899634\">269</a> (no justification). In neither instance does Nat ask questions/attack/try to convince others to join him in voting Dannflor. He even goes to great lengths to undercut his own votes (see: <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5888572#p5888572\">132</a>/<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5888589#p5888589\">134</a>). In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5915659#p5915659\">363</a>, he neglects to mention Dannflor at all, despite having voted for him twice at this point, and despite mentioning all nearly all other players in some fashion or another. By the way, he goes to great lengths to explain how I am strongly town in this post. Now, again, all of this wouldn't be so bad except now where is this game at? bjc (Dannflor's replacement) is being seriously talked about as scum. Nat is nowhere to be found in these discussions. Nat has yet to mention bjc at all, in fact. <br><br>Nat <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5898155#p5898155\">247</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5898512#p5898512\">253</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5899575#p5899575\">267</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5899634#p5899634\">269</a>: Nat's eventual joining of the myko wagon is undeniably strange, arguably scummy. Especially given the fact that he was townreading mykonian earlier in the game. I eventually moved the join the mykonian wagon myself, but I did so after careful thought. Nat in these posts looks like he's just broadcasting that he's going to eventually join the mykonian wagon, he's just waiting for the opportune time to do so. When he finally does join the wagon in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5899575#p5899575\">267</a>, the jump is anti-climatic. Worse, he claims to be joining the wagon based on a promise rather than anything substantial that mykonian did to finally tip Nat's vote. <br><br>Nat <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5915648#p5915648\">362</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5915659#p5915659\">363</a>: Nat's NS case is weak and based on two things. One is NS' playstyle, which should be obvious to anyone that has ever played with NS before, this is kind of null. His second point, however, is bad. NS' hammer was announced and appropriate at the time. Nat was voting mykonian. For Nat to criticize this hammer is disingenous and smacks of him blaming NS for mykonian flipping town rather than actually suspecting him of foul play.<br><br>Nat <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5938626#p5938626\">435</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5943029#p5943029\">451</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5951647#p5951647\">494</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5952718#p5952718\">503</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5962694#p5962694\">567</a>: In this short period of time, Nat votes three different people and criticizes a fourth. None of these posts involve Dannflor/bjc (one of his original suspects). The point I am making is that Nat is completely aimless. He has no clear direction and attacks/supports players based on whims. His support of my wagon in spite of the many, many posts where he calls me the equivalent of a mason or an innocent child is just more evidence of this. Nat is interested only in lynching, not scumhunting. That is motivation for scum or SK, but that is not motivation for town. It is not reasonable to vote three different players in such a short period of time without letting these votes have any effect on the players being voted. It's hopping that is steeped purely in opportunity. It's made to look like Nat is having internal struggles as to where he should vote, but the fact that he doesn't take the time to ask questions, read answers and follow up betrays this fact."}

I think the scum players did pretty well; they managed to escape suspicion long enough to last to LyLo, and they were a bunch who were complaining in the beginning about how bad they usually were as scum. You guys lurked just the right amount, too. Town also did pretty well, sort of. Some of you had some questionable decisions, and you <span style=\"font-style: italic\">really</span> shouldn't have lynched mykonian without a claim, not only because he was actually something interesting. Replacements could have killed this game, but (most of) you guys were absolutely wonderful.<br><br>Anyway, I designed the game around the bulletproof and masons this time around to focus on self-defense, except you guys killed everyone that mattered and the commuter role landed on a lurker. This is probably why design guides suggest not to design around a single role/interaction.<br><br>The replacement of zabriel at the beginning of Day 3 was actually a mistake, as Night 2 should have continued until the slot was replaced and then some. Props to Quilford for catching that.<br><br>A couple of other things:<br><br>1) Revealing the result before the game is officially declared over. There's no policy against this, but, IMO, it's really discourteous to the moderator to do this. I haven't done flavor at all for this game, so I don't have much of an excuse this time around to be pissed off; however, this sort of thing really ruins it for me, and it might ruin it for other people who like to read flavor, as well. So, please don't do it? This has happened two games in a row now, and I am seriously reconsidering moderating another game.<br><br>2) Replacements. Sometimes things happen, so if you gotta go, you gotta go. Just have the courtesy to let the moderator know so nobody waits around for 4 days because you couldn't give your fellow players the courtesy of ten bloody seconds of your time with a quick and dirty \"Replace me\" PM. Purposefully flaking out makes you a goddamn coward.<br><br>Most of you were really good about this, so a heartfelt thank you goes out to you all. Please continue to be sweethearts.<br><br>Lastly, if you are slacking and I ask you if everything is okay, I am legitimately worried about you. If you don't respond, I'm going to assume that you are being a jerk when you are posting insubstantial one-liners every two days. If you log into the site, pick up your PMs, and don't have the balls to reply with a simple \"Replace me,\" a heartfelt fuck you goes out to you. Really, why did you bother replacing in?<br><br>tl;dr - Most of you are wonderful. Fuck the rest of you.<br><br>My next game will most likely be a Mini Theme based on the video game <a href=\"http://www.papersplea.se/\" class=\"postlink\">Papers, Please</a>.

I was happy with all the players this game. I disagree slightly with our mod insomuch as her reference to the mykonian lynch. I have zero tolerance for not claiming. mykonian was brought to L-1 fair and square, regardless as to whether he felt it was \"justified\" or not. Refusing to claim as VT is somewhat justifiable on a case-by-case basis, but it's completely unacceptable to do so if you have something that can actually help the town. Easy call there to claim some random PR like a JK, Doctor or, if you don't want to take the risk, BP. In any case, I won't set precedent in any town game I am in to reward players by sparing them for refusing to claim. I like myko, but I strongly disagree with his decision there. I don't think either side played particularly strongly, but, again, what matters is we got there. <br><br>It's probably time for NS to just stick with modding. He's an excellent moderator.

I was not going to claim from that particular position. <br><br>I know RC is mad about this and in thread there has been some stuff going about that, and I've abstained to post about it in the graveyard. There were a couple of reasons why I didn't claim. There was no counterwagon, a claimed BP is a vt, it was day one, and a BP claim isn't a bad mafia fakeclaim. <br><br>I did not see a BP claim helping in that particular situation, given the way the day had gone. Given that there was not a great counterwagon going, I didn't think I should be so selfish to fakeclaim heavy power (and possibly draw a counter out day 1 already) and still run the risk of not avoiding my own lynch (given momentum). Claiming VT just because had similar problems that should I survive I didn't have a play out of it afterwards, given that scumroles tend to have bulletproof as a modifier more often.<br><br>All in all, the best course remaining that wouldn't put the town at an unreasonable risk for just my own wellbeing was to not claim (still keeping the possible usefulness of the BP) and hope for the best even if that was a tiny chance, it at least wouldn't fuck up something big which all other plays could do, which I still didn't think would give me a large shot at survival."}
