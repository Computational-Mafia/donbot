Depending on the circumstance, you may be able to paraphrase things I have sent you (such as a role PM). Use common sense and if you are unsure feel free to ask me via PM. <br>4) Be courteous to your fellow player. This is just a game - please don't bring personal grudges into the game. Try and keep it civil. If you cross 'the line' I'll step in. Said line will be judged by me.<br><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">&gt; Voting, Lynching &amp; Death </span><br>5) For your vote to be counted, it must be bold, and in the form <span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: Hoopla</span>. Caps and colons are optional, but it does need to be bolded. The vote tags are also appropriate for voting.<br>5a) Broken bold tags won't count. Mispellings or shortened names are ok as long as it is clear who you are voting. If I can't tell who you're voting, it won't count. <br>6) Unvotes aren't necessary before placing a new vote. Unvotes are necessary if you want to completely remove your vote. Please bold your unvotes or use the unvote tags. It is not necessary to name the player you are unvoting. <br>7) A lynch will occur when a player achieves 50% +1 of the votes - a majority. When this has happened, any subsequent votes and unvotes will not be counted, and the game will enter twilight. Night will begin as soon as I have declared the lynch. <br>8) You may vote for a no lynch if desired. If at least 50% of the players in the game vote for a no lynch, the game will progress to night without a lynch. <br>9) Once you're dead, you are dead. Do not post in the thread until the game is over, not even a 'bah' post. <br><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">&gt; Activity &amp; Deadlines </span><br>10) Treat this game as a commitment, and try your best to stay active. <br>11) Prods will be issued after 72 hours in a row without posting. If I keep having to prod you I'll get angry and replace you. Players may request a prod on another player too. I'm human and I may forget so if you want someone prodded just tell me. <br>11a) If you do not open a prod within 24 hours of it being sent I will begin looking for a replacement. <br>12) Things come up in life, if you need time off for something, please let myself and the players know in-thread for V/LA purposes. I will be flexible, but if you can't be here for a significant amount of time I will replace you. <br><span class=\"noboldsig\">13) Deadlines for each game day will be 2 weeks, except day 1 which will have a 3 week deadline. </span><br>14) In the event of a deadline ending without a player gaining a majority of votes, there will no lynch. No pluralities for lynching. <br>15) Nights will have a <strike>48</strike> 72 hour deadline. If you fail to send in a night choice, I will automatically default to 'no choice' for that night, and you will do nothing. The night scene may not exactly be up after <strike>48</strike> 72 hours, but give or take an hour or 10 and it will be. <br>16) Deadlines will only be extended if I need a number of replacements, or barring some other freak circumstances. Apart from that, laziness, or anything else, will not result in a deadline extension. <br><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">&gt; Other Information </span><br>17) <span style=\"color: #008000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span style=\"font-style: italic\">These are my colours and font I will use for modly purposes. All other colors are fair game as long as they are easily read by your other players/myself, just don't post a rainbow.</span></span></span><br>18) I will try to post Vote Counts as often as possible. Hopefully on the top of every page. If you feel a vote count is needed, don't hesitate to ask for one, and I'll provide one at the next opportunity. <br>19) It's more than possible I've missed a rule or haven't completely covered something. Don't be a prick and try to exploit it, or I will end your existence. Yes that means modkill.<br>20) I reserve the right to add more, or modify existing rules at any time. If this happens, I will let everyone know. <br>21) <span style=\"font-style: italic\"><span style=\"color: #800000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Flavour in night/day write up's is just that; flavour.</span></span></span> <br>22) No cryptography.<br>23) Have fun!</div></div></div>"}

That is the reason why everyone's votes are still on you and we're all pretty much in agreement that you will be the person lynched today.

If you were so certain Voided was going to be the lynch\u2026why did you keep your vote off him and instead maintaining it on a RV for Xalxe?  I also find it odd that in the very first post after pappum\u2019s claim\u2026that you call him out on potentially joking.  Why in the world would anyone of imagined that pappum\u2019s claim was a joke.  Are town fakeclaims on day 1 that common? [the answer btw is NO]  It\u2019s like you knew he was joking.  And perhaps he was joking in the right direction and you preferred staying off Voided\u2019s wagon.  I would think a PR claim of scum (until it was confessed to be a lie) would be a lot more of an indication of one\u2019s guilt than using as a reason the potential result from a lie\u2026which you are now using to vote pappums.<br><br>You are avoiding my questions and not being consistent with you gameplay.  I\u2019m torn between pappum and you now.  I think if pappum were to flip scum it would somewhat absolve you and Voided (though not entirely).

They would not have asked people to wait for pappums to answer questions, or asked the game to play out longer because a mislynch would mean an automatic day 2 wagon on pappums for not revealing the gambit sooner. Their best case scenario could be going into day 3 after two mislynches and minimal scumhunting. Even cautious scum wouldn't pass that up.<br><br>* If voided is scum, a buddy would have made sure to be on the wagon. Its as simple as that when you assume the day cop is real and voided is getting lynched no matter what.<br><br>In either scenario I count Jinxx, havingfitz, P.T.

That's not far off what the probable ratio of scum to town is for the entire game.  <br><br>And if we assume there was one scum off the wagon (and I would argue possibly two off the wagon if Void IS scum)....then you have to look at 1-2 of Voided, Jahudo, andrew, Neil, Jerbs (assuming he is still in the game), mikemike (is he still playing) and Idiotking.  <br><br>So basically you're saying in your theory...there is probably scum on and off Void's wagon.  <br><br>I would argue there is no guarantee there were any scum on Void's wagon given they had a claimed result on him (from possibly a townie) which was going to offer the opportunity for scum to lay back and let town do the lynch (whther it was on scum or town) without them having to join in (see neil).

The fact he asked for no quicklynch means nothing to me as I did not share his opinion on the matter.  IMO a confirmed scum so early on D1 was better off eliminated asap.  I\u2019ve given my reason in further detail and if people don\u2019t agree with them they are entitled to their opinions.  <br><br>As for immediately jumping on pappum\u2026I did this for a few reasons\u20261) My vote on Void was no longer for valid reason so I needed to unvote him.  2) My vote before I went to Voided was on pappums to begin with so without #3 it still would have probably gone back to him (pappums, and 3) pappums lied and wasted towns\u2019 time.  Yes\u2026the days events will still be of value later on but our time would have been better served IMO looking for scum and not having our play revolve around Void guilt (which true as it might be\u2026is deemed confirmed until the lie was confessed).  And I support the LAL policy.  <br><br>As for me rolefishing...wth are you talking about?  I didn't ask pappum or Void to claim.  pappum has said his result on Void was a lie but I do not recall whether or not he hass said his claimed role is a lie.  To ask if that was a lie is not rolefishing.  If that really is his role then IMO that would confirm that either pappum or Void is scum as I do not believe there would be a one shot day cop AND a neighborizor in a mini normal.  I would consider both of those to be unusual roles of which we can have only one.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>mikemike778 wrote:</cite>Well my take on it is that its pretty clear he would be drawing a big bullseye on himself by doing this.

Scum would never do that.  Or would they.  Pappums may or may not be scum but what he is\u2026in this instance at least\u2026is a confirmed liar.  That is enough in my book to lynch.  As for there being a \u201cgood chance he is investigated\u201d\u2026looks who\u2019s rolefishing now.  <br><br>As for your scum reads.<br>1)  I\u2019ve explained this in detail and stand by it.  Had pappums\u2019 claim been legitimate IMO a quicklynch of Void would have been in the town\u2019s best interest.<br>2) I\u2019m not writing off anything.  I think the time would have been better served not working under false pretenses which were introduced by pappum.  And as I have mentioned\u2026regardless of  the false pretenses\u2026the D1 events will still be of value later on.<br>3) How long should I have waited to vote the person I wanted lynched most?  Ridiculous rationale.  And you may condone lying and misleading town but I do not.  Lynching liars IMO is a safe bet.<br><br>And there was no mislynch in the bag when pappums claim was still considered legitimate.  If you have issues regarding the potential mislynch of Void you need to look at the cause of it\u2026not the people who believed pappum."}

However I don't agree with the L.A.L style of Mafia, so I can't justify lynching him just because he lied, despite how anti-town that is.

However there are better ways then this, and he could've single handedly caused a stupid lynch on perhaps a town PR, and then we'd be **** out of luck at the start of Day 2, especially if scum hit ANOTHER town PR during the night.

I said it in a way that nobody else seemed to get confused, so why did you? If it helps, I'll say it AGAIN this time in a way that even you can understand it:<br><br>I don't like that he lied. But I don't lynch all liars, because it's a lynch wasted usually. Townies lie because they are human. Humans lie. *gasp* yes Fritz I know... it's a hard concept to grasp. But follow me here.<br><br>So we've established already the fact that he lied in order to get a reaction. Now that this part is out of the picture, my difficulty with it is the fact that his lie could have gotten a townie lynched. Lying in and of itself isn't always anti-town as someone pointed out. Reaction fishing, isn't usually anti-town. HOWEVER... when you let it get to a point of a possible mislynch BECAUSE of your lie, then it becomes Anti-Town. Following?<br><br>So I don't want to lynch Pappums because he lied, but because of the implications the lie was very close to having. Get it? I hope so, because I am NOT repeating myself again. The fact that you've completely twisted this in your explanation of \"what I said\", helps my read of you as scummy. Why would scum purposely put a very simple concept, and twist it to make it difficult to understand?

That way I don't have to explain it to you much more, because gameplay discussions should be limited.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>havingfitz wrote:</cite>I also find it odd that in the very first post after pappum\u2019s claim\u2026that you call him out on potentially joking.  Why in the world would anyone of imagined that pappum\u2019s claim was a joke.</div></blockquote><br><br>Gameplay question again? Okay. Well you see, one needs to be careful. I was curious because of the current situation, and I had doubts as to why he would do the things he did if he was in fact what he claimed to be. So, I was hinting to him, that if it was a joke he is going to need to be careful with it. Mostly because I didn't want a townie lynched because of reaction fishing. Which, oh my gosh guess what? IT IS WHAT HE DID. Does it strike you as scum that I played that smart and didn't rush into it?<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>havingfitz wrote:</cite>Are town fakeclaims on day 1 that common? [the answer btw is NO]  It\u2019s like you knew he was joking.</div></blockquote><br><br>What about my post made it seem like I KNEW he was joking? What part of it hinted that I was SURE he was joking? And to answer your obvious first question, EVERY game is different, EVERY player is different. You can't pull out a statistic to try and explain someone elses gameplay. I don't count anything out of the game because \"it doesn't happen often.\" If you do that, you fall into this very limited bubble, and can get easily deceived by scum.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>havingfitz wrote:</cite>You are avoiding my questions and not being consistent with you gameplay.  I\u2019m torn between pappum and you now.  I think if pappum were to flip scum it would somewhat absolve you and Voided (though not entirely).  However\u2026if pappum were to flip town, my vote would be going straight to you (if it doesn\u2019t before then).</div></blockquote><br><br>If Pappum flips town or scum, please oh PLEASE do not change your read on me. I welcome your pressuring, and if you even LIVE throughout today, I can personally promise I will tear you apart piece by piece until all of your questions are finally answered in your thick skull, and we can both actively move on to scum hunting apart from each other. I'm trying, and I'd suggest you try too.<br><br>More to come for you. Give me a minute to follow the rest of your posts."}

I could've said \"arrogant jerk\" or \"ignorant jerk\" or \"blind-sided jerk\" and all would be acceptable. I don't mean it to be a shot on you as a person, but what your post seems to make you out to be. I'm saying it so that you could be careful in which you speak.<br><br> \"thick skull?\" Again, referring to a more one sided, tunneling outlook. Instead of being open and realizing, there's almost nobody here that's actually following you, you instead attempt to get questions out there by referring to the term \"we\" and \"us.\" As far as I've been concerned, there are people agreeing with my reads and if they are town, they are on my side. Now I apologize if anything I said was taken as a personal attack on you as a person outside of this game. I didn't mean for anything to come off that way, though I can easily see how my words could've been taken that way. However I assure you, nothing I said was on a personal, or even angry for that matter, basis. I'm enjoying this game, and I hope you are too.<br><br>All in all, I didn't lay out a case against you. That wasn't my point. My point was in disproving your statements, and proving that you are a hypocrite when it comes to your own \"policy.\" You lied, and I've explained it in my previous posts against you. I laid my cards out on the table that I had against you, in order that I may move on from you. Like I said, I don't believe you to be scum, just slightly anti-town. However, if you could take half the effort you put into me, and put it into scum hunting, I do believe you can be a great asset to the town when you choose to be. So my goal in the posts I made, were to make you come out and \"choose to be.\"<br><br>Lastly, about this whole \"fencesitting idea.\" You did not agree with Andrew did you? Please don't let it be so. Andrew's case is that because I basically called him out on a policy lynch, if nothing else, I'm scummy. He has no fencesitting case against me, because I am very careful where I put my vote. I acknowledged where I'd be putting my vote when the day came to, but I didn't want the day to end quickly so I kept the vote to myself during that moment. I WASN'T okay with a quick lynch. That's not fence sitting, that's technique. And now? How do you see right now as fence sitting? I'm still waiting for Pappums to come back before I move on. My vote is on him. My vote has spoken. You can't be fence sitting, when you're voting for someone. Voting is more powerful then the actual words themselves when it comes down to it. Fence sitting? Really? Oh dear, please don't ever settle for such a reaching, useless, and rather harmless case such as that against me. A little about me... I don't fence sit. Town or Mafia. Ever."}

You do not find me scummy and then proceed to lay out a case on me as to why I am scummy.  It seems like you want to have things both ways.

Someone pointed out that not all lies are bad for town.  I can agree with that comment and I could envision some instances where a lie would not warrant a LAL sentiment.  That does not apply to pappums\u2019 lie however.  His lie could have resulted in a mislynch and hypothetically\u2026if there was a cop of some sort in the game\u2026the lie could have forced a PR to out itself.  Then there could have been two roles  outted due to his lie (along with Voided\u2019s Neighborizor claim).  That is a lie worthy of a LAL IMO.  And despite your aversion to LAL\u2026in this instance your vote on pappums is a result of him lying.  You\u2019re trying to lynch a liar.<br><br>I think town would get more info from a pappum flip but I would be equally interested in seeing a neil flip.

The only other possibility that I can see (beyond it being the gambit he claims it to be) is an attempt to look town by doing something that would be incredibly stupid if done as scum.

If you almost got VM lynched and your role is town, you're not playing to your win condition so you deserve to be lynched for being anti-town. If you almost got VM lynched and your role is scum, then you're playing to your win condition but you should still be lynched because well.. you're scum. Either way, you don't seem to win in this situation, so how is my vote against you NOT pro-town?

You seem to have caught on to what OTHERS have said, and jumped on the wagon rather quickly. What about me do you find scummy in your own words? Other than what I've already explained? If you CAN'T state a half way decent case here (which, by the way, I don't believe you can), you can sure be prepared to be lynched for \"lurking\" and \"fluff accusations\" and then prepare to die scum. For next game, if you ever play scum again after this game, remember... you can't just ride the town wagons and repeat accusations and try to half-read my posts and make your own accusations, then make it seem like you're scum hunting. Because it's not scum hunting, it's repeating and showing you're not actually paying attention to my posts. Which is either an insult to me, or you're scum that doesn't really care about the town."}

Why did I not question pappums lie?  Typically when someone claims a PR...especially early in the game...I am very hesitant to believe them.  The reason I was willing to take pappums as legitimate was that he was implicating someone else and there was a way of confirming his claim.  IMO there would be no way someone would falseclaim a result on another player when there was a way of proving that result.  If VM were to have been lynched and turned out town...it would have been obvious (to me at least) that pappums was scum (or at the very least town not playing to the town's wincon).  I had no reason not to believe pappum based on the consequences I felt he would suffer if he was not telling the truth.  <br><br>Instead...he appears to be getting a pass from many of the game and instead there is a growing wagon on the person who was the most committed to believing him.  At this point the only people who know whether pappums and voided are scum are scum...so how can the possibility of one and two mislynches be a negative against me (due to my actions from believing pappums' lie) when one or both of pappums could still turn out to be scum?  <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Jahudo wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>havingfitz wrote:</cite>If we have identified scum it is in town's best interest to eliminate asap vs letting scum manipulate or assess town.</div></blockquote><br>You don't ask for pappums to confirm his thoughts, or question why he is delaying, so I have trouble believing why you take pappums for his word.

I don't have trouble believing him because if he had turned out to be lying...it would have implicated him (pappums) as scum.  Now with his admission that he lied and deceived <span class=\"noboldsig\">us</span> we no longer have that cut and dry (ie one of them has to be scum) situation.

Why waste everyone's time looking for scumbuddies (who should not be stupid enough to link themselves to Voided) with what could be assumed to be an honest claim &amp; result?  <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=16813&amp;user_select=11821\" class=\"postlink\">My ISO</a> 6-8 give my rational for a VM QL and I reiterate my belief that pappums has to be telling the truth in my ISO <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2873551#p2873551\" class=\"postlink\">12.</a>  I disagree that under the circumstances..if pappums had been truthful my sentiment was pro-scum.  As three others did as displayed by their actions if not their comments.  With the entire basis for my opinion being pappums' honesty...the fact he lied distorts any actions up to his confession as people (town at least...myself at least) were unknowingly operating on the basis of that lie. <br><br>@ all.  Why did I not question pappums lie?  Typically when someone claims a PR...especially early in the game...I am very hesitant to believe them.  The reason I was willing to take pappums as legitimate was that he was implicating someone else and there was a way of confirming his claim.  IMO there would be no way someone would falseclaim a result on another player when there was a way of proving that result.  If VM were to have been lynched and turned out town...it would have been obvious (to me at least) that pappums was scum (or at the very least town not playing to the town's wincon).  I had no reason not to believe pappum based on the consequences I felt he would suffer if he was not telling the truth.  <br><br>Instead...he appears to be getting a pass from many of the game and instead there is a growing wagon on the person who was the most committed to believing him.  At this point the only people who know whether pappums and voided are scum are scum...so how can the possibility of one and two mislynches be a negative against me (due to my actions from believing pappums' lie) when one or both of pappums could still turn out to be scum?  <br></div></blockquote>Pappums said not to quicklynch. Players were talking about the possibility of a gambit. The timing of his claim was in question. Those should be reasons to not blindly follow pappums to a hammer. At least to question pappums and get him to explain his thoughts more.<br><br>You say there's no point in trying to search for scumbuddies in that situation, but what is the harm in keeping the day open until everyone has at least reacted to the claims? These games typically last several months, they are meant to be slow. I don't think anyone's time was being wasted.<br><br>So have you never seen a gambit in one of these games?<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>havingfitz wrote:</cite>My comments towards pappums were made in regards to him expressing suspicions towards me...that has nothing to do with trust...that has to do with the knowledge he is off on his read. Which would be consistent IMO with my read on his early claim (which at the time I thought was truthful) and in fact now...consistent with his crap gambit.</div></blockquote>But you did acknowledge that his early claim was poor play, and yet you were eager to stay on the voided wagon. How was it not enough to make you at least distrustful enough to unvote, wait for everyone to react to the claim, and ask for a role confirmation from pappums?"}

See, here's my problem Pappums. As Scum, you could easily have planned this, to use that very excuse. Then, when it comes to play, you say the excuse, show how \"completely outrageous\" it would be for scum to do such a thing, and basically get a confirmed townie ride the rest of the game. One thing your plan didn't realize, is that I'm here. I've been scum more then I've been town, and I know EXACTLY how that mind set is, because I've done some similar things with EXACTLY the same motivation. Yes, you can say what you said and claim it to be outrageous but the fact of the matter is, you've done it, for the most part it was anti-town, and your a hypocrite. Allow me to explain why.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>pappums rat wrote:</cite>to believe havingfitz is scum, you would need to believe scum would want to policy lynch someone who he claims is a vi, thereby <span class=\"noboldsig\">bringing about a shorter day without any real scumhunting (which is good for scum)</span> <span style=\"font-style: italic\">and</span> <span class=\"noboldsig\">endorse quicklynching vm</span> after a suspicious early day one claim without scumhunting (once again, good for scum) <span style=\"font-style: italic\">and</span> <span class=\"noboldsig\">endorse lynching someone</span> for using a gambit under the pretense of lynch all liars without scumhunting (are we seeing a trend, here?).</div></blockquote><br><br>Not only are you blatantly twisting this case to overly make Fitz look like scum, but you're completely trying to pull the wool over our eyes. This is anti-town. Your three main points, is that Fitz is \"trying to end the day early with a possible quick lynch.\" The hypocritical part, is did you, or did you not almost get VM lynched with your \"Pro-Town Gambit?\" The correct answer is, yes. You were but a few posts away. The reason he's not lynched? You got LUCKY nobody else voted while you were away. So in reality, while Fitz may or may not have been wanting the day to end early, the fact is, he's only one person. You on the other hand, deceived us about your ability (not that you don't have the ability, but that you used it at that time), and VM was within inches of getting lynched because of it. That's a BIG difference. Now let me break the above post down for one second.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>pappums rat wrote:</cite>to believe havingfitz is scum, you would need to believe scum would want to policy lynch someone who he claims is a vi, thereby bringing about a shorter day without any real scumhunting</div></blockquote><br><br>Except for one small fact you seemed to conveniently overlooked. He was clearly in context, referring to if the day came down to a quick lynch, he'd like to propose someone that is a VI in order that though we may not know much, at least we'd get a future potential disaster out before that goes down. And who knows? He may flip scum.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>pappums rat wrote:</cite>endorse quicklynching vm after a suspicious early day one claim without scumhunting (once again, good for scum)</div></blockquote><br><br>You DO realize you just accused him for believing you basically? It's not suspicious he believed you, it's suspicious that you'd be so deceitful friend. And what do you mean a suspicious early day one claim? Not many thought it was suspicious except maybe myself, and a FEW select others.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>pappums rat wrote:</cite>endorse lynching someone for using a gambit under the pretense of lynch all liars without scumhunting (are we seeing a trend, here?).</div></blockquote><br><br>You keep saying he's not scum hunting. Have you read his posts? I'd strongly disagree. Anyone who reads his posts, will also strongly disagree. Though yes, he has his annoying moments, and his long posts can get tiring to read, you couldn't even BEGIN to argue the fact that he is indeed scum hunting.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>pappums rat wrote:</cite>the whole point of my gambit was to see the reactions people would have to there being a confirmed scum cornered, and then after the gambit was lifted people could scumhunt by looking for suspicious reactions. havingfitz has made every attempt to make this day shorter than it should be, which is antitown and scummy. the fact is that havingfitz has done no real scumhunting at all, and has been avoiding doing so all day. <span class=\"noboldsig\">obvscum is obvious.</span> moar votes plz.</div></blockquote><br><br>Again, you've completely misrepresented him, deceitfully made a case against him that for the most part is false, and now are calling for a lynch of your own? Hypocrite! You're right about one thing though... <br><br>Obvious scum is indeed obvious, which is why my vote is on you. Your falty, weak, and deceitful case against Fitz now confirms my suspicions on you."}

You devolve into childish antics when confronted by the revelation that it was a gambit.  Strange that you were happy enough to go with the flow and lynch voided, but when that changes, you lash out against pappums for lying.  Tell me, what good reason would pappums have for revealing the gambit if he were scum?  I know of one, but I want to see what conclusions you reach.  As far as the bolded section is concerned, I'm talking about how you switch from being blindly sure that pappums is telling the truth to being blindly sure that he is scum.  The important word here is \"blindly\".  You seem determined to focus in on only one possibility, no matter the situation.  Why?  And yes, pappums admitted to lying.  I am generally pro-LAL and anti-gambit.  In this case, however, there is only one way that I can see pappums being scum, and just as many ways that he is town.  Thus he is neutral, regardless of the lie.

Quicklynches are scumtells.  Quickly changing one's opinion and lashing out because of it is a scumtell.  It means you're not taking the time to think things through.  Acting on impulse is scummy."}

Does it matter that I have seen people claim PGO on D1 to avoid night actions (both as town and scum)?  I have obviously seen scum fakeclaim PRs...usually to no avail.  I have also seen town make dreadful PR claims which usually resulted in their lynching (when caught), some of which have forced the real PRs to counterclaim and out themselves.   None which implicated another player that I recall though.    <br><br>Of the gambits you have provided, the Karma game was a good example but is not like this game in that 1 ) it occurred on the 3rd day when players had had a chance to assess/form opinions on each other and 2) ABR allowed his claim to result in a lynch (which he got lucky with).  Karma was similar to this game in that two players immediately (blindly?) laid down votes following ABR's fake claim.  No gambit talk or anything...and the voters were town. <br><br>The 2nd game you provide (which is ongoing so I am hesitant to discuss too much) was a similar \"gambit\" in that it occurred D1 (albeit later in the day) but was different in that two players were implicated...so there was still debate to be made.  I would not have advocated a ql in this case.  It should also be noted that votes were immediately cast as a result of the gambit, it only went on for 7-8 hrs, the gambitor somehow knew his targets alignment (??he called them both town??) AND the person suspected as a result of the gambit and lynched D1 was town.  I also note that you and pappums are in that game.<br><br>As for the 3rd game...which I note you are in...if the fakeclaim I think you are referring to is correct...it was that someone else was town.  Hardly the type of vote that would immediately produce a lynch so not relevant to this game.  If your were referring to a different fakeclaim in this game please feel free to point it out.<br><br>The fact is though...I have not been in a game where town fakeclaimed a PR that implicated someone else as scum and was therefore easily  proven.<br><br>Also...has anyone been in a game where given the result of a lynch...a town entering MYLO immediately conducted a No-lynch without discussion (ie a ql)?  That was the same effect I was proposing with our post-lie/pre-confession ~confirmed scum Void.<br><div align=\"center\"><hr style=\"height:14px; width:50%\"></div><br>@cecily.  What?  IK and pappums cases on me are pathetic.  Please state yours after you have read theirs and my responses.  And why do you state you think pappums is not scum and then follow that up by discrediting his 'gambit' plan?  That makes no sense as does (not) your vote on me.  Please state your case.  If you are lazy time-consumed town, do town a favor and replace out.  Otherwise play to your wincon (which if you are scum you are doing well atm)."}

How would you describe your play style?</div></blockquote><br>I like RQS as introductions of new players, so I'll answer these from way back at the start of the thread.<br>1) I keep batshit crazy hours, EST. A student's schedule allows me to sleep late, stay up, and generally let my natural circadian rhythm dictate my sleep/wake cycle, so long as I make class on time and don't fall asleep during it.<br>2) I have a <span style=\"font-style: italic\">lot </span>of experience with the live version of the game, but only about 50% of what one learns in the live game is applicable in this format. I'm a new scummer and still adapting. Lately I've found what works for me is to focus on one person at a time, dissect and analyze everything they do and have done, and see if a case holds together. If it doesn't, I move on. I'm generally not a fan of popular wagons or sheeping, but if I feel it is justified or that someone needs pressure, I'll hop on. As each day phase winds down, I will look at the feasible lynches and go with the best choice, regardless of whether they're my current target. I'm fond of walls, but also of short remarks on other peoples' posts. I detest lurking and non-contribution, and I don't like speed-lynching until the day begins to stagnate. Also, I don't think Xalxe was an especially effective player, so don't be surprised if I am radically different in opinions, votes, and style to him.<br><br>On to my first vote!<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Xalxe wrote:</cite>...<br><br>jeez pappums, and here I thought we had a scum wrapped up 100%.  Now it's only, like 50% or so.<br><br>My reaction: pappums is town.  If he were scumgambiting, he would have no reason not to let the wagon run its course and then claim \"lol insane cop my bad lololololol.\"  So yeah.<br><br>Voided...is iffy, I really need to reread his postings.<br><br>Also, <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: Voidedmafia</span></div></blockquote><br>I completely disagree with my predecessor. Not only could and would scum do this, but this could be a near-brilliant scum tactic. Ramp up a wagon based on a PR claim, get the victim super-defensive. \"Confess\" at the last minute, because as we all know, there are no insane cops in Normal Minis. If he HADN'T confessed, he'd be immediately lynched D2 for being exposed in an irretrievable lie. The way he did it, he's seen as towngambiting. I don't buy it. Lynch All Liars, because there was NO Pro-Town reason for this gambit at this time. My interpretation is reinforced by post 179.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: pappums rat</span><br><br>PR is either scum or <span style=\"font-style: italic\">counter</span>productive town. Either is an acceptable D1 lynch.<br><br>I could also support a Jerbs wagon to nudge him into a more productive state, but I've played with him before and this IS his established meta, though I find it illogical and unproductive."}

In my eyes, its the unwillingness to let the gambit go as simply a way to provoke everyone to talk about things.

It is not the only reason my vote is still on him.<br>2) Are you saying scum can't do things to provoke discussion?  Ridiculous.  And you are saying I am voting pappums because I do not like discussion and I am holding it against him?  That is a faulty analogy.  I would also note that you have not mentioned one word of suspicions towards me (that I can find) until the post you decide to vote for me.  Despite at various points suspecting Voided (and keeping your vote on him for a few days after the lie was confessed), neil (for saying mean things) and out of nowhere...me.

For being against discussion:<br><blockquote><div><cite>Cecily wrote:</cite>that said I don't think we need to wait the entire continuation of this day unless someone is going to admit to being scum, and I think it would be more useful to learn if Voided is actually scum or not <span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">before continuing on with deliberations over who his buddies are.

How does that make your and my actions any different?  Are you even thinking about what you are posting????  I've given my reasons for wanting an early D1 scum result to have a quicklynch.  You were just as quick to vote him and echoed my sentiments with this comment:<br><blockquote><div><cite>Cecily p160 wrote:</cite>I don't think we need to wait the entire continuation of this day unless someone is going to admit to being scum, and I think it would be more useful to learn if Voided is actually scum or not before continuing on with deliberations over who his buddies are.

So why are my actions with regard to pappums' lie (which your comments/actions were in line with) all of a sudden voteworthy?  I have not advocated any sort of quicklynch since pappums \"came clean\" so if you are inferring that you would be misrepping me.  If you aren't inferring that then why are you voting me?  And of course I think lynching someone [scum] is the best course of action...isn't that the object of the game?  Trying to push a lynch is scummy?

Those were my reasons, I clearly stated them before pappums came clean, and I'm not going to go back and try and change that.</div></blockquote> <br>No...but last thing you said in your ~explanation for voting me was  <span style=\"font-style: italic\">\"Pushing a quicklynch without much information is very scummy.  And that's why I'm voting fitz.\"</span>  Which is hypocritical considering you were advocating the same thing I was.  <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Cecily wrote:</cite>You were pushing a quicklynch on voided before pappums claimed, as was I because when no scum is willing to associate himself with voided it's pointless to try and drag it out. All that would get us is pissed off townies and less helpful information than we started with.</div></blockquote><br>What is your point?  This is what I have been pointing out to everyone and it supports my comments just above. ????<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Cecily wrote:</cite>I'm calling you out on your obscene willingness to lynch pappums now. You've been jumping around pointing at pappums saying he's scum, he's scum, but all you've been focused on is his gambit. The rest of us are over it, moved on to something more worthwhile - the stuff that came out of his gambit. And you are sitting on something that you know to be a safe platform to lynch from. You're using his gambit as an excuse for his lynch which would be fine if there weren't other people who looked scummier.</div></blockquote> <br>What is obscene about wanting to vote someone?  That's the point.  I do think pappums is scum.  I have not focused only on pappums lie (which you immediately absolved him of and cleared him for it)...if you have been paying attention I have pointed out several other suspicions I have on pappums.  Nice misrep.  And I have looked at other players (ironic you haven't noticed).    <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Cecily wrote:</cite>Notice how the rest of us have pretty much gotten over his gambit and are now on to making claims based on people reactions to it. You aren't. Because steering yourself to a topic other than his gambit is dangerous, because as soon as you relieve him of that guilty claim there is nothing else to go on. I am past his claim, and I see something else... you.</div></blockquote><br>Still a MISREP.  You're repeating yourself.  See my last comment above.   <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Cecily wrote:</cite>And I will call you on contorting my quotes. One was taken from before pappums came out, and the other was after. As I have clearly stated my intentions do differ between those times and so quoting both times and trying to draw the same conclusions out of them is ludicrous.</div></blockquote> <br>You aren't doing anything other than saying you are calling me out.  Which comments am I taking out of context or out of order?  Not the neil unvote quotes...those are there for all to see.  Which quotes do you refer to?<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Cecily wrote:</cite>Let me make myself perfectly clear. I do not hold your vote on voided against you. I do not hold your willingness to quicklynch voided against you. I <span class=\"noboldsig\">do</span> hold you unwillingness to accept pappums gambit as simply a gambit against you.</div></blockquote> <br>It wasn't a gambit against me....it was a lie against voided that could have resulted in a potential mislynch and it is not what I am focusing on.  And as for not holding my VM vote against me....what are you referring to in the <span style=\"font-style: italic\">quote</span> I italicised earlier in this post?  &lt;headshake&gt;<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Cecily wrote:</cite>I completely agree with the frustration pappums felt that led him to quoting cee lo green. Seriously. And claiming that he said it out of anything other than sheer frustration will lead me to ask what kind of life you've been living that you've never wanted to express those feelings and how can I get in on it?</div></blockquote><br>Et tu Cecily?  So essentially you are telling me the same thing pappums rat did but in a checken shit manner.  Just say it.  Coupled with all your apologies to <span class=\"noboldsig\">us</span> for this and that you are trying too hard not to offend/annoy.  And do you really feel the need to act that way (like cee lo) based off pressure from one person (moi)?  Shame.  If you feel the urge to curse others out for gameplay on a mafia site I can only hope your life improves and you eventually get over it.   <br><br>So why were you voting me again?  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":-)\" title=\"Smile\">"}

Barnum", "content": "Tomorrow I'll cover the players I'd prefer to be lynched.  It's frustrating to have one's top two suspects replace out, so this game is hard to get into.  I really just need to reread.  Here's at least something, my stance on the current two wagons:<br>1. The fitz wagon is nonsense, as far as I'm concerned.  The only thing I have ever disliked about his play (and it was a significant strike against him) was his suggestion of andrew as a policy lynch.  The more andrew posts, the less wary I am of that.  He's been posting and responding very much like I'd expect him to, and he's been scumhunting, which is more than I can say for other players.  His post #272 is a particularly good one against pappum, whose claim that being called a liar is a personal attack is baloney.  <br>2. That being said, I'm not sold on pappum's scumminess.  For one thing, I don't necessarily disagree with his gambit.  It's steered this town in a good direction.  I'd much rather lynch voided, as I said before, who hasn't really done anything since his wagon. Nonetheless, I have some problems with pappums's behavior <span style=\"font-style: italic\">after</span> he revealed his gambit:<br><blockquote><div><cite>pappums wrote:</cite>all right folks, here's the dealy-o. to believe that i am scum, you would have to believe that scum would be willing to pull a suicidal move like that and at the same time repeatedly tell people not to mislynch and tell everyone your pm said you were sane (giving you no option to claim that your sanity was not assured after the supposed vm townflip). </div></blockquote><br>His would not be the first gambit that the mafia ever faked.  What makes this scummy is that pappum's is insistent on reminding the town that because he played that gambit, he can't be scum.  The fact is, his stunt has bought him a lot of leverage, which he is using transparently.<br>Secondly, I don't like how terse his tone is when discussing with havingfitz.  His rudeness is over-the-top, particularly \"Fuck you\" and calling his posts \"rehashed bullshit.\"  It comes across as being a little faked.  <br><br>I'm not voting him yet, as I need a reraed (as I said before)."}

Then when he admitted to deceiving and lying to town, kept his vote on VM (despite no good reason att) and his subsequent OMGUS vote on me, it only supported my opinion that he was either scum or just incompetant town.  However, the possibility that he is incompetant town has me bothered.  I would like him to be gone because of his bad play and the fact he is being a dick (if that's hurling an insult so be it...it's also a fact).  However....if he is town...then both leading wagons are on a mislynch and there will IMO be nothing to be gained from analyzing either of our wagons.

I would already be a popular candidate based on my current wagon so not being on a potential PRtown lynch would just put more scum in the spotlight.  And if is isn't obvious from what I am saying above...I am saying I am town-aligned."}

He seemed to take it as an attack on the town (which could be one way to interpret it), yet reacted much more forcefully than what everyone else expected. Up until a few posts ago, that was the scummiest behavior out of anyone in here and like I pointed out initially I like to assess people based off of how they react, not necessarily what they say.

If I'm sticking with my original argument of voting based off of how people react, then his last post consisting of only obscene remarks definitely takes the cake.

I will remind everyone that it does not take vulgar language to attempt to insult someone and violate the site guidelines, nor is baiting a justification for making an insulting comment in return.<br><br>TBH, games don't often get out of hand and I didn't really expect it to be a problem.

Five posts you have made.  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif\" alt=\":roll:\" title=\"Rolling Eyes\">    You've made almost as many posts (4) in other games/threads just in the last ten hours <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif\" alt=\":!:\" title=\"Exclamation\"> <br><br>And Cecily...I see you lurking as well.    <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_igmeou.gif\" alt=\":igmeou:\" title=\"IGMEOU\">"}

He seemed to take it as an attack on the town (which could be one way to interpret it), yet reacted much more forcefully than what everyone else expected. Up until a few posts ago, that was the scummiest behavior out of anyone in here and like I pointed out initially I like to assess people based off of how they react, not necessarily what they say. I agreed with pappums \"fuck you\" because the walls and baiting that fitz does are obnoxious and do seem at times to be mostly just to piss people off. <br><br>Now, pappums is the one with overly emotional responses. If I'm sticking with my original argument of voting based off of how people react, then his last post consisting of only obscene remarks definitely takes the cake. And because it will probably come up, I only defended pappums in his reasoning for the gambit. If anyone wants to call me out now for something else, please do, I may have forgotten, but defense of his actions was solely reserved for the gambit.<br><br>I repeat, I was not consistently defending him, only agreeing with his reasons for voting fitz, so no fair calling me out on that for switching my vote.<br><br>unvote<br>vote: pappums<br><br>And I don't have time or energy to go over other people right now so, sorry.<br></div></blockquote><br><br>Bold is mine.

Because that has happened. I'm not down for something like that again. <br><br>I'm split between these two main wagons because, like I've been trying to get others to focus on, one or the other will most likely be lynched this day and I don't see the point in voting anyone else unless they really screw up. Both players have scummy aspects to them, and there is a chance that I'll switch my vote again, because the point of this game is to vote the person you think scummiest and that is what I'd like to do without being scrutinized for it. <br><br>Having said that, I don't like fitz's targeting of neil. Not that I'm saying neil is obvtown, but it really is seeming like he's only focusing on people who speak out about him. By tomorrow he could have even more people added to his list of 5 already possible scums, just because they question him. It's pretty much like he's saying \"I'm right and anyone who disagrees is obviously my enemy\" which is not protown at all. The point of having long days like this is to encourage discourse and to allow people to think about who they trust or not, and while it sucks having people think you scummy, there's no reason to go out and attack all of them. People have differing opinions, and that's life and attacking them is definitely not protown behavior. <br><br>And woah I'm glad we had replacements in this game. We all pretty much totally overlooked those connections, thanks nacho. Those are some pretty convincing arguments and I must say I'm almost willing to change my vote over them.

Everyone is enjoying a silent, peaceful night, until... The loud rumbling of an industrial diesel engine engulfs the neighborhood. The neighbors stir, but don't waken. At least not until the crack of the wreckingball crashing through Voidedmafia's front door is heard. Now you're all awake, all of you except <span class=\"noboldsig\">Jahudo</span> that is. While most of you quickly head to the basement to attempt to escape the certain doom of the wrecking ball flying through your window next, Jahudo lays in bed peacefully with a smile on his face and his headphones blaring. <br><br>It's too bad he was not able to hear the whoosh of the wrecking ball being pulled back into attacking position. The chains moaned under the stress, and then, Bam! In one instance, half of Jahudo's house is gone. While he may have been unable to hear the destruction, the impact shakes the remainder of the house off the foundation and tosses Jahudo onto the floor. Within seconds, he's up and running. Down the stairs. Smash! Another section of the house disappears behind him. The front door is in sight. He rips it open only to find he staring at 50 tons of cold, black iron heading right towards him. Like a scene out of the Matrix, he's on the ground and the wrecking ball swings just above him, destroying the rest of the house. He stands up, relieved, and wipes his brow. Ooops, shoulda looked back. The rebound swing of the wrecking ball drives through jahudo as if he weren't even standing there, and launches him into the night sky.<br><br>But all the rest of you hear is the smashing of a second second house, followed by silence as the diesel engine shuts down for the night. The silence doesn't help, none of you sleep much in the next 3 hours before dawn. At dawn, you all head out curious to see what the commotion was about the night before. You notice voided's house is gone, expected due to the previous days activity. But you also find a pile a rubble where jahudo's house used to be. But no Jahudo (somewhere, approximately 3/4 of a mile a way in the forest, his remains dangle from the branches of an oak tree, never to be found). You search the rubble, searching for any clues. All you find is a note:</span></span></span><br><br><div style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"color: #FF0000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">We WARNED you. Take your stuff, leave now, peacefully.

Heh. ITT I fail at math; I honestly thought you were within idiotscum (not to be confused with idiotking) quickhammah range. Plus it was a random vote anyway, and we've got a bit more info now.\u201d which I don\u2019t buy at all. He had TWO votes - how could he possibly have thought he was within quickhammer range?

Also, odd that he\u2019s finally bringing up the post where PT Barnum defended him and calling it scummy.<br><br>-xalxe 143 wanting to end the day early. post reads as though he knows pappums is gambiting<br><br>-post 150 makes me think havingfitz could be town. I think scum, knowing voided would flip town, wouldn\u2019t push ending the day early so hard <br><br>-xalxe defends pappums and says there is no scum motivation for his gambit (when there is, obviously. gambit for town cred, coming clean to avoid being lynched D2 after voided flips town.)<br><br>-neil calls him on this and says \u201cHow on EARTH could you make such a solid comment with so much clarity, unless of course you know who the scum and who the town are? In which case, that'd make you Mafia. Could this be a scum slip? Anyways may I ask you, apart from the obvious \"reaction fishing\" fallacy, how on earth do you see this at all to be town motivated?\u201d<br><br>-It's unlikely that scum would defend a buddy so blatantly, so probably xalxe is scum and pappums is town<br><br>-Jahudo said in post 210 \u201cIf voided is town, scum had great incentive to get a hammer before pappums revealed his gambit. They would not have asked people to wait for pappums to answer questions, or asked the game to play out longer because a mislynch would mean an automatic day 2 wagon on pappums for not revealing the gambit sooner. Their best case scenario could be going into day 3 after two mislynches and minimal scumhunting. Even cautious scum wouldn't pass that up.\u201d<br><br>-Then Jahudo\u2019s logic in 243 is that scum would\u2019ve felt comfortable on the wagon and comfortable calling for a quicklynch. <br><br>-I disagree completely and think the opposite of his conclusion is more likely. The fact that pappums had claimed an investigation would actually make scum more wary of being on the wagon, not less - the scum still knew voided was town (and therefore knew it was a gambit - either that or pappums is scum so they wouldn\u2019t want to blatantly link themselves to it) so they would have been extremely hesitant - more so than regular wagons even. Xalxe and P.T.

Avoids commenting on much and says he wants pappums killed for lying.<br><br>-PT post 270 says \u201cFair enough, though if I had been scum I probably would have assumed that voided was an SK. Pappum's claim as a gambit is still surprising to me.\u201d This is interesting. I doubt any of the townies considered that pappums might have caught the SK. The fact that Pappums says this makes me wonder if this was his genuine reaction to Pappums gambit. He thought Pappums had found the SK. In spite of this, I think scum still would've been pretty hesitant with the wagon, since though they'd consider SK they'd know it was way more likely to be a gambit.<br><br>-Idiot\u2019s reasoning in 281 and 283 for thinking fitz is scum is exactly why I think he\u2019s town. He says \u201cHe absolutely believed that pappums was town when pappums claimed cop, which is just a poor conclusion to reach, given that it could have been (and was) a gambit or a lie.\u201d Only a townie would do that, because scum would know it was almost definitely a gambit.<br><br>-neil 304 reads townie<br><br>-Pine\u2019s first post 316 pretty much confirms pappums as town and pine as scum. 332 is scummy - wants to end day early with pappum lynch and says his gambit gained no info. BS.<br><br>-TO\u2019s initial post raises flags for declaring pine town<br><br>-pine 364 scummy - discusses mafia strategy and then unvotes and revotes pappums. fluff disguised as content<br><br>-Pine 366 is scum guaranteeing a safe place on both leading wagons<br><br>-371 - Pine guages town\u2019s support for his mislynch of pappums<br><br>-pine\u2019s post 396 \u201cFitz has convinced me that Cecily should be suspect #1 on D2.\u201d lolsheeping<br><br>-Jahudo\u2019s post 401 re: Pine\u2019s scumminess is win. This post is probably why Jahudo was NK'd. (*high five* for drawing a NK as VT, Jahudo.)<br><br>-Pine\u2019s post 478 accusing TO of waffling and basically instructing her to vote (and the fact that TO ignored it completely) indicates a scum link between TO and Pine<br><br>-Pine\u2019s 487 is uber scummy. He says \u201cI'm worried that if we wait for a replacement on PR, they're going to use the slack we all subconsciously give to replacements to their advantage. In my mind, PR's spot is confirmed scum, and I am concerned that a replacement is just going to wriggle out of it.<br><br>-Hammer, please.\u201d So not only is he trying to get pappums hammered before replacements can weigh in, didn't he earlier accuse others of being scummy for this exact thing (getting rid of a player about to be replaced)? - Need to look back at this.<br><br>-Post 492 Pine indicates the game has 2 scum (he says getting his scum read pappums lynched would make it a \"one scum game\". Especially where it seems more likely there'd be 3 scum, this reeks of inside info.<br><br>-Post 504 TO votes Pine without giving a reason and says she\u2019ll move her vote \u201cto where it will count\u201d the next day. Pretty obvious and poor attempt at distancing.<br><br>-525 Nacho puts the first vote on Voided. I'm very interested in this wagon, as scum would be motivated to make it happen as they know Voided is a PR that will be confirmed D2.<br><br>-andrew had given me mostly town vibes but chkflip\u2019s logic for supporting the voided wagon is weak.<br><br>-bub 540 is townie, but he should\u2019ve gone with Pine instead of Neil.<br><br>-Pine 544 doesn\u2019t address Bub\u2019s points against him but instead disagrees that both wagons are unlikely to be scum.<br><br>-Neil asked voided if there\u2019s a way to test her role claim. This was a townie mindset.<br><br>-Nacho had pretty solid reasons for restarting the Voided wagon. P.T. Barnum\u2019s 573 is more sketchy. Mike makes a good point about it when he says, \u201cIf the neighbor-neighborizor thing was enough to lynch him on its own as you've said and said then why vote for Andrew here ? Seems a very woolly vote really...\"<br><br>-Pine 577 again is scummy. Says he\u2019s lurking because Nacho is a good player who might be able to worm out of the wagon. This makes more sense as a reason to be really active and posting to keep the pappums/Nacho wagon strong if he really thought he was scum, rather than a reason to hide. Pine should\u2019ve just posted \u201cI\u2019m lurking because I\u2019d absolutely love a Voided wagon but don\u2019t want to draw suspicion by moving off Nacho and onto Voided, so instead I\u2019ll just sit back and let things happen naturally.\u201d<br><br>-So then post 580 Pine says Nacho is scum so he's taking everything he says with a bucket of salt, but he\u2019s making absolutely no attempt to refute Nacho or engage him in any way.<br><br>-Pine 604 with mafia theory about neighborizer being a bad fakeclaim. Completely avoiding posting any content. Very clearly just sitting back and seeing which mislynch goes through.<br><br>-bub\u2019s vote i get town vibes from, but TO\u2019s in 608 is scumtastic. also says \u201cPine I\u2019m not keen on\u201d which is the perfect thing to say about a scum buddy that you just voted but certainly never planned to try to get wagoned. (Keep in mind that she cleared Pine as town upon first replacing in and I don't recall her ever giving a solid reason for losing that. If in fact, she had found something Pine did scummy at some point she'd have mentioned it and she'd have acknowledged his soft accusation that she was waffling.)<br><br>-So then we have Pine's hammer, which is possibly the scummiest hammer I\u2019ve ever read. Says he\u2019s going to post a case for Voided as town and then hammers her for saying she\u2019d be willing to self vote to avoid a no lynch. It\u2019s priceless that he says \u201cI'm really, really torn now\u201d and gives her playstyle instructions if she flips town and then immediately hammers. <br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">TOWN</span><br>Cecily<br>HavingFitz<br>mikemike<br>pappums/Nacho<br>jerbs/bub<br>neil<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Scum</span><br>Xalxe/Pine<br>jinxx/TO<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Leaning scum - (maybe traitor?)</span><br>P.T.

Case in point: in the very same post that you accuse me of tunneling, you yourself admit to tunneling. Hypocracy much? Furthermore, you tell me to do real scum hunting in a post where you don't do any real scumhunting. This post doesn't ask any player tough questions, doesn't pressure any player, doesn't attempt to find scum in any way. All it is trying to do is to get two people of his back, a very scum mentality. You spend a whole massive paragraph attacking a player that you yourself say is town.<br><br>Neil, you say that I have no case on you, and yet a few posts ago you had this to say:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Neil wrote:</cite>I can see your actually trying, or appearing to be trying, So I give you credit for that. However, you have no case against me sir so I see no reason to warrant a response.

I asked you several times how my case was WIFOM, and you have yet to respond. I asked you in my last post what you thought of Pine and you have yet to respond. You see Neil, the thing with you is that you are constantly contradicting yourself and you only respond to people when they attack you. You are always defensive, and attack people who you think are town. That, my friend, is a scummy mindset. My vote is set."}

How is it old and irrelevant just because you addressed it? And how did I imply that you ignored it? I listed a LOT of posts I thought were scummy and rarely if ever mentioned anyone addressing them. What makes you so special? And nice little veiled accusation that I'm scum there. You really think I'm scum JUST because I didn't pay homage to you addressing that?<br><br>Here's the main reason I don't give your response to mike much weight. You said this yesterday:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>PT wrote:</cite>We should vote who we want to vote until we're under the pressure of a deadline (six days does not qualify) or there is a compelling reason to end the day (there isn't)</div></blockquote>. <br><br>And yet, in spite of making that statement you did exactly the opposite re: voided. If you really thought his claim was enough to lynch him then he'd have been who you wanted to be voting. You'd have fought for that wagon. Instead, you voted andrew and basically said \"I don't have any faith in this wagon, so when it gets closer to deadline I'll hop on the largest wagon.\" (Bolded below):<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>PT wrote:</cite>I like lynches on these two. I don't know which is more likely to get a wagon, so I'm going to go out on a limb and say andrew, just because Pine is still a fresh face. If there's interest in Pine I'll switch immediately.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: andrew</span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Come deadline time, if we continue to limit our choices to fitz and pappums, I'll vote pappums, as I've already said. But I hope that can be avoided.</span><br></div></blockquote><br><br>When you vote Nacho, the only reason you give is that you don't think fitz is scum so you better jump on the Nacho wagon! Here's the post:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>P.T. Barnum wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>voided wrote:</cite>Everyone else not voting Fitz/Nacho: Guys, there's three days left, and we'll no lynch if Fitz or Nacho aren't lynched. Unless you can whip up some amazing case to persuade the majority to someone else, WE NEED TO LYNCH ONE OF THEM TODAY IF AT ALL POSSIBLE!</div></blockquote><br>I agree with this, much as I don't like it.<br>I don't think havingfitz is scum.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Unvote<br>Vote Nacho</span></div></blockquote><br><br>At this point there were 3 days left and then there was even an extension. So what happened to the \"We should vote who we want to vote\"? Every one of your votes are terrible. You don't try to make a solid case, you don't pressure the person you're voting and you don't really try to get your suspect wagoned. And then it turns out that the whole time you really wanted Voided wagoned. And yet you never voted her when there was plenty of time to get a wagon going if you were so sure she was scum, or even brought up much against her in the first place to try to keep momentum on her original wagon.  Here's the post where you finally voted her (in spite of your supposed surety she was scum because of her claim):<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>P.T. Barnum wrote:</cite>If there's renewed interest in a voided wagon I'm totally up for that.  I particularly like his recent appeal to newbieness- that's a last resort if I've ever heard one.  The neighbor-neighborizor bit, as I've said and said, would be enough to lynch him.<br>Besides, the deadline's been extended.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Unvote <br>Vote: voided</span></div></blockquote><br><br>So I agree with Mike that if you thought voided was scum all along because of her claim, it makes no sense that you dropped her entirely the way you did. And your \"well, it didn't look like the wagon was going to happen\" looks pretty weak when she ended up lynched yesterday. Your hesitancy to actively push a wagon and really be the driving force between getting someone lynched looks terriscummy.<br><br>So here's the nutshell of your response that you want us to think should make the whole point against you go away: <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>PT wrote:</cite>There are a few people in this game with satisfactory reasons for a lynch. You seem to be saying that once someone commits a bad scumtell, every subsequent post and vote of mine should be devoted to lynching them. I don't think that's useful.<br>Wagons lead to reactions. Voided had his wagon, and I didn't think there was any interest for a future one. I tried to start one on andrew. Since we're so close to lynching, though, I figure lynching voided is far superior to lynching the other two.<br>And yes, I did forget about voided somewhat, but I guess I got bored with [her] and wanted to stir the pot.</div></blockquote><br><br>If you really thought she was scum and thought the claim was from certain scum, you wouldn't forget about her. Only scum forgets what their reads are supposed to be. And as for the \"every subsequent post should be devoted to lynching them\" somewhere in the middle would be nice. All you do is \"stir the pot\" with a <span style=\"font-style: italic\">very</span> small spoon, and it's the equivalent of laying low. I'm not saying you have to tunnel, but you should make SOME kind of effort to actually get your suspects wagoned instead of just hanging out and waiting for others to do the work (and therefore be targeted with the suspicion) and waiting to put your vote on the biggest wagon. This is what you did, and it's scummy."}

I did not want a \"voided wagon the whole time.\"  I wanted a Xalxe wagon, then I reread the game and wanted a Pine wagon (Xalxe's replacement) and an andrew wagon.   Voided was #3 or so on my scumlist (I don't keep one officially), and was so throughout the day.  I would have liked a lynch on him.  I would have especially liked a lynch on pine or andrew.  I would have easily taken voided over pappums, and I did.  The voided wagon was a surprise to me and everyone else.  <br>5. I wanted to be the driving force on several wagons that day.

Don't put words in my mouth.  I never said that I was sure voided was scum.  I said there was enough to lynch her (and several others).  Those are very different statements, especially on day one.

Even if voided had been scum, any information that he could have given up before his lynch would have been helpful, at least in determining who he didn't want to be lynched (ie. scum). The fact that Pine went against everything he said he was going to do initially and hammered before voided had his chance to speak is very anti-town. Any town player would have allowed voided to have a last word, especially because he was in fact town. And not wanting someone to self lynch is stupid, especially because we had a little while longer before the day would have been forced to end. If anything Pine could have waited another few hours for voided to get one last post in like he had requested, but no. Pine hammered. That is why I believe he is scum. <br><br>What I was trying to do last (real) night was read through and see who was avoiding confronting or questioning Pine and because I was very tired I may have missed a few things, but I started my previous post with the intention of calling out PT. After my read through I no longer had a strong case against him and so instead of not posting and waiting until I was more alert which probably would have been the better option I posted something unhelpful and rambling.

Day 1, I was so set on the Pappums lynch that I had really tunneled and not payed much attention to everyone else unless for some strange reason, I was brought up by them. I then went over the cases people presented against Voided and there were only two that stuck out to me. One I kind of dismissed, because I'm always cautious when it comes to the person hammering.

I believe you're town, and I know I am, so arguing with you won't do the town much good. If you still feel the need to lynch me, so that you can see you're wrong for yourself, feel free too. I believe once in awhile, everyone has to realize they're wrong at some point and if it takes my lynch to show you that, so be it. But the reason I'm defensive, is because you've now tunneled with your perception on me. You have no real suspicions, and I have looked over your ISO. Your cases aren't real. They are fabricated, stretched, perspectives that you've used my own words and changed them around or taken them out of context. I still have yet to see a single good point you've brought up that I have not acknowledged lately.

You are hyper sensitive and that IMO is suspicious.  And I do not think you've focused on me for \"a good part of the game\"....but then again I'm not sure who you are focusing on....other than the person who's wagon you pushed most of day one which for some reason you have abandoned in favor of your current gut vote.  <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>neil1113 - post 631 wrote:</cite>Pre-Edit: What is your case on me Fitz?

Yes, I've been quite active on the site and silent here. To be perfectly honest, I've put this off. Why? Because Setael's case is incredibly thorough, well-researched, and seemingly air-tight. For quite some time, I was thinking to not even bother, and just post my reads and let my flip clear both me and those reads. But like I said, I find that kind of attitude very anti-Town, bordering on playing against wincon. While doing an archive binge of one of my favorite webcomics, I came across the above strip, specifically the last panel.<br><br>I know, it's not exactly applicable. But with a little adjustment, it can easily be applied to Mafia. \"Scum don't have scumhunting cases. They have cleverly consistent fictions.\" The only way I feel someone could have arrive at such a seamless conclusion is with their objective pre-determined prior to making the case. A clever manipulator can twist almost any set of facts, especially a set that includes such a <span class=\"noboldsig\">glaring </span>error as my ill-advised hammer, into whatever kind of case they want. And to put it plainly, Setael's mind was made up far, far before he ever got to my first post.<br><br>If you look at his wall case against me, it is largely and strongly based in Xalxe's play, which I have already decried as amateurish and misleading. I've been worried since the start that someone would do a serious analysis of Xalxe's play and arrive at the conclusion I arrived at. When I replaced in, I decided to read the thread before looking at my role PM. I was fairly convinced at that time that Xalxe had pulled scum and that pappum's rat was our partner. I was <span class=\"noboldsig\">shocked </span>when I found <span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #00BF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Town Tracker</span></span></span> in my role PM.<br><br>I maintain that, while Setael may or may not be scum himself (and I'm trying not to be biased about him here), his entire (legitimate) case is based on Xalxe's truly bad play and my hammer of Voided. The rest of the case comes from that conclusion, after which all of my posts were irrelevant except as fodder for advancing his case.<br><br>Next post in a series of three: Why I hammered, and the case for Voided as Town that I never finished. The third will be answering the remaining questions and a final statement."}

I admit, Pine I do like your claim and there really is no way for someone to argue a tracker claim, but the truth of the situation is that somebody is lying. I'd be more inclined to believe such a claim if it were a more influential PR (such as doctor, cop, etc) and no one called you out for having the same role. I've been in a game where there were legitimately two trackers and while it confused us all, neither of them were lying and there was legitimately no way for anyone to argue it. With or without your claim, I believe setael's reads on you because they were so thorough and I honestly can't find a place to argue with them. <br><br>Whether or not it is fair, you came in after xalxe who did make a lot of mistakes and I'm still willing to vote for you because of those. But instead of hammering I'm all for allowing some time for you to make some final posts. You're welcome. <br><br>As for TO... Bold move, and bad move. If there are two NK's tonight, then we can be sure TO wasn't lying. But, in the case of a lazier/smarter scum team, they could easily not send in their PM as long as they're confident that who ever TO is lynching is town, and thus making it seem like TO is scum. I don't think TO claiming was a good idea, especially given the tendency for this group to label their next day targets so openly. <br><br>And fitz, if Pine is scum, he made some indication of there only being two scum in this game as setael pointed out, so how would that affect what you believe is the team?"}

He runs back up stairs and shuts the bathroom door behind him. He gets in the shower and turns on the water - smart move, stops the flames, but doesn't stop the smoke which is entering the room around the cracks in the door. He's got one option left - jumping from the second story window. The fall wouldn't be pleasant, but it wouldn't kill him.

Small point in Setael's favor.<br>Pine has two interesting posts in which he dismisses andrew completely without calling him scum.  In fact, Pine seems to refer to andrew as though he knew andrew was town.  Pine was a sloppy player, so I doubt he did this for effect.

I'm getting more and more wary of you. Been reading through the last few days and you seem to be posting just fluff, nothing questions, questionable votes and agreeing with people.<br><br>You voted PT ... seemingly purely because he attacked someone who attacked him (ie me). That's about as woolly a reason (see previous description of what woolly means people) as I've seen for voting for anyone. Which combined with 731 looks bad indeed.<br><br>Post 731 - you are more than happy to agree with Nacho's assessment that me, PT (who you later vote for little reason) and Fitz (why does everyone think he is town anyway ?) are confirmed town. And then happily add another couple to the confirmed list ... no one is confirmed at this point don't make out they are.<br><br>Post 727 - Little thing but you seem very sure how big the scum team is and its only the scum team who know that (and Rhino natch).<br><br>Post 725 you voted Chkflip for aggain what seems like a very simplistic reason (one post on Satael). You seem to be knee-jerk reacting to anyone that could be seen as even slightly scummy. Scum don't try and scum hunt they try and use what others post to their advantage.<br><br>Post 606 - you vote Voided because 'I agree with the case on him'. This is kind of like the demo of all of your scumsigns here - voting town (you vote Neil day 2), agreeing with people blindly, voting for no satisfactory reason (I mean come on - I agree with the case on him).<br><br>You have floated out a range of very basic questions of the nature of -who do you think is scum' (you have asked variants of this question a lot). This to me points at someone who is trying hard to look pro-town. Doesn't look like natural scum hunting at all to me. <br><br>And yes as PT kindly pointed out, Jerbs wasn't exactly un town like either. And with that ...<br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><br>Vote Bub</span><br><br>Before you ask ... I've not forgotton about you Fitz so I guess its a bit more tap dancing on that front. But we should lynch Bub today.</div></blockquote><br><br>The reason I'm voting for PT is that he has consistently only posted content targetted at people who have attacked him. Consistently. The first time he ever voiced any suspision of you was directly after you attacked him. For me, that capped of a trend and it reached a voting point.<br><br>As for me asking the \"who do you think is scum?\" question, that is the standard question that I ask of people who I think are not contributing to the game. Yes, I guess it is extremely generic, but that's sorta the point.<br><br>As far as me confirming scum, I agree, I did it too quickly.<br><br>In response to me knowing the size of the scumteam: I generally operate under the assumption of a three-scum team in mini games of 12-13 players.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Nachomamma8 wrote:</cite>Okay, so I've done a little bit of recalibrating, and mike really isn't confirmed town.

These are a couple of the ones I had noticed:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Cecily wrote:</cite>If it makes you feel any better about the question I was thinking of accompanying it with \"what three things would you bring if you were stranded on a desert island?\" just to keep the feel of ice breakers, but I didn't think that went along with the game very well and someone would probably have given me crap for asking it.</div></blockquote><br>This one because I don't see scum admitting that they thought of posting something and didn't in order to avoid negative attention.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Cecily wrote:</cite>Honestly, no one has jumped out as scummy yet. Everyone in this game seems for the most part level headed and no one has just been throwing claims around (other than pappums, but thats another story).</div></blockquote><br>Also this. I think townies are way more likely to admit to not having scum reads on anyone. Scum is careful to have <span style=\"font-style: italic\">some</span> suspects.<br><br>But actually, while ISOing her again I started doubting my read. She repeatedly says \"I'm going to be honest...\" which made me raise an eyebrow since scum would more likely be of the mindset that they have to convince us they're being honest. Also I don't like a few of the things she said re: the Pine wagon.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Cecily wrote:</cite>Alright, I'm not thoroughly convinced. I admit, Pine I do like your claim and there really is no way for someone to argue a tracker claim, but the truth of the situation is that somebody is lying. I'd be more inclined to believe such a claim if it were a more influential PR (such as doctor, cop, etc) and no one called you out for having the same role.<br></div></blockquote><br><blockquote><div><cite>Cecily wrote:</cite>Someone is lying because someone (or a few people) are always lying in this game. It seems very unlikely that both people who were attacked by seteal's post come out to be town oriented PRs and since I'm more willing to believe TO's claim because it can be proven via night actions I'm going to assume that Pine is lying about his role. <br></div></blockquote><br><blockquote><div><cite>Cecily wrote:</cite>I understand that we all want Pine lynched. I will be very happy if I get to hammer, but we do still have at least a week left in this day and I don't see what the whole mentality of voting asap just to make sure you were a part of the unanimous decision is all about.<br></div></blockquote><br><blockquote><div><cite>Cecily wrote:</cite>The only reason I wasn't on the Pine wagon was because I didn't log on in time to get my vote in before Pine lynched himself and I thought we were waiting at L-2 in order to keep the day going, but then fitz put us at L-1 and in came Pine before I could get my vote in. Otherwise I would have been all over it. </div></blockquote><br><br>She was way too eager to get town cred for Pine's lynch, and the whole someone is lying thing is weird. It's a stupid reason to be certain one of them is lying, and then the \"someone is always lying\" is just backtracking. I think she knew Pine was lying because she's his buddy.<br><br>Also, the fact that she keeps asking people to give reasons for suspecting her, which is something I've realized I do as scum.<br><br>Woo! 360! <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">unvote, vote: Cecily</span>"}

It just makes no sense for her to give the reason she did if she's town. It does make sense for her to see my magical flying dragon of a case and realize she has no choice but to bus and think she needs to drudge up a reason to be on the wagon. So it's not that town doesn't also want to come up with a reason, it's that scum's reasons are more likely to be really bad. Which hers was. Plus, she clearly wanted town cred with his lynch and she wouldn't get it by just sheeping my case, so she wanted to come up with her own reason to be on the Pine wagon. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Cecily wrote:</cite>I'm more willing to believe TO's claim because it can be proven via night actions I'm going to assume that Pine is lying about his role.</div></blockquote><br>This actually is also rubbish.

What do you mean when you say chk and I make a good pairing \"based solely off of who's being pushed?\"  Can you elaborate?<br><br>3) I've been pushing you for a few days.

Your reason for suspecting me is stupid.  It was meant to be humorous.  I realize past roles has nothing to do with respect to this game...but interjecting it as humor gave me another chance to bitch about the disparity.  I have <span class=\"noboldsig\">never</span> been scum in almost two years on this site, in 30+ games, except! for one game that I replaced in which was modded by Faraday...hence my comment to him.    <br><br><div align=\"center\"><hr style=\"height:14px; width:50%\"></div><br>Faraday...you don't know what you are doing.  Are you trying to relive our game where you were Riddick (ie suspecting me without any basis)?  You haven't provided any reasoning for suspecting me.  Saying you \"aren't big on explaining [your] reasoning\" is a cop out.  Everyone still alive in the game has provided ample material to at least be able to source/explain whatever suspicions you do happen to have.  What is your case on chkflp and on me?   <br><br><div align=\"center\"><hr style=\"height:14px; width:50%\"></div><br>Looking at the Day one lynch....four (Nachomamma8, P.T. Barnum aka Faraday, chkflip, Bub Bidderskins) of the seven players remain from the Void mislynch.  One of the dead has been ID's as scum...I find it hard to believe on a 7 player mislynch that there is not at least one other scum member (and I am assuming there are three scum).  As I do not think chkflp is scum...that leaves me with Nacho, Faraday and Bub.  I'm not confident enough to put a vote on any of them ATT though.  <br><br>Of the four remaing players alive off the Void mislynch I think there could be one scum (havingfitz, mikemike778, Idiotking aka Setael, Cecily).  Discounting myself of course...that leaves me with three.  I do not think Setael is scum based on his case on Pine (though it would have been a perfect time to bus a partner given Pine's poor play and scummy hammer) and between mikemike and Cecily...I suspect Cecily significantly more than I do mikemike (see earlier ISO sampling in this post).  I would also note that I had Pine <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2932775#p2932775\" class=\"postlink\">2nd on my suspect list</a> D1 before he hammered Void and voted him in my first post on D2.  I also voiced D1 suspicions on Pine in my <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2900671#p2900671\" class=\"postlink\">ISO 56</a> and <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2924139#p2924139\" class=\"postlink\">ISO 57</a>.<br><br>As for the D2 Pine wagon....I could see there being at least one partner bussing him which (not counting myself) leaves Faraday, mikemike, and Nacho.  As I am leaning against mikemike being scum ATM that gives me, once again, the toss up between Nacho and Faraday.  They are too close for me to choose between but if I had to I'd probably lean towards Faraday.  I definitely think there is at least one scum not bussing their partner Pine...which leaves us with Bub, Setael and, once again, Cecily.  I leaning town on Setael and between Bub and Cecily it's once again significant suspicions towards Cecily guiding my vote her way. <br><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">tl:dr;</span> I'm not convinced chkflp is scum so I will not change my vote from Cecily."}

Let's talk. I can think of a few reasons you didn't NK me last night. I know it wasn't to avoid it pointing to you, since I agree that I'd be a fairly logical NK after taking down Pine (in spite of the haters who said otherwise yesterday.) Rather, it's likely a combo of the following:<br><br>1) You think I'm a weak enough player that I won't be able to convince the town to lynch you, therefore rendering my NK unnecessary (sad face)<br>2) You know that your accent has an unexplainable power over me and you can use it to bend my will to yours<br>3) You know that I don't trust myself enough and could pretty easily be talked out of pursuing my scum reads<br>4) This game wouldn't be nearly as fun for you if I wasn't in it. (Who's digging for compliments now?)<br><br>PT was scum, so you're scum. I also think that if Cecily is really scum and you were really town, you'd have picked up on it yesterday (or at least supported my brilliant case on her) and Cecily would've been the lynch. A lot of the things you're saying don't sit right, like you clearing Bub just for one post Jerbs made and me for that matter when I could've been bussing, and being so sure you have the last 2 scums pegged. I also am suspicious of your claim. I don't think there'd be a 1-shot gunsmith in a game with a traitor, which I think is the scum setup. There's no way to disprove it, so it's a good scum claim and I agree with Cecily that PT would've used it already if he'd had it.<br><br>Isn't it a rule that there can only be one non-normal role in this type of mini? And aren't neighborizers and gunsmiths both non-normal roles? Please don't make me read the wiki.<br><br>I'm not sure what to think about Cecily. I still have a scum read on her, but if you're both scum that's some pretty hard core bussing you came out of the box with today. Same goes for her, though she really had no choice to vote you after those post of yours. (Great paintings btw!)<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Cecily wrote:</cite>And going along with the typical night action of scum killing someone completely irrelevant to scum also kind of clears fitz in my eyes.</div></blockquote><br>This is a weird reason to clear Fitz. What makes Nacho irrelevant to scum? Pretty much everyone had a strong town read on him, and the scum could've suspected he was a PR. And even if Nacho was \"irrelevant to scum\" how would that clear Fitz? And why only Fitz?<br><br>I still think Faraday and Cecily could both be scum. Faraday avoided commenting much on Cecily, and casually defended her when I attacked her. Possibly one of them is a traitor.<br><br>I think a massclaim might be good at this point, though it makes me nervous since Faraday suggested it."}

You knew you were up for a lynch if chk flipped town, so your motivation to fake claim is to avoid that happening. If enough townies believe your claim, it would likely save you. Especially where Cecily is one of your targets, she should be pretty easy to get lynched after yesterday's wagon.<br><br>Today's posts have drawn my attention to Bub, since both Faraday and Cecily cleared him with really weak reasoning. An ISO of Bub is pretty damning, actually. He's posted relatively little and helped lynch Voided without getting his hands dirty. All he said was he agreed with the case and preferred it to the other wagons. He maintained that Neil was his strongest scum read when he voted Voided and again after my Pine case. That post is suspicious (ISO 20) since he doesn't really comment on the Pine case, just says \"I agree that Pine is scummy as well\" and FOSes him. He then asks Neil what Neil thinks of the Pine case, even though Bub didn't comment on it.<br><br>He doesn't comment on Pine again until after the tracker claim and then these 2 posts:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Bub wrote:</cite>Hmmm, Pine's post seems wordy and desperate. He knows he's in a corner and is trying to find a way out of it with a cleverly disguised OMGUS. <br><br>Pine, who did you track last night?<br><br>*********<br><br>Mikemike seems like a terrible tracker choice. I've never played as a tracker before, but I assume that you would want to target somebody who you thought was scum to try and get them targetting the night kill. Right?<br><br>Pine: Why mikemike and not a scum suspect?</div></blockquote><br><br>Since he managed to avoid saying much about Pine before these posts, it seems likely he felt he had no choice but to bus. Even then, he still doesn't push Pine at all or add to his case or ever vote him. These posts were probably just to distance.<br><br>His first post after pine's flip is highly suspicious now that chk flipped town. He votes chk using the reason I had provided the day before, which was weak in the first place. If he were town I think he could've come up with his own reason, and a better one.<br><br>So then there's this post:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Bub Bidderskins wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Nachomamma8 wrote:</cite><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: Cecily</span><br><br>She waffled on the Pine wagon yesterday A LOT, which suggests that she was unsure of which position to take on her scumbuddy's wagon. We go from Pine is an inevitable lynch and will die anyways <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2952431#p2952431\" class=\"postlink\">here</a>, to attacking havingfitz for rushing the wagon <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2959413#p2959413\" class=\"postlink\">here</a>. I find this a bit more damning that chkflip's play because he at least was consistent.<br><br>PT Barnum, havingfitz, and mike are pretty much confirmed town at this point.</div></blockquote><br><br>I agree, except I would at Satael to the list of town. He basically orchestrated the Pine lynch. That leaves:<br><br>Nacho<br>Chk<br>Cecily<br>Myself<br><br>I know I'm town, and I've got a town read on Nacho (pine's constant attacks on Pappums vouch for him). So that leaves Chk and Cecily as the remaining scum simply by the process of elimination, without even getting into the cases on those two.</div></blockquote><br><br>This is suspect because he sheeps Nacho in clearing PT Barnum, havingfitz, and mike for pretty much nonexistent reasoning. (He later says he cleared PT because he was the first vote on the Pine wagon, but then when it's pointed out he was actually 3rd he just says \"oops, yeah.\") I'd like to know what he thinks of the list he gave here now that Cecily and himself are the only ones left in his list of possible scum. If Bub is scum, based on this post I'd say his buddy is Faraday, fitz or mike.<br><br>His next several posts are asking simple questions without any analysis at all and then he attacks PT, but as soon as Faraday replaces in he drops all suspicion of PT.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">mod: Did Bub pick up his 'day has started' prod?<br></span>"}

It can be a scum role so it doesn't confirm anyone to us. Even if there are only 2 scum to make up for the lack of town power, it still doesn't seem very balanced. Frankly, even with a 1-shot gunsmith and 2 1-shot Neighborizers, there could be just 2 scum since this is the weakest town setup I've ever played.

This means the set-up is 1-shot gunsmith/1-shot vig/1-shot neighbourisers vs goon and 1(?) shot neighbouriser. POSSIBLE. I think it's the only realistic way to balance a 2 scum group set-up but on the other hand something like 1-shot rb'er, or 1-shot rolecop would make much more sense? And even then, eh. 1-shot vig in a 2 player scumgroup game is harsh. 13 players. town get 5 possible mislynches? Meh. Seems unlikely.<br><br><span style=\"color: #00BF40\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">b)I'm scum</span></span>: </span></span>Yeah I know this isn't true, but you guys do not. 1shot vig + 2x1shot neighbourisers versus scum goon and scum ???. Not impossible, but once again a lot of the same problems apply as above. 1-shot vig and a 2 man scumteam just doesn't work for me. Oh 4 mislynches if the vig vig's wrong, but if he hits scum then like scum need 6? That's yeah, I don't think that's likely.<br><br><span style=\"color: #008000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">c) me and mike are both town, a vt is scum</span></span></span> Yeah, no. if the above isn't likely this is even more unlikely, although I guess not theoretically impossible it's just bad on scum. So nope, ruling it out.</fieldset><br><br>Okay, see I don't think either of those are very likely <span style=\"font-style: italic\">at all</span>. The blue one is the most likely out of these from my pov, but even at that I think it's a stretch. Not 3 scum, not 2 scum. Traitor fits this set-up perfectly in terms of power.<br><br>So if we're dealing with 2+traitor it throws the cat amongst the pigeons. We can fairly much assume mikemike's not the traitor, as he'd know the mafia and be able to neighbourise one of them. Ooh, actually mike's neighbouriser thing could be a recruitment abillity for bub traitor [/tinfoilhat] but bub is town I think <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\"><br><br>Sorry anyway.<br><br><fieldset style=\"border:3px outset grey; padding:5px 10px\"><span style=\"color: #BF40BF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"> Option 3: 2scum + traitor<br>A) I'm lying. </span></span>The set-up is 1shot vig +2x1-shot neighbourisers vs 2 scum + traitor. Obviously you have to assume I claim gunsmith here as a gambit in this case, if I'm traitor havingfitz is who I'd clear I guess? I mean, I dunno I think the town are fairly weak here if scum have any sort of pr, and even without it. plus there's the fact I as scum would have no idea if there was a hidden investigative role and would be risking myself to a watcher/tracker/cop/gunsmith god knows what counterclaim. This probably works best for me traitor as IIRC if the 2 group scum are lynched the traitor can't win UNLESS he can be recruited, which I guess is possible. Eh.<br><br><span style=\"color: #FF4000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">B) Mikemike is a scumneighbouriser. </span></span>This is possible, definitely possible. 2 1-shot neighbourisers on each side is pretty cool, actual has nice parity. vig/gunsmith is probably enough to balance the role. His reason for not reacting to voided's claim is okay, actually. But I'd question why he didn't push to defend him more if that was the case. Mikemike you say you thought the claim made him more likely to be town? Can you show us in your iso where you defended him, I don't really remember you doing that. Thanks.<br><br><span style=\"color: #4000BF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">C) We're both lying (lol).</span></span> Uh, anyone actually think there's 2 scum + traitor vs 1x1-shot vig and 1x-shot neighbouriser vs mafia neighbouriser? And that'd mean I'd be a traitor or something and locked myself into a fucking 50% chance of lynching my only chance of winning. This is impossible fmpov, but pretty much impossible from yours too. Actually literally impossible, bub confirmed him as having it, so that'd require all 3 of us to be scum.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><span style=\"color: #BF40BF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">D) We're both telling the truth</span></span></span></span>. 2x1-shot neighbourisers, my role + 1shot vig. Scum have traitor + goon +??? (maybe a rb'er?). I could see this too, except I think mikemike's responses have been scummyish. I don't know though, he's not scumlying about his roleclaim unless he's scum with bub. Sigh. This makes the most sense from a set-up point of view I think, but I'm having a hard time buying bub scum.

I am willing to shoot whoever the town thinks is the most scummy besides Pine by a democratic choice in night 2.<br>If you want me to count you as voting for someone to be shot tonight, put NightVote:playername in the last line of any post in normal text (unvotes likewise).<br>The decision will be made if any player has a)more than 50% of the votes, or b) significantly more votes than their nearest contender.<br><br>Given a Pine lynch seems pretty much a sure thing following his voided hammer and subsequent abandonment of the thread, this should give us a reason to extend the day as long as possible.</div></blockquote><br><br>Well the problem with that is that scum may be able to intefere with your kill, not a good idea to discuss who you are planning to target (if you aren't telling fibs that is). Us naming names isn't the way to go ... use the info available to make your own mind up. This doesn't clear TO completely as scum could themselves have an extra kill one night but TO seems pretty risk averse to me - the way the game's gone so far, I don't see her fake claiming this.<br><br>Pine is obviously going to be the lynch for today ... was probably still trying to fabricate his story when he was rushed into revealing it before he was ready (he hadn't got to the bit about who he was going to track yet it seems).<br><br>Nontheless plenty of time no rush, we can wait a bit for his second and third posts before rushing anything.</div></blockquote><br><br>And that was it for the day.

The current excitement re: him appears to be based on his non-reaction to Pine's claim.

Though I think neighbors/neighborizors are a pretty much worthless role.   So on the one hand...Pine appeared doomed whether mikemike said anything or not, on the other hand, even if mikemike had called him on it...not sure there would have been any repercussions towards mike.

Faraday had a chance to hammer Bub and now mikemike had the chance to hammer Cecily.  Based on the assumption I am working with that there are two scum still alive...I do not think it would be unreasonable to have one scum bus the other.  That said...if Bub was town, and I am town (based on I know I am and based on Faraday's investigation result)...that would mean two of Faraday, mikemike, Cecily and Setael are scum.  Setael is being viewed as town because of her push on Pine...Faraday is being viewed as town for his unopposed claim and how it fits in the game plus his accurate investigation result.  This would leave Cecily and mikemike as scum.  But mikemike was on the Bub wagon when it was at L-1 and I noticed Cecily online ATT as well....which was why I unvoted suddenly.  If Bub was town and Cecily is scum as many suspect...I think she had a short window to hammer Bub for the win (assuming 2 scum left). <br><br>I'm rambling a bit...it's late and I need to sleep.  <br><br>So mikemike has a chance to hammer Cecily but is waiting for some reason.  What was the reason again?  <br><br>Also...why do people keep bringing up a traitor?  I've never even played in a game that had one before so I find it amusing it keep being brought up.  If there is a traitor...does that person even know s/he is a traitor?  Is a traitor town until recruited/shanghai'd by scum?  If so...wouldn't the traitor have been selected before this point in the game?  I'm not sure what good it does to bring up the possibility of there being a traitor of only one scum left.  I hope there is one scum left and that it is Cecily.  And if there is a traitor (which I hate even hypothesizing about because I don't think there is), if they arean't scum yet then everyone who has a town aura about them is still open to suspicion.  Which only helps scum as it braodens the pool of reasonable/likely suspects.  And for those who think it may be me....if I don't know I'm one...and Faraday used his inv on me last night....then I still haven't been recruited into the scum group.  So I'm not sure why that option is being tossed around.  Still rambling.  Zzzzzzz<br><br>P-edit...looks like Faraday did some pre-hammer thinking too."}

Guess you didn't think I was scummy then did you despite knowing the above?<br><br>You've managed to skirt around the entire game being as inconspicious as possible, sheeping where possible and generally doing your best to seem as uncontraversial as possible To be honest, you'd have been better off sticking to that game plan, if this is the best you can come up with in terms of putting together a fake case.<br><br>You are the confirmed scum I'm afraid. Cec may or may not be your buddy (if you have one) but you need to be lynched today.</div></blockquote><br><br>Counter claiming would make it evident that Voided was lying. It is quite rare for there to be two neighborizers in the same game. Your hesitance to do so reads as scummy to me.<br><br>Also, the timing of when I brought these arguments up is irrelavent to their legitimacy.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>havingfitz wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Bub Bidderskins wrote:</cite>If you were town, then that would not have been your thought process. Catching scum would be well worth giving up such trivial information as the fact that you are a neighborizer. The counter-claim would have made it evident that Voided was lying and he would have been lynched for sure. However, you knew that Voided would flip town and so you didn't want to counter-claim because then you would come under fire for it the next day.<br><br>The scumteam is Cec/MikeMike, but Mike is confirmed scum at this point.</div></blockquote><br>Why would mikemike assume he was catching Void in a lie? If mikemike was/is town...he wouldn't be sure of Void's alignment and he would probably feel the claim (not the alignment) was legitimate. If he had counter claimed as you mention Void probably would have been more assured of being lynched than he already was. I'm not saying mikemike is town but your continued push on him seems very contrived and based on a lot of imagination.<br><br>Also,<br><blockquote><div><cite>havingfitz wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Bub Bidderskins wrote:</cite>As far as him not getting a tracker result when you targetted him, I doubt that's true.</div></blockquote><br>Bub...what are you talking about here? What result are you talking about from when who targetted who? You aren't referring to Pine's fake tracker claim and the result he said he got on mikemike are you?<br><br>And how does mikemike's actions around the time Void claimed make him scummy? You say he should have immediately counter claimed. How many times have any of us ever seen a 1-shot Neighborizor in a game? If I had got that role PM I would have been like...whuh? And to have that role and see another player claim the exact same role had to make a player really wonder what was going on. I would have taken the claim as truthful (whether I was a scum or town neighborizor). How would mikemike KNOW that Void was town? Based on Void's claim or based on the fact you think he [mikemike] is scum? When you were neighborized by mikemike did any of the QT conversation revolve around the fact that there we two 1-shot neighborizors in the game? <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Bub Bidderskins wrote:</cite>...you knew that Voided was town. You knew that if you counter-claimed, and voided was lynched, then the suspision would fall onto you. A townie would instantly jump onto somebody who claimed their exact same role, but you backed off and distanced yourself from that very wagon.</div></blockquote><br>I'm not sure mikemike ever backed off Void...I don't recall him ever being ON Void to begin with. What would mikemike coming out and claiming 1-shot neighborizor in response to Void's claim have accomplished? It would have either sealed Void's fate (which wasn't necessary) or just confused people's views towards mikemike (whether he was town or scum). If I was scum and had a 1-shot neighborizor role I'm not sure if I would have ever even botherd to use it after Void's claim. I think I would have avoided using it and if the need to claim came up later in the game...either claim VT or some other PR fakeclaim that did not mirror Voids's.<br><br>tl:dr; I'm not sure mikemike's actions are as unreasonable as you have portrayed them to be Bub.<br><br>Who are your #2 and #3 suspects Bub?</div></blockquote></div></blockquote><br><br>Sorry I didn't comment on this earlier when I was on, but I didn't have the time at that point to make a good, well thought out post do to RL concerns.<br><br>Your defense of MikeMike is noted, but I don't see why a townsperson would not counter-claim at that point, and none of the discussion in the QT revolved around that fact at all.

That is simply anti-town and exactly what scum would think. And the question isn't about what would have occured if he had counter-claimed, the question is: why didn't he?

Is the above on accurate representation of what you were thinking (or claim you were thinking) last night ? I've never claimed it represented anything else.

She must be the one preparing to kick you all out and build that shopping center.<br><br>By the evening when cecily returned, it was too late for her to change your minds. Since you had so long to think about it, you decided to do this the old fashioned way - the noose was already tied and hanging from the tree in cecily's front yard. She didn't put up much of a fight as the noose was placed around her neck. when the chair was kicked away, her neck didn't snap as intended. Instead, she hung there silently suffocating.

Inside the house, mike heard the door open as he was lying in bed. He heard the footsteps coming up the stairs. He saw the figure enter his room, with a gun in his hand. Terrified, mike trembled out a few words: \"Are... are.. you gonna kill me?\" The gun started to raise. Mike closed his eyes, knowing it was the end. Nothing happened. He opened his eyes and realized the figure was simply switching on the light. It took a few seconds for mike's eyes to come into focus.

My intention was, the traitor would use the neighborizer ability to try to neighborize a goon. The 1-shot for both neighborizers only counted as a shot if they successfully created a neighbor. The neighborizer action happens last after night kills, so if a player the neighborizer targeted was killed, the neighborizer attempt would fail and thus not count as a shot. However, the 1-shot vig mechanic was such that it counted as a shot if you pm'ed me a target - if it failed, the shot was gone. Thats why I didn't want to answer the 1-shot mechanic questions. But hey, I'm a new mod, I can learn things too.

I disagree.  You are speaking from the perspective of knowing it was a gambit while D1 unfolded.  Town wasn't so fortunate.  It completely derailed any legitimate scumhunting that I, Void, or pappums could have done if it hadn't occured.  And knows how Setael and Faraday would have viewed it if they experienced it.  Though I suspect Faraday would be of the same opinion since he would have known it was a gambit just like you did.  The D1 activities only confirm my opinion that town should not lie.

I mean, his arguments were good, but I objected to his read because I knew I was town.

Sucks that she was town in the end.<br><br>Always held Fitz as town.<br><br>IK was null, but I didn't like his play at all.<br><br>Jahudo was null, though I didn't like 141 because of the 3rd line about it. I suppose I could argue he was getting town after awhile.<br><br>Jinxx/Bub and Jerbs/Tars: Both were leaning scummy, and I think I actually said Tars was scum.<br><br>Mikemike:...REALLY not sure. I'd be safe saying he was null, but trying to think what I was thinking a couple months ago now, I'm not entirely sure.<br><br>Neil: I felt he was town, honestly. Wasn't liking his play at the end, which made him more scummy/null, but he was still town at my lynch.<br><br>P.T.: WAHHHH WHY WEREN'T YOU TOWN?! I HAD YOU PEGGED AS TOWN WHEN I WAS LYNCHED! WHYYYYYYY??!<br><br>Rat: obviously I thought he was scum, and didn't think Nacho alleviated it.<br><br>Xalxe/you: Xal was town to me, you were null."}

After PR came clean, it was you who made the big deal about PR lying, rather than looking around at other players' reactions and thinking hmmm, if this really was a gambit, how would town and scum react to voided being called guilty if he a) really was, or b) wasn't, and seeing who fit the profiles. I understand PR did lie, but in the heat of the moment I was feeling like town wasn't really taking advantage of the gambit there. <br><br>Actually, were I in PR's position there, I'd have considered not coming clean at all and just following through with lynching voided since his reaction to being called guilty was so bad.</div></blockquote><br><br>Thanks for these comments guys. I never thought my gambit would blow up in my face so violently like that, and I was not prepared to deal with the fallout from it. I almost quit mafia because of this game, but I am glad I stuck it out and remained here. I have become a much more conservative scummer because of the reactions in this game."}
