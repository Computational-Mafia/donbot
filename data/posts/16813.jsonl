Depending on the circumstance, you may be able to paraphrase things I have sent you (such as a role PM). Use common sense and if you are unsure feel free to ask me via PM. <br>\n4) Be courteous to your fellow player. This is just a game - please don't bring personal grudges into the game. Try and keep it civil. If you cross 'the line' I'll step in. Said line will be judged by me.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">&gt; Voting, Lynching &amp; Death </div><br>\n5) For your vote to be counted, it must be bold, and in the form <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: Hoopla</div>. Caps and colons are optional, but it does need to be bolded. The vote tags are also appropriate for voting.<br>\n5a) Broken bold tags won't count. Mispellings or shortened names are ok as long as it is clear who you are voting. If I can't tell who you're voting, it won't count. <br>\n6) Unvotes aren't necessary before placing a new vote. Unvotes are necessary if you want to completely remove your vote. Please bold your unvotes or use the unvote tags. It is not necessary to name the player you are unvoting. <br>\n7) A lynch will occur when a player achieves 50% +1 of the votes - a majority. When this has happened, any subsequent votes and unvotes will not be counted, and the game will enter twilight. Night will begin as soon as I have declared the lynch. <br>\n8) You may vote for a no lynch if desired. If at least 50% of the players in the game vote for a no lynch, the game will progress to night without a lynch. <br>\n9) Once you're dead, you are dead. Do not post in the thread until the game is over, not even a 'bah' post. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">&gt; Activity &amp; Deadlines </div><br>\n10) Treat this game as a commitment, and try your best to stay active. <br>\n11) Prods will be issued after 72 hours in a row without posting. If I keep having to prod you I'll get angry and replace you. Players may request a prod on another player too. I'm human and I may forget so if you want someone prodded just tell me. <br>\n11a) If you do not open a prod within 24 hours of it being sent I will begin looking for a replacement. <br>\n12) Things come up in life, if you need time off for something, please let myself and the players know in-thread for V/LA purposes. I will be flexible, but if you can't be here for a significant amount of time I will replace you. <br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">13) Deadlines for each game day will be 2 weeks, except day 1 which will have a 3 week deadline. </div><br>\n14) In the event of a deadline ending without a player gaining a majority of votes, there will no lynch. No pluralities for lynching. <br>\n15) Nights will have a <div style=\"display:inline-flex;text-decoration:line-through\">48</div> 72 hour deadline. If you fail to send in a night choice, I will automatically default to 'no choice' for that night, and you will do nothing. The night scene may not exactly be up after <div style=\"display:inline-flex;text-decoration:line-through\">48</div> 72 hours, but give or take an hour or 10 and it will be. <br>\n16) Deadlines will only be extended if I need a number of replacements, or barring some other freak circumstances. Apart from that, laziness, or anything else, will not result in a deadline extension. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">&gt; Other Information </div><br>\n17) <div style=\"display:inline;color:#008000\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">These are my colours and font I will use for modly purposes. All other colors are fair game as long as they are easily read by your other players/myself, just don't post a rainbow.</div></div><br>\n18) I will try to post Vote Counts as often as possible. Hopefully on the top of every page. If you feel a vote count is needed, don't hesitate to ask for one, and I'll provide one at the next opportunity. <br>\n19) It's more than possible I've missed a rule or haven't completely covered something. Don't be a prick and try to exploit it, or I will end your existence. Yes that means modkill.<br>\n20) I reserve the right to add more, or modify existing rules at any time. If this happens, I will let everyone know. <br>\n21) <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#800000\">Flavour in night/day write up's is just that; flavour.</div></div> <br>\n22) No cryptography.<br>\n23) Have fun!</div></div></div>", "time": "Mon Mar 07, 2011 2:28 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=16813&start=0", "forum": "53", "thread": "16813"}

I can't think of a town benefit either, though its one of those icebreaker questions I see often. And now that I think about it scum would be more likely to lie, so it could benefit them if they want to plan out lurking times or setup quickhammers in the future.

Ex....we all mistakenly focus on a townie and \"pressure\" him.  Then we lynch Void...and scum NK's one of the pressured townies main opponents.  That sets up the townies mislynch tomorrow.  I'm sure scum could equally come up with a beneficial way of selecting their nk as well if the pressure was appropriately placed (ie on scum).

Later, he asked me if I have ever been scum before, which also heavily implies that he thinks I am scum. Claiming a one-shot day cop A.) Gets others to go with him on me being scum without everyone second-guessing what his motives could be, b.) potentially quicklynches me (I know he didn't want that, but it was still a possibility, like if Jerbs came back and vote for me while I was still at L-1), and c.) Keeps him safe from a cop counter because being a one-shot claim means he's just a regular townie after the usage. Arguably the only flaw in the plan is if I'm actually town or town-aligned, which puts him on the block tomorrow (and I don't need to be scum to point out that NKing him would be stupid since he'd be lynched tomorrow barring some other case gets thrown up before he's hammered.

That's not far off what the probable ratio of scum to town is for the entire game.  <br>\n<br>\nAnd if we assume there was one scum off the wagon (and I would argue possibly two off the wagon if Void IS scum)....then you have to look at 1-2 of Voided, Jahudo, andrew, Neil, Jerbs (assuming he is still in the game), mikemike (is he still playing) and Idiotking.  <br>\n<br>\nSo basically you're saying in your theory...there is probably scum on and off Void's wagon.  <br>\n<br>\nI would argue there is no guarantee there were any scum on Void's wagon given they had a claimed result on him (from possibly a townie) which was going to offer the opportunity for scum to lay back and let town do the lynch (whther it was on scum or town) without them having to join in (see neil).  See how that <div style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: normal; display: inline\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">LIE</div> </div>was a bad thing?  So yeah, good stuff.

Everything that has occurred since the <div style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: normal; display: inline\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">LIE</div></div> will be of use D2 and beyond but it did us no good today.  Which is my point.  I stopped looking at anyone else (as I would assume some others did) because I believed pappum's <div style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: normal; display: inline\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">LIE</div></div> and figured we had confirmed scum.  Now we will have to get flips on pappums and possibly Void to see how everyone's actions may have been motivated.

The fact he asked for no quicklynch means nothing to me as I did not share his opinion on the matter.  IMO a confirmed scum so early on D1 was better off eliminated asap.  I&#8217;ve given my reason in further detail and if people don&#8217;t agree with them they are entitled to their opinions.  <br>\n<br>\nAs for immediately jumping on pappum&#8230;I did this for a few reasons&#8230;1) My vote on Void was no longer for valid reason so I needed to unvote him.  2) My vote before I went to Voided was on pappums to begin with so without #3 it still would have probably gone back to him (pappums, and 3) pappums lied and wasted towns&#8217; time.  Yes&#8230;the days events will still be of value later on but our time would have been better served IMO looking for scum and not having our play revolve around Void guilt (which true as it might be&#8230;is deemed confirmed until the lie was confessed).  And I support the LAL policy.  <br>\n<br>\nAs for me rolefishing...wth are you talking about?  I didn't ask pappum or Void to claim.  pappum has said his result on Void was a lie but I do not recall whether or not he hass said his claimed role is a lie.  To ask if that was a lie is not rolefishing.  If that really is his role then IMO that would confirm that either pappum or Void is scum as I do not believe there would be a one shot day cop AND a neighborizor in a mini normal.

Scum would never do that.  Or would they.  Pappums may or may not be scum but what he is&#8230;in this instance at least&#8230;is a confirmed liar.  That is enough in my book to lynch.

However I don't agree with the L.A.L style of Mafia, so I can't justify lynching him just because he lied, despite how anti-town that is. I kind of understand his view, as far as trying his luck at reaction fishing. However there are better ways then this, and he could've single handedly caused a stupid lynch on perhaps a town PR, and then we'd be **** out of luck at the start of Day 2, especially if scum hit ANOTHER town PR during the night. So I WOULD be up for lynching him for the single purpose that he almost caused a lynch on someone that may or may not be scum, all because he was \"reaction fishing.\"</div></blockquote>\n\nSo you don&#8217;t agree with LAL in mafia&#8230;but you state in your ISO 11 that you don&#8217;t like his lying.  Then in the quote directly above, you don&#8217;t want to lynch him for lying&#8230;but you DO want to lynch him on the basis of what COULD have happened because of his lying.  Wha?  That makes no sense to me.  So not the act itself but the potential outcome of the act.  Sounds like you want to steer clear of perceived policy lynching but you still like being on the liar&#8217;s wagon.  </div></blockquote>\n\n... what? Why did you confuse what I said? I said it in a way that nobody else seemed to get confused, so why did you? If it helps, I'll say it AGAIN this time in a way that even you can understand it:<br>\n<br>\nI don't like that he lied. But I don't lynch all liars, because it's a lynch wasted usually. Townies lie because they are human. Humans lie. *gasp* yes Fritz I know... it's a hard concept to grasp. But follow me here.<br>\n<br>\nSo we've established already the fact that he lied in order to get a reaction. Now that this part is out of the picture, my difficulty with it is the fact that his lie could have gotten a townie lynched. Lying in and of itself isn't always anti-town as someone pointed out. Reaction fishing, isn't usually anti-town. HOWEVER... when you let it get to a point of a possible mislynch BECAUSE of your lie, then it becomes Anti-Town. Following?<br>\n<br>\nSo I don't want to lynch Pappums because he lied, but because of the implications the lie was very close to having. Get it? I hope so, because I am NOT repeating myself again. The fact that you've completely twisted this in your explanation of \"what I said\", helps my read of you as scummy. Why would scum purposely put a very simple concept, and twist it to make it difficult to understand? If I had said what you said I said, even I'd be confused by that concept.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>havingfitz wrote:</cite>This is not the first time you have done a 180 in the same post.

If you don't understand this, I really have doubts about you being above the age of 13. I kept my vote off of him, like I've explained, because I was certain if pappum's claim was real, that Voided would be lynched without much of a doubt. We had a LONG time before the day came to an end, why would I want to rush a lynch? When the time came, he'd be lynched. I was certain of it. Why rush things? You rushing the day, is anti-town.

I could've said \"arrogant jerk\" or \"ignorant jerk\" or \"blind-sided jerk\" and all would be acceptable.

I'm saying it so that you could be careful in which you speak.<br>\n<br>\n \"thick skull?\" Again, referring to a more one sided, tunneling outlook. Instead of being open and realizing, there's almost nobody here that's actually following you, you instead attempt to get questions out there by referring to the term \"we\" and \"us.\" As far as I've been concerned, there are people agreeing with my reads and if they are town, they are on my side. Now I apologize if anything I said was taken as a personal attack on you as a person outside of this game. I didn't mean for anything to come off that way, though I can easily see how my words could've been taken that way.

My point was in disproving your statements, and proving that you are a hypocrite when it comes to your own \"policy.\" You lied, and I've explained it in my previous posts against you. I laid my cards out on the table that I had against you, in order that I may move on from you. Like I said, I don't believe you to be scum, just slightly anti-town. However, if you could take half the effort you put into me, and put it into scum hunting, I do believe you can be a great asset to the town when you choose to be. So my goal in the posts I made, were to make you come out and \"choose to be.\"<br>\n<br>\nLastly, about this whole \"fencesitting idea.\" You did not agree with Andrew did you? Please don't let it be so. Andrew's case is that because I basically called him out on a policy lynch, if nothing else, I'm scummy. He has no fencesitting case against me, because I am very careful where I put my vote. I acknowledged where I'd be putting my vote when the day came to, but I didn't want the day to end quickly so I kept the vote to myself during that moment. I WASN'T okay with a quick lynch. That's not fence sitting, that's technique. And now? How do you see right now as fence sitting? I'm still waiting for Pappums to come back before I move on. My vote is on him. My vote has spoken. You can't be fence sitting, when you're voting for someone. Voting is more powerful then the actual words themselves when it comes down to it. Fence sitting? Really?

His post prior to mine mentioned he thought you were fencesitting and that is how I see some of the 180&#8217;s you have done. In your ISO 10 you  agree with theory regarding lynching Voided (which was to do it ASAP) and then say you want to extend the day 17 more (rl) days.  You dislike that pappums lied and are voting him for the impact his lie could have had but you indict the LAL policy.  You do not find me scummy and then proceed to lay out a case on me as to why I am scummy.  It seems like you want to have things both ways.  If fencesitting doesn&#8217;t sit well with you, consider my accusation to be for contradictory comments instead.<br>\n<br>\nI&#8217;m not certain pappums is scum (nor anyone else) but his lie is the model lie for my support to the LAL in this instance.  Someone pointed out that not all lies are bad for town.  I can agree with that comment and I could envision some instances where a lie would not warrant a LAL sentiment.  That does not apply to pappums&#8217; lie however.  His lie could have resulted in a mislynch and hypothetically&#8230;if there was a cop of some sort in the game&#8230;the lie could have forced a PR to out itself.  Then there could have been two roles  outted due to his lie (along with Voided&#8217;s Neighborizor claim).  That is a lie worthy of a LAL IMO.  And despite your aversion to LAL&#8230;in this instance your vote on pappums is a result of him lying.

If Pappums had done this as anything other than a gambit, it would have been mindblowingly stupid, because the question \"why did he do it so early and on a gut read?\" would have always been present.  The only other possibility that I can see (beyond it being the gambit he claims it to be) is an attempt to look town by doing something that would be incredibly stupid if done as scum.

If you almost got VM lynched and your role is town, you're not playing to your win condition so you deserve to be lynched for being anti-town.

I understand that you explained why you chose those words, and while I completely understand the contexts, they were unnecessary.

The only real risky vote for scum in this case is the hammer itself, which is another reason why they'd want to vote earlier and hope there's someone with a personality for quick-hammering as either alignment.<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\nI looked through the voided voters to see who comparatively looks scummier.

IMO there would be no way someone would falseclaim a result on another player when there was a way of proving that result.  If VM were to have been lynched and turned out town...it would have been obvious (to me at least) that pappums was scum (or at the very least town not playing to the town's wincon).

You made a bold claim with your result on Void which I was inclined to believe, you admit you lied to us, then you come after me.  WTH wouldn't I think you were scum.  Then the best you can do is throw insults at people.  <br>\n<br>\nAll this despite your willingness to lynch Void on the same basis that most people generally base D1 suspicions on (hunches I would argue), your defense of  him, and STILL maintaining the confidence in your hunch on him to re-vote him. (at least until you swapped to me)   <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol2.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"Laughing\">   The only time there are better reasons to suspect someone D1 than a hunch would be in the case of a ..............wait for it.....................confirmed investigation result or a really bad and/or exposed lie.  ding! ding! ding!<br>\n<br>\nAlso...while you had expressed suspicions of me in relation to your lie, your vote on me comes across as nothing more than OMGUS given your confidence in Void's guilt and the only issues you raise when you vote me regard policy lynches (which you yourself admit you support).

You call your lie a gambit.  I call your lie scummy.  And whether you consider your lie a contradiction or not (aren't lies typically a contradiction of the truth once they are uncovered)....the basis of LAL= a lie.  I'm not pushing your lynch for contradicting yourself...I'm pushing your lynch because of your lie...and subsequent play.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">tl:dr;</div> pappums suspects Void enough to lie about him, considers letting the lie run its course to a Void lynch, defends Voids actions and then immediately re-votes him.   Then he ad-hom's me and places an OMGUS vote on me for my policy lynch comments.<br>\n<br>\nBTW...I always get a kick out of people who want to lynch other players who advocate policy lynches...it's like a policy lynch loicy lynch.  It's inherently hypocritical.  <br>\n<br>\nSo what are your reasons again pappums for voting me?", "time": "Sat Mar 19, 2011 12:23 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=16813&start=250", "forum": "53", "thread": "16813"}

As three others did as displayed by their actions if not their comments.  With the entire basis for my opinion being pappums' honesty...the fact he lied distorts any actions up to his confession as people (town at least...myself at least) were unknowingly operating on the basis of that lie. <br>\n<br>\n@ all.  Why did I not question pappums lie?  Typically when someone claims a PR...especially early in the game...I am very hesitant to believe them.  The reason I was willing to take pappums as legitimate was that he was implicating someone else and there was a way of confirming his claim.  IMO there would be no way someone would falseclaim a result on another player when there was a way of proving that result.  If VM were to have been lynched and turned out town...it would have been obvious (to me at least) that pappums was scum (or at the very least town not playing to the town's wincon).  I had no reason not to believe pappum based on the consequences I felt he would suffer if he was not telling the truth.  <br>\n<br>\nInstead...he appears to be getting a pass from many of the game and instead there is a growing wagon on the person who was the most committed to believing him.  At this point the only people who know whether pappums and voided are scum are scum...so how can the possibility of one and two mislynches be a negative against me (due to my actions from believing pappums' lie) when one or both of pappums could still turn out to be scum?  \n</div></blockquote>Pappums said not to quicklynch. Players were talking about the possibility of a gambit. The timing of his claim was in question. Those should be reasons to not blindly follow pappums to a hammer. At least to question pappums and get him to explain his thoughts more.<br>\n<br>\nYou say there's no point in trying to search for scumbuddies in that situation, but what is the harm in keeping the day open until everyone has at least reacted to the claims? These games typically last several months, they are meant to be slow. I don't think anyone's time was being wasted.<br>\n<br>\nSo have you never seen a gambit in one of these games?<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>havingfitz wrote:</cite>My comments towards pappums were made in regards to him expressing suspicions towards me...that has nothing to do with trust...that has to do with the knowledge he is off on his read.

See, here's my problem Pappums. As Scum, you could easily have planned this, to use that very excuse. Then, when it comes to play, you say the excuse, show how \"completely outrageous\" it would be for scum to do such a thing, and basically get a confirmed townie ride the rest of the game. One thing your plan didn't realize, is that I'm here. I've been scum more then I've been town, and I know EXACTLY how that mind set is, because I've done some similar things with EXACTLY the same motivation. Yes, you can say what you said and claim it to be outrageous but the fact of the matter is, you've done it, for the most part it was anti-town, and your a hypocrite.

This is anti-town. Your three main points, is that Fitz is \"trying to end the day early with a possible quick lynch.\" The hypocritical part, is did you, or did you not almost get VM lynched with your \"Pro-Town Gambit?\" The correct answer is, yes. You were but a few posts away. The reason he's not lynched? You got LUCKY nobody else voted while you were away. So in reality, while Fitz may or may not have been wanting the day to end early, the fact is, he's only one person. You on the other hand, deceived us about your ability (not that you don't have the ability, but that you used it at that time), and VM was within inches of getting lynched because of it. That's a BIG difference. Now let me break the above post down for one second.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>pappums rat wrote:</cite>to believe havingfitz is scum, you would need to believe scum would want to policy lynch someone who he claims is a vi, thereby bringing about a shorter day without any real scumhunting</div></blockquote>\n\nExcept for one small fact you seemed to conveniently overlooked. He was clearly in context, referring to if the day came down to a quick lynch, he'd like to propose someone that is a VI in order that though we may not know much, at least we'd get a future potential disaster out before that goes down. And who knows? He may flip scum.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>pappums rat wrote:</cite>endorse quicklynching vm after a suspicious early day one claim without scumhunting (once again, good for scum)</div></blockquote>\n\nYou DO realize you just accused him for believing you basically? It's not suspicious he believed you, it's suspicious that you'd be so deceitful friend. And what do you mean a suspicious early day one claim? Not many thought it was suspicious except maybe myself, and a FEW select others.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>pappums rat wrote:</cite>endorse lynching someone for using a gambit under the pretense of lynch all liars without scumhunting (are we seeing a trend, here?).</div></blockquote>\n\nYou keep saying he's not scum hunting. Have you read his posts? I'd strongly disagree. Anyone who reads his posts, will also strongly disagree. Though yes, he has his annoying moments, and his long posts can get tiring to read, you couldn't even BEGIN to argue the fact that he is indeed scum hunting.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>pappums rat wrote:</cite>the whole point of my gambit was to see the reactions people would have to there being a confirmed scum cornered, and then after the gambit was lifted people could scumhunt by looking for suspicious reactions. havingfitz has made every attempt to make this day shorter than it should be, which is antitown and scummy. the fact is that havingfitz has done no real scumhunting at all, and has been avoiding doing so all day. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">obvscum is obvious.</div> moar votes plz.</div></blockquote>\n\nAgain, you've completely misrepresented him, deceitfully made a case against him that for the most part is false, and now are calling for a lynch of your own?

You devolve into childish antics when confronted by the revelation that it was a gambit.  Strange that you were happy enough to go with the flow and lynch voided, but when that changes, you lash out against pappums for lying.  Tell me, what good reason would pappums have for revealing the gambit if he were scum?  I know of one, but I want to see what conclusions you reach.  As far as the bolded section is concerned, I'm talking about how you switch from being blindly sure that pappums is telling the truth to being blindly sure that he is scum.  The important word here is \"blindly\".  You seem determined to focus in on only one possibility, no matter the situation.  Why?  And yes, pappums admitted to lying.  I am generally pro-LAL and anti-gambit.  In this case, however, there is only one way that I can see pappums being scum, and just as many ways that he is town.  Thus he is neutral, regardless of the lie.

Or he is scum which I am starting to believe.  Your recent points on me do not hold any water and I will save town from another wallpost (this time) as I have made my points to all your accusations already I believe.  Speaking of not holding water...<br>\n<div align=\"center\"><hr style=\"height:14px;width:50%\"></div><br>\n@Jahudo...this comment, \"You trusted pappums. You are scum.\" is absurd.  I trusted pappums because he was in a cut and dry position that was provable.  Now he is in a cut and dry position in that he lied to town.  And why does your ~formula not apply to the others who put their vote on Void after pappums' lie?  <br>\n<br>\nWhat does it matter what gambits I have seen?  I stated I have not seen any like pappums'.  Does it matter that I have seen people claim PGO on D1 to avoid night actions (both as town and scum)?  I have obviously seen scum fakeclaim PRs...usually to no avail.  I have also seen town make dreadful PR claims which usually resulted in their lynching (when caught), some of which have forced the real PRs to counterclaim and out themselves.   None which implicated another player that I recall though.    <br>\n<br>\nOf the gambits you have provided, the Karma game was a good example but is not like this game in that 1 ) it occurred on the 3rd day when players had had a chance to assess/form opinions on each other and 2) ABR allowed his claim to result in a lynch (which he got lucky with).  Karma was similar to this game in that two players immediately (blindly?) laid down votes following ABR's fake claim.  No gambit talk or anything...and the voters were town. <br>\n<br>\nThe 2nd game you provide (which is ongoing so I am hesitant to discuss too much) was a similar \"gambit\" in that it occurred D1 (albeit later in the day) but was different in that two players were implicated...so there was still debate to be made.  I would not have advocated a ql in this case.  It should also be noted that votes were immediately cast as a result of the gambit, it only went on for 7-8 hrs, the gambitor somehow knew his targets alignment (??he called them both town??) AND the person suspected as a result of the gambit and lynched D1 was town.  I also note that you and pappums are in that game.<br>\n<br>\nAs for the 3rd game...which I note you are in...if the fakeclaim I think you are referring to is correct...it was that someone else was town.  Hardly the type of vote that would immediately produce a lynch so not relevant to this game.  If your were referring to a different fakeclaim in this game please feel free to point it out.<br>\n<br>\nThe fact is though...I have not been in a game where town fakeclaimed a PR that implicated someone else as scum and was therefore easily  proven.<br>\n<br>\nAlso...has anyone been in a game where given the result of a lynch...a town entering MYLO immediately conducted a No-lynch without discussion (ie a ql)?

If he HADN'T confessed, he'd be immediately lynched D2 for being exposed in an irretrievable lie. The way he did it, he's seen as towngambiting. I don't buy it.

In my eyes, its the unwillingness to let the gambit go as simply a way to provoke everyone to talk about things.

Anyone who disagrees with the fact that discourse is helpful to town is automatically anti-town. <br>\n<br>\nAnd fitz seems to be so opposed to it that he's attacking the one who started the conversations in the first place.

Is that what you are saying?  Awesome logic.  So if someone does something scummy but stops...it's ok.  And since he didn't believe me to be scum [Note to Cecily...have you noticed who neil's 2nd ranked lynch candidate is?] in the first place, it's ok that he resorted to names.  Yer guuuud.[/sarcasm]<br>\n<br>\nAnd thanks for explaining your vote.  In summary, it appears you are voting me because:<br>\n<br>\n1) My \"unwillingness to let the gambit go as simply a way to provoke everyone to talk about things.\"  Annnnd,<br>\n2) that I am \"so opposed to it [discussion] that he's [me] attacking the one [PR] who started the conversations in the first place.\"<br>\n<br>\nI would counter those points with:<br>\n<br>\n1) I'm unwilling to let it go because it forms the basis for my suspicions of PR.  It is not the only reason my vote is still on him.<br>\n2) Are you saying scum can't do things to provoke discussion?  Ridiculous.  And you are saying I am voting pappums because I do not like discussion and I am holding it against him?  That is a faulty analogy.  I would also note that you have not mentioned one word of suspicions towards me (that I can find) until the post you decide to vote for me.  Despite at various points suspecting Voided (and keeping your vote on him for a few days after the lie was confessed), neil (for saying mean things) and out of nowhere...me.  And what was your main reason for voting me again?  For being against discussion:\n<blockquote><div><cite>Cecily wrote:</cite>that said I don't think we need to wait the entire continuation of this day unless someone is going to admit to being scum, and I think it would be more useful to learn if Voided is actually scum or not <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">before continuing on with deliberations over who his buddies are.

Look not so much at her reasons for voting Void and neil (neither of which I had an issue with) but rather for her vote changes.<br>\n<br>\nAfter pappums' lie is confessed Cecily says she still finds VM suspicious and thanks him [PR], proclaiming he [PR] is now <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">\"pretty much cleared\"</div> in her book.  She then chooses to let her vote linger on VM.<br>\nWhen she does move her vote off VM and on to neil...its for neil's language, though she makes no mention of no longer suspecting VM.  Also, no suspicions of neil were mentioned prior to her vote so I would assume her only suspicion was his language.  I would ask people to note that she voted neil in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2881653#p2881653\" class=\"postlink\">post 235.</a><br>\nThen without any previously voiced suspicions of me, Cecily decides to vote me.  She determines neil no longer warrants her vote becuase <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">since he [neil] has claimed that he never actually believe fitz to be scum I feel like I can overlook the names as just a shift of character, and not as a scummy move.</div>  The trouble with this logic is that neil stated he didn't think I was scum both before (<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2880899#p2880899\" class=\"postlink\">post 223</a>) and after (<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2881351#p2881351\" class=\"postlink\">post 230</a>) his ad-hom attacks.  Her vote on neil came AFTER he had already stated he thought I was not scum.  So how can she vote him and unvote him for things he did prior to her vote on him?????  For those not paying attention...Cecily's post 235 came after neil's posts 223 and 230.  So how is this contradiction not obvious Cecily?  <br>\n<br>\nThen Cecily tapdances around her vote on Voided:   \n<blockquote><div><cite>Cecily p375 wrote:</cite>Yeah, fitz I'll admit I was all for lynching voided when everyone thought he was scum because everyone else was just as down. I was willing to do it because it would have helped us actually understand what was going on. That was before pappums admitted to gambitting.</div></blockquote> <br>\nFirst off Cecily...when do you think I was pushing for Voided's quicklynch?  BEFORE pappums admitted lying to us!  That's when.  How does that make your and my actions any different?  Are you even thinking about what you are posting????  I've given my reasons for wanting an early D1 scum result to have a quicklynch.  You were just as quick to vote him and echoed my sentiments with this comment:\n<blockquote><div><cite>Cecily p160 wrote:</cite>I don't think we need to wait the entire continuation of this day unless someone is going to admit to being scum, and I think it would be more useful to learn if Voided is actually scum or not before continuing on with deliberations over who his buddies are. We can always come back and re read these pages tomorrow, and knowing explicitly who is lying would definitely be better than throwing random guesses around.</div></blockquote>\nBut now you deceide to hold it against me.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Cecily p375 wrote:</cite>Now that pappums has come clean with his intentions I am no longer certain and I know that nothing other than night will come out of quicklynching. You still seem to think that killing someone is the best course of action. It isn't and trying to push it is scummy.</div></blockquote> <br>\nHe \"came clean\" with his ~intentions 10 days ago, before you voted neil.  So why are my actions with regard to pappums' lie (which your comments/actions were in line with) all of a sudden voteworthy?  I have not advocated any sort of quicklynch since pappums \"came clean\" so if you are inferring that you would be misrepping me.  If you aren't inferring that then why are you voting me?  And of course I think lynching someone [scum] is the best course of action...isn't that the object of the game?  Trying to push a lynch is scummy?  I guess that makes ten of us scummy by the current votecount.   <br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Cecily wrote:</cite>Don't quote me out of context, because I promise it will not work, I will call you on it, and it's making you look like you're flailing.<br>\n<br>\nThe only reason it looks like a contradiction is because the situation has changed.</div></blockquote>\nI am not flailing....I'm pointing out what is blatently clear.

It's frustrating to have one's top two suspects replace out, so this game is hard to get into.  I really just need to reread.  Here's at least something, my stance on the current two wagons:<br>\n1. The fitz wagon is nonsense, as far as I'm concerned.  The only thing I have ever disliked about his play (and it was a significant strike against him) was his suggestion of andrew as a policy lynch.  The more andrew posts, the less wary I am of that.  He's been posting and responding very much like I'd expect him to, and he's been scumhunting, which is more than I can say for other players.  His post #272 is a particularly good one against pappum, whose claim that being called a liar is a personal attack is baloney.  <br>\n2. That being said, I'm not sold on pappum's scumminess.  For one thing, I don't necessarily disagree with his gambit.  It's steered this town in a good direction.  I'd much rather lynch voided, as I said before, who hasn't really done anything since his wagon. Nonetheless, I have some problems with pappums's behavior <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">after</div> he revealed his gambit:\n<blockquote><div><cite>pappums wrote:</cite>all right folks, here's the dealy-o. to believe that i am scum, you would have to believe that scum would be willing to pull a suicidal move like that and at the same time repeatedly tell people not to mislynch and tell everyone your pm said you were sane (giving you no option to claim that your sanity was not assured after the supposed vm townflip). </div></blockquote>\nHis would not be the first gambit that the mafia ever faked.  What makes this scummy is that pappum's is insistent on reminding the town that because he played that gambit, he can't be scum.  The fact is, his stunt has bought him a lot of leverage, which he is using transparently.<br>\nSecondly, I don't like how terse his tone is when discussing with havingfitz.  His rudeness is over-the-top, particularly \"Fuck you\" and calling his posts \"rehashed bullshit.\"  It comes across as being a little faked.  <br>\n<br>\nI'm not voting him yet, as I need a reraed (as I said before).", "time": "Fri Mar 25, 2011 2:17 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=16813&start=400", "forum": "53", "thread": "16813"}

He seemed to take it as an attack on the town (which could be one way to interpret it), yet reacted much more forcefully than what everyone else expected. Up until a few posts ago, that was the scummiest behavior out of anyone in here and like I pointed out initially I like to assess people based off of how they react, not necessarily what they say. I agreed with pappums \"fuck you\" because the walls and baiting that fitz does are obnoxious and do seem at times to be mostly just to piss people off. <br>\n<br>\nNow, pappums is the one with overly emotional responses.

If/when rat was lynched and flipped town, he could go after fitz (who would be natural choice after a rat town-flip). Bang, boom, bop and the scum have two back-to-back mislynches with very little for the town to go on.

He attacked fitz a great deal, the main pusher of the rat wagon (which he was on). Even though he says that he doesn't think fitz is scummy, he still attacks him. He does very little actual pushing on rat, and spends most of his time attacking fitz.

She's taken the position that scum would want to take: split between both wagons ready to hop on the other one the next day.

Please choose the latter. </div><br>\n<br>\nMy original reason for voting fitz is because of his emotional responses to pappums gambit. He seemed to take it as an attack on the town (which could be one way to interpret it), yet reacted much more forcefully than what everyone else expected. Up until a few posts ago, that was the scummiest behavior out of anyone in here and like I pointed out initially I like to assess people based off of how they react, not necessarily what they say. I agreed with pappums \"fuck you\" because the walls and baiting that fitz does are obnoxious and do seem at times to be mostly just to piss people off. <br>\n<br>\nNow, pappums is the one with overly emotional responses. If I'm sticking with my original argument of voting based off of how people react, then his last post consisting of only obscene remarks definitely takes the cake. And because it will probably come up, I only defended pappums in his reasoning for the gambit. If anyone wants to call me out now for something else, please do, I may have forgotten, but defense of his actions was solely reserved for the gambit.<br>\n<br>\nI repeat, I was not consistently defending him, only agreeing with his reasons for voting fitz, so no fair calling me out on that for switching my vote.<br>\n<br>\nunvote<br>\nvote: pappums<br>\n<br>\nAnd I don't have time or energy to go over other people right now so, sorry.\n</div></blockquote>\n\nBold is mine.

So, if he was town, he should have realized that there was absolutely no way in hell that pappum's could be telling the truth, and thus should have resulted in him doing one of two things: 1) calling it out as a gambit, or 2) calling pappums confirmed scum.<br>\n<br>\nIn voided's response, he does neither of these things. He tries to weakly defect attention onto pappums with the \"maybe you're trying to protect your scumbuddy\" (which makes absolutely zero sense), and asks \"why would you choose me, pappums?\". But the nail in his grave is the golden nugget at the end, where Voided clearly believes pappum's claim and tells him that he isn't supposed to quote Role PMs. <br>\n<br>\nHe's also afraid to vote pappums even though pappums should be confirmed scum to him. Even after pappums makes a \"very suspicious\" post, even after Voided is told paranoid/naive cops are impossible, even after all bits of doubt are systematically taken away, he still insists on abstaining from voting pappums. It's like he's afraid to get into a 1 v 1 with him because he knows pappums is going to flip town, and thus he's going to be lynched.<br>\n<br>\nThen, there's voided's neighbor claim. He is told that his power is impossible several times, and yet doesn't back down or \"check his role PM\". Then, when Jahudo points out there is another \"Neighbor\" role that has that power, then he finally comes up with Neighborizer. <br>\n<br>\nThen, when he finally DOES vote pappums, he has the following reasoning:\n<blockquote><div><cite>Voidedmafia wrote:</cite>Because he thinks I'm scum and wants me gone. If you'll note, until he unvoted all his posts were about me being scum, and nothing else. I'm not counting RVS or anything before Idiotking confirmed to start the game, mind. After he unvotes me, he gets on Fitz and Jahudo for seeming overeagerness and the gambit suggestion, respectively. But other than that, it's been all me.

After all, scum don't think that anyone is scum because they know the scum already...<br>\n<br>\nAnd then, after pappums admits it's a gambit, THEN voided pushes for his lynch. It's like once reassured that pappum's isn't a one-shot cop with a guilty on him, then he's all gungho for the lynch because he knows he's not dead once pappums flips town.", "time": "Sat Apr 02, 2011 12:15 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=16813&start=550", "forum": "53", "thread": "16813"}

Unless something is explicitly stated it's either found to be arrogant, stupid, or unnecessary and I absolutely hate having to rephrase myself because someone wanted to misunderstand my intentions due to preconceived notions. Because that has happened. I'm not down for something like that again. <br>\n<br>\nI'm split between these two main wagons because, like I've been trying to get others to focus on, one or the other will most likely be lynched this day and I don't see the point in voting anyone else unless they really screw up. Both players have scummy aspects to them, and there is a chance that I'll switch my vote again, because the point of this game is to vote the person you think scummiest and that is what I'd like to do without being scrutinized for it. <br>\n<br>\nHaving said that, I don't like fitz's targeting of neil. Not that I'm saying neil is obvtown, but it really is seeming like he's only focusing on people who speak out about him. By tomorrow he could have even more people added to his list of 5 already possible scums, just because they question him. It's pretty much like he's saying \"I'm right and anyone who disagrees is obviously my enemy\" which is not protown at all. The point of having long days like this is to encourage discourse and to allow people to think about who they trust or not, and while it sucks having people think you scummy, there's no reason to go out and attack all of them. People have differing opinions, and that's life and attacking them is definitely not protown behavior. <br>\n<br>\nAnd woah I'm glad we had replacements in this game. We all pretty much totally overlooked those connections, thanks nacho. Those are some pretty convincing arguments and I must say I'm almost willing to change my vote over them.

It has been a long, exhausting day full of hysterical accusations. The sun is setting in the west. The crimson glow of the setting sun would be beautiful, had it not reminded you of the blood stained wrecking ball hanging in the distance.<br>\n<br>\nAll of a sudden, someone stands up. A finger is pointed at <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Voidedmafia</div>. \"You! I saw you last night. You were surveying, measuring your lot. You were making preparations to break ground for the supercenter weren't you? You're MAFIA!\"<br>\n<br>\n\"No, I, uh...\" stammered voided. \"I was just doing some landscaping. I was measuring out a plot for a garden.\"<br>\n<br>\nNo one seems to be buying the argument. \"A little late to be doing yard work, don't you think?\"<br>\n<br>\n\"Guys, I'm just your neighbor,\" refutes voided. \"You'll see, the garden plants will be in tonight. I'll call one of you over when they arrive and you'll see I'm not MAFIA!\"<br>\n<br>\nA voice calls out from the croud, \"Plants or no plants, it doesn't change a thing!\"<br>\n<br>\nDefeated, voided sighs and heads off towards his home. \"Alright, I'll leave. Just let me grab my things firs...\" - he is cut off mid sentence.<br>\n<br>\n\"No, you're leaving NOW!\" The mob grabs a hold of voided and begins dragging him out of town. Voided breaks free and runs. The mob chases. The chase ends at a ravine. Voided is cornered. \"It's over voided. There is no where left to run. Time to leave us to our peaceful town. We don't want the MAFIA here!\"<br>\n<br>\nVoided takes one last look at the group. \"But... it wasn't even me.\" He steps off the edge of the cliff, and a few seconds you all hear the sickening thud echoing up and down the ravine.<br>\n<br>\nYou all make your way back to town and search voided's home, finding nothing but Gardening for Dummies books. Voided was telling the truth afterall. \"It's been a long day,\" someone remarks. \"Let's get some rest, we'll deal with the MAFIA problem tomorrow.\"</div></div><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#008000\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Voidedmafia</div></div>, Town 1-shot Neighborizer, <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Went Splat</div> Day 1 (lynched)</div><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#008000\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">It is now night 1.

Everyone is enjoying a silent, peaceful night, until... The loud rumbling of an industrial diesel engine engulfs the neighborhood. The neighbors stir, but don't waken. At least not until the crack of the wreckingball crashing through Voidedmafia's front door is heard. Now you're all awake, all of you except <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Jahudo</div> that is. While most of you quickly head to the basement to attempt to escape the certain doom of the wrecking ball flying through your window next, Jahudo lays in bed peacefully with a smile on his face and his headphones blaring. <br>\n<br>\nIt's too bad he was not able to hear the whoosh of the wrecking ball being pulled back into attacking position. The chains moaned under the stress, and then, Bam! In one instance, half of Jahudo's house is gone. While he may have been unable to hear the destruction, the impact shakes the remainder of the house off the foundation and tosses Jahudo onto the floor. Within seconds, he's up and running. Down the stairs. Smash! Another section of the house disappears behind him. The front door is in sight. He rips it open only to find he staring at 50 tons of cold, black iron heading right towards him. Like a scene out of the Matrix, he's on the ground and the wrecking ball swings just above him, destroying the rest of the house. He stands up, relieved, and wipes his brow. Ooops, shoulda looked back. The rebound swing of the wrecking ball drives through jahudo as if he weren't even standing there, and launches him into the night sky.<br>\n<br>\nBut all the rest of you hear is the smashing of a second second house, followed by silence as the diesel engine shuts down for the night. The silence doesn't help, none of you sleep much in the next 3 hours before dawn. At dawn, you all head out curious to see what the commotion was about the night before. You notice voided's house is gone, expected due to the previous days activity. But you also find a pile a rubble where jahudo's house used to be. But no Jahudo (somewhere, approximately 3/4 of a mile a way in the forest, his remains dangle from the branches of an oak tree, never to be found). You search the rubble, searching for any clues. All you find is a note:</div></div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF0000\">We WARNED you. Take your stuff, leave now, peacefully.

I'd vote TO but my scum read on Pine is stronger so I'd prefer he die today. Pine's first D2 post is lollapalobvscum. If there's a third I'd lean toward P.T. but Pine said something at one point that indicated there are 2 scum so I'm thinking maybe 2 scum and a traitor or something to that effect.<br>\n<br>\nSorry in advance for the wall.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n-xalxe too apologetic for votes and joking posts 12 and 16<br>\n<br>\n-xalxe post 45 tries to throw suspicion on jahudo for putting idiot at 3 votes. xalxe unvotes - this is fishy. why is L-4 so terrible?<br>\n<br>\n-Idiot calls him on this and xalxe accuses him of OMGUS... wha?<br>\n<br>\n-Post 55 = possible connection between PT barnum and xtoxm.<br>\n<br>\n-So then Xalxe says &#8220;Heh. Heh. ITT I fail at math; I honestly thought you were within idiotscum (not to be confused with idiotking) quickhammah range. Plus it was a random vote anyway, and we've got a bit more info now.&#8221; which I don&#8217;t buy at all. He had TWO votes - how could he possibly have thought he was within quickhammer range? And if he DID think that, he wouldn&#8217;t have felt it necessary to say the &#8220;plus it was a random vote anyway&#8221; part.<br>\n<br>\n-andrew post 61 is strange. there are a lot of reasons to be voting xalxe at this point, but his telling jarudo not to answer a question aimed at someone else is not one of them.<br>\n<br>\n-cecily&#8217;s 76 seems town<br>\n<br>\n-PTBarnum 83 again looks like PT and xalxe could be buddies. He calls xalxe out for the crazy, but then distances himself/softens the accusation with the &#8220;I&#8217;m only pushing this point because...&#8221;<br>\n<br>\n-mike mike post 107 feels town<br>\n<br>\n-xalxe post 111 is scummy - sheeps cecily and then pretty much repeats exactly what she said in more detail and with weird things added to make it look like new content. (ie on the weird - that if pappums is scum, voided is most likely town unless this is a good pappum-voided gambit)<br>\n<br>\n-mikemike is town. no scum would dare rolefish as blatantly as mike mike did in 112.<br>\n<br>\n-Jinx 117 gives me town vibes. Unlikely that scum would post bragging that they were right about voided like this when they know he&#8217;s about to flip town.<br>\n<br>\n-xalxe post 123 looks very much like xalxe knows voided is town<br>\n<br>\n-xalxe post 126 - weird that he lists his scum reads as voided and pappums when it&#8217;d make more sense that one is town if the other is scum. Also, odd that he&#8217;s finally bringing up the post where PT Barnum defended him and calling it scummy.<br>\n<br>\n-xalxe 143 wanting to end the day early. post reads as though he knows pappums is gambiting<br>\n<br>\n-post 150 makes me think havingfitz could be town. I think scum, knowing voided would flip town, wouldn&#8217;t push ending the day early so hard <br>\n<br>\n-xalxe defends pappums and says there is no scum motivation for his gambit (when there is, obviously. gambit for town cred, coming clean to avoid being lynched D2 after voided flips town.)<br>\n<br>\n-neil calls him on this and says &#8220;How on EARTH could you make such a solid comment with so much clarity, unless of course you know who the scum and who the town are? In which case, that'd make you Mafia. Could this be a scum slip? Anyways may I ask you, apart from the obvious \"reaction fishing\" fallacy, how on earth do you see this at all to be town motivated?&#8221;<br>\n<br>\n-It's unlikely that scum would defend a buddy so blatantly, so probably xalxe is scum and pappums is town<br>\n<br>\n-Jahudo said in post 210 &#8220;If voided is town, scum had great incentive to get a hammer before pappums revealed his gambit. They would not have asked people to wait for pappums to answer questions, or asked the game to play out longer because a mislynch would mean an automatic day 2 wagon on pappums for not revealing the gambit sooner. Their best case scenario could be going into day 3 after two mislynches and minimal scumhunting. Even cautious scum wouldn't pass that up.&#8221;<br>\n<br>\n-Then Jahudo&#8217;s logic in 243 is that scum would&#8217;ve felt comfortable on the wagon and comfortable calling for a quicklynch. <br>\n<br>\n-I disagree completely and think the opposite of his conclusion is more likely. The fact that pappums had claimed an investigation would actually make scum more wary of being on the wagon, not less - the scum still knew voided was town (and therefore knew it was a gambit - either that or pappums is scum so they wouldn&#8217;t want to blatantly link themselves to it) so they would have been extremely hesitant - more so than regular wagons even. Xalxe and P.T. Barnum&#8217;s reactions are more cautious/scummy whereas Cecily and HavingFitz are less cautious/townie.<br>\n<br>\n-end of p. 9 - neil is town<br>\n<br>\n-Cecily p 242 townie<br>\n<br>\n-Jerbs 244 is scummy. Avoids commenting on much and says he wants pappums killed for lying.<br>\n<br>\n-PT post 270 says &#8220;Fair enough, though if I had been scum I probably would have assumed that voided was an SK. Pappum's claim as a gambit is still surprising to me.&#8221; This is interesting. I doubt any of the townies considered that pappums might have caught the SK. The fact that Pappums says this makes me wonder if this was his genuine reaction to Pappums gambit. He thought Pappums had found the SK. In spite of this, I think scum still would've been pretty hesitant with the wagon, since though they'd consider SK they'd know it was way more likely to be a gambit.<br>\n<br>\n-Idiot&#8217;s reasoning in 281 and 283 for thinking fitz is scum is exactly why I think he&#8217;s town. He says &#8220;He absolutely believed that pappums was town when pappums claimed cop, which is just a poor conclusion to reach, given that it could have been (and was) a gambit or a lie.&#8221; Only a townie would do that, because scum would know it was almost definitely a gambit.<br>\n<br>\n-neil 304 reads townie<br>\n<br>\n-Pine&#8217;s first post 316 pretty much confirms pappums as town and pine as scum. 332 is scummy - wants to end day early with pappum lynch and says his gambit gained no info. BS.<br>\n<br>\n-TO&#8217;s initial post raises flags for declaring pine town<br>\n<br>\n-pine 364 scummy - discusses mafia strategy and then unvotes and revotes pappums. fluff disguised as content<br>\n<br>\n-Pine 366 is scum guaranteeing a safe place on both leading wagons<br>\n<br>\n-371 - Pine guages town&#8217;s support for his mislynch of pappums<br>\n<br>\n-pine&#8217;s post 396 &#8220;Fitz has convinced me that Cecily should be suspect #1 on D2.&#8221; lolsheeping<br>\n<br>\n-Jahudo&#8217;s post 401 re: Pine&#8217;s scumminess is win. This post is probably why Jahudo was NK'd. (*high five* for drawing a NK as VT, Jahudo.)<br>\n<br>\n-Pine&#8217;s post 478 accusing TO of waffling and basically instructing her to vote (and the fact that TO ignored it completely) indicates a scum link between TO and Pine<br>\n<br>\n-Pine&#8217;s 487 is uber scummy. He says &#8220;I'm worried that if we wait for a replacement on PR, they're going to use the slack we all subconsciously give to replacements to their advantage. In my mind, PR's spot is confirmed scum, and I am concerned that a replacement is just going to wriggle out of it.<br>\n<br>\n-Hammer, please.&#8221; So not only is he trying to get pappums hammered before replacements can weigh in, didn't he earlier accuse others of being scummy for this exact thing (getting rid of a player about to be replaced)? - Need to look back at this.<br>\n<br>\n-Post 492 Pine indicates the game has 2 scum (he says getting his scum read pappums lynched would make it a \"one scum game\". Especially where it seems more likely there'd be 3 scum, this reeks of inside info.<br>\n<br>\n-Post 504 TO votes Pine without giving a reason and says she&#8217;ll move her vote &#8220;to where it will count&#8221; the next day. Pretty obvious and poor attempt at distancing.<br>\n<br>\n-525 Nacho puts the first vote on Voided. I'm very interested in this wagon, as scum would be motivated to make it happen as they know Voided is a PR that will be confirmed D2.<br>\n<br>\n-andrew had given me mostly town vibes but chkflip&#8217;s logic for supporting the voided wagon is weak.<br>\n<br>\n-bub 540 is townie, but he should&#8217;ve gone with Pine instead of Neil.<br>\n<br>\n-Pine 544 doesn&#8217;t address Bub&#8217;s points against him but instead disagrees that both wagons are unlikely to be scum.<br>\n<br>\n-Neil asked voided if there&#8217;s a way to test her role claim. This was a townie mindset.<br>\n<br>\n-Nacho had pretty solid reasons for restarting the Voided wagon. P.T. Barnum&#8217;s 573 is more sketchy. Mike makes a good point about it when he says, &#8220;If the neighbor-neighborizor thing was enough to lynch him on its own as you've said and said then why vote for Andrew here ? Seems a very woolly vote really...\"<br>\n<br>\n-Pine 577 again is scummy. Says he&#8217;s lurking because Nacho is a good player who might be able to worm out of the wagon. This makes more sense as a reason to be really active and posting to keep the pappums/Nacho wagon strong if he really thought he was scum, rather than a reason to hide. Pine should&#8217;ve just posted &#8220;I&#8217;m lurking because I&#8217;d absolutely love a Voided wagon but don&#8217;t want to draw suspicion by moving off Nacho and onto Voided, so instead I&#8217;ll just sit back and let things happen naturally.&#8221;<br>\n<br>\n-So then post 580 Pine says Nacho is scum so he's taking everything he says with a bucket of salt, but he&#8217;s making absolutely no attempt to refute Nacho or engage him in any way.<br>\n<br>\n-Pine 604 with mafia theory about neighborizer being a bad fakeclaim. Completely avoiding posting any content. Very clearly just sitting back and seeing which mislynch goes through.<br>\n<br>\n-bub&#8217;s vote i get town vibes from, but TO&#8217;s in 608 is scumtastic. also says &#8220;Pine I&#8217;m not keen on&#8221; which is the perfect thing to say about a scum buddy that you just voted but certainly never planned to try to get wagoned. (Keep in mind that she cleared Pine as town upon first replacing in and I don't recall her ever giving a solid reason for losing that. If in fact, she had found something Pine did scummy at some point she'd have mentioned it and she'd have acknowledged his soft accusation that she was waffling.)<br>\n<br>\n-So then we have Pine's hammer, which is possibly the scummiest hammer I&#8217;ve ever read. Says he&#8217;s going to post a case for Voided as town and then hammers her for saying she&#8217;d be willing to self vote to avoid a no lynch. It&#8217;s priceless that he says &#8220;I'm really, really torn now&#8221; and gives her playstyle instructions if she flips town and then immediately hammers. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">TOWN</div><br>\nCecily<br>\nHavingFitz<br>\nmikemike<br>\npappums/Nacho<br>\njerbs/bub<br>\nneil<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Scum</div><br>\nXalxe/Pine<br>\njinxx/TO<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Leaning scum - (maybe traitor?)</div><br>\nP.T.

I was not at that point willing to put someone to L2 or higher, there was no need to respond to the \"more voting\" part (I did vote lateron the grounds that my vote wouldn't do any harm being on some other suspicious player as I weighed up the existing wagons).

(Keep in mind that she cleared Pine as town upon first replacing in and I don't recall her ever giving a solid reason for losing that.

Most of 481 deals with the reasoning behind that post and my voting plan. Therefore your claims that I was ignoring it in order to distance are untrue (whether deliberately or not I'm not going to guess yet).<br>\nMy initial gut feeling towards Pine was that he was town, but subsequent posts and other players' analyses of them reversed my view bit by bit (as in there was no single thing that made me change.<br>\n<br>\nSince the event that you claimed showed a scumlink between Pine and I never occurred, do you still believe that I am part of a scumteam?

Case in point: in the very same post that you accuse me of tunneling, you yourself admit to tunneling. Hypocracy much? Furthermore, you tell me to do real scum hunting in a post where you don't do any real scumhunting. This post doesn't ask any player tough questions, doesn't pressure any player, doesn't attempt to find scum in any way. All it is trying to do is to get two people of his back, a very scum mentality.

How is it old and irrelevant just because you addressed it? And how did I imply that you ignored it? I listed a LOT of posts I thought were scummy and rarely if ever mentioned anyone addressing them. What makes you so special? And nice little veiled accusation that I'm scum there. You really think I'm scum JUST because I didn't pay homage to you addressing that?<br>\n<br>\nHere's the main reason I don't give your response to mike much weight. You said this yesterday:<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>PT wrote:</cite>We should vote who we want to vote until we're under the pressure of a deadline (six days does not qualify) or there is a compelling reason to end the day (there isn't)</div></blockquote>. <br>\n<br>\nAnd yet, in spite of making that statement you did exactly the opposite re: voided. If you really thought his claim was enough to lynch him then he'd have been who you wanted to be voting. You'd have fought for that wagon. Instead, you voted andrew and basically said \"I don't have any faith in this wagon, so when it gets closer to deadline I'll hop on the largest wagon.\" (Bolded below):<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>PT wrote:</cite>I like lynches on these two. I don't know which is more likely to get a wagon, so I'm going to go out on a limb and say andrew, just because Pine is still a fresh face. If there's interest in Pine I'll switch immediately.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: andrew</div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Come deadline time, if we continue to limit our choices to fitz and pappums, I'll vote pappums, as I've already said. But I hope that can be avoided.</div>\n</div></blockquote>\n\nWhen you vote Nacho, the only reason you give is that you don't think fitz is scum so you better jump on the Nacho wagon! Here's the post:<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>P.T. Barnum wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>voided wrote:</cite>Everyone else not voting Fitz/Nacho: Guys, there's three days left, and we'll no lynch if Fitz or Nacho aren't lynched. Unless you can whip up some amazing case to persuade the majority to someone else, WE NEED TO LYNCH ONE OF THEM TODAY IF AT ALL POSSIBLE!</div></blockquote>\nI agree with this, much as I don't like it.<br>\nI don't think havingfitz is scum.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Unvote<br>\nVote Nacho</div></div></blockquote>\n\nAt this point there were 3 days left and then there was even an extension. So what happened to the \"We should vote who we want to vote\"? Every one of your votes are terrible. You don't try to make a solid case, you don't pressure the person you're voting and you don't really try to get your suspect wagoned. And then it turns out that the whole time you really wanted Voided wagoned. And yet you never voted her when there was plenty of time to get a wagon going if you were so sure she was scum, or even brought up much against her in the first place to try to keep momentum on her original wagon.  Here's the post where you finally voted her (in spite of your supposed surety she was scum because of her claim):<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>P.T. Barnum wrote:</cite>If there's renewed interest in a voided wagon I'm totally up for that.  I particularly like his recent appeal to newbieness- that's a last resort if I've ever heard one.  The neighbor-neighborizor bit, as I've said and said, would be enough to lynch him.<br>\nBesides, the deadline's been extended.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Unvote <br>\nVote: voided</div></div></blockquote>\n\nSo I agree with Mike that if you thought voided was scum all along because of her claim, it makes no sense that you dropped her entirely the way you did. And your \"well, it didn't look like the wagon was going to happen\" looks pretty weak when she ended up lynched yesterday. Your hesitancy to actively push a wagon and really be the driving force between getting someone lynched looks terriscummy.<br>\n<br>\nSo here's the nutshell of your response that you want us to think should make the whole point against you go away: <br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>PT wrote:</cite>There are a few people in this game with satisfactory reasons for a lynch. You seem to be saying that once someone commits a bad scumtell, every subsequent post and vote of mine should be devoted to lynching them. I don't think that's useful.<br>\nWagons lead to reactions. Voided had his wagon, and I didn't think there was any interest for a future one. I tried to start one on andrew. Since we're so close to lynching, though, I figure lynching voided is far superior to lynching the other two.<br>\nAnd yes, I did forget about voided somewhat, but I guess I got bored with [her] and wanted to stir the pot.</div></blockquote>\n\nIf you really thought she was scum and thought the claim was from certain scum, you wouldn't forget about her. Only scum forgets what their reads are supposed to be. And as for the \"every subsequent post should be devoted to lynching them\" somewhere in the middle would be nice. All you do is \"stir the pot\" with a <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">very</div> small spoon, and it's the equivalent of laying low. I'm not saying you have to tunnel, but you should make SOME kind of effort to actually get your suspects wagoned instead of just hanging out and waiting for others to do the work (and therefore be targeted with the suspicion) and waiting to put your vote on the biggest wagon. This is what you did, and it's scummy.", "time": "Sat Apr 09, 2011 11:58 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=16813&start=650", "forum": "53", "thread": "16813"}

Even if voided had been scum, any information that he could have given up before his lynch would have been helpful, at least in determining who he didn't want to be lynched (ie. scum). The fact that Pine went against everything he said he was going to do initially and hammered before voided had his chance to speak is very anti-town. Any town player would have allowed voided to have a last word, especially because he was in fact town. And not wanting someone to self lynch is stupid, especially because we had a little while longer before the day would have been forced to end. If anything Pine could have waited another few hours for voided to get one last post in like he had requested, but no. Pine hammered. That is why I believe he is scum. <br>\n<br>\nWhat I was trying to do last (real) night was read through and see who was avoiding confronting or questioning Pine and because I was very tired I may have missed a few things, but I started my previous post with the intention of calling out PT.

Day 1, I was so set on the Pappums lynch that I had really tunneled and not payed much attention to everyone else unless for some strange reason, I was brought up by them. I then went over the cases people presented against Voided and there were only two that stuck out to me. One I kind of dismissed, because I'm always cautious when it comes to the person hammering.

I believe you're town, and I know I am, so arguing with you won't do the town much good. If you still feel the need to lynch me, so that you can see you're wrong for yourself, feel free too. I believe once in awhile, everyone has to realize they're wrong at some point and if it takes my lynch to show you that, so be it. But the reason I'm defensive, is because you've now tunneled with your perception on me. You have no real suspicions, and I have looked over your ISO. Your cases aren't real. They are fabricated, stretched, perspectives that you've used my own words and changed them around or taken them out of context. I still have yet to see a single good point you've brought up that I have not acknowledged lately.

When does anyone ever agree with points made against them?  Town knows there town and wouldn't support criticisms and scum don't want to get caught so they don't support criticisms.  You saying I don't have good points is meaningless.  It's what others think about them that matters.  And show me one place where I have changed your words or taken them out of context.  You are hyper sensitive and that IMO is suspicious.

Yes, I've been quite active on the site and silent here. To be perfectly honest, I've put this off. Why? Because Setael's case is incredibly thorough, well-researched, and seemingly air-tight. For quite some time, I was thinking to not even bother, and just post my reads and let my flip clear both me and those reads. But like I said, I find that kind of attitude very anti-Town, bordering on playing against wincon. While doing an archive binge of one of my favorite webcomics, I came across the above strip, specifically the last panel.<br>\n<br>\nI know, it's not exactly applicable. But with a little adjustment, it can easily be applied to Mafia. \"Scum don't have scumhunting cases. They have cleverly consistent fictions.\" The only way I feel someone could have arrive at such a seamless conclusion is with their objective pre-determined prior to making the case. A clever manipulator can twist almost any set of facts, especially a set that includes such a <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">glaring </div>error as my ill-advised hammer, into whatever kind of case they want. And to put it plainly, Setael's mind was made up far, far before he ever got to my first post.<br>\n<br>\nIf you look at his wall case against me, it is largely and strongly based in Xalxe's play, which I have already decried as amateurish and misleading. I've been worried since the start that someone would do a serious analysis of Xalxe's play and arrive at the conclusion I arrived at. When I replaced in, I decided to read the thread before looking at my role PM. I was fairly convinced at that time that Xalxe had pulled scum and that pappum's rat was our partner. I was <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">shocked </div>when I found <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF00\">Town Tracker</div></div> in my role PM.<br>\n<br>\nI maintain that, while Setael may or may not be scum himself (and I'm trying not to be biased about him here), his entire (legitimate) case is based on Xalxe's truly bad play and my hammer of Voided. The rest of the case comes from that conclusion, after which all of my posts were irrelevant except as fodder for advancing his case.<br>\n<br>\nNext post in a series of three: Why I hammered, and the case for Voided as Town that I never finished.

I admit, Pine I do like your claim and there really is no way for someone to argue a tracker claim, but the truth of the situation is that somebody is lying. I'd be more inclined to believe such a claim if it were a more influential PR (such as doctor, cop, etc) and no one called you out for having the same role. I've been in a game where there were legitimately two trackers and while it confused us all, neither of them were lying and there was legitimately no way for anyone to argue it. With or without your claim, I believe setael's reads on you because they were so thorough and I honestly can't find a place to argue with them. <br>\n<br>\nWhether or not it is fair, you came in after xalxe who did make a lot of mistakes and I'm still willing to vote for you because of those.

Everyone in this game seems for the most part level headed and no one has just been throwing claims around (other than pappums, but thats another story).</div></blockquote><br>\nAlso this. I think townies are way more likely to admit to not having scum reads on anyone. Scum is careful to have <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">some</div> suspects.<br>\n<br>\nBut actually, while ISOing her again I started doubting my read. She repeatedly says \"I'm going to be honest...\" which made me raise an eyebrow since scum would more likely be of the mindset that they have to convince us they're being honest. Also I don't like a few of the things she said re: the Pine wagon.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Cecily wrote:</cite>Alright, I'm not thoroughly convinced. I admit, Pine I do like your claim and there really is no way for someone to argue a tracker claim, but the truth of the situation is that somebody is lying. I'd be more inclined to believe such a claim if it were a more influential PR (such as doctor, cop, etc) and no one called you out for having the same role.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Cecily wrote:</cite>Someone is lying because someone (or a few people) are always lying in this game. It seems very unlikely that both people who were attacked by seteal's post come out to be town oriented PRs and since I'm more willing to believe TO's claim because it can be proven via night actions I'm going to assume that Pine is lying about his role. <br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Cecily wrote:</cite>I understand that we all want Pine lynched. I will be very happy if I get to hammer, but we do still have at least a week left in this day and I don't see what the whole mentality of voting asap just to make sure you were a part of the unanimous decision is all about.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Cecily wrote:</cite>The only reason I wasn't on the Pine wagon was because I didn't log on in time to get my vote in before Pine lynched himself and I thought we were waiting at L-2 in order to keep the day going, but then fitz put us at L-1 and in came Pine before I could get my vote in. Otherwise I would have been all over it. </div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nShe was way too eager to get town cred for Pine's lynch, and the whole someone is lying thing is weird. It's a stupid reason to be certain one of them is lying, and then the \"someone is always lying\" is just backtracking. I think she knew Pine was lying because she's his buddy.<br>\n<br>\nAlso, the fact that she keeps asking people to give reasons for suspecting her, which is something I've realized I do as scum.<br>\n<br>\nWoo! 360! <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">unvote, vote: Cecily</div>", "time": "Mon May 02, 2011 3:29 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=16813&start=850", "forum": "53", "thread": "16813"}

What is your case on chkflp and on me?   <br>\n<br>\n<div align=\"center\"><hr style=\"height:14px;width:50%\"></div><br>\nLooking at the Day one lynch....four (Nachomamma8, P.T. Barnum aka Faraday, chkflip, Bub Bidderskins) of the seven players remain from the Void mislynch.  One of the dead has been ID's as scum...I find it hard to believe on a 7 player mislynch that there is not at least one other scum member (and I am assuming there are three scum).  As I do not think chkflp is scum...that leaves me with Nacho, Faraday and Bub.  I'm not confident enough to put a vote on any of them ATT though.  <br>\n<br>\nOf the four remaing players alive off the Void mislynch I think there could be one scum (havingfitz, mikemike778, Idiotking aka Setael, Cecily).  Discounting myself of course...that leaves me with three.  I do not think Setael is scum based on his case on Pine (though it would have been a perfect time to bus a partner given Pine's poor play and scummy hammer) and between mikemike and Cecily...I suspect Cecily significantly more than I do mikemike (see earlier ISO sampling in this post).  I would also note that I had Pine <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2932775#p2932775\" class=\"postlink\">2nd on my suspect list</a> D1 before he hammered Void and voted him in my first post on D2.  I also voiced D1 suspicions on Pine in my <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2900671#p2900671\" class=\"postlink\">ISO 56</a> and <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2924139#p2924139\" class=\"postlink\">ISO 57</a>.<br>\n<br>\nAs for the D2 Pine wagon....I could see there being at least one partner bussing him which (not counting myself) leaves Faraday, mikemike, and Nacho.  As I am leaning against mikemike being scum ATM that gives me, once again, the toss up between Nacho and Faraday.  They are too close for me to choose between but if I had to I'd probably lean towards Faraday.  I definitely think there is at least one scum not bussing their partner Pine...which leaves us with Bub, Setael and, once again, Cecily.  I leaning town on Setael and between Bub and Cecily it's once again significant suspicions towards Cecily guiding my vote her way. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">tl:dr;</div> I'm not convinced chkflp is scum so I will not change my vote from Cecily.", "time": "Tue May 03, 2011 4:35 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=16813&start=900", "forum": "53", "thread": "16813"}

I can think of a few reasons you didn't NK me last night. I know it wasn't to avoid it pointing to you, since I agree that I'd be a fairly logical NK after taking down Pine (in spite of the haters who said otherwise yesterday.) Rather, it's likely a combo of the following:<br>\n<br>\n1) You think I'm a weak enough player that I won't be able to convince the town to lynch you, therefore rendering my NK unnecessary (sad face)<br>\n2) You know that your accent has an unexplainable power over me and you can use it to bend my will to yours<br>\n3) You know that I don't trust myself enough and could pretty easily be talked out of pursuing my scum reads<br>\n4) This game wouldn't be nearly as fun for you if I wasn't in it. (Who's digging for compliments now?)<br>\n<br>\nPT was scum, so you're scum. I also think that if Cecily is really scum and you were really town, you'd have picked up on it yesterday (or at least supported my brilliant case on her) and Cecily would've been the lynch. A lot of the things you're saying don't sit right, like you clearing Bub just for one post Jerbs made and me for that matter when I could've been bussing, and being so sure you have the last 2 scums pegged. I also am suspicious of your claim. I don't think there'd be a 1-shot gunsmith in a game with a traitor, which I think is the scum setup. There's no way to disprove it, so it's a good scum claim and I agree with Cecily that PT would've used it already if he'd had it.<br>\n<br>\nIsn't it a rule that there can only be one non-normal role in this type of mini? And aren't neighborizers and gunsmiths both non-normal roles? Please don't make me read the wiki.<br>\n<br>\nI'm not sure what to think about Cecily.

You knew you were up for a lynch if chk flipped town, so your motivation to fake claim is to avoid that happening. If enough townies believe your claim, it would likely save you. Especially where Cecily is one of your targets, she should be pretty easy to get lynched after yesterday's wagon.<br>\n<br>\nToday's posts have drawn my attention to Bub, since both Faraday and Cecily cleared him with really weak reasoning. An ISO of Bub is pretty damning, actually. He's posted relatively little and helped lynch Voided without getting his hands dirty. All he said was he agreed with the case and preferred it to the other wagons. He maintained that Neil was his strongest scum read when he voted Voided and again after my Pine case. That post is suspicious (ISO 20) since he doesn't really comment on the Pine case, just says \"I agree that Pine is scummy as well\" and FOSes him. He then asks Neil what Neil thinks of the Pine case, even though Bub didn't comment on it.<br>\n<br>\nHe doesn't comment on Pine again until after the tracker claim and then these 2 posts:<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Bub wrote:</cite>Hmmm, Pine's post seems wordy and desperate. He knows he's in a corner and is trying to find a way out of it with a cleverly disguised OMGUS. <br>\n<br>\nPine, who did you track last night?<br>\n<br>\n*********<br>\n<br>\nMikemike seems like a terrible tracker choice. I've never played as a tracker before, but I assume that you would want to target somebody who you thought was scum to try and get them targetting the night kill. Right?<br>\n<br>\nPine: Why mikemike and not a scum suspect?</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nSince he managed to avoid saying much about Pine before these posts, it seems likely he felt he had no choice but to bus. Even then, he still doesn't push Pine at all or add to his case or ever vote him. These posts were probably just to distance.<br>\n<br>\nHis first post after pine's flip is highly suspicious now that chk flipped town. He votes chk using the reason I had provided the day before, which was weak in the first place. If he were town I think he could've come up with his own reason, and a better one.<br>\n<br>\nSo then there's this post:<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Bub Bidderskins wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Nachomamma8 wrote:</cite><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: Cecily</div><br>\n<br>\nShe waffled on the Pine wagon yesterday A LOT, which suggests that she was unsure of which position to take on her scumbuddy's wagon.

I find this a bit more damning that chkflip's play because he at least was consistent.<br>\n<br>\nPT Barnum, havingfitz, and mike are pretty much confirmed town at this point.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nI agree, except I would at Satael to the list of town. He basically orchestrated the Pine lynch. That leaves:<br>\n<br>\nNacho<br>\nChk<br>\nCecily<br>\nMyself<br>\n<br>\nI know I'm town, and I've got a town read on Nacho (pine's constant attacks on Pappums vouch for him). So that leaves Chk and Cecily as the remaining scum simply by the process of elimination, without even getting into the cases on those two.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nThis is suspect because he sheeps Nacho in clearing PT Barnum, havingfitz, and mike for pretty much nonexistent reasoning. (He later says he cleared PT because he was the first vote on the Pine wagon, but then when it's pointed out he was actually 3rd he just says \"oops, yeah.\") I'd like to know what he thinks of the list he gave here now that Cecily and himself are the only ones left in his list of possible scum. If Bub is scum, based on this post I'd say his buddy is Faraday, fitz or mike.<br>\n<br>\nHis next several posts are asking simple questions without any analysis at all and then he attacks PT, but as soon as Faraday replaces in he drops all suspicion of PT.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">mod: Did Bub pick up his 'day has started' prod?<br>\n</div>", "time": "Mon May 09, 2011 9:15 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=16813&start=975", "forum": "53", "thread": "16813"}

If I'm scum I don't know what power town have left and risk exposing myself to a counterclaim from an investigative role or w/e (hint there won't be, it's just me). if I REALLY want to lock it onto me and cecily why not claim a guilty somewhere?</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nNow that no investigative role has flipped, I'm more inclined to believe Faraday, since I don't see scum claiming an investigative role when there could be a full cop out there. If he's lying the only PRs the town had were 2 1-shot Neighborizers (assuming Mike is telling the truth, which I think is likely), and a neighborizer is the weakest no use role ever. It can be a scum role so it doesn't confirm anyone to us. Even if there are only 2 scum to make up for the lack of town power, it still doesn't seem very balanced. Frankly, even with a 1-shot gunsmith and 2 1-shot Neighborizers, there could be just 2 scum since this is the weakest town setup I've ever played.

I think it's the only realistic way to balance a 2 scum group set-up but on the other hand something like 1-shot rb'er, or 1-shot rolecop would make much more sense?

We can fairly much assume mikemike's not the traitor, as he'd know the mafia and be able to neighbourise one of them.

I mean, I dunno I think the town are fairly weak here if scum have any sort of pr, and even without it. plus there's the fact I as scum would have no idea if there was a hidden investigative role and would be risking myself to a watcher/tracker/cop/gunsmith god knows what counterclaim.

Eh.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF4000\">B) Mikemike is a scumneighbouriser. </div>This is possible, definitely possible. 2 1-shot neighbourisers on each side is pretty cool, actual has nice parity. vig/gunsmith is probably enough to balance the role.

This doesn't clear TO completely as scum could themselves have an extra kill one night but TO seems pretty risk averse to me - the way the game's gone so far, I don't see her fake claiming this.<br>\n<br>\nPine is obviously going to be the lynch for today ... was probably still trying to fabricate his story when he was rushed into revealing it before he was ready (he hadn't got to the bit about who he was going to track yet it seems).<br>\n<br>\nNontheless plenty of time no rush, we can wait a bit for his second and third posts before rushing anything.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nAnd that was it for the day.

Faraday had a chance to hammer Bub and now mikemike had the chance to hammer Cecily.  Based on the assumption I am working with that there are two scum still alive...I do not think it would be unreasonable to have one scum bus the other.  That said...if Bub was town, and I am town (based on I know I am and based on Faraday's investigation result)...that would mean two of Faraday, mikemike, Cecily and Setael are scum.  Setael is being viewed as town because of her push on Pine...Faraday is being viewed as town for his unopposed claim and how it fits in the game plus his accurate investigation result.  This would leave Cecily and mikemike as scum.  But mikemike was on the Bub wagon when it was at L-1 and I noticed Cecily online ATT as well....which was why I unvoted suddenly.  If Bub was town and Cecily is scum as many suspect...I think she had a short window to hammer Bub for the win (assuming 2 scum left). <br>\n<br>\nI'm rambling a bit...it's late and I need to sleep.  <br>\n<br>\nSo mikemike has a chance to hammer Cecily but is waiting for some reason.  What was the reason again?  <br>\n<br>\nAlso...why do people keep bringing up a traitor?  I've never even played in a game that had one before so I find it amusing it keep being brought up.  If there is a traitor...does that person even know s/he is a traitor?  Is a traitor town until recruited/shanghai'd by scum?  If so...wouldn't the traitor have been selected before this point in the game?  I'm not sure what good it does to bring up the possibility of there being a traitor of only one scum left.  I hope there is one scum left and that it is Cecily.  And if there is a traitor (which I hate even hypothesizing about because I don't think there is), if they arean't scum yet then everyone who has a town aura about them is still open to suspicion.  Which only helps scum as it braodens the pool of reasonable/likely suspects.  And for those who think it may be me....if I don't know I'm one...and Faraday used his inv on me last night....then I still haven't been recruited into the scum group.  So I'm not sure why that option is being tossed around.  Still rambling.

She didn't put up much of a fight as the noose was placed around her neck. when the chair was kicked away, her neck didn't snap as intended. Instead, she hung there silently suffocating.

Inside the house, mike heard the door open as he was lying in bed. He heard the footsteps coming up the stairs. He saw the figure enter his room, with a gun in his hand. Terrified, mike trembled out a few words: \"Are... are.. you gonna kill me?\" The gun started to raise. Mike closed his eyes, knowing it was the end. Nothing happened. He opened his eyes and realized the figure was simply switching on the light. It took a few seconds for mike's eyes to come into focus.

My intention was, the traitor would use the neighborizer ability to try to neighborize a goon. The 1-shot for both neighborizers only counted as a shot if they successfully created a neighbor. The neighborizer action happens last after night kills, so if a player the neighborizer targeted was killed, the neighborizer attempt would fail and thus not count as a shot. However, the 1-shot vig mechanic was such that it counted as a shot if you pm'ed me a target - if it failed, the shot was gone. Thats why I didn't want to answer the 1-shot mechanic questions. But hey, I'm a new mod, I can learn things too. Going forward, I'll have a policy of not answering questions about anything that would be included in a role PM. 1-shot mechanics, included in a role PM.

I disagree.  You are speaking from the perspective of knowing it was a gambit while D1 unfolded.  Town wasn't so fortunate.  It completely derailed any legitimate scumhunting that I, Void, or pappums could have done if it hadn't occured.  And knows how Setael and Faraday would have viewed it if they experienced it.
