If we assume that, and then lead a lynch onto another person, who hypothetically is scum, and claims VT instead of something like doctor, we would see them as more town for not trying to claim doctor and out the real doctor through counter claim? What if we get a vote on the real doctor and scum fakeclaims? Actually I'll just stop here cause I'm pretty confused at this point.)

These two are the guys I'm most interested in right now because they seem able to produce logic I can follow and hold against them if they're scum.

I'm not seeing the same issues with Windblown as other people are, but I don't really know him. So it's mostly a moot point. I think he's town. Regarding Mhork, I'm still a bit uneasy considering who he replaced and his full-blown assault against Yes^3. I'm taking Garruk's word for it since he's right about the DB wagon in Cash Cabd.<br>Miniscule Town: Marquis<br>I haven't been getting scum vibes from Marquis. The wagon against him was bad, and I'm still holding it against Mhork's slot regarding the way it happened.<br>Null: Wake, Redtail<br>I liked Raven earlier in the game, but IAI makes a good point regarding the way Raven was poking around the thread. Wake hasn't made an impression either way since his replacement, and it concerns me.

Anyone that has a scum read on any of these should reread those days and watch their interactions with Garruk and see if they still agree or not and declare that in thread.<br><br>3) RC, I too was wary of fuzzy. But not of you and know that your role is one that could be a game changer late game and one that mafia won't want to keep around. So if fuzzy was town, I wanted to force scum's hand to kill him last night and get one less questionable player off the table. Two players attacked me for that in D2 twilight (JKLM and windblown?), but it was the right move. I would love them to explain how it wasn't.<br><br>4) Prior to my reread, my scum reads with fuzzy dead still fall in {redtail, windblown, and JKLM}. Salmonella is another that is one I am second guessing and keeping an eye on during my reread.<br><br>5) I don't think Gaiden is scum, but not because of my original \"conftown\" reason that his predecessor wanted to be a replace in. Someone produced another game where someone did the exact same thing, and it wasn't the request itself, but the mod reaction that sold me. But Cheery's reaction in that other game was very similar to notscience's in this game, so scratch that. But his vote hopping isn't coming off to me as scummy, it is usually the quiet ones you who don't take too many stances early that you have to watch out for.<br><br>6) We now are 99.9% confident that Brian died N1 due to hiding behind scum Garruk. That means one of three things happened: a) scum did not try to kill someone N1, b) they tried to target someone and we have a power role that prevented that c) or they targeted Brian. Putting pcts to it, \"a\" has almost 0 chance, \"b\" has little chance, so it is likely \"c\". With that in mind, read my question and redtail's initial answer to it from D2. He seemed convinced that Brian died initially because scum targeted him. His answer felt like a well crafted scum response, up to and including the usually included \"I probably would have made a similar choice in their position, regardless of those players' reads\" statement. The fact he seemed so certain Brian was targeted by scum could be a scum slip.<br><br>7) So yes, I would likely be voting redtail had I not wanted to do this reread first. But we have time, so I ask for a few days. In the meantime, the three people that voted me or suspect me, I'd like to hear your reasons. Esp why D2 I got to asking questions about why Brian died rather than \"help my teammate Garruk by voting Mork\" who was probably around L-2 at that point. I'd like to hear your reasoning on that, as well as based on #6 above, why IAI's team would have targeted Brian N1 when Brian and I were town reading each other. Point being, you can't explain things, so I want to see where your cases lie, and which of you are scum with no real case, but just looking for a low poster to attack."}

(Saw the post where Garruk said he was 60% sure what it was, don't know if that was bull or not).<br><br>2) I think it is likely one of Garruk's teammates joined the quick wagon day 2 that got Mhork to L-2. Which points to one of Gaiden, SD, redtail.<br><br>3) Looking back at 504, which was Garruk's read list, I still think at least one scum was in the lean town group of 4. Knowing I am town and suspecting Mhork is too, that leaves one of Wake/Windblown. Which probably means one of Red Tail/SD are the other (due to process of elimination, also lines up nicely with #2 above). See my post 903 for more specifics.<br><br>4) The quick marquis wagon D1 likely had at least 1 scum on it, which points unfavorably to SD and JKLM (see my posts 904/905 for more details).<br><br>5) Garruk choosing the fuzzy wagon over the larger marquis wagon D1, makes me wonder if he was distancing from other scum on the marquis wagon. Points unfavorably at JKLM, and likely does not make both SD and windblown the last 2 scum (see my post 925 for details).<br><br>No longer leaning towards windblown as much. One of the JKLM, redtail, SD will be getting my vote.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">@ JKLM</span>, you are on a wagon of 1.

Which is the only thing you can point at, because Fuzzy died. Not some other random player, but fuzzy, who at least 2 of us (RC and myself) still did not trust up until his flip.

It's up to you. I'd rather vote redtail/SD, but this game is not going to be won on D3.

Admittedly, my second accusation that he tried to control the interpretation, comes with this post where he expresses doubt about the Mhork wagon.  The whole stream of events bugs me. The first that is to be investigated was Brian's post to look for any hints as to who he hid behind. Garruk knew it and tried to speed the day along, hence the 'unnaturally' fast wagon.

You are not trying to discourage Mhork, but I don't want him to be discouraged. I hope you recognise the difference. I'd rather he kept up the fight rather than going silent. If we lynch scum today we almost certainly still have a fight tomorrow. I want Mhork talking as much as anyone else so that tomorrow we have the information we need.<br><br>2. Drat. I was hoping that Emp would point out my soft acceptance of his vote. I've dropped two opportunities for him (I'm not suggesting he has been around, but they've been dropped nonetheless). Oh well."}

With their buddy on the outs, scum are in a very uncomfortable position and would be paying close attention to what they say here. JKLM, however, seems to be posting what he's thinking as he thinks it, with very little attention paid to how he sounds (which is actually pretty terrible from a scum perspective.)

It should be obvious that replacing out is better than staying in and not caring about the game, especially if the mod is ns or whatever other reasons he uses for staying in. Obviously if he's scum putting on the apathetic front, or even if he is apathetic scum but is not getting lynched (and therefore doing well as scum) then there is no reason to replace out. It's only when he's actually pressured to do so that he replaces out, despite making a big deal about how he doesn't care about the game to the point where it's over the top.<br><br>I struggle to find much that's alignment-relevant from Empking's posts. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\"><br><br>Empking, why is Lord Mhork town?<br><br>~~<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Dorcas/Gaiden</span><br><br>Despite the other game, I still think that <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5392314#p5392314\">221</a> is pretty town. The 'I replace the next guy' line really doesn't make sense from Dorcas if he's scum, because that would have obvious implications, and he seems so genuine about wanting to get back in that it can't be a cheeky act to make his slot look more town.

What's more he uses the replacement as an excuse not to lynch his scumread JKLM (flipped scum) despite earlier saying that Marquis should be lynched regardless. And bringing someone to L-1 when you have two actual scumreads and it's not close to deadline is just ???. But is it too ??? to be scum?? And is this furthering the town some kind of townie delusion or scum just making stuff up? But then why would scum vote Empking?

I had him down as strong lean town in my imaginary play book and that 'observation' was supposed to be the clincher where I convinced myself that he was probably town. This approach really backfired throughout the game and I was struggling with the consequences of placing my bets down too early without considering all of the possibilities first.<br><br>@Radiant, Short answer: No.<br><br>it's just sort of a case of knowing your audience and the game state. If I was town, I wouldn't have held it against you, probably just scolded you if it didn't work out. You took a lot of risks, but that's what a gambit is and it payed off here. You made it more difficult for the scum team. That said, just because you can argue that it got results, the probability of it working out favorably for the town or not, depended on a lot of uncertain/unknowable factors. If Garruk was town, and the role set up wasn't as it was, you could've made it worse for the town later. I think, due to the combination of apathy/unique playerlist (with somewhat unconventional playstyles), it was relatively safe to pull that here, since players would have difficulty criticizing or moralizing into deciding on a moral/policy lynch. I sort of like safer gambits where you have more information to work with, I don't really see why/where you were going to be lynched and am blanking on that account. Maybe explaining your reasoning would help here? Regardless, I don't dislike your playstyle or gambits, unless they're just straight up proven to have 0 chance of improving the odds in your team's favor. And unless I'm mistaken you pretty much pressured people with it, so you were trying to be pro town with it (and succeeded in this case).<br><br>I don't really see the Gaiden hate. He had some ideas and tried in his own way. I can't really point to anything that made me/windblown/DV obvious scum.<br>Besides my inactivity(which was more of a life problem and inexperience problem causing me to play it safe), DV's waiting game, and Windblown pushing against Mhork when that ship had sailed.<br><br>Thank you for playing with me everyone, and I'm sorry again for replacing out. If I play another game, I'm going to keep it to 1 game at a time."}
