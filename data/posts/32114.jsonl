Also #464 makes no sense to me. (#471 is interesting, but do people typically pull doctor claims after a wagon on a PR dissolves due to that PR's claim? This also just dissolves into WIFOM. If we assume that, and then lead a lynch onto another person, who hypothetically is scum, and claims VT instead of something like doctor, we would see them as more town for not trying to claim doctor and out the real doctor through counter claim? What if we get a vote on the real doctor and scum fakeclaims? Actually I'll just stop here cause I'm pretty confused at this point.)

{"number": 902, "id": "5478343", "user": "I Am Innocent", "user_id": "12950", "content": "My thoughts:<br>\n<br>\n1) I am rereading the game, and recording votes. The lack of vote counts (and correctness of them by the mod) is prompting me to want to do so. I will let you know what I find as I go through.<br>\n<br>\n2) I still feel strongly that RC (D1) and Lord Mhork and Marquis (D2) are absolutely town. Anyone that has a scum read on any of these should reread those days and watch their interactions with Garruk and see if they still agree or not and declare that in thread.<br>\n<br>\n3) RC, I too was wary of fuzzy. But not of you and know that your role is one that could be a game changer late game and one that mafia won't want to keep around. So if fuzzy was town, I wanted to force scum's hand to kill him last night and get one less questionable player off the table. Two players attacked me for that in D2 twilight (JKLM and windblown?), but it was the right move. I would love them to explain how it wasn't.<br>\n<br>\n4) Prior to my reread, my scum reads with fuzzy dead still fall in {redtail, windblown, and JKLM}. Salmonella is another that is one I am second guessing and keeping an eye on during my reread.<br>\n<br>\n5) I don't think Gaiden is scum, but not because of my original \"conftown\" reason that his predecessor wanted to be a replace in. Someone produced another game where someone did the exact same thing, and it wasn't the request itself, but the mod reaction that sold me. But Cheery's reaction in that other game was very similar to notscience's in this game, so scratch that. But his vote hopping isn't coming off to me as scummy, it is usually the quiet ones you who don't take too many stances early that you have to watch out for.<br>\n<br>\n6) We now are 99.9% confident that Brian died N1 due to hiding behind scum Garruk. That means one of three things happened: a) scum did not try to kill someone N1, b) they tried to target someone and we have a power role that prevented that c) or they targeted Brian. Putting pcts to it, \"a\" has almost 0 chance, \"b\" has little chance, so it is likely \"c\". With that in mind, read my question and redtail's initial answer to it from D2. He seemed convinced that Brian died initially because scum targeted him. His answer felt like a well crafted scum response, up to and including the usually included \"I probably would have made a similar choice in their position, regardless of those players' reads\" statement. The fact he seemed so certain Brian was targeted by scum could be a scum slip.<br>\n<br>\n7) So yes, I would likely be voting redtail had I not wanted to do this reread first. But we have time, so I ask for a few days. In the meantime, the three people that voted me or suspect me, I'd like to hear your reasons. Esp why D2 I got to asking questions about why Brian died rather than \"help my teammate Garruk by voting Mork\" who was probably around L-2 at that point. I'd like to hear your reasoning on that, as well as based on #6 above, why IAI's team would have targeted Brian N1 when Brian and I were town reading each other. Point being, you can't explain things, so I want to see where your cases lie, and which of you are scum with no real case, but just looking for a low poster to attack.", "time": "Sat Nov 23, 2013 1:04 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=32114&start=900", "forum": "53", "thread": "32114"}

With one NK, why not throw out the case that Brian was scared to use his hider ability and was the victim of a NK rather than throw a case on Mhork that Brian hid behind Mhork. If Garruk knew there were crumbs out there that would ultimately be his downfall, why set town down that path to look for them (as Marquis eventually did).<br>\n<br>\nSmart \"caught\" Garruk play would then be to diffuse the hider ability and go in a different direction (brian didn't likely use the hider ability N1) rather than push Mhork's slot.<br>\n<br>\nI plan on looking at that closer during my reread, but that is my thoughts to this point.", "time": "Thu Nov 28, 2013 4:57 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=32114&start=925", "forum": "53", "thread": "32114"}

(Saw the post where Garruk said he was 60% sure what it was, don't know if that was bull or not).<br>\n<br>\n2) I think it is likely one of Garruk's teammates joined the quick wagon day 2 that got Mhork to L-2. Which points to one of Gaiden, SD, redtail.<br>\n<br>\n3) Looking back at 504, which was Garruk's read list, I still think at least one scum was in the lean town group of 4. Knowing I am town and suspecting Mhork is too, that leaves one of Wake/Windblown. Which probably means one of Red Tail/SD are the other (due to process of elimination, also lines up nicely with #2 above). See my post 903 for more specifics.<br>\n<br>\n4) The quick marquis wagon D1 likely had at least 1 scum on it, which points unfavorably to SD and JKLM (see my posts 904/905 for more details).<br>\n<br>\n5) Garruk choosing the fuzzy wagon over the larger marquis wagon D1, makes me wonder if he was distancing from other scum on the marquis wagon. Points unfavorably at JKLM, and likely does not make both SD and windblown the last 2 scum (see my post 925 for details).<br>\n<br>\nNo longer leaning towards windblown as much.

Which is the only thing you can point at, because Fuzzy died. Not some other random player, but fuzzy, who at least 2 of us (RC and myself) still did not trust up until his flip.

Shifts stance from being ^3's official interpretor to going along with his scum read to vote ^3, because something in Mhork's last post sounded persuasive. Later attaches the string that if ^3 flips scum he will read Mhork as town.<br>\n<br>\n2. Admittedly, my second accusation that he tried to control the interpretation, comes with this post where he expresses doubt about the Mhork wagon.  The whole stream of events bugs me. The first that is to be investigated was Brian's post to look for any hints as to who he hid behind. Garruk knew it and tried to speed the day along, hence the 'unnaturally' fast wagon. Right after this post Garruk just stops right by to clarify and Redtail votes Mhork.  <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_shifty.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":shifty:\" title=\"Shifty-Eyed\">    <br>\n<br>\n3.

Don't worry, I'll go point by point in a second.<br>\n<br>\nFrom the very beginning I've had a strong suspicion of Mhork; that's why I voted him for almost all of D1.  As time went on, I became fairly certain that my tunnel vision was preventing me from actually seeing anything.  Was I so focused on Mhork-scum (for what I still maintain were strong reasons at that point in the game) that I was missing actual scumminess from other players?  Plus, nobody else was jumping onto my wagon with me (okay, a few did, but it was never a serious contender).  What was I missing.<br>\n<br>\nThat's why I wanted so badly to jump on Mhork D2 (which would clearly have been a mistake).  That's why I'm trying to hold IAmInnocent back from declaring Mhork clearly town.  That's why I tried near the end of D1, when I realized that my desired lynch wasn't going to go through, to listen to logic.  I tried to read Mhork's case as if it had come from an unnamed person, and it did make an impression on me.  That's why I agreed to vote ^3 (also, time was kind of a factor there).<br>\n<br>\nRegards post 3: Yeah, that's a clear case of IIoA.  No question.

I'm trying to argue with him about letting Empking float by. I've left people on their own, thinking that they should just think what they want, even if I disagree. But Nacho told me that sometimes people aren't going to see what you see and you need to argue and jostle them.

With their buddy on the outs, scum are in a very uncomfortable position and would be paying close attention to what they say here. JKLM, however, seems to be posting what he's thinking as he thinks it, with very little attention paid to how he sounds (which is actually pretty terrible from a scum perspective.)

It should be obvious that replacing out is better than staying in and not caring about the game, especially if the mod is ns or whatever other reasons he uses for staying in. Obviously if he's scum putting on the apathetic front, or even if he is apathetic scum but is not getting lynched (and therefore doing well as scum) then there is no reason to replace out. It's only when he's actually pressured to do so that he replaces out, despite making a big deal about how he doesn't care about the game to the point where it's over the top.<br>\n<br>\nI struggle to find much that's alignment-relevant from Empking's posts. <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\"><br>\n<br>\nEmpking, why is Lord Mhork town?<br>\n<br>\n~~<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Dorcas/Gaiden</div><br>\n<br>\nDespite the other game, I still think that <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5392314#p5392314\">221</a> is pretty town. The 'I replace the next guy' line really doesn't make sense from Dorcas if he's scum, because that would have obvious implications, and he seems so genuine about wanting to get back in that it can't be a cheeky act to make his slot look more town.
