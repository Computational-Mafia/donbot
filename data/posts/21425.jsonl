Scum masquerades as town; it would be in scum's best interest to act like town and make serious votes on people instead of only making jokes about them. You made a serious vote. If you are town, that is because you felt your vote was at least partially justified and/or felt your vote had at least some purpose there. If you are scum, that means you are trying to skate by as town by hopping on a wagon or trying to look like you're scumhunting etc. The fact that you could not provide anything to back up the serious part of your vote indicates it is more likely you are scum than town.<br>\n<br>\nIn mafia games, scum don't lie back and never vote and never appear to be scumhunting, so unless I'm misunderstanding your argument, it's a flimsy one.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>DCL wrote:</cite><br>\nSecondly, you claimed that is was suspicious that I voted for an \"easy target.\" Are you saying it is wrong to call out lurkers?

What I'm interested in is what specifically makes this a scumtell. I would be totally with you if this were later in the day when wagons actually have some drive to lynch. But I think its worth pointing out that the vote was placed on page two. You can't seriously argue that he was trying to prevent his own lynch or any of that nonsense. It seems a lot more to me like DCL wasn't even thinking about the vote count when he voted, and he put the semi-serious because he was, well, semi-serious. It was more than a dice roll, but less than a solid reason for suspicion. <br>\n<br>\nMy question to you is what specifically about what he did hints at scum motivation?

His general tone and style of language are subtly manipulative; the context in which a discussion is framed by the poster and the way in which that posters language reveals his inner thoughts about his fellows can be just as indicative, even in a limited textual form, as the out and out arguments of said poster.

Her playstyle (is it just me, or am I the only one whose referred to her as a she?) reminds me quite distinctly of Fionnabhair and Kikuchiyo, two players who turned out to be calculating scum in previous games of mine, one Newbie 1176 (my and and I believe her first).

Past experience has shown me that it is a bad idea to string someone up based on bloodthirstiness, and this is experience from both sides of the aisle. His reaction seems far more genuine and townish- the sense of a townie who simply wishes to get things moving rather than bog down the town in discussions about his own alignment.

Care to make up your mind?<br>\n<br>\nAlso, I don't see how you are linking expanded reason to mean that my vote was serious.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nTherein lies the misunderstanding. Here is a very simplified version of what has occurred in our argument this game:<br>\n<br>\n1. You made a \"semi-serious\" vote.<br>\n2. Someone (Matias, maybe someone else, I forget who) asked you to expand upon your reasoning for this vote.<br>\n3. You expanded on your reasoning, but the reasoning you gave was weak and sheep-ish.<br>\n4. I accused you of being scummy because you have very weak and sheep-ish reasoning on your vote.<br>\n5. You said your vote was not serious at all.<br>\n6. I said your vote is serious because you gave reasoning for it and expanded on such reasoning. If it was a completely random or completely joke vote, there would be no reasoning to start with. But since you were able to expand on your reasoning - however weak it may have been - clearly such reasoning existed in the first place. Reasoning = serious vote. You gave reasoning; therefore it was a serious vote.<br>\n<br>\nThe fact that the vote was serious and the fact that you gave reasoning are not what make you scummy to me. What makes you scummy is that your reasoning was weak and sheep-ish. I hope I do not have to explain this again.<br>\n<br>\nOne more clarification: when I say \"non-serious vote\", I refer to one that is wholly RVS. For example, my vote on InnocentVillager was a non-serious vote. Alternatively, a non-serious vote could be a joking one. For instance, early in the game I might say I hate usernames that begin with M so I'm going to vote Matias. That would be a joke; there is no actual reasoning there.<br>\n<br>\nA \"serious vote\" is one that has reasoning alongside it. For example, my vote on you is a serious one because I gave reasoning for it; your most recent vote on me is another example because you gave reasoning for that. Your very first vote on me was also serious, because you gave reasoning (\"weird reactions\"). When people asked you about that vote, you expanded on your reasoning. You attempted to explain why I had \"weird reactions\" (how weak your explanation was is a whole other discussion). If it had been a joke vote or an RVS vote, there would have been no possible expansion of reasoning. For instance, I can't possibly expand on my reasoning for voting InnocentVillager; it was a random vote. And I couldn't expand on my theoretical vote on Matias and say I hate the letter M.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>DCL wrote:</cite>In order to defend against your accusations I had to say other stuff</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nNo, this was before my accusations. Someone asked you about your vote on me and what you meant by weird reactions, and you clarified. And before you jump on me, no, for God's sake, I am not saying clarification is scummy. If you still wish to tell me that I'm saying clarification is scummy, reread my post up until now.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Praetyre wrote:</cite>If DCL flips scum, I might take a closer look at their interactions</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nWhy do you think Bristep and DCL might have related alignments?", "time": "Sun Mar 25, 2012 3:35 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=21425&start=100", "forum": "53", "thread": "21425"}

Is there anyone I'm missing? Matias is the one who caught my eye because he came out the strongest and the earliest. The fact that he hinted towards intent to lynch in 35 made it more noteworthy. I initially thought that the vote from Triangle was purely OMGUS, and for that reason a bit suspect. But as the interaction has unfolded its become plain that Triangle has sufficient reason to be pressing DCL. Although I don't like some of the individual accusations he's made. Bristep is my second suspect. I think its pretty clear judging from his responses that he didn't have any reasoning for his vote and wasn't ready to be questioned. Then he gives the stock \"I was voting for reactions\" in 58, which always rubs me the wrong way.

Your switch seemed a little off to me, but I was going on gut at that point and was trying to push the game along.

Your issue seems to be my terminology of \"which should DIE\" on page two, which is really me just trying to nudge the game along. I get a bit aggressive in RVS. That, along with DCL's terrible switch on triangle kind of made the wagon collateral. That's basically it.

I felt Gertrude's post to be opportunistic because her entire case on Matias up until that point had been halfhearted and nonspecific; #59's by now thoroughly dissected \"narrow focus\" schtick being a good example. She only seemed to jump in with that little comment after others began pointing the finger at Matias, and the comment didn't go into detail at all about her own view of Matias, Triangle or DCL, only a little passive-aggressive attempt at character assassination.<br>\n<br>\nHer latest posts have repeated this pattern, and she seems to have dropped her case on Matias now that she's seen there isn't mileage in trying to start a wagon on him.

Some of his points aren't that great and he tends to flip his vote around a lot, but that seems a lot more like inexperienced town now than actual scum.

In this game, there has been a bit of a debate over whether we should be lynching out of only the three neighborizers, or scum-hunting like normal without much regard for the neighborizer information. I was saying that I do not think we should lynch a neighborizer and not consider anyone else because it's possible that all three neighborizers are town, and then that would be a waste of lynches and a loss to town. However, I said that at the same time, we should not be completely disregarding the neighborizer information because although we don't want to LIMIT ourselves to the neighborizers, there's still a decent chance one is scum. My overall point is that we should be scum-hunting as usual, but with the neighborizer information in mind (a medium between the two extremes). <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Scooby wrote:</cite><br>\nWait, why does elias defending prae makes you think he is town?</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nIf Praetyre is town and Elias is scum, then Praetyre, as what was at the time a popular target for a lynch, would have been a pretty easy bandwagon to jump onto.

You were reading the post crash thread, in which we were very very close to LYLO. The original game thread still exists and if you care to look you'll find that I did shoot down shitty wagons. At least one that I can think of without even having to look (it was on Bub, who turned out to be a town-aligned mason).<br>\n<br>\n<div align=\"center\"><hr style=\"height:14px;width:100%\"></div><br>\n@Farside - It will take me time to write out cases, if thats what you want. My top suspects is RedFF and Scooby. Matias and CC are next on the list but there's not much solid on them.  <br>\n<br>\nRedFF has done exactly what I expected him to when I asked him why Triangle is scum. He went, \"uh, der, I always thought he was scum!\". Sorry, but his original reason for suspecting Triangle was his attacks on DCL, yet Red himself votes DCL in that post. Then when I asked for clarification about why DCL's attack was scummy, he gave me nothing. I find when people claim to be suspecting someone for a long time without ever giving a sufficient reason for the suspicion its because they don't have a reason. Nor a genuine suspicion. Note his response to WHY WHY WHY WHY WHY is still \"I suspected him all game\" and no inkling of a \"why\". I also don't buy the claim, because the timing doesn't make sense.<br>\n<br>\nI am unfamiliar with Scooby's playstyle, but that misrep was not okay. I don't get how you're okay with him blatantly portraying Triangle's posting in a negative light to make him appear scummy. His attacks on me have been mostly logical fallacies, but the fact that they're consistently poor makes me think he's just a bad player. Which makes me think its more likely scumscooby would openly misrepresent as he did. I'm not sure how its scummy that I thought this misrep was bad on day one...it was day one and the other wagons were clearly shit.<br>\n<br>\nCaptain Corporal is just the next scummiest jump onto the wagon but I have no reason to consider him scum other than the jump. This is why I asked him where this sudden commitment to the lynch came from. He also very quickly abandoned his offer to eat shit if Tri flips town. The fact that he deemed it necessary to even make this comment when it wasn't even -1 irks me quite a bit.  <br>\n<br>\nI get bad vibes from Matias that have continued over from yesterday. This is based on his exaggeration of many of his arguments over Day 1, which I pointed out then.", "time": "Sat Apr 14, 2012 11:11 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=21425&start=450", "forum": "53", "thread": "21425"}

You say that I'm scum but you're hardly even pushing the issue. You aren't trying to convince anyone that I'm scum, you threw your vote on and just sort of didn't say anything else. That's cool and all but it brings me to my 2nd point<br>\n2. You ARE lurking. You're posting when called out or when it's opportune, and that's all. You've done jack shit to scumhunt, and you only seem to attack when necessary, which brings me to my 3rd point<br>\n3. YOU are the one sniping, not me. You're the one who didn't mention me at all until I said I thought you were scum, and only said anything further when Praetyre called you out. Otherwise, you sit there and try to avoid the game. Potshots. Here I am, trying to sort out what's useful discussion and what's not useful discussion, which brings me to my 4th point<br>\n4. Me \"sniping\" is clearly a bullshit argument. I've said my peace on the neighbor situation. I haven't said anything about Elias because I'm still trying to read him. In fact, I have plenty of reads, which brings me to my 5th point<br>\n5. I never \"abandoned\" my triangle read. It's still there. I still think she is scum due to nightkill analysis. I just think the wagon was formed in a strange way with people like scooby on it (he has terrible logic in this game). I also think it's imperative to lynch you now that I'm more certain that you're scum and you have a way of completely avoiding everyone, like you did Day 1 AND most of Day 2, and this brings me to my 6th point<br>\n6. I will look at triangle in the future because the only reason why I believe she is scum is nightkill analysis.<br>\n<br>\nBasically, IS, what I'm trying to say is that you're a giant fucking hypocrite. And I use that term loosely, because I'm NONE of the things you've pointed out. You just made it apparent that it's what YOU'RE doing.<br>\n<br>\nCan we lynch this guy now please? Can we just leave the fucking neighbors alone until scum is forced to pick them off, and put the Elias+triangle+farside discussion to bed and bring it back up tomorrow?", "time": "Sun Apr 15, 2012 7:53 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=21425&start=475", "forum": "53", "thread": "21425"}

I now find DCL to be one of my stronger town reads, and while I still harbor a few weak suspicions on him due to previous actions, The Fool's more recent posts come across as town and so I have a tentative town read on him. Obviously, I'm still suspicious of Internet Stranger.<br>\n<br>\nLooking over the posts leading up to Elias's lynch:<br>\n<br>\nCaptain Corporal: I actually find it unlikely from his actions that he's scum. In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3987244#p3987244\" class=\"postlink\">549</a>, he somewhat questioned Scooby's claim, whereas I would expect mafia to be all over it without asking questions. <br>\n<br>\nDCL: It was his actions here that really cemented my town read of him. He showed a lot of earnest analysis, and definitely came across as town.<br>\n<br>\nInternet Stranger: He displayed his weird hesitation, making sniping comments about Matias and Prae while not actually voting for Elias. At first I just thought the hesitation was odd but not scummy, but after a closer look at his posts towards the end of Day 2, his reluctance to vote is rather suspicious. I've been thinking from the mindset that scum would want to jump on an easy lynch like this if they think the person about to be hanged is town, but it's also possible that scum would want to distance themselves from the lynch by not voting. This makes more sense, especially since he hasn't showed much of a reluctance to vote earlier on in the game or even now at the start of the day.<br>\n<br>\nMatias: I find his reaction here to also be very town because he actively protested the Elias lynch. While I can possibly see some players as scum wanting to distance themselves from the lynch (like IS), I don't see why mafia would want to push this hard to prevent the wagon.<br>\n<br>\nPraetyre: Like Matias, he also protested the lynch and refused to vote, which makes him a bit townier in my eyes. A question for Praetyre, though: in light of the Elias wagon, who are your top suspects now?<br>\n<br>\nredFF: His reaction is null, since all he did was vote Elias.<br>\n<br>\nPre-Post Edit: DCL, I was unfamiliar with the role of traitor so I went to the Wiki and skimmed the article.

The wiki says that the traitor role is normal, but there is no standard way to have him appear. <br>\n<br>\n2. The wiki seems to imply that mafia will only know the traitors name if the traitor is a spy. However the wiki also mentions that the traitor is the newer form of the spy, couple that information with the fact that the role is not standardized means that there is no way to know for certain that mafia did/or did not know who the traitor was.<br>\n<br>\nSo basically the option for the mafia to know the traitor is still open. However, even if it is impossible for mafia to know the name of the traitor, triangle's claim about the mafia is still bad.<br>\n<br>\n3. Mafia can either know there is a traitor, or not know there is a traitor, both options are explicitly stated by the wiki.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nSo basically that leaves us with two scenarios.<br>\n<br>\nMafia knew they had a traitor:therefor after the cop claim they would have known elias was a traitor.<br>\nMafia did not know they had a traitor:therefor after the cop claim they could have thought scooby was fake-claiming.<br>\n<br>\nWhen triangle expressed that mafia did not know that elias was scum. He was expressing what is likely inside information. As two completely valid circumstances remain.<br>\n<br>\n For me, even though I am a newer player, when I saw traitor and looked it up the immediate response I had was being annoyed because there are so many possibilities with the traitor that it is basically impossible to try and judge anything out of elias' interactions because we don't know what level of information was available to both the traitor and the scum.<br>\n<br>\nInstead of seeing a situation with a lot of possibilities, triangle immediately focus' on one of them. <br>\n<br>\nConclusion:<br>\n<br>\n-The wiki is not clear about the traitor role, there is the potential for mafia to know the name of their traitor.<br>\n-Even if that option is not possible, mafia still can either know, or not know, that they have a traitor.

The reason for that is because the the wiki clearly states the possibility of scum either knowing, or not knowing whether or not they had a traitor.<br>\n<br>\nLet's think about the scooby claim situation from two perspectives: 1. the scum know they have a traitor, 2. scum do not know they have a traitor.<br>\n<br>\n1. If mafia know they have a traitor they would be trying to find him, its not something they would forget. So if a cop claims a guilty on someone who is not on their scumteam. They would pretty much know that that person was scum. So if scum knew they had a traitor, they would have known elias was the traitor after scooby's accusation. (because at the time a fake claim did not make  a lot of sense)<br>\n<br>\n2. If mafia did not know they had a traitor, then they would have known<br>\n<br>\nWhat we have here are two completely valid options for the traitor role.
