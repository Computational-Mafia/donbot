Sorry about this major delay but yesterday was pretty busy and tonight is gonna be pretty busy too. but I do have like 6-7 hours free so better start despite not having a comfortable amount of sleep.<br>\n<br>\nHi all, For those who have played with me before feel free to skip the rest of this post its my usual post. For those who havn't played with me before Its important you read this post.<br>\n<br>\nFirst thing to note; from this point on I'm going to call mafia red and town Green when ever I can. This is because I don't feel comfortable calling mafia players scum or scummy as its kinda insulting for getting essentially a random role. We all get mafia sometime and I feel we shouldn't insult people for being so. Which is why I started using colours.<br>\n<br>\nOkay so I'm Naomi and I kinda have my own play style. Unlike most people I do worry about myself dying as both alignments as I don't like sitting out. This can lead me to take actions that are normally more  Red aligned as Green. Things such as LAMIST actions are pretty common. I balance this by being entirely open with my posts and playing with my cards face up as much as possible and only lying when setting up a trap, which I try to limit to a minimum. I also find it harder and harder to get reads if a lot of things are focused on myself as I like to review interactions between others to determine alignment and I'm not able to judge using myself and it kinda skews my perception if I'm constantly assaulted. I also will be defensive if attacked until I feel convinced that I can't convince the attacker that I'm Green. I love discussion and will always answer questions put to me though (But sometimes I forget or miss it so you may have to ask again). If I noticed that someone is reaction baiting myself I will answer the question but also provide a over the top response. Other than all of this I do like to give read lists on day 1 but I kinda stop later in the game in favour of a POE list. <br>\n<br>\nI also have a strange play style as Green as I like to seek the people I think are more likely to be Green. This is because as Green people generally are not trying to look green and just being themselves so its easier to pick up greens. So.. my red hunting comprises of first eliminating those who are likely to be green then focusing on my remaining pool and trying to sort bad play from red play. <br>\n<br>\nFinally; This entire post is NAI. I make this kinda post regardless of alignment. It exists as an informative piece on my unique meta. I tend to make it for my second post in the majority of my games. If you wish to manually explore my meta please feel free to open my wiki where you can see all the games I've been in sorted by alignment.", "time": "Sat Feb 04, 2017 12:11 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=70351&start=75", "forum": "53", "thread": "70351"}

I've read through all pages up until this point, and I do have some general reads. First, I want to say that I deliberately skipped reading Naomi's introduction post the moment I realized what it was. No offense, Naomi, but if you start all of your games that way, I'd very quickly want to avoid playing with you. It's an excuse in advance of scummy behavior; despite it likely being honest, the fact is, if your behavior is scummy regardless of alignment, you're still a detriment to town. Rather than attempting to safeguard your defensiveness from the start&#8212;hoping it serves to keep you in the game longer&#8212;I recommend learning to evolve your play style so as to not appear scummy, regardless of alignment. The \"Green\" vs. \"Red\" clarification is helpful, though, so thank you for that.<br>\n<br>\nFro99er, you certainly have an abrasive play style. Not something I appreciate, but likely something I can get use to. Voiding your posts of connotations, I generally agree with your sentiments, up until now at least. You are parroting your defense of comparing Cooperative Sheep to Axel from another game, however, which is coming across as slightly desperate. Despite some pressure coming off of Cooperative Sheep, you still seem very committed to going after them. To confirm, would you like to see Cooperative Sheep lynched today?<br>\n<br>\nCooperative Sheep has handled the initial pressure <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">very</div> scrupulously, and at the moment I wouldn't have any issue going through with a D1 lynch on them. Terata's responses throughout have also rubbed me the wrong way, particularly how he appearingly defended Cooperative Sheep in saying, \"It's likely you just handle your defense awkwardly, regardless of alignment.\" Shortly after, though, he joined in on the pressure on Cooperative Sheep, flat-out calling him scum. To me it appears he was attempting to play both sides in the event Cooperative Sheep might have actually been lynched so quickly&#8212;or in the event everyone backed off and he could be seen as one who wasn't as aggressive in an uncertain lynch.<br>\n<br>\nGerryoat's posts up until now have been primarily filler.<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8811975#p8811975\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8811975#p8811975\" data-post-id=\"8811975\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 20</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=28282\">gerryoat</a> wrote:</cite>I hardclaim town.</div></blockquote>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8811976#p8811976\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8811976#p8811976\" data-post-id=\"8811976\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 21</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=28282\">gerryoat</a> wrote:</cite>Was hoping to flip scum but alas, we are where we are</div></blockquote>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8812010#p8812010\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8812010#p8812010\" data-post-id=\"8812010\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 30</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=28282\">gerryoat</a> wrote:</cite>R u calling me maf</div></blockquote>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8812263#p8812263\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8812263#p8812263\" data-post-id=\"8812263\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 49</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=28282\">gerryoat</a> wrote:</cite>someone else vote so i can activate my 1 shot triple vote</div></blockquote>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8813096#p8813096\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8813096#p8813096\" data-post-id=\"8813096\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 58</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=28282\">gerryoat</a> wrote:</cite>I hardclaimed town.

But what's a bit weird to me is you're saying, \"Why wouldn't I share these thoughts, because it will help your own reads?\" But you admittedly don't know these players and deliberately make it known by saying, \"I don't know how they play, but...\" You did the same with Fro99er here:<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8815547#p8815547\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8815547#p8815547\" data-post-id=\"8815547\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 202</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=29388\">Terata</a> wrote:</cite>Frog being dismissive and non-caring and then having this quick turn.

Then not only that you continue to ask questions regarding your assumption as true rather than consider you made an assumption and your logic is flawed!<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8814266#p8814266\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8814266#p8814266\" data-post-id=\"8814266\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 107</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=29380\">Cooperative Sheep</a> wrote:</cite>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8813063#p8813063\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8813063#p8813063\" data-post-id=\"8813063\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 55</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=25634\">Fro99er</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8813059#p8813059\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8813059#p8813059\" data-post-id=\"8813059\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 54</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=7127\">ChaosOmega</a> wrote:</cite><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: WhemeStar</span><br>\n<br>\nWheme, what are your thoughts on Sheep and the quick L-2 wagon on him?</div></blockquote>\nWhy not give your thoughts?</div></blockquote>\nSpeaking of - I'd like you to respond to my questions.<br>\n<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8812488#p8812488\" class=\"postlink\">http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.ph ... 8#p8812488</a><br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8813631#p8813631\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8813631#p8813631\" data-post-id=\"8813631\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 75</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=29094\">Hawk</a> wrote:</cite>Where/are you that confident that Sheep is scum???

Thanks for answering my question. I may have been hopped up on cold meds last night but I didn't think the case on sheep was that strong so I didn't mind switching my vote to get some response and shake up some people.<br>\n<br>\n Tho personally I don't see what's so scummy as jumping off a wagon and onto another to get some engagement and conversation. It's d1. And early too. I want lots of people talking today not just tunnel on sheep :/<br>\n<br>\nAlso why Gerry? If you thought Sheep's slip was something substantial wouldn't that mean you're inclined to town read Gerry since he was implying that Gerry is town?<br>\n<br>\nPedit: ^ What Fro99er said. Though Im still only partially sold on it being a legit slip. I can easily see this as being a misnomer. Sheep's reaction to the whole thing seems pretty indifferent he's not trying to hard to deny it as a slip more so just saying it's silly to think of it as a slip.</div></blockquote>\n\nI thought it was but after a reread I don't trust Gerry and his recent posts make me think he's scum. Just because you agree with someone doesn't mean you think they're town. I know people won't follow me on to him because Sheep is basically telling himself but that's fine. We can get Gerry tomorrow or even now to put me at ease if the rest of you are town reading him. <br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: </span><br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Sheep</span>", "time": "Sat Feb 04, 2017 1:49 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=70351&start=225", "forum": "53", "thread": "70351"}

So i take that into account, even though i don't really agree with your thought that him being in daychat would change his play very much. Players doesn't usually use daychat THAT much even though it's very good to do so. Though maybe it's different on this site and people post everything through there, but i don't see Sheep doing that.

I also don't like this assumption because it implies not only he should be trusted but the people on the wagon should've been as well. <br>\n</div><br>\nHis <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8812019#p8812019\">33</a> where he essentially calls Frog's argument about the intent of his questions towards Lowell trivial with his avatar retort. <br>\n<br>\nIn his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8814443#p8814443\">113</a>, he discredits Naomi's null read on him by calling it white knighting. If you all go back and read the post of Naomi's he linked, she isn't defending him, she's questioning Gerry based on what she thinks Sheep meant and how Sheep reacted to the accusation. Naomi is not coming to his aid here, she's inquiring whether or not Gerry and Hawk are joking about the basis of their push on Sheep.<br>\n<br>\nHe says he wants to talk with Frog I'm assuming to clarify whatever issues he's still having him but rather than giving him the chance to hear him, he immediately casts a vote for Frog in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8815312#p8815312\">158</a>. Strongly points to me like he already thinks Frog is scum and is just going to continue to provoke him in order to unnecessarily justify his vote.<br>\n<br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8815704#p8815704\">223</a> he just jumps on the Hawk wagon after it's clear he's not really null or town reading Frog or even AJ.</div></blockquote>\n\nthanks!<br>\n<br>\ni think the reasoning is pretty towny toom especially the bolded part connected to your own feelings that you felt at the time he mentioned it.", "time": "Sun Feb 05, 2017 7:14 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=70351&start=300", "forum": "53", "thread": "70351"}

It just doesn't read that way to me. The Pepto one you're referring to from Mafiaception was blatant. He voted a big wagon stressing a bunch of caution, got called on his weakness, and responded he doesn't want a mislynch. Definition of a slip. The Sheep slip is just parsing something a certain way. I read it as \"Oh, you're confirmed town? Well, your highness, you should place a vote so the rest of the town can follow you.\" It's not similar to the Pepto one at all to me, at least.<br>\n<br>\n------<br>\n<br>\nWhemeStar:\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8813184#p8813184\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8813184#p8813184\" data-post-id=\"8813184\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 63</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=29290\">WhemeStar</a> wrote:</cite>I think the push on sheep is weak, and frog made it seem like it was strong to get reactions out of everyone</div></blockquote>\nSo this has been proven wrong. frogger believes the strength of his push on Sheep.

All of his posts are either subtle attempts to derail the sheep wagon or him asking \"hey I wonder what player X think of the sheep wagon?\" His entire game so far seems to exist only to make sure sheep isn't killed... without it appearing as so. This is protecting a scumbuddy or WKing a town to pocket him (I'm leaning the former), but either way chaos is certainly scum.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">fos hawk</div><br>\nThe way he talks in 65 and 75 he takes as given that sheep is not scum and the wagon on him was serving some other purpose than to lynch scum.  But why? I notice he's not the only one to do this (Naomi does as well), but the fact that he doesn't even consider the leading wagon could be scum (or is even serious) reads like he already knows the answer.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">fos naomi</div><br>\nMaybe someone is going to jump in and tell me there's a meta I'm missing, but to post so many times and not have any scumreads is just bad.

As a rule I'm very, very skeptical of \"that guy who everyone townreads.\"  Frogger is no exception.

I read him as very scum at the start and less so as I read on, largely due to the associative things happening around him. He starting to feel less like obvscum and more like opportunistic target.

I hate walls for the most part, so this makes me a \"giant fucking hypocrite\" (remember that phrase)<br>\n<br>\nThere's several problems I have with Chaos' play so far. Some are more meta-based, but some are more evidence based in this game.<br>\n<br>\nChaos opens up in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8813059#p8813059\">54</a> voting Wheme, and asking him what he thinks about my pressure on sheep. It strikes me as odd. Why specifically ask Wheme, and why specifically about my pressure on sheep? I get that my pressure on sheep was the big thing happening at the time, but chaos doesn't give his own thoughts on it because, as he replies to me in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8813126#p8813126\">59</a> \"I don't think they'd be super helpful.\" Yet he expects Wheme's thoughts to be super helpful or something?<br>\n<br>\nAlso, Chaos mentions he's not about the sheep wagon, but does not state why. It's an attempt to disrail the wagon without having to put in the work of doing so.<br>\n<br>\nIn 59, chaos continues \n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>So, frog is town for the push on Sheep. This would lead me to think that you think his reasoning is good/genuine/some other good words. If this is the case, why be suspicious of other people agreeing and why townread Sheep? If this is not the case, why townread frogger?</div></blockquote>\nHe pressures Wheme about why wheme is suspicious of people sheeping me on sheep, the townread on sheep, and the townread on me, as if it's some sort of contradiction. But Wheme actually replies in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8813184#p8813184\">63</a> <blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I think the push on sheep is weak, and frog made it seem like it was strong to get reactions out of everyone</div></blockquote>\n\nThat's a fair response, and jives with how he could see both sheep and myself as town, yet suspect others on the sheep wagon.<br>\n<br>\nBut here's where chaos gets manipulative. In post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8814327#p8814327\">109</a> Chaos asks me for my take on my own push on Sheep. Chaos has played with me twice before, once in my perfect scum win in BEES, and once in our perfect town win in MAFIACEPTION. So he knows I don't fuck around with my pushes. So I give my take that I'm serious about my push (which Chaos knew from meta, and if he's scum he also knows I'm town making a genuine push).<br>\n<br>\n(I'll have more to say about 109 in a minute, but I want to continue on this line of thought around Wheme)<br>\n<br>\nIn <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8818261#p8818261\">282</a> Chaos says <blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I assumed your push was genuine, and it seems like I was right.</div></blockquote> He confirms he knew that my push was genuine, so this is clearly an attempt to turn this around on either Wheme or myself, which he does later in the same post <blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>So this (wheme's post 63) has been proven wrong. frogger believes the strength of his push on Sheep. Since you think the push is weak, does this change your read of frogger at all?</div></blockquote> This is manipulative because if Wheme answers \"yes, my read has changed so now I read frog as scum\" or if wheme answers \"No\" then Chaos can come back with \"then your original reason for townreading frogger for a weak push on sheep was a lie, because you townread him anyway\". Manipulative as hell. It pushes the suspicion elsewhere, while chaos doesn't actually do any work around the sheep wagon himself.<br>\n<br>\nHere's where I come back to chaos' post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8814327#p8814327\">109</a>. He answer's Naomi's question to him with a combo of 1 and 3, meaning a combo of \"I don't think sheep slipped\" and \"I don't have strong feelings on sheep.\" My issue is he's expecting everyone else to have feelings around myself and sheep, yet he can't provide any himself. He just want to create Chaos (pun intended) around the sheep/frog thing, while sidelining what he thinks of me and sheep himself.<br>\n<br>\nThere's also the \"slip\" stuff which Gerry pointed out and I agreed with, and Chaos actively defended against. That was a second,more indirect attempt at derailing the sheep wagon. We disagree about the slip, and this argument won't get us anywhere, but I don't believe this gels with my meta of Chaos using the slip in MAFIACEPTION, even if he says its different. I was town there, and I'm town here, and I still like to push possible slips when I see its possible there was one.

Some are more meta-based, but some are more evidence based in this game.<br>\n<br>\nChaos opens up in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8813059#p8813059\">54</a> voting Wheme, and asking him what he thinks about my pressure on sheep. It strikes me as odd. Why specifically ask Wheme, and why specifically about my pressure on sheep? I get that my pressure on sheep was the big thing happening at the time, but chaos doesn't give his own thoughts on it because, as he replies to me in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8813126#p8813126\">59</a> \"I don't think they'd be super helpful.\" Yet he expects Wheme's thoughts to be super helpful or something?<br>\n<br>\nAlso, Chaos mentions he's not about the sheep wagon, but does not state why. It's an attempt to disrail the wagon without having to put in the work of doing so.<br>\n<br>\nIn 59, chaos continues \n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>So, frog is town for the push on Sheep.

But Wheme actually replies in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8813184#p8813184\">63</a> <blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I think the push on sheep is weak, and frog made it seem like it was strong to get reactions out of everyone</div></blockquote>\n\nThat's a fair response, and jives with how he could see both sheep and myself as town, yet suspect others on the sheep wagon.<br>\n<br>\nBut here's where chaos gets manipulative. In post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8814327#p8814327\">109</a> Chaos asks me for my take on my own push on Sheep. Chaos has played with me twice before, once in my perfect scum win in BEES, and once in our perfect town win in MAFIACEPTION. So he knows I don't fuck around with my pushes. So I give my take that I'm serious about my push (which Chaos knew from meta, and if he's scum he also knows I'm town making a genuine push).<br>\n<br>\n(I'll have more to say about 109 in a minute, but I want to continue on this line of thought around Wheme)<br>\n<br>\nIn <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8818261#p8818261\">282</a> Chaos says <blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I assumed your push was genuine, and it seems like I was right.</div></blockquote> He confirms he knew that my push was genuine, so this is clearly an attempt to turn this around on either Wheme or myself, which he does later in the same post <blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>So this (wheme's post 63) has been proven wrong. frogger believes the strength of his push on Sheep. Since you think the push is weak, does this change your read of frogger at all?</div></blockquote> This is manipulative because if Wheme answers \"yes, my read has changed so now I read frog as scum\" or if wheme answers \"No\" then Chaos can come back with \"then your original reason for townreading frogger for a weak push on sheep was a lie, because you townread him anyway\". Manipulative as hell. It pushes the suspicion elsewhere, while chaos doesn't actually do any work around the sheep wagon himself.<br>\n<br>\nHere's where I come back to chaos' post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8814327#p8814327\">109</a>. He answer's Naomi's question to him with a combo of 1 and 3, meaning a combo of \"I don't think sheep slipped\" and \"I don't have strong feelings on sheep.\" My issue is he's expecting everyone else to have feelings around myself and sheep, yet he can't provide any himself. He just want to create Chaos (pun intended) around the sheep/frog thing, while sidelining what he thinks of me and sheep himself.<br>\n<br>\nThere's also the \"slip\" stuff which Gerry pointed out and I agreed with, and Chaos actively defended against. That was a second,more indirect attempt at derailing the sheep wagon. We disagree about the slip, and this argument won't get us anywhere, but I don't believe this gels with my meta of Chaos using the slip in MAFIACEPTION, even if he says its different. I was town there, and I'm town here, and I still like to push possible slips when I see its possible there was one.

One way to elumate would be to assign a score or rating system like the one seen here.

Without this step, I could have asked Wheme \"Hey, frogger's push is genuine, so now what do you think\", and he could justifiably go \"How the fuck do you know what frogger's push is supposed to be?\" With you clarifying, I now have evidence of it. Didn't think I'd have to explain that, but here we are.<br>\n<br>\nI don't know why you're painting my question here to Wheme as a dichotomy. Is it to make me look worse? Because I asked, given this information he didn't have before, if his read has changed at all. There's a range of options, and I wanted to see how he would re-evaluate his read given one of his premises was wrong. You made plenty of other posts after the early push on Sheep, it's not as if he has to scumread you if his position changes here. I was more looking for any sort of progression from Wheme's earlier reads, since he looks like he established some early and is fitting his play around those early reads to stay consistent and isn't actually scumhunting.<br>\n<br>\nAnd why do you keep bringing up the fucking Sheep wagon?

I was town there, and I'm town here, and I still like to push possible slips when I see its possible there was one.

But the difference is in their tone. It's going to sound really fucking dumb, but the tone of how chaos did it vs. the tone in which Terata did it is miles apart. Here's the difference:<br>\n<br>\nChaos:\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>So this has been proven wrong. frogger believes the strength of his push on Sheep. Since you think the push is weak, does this change your read of frogger at all?</div></blockquote>\nTerata:\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Wheme, you said early you liked Frog for overblowing the \"weak\" (as you called it) push on Sheep and searching for reactions. Did your read on Frogg change anything when you got to know Frogg's push was geniune and not simply a push for reactions. As you said he's still a townread i would assume no? so did he do something else you liked or did it still deserve a townread from you for pushing something you called \"weak\"?</div></blockquote>\n\nTerata asks hers in a way that uses lighter, less accusatory tone for example \"when you got to know Frogg's push was genuine\" (use of the word genuine), \"As you said he's still a townread i would assume no?\" (benefit of the doubt), \"so did he do something else you liked or did it still deserve a townread from you\" (gives Wheme the option of still townreading me for something else, deserve a townread is a much more engaging tone).<br>\n<br>\nChaos was \"So this has been proven wrong\" (Wheme was wrong), \"does this change your read of frogger at all?\" (comapared to terata's does frog still deserve a townread and maybe are there other reasons)<br>\n<br>\nIDK...it's just tone. I don't really remember Chaos taking this tone in BEES or MAFIACEPTION as town, but that's speculation on my part until I re-read.</div></blockquote>\nYou're right, this does sound really fucking dumb. I asked if it changed his read. It's not manipulative, it's not me fucking cornering him, he established a townread on you partially based on something that was later proven to be false. I want to know with that new information, if anything changed. I'm sorry I didn't fucking say please or give him the benefit of the doubt or use the fucking words you would prefer.

So why is it scummy if I ask it but not scummy if you ask the same question?</div></blockquote>\n\ni don't think the question is scummy  by itself. Does that answer the question?</div></blockquote>\nYes, but then there's another question. Here's your summary of my <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8818261#p8818261\">282</a> where I asked that question:\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>this post reads very scripted/forced to me, and the only time he goes into a little bit of a deeper analysis is when he's comparing something to a past game, which is something that's easy to talk about when you're scum because it's something you believe in and can give your true thoughts on. Also looking for contradictions/unexplained progressions more than i'd like. I think that's sometimes a mafia trait too, because it's a simple thing to look for/push on.<br>\n<br>\nScummiest post of the game thus far to me</div></blockquote>\nSo I was focusing on your criticism that the questions focused on contradictions and unexplained progressions, but that is not by itself enough to make it scummy. That's fair. So I guess the tone here is the clincher. Can you explain how my tone in 282 seems to be scripted or forced, and how when you asked seemingly the same question in 311, your tone was more natural?</div></blockquote>\n\nim not gonna describe my own play since that's pretty pointless but for the problems i had with your post, it was mainly the lack of anything i feel i coming from your gut more than something you could \"think up\" as solving. It's usually mixed in with the reads of players and i felt like you lacked that. I took some examples of things you did that i think lacked that, and that questions was 1 thing, you asking for someone's read without any additional thoughts was one. And then your slightly longer explanation around the older game. I guess i don't have any STRONG problems with your tone in the question more than the lack of things i like surrounding it. Tho when fr099 mentioned it i do agree it looked a bit shady how you asked IF it changed Wheme's read on Fr099 when you knew yourself it didn't change. I would've liked you to mention the \"trap\" before waiting for his answer. Also you lacked content aside from that post i liked, so that strengthened my feeling you lacked any reads you truly believed in.", "time": "Mon Feb 06, 2017 9:04 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=70351&start=425", "forum": "53", "thread": "70351"}

If this is not the case, why townread frogger?</div></blockquote>\nHe pressures Wheme about why wheme is suspicious of people sheeping me on sheep, the townread on sheep, and the townread on me, as if it's some sort of contradiction. But Wheme actually replies in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8813184#p8813184\">63</a> <blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I think the push on sheep is weak, and frog made it seem like it was strong to get reactions out of everyone</div></blockquote>\n\nThat's a fair response, and jives with how he could see both sheep and myself as town, yet suspect others on the sheep wagon.<br>\n<br>\nBut here's where chaos gets manipulative. In post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8814327#p8814327\">109</a> Chaos asks me for my take on my own push on Sheep. Chaos has played with me twice before, once in my perfect scum win in BEES, and once in our perfect town win in MAFIACEPTION. So he knows I don't fuck around with my pushes. So I give my take that I'm serious about my push (which Chaos knew from meta, and if he's scum he also knows I'm town making a genuine push).<br>\n<br>\n(I'll have more to say about 109 in a minute, but I want to continue on this line of thought around Wheme)<br>\n<br>\nIn <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8818261#p8818261\">282</a> Chaos says <blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I assumed your push was genuine, and it seems like I was right.</div></blockquote> He confirms he knew that my push was genuine, so this is clearly an attempt to turn this around on either Wheme or myself, which he does later in the same post <blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>So this (wheme's post 63) has been proven wrong. frogger believes the strength of his push on Sheep. Since you think the push is weak, does this change your read of frogger at all?</div></blockquote> This is manipulative because if Wheme answers \"yes, my read has changed so now I read frog as scum\" or if wheme answers \"No\" then Chaos can come back with \"then your original reason for townreading frogger for a weak push on sheep was a lie, because you townread him anyway\". Manipulative as hell. It pushes the suspicion elsewhere, while chaos doesn't actually do any work around the sheep wagon himself.<br>\n<br>\nHere's where I come back to chaos' post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8814327#p8814327\">109</a>. He answer's Naomi's question to him with a combo of 1 and 3, meaning a combo of \"I don't think sheep slipped\" and \"I don't have strong feelings on sheep.\" My issue is he's expecting everyone else to have feelings around myself and sheep, yet he can't provide any himself. He just want to create Chaos (pun intended) around the sheep/frog thing, while sidelining what he thinks of me and sheep himself.<br>\n<br>\nThere's also the \"slip\" stuff which Gerry pointed out and I agreed with, and Chaos actively defended against. That was a second,more indirect attempt at derailing the sheep wagon. We disagree about the slip, and this argument won't get us anywhere, but I don't believe this gels with my meta of Chaos using the slip in MAFIACEPTION, even if he says its different. I was town there, and I'm town here, and I still like to push possible slips when I see its possible there was one. For chaos to dismiss it so quickly, given what he did in MAFIACEPTION and how easy it was for other scum to dismiss it so quickly, is just another little point.<br>\n<br>\nThe clincher is his post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8822450#p8822450\">341</a> where he accuses Terata of doing the same thing he did around questioning Wheme. Yes, terata did question Wheme, about the exact same thing, and Terata even called Chaos out in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8818351#p8818351\">283</a> for saying Chaos' post where he then pushes back on Wheme now that I've said my push on sheep was real. But the difference is in their tone. It's going to sound really fucking dumb, but the tone of how chaos did it vs. the tone in which Terata did it is miles apart. Here's the difference:<br>\n<br>\nChaos:\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>So this has been proven wrong. frogger believes the strength of his push on Sheep. Since you think the push is weak, does this change your read of frogger at all?</div></blockquote>\nTerata:\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Wheme, you said early you liked Frog for overblowing the \"weak\" (as you called it) push on Sheep and searching for reactions. Did your read on Frogg change anything when you got to know Frogg's push was geniune and not simply a push for reactions. As you said he's still a townread i would assume no? so did he do something else you liked or did it still deserve a townread from you for pushing something you called \"weak\"?</div></blockquote></div></blockquote>\n\nTerata asks hers in a way that uses lighter, less accusatory tone for example \"when you got to know Frogg's push was genuine\" (use of the word genuine), \"As you said he's still a townread i would assume no?\" (benefit of the doubt), \"so did he do something else you liked or did it still deserve a townread from you\" (gives Wheme the option of still townreading me for something else, deserve a townread is a much more engaging tone).<br>\n<br>\nChaos was \"So this has been proven wrong\" (Wheme was wrong), \"does this change your read of frogger at all?\" (comapared to terata's does frog still deserve a townread and maybe are there other reasons)<br>\n<br>\nIDK...it's just tone. I don't really remember Chaos taking this tone in BEES or MAFIACEPTION as town, but that's speculation on my part until I re-read.<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div></div></blockquote></div></div></div>", "time": "Mon Feb 06, 2017 10:22 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=70351&start=425", "forum": "53", "thread": "70351"}

Well it's all the things that pinged me in this post. <br>\nHe seems super apologetic in his wordings which i haven't really seen from his previous play, an example being \"im trying my best to help town\" (talking about town as a seperate entity). I also had a problem with how he tries to take credit for coming up with certain reads that he clearly sheeped from others in the thread. If he said he sheeped them it would be completely fine, but he talks like he thought them up himself. Specifically the one about Lowell slipping about AJ's reads but also a little about the Sheep read, which was summarized with what problems other's have had with Sheep all game (and this is after he read the posts \"over and over\").<br>\n<br>\nHe made sure to point out someone who had done less pro-town things than he has (gerry) which mafia loves to do when they feel they're getting pressure even though there are towns not showing towniness. And he KEPT saying he's having the same null/townread about Gerry which he had for the same reason as earlier that had been called out by BOTH gerry and frogg, who you're still saying pointed out the initial slip. He just won't back down from his initial statement even though it's clearly wrong, and that's much more scummy than being wrong in the first place in this scenario. Also, why would he even say Gerry's been contributing less than he has if he's still null-townreading gerry? Seems like standard shade to me.<br>\n<br>\nLast but not least i dislike in what form he gives his Naomi read. He says it like \"I also think Lowell is wrong on Naomi...\" as to shade Lowell (his scumread) for being wrong on a town, which seems like a tmi read to me if i've ever seen one. That read just doesn't come naturally to you to call Lowell wrong in your case on him if you don't know the alignment of the person being read. And disliked how he phrased \"id like to vote\" at the end. A struggling finish to a scummy post.<br>\n<br>\nThis is what a confident vote looks like <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: WhemeStar</span> !<br>\n<br>\n(Chaos made me doubt since his comeback)", "time": "Mon Feb 06, 2017 11:40 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=70351&start=450", "forum": "53", "thread": "70351"}

On the surface it looks like just filler, but if you look and think it about it on a deeper level, he's arguable treating himself as confirmed town that shouldn't be considered for a lynch today by anyone for getting the game out of RVS as well as starting a wagon on Sheep. <br>\n<br>\nFast forward to a bit to <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8814765#p8814765\">134</a>, he does the same thing again by discrediting not only Naomi's read on him but also her as a player by bringing up a previous game without any context in which he claims he got two members of the scum team lynched.<br>\n<br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8814782#p8814782\">136</a> is self explanatory. <br>\n<br>\nI'm inclined to believe <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8815105#p8815105\">152</a> is more scum motivated than town motivated and it only reinforces my read on him. He's hints at a PR of some sort and says he shouldn't be lynched today. There was no pressure on him at the time and the overall focus was on Sheep as well as the various arguments Frog was getting into so it was odd for him to drop that soft like it's hot and just leave. Scum have more to gain by bread crumbing in my opinion.

The whole frogger-WhemeStar convo from <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8814915#p8814915\">144</a> to <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8815097#p8815097\">151</a> is good to look at. frogger expresses suspicion of Wheme if Sheep flips town, and Wheme seems worried about it in response, asking why in 145 and then nervously trying to figure out what frogger is scumreading him for in 148, and then the pathetic placation in 150. If Wheme was town, why the fuck would he just roll over like that and try to appease frogger as opposed to confronting him? It's like he knows he's guilty, and is just trying to be nice and fade into the background. This exchange is part of the reason I'm not sold on Sheep-scum, since I'm assuming Wheme is scum and his reaction would not have been like that if Sheep was his partner; he would just shut up and take the town-cred on a Sheep lynch.<br>\n<br>\nWheme was townreading Sheep for most of this game from the beginning (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8813065#p8813065\">56</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8819010#p8819010\">307</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8819851#p8819851\">332</a>, etc.).

The whole frogger-WhemeStar convo from 144 to 151 is good to look at. frogger expresses suspicion of Wheme if Sheep flips town, and Wheme seems worried about it in response, asking why in 145 and then nervously trying to figure out what frogger is scumreading him for in 148, and then the pathetic placation in 150. If Wheme was town, why the fuck would he just roll over like that and try to appease frogger as opposed to confronting him? It's like he knows he's guilty, and is just trying to be nice and fade into the background. This exchange is part of the reason I'm not sold on Sheep-scum, since I'm assuming Wheme is scum and his reaction would not have been like that if Sheep was his partner; he would just shut up and take the town-cred on a Sheep lynch.</div><br>\n<br>\nYou know, its really hard to get emotion right over words typed on a screen, because I wasn't nervous at all then. I was just wondering why he would suspect me because its my first normal game and I had no clue on what his reasons were. Yes, I was town reading sheep for the early part of the game, because I thought the slip on him and push on him was weak, but I didn't like his responses over time. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">- Why is Gerry so much higher than Penguin here? Reasoning for each would seem to indicate they'd be next to each other.<br>\n- Look at how he townreads Tereta and EC for pushing him. He doesn't challenge them for being wrong, it's like how he tried to resolve the same issue with frogger, say their play is pro-town and hope they leave him alone.<br>\n- So Lowell is supposedly his biggest scumread, yet the reasoning for it is so lame. It's nothing but a slip that other people had talked about prior.<br>\n</div><br>\nBecause Gerry has been here all game, Penguin was late to the party. <br>\nI said they pushed me and others, which isn't that what a town should do? Push people even if the person their pushing may be town?<br>\nThe slip on Sheep wasn't really a slip either, look where that got us. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">So your opinions aren't your own thoughts?</div><br>\nMy opinions are thoughts of others jumbled into what I like, and what I don't like.

On the surface it looks like just filler, but if you look and think it about it on a deeper level, he's arguable treating himself as confirmed town that shouldn't be considered for a lynch today by anyone for getting the game out of RVS as well as starting a wagon on Sheep. <br>\n<br>\nFast forward to a bit to <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8814765#p8814765\">134</a>, he does the same thing again by discrediting not only Naomi's read on him but also her as a player by bringing up a previous game without any context in which he claims he got two members of the scum team lynched.<br>\n<br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8814782#p8814782\">136</a> is self explanatory. <br>\n<br>\nI'm inclined to believe <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8815105#p8815105\">152</a> is more scum motivated than town motivated and it only reinforces my read on him. He's hints at a PR of some sort and says he shouldn't be lynched today. There was no pressure on him at the time and the overall focus was on Sheep as well as the various arguments Frog was getting into so it was odd for him to drop that soft like it's hot and just leave. Scum have more to gain by bread crumbing in my opinion. It helps them with fake claiming and it can potential draw doctors and jail keepers to them.<br>\n<br>\nTL:DR: Gerry has been been basically treating himself as confirmed town since RVS ended.<br>\n<br>\nI think Gerry tried to distance from Sheep early and it sort of backfired a bit. I also think he could be just scum that tried to spread and pray on paranoia early and Sheep is town. <br>\n<br>\nIf we lynch Gerry today, we'll probably feel a lot better about Sheep's alignment</div></div></div></div></blockquote>\n\nLUV moves up in my townreads to join Fro99er and Naomi.

Note: \"I say that the theory scum plan was to WK (which you did)\" see how he doesn't give a chance to discredit the idea by even beginning to think that Terata was doing anything else. If its apparently he was WK you shouldn't have to clarify because its apparent. If it isn't apparent then its your opinion that the behavior is WK, and not fact, I don't like this tone unless someone is downright denying their behavior was one thing when it could be another, and even then it's kinda scummy behavior to deal in such absolutes this early on.

This in any case means that Sheep is already not playing well as town by his own definition. He doesn't take the time to communicate and discuss whats going on he makes assumptions about about others players play and reads them off of it. (also he entirely focuses on scum slips and things that are scummy which is fine to scum hunt but he has very few town reads from what I can tell and if he does they're very slight and he always is doubly suspicious that it may have alternative motives, Ex: Terata and later Naomi.) <br>\n<br>\nEven here he doesn't take fro99ers admittance of a misunderstanding as anything town but a chance to turn the table and accuse fro99er of scummy behavior.<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8815482#p8815482\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8815482#p8815482\" data-post-id=\"8815482\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 188</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=29380\">Cooperative Sheep</a> wrote:</cite>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8815444#p8815444\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8815444#p8815444\" data-post-id=\"8815444\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 187</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=25634\">Fro99er</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8815414#p8815414\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8815414#p8815414\" data-post-id=\"8815414\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 180</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=29380\">Cooperative Sheep</a> wrote:</cite>@Frogger - The idea that he would never sheep does support A and B cleanly and without effort.</div></blockquote>\n<img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/3oz8xLd9DJq2l2VFtu/giphy.gif\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></div></blockquote>\nWhy not though? <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">If someone will never sheep</div>, which means they never follow anyone elses' thoughts, they aren't cooperating ever.<br>\nSure, reads might align - but they are openly stating zero cooperation unless I'm missing something.</div></blockquote>\n\nMore assumptions.

I don't like any of this, compounded with everything Fro99er and Terata had said at the time about hsi behavior this just adds another layer of assumption to the mix in his logic. This reads to me as Close minded town playing poorly or scum trying to sound absolute about his cases and unwavering.

Sometimes you sheep someone. Especially in RVS. He also says that he never said it had anything to do with whether he may or may not have eventually been comfortable voting there, but your assumption was that if he's not willing to vote because its a sheep then he will be uncooperative which in of itself is a contradiction because if he may or may not eventually be okay with voting there wouldn't that at that point make him *gasp* cooperative? Like you're saying its about cooperation but if your case is built on the assumption that Lowell never sheeps therefor is uncooperative or difficult to cooperate with then your case does matter about him eventually voting one way or the other. Because he in your mind is either never sheeping meaning he has to reach conclusions of his own accord and then vote with town or never reach those conclusions and not vote cooperatively. Your logic deals in so many absolutes that it sucks. Like even if you are town (I don't think you are) your logic sucks balls.<br>\n<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8815610#p8815610\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8815610#p8815610\" data-post-id=\"8815610\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 209</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=29380\">Cooperative Sheep</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8815510#p8815510\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8815510#p8815510\" data-post-id=\"8815510\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 196</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=25634\">Fro99er</a> wrote:</cite>Probably scum for not even attempting to understand my play.

Yeah I know it looks bad because its mine. But also note his tone here. Right before the bolded portion he says fro99ers defense is bad and hypocrisy. Town hypocrisy but hypocrisy non the less. If AJ's points about nitpicky ness are the same as fro99er's then its not just hypocrisy but its justified here? Like you justify fro99ers case and don't deny it but instead decide to say that engaging back in the manner that you are is your only way to sort through it. Like if you understand it's a scummy way to fight back a case then maybe you need to find another way to fix it. And to your defense you do ask for suggestions for future games but to be honest there are a million ways you can engage back with fro99er rather than sit there and just go over in ridiculous detail what fro99er has said and done instead of just presenting yourself or your logic in a manner that answers his questions. Like you never take a second to just let it go you always have to have the FoS shifted in another direction other than your own. Start there. Don't end every response with a question that throws shade back at the attacking player because to town players that seems super scummy and to scummy players they can just play off it and set you up to look worse.<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8823990#p8823990\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8823990#p8823990\" data-post-id=\"8823990\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 436</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=29380\">Cooperative Sheep</a> wrote:</cite>She kind of did the same thing to me, when I did my WK tell - even though I ruled her as town and said the tell didn't apply to her she seemed to get a little aggro about it.<br>\nThen again, I recall Tetara kinda doing the same thing, so seems like a thin scumtell, yeah?<br>\n<br>\nHaving a hard time parsing a lot of the other cases - they mostly seemed to be based on hypocrisy (which I feel has been a cornerstone of every case so far) and I also think a lot of people are mxing up hypocrisy with 'logic I don't understand/don't agree with and don't care to try to' which seems really different to me.<br>\n<br>\nMy scum reads remain about the same, I'll remind people that I've had issues with Chaos for some time now, just in case anyone wants to have a complaint about me hopping on that wagon if it catches much more steam <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\";)\" title=\"Wink\"> But I'm happy with it and Hawk as frontrunners.</div></blockquote>\n\nDidn't see much else bothering me till here.

Well it's all the things that pinged me in this post. <br>\nHe seems super apologetic in his wordings which i haven't really seen from his previous play, an example being \"im trying my best to help town\" (talking about town as a seperate entity). I also had a problem with how he tries to take credit for coming up with certain reads that he clearly sheeped from others in the thread. If he said he sheeped them it would be completely fine, but he talks like he thought them up himself. Specifically the one about Lowell slipping about AJ's reads but also a little about the Sheep read, which was summarized with what problems other's have had with Sheep all game (and this is after he read the posts \"over and over\").<br>\n<br>\nHe made sure to point out someone who had done less pro-town things than he has (gerry) which mafia loves to do when they feel they're getting pressure even though there are towns not showing towniness. And he KEPT saying he's having the same null/townread about Gerry which he had for the same reason as earlier that had been called out by BOTH gerry and frogg, who you're still saying pointed out the initial slip. He just won't back down from his initial statement even though it's clearly wrong, and that's much more scummy than being wrong in the first place in this scenario. Also, why would he even say Gerry's been contributing less than he has if he's still null-townreading gerry? Seems like standard shade to me.<br>\n<br>\nLast but not least i dislike in what form he gives his Naomi read. He says it like \"I also think Lowell is wrong on Naomi...\" as to shade Lowell (his scumread) for being wrong on a town, which seems like a tmi read to me if i've ever seen one. That read just doesn't come naturally to you to call Lowell wrong in your case on him if you don't know the alignment of the person being read. And disliked how he phrased \"id like to vote\" at the end.

On the surface it looks like just filler, but if you look and think it about it on a deeper level, he's arguable treating himself as confirmed town that shouldn't be considered for a lynch today by anyone for getting the game out of RVS as well as starting a wagon on Sheep. <br>\n<br>\nFast forward to a bit to <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8814765#p8814765\">134</a>, he does the same thing again by discrediting not only Naomi's read on him but also her as a player by bringing up a previous game without any context in which he claims he got two members of the scum team lynched.<br>\n<br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8814782#p8814782\">136</a> is self explanatory. <br>\n<br>\nI'm inclined to believe <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8815105#p8815105\">152</a> is more scum motivated than town motivated and it only reinforces my read on him. He's hints at a PR of some sort and says he shouldn't be lynched today. There was no pressure on him at the time and the overall focus was on Sheep as well as the various arguments Frog was getting into so it was odd for him to drop that soft like it's hot and just leave. Scum have more to gain by bread crumbing in my opinion. It helps them with fake claiming and it can potential draw doctors and jail keepers to them.<br>\n<br>\nTL:DR: Gerry has been been basically treating himself as confirmed town since RVS ended.<br>\n<br>\nI think Gerry tried to distance from Sheep early and it sort of backfired a bit. I also think he could be just scum that tried to spread and pray on paranoia early and Sheep is town. <br>\n<br>\nIf we lynch Gerry today, we'll probably feel a lot better about Sheep's alignment</div></div></div></div></blockquote>\n\nLUV moves up in my townreads to join Fro99er and Naomi. Congrats on the promotion.  Unfortunately there is no pay raise associated.</div></blockquote>\n@Penguin, what is wrong with asking to reveal?

But oh well, Ill do it anyway.<br>\n<br>\nIm a <div style=\"display:inline;color:#40BF40\">Town Odd Night Rolestopper. </div>. Sorry if my actions don't seem towny, Im working on it still.</div></blockquote>\n\n*facepalm* this is bad. You've been told why its bad. But I'll explain. If you have a really good feeling about who could be scum and we lynch correctly today your role would prove very useful come N3 if you could make it that long but now you're never making it that far unless you're scum or we have some other god awesome PR's, the claim itself feels forced and awkward and entirely out of characteristic for someone with only a few votes on them. I understand Fro99ys hesitation to believe this. If anything it might have reinforced his vote.<br>\n<br>\nPEDIT: Okay so not lynching you today is not necessarily good? If you're lying about role stopper being town this game town potentially risks you being able to hit one of our actual PR's tonight which isn't likely but still not good if we have a Cop or a Vigi with a good shot or a doc or something. I don't nesscarily want to lynch you because I don't think your play up until now has been too scummy but you have lurked a bit and haven't contributed much.

Say I flounder and don't do well at defending myself and this lynch goes through by the end of the day (I lynch) I flip green we lynch Sheep he flips red oh looky AJ was right. Whew looks bad. Untrained eye might look good but experienced town and scum know this can look very very shady! I don't like that play by him as side from that its a pretty good post.

Well it's all the things that pinged me in this post. <br>\nHe seems super apologetic in his wordings which i haven't really seen from his previous play, an example being \"im trying my best to help town\" (talking about town as a seperate entity). I also had a problem with how he tries to take credit for coming up with certain reads that he clearly sheeped from others in the thread. If he said he sheeped them it would be completely fine, but he talks like he thought them up himself. Specifically the one about Lowell slipping about AJ's reads but also a little about the Sheep read, which was summarized with what problems other's have had with Sheep all game (and this is after he read the posts \"over and over\").<br>\n<br>\nHe made sure to point out someone who had done less pro-town things than he has (gerry) which mafia loves to do when they feel they're getting pressure even though there are towns not showing towniness. And he KEPT saying he's having the same null/townread about Gerry which he had for the same reason as earlier that had been called out by BOTH gerry and frogg, who you're still saying pointed out the initial slip. He just won't back down from his initial statement even though it's clearly wrong, and that's much more scummy than being wrong in the first place in this scenario. Also, why would he even say Gerry's been contributing less than he has if he's still null-townreading gerry? Seems like standard shade to me.<br>\n<br>\nLast but not least i dislike in what form he gives his Naomi read. He says it like \"I also think Lowell is wrong on Naomi...\" as to shade Lowell (his scumread) for being wrong on a town, which seems like a tmi read to me if i've ever seen one. That read just doesn't come naturally to you to call Lowell wrong in your case on him if you don't know the alignment of the person being read. And disliked how he phrased \"id like to vote\" at the end.

On the surface it looks like just filler, but if you look and think it about it on a deeper level, he's arguable treating himself as confirmed town that shouldn't be considered for a lynch today by anyone for getting the game out of RVS as well as starting a wagon on Sheep. <br>\n<br>\nFast forward to a bit to <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8814765#p8814765\">134</a>, he does the same thing again by discrediting not only Naomi's read on him but also her as a player by bringing up a previous game without any context in which he claims he got two members of the scum team lynched.<br>\n<br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8814782#p8814782\">136</a> is self explanatory. <br>\n<br>\nI'm inclined to believe <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8815105#p8815105\">152</a> is more scum motivated than town motivated and it only reinforces my read on him. He's hints at a PR of some sort and says he shouldn't be lynched today. There was no pressure on him at the time and the overall focus was on Sheep as well as the various arguments Frog was getting into so it was odd for him to drop that soft like it's hot and just leave. Scum have more to gain by bread crumbing in my opinion. It helps them with fake claiming and it can potential draw doctors and jail keepers to them.<br>\n<br>\nTL:DR: Gerry has been been basically treating himself as confirmed town since RVS ended.<br>\n<br>\nI think Gerry tried to distance from Sheep early and it sort of backfired a bit. I also think he could be just scum that tried to spread and pray on paranoia early and Sheep is town. <br>\n<br>\nIf we lynch Gerry today, we'll probably feel a lot better about Sheep's alignment</div></div></div></div></blockquote>\n\nLUV moves up in my townreads to join Fro99er and Naomi.

The second is that Lowell's posture after I stated this was to say you're scummy but not as scummy as Sheep (as seen by his vote and only FOS on you). Last, you do have a tendency to defend him subtly, specifically in your case vs sheep when you talk about cooperation and shit. And of course you being really into Wheme being town hasn't been that helpful in dissuading my feelings on this. Lowell won't even give a read on Wheme.<br>\n<br>\nDefinitely can't say that I understand how committal you are on Lowell. To me, he's pretty cut and dry. <br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Lowell</span><br>\n<br>\nI will admit though I'm more confident on him being scum. He's blatantly just going for big wagons. <br>\n<br>\nAlso, Terata's actions recently are suspect. He actually has Gerry down twice in his reads, null and weak town. He's reading Lowell as town... On the same level of his read on me which is unequivocally garbage. And his Chaos read being scum leans is definitely FOTM rather than actual belief. My belief is he's trying to gauge some reads off of other people and is a bit behind on trends. <br>\n<br>\nI want Fro99er to tell me what about Lowell/Terata's vote switches made him comfortable following that. I know you townread Terata but Lowell looks like a freelancer willing to lynch anyone BUT Wheme at this point.<br>\n<br>\nP-edit: Yeah I don't know if terata is out of his league vs ECMitchell or that's just strong town mitchell but Terata's definitely not winning this argument.</div></blockquote>\n\nOkay this makes a lot more sense to me. Looking at the ISO only he didn't seem to bad but you're right if I just go through the actual thread he's pretty oppurtunistic. And while I really dislike Sheep's playstyle and his earlier play that wagon seems to be going nowhere so I can agree more with this.<br>\n<br>\nTerata still seems town to me even if a bit suspect but I'll reserve actual judgment for later. His argument with ECM is pretty weak. Also ECM responded very well to that pressure town points there. <br>\n<br>\nGerry pings me a lot same with Penguin because of how little they've posted.

On the surface it looks like just filler, but if you look and think it about it on a deeper level, he's arguable treating himself as confirmed town that shouldn't be considered for a lynch today by anyone for getting the game out of RVS as well as starting a wagon on Sheep. <br>\n<br>\nFast forward to a bit to <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8814765#p8814765\">134</a>, he does the same thing again by discrediting not only Naomi's read on him but also her as a player by bringing up a previous game without any context in which he claims he got two members of the scum team lynched.<br>\n<br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8814782#p8814782\">136</a> is self explanatory. <br>\n<br>\nI'm inclined to believe <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8815105#p8815105\">152</a> is more scum motivated than town motivated and it only reinforces my read on him. He's hints at a PR of some sort and says he shouldn't be lynched today. There was no pressure on him at the time and the overall focus was on Sheep as well as the various arguments Frog was getting into so it was odd for him to drop that soft like it's hot and just leave. Scum have more to gain by bread crumbing in my opinion. It helps them with fake claiming and it can potential draw doctors and jail keepers to them.<br>\n<br>\nTL:DR: Gerry has been been basically treating himself as confirmed town since RVS ended.<br>\n<br>\nI think Gerry tried to distance from Sheep early and it sort of backfired a bit.

He does describes why tho, but that's not really a slip. While I do agree Sheep was scummy here, Garrybote is scum pushing a \"slip\" that's not actually a \"slip\" Part of the reason why I SR chaos currently is that with 341 (I think that's what the post was) he was looking for a slip to push. Scum like having a justified vote. Garrybote would then push this \"slip\" that isn't actually a slip, and then if Sheep flipped town, Garrybote will then use the justification he built as a scape-goat.<br>\n<br>\n152 is him softing a PR. We'll keep this for later, but right now it's coming across as \"Hey, I'm scum, allow me to soft a PR so that people will be scared to lynch me and I can do fuck all hahahaha\"<br>\n<br>\n333 is him backing off of a \"slip\" he was pushing. He knows what he was pushing was not a \"slip\" The backpedal here is scummy as fuck. He unvotes him but still think's he's scum that wants him lynched? nononono. This is not town behavoir.<br>\n<br>\n535 is him just saying \"You're wrong.\" He doesn't attempt to make a rebuttal, he just discredits it as \"wrong\"<br>\n541 is him just throwing shit out there to make himself look like he's doing things. He's not doing things.<br>\n568 is misrepresentation. Rolestopper's can be townaligned. He's saying \"It's usually a scum role\" so people will go jump on Wheme and get Wheme mislynched.<br>\n<br>\n741 is an even further backpedal from sheep. Went from being a big scumread because they \"slipped\" to \"Eh, they won't get lynched today but they're still scum\" to \"They aren't that scummy?\" Yeah no, their sheep read is fake as fuck.<br>\n<br>\n960 he doesn't even have a TR. More like, he can't fake one! hahahaha! People have been townie. He's just chosing to ignore those slots.<br>\n965 is \"OMGAWD I'M A PR, LET ME SHOVE IT IN YOUR FACE, DON'T LYNCH ME BECAUSE I'M A PR\"<br>\n976 is just him trying to throw more shade at Wheme's claim.<br>\n<br>\n1000 is a really manipulative question. It's basicly suggesting \"If you answer yes, your slot get's descreditted; if you answer no, you're scummy.\" I mean, I asked Garrybote what would a yes answer mean to him and what a no answer would mean to him but he jumped on me instead of anwsering the question? This is scum trying to blatantly be manipulative and get away with it.<br>\n<br>\n1004 is just throwing more words and looks like panicked scum because I caught them.<br>\n<br>\n1005 is him basicly saying \"Eh, I scumread a slot, I'm pretty sure that Alisae replaced the previous slot holder, but I'm too lazy to check.\" If you're too lazy to check then your scumread on them is not in good faith. It's faked and in bad faith.<br>\n<br>\n1017 says \"I'm too lazy to push you\" more like \"My scumread is fake and fabricated and I can't push you without making it look scummy.\" If his scumread on my slot was in good faith and was real he would be pushing me, not halfassing his scumread on me.<br>\n<br>\nOverall Garrybote is manipulative, coasting scum who has no real conviction in his pushes.", "time": "Sun Feb 12, 2017 9:53 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=70351&start=1025", "forum": "53", "thread": "70351"}

One post he says he was flipping the read on a reread based off first RVS posts. When I ask the same question in a different light and ask why he flips his read around (450ish range) he instead cites posts in that range instead of saying ask round that time I reread the ISO.

It buys them longevity, it cuts ties with a mate they feel is a detriment to their team, and in some cases it earns them blind and stupid trust from others for what will probably be long enough for them to win.

It's kind of been on auto-pilot for me since Alisae's fake result.<br>\n<br>\nFor my part I will say this.  If there is a 1v1 situation that early in the game pitting a claimed PR against a VT...I'm going to opt for believing the claim.  Even if the claim was a lie (as it turned out to be)...town was still setting themselves up to be rid of the 2nd mafia member the following day and still in possession of two chances to get the last mafia member.  Those are not bad odds.  I will say in hindsight it might have been better to let D3 last a little longer and grill Alisae about their claim but in my case at least...I can be a bit impatient when my mind is made up.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nwith regards to my current reads:<br>\n<br>\nLowell - Lowell was my alternative to Sheep D1.  I didn't care for Sheep but that wagon was going nowhere so I swapped to Lowell in part for OMGUS retaliation.  Looking back I am doubtful that Sheep would bus Lowell so adamently D1, up to L-2 a few times, without trying to move things elsewhere.  Of my four remaining reads Lowell is probably the one I'm most confident is town based on VCA and counter wagon to Sheep.<br>\n<br>\nTerata is a bit of an enigma in my  mind this game.  Seems like she has had a few stretches where she has been absent.  Also, she hasn't made a vote since D1 so VCA is not that telling on her.  She did initiate the final wagon on Sheep D1...when she could have easily hopped on tbd!me, town!Wheme or tbd!Lowell.  So on what little VCA that does apply to her she appears to be a town lean.<br>\n<br>\nThat leaves me with IAI and Unknown.<br>\n<br>\nIAI replaced ECMitchell who was focused for the bulk of D1 and all D2 on getting rid of Wheme.  ECM never voted otes on Alisae or Sheep.  Alisae however on D2 did vote ECM with conviction (up to L-1).  Not sure if this is a pass for ECM as Alisae was sheeping Frogger heavily during the game and Frogger had just voted ECM prior to Alisae's vote.  But it looks better than if Alisae had totally ignored ECM.<br>\n<br>\nUnknown...replaced LUV mid-D1.  Luv had done some light voting (bussing?) on Sheep D1.  Unknown entered the game and chose to vote me (a negative fmpov) and hammered Sheep.  Hammering scum is good.  Hammering scum when it is a foregone conclusion scum is going to be lynched...not as good.  But at least not bad.  D2..Unknown put the Chaos mislynch wagon at L-2 two posts before Froger hammered.  D3...Unknown chose to ignore Alisae's claim and vote Alisae.  D4 Unknown voted Alisae.  Then opens up D5 with a vote/unvote on me.<br>\n<br>\nWRT the D3 Frogger and D4 Alisae lynches...I'm of the opinion that scum would try to avoid supporting the Frogger lynch (knowing it would be a mislynch) and would support the auto-lynch of Alisae D4.  Unknown fits this belief the strongest (voted Alisae both D3&amp;4).  Followed by IAI (absent D3...voted Alisae D4) and Terata (no votes either day).<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">tl:dr;</div>  I think Unknown looks the worst from a VCA standpoint followed by IAI, Terata and then Lowell.<br>\n<br>\nI still want to look over Sheep and Alisae's ISOs, along with the living, and see if anything jumps out at me.<br>\n<br>\nIf I was going to vote now it would be on Unknown.", "time": "Mon Mar 06, 2017 3:27 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=70351&start=2050", "forum": "53", "thread": "70351"}

This conclusion just seems too pat for any number of reasons.  First, why would a town player just casually elimate 2/4 players from the lynch pool given that we presumably have two lynches left?<br>\n<br>\nSecond, it VERY much looks like he's dying to pocket me. I have been saying from the beginning that AT LEAST one scum must be off the sheep wagon. So who does gerry's death benefit then?

This conclusion just seems too pat for any number of reasons.  First, why would a town player just casually elimate 2/4 players from the lynch pool given that we presumably have two lynches left?<br>\n<br>\nSecond, it VERY much looks like he's dying to pocket me. I have been saying from the beginning that AT LEAST one scum must be off the sheep wagon. So who does gerry's death benefit then?  There are now only two players off the wagon (IaI and fitz) and two chances to lynch. If scum were one of those two, why wouldn't they kill off terata or me or Unknown in order to keep the number of non-sheep-bussing lynchable candidate pool higher? As it is, if I follow through with my plan of assuming both scum didn't wagon, I'm left with--surprise!--the same lynch pool as Unknown.<br>\n<br>\nAlso, in #1966 (I lost the link), Unknown says that if Ali is scum, fitz probably isn't.  So what changed?</div></blockquote>\n\nEverything in this post except the last post is being read as I'm confirmed scum. You aren't assuming what I would do if I'm Town, which makes no sense to do.<br>\n<br>\nI die a lot on my site n1 and n2 due to being almost always around and actively participating. I'll admit that it took me some time to get used to things on another site, so that probably wasn't something I should have expected. That being said, no clue why this part makes sense as a scum play so I want to hear you explain this.<br>\n<br>\nI already explained my obvious stand point, and it clearly doesn't correspond how you people play. I don't rely as much on night actions, and so if I had a super strong scum read and someone I was suspicious about right out of the get go, no way I'm believing a lead. If you are going to find it scummy how my play differs, then that's how it's going to be. Most reads are based on my regular play.<br>\n<br>\nAgain, if you believe I'm scum that's been trying way too hard to look Town all game, then you should really look again. I wasn't going to vote Frogger, and Alisae was always going to be my vote because I didn't believe the claim. I've seen worse gambits.<br>\n<br>\nLast post is where you don't make sense. Sure, I went into the day expecting to agree with Frogger and lynch both of those players like he wanted to. However, if it wasn't obvious to you I have been back tracking on what I said and have been considering other people. I still wouldn't be surprised if scum were still in both of them, but I have been reconsidering. I don't see why you think I'm specifically pocketing you, because I actually haven't even addressed you yet or been forcing anyone to death. You also seem to think I'm the one that has been \"pocketing\" the most, which I disagree with.<br>\n<br>\nLastly, it is obvious how my Havingfitz read changed. He wasn't able to slightly consider any Town motivation in my posts and said that everything I've done has been scummy. You don't even question that do you? You guys play so much weirder than I do.", "time": "Tue Mar 07, 2017 12:14 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=70351&start=2100", "forum": "53", "thread": "70351"}

I've read through all pages up until this point, and I do have some general reads. First, I want to say that I deliberately skipped reading Naomi's introduction post the moment I realized what it was. No offense, Naomi, but if you start all of your games that way, I'd very quickly want to avoid playing with you. It's an excuse in advance of scummy behavior; despite it likely being honest, the fact is, if your behavior is scummy regardless of alignment, you're still a detriment to town. Rather than attempting to safeguard your defensiveness from the start&#8212;hoping it serves to keep you in the game longer&#8212;I recommend learning to evolve your play style so as to not appear scummy, regardless of alignment. The \"Green\" vs. \"Red\" clarification is helpful, though, so thank you for that.<br>\n<br>\nFro99er, you certainly have an abrasive play style. Not something I appreciate, but likely something I can get use to. Voiding your posts of connotations, I generally agree with your sentiments, up until now at least. You are parroting your defense of comparing Cooperative Sheep to Axel from another game, however, which is coming across as slightly desperate. Despite some pressure coming off of Cooperative Sheep, you still seem very committed to going after them. To confirm, would you like to see Cooperative Sheep lynched today?<br>\n<br>\nCooperative Sheep has handled the initial pressure <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">very</div> scrupulously, and at the moment I wouldn't have any issue going through with a D1 lynch on them. Terata's responses throughout have also rubbed me the wrong way, particularly how he appearingly defended Cooperative Sheep in saying, \"It's likely you just handle your defense awkwardly, regardless of alignment.\" Shortly after, though, he joined in on the pressure on Cooperative Sheep, flat-out calling him scum. To me it appears he was attempting to play both sides in the event Cooperative Sheep might have actually been lynched so quickly&#8212;or in the event everyone backed off and he could be seen as one who wasn't as aggressive in an uncertain lynch.<br>\n<br>\nGerryoat's posts up until now have been primarily filler.<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8811975#p8811975\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8811975#p8811975\" data-post-id=\"8811975\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 20</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=28282\">gerryoat</a> wrote:</cite>I hardclaim town.</div></blockquote>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8811976#p8811976\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8811976#p8811976\" data-post-id=\"8811976\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 21</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=28282\">gerryoat</a> wrote:</cite>Was hoping to flip scum but alas, we are where we are</div></blockquote>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8812010#p8812010\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8812010#p8812010\" data-post-id=\"8812010\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 30</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=28282\">gerryoat</a> wrote:</cite>R u calling me maf</div></blockquote>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8812263#p8812263\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8812263#p8812263\" data-post-id=\"8812263\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 49</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=28282\">gerryoat</a> wrote:</cite>someone else vote so i can activate my 1 shot triple vote</div></blockquote>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8813096#p8813096\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8813096#p8813096\" data-post-id=\"8813096\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 58</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=28282\">gerryoat</a> wrote:</cite>I hardclaimed town.

But im not gonna say more on that, cuz it's pointless.<br>\n<br>\nSo, some thoughts.<br>\n<br>\nI'm never gonna vote Lowell this game, ever. The reason i caught sheep was because i thought Lowell felt town and i went looking for scum on that Wagon and sheep was the least towny one. I just don't ever see things playing out like they did if Lowell's scum.<br>\n<br>\nI still think the things i wrote about Sheep's comments on the unknown slot was pretty w/v-looking / spewy. And i think Unknowns way of handling this day has felt the towniest. Others have only been making cases made to convince others to lynch specific people while unknown has actually tried to have a conversation with people and evaluating them. Their way of swapping slowly from thinking i was town to re-isoing and finding things they disliked to still suspecting others felt VERY real to me. Also maybe im stupid but im buying the stuff about them not knowing about scum's day-chat and from feeling unknown out from reading their posts, i don't think they're a player to try to clear themselves from something that stupid. So im locking in them as town too.<br>\n<br>\nSo for me the path from here is pretty easy. just lynch fitz/IAI, and be done with it. But i know im a suspect so it isn't that easy.<br>\n<br>\nOk, so the biggest reason (from what i've precieved) to why IAI says im scum is that \"Alisae wouldn't have made the fakeclaim if the partner is in the back-then-suspects\". This is terrible logic. Scum KNOWS people evaluate their play after they die, so saying that Alisae and her partner didn't even think about how his claim would look after the flip is just beyond bad. Since scum would know for sure this logic would be taken up, if not by themselves (if you're scum) it will be taken up by the town (if someone else is the last scum). Right now im leaning SLIGHTLY more towards fitz, simply because you have focused so little on preparing the second mislynch after me if you're scum, and you're gonna look pretty bad when i flip town. This is wifom too of course and you could totally be scum doing this, but the way you swapped your second suspect in the span of 1 page felt like a move that scum perhaps wouldn't make if they're focused on getting me lynched.<br>\n<br>\nBut regardless, if im scum, and Frogg is harddefending me for the rest of the game, WHY would you fakeclaim a red on FROGG OF ALL PEOPLE that will lead you straight to the win. That no1 has taken this up yet is weirding me out.<br>\n<br>\nSo yeah, Lowell town, unknown town, 1 of fitz and IAI scum, leaning fitz.", "time": "Thu Mar 09, 2017 10:58 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=70351&start=2200", "forum": "53", "thread": "70351"}

And Fitz started arguing with someone (you i think?) after sheep was lynched about how bad it was that sheep was lynched.

Also the post i quoted with him not having ANY thoughts at all about my vote on sheep even though it was heavily discussed and obviously an important moment. Just kinda slipped it in there.<br>\n<br>\nAnd even though he has felt like he believes the push, he's also said that \"it's possible im wrong, this is why blablabla\" when he was talking to you earlier. And i don't think his questioning of me has reflected that. He's \"asked\" his question in a way that already feels decided, more like a case than wanting to know the answers from me. And the very last post from him today reflected that thought i had aswell. He had a chance to ask me for stuff and the thing he said was \"would you say this is how scum would deal with their partners?\" or something like that, implying im supposed to call myself scum (if i interpreted the question right). Just feelt wrong.<br>\n<br>\nThe reason why i suspected Fitz first was that i didn't remember the interactions from Naomi with Sheep and his way of handing sheep post-hammer and that he has felt kind of on the sidelines a big part of today.

The reason i caught sheep was because i thought Lowell felt town and i went looking for scum on that Wagon and sheep was the least towny one. I just don't ever see things playing out like they did if Lowell's scum.<br>\n<br>\nI still think the things i wrote about Sheep's comments on the unknown slot was pretty w/v-looking / spewy. And i think Unknowns way of handling this day has felt the towniest. Others have only been making cases made to convince others to lynch specific people while unknown has actually tried to have a conversation with people and evaluating them. Their way of swapping slowly from thinking i was town to re-isoing and finding things they disliked to still suspecting others felt VERY real to me. Also maybe im stupid but im buying the stuff about them not knowing about scum's day-chat and from feeling unknown out from reading their posts, i don't think they're a player to try to clear themselves from something that stupid. So im locking in them as town too.<br>\n<br>\nSo for me the path from here is pretty easy. just lynch fitz/IAI, and be done with it. But i know im a suspect so it isn't that easy.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Ok, so the biggest reason (from what i've precieved) to why IAI says im scum is that \"Alisae wouldn't have made the fakeclaim if the partner is in the back-then-suspects\". This is terrible logic. Scum KNOWS people evaluate their play after they die, so saying that Alisae and her partner didn't even think about how his claim would look after the flip is just beyond bad. Since scum would know for sure this logic would be taken up, if not by themselves (if you're scum) it will be taken up by the town (if someone else is the last scum). Right now im leaning SLIGHTLY more towards fitz, simply because you have focused so little on preparing the second mislynch after me if you're scum, and you're gonna look pretty bad when i flip town. This is wifom too of course and you could totally be scum doing this, but the way you swapped your second suspect in the span of 1 page felt like a move that scum perhaps wouldn't make if they're focused on getting me lynched.</div><br>\n<br>\nBut regardless, if im scum, and Frogg is harddefending me for the rest of the game, WHY would you fakeclaim a red on FROGG OF ALL PEOPLE that will lead you straight to the win.

Since scum would know for sure this logic would be taken up, if not by themselves (if you're scum) it will be taken up by the town (if someone else is the last scum).

So either:<br>\n<br>\n1) You're town reading abilities are so strong that you are in the top third of the class or<br>\n2) You're scum that knew Lowell was town and didn't want to join a partner on his wagon, so threw a vanity vote at your partner in hopes for town cred later (for staying off Lowell and if Sheep flipped, being on him), and disappeared when his wagon took off.<br>\n<br>\nI know which one I think is more likely.<br>\n<br>\nPS - you're buddying \"I'm never gonna vote Lowell this game, ever\" after it is established that nobody else is interested in voting him/aka he's not a viable wagon is noted.<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8959085#p8959085\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8959085#p8959085\" data-post-id=\"8959085\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 2223</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=29388\">Terata</a> wrote:</cite>And i think Unknowns way of handling this day has felt the towniest.

The key to this game is Day 1 and Day 2, that is where the evidence is. Beyond that, there isn't much, other than why the heck did Alisea pull a 1 for 1 gambit with only 1 remaining teammate.<br>\n<br>\nSo yes, I am going to go back to the evidence from Day 1 to Day 2, to see how people interacted with Sheep and Penguin/Alisea, and vice versa. Outside of your half hearted vote to start a wagon on sheep, you did ZERO towny stuff D1 and D2. None, notta. But you sure scummed it up in hindsight.

This is terrible logic. Scum KNOWS people evaluate their play after they die, so saying that Alisae and her partner didn't even think about how his claim would look after the flip is just beyond bad. Since scum would know for sure this logic would be taken up, if not by themselves (if you're scum) it will be taken up by the town (if someone else is the last scum). Right now im leaning SLIGHTLY more towards fitz, simply because you have focused so little on preparing the second mislynch after me if you're scum, and you're gonna look pretty bad when i flip town. This is wifom too of course and you could totally be scum doing this, but the way you swapped your second suspect in the span of 1 page felt like a move that scum perhaps wouldn't make if they're focused on getting me lynched.</div></blockquote>\n\nDid you even read my posts? I put a whole case with every scummy post you made D1 and D2. And guess what, there is A LOT!<br>\n<br>\nDid you also read that the Alisea gambit didn't point to you, but to you, Unknown, and Lowell. Lowell though, when looking at interactions with scum, comes out looking nearly confirmed town. Unknown/Lil, had just as many good posts as bad. In one post Unknown pushed both Sheep and Penguin, and only Sheep and Penguin. How often does scum do this....not very often.<br>\n<br>\nYou never pushed them. Outside of that vote, which you then disappeared from, you did nothing. Even when you put Sheep in your scummy pile, you then defended him saying \"he's trying\"<br>\n<br>\nWHAT DOES IT MEAN WHEN A SCUM READ OF YOURS IS TRYING???<br>\n<br>\nBecause if that isn't defense of a scummate you are leaning scum read on, then I don't what it is.</div></blockquote>\n\nOfc i didn't look at EVERYONE who had voted Lowell throughout the day, I looked at the people ATM at the top wagon who i thought was town. And you acting like the first case is what i did is either brainless or agenda-y. And how you're setting it up to seem like it's either this made up narrative OR im a wolf is making me lean towards the latter. PS. you saying i made up the Lowell town read TODAY to buddy him is among the most constructed things i've heard yet, with how i caught scum d1 BY townreading him and finding scum on his freaking wagon. How was it ever unclear i was never voting Lowell today even before i said that. wtf.<br>\n<br>\nYou acting like how people acts recently doesn't matter when that's the only time you've been in the game is so disingenious and completely false.

Don't really recall why though.<br>\n<br>\nMy observation of the lone saving grace for Terata, i.e. the Sheep wagon, is - I agree that it could very easily have been a harmless vote on one of the most popular D1 suspects with no real hope of it leading to a lynch.<br>\n<br>\nLowell was not an option because Terata had been town reading him all day.  And the only other real option was my wagon with 2 votes on it and I had been (Naomi that is) a town read for terata as well.  So the only wagon that made any sense for Terata to move to (off the PR wagon she had for some reasons continued to support) was Sheep.  And that vote looked safe with Lowell at L-2.<br>\n<br>\nI also found Terata's <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8881359#p8881359\">Post 1591</a> interesting in that it bestowed towncred on everyone on the Sheep wagon (so that's Terata and Alisae to name two) while adding the caveat that Unknown's hammer did not get \"big points.\"<br>\n<br>\nLeft Alisae out of ISO results on Sheep at bottom of <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8900631#p8900631\">Post 1691</a>.<br>\n<br>\nSays will most likely vote ECM on D2 but never actually does.<br>\nCasts suspicions D2 towards Chaos in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8902038#p8902038\">Post 1706</a> but never actually votes Chaos....though the Chaos wagon takes off immediately after this post with subsequent votes by Lowell and Wheme.<br>\n<br>\nI don't like that Terata basically diasappeared after D1.

If there is a 1v1 situation that early in the game pitting a claimed PR against a VT...I'm going to opt for believing the claim.  Even if the claim was a lie (as it turned out to be)...town was still setting themselves up to be rid of the 2nd mafia member the following day and still in possession of two chances to get the last mafia member.

Seems like she has had a few stretches where she has been absent.  Also, she hasn't made a vote since D1 so VCA is not that telling on her.

ECM never voted otes on Alisae or Sheep.  Alisae however on D2 did vote ECM with conviction (up to L-1).

But it looks better than if Alisae had totally ignored ECM.<br>\n<br>\nUnknown...replaced LUV mid-D1.  Luv had done some light voting (bussing?) on Sheep D1.  Unknown entered the game and chose to vote me (a negative fmpov) and hammered Sheep.  Hammering scum is good.  Hammering scum when it is a foregone conclusion scum is going to be lynched...not as good.  But at least not bad.  D2..Unknown put the Chaos mislynch wagon at L-2 two posts before Froger hammered.

Then opens up D5 with a vote/unvote on me.<br>\n<br>\nWRT the D3 Frogger and D4 Alisae lynches...I'm of the opinion that scum would try to avoid supporting the Frogger lynch (knowing it would be a mislynch) and would support the auto-lynch of Alisae D4.

And when everyone has put their opinions on the table, THEN he comes up with the long post starting up with \"i DID have sheep and terata as scum from the start\" to justify him swapping back to me again. And he also swaps his opinion of my sheep vote.

Thanks for answering my question. I may have been hopped up on cold meds last night but I didn't think the case on sheep was that strong so I didn't mind switching my vote to get some response and shake up some people.<br>\n<br>\n Tho personally I don't see what's so scummy as jumping off a wagon and onto another to get some engagement and conversation. It's d1. And early too. I want lots of people talking today not just tunnel on sheep :/<br>\n<br>\nAlso why Gerry? If you thought Sheep's slip was something substantial wouldn't that mean you're inclined to town read Gerry since he was implying that Gerry is town?<br>\n<br>\nPedit: ^ What Fro99er said. Though Im still only partially sold on it being a legit slip. I can easily see this as being a misnomer. Sheep's reaction to the whole thing seems pretty indifferent he's not trying to hard to deny it as a slip more so just saying it's silly to think of it as a slip.</div></blockquote>\n\nI thought it was but after a reread I don't trust Gerry and his recent posts make me think he's scum. Just because you agree with someone doesn't mean you think they're town. I know people won't follow me on to him because Sheep is basically telling himself but that's fine. We can get Gerry tomorrow or even now to put me at ease if the rest of you are town reading him. <br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: </span><br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Sheep</span></div></blockquote>\n\nInteresting string of posts.

On the surface it looks like just filler, but if you look and think it about it on a deeper level, he's arguable treating himself as confirmed town that shouldn't be considered for a lynch today by anyone for getting the game out of RVS as well as starting a wagon on Sheep. <br>\n<br>\nFast forward to a bit to <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8814765#p8814765\">134</a>, he does the same thing again by discrediting not only Naomi's read on him but also her as a player by bringing up a previous game without any context in which he claims he got two members of the scum team lynched.<br>\n<br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8814782#p8814782\">136</a> is self explanatory. <br>\n<br>\nI'm inclined to believe <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8815105#p8815105\">152</a> is more scum motivated than town motivated and it only reinforces my read on him. He's hints at a PR of some sort and says he shouldn't be lynched today. There was no pressure on him at the time and the overall focus was on Sheep as well as the various arguments Frog was getting into so it was odd for him to drop that soft like it's hot and just leave. Scum have more to gain by bread crumbing in my opinion. It helps them with fake claiming and it can potential draw doctors and jail keepers to them.<br>\n<br>\nTL:DR: Gerry has been been basically treating himself as confirmed town since RVS ended.<br>\n<br>\nI think Gerry tried to distance from Sheep early and it sort of backfired a bit.
