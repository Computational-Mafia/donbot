Looks to me like you just slipped it in there as a \"lalala, im just RVS-voting, don't mind me\". I either expect a serious vote on for example Sheep with some comment attached, with your suspicion and what YOU didn't like about him, or an obvious RVS vote on some1 that isn't a mainwagon or very active. This is in between and it pings me."}

Sorry about this major delay but yesterday was pretty busy and tonight is gonna be pretty busy too. but I do have like 6-7 hours free so better start despite not having a comfortable amount of sleep.<br><br>Hi all, For those who have played with me before feel free to skip the rest of this post its my usual post. For those who havn't played with me before Its important you read this post.<br><br>First thing to note; from this point on I'm going to call mafia red and town Green when ever I can. This is because I don't feel comfortable calling mafia players scum or scummy as its kinda insulting for getting essentially a random role. We all get mafia sometime and I feel we shouldn't insult people for being so. Which is why I started using colours.<br><br>Okay so I'm Naomi and I kinda have my own play style. Unlike most people I do worry about myself dying as both alignments as I don't like sitting out. This can lead me to take actions that are normally more  Red aligned as Green. Things such as LAMIST actions are pretty common. I balance this by being entirely open with my posts and playing with my cards face up as much as possible and only lying when setting up a trap, which I try to limit to a minimum. I also find it harder and harder to get reads if a lot of things are focused on myself as I like to review interactions between others to determine alignment and I'm not able to judge using myself and it kinda skews my perception if I'm constantly assaulted. I also will be defensive if attacked until I feel convinced that I can't convince the attacker that I'm Green. I love discussion and will always answer questions put to me though (But sometimes I forget or miss it so you may have to ask again). If I noticed that someone is reaction baiting myself I will answer the question but also provide a over the top response. Other than all of this I do like to give read lists on day 1 but I kinda stop later in the game in favour of a POE list. <br><br>I also have a strange play style as Green as I like to seek the people I think are more likely to be Green. This is because as Green people generally are not trying to look green and just being themselves so its easier to pick up greens. So.. my red hunting comprises of first eliminating those who are likely to be green then focusing on my remaining pool and trying to sort bad play from red play. <br><br>Finally; This entire post is NAI. I make this kinda post regardless of alignment. It exists as an informative piece on my unique meta. I tend to make it for my second post in the majority of my games. If you wish to manually explore my meta please feel free to open my wiki where you can see all the games I've been in sorted by alignment."}

Looks to me like you just slipped it in there as a \"lalala, im just RVS-voting, don't mind me\". I either expect a serious vote on for example Sheep with some comment attached, with your suspicion and what YOU didn't like about him, or an obvious RVS vote on some1 that isn't a mainwagon or very active. This is in between and it pings me.</div></blockquote><br><br>The problem is your assumptions. Instead of asking me why I'm scum reading Sheep, you assume that I was RVS voting. If you'd like to know why I voted for someone, just ask.</div></blockquote><br><br>i never said i thought you were RVS voting because of who you voted. But it was closely phrased as one considering ur posts until then was basically \"hi guys\" or something, and there was nothing attached. That looks like an RVS, even though i know it couldn't have been, since you don't RVS vote a big wagon. That was my problem. You can tell me your reasoning if you had any, but that doesn't change that it looks bad to me"}

I've read through all pages up until this point, and I do have some general reads. First, I want to say that I deliberately skipped reading Naomi's introduction post the moment I realized what it was. No offense, Naomi, but if you start all of your games that way, I'd very quickly want to avoid playing with you. It's an excuse in advance of scummy behavior; despite it likely being honest, the fact is, if your behavior is scummy regardless of alignment, you're still a detriment to town. Rather than attempting to safeguard your defensiveness from the start\u2014hoping it serves to keep you in the game longer\u2014I recommend learning to evolve your play style so as to not appear scummy, regardless of alignment. The \"Green\" vs. \"Red\" clarification is helpful, though, so thank you for that.<br><br>Fro99er, you certainly have an abrasive play style. Not something I appreciate, but likely something I can get use to. Voiding your posts of connotations, I generally agree with your sentiments, up until now at least. You are parroting your defense of comparing Cooperative Sheep to Axel from another game, however, which is coming across as slightly desperate.

So, sure, I think you believe your initial read on Sheep's play style. But what's a bit weird to me is you're saying, \"Why wouldn't I share these thoughts, because it will help your own reads?\" But you admittedly don't know these players and deliberately make it known by saying, \"I don't know how they play, but...\" You did the same with Fro99er here:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8815547#p8815547\" class=\"postlink\">post 202</a>, Terata wrote:</cite>Frog being dismissive and non-caring and then having this quick turn.

I don't know anyone's play styles here, so I'm just commenting on what I see as tells. If others are familiar with their play styles, they can attribute their behaviors to such.

Thanks for answering my question. I may have been hopped up on cold meds last night but I didn't think the case on sheep was that strong so I didn't mind switching my vote to get some response and shake up some people.<br><br> Tho personally I don't see what's so scummy as jumping off a wagon and onto another to get some engagement and conversation. It's d1. And early too. I want lots of people talking today not just tunnel on sheep :/<br><br>Also why Gerry? If you thought Sheep's slip was something substantial wouldn't that mean you're inclined to town read Gerry since he was implying that Gerry is town?<br><br>Pedit: ^ What Fro99er said. Though Im still only partially sold on it being a legit slip. I can easily see this as being a misnomer. Sheep's reaction to the whole thing seems pretty indifferent he's not trying to hard to deny it as a slip more so just saying it's silly to think of it as a slip.</div></blockquote><br><br>I thought it was but after a reread I don't trust Gerry and his recent posts make me think he's scum. Just because you agree with someone doesn't mean you think they're town. I know people won't follow me on to him because Sheep is basically telling himself but that's fine. We can get Gerry tomorrow or even now to put me at ease if the rest of you are town reading him. <br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: </span><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Sheep</span>"}

So i take that into account, even though i don't really agree with your thought that him being in daychat would change his play very much. Players doesn't usually use daychat THAT much even though it's very good to do so. Though maybe it's different on this site and people post everything through there, but i don't see Sheep doing that. Players who are awkward like him with bad logic, is gonna look bad as either alignment in thay way imo."}

Doesn't even consider that me and Lowell may have played with each other outside of this game and his vote was a means of saying hi. Just assumes that Lowell will be hard to cooperate with.

If you all go back and read the post of Naomi's he linked, she isn't defending him, she's questioning Gerry based on what she thinks Sheep meant and how Sheep reacted to the accusation.

That post, however, is the only one I can find that even remotely links your suspicion to Hawk, and you have yet to elaborate on it at all, despite joining in with others on the Hawk vote and despite explicitly being asked to clarify your reasoning in Post 241.

It wasn't because a vote was on me, it was  because the person who placed the vote on me asked a question.

It just doesn't read that way to me. The Pepto one you're referring to from Mafiaception was blatant. He voted a big wagon stressing a bunch of caution, got called on his weakness, and responded he doesn't want a mislynch. Definition of a slip. The Sheep slip is just parsing something a certain way. I read it as \"Oh, you're confirmed town?

It strikes me as odd. Why specifically ask Wheme, and why specifically about my pressure on sheep? I get that my pressure on sheep was the big thing happening at the time, but chaos doesn't give his own thoughts on it because, as he replies to me in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8813126#p8813126\">59</a> \"I don't think they'd be super helpful.\" Yet he expects Wheme's thoughts to be super helpful or something?<br><br>Also, Chaos mentions he's not about the sheep wagon, but does not state why. It's an attempt to disrail the wagon without having to put in the work of doing so.<br><br>In 59, chaos continues <br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>So, frog is town for the push on Sheep. This would lead me to think that you think his reasoning is good/genuine/some other good words. If this is the case, why be suspicious of other people agreeing and why townread Sheep? If this is not the case, why townread frogger?</div></blockquote><br>He pressures Wheme about why wheme is suspicious of people sheeping me on sheep, the townread on sheep, and the townread on me, as if it's some sort of contradiction. But Wheme actually replies in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8813184#p8813184\">63</a> <blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I think the push on sheep is weak, and frog made it seem like it was strong to get reactions out of everyone</div></blockquote><br><br>That's a fair response, and jives with how he could see both sheep and myself as town, yet suspect others on the sheep wagon.<br><br>But here's where chaos gets manipulative. In post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8814327#p8814327\">109</a> Chaos asks me for my take on my own push on Sheep. Chaos has played with me twice before, once in my perfect scum win in BEES, and once in our perfect town win in MAFIACEPTION. So he knows I don't fuck around with my pushes. So I give my take that I'm serious about my push (which Chaos knew from meta, and if he's scum he also knows I'm town making a genuine push).<br><br>(I'll have more to say about 109 in a minute, but I want to continue on this line of thought around Wheme)<br><br>In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8818261#p8818261\">282</a> Chaos says <blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I assumed your push was genuine, and it seems like I was right.</div></blockquote> He confirms he knew that my push was genuine, so this is clearly an attempt to turn this around on either Wheme or myself, which he does later in the same post <blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>So this (wheme's post 63) has been proven wrong. frogger believes the strength of his push on Sheep. Since you think the push is weak, does this change your read of frogger at all?</div></blockquote> This is manipulative because if Wheme answers \"yes, my read has changed so now I read frog as scum\" or if wheme answers \"No\" then Chaos can come back with \"then your original reason for townreading frogger for a weak push on sheep was a lie, because you townread him anyway\". Manipulative as hell. It pushes the suspicion elsewhere, while chaos doesn't actually do any work around the sheep wagon himself.<br><br>Here's where I come back to chaos' post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8814327#p8814327\">109</a>. He answer's Naomi's question to him with a combo of 1 and 3, meaning a combo of \"I don't think sheep slipped\" and \"I don't have strong feelings on sheep.\" My issue is he's expecting everyone else to have feelings around myself and sheep, yet he can't provide any himself. He just want to create Chaos (pun intended) around the sheep/frog thing, while sidelining what he thinks of me and sheep himself.<br><br>There's also the \"slip\" stuff which Gerry pointed out and I agreed with, and Chaos actively defended against. That was a second,more indirect attempt at derailing the sheep wagon. We disagree about the slip, and this argument won't get us anywhere, but I don't believe this gels with my meta of Chaos using the slip in MAFIACEPTION, even if he says its different. I was town there, and I'm town here, and I still like to push possible slips when I see its possible there was one. For chaos to dismiss it so quickly, given what he did in MAFIACEPTION and how easy it was for other scum to dismiss it so quickly, is just another little point.<br><br>The clincher is his post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8822450#p8822450\">341</a> where he accuses Terata of doing the same thing he did around questioning Wheme. Yes, terata did question Wheme, about the exact same thing, and Terata even called Chaos out in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8818351#p8818351\">283</a> for saying Chaos' post where he then pushes back on Wheme now that I've said my push on sheep was real. But the difference is in their tone. It's going to sound really fucking dumb, but the tone of how chaos did it vs. the tone in which Terata did it is miles apart.

I hate walls for the most part, so this makes me a \"giant fucking hypocrite\" (remember that phrase)<br><br>There's several problems I have with Chaos' play so far. Some are more meta-based, but some are more evidence based in this game.<br><br>Chaos opens up in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8813059#p8813059\">54</a> voting Wheme, and asking him what he thinks about my pressure on sheep. It strikes me as odd. Why specifically ask Wheme, and why specifically about my pressure on sheep? I get that my pressure on sheep was the big thing happening at the time, but chaos doesn't give his own thoughts on it because, as he replies to me in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8813126#p8813126\">59</a> \"I don't think they'd be super helpful.\" Yet he expects Wheme's thoughts to be super helpful or something?<br><br>Also, Chaos mentions he's not about the sheep wagon, but does not state why. It's an attempt to disrail the wagon without having to put in the work of doing so.<br><br>In 59, chaos continues <br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>So, frog is town for the push on Sheep. This would lead me to think that you think his reasoning is good/genuine/some other good words. If this is the case, why be suspicious of other people agreeing and why townread Sheep? If this is not the case, why townread frogger?</div></blockquote><br>He pressures Wheme about why wheme is suspicious of people sheeping me on sheep, the townread on sheep, and the townread on me, as if it's some sort of contradiction. But Wheme actually replies in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8813184#p8813184\">63</a> <blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I think the push on sheep is weak, and frog made it seem like it was strong to get reactions out of everyone</div></blockquote><br><br>That's a fair response, and jives with how he could see both sheep and myself as town, yet suspect others on the sheep wagon.<br><br>But here's where chaos gets manipulative. In post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8814327#p8814327\">109</a> Chaos asks me for my take on my own push on Sheep. Chaos has played with me twice before, once in my perfect scum win in BEES, and once in our perfect town win in MAFIACEPTION. So he knows I don't fuck around with my pushes. So I give my take that I'm serious about my push (which Chaos knew from meta, and if he's scum he also knows I'm town making a genuine push).<br><br>(I'll have more to say about 109 in a minute, but I want to continue on this line of thought around Wheme)<br><br>In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8818261#p8818261\">282</a> Chaos says <blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I assumed your push was genuine, and it seems like I was right.</div></blockquote> He confirms he knew that my push was genuine, so this is clearly an attempt to turn this around on either Wheme or myself, which he does later in the same post <blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>So this (wheme's post 63) has been proven wrong. frogger believes the strength of his push on Sheep. Since you think the push is weak, does this change your read of frogger at all?</div></blockquote> This is manipulative because if Wheme answers \"yes, my read has changed so now I read frog as scum\" or if wheme answers \"No\" then Chaos can come back with \"then your original reason for townreading frogger for a weak push on sheep was a lie, because you townread him anyway\". Manipulative as hell. It pushes the suspicion elsewhere, while chaos doesn't actually do any work around the sheep wagon himself.<br><br>Here's where I come back to chaos' post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8814327#p8814327\">109</a>. He answer's Naomi's question to him with a combo of 1 and 3, meaning a combo of \"I don't think sheep slipped\" and \"I don't have strong feelings on sheep.\" My issue is he's expecting everyone else to have feelings around myself and sheep, yet he can't provide any himself. He just want to create Chaos (pun intended) around the sheep/frog thing, while sidelining what he thinks of me and sheep himself.<br><br>There's also the \"slip\" stuff which Gerry pointed out and I agreed with, and Chaos actively defended against. That was a second,more indirect attempt at derailing the sheep wagon. We disagree about the slip, and this argument won't get us anywhere, but I don't believe this gels with my meta of Chaos using the slip in MAFIACEPTION, even if he says its different. I was town there, and I'm town here, and I still like to push possible slips when I see its possible there was one. For chaos to dismiss it so quickly, given what he did in MAFIACEPTION and how easy it was for other scum to dismiss it so quickly, is just another little point.<br><br>The clincher is his post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8822450#p8822450\">341</a> where he accuses Terata of doing the same thing he did around questioning Wheme. Yes, terata did question Wheme, about the exact same thing, and Terata even called Chaos out in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8818351#p8818351\">283</a> for saying Chaos' post where he then pushes back on Wheme now that I've said my push on sheep was real. But the difference is in their tone. It's going to sound really fucking dumb, but the tone of how chaos did it vs. the tone in which Terata did it is miles apart.

Good post.<br><br>What i again don't like with his way of responding is that he lashes out hard with logic to condemn me and still ends up with the conclusion of \"bad town or scum\", which is basically still saying absolutely 0 about my alignment. Scum tends to do that, lashing out in an attempt to defend themselves without really trying to determine the alignment of the one who accuses them. I feel really good about Chaos being scum right now, and i don't usually feel good about my scum reads d1. FeelsGoodMan"}

One way to elumate would be to assign a score or rating system like the one seen here.

Because I asked, given this information he didn't have before, if his read has changed at all. There's a range of options, and I wanted to see how he would re-evaluate his read given one of his premises was wrong. You made plenty of other posts after the early push on Sheep, it's not as if he has to scumread you if his position changes here. I was more looking for any sort of progression from Wheme's earlier reads, since he looks like he established some early and is fitting his play around those early reads to stay consistent and isn't actually scumhunting.<br><br>And why do you keep bringing up the fucking Sheep wagon? He is not in my top 3 scumreads currently, and I'm not interested in pursuing it.

I was town there, and I'm town here, and I still like to push possible slips when I see its possible there was one.

I think mafia has a different kind of hmm.. way? of trying to show pro-towniness. And 1 way i've seen more than others is the way of talking a lot about old meta/mechanics/contraditions, because it's something they can observe as OBJECTIVELY scummy, and genuinely push on, which they can't do with general reads and subjective reads, when they have TMI. see what im getting at?</div></blockquote><br>Not really. My point is that your question seems completely taken part-and-parcel from my question. So why is it scummy if I ask it but not scummy if you ask the same question?</div></blockquote><br><br>i don't think the question is scummy  by itself. Does that answer the question?</div></blockquote><br>Yes, but then there's another question. Here's your summary of my <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8818261#p8818261\">282</a> where I asked that question:<br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>this post reads very scripted/forced to me, and the only time he goes into a little bit of a deeper analysis is when he's comparing something to a past game, which is something that's easy to talk about when you're scum because it's something you believe in and can give your true thoughts on. Also looking for contradictions/unexplained progressions more than i'd like. I think that's sometimes a mafia trait too, because it's a simple thing to look for/push on.<br><br>Scummiest post of the game thus far to me</div></blockquote><br>So I was focusing on your criticism that the questions focused on contradictions and unexplained progressions, but that is not by itself enough to make it scummy. That's fair. So I guess the tone here is the clincher. Can you explain how my tone in 282 seems to be scripted or forced, and how when you asked seemingly the same question in 311, your tone was more natural?</div></blockquote><br><br>im not gonna describe my own play since that's pretty pointless but for the problems i had with your post, it was mainly the lack of anything i feel i coming from your gut more than something you could \"think up\" as solving. It's usually mixed in with the reads of players and i felt like you lacked that. I took some examples of things you did that i think lacked that, and that questions was 1 thing, you asking for someone's read without any additional thoughts was one. And then your slightly longer explanation around the older game. I guess i don't have any STRONG problems with your tone in the question more than the lack of things i like surrounding it. Tho when fr099 mentioned it i do agree it looked a bit shady how you asked IF it changed Wheme's read on Fr099 when you knew yourself it didn't change. I would've liked you to mention the \"trap\" before waiting for his answer. Also you lacked content aside from that post i liked, so that strengthened my feeling you lacked any reads you truly believed in."}

So I give my take that I'm serious about my push (which Chaos knew from meta, and if he's scum he also knows I'm town making a genuine push).<br><br>(I'll have more to say about 109 in a minute, but I want to continue on this line of thought around Wheme)<br><br>In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8818261#p8818261\">282</a> Chaos says <blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I assumed your push was genuine, and it seems like I was right.</div></blockquote> He confirms he knew that my push was genuine, so this is clearly an attempt to turn this around on either Wheme or myself, which he does later in the same post <blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>So this (wheme's post 63) has been proven wrong. frogger believes the strength of his push on Sheep. Since you think the push is weak, does this change your read of frogger at all?</div></blockquote> This is manipulative because if Wheme answers \"yes, my read has changed so now I read frog as scum\" or if wheme answers \"No\" then Chaos can come back with \"then your original reason for townreading frogger for a weak push on sheep was a lie, because you townread him anyway\". Manipulative as hell. It pushes the suspicion elsewhere, while chaos doesn't actually do any work around the sheep wagon himself.<br><br>Here's where I come back to chaos' post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8814327#p8814327\">109</a>. He answer's Naomi's question to him with a combo of 1 and 3, meaning a combo of \"I don't think sheep slipped\" and \"I don't have strong feelings on sheep.\" My issue is he's expecting everyone else to have feelings around myself and sheep, yet he can't provide any himself. He just want to create Chaos (pun intended) around the sheep/frog thing, while sidelining what he thinks of me and sheep himself.<br><br>There's also the \"slip\" stuff which Gerry pointed out and I agreed with, and Chaos actively defended against. That was a second,more indirect attempt at derailing the sheep wagon. We disagree about the slip, and this argument won't get us anywhere, but I don't believe this gels with my meta of Chaos using the slip in MAFIACEPTION, even if he says its different. I was town there, and I'm town here, and I still like to push possible slips when I see its possible there was one. For chaos to dismiss it so quickly, given what he did in MAFIACEPTION and how easy it was for other scum to dismiss it so quickly, is just another little point.<br><br>The clincher is his post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8822450#p8822450\">341</a> where he accuses Terata of doing the same thing he did around questioning Wheme. Yes, terata did question Wheme, about the exact same thing, and Terata even called Chaos out in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8818351#p8818351\">283</a> for saying Chaos' post where he then pushes back on Wheme now that I've said my push on sheep was real. But the difference is in their tone. It's going to sound really fucking dumb, but the tone of how chaos did it vs. the tone in which Terata did it is miles apart. Here's the difference:<br><br>Chaos:<br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>So this has been proven wrong. frogger believes the strength of his push on Sheep. Since you think the push is weak, does this change your read of frogger at all?</div></blockquote><br>Terata:<br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Wheme, you said early you liked Frog for overblowing the \"weak\" (as you called it) push on Sheep and searching for reactions. Did your read on Frogg change anything when you got to know Frogg's push was geniune and not simply a push for reactions. As you said he's still a townread i would assume no? so did he do something else you liked or did it still deserve a townread from you for pushing something you called \"weak\"?</div></blockquote></div></blockquote><br><br>Terata asks hers in a way that uses lighter, less accusatory tone for example \"when you got to know Frogg's push was genuine\" (use of the word genuine), \"As you said he's still a townread i would assume no?\" (benefit of the doubt), \"so did he do something else you liked or did it still deserve a townread from you\" (gives Wheme the option of still townreading me for something else, deserve a townread is a much more engaging tone).<br><br>Chaos was \"So this has been proven wrong\" (Wheme was wrong), \"does this change your read of frogger at all?\" (comapared to terata's does frog still deserve a townread and maybe are there other reasons)<br><br>IDK...it's just tone. I don't really remember Chaos taking this tone in BEES or MAFIACEPTION as town, but that's speculation on my part until I re-read.[quote]</div></div></div>"}

Well it's all the things that pinged me in this post. <br>He seems super apologetic in his wordings which i haven't really seen from his previous play, an example being \"im trying my best to help town\" (talking about town as a seperate entity). I also had a problem with how he tries to take credit for coming up with certain reads that he clearly sheeped from others in the thread. If he said he sheeped them it would be completely fine, but he talks like he thought them up himself. Specifically the one about Lowell slipping about AJ's reads but also a little about the Sheep read, which was summarized with what problems other's have had with Sheep all game (and this is after he read the posts \"over and over\").<br><br>He made sure to point out someone who had done less pro-town things than he has (gerry) which mafia loves to do when they feel they're getting pressure even though there are towns not showing towniness. And he KEPT saying he's having the same null/townread about Gerry which he had for the same reason as earlier that had been called out by BOTH gerry and frogg, who you're still saying pointed out the initial slip. He just won't back down from his initial statement even though it's clearly wrong, and that's much more scummy than being wrong in the first place in this scenario. Also, why would he even say Gerry's been contributing less than he has if he's still null-townreading gerry? Seems like standard shade to me.<br><br>Last but not least i dislike in what form he gives his Naomi read. He says it like \"I also think Lowell is wrong on Naomi...\" as to shade Lowell (his scumread) for being wrong on a town, which seems like a tmi read to me if i've ever seen one. That read just doesn't come naturally to you to call Lowell wrong in your case on him if you don't know the alignment of the person being read. And disliked how he phrased \"id like to vote\" at the end. A struggling finish to a scummy post.<br><br>This is what a confident vote looks like <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: WhemeStar</span> !<br><br>(Chaos made me doubt since his comeback)"}

Only thing he contributed too was saying sheep slipped, and claimed that he was the one who pointed out the slip, but Frogger did IMO. But I don't think mafia would do what gerry is doing, so Im going to say he's null-town<br><br>Sheep and Frogger have been going at it all game. At first I thought it was froggy just trying to get reactions out of others, but then it kept going on and on. After reading both of their posts over and over I think sheep is trying to just blame froggy of not reading his posts/answering his questions/misrepping him. Which I think is a scummy move, just asking questions over and over again.  I thought sheep's slip wasn't really a slip, but his posts lately have me thinking he is possible scum. <br><br>Lowell- I don't like some of his posts, such as iso #2. Where he voted sheep and said \"is the slip real? who knows\". Seems to me like he didn't have much reason to vote sheep and he didn't really care. I do like his recap on post #355 though. Also said that EC/Naomi flipped when he had a FOS on them, yet I don't see anything that shows them flippinng out. Possible scum. <br><br>look at the 2 bolded statements<br>I find it really strange how Lowell said AJ's posts are spot on and right. Yet in a previous post, AJ said that he thinks Lowell is scum. Is that a slip? I also think that Lowell is wrong on Naomi, she seems genuine town for me, and I will be against a lynch on her for a while. <br><br>EC, please get avatar, pls. EC voted me for not explaining my vote on Hawk? Which I thought I did, and I had nothing else to say about it. Used my previous posts as an example of me saying nothing. And said me getting a vote on me is the reason I became substantial. Which was wrong.<br><br>If you guys want more or if I missed some things, ask and Ill try to explain best I can. <br>For now, id like to vote lowell. <br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: </span><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Lowell</span></div></blockquote><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8824421#p8824421\" class=\"postlink\">post 463</a>, WhemeStar wrote:</cite>I<span class=\"noboldsig\"> said with gerrry not contributing he could be town because I don't see in any reality where scum doesn't say anything</span>.

Right now I read the two sides and agreed one one of them. For instance, as you pointed out. Someone else posted nearly the same thing I did with Lowell's ISO #2. And I agree with that person (forgot who).

On the surface it looks like just filler, but if you look and think it about it on a deeper level, he's arguable treating himself as confirmed town that shouldn't be considered for a lynch today by anyone for getting the game out of RVS as well as starting a wagon on Sheep. <br><br>Fast forward to a bit to <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8814765#p8814765\">134</a>, he does the same thing again by discrediting not only Naomi's read on him but also her as a player by bringing up a previous game without any context in which he claims he got two members of the scum team lynched.<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8814782#p8814782\">136</a> is self explanatory. <br><br>I'm inclined to believe <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8815105#p8815105\">152</a> is more scum motivated than town motivated and it only reinforces my read on him. He's hints at a PR of some sort and says he shouldn't be lynched today. There was no pressure on him at the time and the overall focus was on Sheep as well as the various arguments Frog was getting into so it was odd for him to drop that soft like it's hot and just leave. Scum have more to gain by bread crumbing in my opinion.

The whole frogger-WhemeStar convo from <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8814915#p8814915\">144</a> to <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8815097#p8815097\">151</a> is good to look at. frogger expresses suspicion of Wheme if Sheep flips town, and Wheme seems worried about it in response, asking why in 145 and then nervously trying to figure out what frogger is scumreading him for in 148, and then the pathetic placation in 150. If Wheme was town, why the fuck would he just roll over like that and try to appease frogger as opposed to confronting him? It's like he knows he's guilty, and is just trying to be nice and fade into the background. This exchange is part of the reason I'm not sold on Sheep-scum, since I'm assuming Wheme is scum and his reaction would not have been like that if Sheep was his partner; he would just shut up and take the town-cred on a Sheep lynch.<br><br>Wheme was townreading Sheep for most of this game from the beginning (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8813065#p8813065\">56</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8819010#p8819010\">307</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8819851#p8819851\">332</a>, etc.).

At first I thought it was froggy just trying to get reactions out of others, but then it kept going on and on.

Which I think is a scummy move, just asking questions over and over again.

In 332, your town read on Sheep is explicitly from how he is defending himself, and now in 458, his defense is why he is scummy. It's a complete 180 with no progression.<br><br>Let's talk about your readlist in 507:<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8824823#p8824823\" class=\"postlink\">post 507</a>, WhemeStar wrote:</cite><span style=\"color: #00BF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Froggy<br>Naomi <br>Tereta - Like his posts and his pushes on me and others<br>AJ - like how he pushes some people like Tereta is, asked questions to get discussion.</span></span><br><br>EC - FFS get an avatar pls, I like how he pushed me for not explaining in detail with Hawk. <br>Gerry - Doesn't post much, but I don't think that scum would be so obvious<br>Lil Uzi - Posts don't contain much but every once in a while he posts something good, like post #287<br>Hawk - I don't really see where he fell off, can someone help explain that too me?<br>Chaos - I agree with others saying he tried to derail Sheep's wagon<br>Penguin - Not much to say with him only having 6 posts.<br><br><span style=\"color: #BF0000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Sheep- Don't really like how his response to frog was mostey questions, and then called out frog for being scum by not answering said questions. <br>Lowell - HIs post counteracts itself when he said that he likes AJ because he is a lurker but when he posts his reads are spot on, but AJ called him scum earlier.</span></span></div></blockquote><br>- Why is Gerry so much higher than Penguin here? Reasoning for each would seem to indicate they'd be next to each other.<br>- Look at how he townreads Tereta and EC for pushing him. He doesn't challenge them for being wrong, it's like how he tried to resolve the same issue with frogger, say their play is pro-town and hope they leave him alone.<br>- So Lowell is supposedly his biggest scumread, yet the reasoning for it is so lame. It's nothing but a slip that other people had talked about prior.<br><br>Also, Terata's case in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8824386#p8824386\">460</a> is good and I agree with all of it.

I also had a problem with how he tries to take credit for coming up with certain reads that he clearly sheeped from others in the thread. If he said he sheeped them it would be completely fine, but he talks like he thought them up himself. Specifically the one about Lowell slipping about AJ's reads but also a little about the Sheep read, which was summarized with what problems other's have had with Sheep all game (and this is after he read the posts \"over and over\").<br><br>He made sure to point out someone who had done less pro-town things than he has (gerry) which mafia loves to do when they feel they're getting pressure even though there are towns not showing towniness. And he KEPT saying he's having the same null/townread about Gerry which he had for the same reason as earlier that had been called out by BOTH gerry and frogg, who you're still saying pointed out the initial slip. He just won't back down from his initial statement even though it's clearly wrong, and that's much more scummy than being wrong in the first place in this scenario. Also, why would he even say Gerry's been contributing less than he has if he's still null-townreading gerry? Seems like standard shade to me.<br><br>Last but not least i dislike in what form he gives his Naomi read. He says it like \"I also think Lowell is wrong on Naomi...\" as to shade Lowell (his scumread) for being wrong on a town, which seems like a tmi read to me if i've ever seen one. That read just doesn't come naturally to you to call Lowell wrong in your case on him if you don't know the alignment of the person being read.

But this post is in response to Chaos's. Bold words are chaos's.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Now, let's talk about why WhemeStar is obvious scum that needs to be dead like now.<br><br>In my wall response to frogger, I mentioned WhemeStar's 150, and how it read as blatant appeasement and not trying to gamesolve at all. The whole frogger-WhemeStar convo from 144 to 151 is good to look at. frogger expresses suspicion of Wheme if Sheep flips town, and Wheme seems worried about it in response, asking why in 145 and then nervously trying to figure out what frogger is scumreading him for in 148, and then the pathetic placation in 150. If Wheme was town, why the fuck would he just roll over like that and try to appease frogger as opposed to confronting him? It's like he knows he's guilty, and is just trying to be nice and fade into the background. This exchange is part of the reason I'm not sold on Sheep-scum, since I'm assuming Wheme is scum and his reaction would not have been like that if Sheep was his partner; he would just shut up and take the town-cred on a Sheep lynch.</span><br><br>You know, its really hard to get emotion right over words typed on a screen, because I wasn't nervous at all then. I was just wondering why he would suspect me because its my first normal game and I had no clue on what his reasons were. Yes, I was town reading sheep for the early part of the game, because I thought the slip on him and push on him was weak, but I didn't like his responses over time. <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">- Why is Gerry so much higher than Penguin here? Reasoning for each would seem to indicate they'd be next to each other.<br>- Look at how he townreads Tereta and EC for pushing him. He doesn't challenge them for being wrong, it's like how he tried to resolve the same issue with frogger, say their play is pro-town and hope they leave him alone.<br>- So Lowell is supposedly his biggest scumread, yet the reasoning for it is so lame. It's nothing but a slip that other people had talked about prior.<br></span><br>Because Gerry has been here all game, Penguin was late to the party. <br>I said they pushed me and others, which isn't that what a town should do? Push people even if the person their pushing may be town?<br>The slip on Sheep wasn't really a slip either, look where that got us. <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">So your opinions aren't your own thoughts?</span><br>My opinions are thoughts of others jumbled into what I like, and what I don't like. I admit I need to work with coming up with my own thoughts/ideas."}

Well it's all the things that pinged me in this post. <br>He seems super apologetic in his wordings which i haven't really seen from his previous play, an example being \"im trying my best to help town\" (talking about town as a seperate entity). I also had a problem with how he tries to take credit for coming up with certain reads that he clearly sheeped from others in the thread. If he said he sheeped them it would be completely fine, but he talks like he thought them up himself. Specifically the one about Lowell slipping about AJ's reads but also a little about the Sheep read, which was summarized with what problems other's have had with Sheep all game (and this is after he read the posts \"over and over\").<br><br>He made sure to point out someone who had done less pro-town things than he has (gerry) which mafia loves to do when they feel they're getting pressure even though there are towns not showing towniness. And he KEPT saying he's having the same null/townread about Gerry which he had for the same reason as earlier that had been called out by BOTH gerry and frogg, who you're still saying pointed out the initial slip. He just won't back down from his initial statement even though it's clearly wrong, and that's much more scummy than being wrong in the first place in this scenario. Also, why would he even say Gerry's been contributing less than he has if he's still null-townreading gerry? Seems like standard shade to me.<br><br>Last but not least i dislike in what form he gives his Naomi read. He says it like \"I also think Lowell is wrong on Naomi...\" as to shade Lowell (his scumread) for being wrong on a town, which seems like a tmi read to me if i've ever seen one. That read just doesn't come naturally to you to call Lowell wrong in your case on him if you don't know the alignment of the person being read. And disliked how he phrased \"id like to vote\" at the end.

Note: \"I say that the theory scum plan was to WK (which you did)\" see how he doesn't give a chance to discredit the idea by even beginning to think that Terata was doing anything else. If its apparently he was WK you shouldn't have to clarify because its apparent. If it isn't apparent then its your opinion that the behavior is WK, and not fact, I don't like this tone unless someone is downright denying their behavior was one thing when it could be another, and even then it's kinda scummy behavior to deal in such absolutes this early on.

Fro99ers case on sheep starts because he makes an assumption about Lowell's play and how Lowell's future play will play out. This in any case means that Sheep is already not playing well as town by his own definition. He doesn't take the time to communicate and discuss whats going on he makes assumptions about about others players play and reads them off of it. (also he entirely focuses on scum slips and things that are scummy which is fine to scum hunt but he has very few town reads from what I can tell and if he does they're very slight and he always is doubly suspicious that it may have alternative motives, Ex: Terata and later Naomi.) <br><br>Even here he doesn't take fro99ers admittance of a misunderstanding as anything town but a chance to turn the table and accuse fro99er of scummy behavior.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8815482#p8815482\" class=\"postlink\">post 188</a>, Cooperative Sheep wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8815444#p8815444\" class=\"postlink\">post 187</a>, Fro99er wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8815414#p8815414\" class=\"postlink\">post 180</a>, Cooperative Sheep wrote:</cite>@Frogger - The idea that he would never sheep does support A and B cleanly and without effort.</div></blockquote><br><img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/3oz8xLd9DJq2l2VFtu/giphy.gif\" alt=\"Image\"></div></blockquote><br>Why not though? <span class=\"noboldsig\">If someone will never sheep</span>, which means they never follow anyone elses' thoughts, they aren't cooperating ever.<br>Sure, reads might align - but they are openly stating zero cooperation unless I'm missing something.</div></blockquote><br><br>More assumptions. If someone will NEVER sheep. He opens up here that his logic makes sense if Lowell will never sheep. As town why deal that greatly in absolutes? I don't like any of this, compounded with everything Fro99er and Terata had said at the time about hsi behavior this just adds another layer of assumption to the mix in his logic. This reads to me as Close minded town playing poorly or scum trying to sound absolute about his cases and unwavering. Either way I'm okay with a lynch here like I said.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8815499#p8815499\" class=\"postlink\">post 193</a>, Cooperative Sheep wrote:</cite>The leap in logic was about lack of cooperation - I explained why it makes sense to me.

Sometimes you sheep someone. Especially in RVS. He also says that he never said it had anything to do with whether he may or may not have eventually been comfortable voting there, but your assumption was that if he's not willing to vote because its a sheep then he will be uncooperative which in of itself is a contradiction because if he may or may not eventually be okay with voting there wouldn't that at that point make him *gasp* cooperative? Like you're saying its about cooperation but if your case is built on the assumption that Lowell never sheeps therefor is uncooperative or difficult to cooperate with then your case does matter about him eventually voting one way or the other. Because he in your mind is either never sheeping meaning he has to reach conclusions of his own accord and then vote with town or never reach those conclusions and not vote cooperatively. Your logic deals in so many absolutes that it sucks. Like even if you are town (I don't think you are) your logic sucks balls.<br><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8815610#p8815610\" class=\"postlink\">post 209</a>, Cooperative Sheep wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8815510#p8815510\" class=\"postlink\">post 196</a>, Fro99er wrote:</cite>Probably scum for not even attempting to understand my play.

If AJ's points about nitpicky ness are the same as fro99er's then its not just hypocrisy but its justified here? Like you justify fro99ers case and don't deny it but instead decide to say that engaging back in the manner that you are is your only way to sort through it. Like if you understand it's a scummy way to fight back a case then maybe you need to find another way to fix it. And to your defense you do ask for suggestions for future games but to be honest there are a million ways you can engage back with fro99er rather than sit there and just go over in ridiculous detail what fro99er has said and done instead of just presenting yourself or your logic in a manner that answers his questions. Like you never take a second to just let it go you always have to have the FoS shifted in another direction other than your own. Start there.

Do you see any associative here or are you just saying within these two there is at least one scum or??<br><br>Last thing, talk to me about AJ. Like the bolded underlined comment about a slip.

I also had a problem with how he tries to take credit for coming up with certain reads that he clearly sheeped from others in the thread. If he said he sheeped them it would be completely fine, but he talks like he thought them up himself. Specifically the one about Lowell slipping about AJ's reads but also a little about the Sheep read, which was summarized with what problems other's have had with Sheep all game (and this is after he read the posts \"over and over\").<br><br>He made sure to point out someone who had done less pro-town things than he has (gerry) which mafia loves to do when they feel they're getting pressure even though there are towns not showing towniness. And he KEPT saying he's having the same null/townread about Gerry which he had for the same reason as earlier that had been called out by BOTH gerry and frogg, who you're still saying pointed out the initial slip. He just won't back down from his initial statement even though it's clearly wrong, and that's much more scummy than being wrong in the first place in this scenario. Also, why would he even say Gerry's been contributing less than he has if he's still null-townreading gerry? Seems like standard shade to me.<br><br>Last but not least i dislike in what form he gives his Naomi read. He says it like \"I also think Lowell is wrong on Naomi...\" as to shade Lowell (his scumread) for being wrong on a town, which seems like a tmi read to me if i've ever seen one. That read just doesn't come naturally to you to call Lowell wrong in your case on him if you don't know the alignment of the person being read.

On the surface it looks like just filler, but if you look and think it about it on a deeper level, he's arguable treating himself as confirmed town that shouldn't be considered for a lynch today by anyone for getting the game out of RVS as well as starting a wagon on Sheep. <br><br>Fast forward to a bit to <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8814765#p8814765\">134</a>, he does the same thing again by discrediting not only Naomi's read on him but also her as a player by bringing up a previous game without any context in which he claims he got two members of the scum team lynched.<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8814782#p8814782\">136</a> is self explanatory. <br><br>I'm inclined to believe <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8815105#p8815105\">152</a> is more scum motivated than town motivated and it only reinforces my read on him. He's hints at a PR of some sort and says he shouldn't be lynched today. There was no pressure on him at the time and the overall focus was on Sheep as well as the various arguments Frog was getting into so it was odd for him to drop that soft like it's hot and just leave. Scum have more to gain by bread crumbing in my opinion. It helps them with fake claiming and it can potential draw doctors and jail keepers to them.<br><br>TL:DR: Gerry has been been basically treating himself as confirmed town since RVS ended.<br><br>I think Gerry tried to distance from Sheep early and it sort of backfired a bit. I also think he could be just scum that tried to spread and pray on paranoia early and Sheep is town. <br><br>If we lynch Gerry today, we'll probably feel a lot better about Sheep's alignment</div></div></div></div></blockquote><br><br>LUV moves up in my townreads to join Fro99er and Naomi.

If you have a really good feeling about who could be scum and we lynch correctly today your role would prove very useful come N3 if you could make it that long but now you're never making it that far unless you're scum or we have some other god awesome PR's, the claim itself feels forced and awkward and entirely out of characteristic for someone with only a few votes on them. I understand Fro99ys hesitation to believe this. If anything it might have reinforced his vote.<br><br>PEDIT: Okay so not lynching you today is not necessarily good? If you're lying about role stopper being town this game town potentially risks you being able to hit one of our actual PR's tonight which isn't likely but still not good if we have a Cop or a Vigi with a good shot or a doc or something. I don't nesscarily want to lynch you because I don't think your play up until now has been too scummy but you have lurked a bit and haven't contributed much. I do like your reads I just want a lot more from you."}

First, my understanding of RVS is standard etiquette is to help push wagons early for reactions. This is how you get out of RVS, someone does something funny-looking (i.e. what sheep did). Secondly, specific to Uzi, he's generally lynchbait so I was interested if you knew this coming in.

Especially with the sidelining comment. Boy was I a lurker. Also note that AJ kinda was doing the same thing here except he didn't have his vote on Sheep/LUV (who I had it on first and jumped off of sheeps vote but no one seems to notice that or think my jump wasn't me directing attention even tho I explain it as such post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8814711#p8814711\">130</a> people just didn't but it I guess?)<br><br>Theres only one thing I don't like about it and thats lining up lynches! Yay lynch lining. This isn't good for winning town points from me AJ, like I can understand really digging into the Lowell/Hawk pair and if I'm not scum then Sheep is but if you're scum with Sheep this is an easy way to buy loads of loads of loads of town points here setting this up. Say I flounder and don't do well at defending myself and this lynch goes through by the end of the day (I lynch) I flip green we lynch Sheep he flips red oh looky AJ was right. Whew looks bad. Untrained eye might look good but experienced town and scum know this can look very very shady! I don't like that play by him as side from that its a pretty good post.

If so, Terata is too. From there it's just determining the third. Could still be Sheep as I mentioned originally, or perhaps Lowell attempting to veer away the vote from WhemeStar tells us something too?"}

Well it's all the things that pinged me in this post. <br>He seems super apologetic in his wordings which i haven't really seen from his previous play, an example being \"im trying my best to help town\" (talking about town as a seperate entity). I also had a problem with how he tries to take credit for coming up with certain reads that he clearly sheeped from others in the thread. If he said he sheeped them it would be completely fine, but he talks like he thought them up himself. Specifically the one about Lowell slipping about AJ's reads but also a little about the Sheep read, which was summarized with what problems other's have had with Sheep all game (and this is after he read the posts \"over and over\").<br><br>He made sure to point out someone who had done less pro-town things than he has (gerry) which mafia loves to do when they feel they're getting pressure even though there are towns not showing towniness. And he KEPT saying he's having the same null/townread about Gerry which he had for the same reason as earlier that had been called out by BOTH gerry and frogg, who you're still saying pointed out the initial slip. He just won't back down from his initial statement even though it's clearly wrong, and that's much more scummy than being wrong in the first place in this scenario. Also, why would he even say Gerry's been contributing less than he has if he's still null-townreading gerry? Seems like standard shade to me.<br><br>Last but not least i dislike in what form he gives his Naomi read. He says it like \"I also think Lowell is wrong on Naomi...\" as to shade Lowell (his scumread) for being wrong on a town, which seems like a tmi read to me if i've ever seen one. That read just doesn't come naturally to you to call Lowell wrong in your case on him if you don't know the alignment of the person being read. And disliked how he phrased \"id like to vote\" at the end.

On the surface it looks like just filler, but if you look and think it about it on a deeper level, he's arguable treating himself as confirmed town that shouldn't be considered for a lynch today by anyone for getting the game out of RVS as well as starting a wagon on Sheep. <br><br>Fast forward to a bit to <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8814765#p8814765\">134</a>, he does the same thing again by discrediting not only Naomi's read on him but also her as a player by bringing up a previous game without any context in which he claims he got two members of the scum team lynched.<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8814782#p8814782\">136</a> is self explanatory. <br><br>I'm inclined to believe <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8815105#p8815105\">152</a> is more scum motivated than town motivated and it only reinforces my read on him. He's hints at a PR of some sort and says he shouldn't be lynched today. There was no pressure on him at the time and the overall focus was on Sheep as well as the various arguments Frog was getting into so it was odd for him to drop that soft like it's hot and just leave. Scum have more to gain by bread crumbing in my opinion. It helps them with fake claiming and it can potential draw doctors and jail keepers to them.<br><br>TL:DR: Gerry has been been basically treating himself as confirmed town since RVS ended.<br><br>I think Gerry tried to distance from Sheep early and it sort of backfired a bit. I also think he could be just scum that tried to spread and pray on paranoia early and Sheep is town. <br><br>If we lynch Gerry today, we'll probably feel a lot better about Sheep's alignment</div></div></div></div></blockquote><br><br>LUV moves up in my townreads to join Fro99er and Naomi.

The second is that Lowell's posture after I stated this was to say you're scummy but not as scummy as Sheep (as seen by his vote and only FOS on you). Last, you do have a tendency to defend him subtly, specifically in your case vs sheep when you talk about cooperation and shit. And of course you being really into Wheme being town hasn't been that helpful in dissuading my feelings on this. Lowell won't even give a read on Wheme.<br><br>Definitely can't say that I understand how committal you are on Lowell. To me, he's pretty cut and dry. <br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Lowell</span><br><br>I will admit though I'm more confident on him being scum. He's blatantly just going for big wagons. <br><br>Also, Terata's actions recently are suspect. He actually has Gerry down twice in his reads, null and weak town. He's reading Lowell as town... On the same level of his read on me which is unequivocally garbage. And his Chaos read being scum leans is definitely FOTM rather than actual belief. My belief is he's trying to gauge some reads off of other people and is a bit behind on trends. <br><br>I want Fro99er to tell me what about Lowell/Terata's vote switches made him comfortable following that.

Looking at the ISO only he didn't seem to bad but you're right if I just go through the actual thread he's pretty oppurtunistic. And while I really dislike Sheep's playstyle and his earlier play that wagon seems to be going nowhere so I can agree more with this.<br><br>Terata still seems town to me even if a bit suspect but I'll reserve actual judgment for later. His argument with ECM is pretty weak. Also ECM responded very well to that pressure town points there. <br><br>Gerry pings me a lot same with Penguin because of how little they've posted.

I definitely see pro-town motive in that summary. This is my big problem with all of this. It looks like you're singing along with the melody, but you don't understand the lyrics. Post 110 that you cited has fucking nothing at all to do with Sheep's push on frogger. You said before that your opinions this game are thoughts of others jumbled into what you like.

But to answer your question my read on sheep when I posted it before was out of date, I wasn't really reading up on the game and wasn't really into it.

You see what I'm saying?<br><br> Like your use of assumptions on why Lowell does something and it relating to how he would play the game throws shade, and your playstyle to this continues to create these logical fallacies where because someone is doing something and you make an assumption to make it logical you present yourself only two options aka he's scum because scum do this and he's town because town do this.<br><br>Like right now you're assuming I cannot have town motivation for attacking you over and over for a playstyle that lacks logic. You simply close your mind off to possibilities outside your own thoughts. Lowell says something that I mean to take as he never sheeps therefor he would be uncooperative as a townie taking that mindset into the future, and it's either this or its not. No middle ground.

This makes me think that you do believe that his response was aligned to a scumread on Lowell.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>He doesn't believe what he's saying - if he did he'd be at least slightly piffed that I'm mocking it so much (check out Frogger who I actually caught misunderstanding/misrepping me - he was annoyed and quadrupled down on his beliefs - that's actual conviction and proves that no matter what I thought about the case, he believed the case.<br><br>Hawk can't be arsed.<br>He's scum.</div></blockquote><br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I will agree that your \"case\" against me is easily read as one giant vague playstyle attack that doesn't show scum intent.<br>You say 'assumption' I say 'stating an opinion' - either way neither is scummy and it's silly to treat it as such.</div></blockquote><br><br>Notice how you present two options again to defend your argument? it's fine if you don't believe that there only two options. You're smarter than that. It's not as simple as a straight False Dilemma instead you present two options and then file in a loaded question or don't explore option z.<br><br>Like right here. You say it's silly because either way you put it it's not scummy. What I'm saying is the use is scummy.<br><br>You make an \"assumption\" Present a case as X or Y until someone says Z and if they don't say Z you use that as logic. That's scummy behavior to me. Like with Frog. You presented it as either he is town with a bad habit/belief or salivating scum using a misrep. Until Frog was able to present Z  (misunderstanding) you didn't waver. And when you did you simply Rephrase him as X because that lines up with your logic making you right in that argument. You see how that's very manipulative and scummy right?<br><br>That's why I scum read you."}

Discredit the slot in a very scummy way or B. get them to slip or scumclaim so that Omega can then push a fact. And if Terata flips town, Omega doesn't have to defend his read being wrong, he can just use that justification he built as a scape-goat. Cuz Omega there isn't pushing a read, he's pushing fact."}

On the surface it looks like just filler, but if you look and think it about it on a deeper level, he's arguable treating himself as confirmed town that shouldn't be considered for a lynch today by anyone for getting the game out of RVS as well as starting a wagon on Sheep. <br><br>Fast forward to a bit to <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8814765#p8814765\">134</a>, he does the same thing again by discrediting not only Naomi's read on him but also her as a player by bringing up a previous game without any context in which he claims he got two members of the scum team lynched.<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8814782#p8814782\">136</a> is self explanatory. <br><br>I'm inclined to believe <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8815105#p8815105\">152</a> is more scum motivated than town motivated and it only reinforces my read on him. He's hints at a PR of some sort and says he shouldn't be lynched today. There was no pressure on him at the time and the overall focus was on Sheep as well as the various arguments Frog was getting into so it was odd for him to drop that soft like it's hot and just leave. Scum have more to gain by bread crumbing in my opinion. It helps them with fake claiming and it can potential draw doctors and jail keepers to them.<br><br>TL:DR: Gerry has been been basically treating himself as confirmed town since RVS ended.<br><br>I think Gerry tried to distance from Sheep early and it sort of backfired a bit.

He does describes why tho, but that's not really a slip. While I do agree Sheep was scummy here, Garrybote is scum pushing a \"slip\" that's not actually a \"slip\" Part of the reason why I SR chaos currently is that with 341 (I think that's what the post was) he was looking for a slip to push. Scum like having a justified vote. Garrybote would then push this \"slip\" that isn't actually a slip, and then if Sheep flipped town, Garrybote will then use the justification he built as a scape-goat.<br><br>152 is him softing a PR. We'll keep this for later, but right now it's coming across as \"Hey, I'm scum, allow me to soft a PR so that people will be scared to lynch me and I can do fuck all hahahaha\"<br><br>333 is him backing off of a \"slip\" he was pushing. He knows what he was pushing was not a \"slip\" The backpedal here is scummy as fuck. He unvotes him but still think's he's scum that wants him lynched? nononono. This is not town behavoir.<br><br>535 is him just saying \"You're wrong.\" He doesn't attempt to make a rebuttal, he just discredits it as \"wrong\"<br>541 is him just throwing shit out there to make himself look like he's doing things. He's not doing things.<br>568 is misrepresentation. Rolestopper's can be townaligned. He's saying \"It's usually a scum role\" so people will go jump on Wheme and get Wheme mislynched.<br><br>741 is an even further backpedal from sheep. Went from being a big scumread because they \"slipped\" to \"Eh, they won't get lynched today but they're still scum\" to \"They aren't that scummy?\" Yeah no, their sheep read is fake as fuck.<br><br>960 he doesn't even have a TR. More like, he can't fake one! hahahaha! People have been townie. He's just chosing to ignore those slots.<br>965 is \"OMGAWD I'M A PR, LET ME SHOVE IT IN YOUR FACE, DON'T LYNCH ME BECAUSE I'M A PR\"<br>976 is just him trying to throw more shade at Wheme's claim.<br><br>1000 is a really manipulative question. It's basicly suggesting \"If you answer yes, your slot get's descreditted; if you answer no, you're scummy.\" I mean, I asked Garrybote what would a yes answer mean to him and what a no answer would mean to him but he jumped on me instead of anwsering the question? This is scum trying to blatantly be manipulative and get away with it.<br><br>1004 is just throwing more words and looks like panicked scum because I caught them.<br><br>1005 is him basicly saying \"Eh, I scumread a slot, I'm pretty sure that Alisae replaced the previous slot holder, but I'm too lazy to check.\" If you're too lazy to check then your scumread on them is not in good faith. It's faked and in bad faith.<br><br>1017 says \"I'm too lazy to push you\" more like \"My scumread is fake and fabricated and I can't push you without making it look scummy.\" If his scumread on my slot was in good faith and was real he would be pushing me, not halfassing his scumread on me.<br><br>Overall Garrybote is manipulative, coasting scum who has no real conviction in his pushes."}

The circumstances around wheme's claim are the worst (he was under pressure), but hawk's backing makes it slightly better for me. Chaos' claim didn't come under pressure (IIRC), nor did gerry's, so they look better IMO.

His only obsession seems to be hassling people who vote wheme.

What reason do scum have to bus their mates in ANY game? It buys them longevity, it cuts ties with a mate they feel is a detriment to their team, and in some cases it earns them blind and stupid trust from others for what will probably be long enough for them to win.

Whoever he targets becomes ascetic and makes me unable to track them. Assuming you're town as well, that is two investigative roles that a rolestopper can fuck with. Not to mention a third town PR that would have a decent chance of getting an investigative if they didn't die early.

It could be ECM is a ninja (will freely admit this is fueled by conf bias because I think he is scum...although if he does flip ninja, I think that clears Wheme as town? No way scum would have a ninja and rolestopper). I don't really have any good theories on the NK, to be honest. It could be one of the two remaining members has a good foothold in the town and ECM sat home twiddling his thumbs while his partner made the kill. Or Wheme killed instead of using the rolestopper (probably should have targeted Wheme...will agree I made a misplay there)."}

Our roles don't go well together, true, but it is possible that there's a town investigative combined with a town rolestopper, it's just negative utility.

It's kind of been on auto-pilot for me since Alisae's fake result.<br><br>For my part I will say this.  If there is a 1v1 situation that early in the game pitting a claimed PR against a VT...I'm going to opt for believing the claim.  Even if the claim was a lie (as it turned out to be)...town was still setting themselves up to be rid of the 2nd mafia member the following day and still in possession of two chances to get the last mafia member.  Those are not bad odds.  I will say in hindsight it might have been better to let D3 last a little longer and grill Alisae about their claim but in my case at least...I can be a bit impatient when my mind is made up.<br><br><br>with regards to my current reads:<br><br>Lowell - Lowell was my alternative to Sheep D1.  I didn't care for Sheep but that wagon was going nowhere so I swapped to Lowell in part for OMGUS retaliation.  Looking back I am doubtful that Sheep would bus Lowell so adamently D1, up to L-2 a few times, without trying to move things elsewhere.  Of my four remaining reads Lowell is probably the one I'm most confident is town based on VCA and counter wagon to Sheep.<br><br>Terata is a bit of an enigma in my  mind this game.  Seems like she has had a few stretches where she has been absent.  Also, she hasn't made a vote since D1 so VCA is not that telling on her.  She did initiate the final wagon on Sheep D1...when she could have easily hopped on tbd!me, town!Wheme or tbd!Lowell.  So on what little VCA that does apply to her she appears to be a town lean.<br><br>That leaves me with IAI and Unknown.<br><br>IAI replaced ECMitchell who was focused for the bulk of D1 and all D2 on getting rid of Wheme.  ECM never voted otes on Alisae or Sheep.  Alisae however on D2 did vote ECM with conviction (up to L-1).  Not sure if this is a pass for ECM as Alisae was sheeping Frogger heavily during the game and Frogger had just voted ECM prior to Alisae's vote.  But it looks better than if Alisae had totally ignored ECM.<br><br>Unknown...replaced LUV mid-D1.  Luv had done some light voting (bussing?) on Sheep D1.  Unknown entered the game and chose to vote me (a negative fmpov) and hammered Sheep.  Hammering scum is good.  Hammering scum when it is a foregone conclusion scum is going to be lynched...not as good.  But at least not bad.  D2..Unknown put the Chaos mislynch wagon at L-2 two posts before Froger hammered.  D3...Unknown chose to ignore Alisae's claim and vote Alisae.  D4 Unknown voted Alisae.  Then opens up D5 with a vote/unvote on me.<br><br>WRT the D3 Frogger and D4 Alisae lynches...I'm of the opinion that scum would try to avoid supporting the Frogger lynch (knowing it would be a mislynch) and would support the auto-lynch of Alisae D4.  Unknown fits this belief the strongest (voted Alisae both D3&amp;4).  Followed by IAI (absent D3...voted Alisae D4) and Terata (no votes either day).<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">tl:dr;</span>  I think Unknown looks the worst from a VCA standpoint followed by IAI, Terata and then Lowell.<br><br>I still want to look over Sheep and Alisae's ISOs, along with the living, and see if anything jumps out at me.<br><br>If I was going to vote now it would be on Unknown."}

This conclusion just seems too pat for any number of reasons.  First, why would a town player just casually elimate 2/4 players from the lynch pool given that we presumably have two lynches left?<br><br>Second, it VERY much looks like he's dying to pocket me. I have been saying from the beginning that AT LEAST one scum must be off the sheep wagon. So who does gerry's death benefit then?  There are now only two players off the wagon (IaI and fitz) and two chances to lynch. If scum were one of those two, why wouldn't they kill off terata or me or Unknown in order to keep the number of non-sheep-bussing lynchable candidate pool higher? As it is, if I follow through with my plan of assuming both scum didn't wagon, I'm left with--surprise!--the same lynch pool as Unknown.<br><br>Also, in #1966 (I lost the link), Unknown says that if Ali is scum, fitz probably isn't.

My feeling at the time, and up until the dawn of today, was that there was AT MOST one busser on sheep's wagon.  The reasoning here was that, given daytalk, they could have easily swayed the lynch to me if there were two of them on sheep's wagon.  Put a pin in that...<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8877176#p8877176\" class=\"postlink\">post 1498</a>, Unknown1234 wrote:</cite>Wow, I lived.</div></blockquote><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8877186#p8877186\" class=\"postlink\">post 1499</a>, Unknown1234 wrote:</cite>Havingfitz was very determined to discourage my hammer vote and attempted to get me to switch to Lowell.....<br><br>Hmmm....</div></blockquote><br>Both of these I've mentioned.  They're suspicious as hell LAMIST posts.  They make no sense from a town POV.  No one in a 13-player game should say \"wow, I lived\" after N1. Even if Unknown was the single driving force for the sheep wagon (he wasn't), it reeks of faux surprise.<br><br>So then Ali claims guilty result on frogger. Obvious 1v1.

VT v. powerrole, lynch the VT first. Where does Unknown's confidence that Ali was pulling an insane gambit come from?  While most ppl were thinking \"what the hell would Ali have to gain by lying to kill a VT,\" Unknown seemed to know ali was lying.  Only, he doesn't really explain this in a way that would give anyone else a reason to jump from the frogger wagon.  Just sort of distances himself from the frogger lynch.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8933001#p8933001\" class=\"postlink\">post 2002</a>, Unknown1234 wrote:</cite>Y'all are dumb as fuck.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Alisae</span></div></blockquote><br>And the payoff. He could easily have pushed this earlier if had reasons.

This conclusion just seems too pat for any number of reasons.  First, why would a town player just casually elimate 2/4 players from the lynch pool given that we presumably have two lynches left?<br><br>Second, it VERY much looks like he's dying to pocket me. I have been saying from the beginning that AT LEAST one scum must be off the sheep wagon. So who does gerry's death benefit then?  There are now only two players off the wagon (IaI and fitz) and two chances to lynch. If scum were one of those two, why wouldn't they kill off terata or me or Unknown in order to keep the number of non-sheep-bussing lynchable candidate pool higher? As it is, if I follow through with my plan of assuming both scum didn't wagon, I'm left with--surprise!--the same lynch pool as Unknown.<br><br>Also, in #1966 (I lost the link), Unknown says that if Ali is scum, fitz probably isn't.  So what changed?</div></blockquote><br><br>Everything in this post except the last post is being read as I'm confirmed scum. You aren't assuming what I would do if I'm Town, which makes no sense to do.<br><br>I die a lot on my site n1 and n2 due to being almost always around and actively participating. I'll admit that it took me some time to get used to things on another site, so that probably wasn't something I should have expected. That being said, no clue why this part makes sense as a scum play so I want to hear you explain this.<br><br>I already explained my obvious stand point, and it clearly doesn't correspond how you people play. I don't rely as much on night actions, and so if I had a super strong scum read and someone I was suspicious about right out of the get go, no way I'm believing a lead. If you are going to find it scummy how my play differs, then that's how it's going to be. Most reads are based on my regular play.<br><br>Again, if you believe I'm scum that's been trying way too hard to look Town all game, then you should really look again. I wasn't going to vote Frogger, and Alisae was always going to be my vote because I didn't believe the claim. I've seen worse gambits.<br><br>Last post is where you don't make sense. Sure, I went into the day expecting to agree with Frogger and lynch both of those players like he wanted to. However, if it wasn't obvious to you I have been back tracking on what I said and have been considering other people. I still wouldn't be surprised if scum were still in both of them, but I have been reconsidering. I don't see why you think I'm specifically pocketing you, because I actually haven't even addressed you yet or been forcing anyone to death. You also seem to think I'm the one that has been \"pocketing\" the most, which I disagree with.<br><br>Lastly, it is obvious how my Havingfitz read changed. He wasn't able to slightly consider any Town motivation in my posts and said that everything I've done has been scummy. You don't even question that do you? You guys play so much weirder than I do."}

I've read through all pages up until this point, and I do have some general reads. First, I want to say that I deliberately skipped reading Naomi's introduction post the moment I realized what it was. No offense, Naomi, but if you start all of your games that way, I'd very quickly want to avoid playing with you. It's an excuse in advance of scummy behavior; despite it likely being honest, the fact is, if your behavior is scummy regardless of alignment, you're still a detriment to town. Rather than attempting to safeguard your defensiveness from the start\u2014hoping it serves to keep you in the game longer\u2014I recommend learning to evolve your play style so as to not appear scummy, regardless of alignment. The \"Green\" vs. \"Red\" clarification is helpful, though, so thank you for that.<br><br>Fro99er, you certainly have an abrasive play style. Not something I appreciate, but likely something I can get use to. Voiding your posts of connotations, I generally agree with your sentiments, up until now at least. You are parroting your defense of comparing Cooperative Sheep to Axel from another game, however, which is coming across as slightly desperate. Despite some pressure coming off of Cooperative Sheep, you still seem very committed to going after them.

Terata's responses throughout have also rubbed me the wrong way, particularly how he appearingly defended Cooperative Sheep in saying, \"It's likely you just handle your defense awkwardly, regardless of alignment.\" Shortly after, though, he joined in on the pressure on Cooperative Sheep, flat-out calling him scum.

I got super busy IRL and again im multitabling like a moron in a faster game. But im not gonna say more on that, cuz it's pointless.<br><br>So, some thoughts.<br><br>I'm never gonna vote Lowell this game, ever. The reason i caught sheep was because i thought Lowell felt town and i went looking for scum on that Wagon and sheep was the least towny one. I just don't ever see things playing out like they did if Lowell's scum.<br><br>I still think the things i wrote about Sheep's comments on the unknown slot was pretty w/v-looking / spewy. And i think Unknowns way of handling this day has felt the towniest. Others have only been making cases made to convince others to lynch specific people while unknown has actually tried to have a conversation with people and evaluating them. Their way of swapping slowly from thinking i was town to re-isoing and finding things they disliked to still suspecting others felt VERY real to me. Also maybe im stupid but im buying the stuff about them not knowing about scum's day-chat and from feeling unknown out from reading their posts, i don't think they're a player to try to clear themselves from something that stupid. So im locking in them as town too.<br><br>So for me the path from here is pretty easy. just lynch fitz/IAI, and be done with it. But i know im a suspect so it isn't that easy.<br><br>Ok, so the biggest reason (from what i've precieved) to why IAI says im scum is that \"Alisae wouldn't have made the fakeclaim if the partner is in the back-then-suspects\". This is terrible logic. Scum KNOWS people evaluate their play after they die, so saying that Alisae and her partner didn't even think about how his claim would look after the flip is just beyond bad. Since scum would know for sure this logic would be taken up, if not by themselves (if you're scum) it will be taken up by the town (if someone else is the last scum). Right now im leaning SLIGHTLY more towards fitz, simply because you have focused so little on preparing the second mislynch after me if you're scum, and you're gonna look pretty bad when i flip town. This is wifom too of course and you could totally be scum doing this, but the way you swapped your second suspect in the span of 1 page felt like a move that scum perhaps wouldn't make if they're focused on getting me lynched.<br><br>But regardless, if im scum, and Frogg is harddefending me for the rest of the game, WHY would you fakeclaim a red on FROGG OF ALL PEOPLE that will lead you straight to the win. That no1 has taken this up yet is weirding me out.<br><br>So yeah, Lowell town, unknown town, 1 of fitz and IAI scum, leaning fitz."}

And Fitz started arguing with someone (you i think?) after sheep was lynched about how bad it was that sheep was lynched.

Just kinda slipped it in there.<br><br>And even though he has felt like he believes the push, he's also said that \"it's possible im wrong, this is why blablabla\" when he was talking to you earlier. And i don't think his questioning of me has reflected that. He's \"asked\" his question in a way that already feels decided, more like a case than wanting to know the answers from me. And the very last post from him today reflected that thought i had aswell. He had a chance to ask me for stuff and the thing he said was \"would you say this is how scum would deal with their partners?\" or something like that, implying im supposed to call myself scum (if i interpreted the question right). Just feelt wrong.<br><br>The reason why i suspected Fitz first was that i didn't remember the interactions from Naomi with Sheep and his way of handing sheep post-hammer and that he has felt kind of on the sidelines a big part of today. And his case on you felt bad aswell. Tbh i think it could be both of them but im leaning IAI"}

Right now im leaning SLIGHTLY more towards fitz, simply because you have focused so little on preparing the second mislynch after me if you're scum, and you're gonna look pretty bad when i flip town.

So even though i think it would usually look good for Choas it gives me distancy vibes.

EC was in the thread a lot and actually played the game. Sheep did too. So it would've made sense for it to be at least some discussion both were involved in.

This is terrible logic. Scum KNOWS people evaluate their play after they die, so saying that Alisae and her partner didn't even think about how his claim would look after the flip is just beyond bad. Since scum would know for sure this logic would be taken up, if not by themselves (if you're scum) it will be taken up by the town (if someone else is the last scum). Right now im leaning SLIGHTLY more towards fitz, simply because you have focused so little on preparing the second mislynch after me if you're scum, and you're gonna look pretty bad when i flip town.

ECM never voted otes on Alisae or Sheep.  Alisae however on D2 did vote ECM with conviction (up to L-1).

Hammering scum when it is a foregone conclusion scum is going to be lynched...not as good.  But at least not bad.  D2..Unknown put the Chaos mislynch wagon at L-2 two posts before Froger hammered.

Then opens up D5 with a vote/unvote on me.<br><br>WRT the D3 Frogger and D4 Alisae lynches...I'm of the opinion that scum would try to avoid supporting the Frogger lynch (knowing it would be a mislynch) and would support the auto-lynch of Alisae D4.

Thanks for answering my question. I may have been hopped up on cold meds last night but I didn't think the case on sheep was that strong so I didn't mind switching my vote to get some response and shake up some people.<br><br> Tho personally I don't see what's so scummy as jumping off a wagon and onto another to get some engagement and conversation. It's d1. And early too. I want lots of people talking today not just tunnel on sheep :/<br><br>Also why Gerry? If you thought Sheep's slip was something substantial wouldn't that mean you're inclined to town read Gerry since he was implying that Gerry is town?<br><br>Pedit: ^ What Fro99er said. Though Im still only partially sold on it being a legit slip. I can easily see this as being a misnomer.

Just because you agree with someone doesn't mean you think they're town. I know people won't follow me on to him because Sheep is basically telling himself but that's fine. We can get Gerry tomorrow or even now to put me at ease if the rest of you are town reading him. <br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: </span><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Sheep</span></div></blockquote><br><br>Interesting string of posts.

On the surface it looks like just filler, but if you look and think it about it on a deeper level, he's arguable treating himself as confirmed town that shouldn't be considered for a lynch today by anyone for getting the game out of RVS as well as starting a wagon on Sheep. <br><br>Fast forward to a bit to <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8814765#p8814765\">134</a>, he does the same thing again by discrediting not only Naomi's read on him but also her as a player by bringing up a previous game without any context in which he claims he got two members of the scum team lynched.<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8814782#p8814782\">136</a> is self explanatory. <br><br>I'm inclined to believe <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8815105#p8815105\">152</a> is more scum motivated than town motivated and it only reinforces my read on him. He's hints at a PR of some sort and says he shouldn't be lynched today. There was no pressure on him at the time and the overall focus was on Sheep as well as the various arguments Frog was getting into so it was odd for him to drop that soft like it's hot and just leave. Scum have more to gain by bread crumbing in my opinion. It helps them with fake claiming and it can potential draw doctors and jail keepers to them.<br><br>TL:DR: Gerry has been been basically treating himself as confirmed town since RVS ended.<br><br>I think Gerry tried to distance from Sheep early and it sort of backfired a bit.

In 1940 Frogger called me, terata, and unknown town and was pretty vocal about it.  Unknown's behavior towards frogger was off, tonally, though.

Gerry was one of the people NOT on the sheep wagon D1, and several ppl were operating under the notion that sheep wouldn't have TWO bussers on his wagon.
