It's not just that I have seen town and scum do it, but I can think of only one game where the alignment of a IC has even been questioned outside of a jokey fashion (and that was a large theme uPick game where some people suspected the mod of being bastardly).

I can understand that there are, in some situations, some players who as town like to hold cards to their chest, or don't play as transparently as others, but if I ask someone a question and they ignore me, my first thought isn't \"oooh this guys got a plan\", it's \"What is he hiding from us, and why would he do that?\" And the answer to both of those questions is \"Maybe he's scum.\" It especially doesn't make sense to me on Page 2 of Day 1, there's no way there's some overarching plan of his that he's fulfilling by dodging the most basic of questions.<br>\n<br>\nWhy do you townread Acryon?

What did you townread her (him? female avatar going with her until corrected) for?

If you can't tell us what those posts were, then you're just townreading someone without reason, and that might be buddying, or it might be pretending to have reads when you don't, and when you think about it, it sounds like crap.

Policy lynches are a benefit to town because it eliminates players that we are unable to get reads on in normal fashions due to the fact that they don&#8217;t play in a normal way. The reason that lynch all lurkers/liars is a thing is because 1. Lurkers need to be socialized so they stop fucking lurking. 2. Liars need to be lynched because they can no longer be trusted. 3.

You do not clarify at all, and just give a somewhat off topic answer and leave me to believe that you voted for acryon based off his dislike of you not doing rvs. Later you rail against me for misinterpreting why you voted. Maybe if you answered questions asked of you this wouldn&#8217;t happen. And if you choose to not answer questions, don&#8217;t put it on the questioner for not understanding. I do think it is funny that you use quoting a post as a reason that I should have understood something when you have quoted many of my posts but not figured out what the fuck I was looking for from you. And then you have to be called out by acryon for not being on me, say that you were worried about OMGUS and voted me. Weak sauce brother, weak sauce. #121 is a blatant attempt to preemptively discredit me. I don&#8217;t even know where you would have gotten the idea that you know how good of a player I am or what I can do in regards to scumhunting. I can&#8217;t find a completed game with you in it, and doubt you have dove into my games to see what I can do. #197, im sure you do like vote parking on me. You do know that even if you were right (psstt&#8230; you&#8217;re not) that I wouldn&#8217;t be the only scum left out there. Mini normals usually have a 3 man scum team, you feel like finding any of them, or are you good with just me? Don&#8217;t think I really need to wait for an answer, its doubtful you will be looking for anyone else, hate to lock in your needed mislynches this early.<br>\n<br>\n@Toon- Did you read before you made post #78 with your rvs vote? I don&#8217;t see much analysis from your catch up post, more just a commentary. I&#8217;m also looking forward to see if you give a shit about people answering the few questions you asked. Your reads are pretty pedestrian. The reluctance to put someone you are scum reading close to a lynch is questionable as well. If Thor was here he would be advocating a wagon going to l-1 as quickly as possible to get the best reads from the reactions. If you think someone is scum vote them, you can get reads based off what happens next. How is pushing someone you are scumreading a bad thing for town? How would it be different in a few days time?<br>\n<br>\nRe: Copper and the IC stuff. Even if he missed the part where RC was confirmed town you can still talk about agreeing with confirmed town and mean it. I played a game where we had an IC and his reads were so fucking off that it ruined the game because of how insistent he was with them and the fact that he was confirmed town so we should listen. Confirmed town can have shit reads because they only know their own. Being confirmed does nothing for being accurate. Do I think that Copper is on the level with missing the announcement, sure, I wouldn&#8217;t have seen it myself if I hadn&#8217;t gone back and read from the beginning. Shit, most of the time I just go back to my last post of content when I reread. Now I just need to figure out if Victor thought he had legit figured something out or if this is one of those times where scum picks up on a minute thing and blows it way out of proportion to push a bad read.<br>\n<br>\n(an aside: I really hate it when people talk about how well they play as scum and how they are incapable of being scum this game because they would be playing better as scum. I just hate listening to people toot their own horns like that.)<br>\n<br>\n@Futan- what did you mean that Boon is baiting my questions? You say that scum wouldn&#8217;t do things that would invite discussion, but scum do that every game. Pushes based off bad intel, bussing, night kills, bad motivation, wifom. All of those things are ways that scum can mess with town to screw us up. And I doubly don&#8217;t care about things that people point out themselves as being reasons to not scum read them. &#8220;No guys, I totes can&#8217;t be scum because of that, as scum there is no way that I would do that.&#8221; Fuck that shit.<br>\n<br>\n@Copper- I would appreciate if you don&#8217;t call my view point retarded. You can disagree and voice that, but you don&#8217;t have my experience and you don&#8217;t think the way that I do, so I will give you a pass on that first one. If you do it again I will probably burn you to the fucking ground. And don&#8217;t think I didn&#8217;t notice the subtle discredit towards what I have to say by attacking my scumhunting. You say that Monkey seemed annoyed/disinterested in regards to my line of questioning. Do you feel like that was an appropriate way for him to feel based off the questions I was asking, or do you feel like that was off? I glazed over when you are VDA started going at it again. I don&#8217;t see this as scum theater, so you guys both being scum is out. Anything else is yet to be determined.<br>\n<br>\n@Eek- what parts do you disagree with? I don&#8217;t get the beetlejuice tell on Elb at all.<br>\n<br>\n@Boon- Im pretty sure you have your reads backwards. Monkey is the scum and VDA is the guy who is tilting at windmills.<br>\n<br>\n@SiX- im giving you one more chance to play this game before I just tunnel into your ass and make sure you are gone regardless of what alignment you are. I have had too many games where scum has just lurkfucked their way into obscurity by staying out of the main discussion and avoiding any sort of heat. If you guys weren&#8217;t sure where I lie with policy lynches, this should leave no question. #180, so you&#8217;ve read through, congratulations! Reading is half the battle in this game. Now to your analysis of what you read. What? There isn&#8217;t any? What do you mean, like he didn&#8217;t post much, just a few questions or observations? No. Nothing? The fuck you mean he didn&#8217;t get it? Oh Jesus Horatio Christ. Pick something, anything and talk to someone about it you lackluster slot waster. Talk to Monkey about his RVS views. Talk to Acryon about not going after Boon. Talk to me about Monkey. Talk to RC about how nice it is to be able to play this game without the paranoia coming from everyone and having to prove to them she is town. You have nothing?<br>\n<br>\n@Cheetory- hello sir, welcome aboard.<br>\n<br>\nElbs #148 seems town to me. I can follow his line of thought, while not agreeing with all of it (namely the acryon thing again, but I digress). You have a throwaway line shot towards acryon about defending Boon, are you insinuating they are scum together, or that acryon is scum white knighting townBoon or what?<br>\n<br>\nWhat in the blue fuck is page 9?<br>\n-Boon, VDA is town Monkey is scum. And what do you mean that you are changing your rvs vote? I don&#8217;t see VDAs post as fluff, so I would request that you explain exactly what you are describing here. And I don&#8217;t think their interactions points to VDA scum here. Im just not following you here.<br>\n- Copper wagon gets a few votes (Not sure where Elb came from on this, know that Monkey is sheeping, but why hop off me?)<br>\n- Serious lol at confidence being a townreadable thing from Monkey. I&#8217;m confident as fuck, but scum in his eyes.

If you can read 110 posts and find something in them to talk about then you are not trying. And policy lynches benefit town because they remove questionable people from the game that scum would be able to push for mislynches later in the game.

Real alignments are currently unknown) who have been going at it all game. They cross vote because they have become convinced that the other is scum and you are just lurky low hanging mislynch bait.

If you'd consult my meta, you'd notice that I have a strong history of staying fairly neutral and then tunneling people on a hairpin once I've accumulated enough evidence or see a smoking gun. I even used to have a habit of fakeclaiming cop whenever I really want to push a read, but guess what? once I reached that point I've never been wrong, and in general my town winrate both on this website and outside it has been quite stellar, in no small part due to my scumhunting ability.

RC, I've played with you once I think and that was towards the beginning of my career here. If you are able to succinctly push your scum reads and have the foundations for them securely set then I don't think there is an issue. People are going to take shots at you the same as any other townie because you are fallible with your reads whether you are confirmed or not.

Victor on the other hand says that Copper is attempting to buddy with a Townie. Although not mentioning this, it could also be considered as a past experience. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Scum buddies town, Copper buddies Town. Therefore Copper equals scum.</div><br>\n<br>\nIf we follow Copper's lead on Victor being scum, then it'd be ignorant to not consider Copper also as being scum. But since both of you're doubtfully scum it'd mean that either are you both town or one of you is scum. But because the arguement both of you put forth holds equal weight, It's not possible to consider one scum and leave the other out. Therefore the logical conclusion would be that if not both are scum (Unless schemed) and a specific scum can't be concluded both of you are likely to be town <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">for now</div>.<br>\n<br>\nSo @RadiantCowBells I'd like to know why you consider Victor a very solid lynch although what he brings forth is equal to Copper's.<br>\n<br>\nAnd in case both of you're Town, who here hasn't seen what's currently going on (Page 11-13) about 2 later revealed town members making wallsposts arguing about why they are correct. Therefore I aswell judge this scenario based on my experience. Granted, I dismissed completely your current arguements about why you're correct and why the other one is incorrect since what was of importance to me as it's origin. But if you wish to debate my conclusion here, go ahead and explain to me why you consider yourself correct without being just as suspicious yourself.<br>\n<br>\nAlso, I haven't seen you active since post 7 (Although I myself probably am not one to talk).<br>\nHowever, please show you're still here by providing your train of thoughts.

Seems to be looking at things like town would, or at the very least in a level-headed manner, which is at least not anti-town.  <br>\n<br>\nVictor/Copper - I think one is scum.  Again, this one is tough because I have only played with each of them as scum before, so my perspective is skewed a little more than I'd like on both of them.  I think Victor is the more likely of the two, because the angles of attack and tunneling he's doing are <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">very</div> reminiscent of the scum-play I've seen from him.  The only thing that bugs me is that all of his scum-reads have/had some traction of their own, and he doesn't strike me as the type to play that way as scum, although admittedly that is mostly gut.  Copper's defensiveness isn't great, but I'm not sure it's worse than Victor's tunneling.  I don't think there's anything to glean from IC-gate.  It doesn't feel like that would be his game, but I'm also not going to completely rule it out, so it's a null at this point.<br>\n<br>\nFutan - If I had a gun put to my head, I would say he is scum, and his posts seem very active lurking-ish.

This is a bigger point, when defending himself he has attempted to create strawman arguments to defend. For instance, in response to my vote he claimed that I was accusing him of trying a <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6541885#p6541885\">high-risk, gambit</a> (neither claim related to anything in my posting), so he could then proceed to argue that <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6541916#p6541916\">he was too good as scum to do such a thing</a>. <br>\n<br>\n3) Refusal to build his case against me. He is scumreading me and voting me <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">but</div> he is never really tried to drive a case home. Particularly when accusing me of something he is not backing it up proof. You can actually clearly see this in his case, where he links a lot of own posts talking about scummy stuff I've supposedly done, but the only actual point he link to my positng is my defences of Elbirn (which is probably the least scummy thing he's accursing me of).

My definition of buddying is irrelevant, what is relevant is Victor's stated belief: Copper a)knew Radiant was IC and b) decided to buddy her as scum, and the questions he asks me, the two don't match, as you said if you think I did that as scum then you try and figure out why I did it, instead he dismisses the fact the I buddied a known player, never backtracks on his idea that I knew from the start, when it would fit his belief much more if I just blundered and decided to buddy a player that was actually confirmed, there is no updating his reads or ideas based on the conversation, he instead just plows on trying to scumread me, that does not make sense for a townie, it does for scum if your game plan is to pick someone you think did something scummy (like missing the info on the IC) and proceed 1v1 him for the rest of D1 to show the rest of town you are scumhunting, he also already lined up Acryon as a possible lynch tomorrow, where I to flip, by saying he may be WKing me.<br>\n<br>\n2. Possible but unlikely, it's not about how abrasive you are, it's about how close minded he is and about how the most important thing for him is trying to show Copper is scum which again doesn't make sense as town, this is not some sort of cc battle where a townie would know he is playing against scum.

On the other hand if Copper flips scum it is less likely Acryon would be.

Toon has far too comfortable sitting in the background toDay and he's my number two scumread at this point (and frankly Copper's scumflip wouldn't affect that read one iota). Acryon <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6558344#p6558344\">411</a> gave the impression of scum looking to push through two lynches in quick succession, so if Copper was town, he is definately someone to look into for that. On the other hand if Copper flips scum it is less likely Acryon would be.

I think that scum can tunnel because most people usually attribute that to a town style of play. How many times have you seen someone dismissed as most likely town \"because they continue a push where scum probably would have backed off.\" I've seen it a bunch of times and have tunneled myself as scum (flying aces as messiah complex day 1 against jiffy). I think the same thing could be said about the person flitting from one read to the other. This easily gets dismissed as attempts to scumhunt and looking active. I think in this case you need to look at the actual pushes and the consistency involved there.<br>\n<br>\nI don't like when people say they never do something as scum. I never bus. I never vote my buddies in rvs, I never make pushes I wouldn't make as town. There is nothing you shouldn't do as scum to try and win. Good scum changes their approach and activities all the time to avoid being easily detected. This is why I think that while meta might give you some clues you really need to evaluate what you have right in front of you. I swore up and down Boon was scum last game (Ninja) because he acted scummy. I know his meta to be town when he does the things he does, but it doesn't change the fact that I read him as scum when he does those things.

He was rather...Meek, unassuming, I feel. He was active-lurky and could have been mislynch potential for scum. He was pretty null. Reading his ISO all I can really glean is that he was the only person opposed to a Monkey wagon (scratch that, early on he was opposed, later he voted him), and he seemed to be scumreading Toon and Boon, and in one of his final posts he called me scummy.

You do appear to be setting Cheet up for a lynch candidate. You point out that he is buddying the IC and that when you call him on it he overreacts. It also appears that you are voting Toon because he blatantly sheeped the IC when RC made it clear that it was Toon or Elb today.

I really like the conviction here.  while I can look at it and do think it was a bit of an overreaction, I think in this case it's more likely to come from indignated town whose playstyle is mostly centered around trying to outyell FF and make him look worse as opposed to presenting logic-based arguments.  I also think that early game, making strong pushes is the best way to move the game forward and create new content, and I don't think scum would put themselves so far out there so quickly for (as far as I could tell) no reason.  I look at this and think it's more likely to come from town who legitimately think they're onto something as opposed to scum pushing any kind of agenda.  there are also some parallels here to the previous game I played with him; I can confirm MM tends to dislike when people push more strongly than what he perceives as necessary in RVS, and I can confirm that he does this regardless of how much of a reach his own reasons for pushing people are.<br>\n<br>\nnow, this isn't much of a tell on its own, but it is the first part of a long series of posts that I think are more likely to come from a town \"I don't care what people think\" POV, which makes me think his posts are coming from a consistently town mindset.  IME it's generally pretty difficult for scum to fake that kind of attitude throughout the entire game, and I think he's hit a lot of genuine notes here.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6542383#p6542383\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6542383#p6542383\" data-post-id=\"6542383\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 116</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10332\">MonkeyMan576</a> wrote:</cite>Well, I thought it would be considered an OMGUS, but if you insist.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: Formerfish</div></div></blockquote><br>\nI really don't think anyone as scum would actually post this.  like, I know it's almost too-dumb-to-be-scum, but I think this is another post that fits more with a town \"I don't care what people think\" mentality as opposed to having an agenda.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6542524#p6542524\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6542524#p6542524\" data-post-id=\"6542524\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 123</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10332\">MonkeyMan576</a> wrote:</cite>I invited the attention by my anti-RVS stance, it doesn't make me scum.

As for his suspicion on me, I don't really know what to say when his main point against me is by PoE I must be scum.  I don't think I'm coasting through the game either.  I might be a bit quiet but it's mostly because I'm still trying to figure the game out.  As of the start of Day 2 I was thinking a possible scum team of Toon, Elbirn, and acryon.  Only way that is possible is if Elbirn and acryon are bussing hard their partner for town cred.  Since Toon is being read as scummy by most everyone, that could be the case, but I have doubts that I have been biased that Toon is scum for the whole game and then there is the case that I'm town reading the people on Elbirn's wagon except for Toon.  I feel confident to say that I believe Cheetory is town and of course RC is town.  I'd rather vote with those two than vote Toon with 2 people I think are scum.  And if there are 3 scum in the game, it makes me wonder why Elbirn's lynch is looking like it would be much harder to go through than a Toon lynch.

I might be a bit quiet but it's mostly because I'm still trying to figure the game out.</div>  As of the start of Day 2 I was thinking a possible scum team of Toon, Elbirn, and acryon.  Only way that is possible is if Elbirn and acryon are bussing hard their partner for town cred.

Basically there appears to be a better probability that Elbirn is scum than Toon.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nImportant parts bolded.<br>\n<br>\n1. If you're trying to figure the game out, how is being quiet helping you? I'm reading through your ISO, and I don't really see you making any pushes or scumhunting. You ask lots of questions, but they feel...Idle. Like they don't lead to anything. It's like you might as well have asked about the weather.<br>\n<br>\n2. And once again we get justification for a vote by way of \"I'm just sheeping people I think are town, no big deal\". RC is conf town, but that does not mean she is right. Cheetory might be town, but we don't know that. Your scum reads might be scum, but once again we don't know that they are. So instead of having any reasoning for a vote, we get what basically amounts to an excuse. Hm.<br>\n<br>\nWhy DO you think I'm scum anyway?<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\n1.  Do you really think you need to ask questions to get information about someone?  I ask questions when needed, if I see something I want to point out, I point it out, and then I like to see other people's interactions to see possible links.  For instance, after going through your iso, I noticed a link between you and acryon.  <br>\n<br>\n2.  My vote on you didn't come from thin air, throughout the game I found you suspicious.  I even did mention that I was suspicious of you at the beginning.  Just because I turned my attention and vote on others didn't mean I thought you were town, I just felt there were others more suspicious than you.  I did say at the beginning of day 2 that I thought the scum team was Toon, Elbirn, and acryon.  I voted Toon, then when I saw how the votes ended up I thought you were the best one to vote for, because two scum reads were voting for Toon and one scum read was voting for you.  Also, if Toon flips scum it would be harder to find his buddies, but if you flip scum I will push for acryon next.  <br>\n<br>\nWhy do I think you are scum?<br>\n<br>\n1.  Your vote progression in day 1.  You started saying Victor vs copper was town vs town, then you thought Victor was right and copper was scum, you voted for copper.  Then when the copper wagon wasn't going anywhere you went to Monkey.  That's fine, but then you jumped to Victor at the end and tried to rationalize that even though you were sure he was town you would get more information out of his lynch.  I don't see any town motivation in that, I see as scum trying to get a lynch through.  <br>\n<br>\n2.  This deserves a separate point because you really were looking to hammer anyone at the end.  I can understand if we are at a deadline but there was still a couple of days to go.  It just reeked of overeager scum wanting to lynch someone.<br>\n<br>\n3.

The purpose of the questioning seems to be \"Oh yeah, well if I'm scum, tell me who my partners are.\" As if an inability to find them or any partner tells means anything. Scum-Toon could be making this play to sow doubt in us, or even just to know if we're on his partners trails. As for why Town-Toon would ask this...I don't know. Ha, come to think of it Town-Toon could be doing it for the same reason; trying to shake us off a scumread on him because we can't find any partner tells. Either way it's a crappy move, but I suppose either alignment could make it.<br>\n<br>\nSo I guess the whole thing is null.<br>\n<br>\nSo Toon, after that whole rash of shit, I suppose the least I could do is answer your question. The problem is you have so few interactions with anyone. If you're scum, I could see you being bussed by Acryon/Boon, so maybe start there.

Some weak distancing? Perhaps even Monkey, my scumread on him has weakened into a null, but the way you strong scumread him in that same post 128 but voted for Victor for a crappy reason? That smells like shit. In which case, you're being bussed hard.<br>\n<br>\nIf you flipped town, It'd probably strengthen my read on Boon and Acryon.

You said you didn&#8217;t think him and elbirn were scum-mates, but with your recent turn on elbirn, how does this adjust your read of Monkey?<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Boon</div>  &#8211; Lean-scum<br>\nMan I just cannot read Boon for the life of me.  I&#8217;m certainly torn from my past experiences with him and have never played with scum-boon, so I&#8217;m not sure what that would look like.  Here is what worries me.  <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6583092#p6583092\">803</a> he is scum-reading both me and Monkey and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6583115#p6583115\">805</a> he&#8217;s scumreading Toon.  And now Elbirn is scum.  And in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6586987#p6586987\">910</a> he basically said he doesn&#8217;t think Cheet is town.  So correct me if I&#8217;m wrong Boon, but of 9 other players, you are scumreading fully 4 of them with another being a null or possibly worse?  I don&#8217;t like that.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">SiX/Pieguyn</div>  &#8211; Lean-town<br>\nThe thought process on Victor/Copper in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6551707#p6551707\">315</a> seems to come from a town mindset.  Doesn&#8217;t make much sense to try and logically explain why we should treat two (now confirmed townies) as town.  <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6586086#p6586086\">871</a> from Pieguyn re: MonkeyMan is definitely coming from either town or scum-Monkey&#8217;s scumbuddy.  The thought process for suspecting me makes sense and reads genuine.  This will all make more sense with more flips.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Formerfish</div>  &#8211; Null/Lean-scum<br>\nIt&#8217;s tough to evaluate FF.  So much of his play is so interactive with others that associative reads are huge here.  His recent absence makes reading his current actions difficult.  <br>\n@FF: Can we get an updated reads list?<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">MonkeyMan</div> - Town<br>\nAll in all, Monkey seems like a player that said some silly things, and hasn&#8217;t been able to live it down.  He has had strong wagons a couple times, and thankfully they have died down because I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ve got scum here.  I think people (myself included) sometimes have a hard time with players that always just post one-liners, but I think the stuff he is saying reads really genuine, even if it&#8217;s wrong.  It&#8217;s unlikely to me that scum-Monkey would be saying so many things that are silly/don&#8217;t make sense.  I have to imagine he would be a little more careful about his play, so it does read innocent to me right now.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">eektor</div> &#8211; Town<br>\nGiven Victor and copper-town, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6559932#p6559932\">472</a> from eektor looks town.  If you know someone is going to flip town, why would you get the reads of other people given them flipping town?  That is the direction of thinking <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">town</div> wants to talk about, and the opposite of what scum wants to talk about.  The only thing I&#8217;d like to know about is the Cheet read.<br>\n@eektor: You said earlier that given copper-town or Victor-town, chance of Cheety-scum goes up.

He seemed to sort of piggyback on the defense I initially had for Boon early on, but letting him most slide like he has doesn't fit FF's character.  Not much from Toon-fighter on either of them, but what he has said has been mostly neutral.  FF's stance on toon is odd.

In day one where he agreed with acryon that there is a good chance that Victor and copper was scum together, but if they were both town, you would be more scummy.

I've made it pretty clear I have a scum-lean on eektor, but I don't know if I see him being scum with Boon/Acryon. for example.

This entire post relies on a belief in the opposite. Into the trash it goes.

See <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6598186#p6598186\">1166</a>. Like, okay, we have more info to work with after the flip so your reads are going to change, I get it. But how in the halibut do you go from \"Toon/Boon/Eektor\" as the scumteam, to FF flips scum, to voting for ME? Toon flipped Town, then you fallaciously believe that Boon is more likely town after the FF flip...Which still leaves Eektor. You don't list him as more town or more scum, which doesn't make sense considering he did the same thing that your other three \"more likely scums\" did. Which is crap. And then you vote me. I'm trying to understand your thought process here and it just isn't natural. It seems to imply that your entire reasoning for voting me is an avoidance of FF, even though several others were guilty of the same thing, even though if I WERE scum I wouldn't know he was also scum, and even though you had two other scum reads prior. It just doesn't make any sense.

Yeah I know, you pretty much discredited it in 1284, but then why bring it up in the first place?</div></blockquote><br>\nno, I'm saying ignoring eektor could have been done to mislead<br>\n<br>\nit's not really the same thing; RC was saying that FF ignored you _when you were a viable wagon_, whereas I'm saying FF didn't interact with eektor (as in, he didn't have any posts or conversation directed towards him except responding to posts where eektor was explicitly addressing him).<br>\n<br>\nthe former tell with you is generally more indicative because it is an action that can actually affect who gets lynched or not.  however, I think the vote pattern pointing towards you being town is a stronger tell, and thus more relevant<br>\n<br>\nthe  latter tell with eektor is a textbook tell - scum are more likely to outright ignore their partners - but it's fundamentally a weak tell because it's easy to manipulate, especially if you're a traitor where it would be more likely you'd lay down false interactions.<br>\n<br>\nat the end of the day we can't really tell fuck all from most of this.  interactions aren't useful by themselves a lot of the time; they're more useful when placed in context in order to get a better picture of the game.  so I will still note them in case they become relevant later<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6605299#p6605299\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6605299#p6605299\" data-post-id=\"6605299\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 1286</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=24945\">Elbirn</a> wrote:</cite>My vote switch + FF's vote switch immediately after did in fact even out the wagons between Monkeyman and Victor.

Toon we now know is town, and if Acryon is scum, that's some bullshit because it means there's another town power role out there who, instead of claiming like they should, is letting scum coast with a fakeclaim. So Acryon = conftown as far as I'm concerned.<br>\n<br>\nThe only answer I can come up with is that FF was PoE'ing for a PR, decided you were worth a shot, and blocked you. That or laying a false trail; you were pretty vocal in your scumreads, a blocked you would throw even more suspicion on everyone you scumread.<br>\n<br>\nSpeaking of the PoE'ing part...Did you lay any breadcrumbs for your role early on that FF might have picked up on?<br>\n<br>\n2. I'm assuming softcopclaim is you Vs. Acryon earlier today?<br>\n<br>\nSounds like WIFOM. I'd think any town would vote with the cop claim, and a scum would be more likely to call bullshit. But then if the town play is to follow the cop, then wouldn't the correct scum play be to do as a townie would do? Unless they were dead certain they could prove the claim wrong, and thus invoke some kind of Lynch All Liars policy against the fakeclaimer...

I like her analysis, I like her thought process, it all reads as genuine to me.

Tell me that isn't a damn townie entrance. I don't agree with 100% of it, but it seems to me that she's been trying to game-solve this whole time, and if scum can fake it that well, then congratulations Team-Scum, ya got me. It's also interesting how many townreads she threw out there, and thoroughly explained WHY. I don't see scum being that generous with townreads, nor do I see them giving an in depth explanation for every single one. Her stances on several players in particular, I felt, went against the grain; Monkeyman, Boon, and myself being townread at this stage I found to be notable, considering many were against us, particularly Monkey and myself.<br>\n<br>\nIn the rereading I did for this post, I had an initial worry about her stance on FF, she threw out a townread for him and when I prodded her about it her answer was very brief... and then I remembered; FF was the traitor, so *Team-Scum didn't know he was with them*. And that's it, that's the only scummy thing I could see.<br>\n<br>\nI'm also a big fan of the fact that she pushes people and has actual arguments/discussions with people instead of making commentary and vaguely sniping like everyone else. And her frustration with Eektor/Boon reads genuine to me. All of this, imo, is coming from town. Add the fact that the only people who really seem to be pushing Pie/Elbirn = Team Scum (aside from RC) are my scumreads? Nah.<br>\n<br>\nI've just finished reading her whole ISO. I see no scum here. If anyone wants to come up with a case against her, instead of just saying \"lul Pie is scum\" with ZERO fucking reasoning behind it, I will consider that case. I am willing to consider the possibility that I am wrong, I mean fuck I'm wrong all the time. But considering I've yet to hear a decent reason for her being scum, from anyone? Until that changes, there is absolutely no chance I'm voting her today.", "time": "Thu Feb 19, 2015 5:46 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=60497&start=1500", "forum": "53", "thread": "60497"}

I like her analysis, I like her thought process, it all reads as genuine to me. Go read 929, 930, &amp; 932. Tell me that isn't a damn townie entrance. I don't agree with 100% of it, but it seems to me that she's been trying to game-solve this whole time, and if scum can fake it that well, then congratulations Team-Scum, ya got me. It's also interesting how many townreads she threw out there, and thoroughly explained WHY. I don't see scum being that generous with townreads, nor do I see them giving an in depth explanation for every single one. Her stances on several players in particular, I felt, went against the grain; Monkeyman, Boon, and myself being townread at this stage I found to be notable, considering many were against us, particularly Monkey and myself.<br>\n<br>\nIn the rereading I did for this post, I had an initial worry about her stance on FF, she threw out a townread for him and when I prodded her about it her answer was very brief... and then I remembered; FF was the traitor, so *Team-Scum didn't know he was with them*. And that's it, that's the only scummy thing I could see.<br>\n<br>\nI'm also a big fan of the fact that she pushes people and has actual arguments/discussions with people instead of making commentary and vaguely sniping like everyone else. And her frustration with Eektor/Boon reads genuine to me. All of this, imo, is coming from town. Add the fact that the only people who really seem to be pushing Pie/Elbirn = Team Scum (aside from RC) are my scumreads? Nah.<br>\n<br>\nI've just finished reading her whole ISO. I see no scum here. If anyone wants to come up with a case against her, instead of just saying \"lul Pie is scum\" with ZERO fucking reasoning behind it, I will consider that case. I am willing to consider the possibility that I am wrong, I mean fuck I'm wrong all the time. But considering I've yet to hear a decent reason for her being scum, from anyone? Until that changes, there is absolutely no chance I'm voting her today.</div></blockquote>You think this is ignoring Pie?<br>\nI get that this is prompted, but this defense is pretty elaborate and given odds of Elbirn inevitably flipping this cycle, I feel like this is too blatant of a defense for them both to be scum IMO.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Monkey wrote:</cite>Is being pretty OMGUSy by targeting me after I targeted him.</div></blockquote>Let's say Elbirn is hypothetically town and is genuinely townreading Pie.

You also pushed the right players to win the game.

You saying pie was obvious town when in your shoes you should have been at least wary of pie because the pie / Boon scum team would make more sense than Cheetory being scum.  <br>\n<br>\n@RC - Explaining your reads would have been helpful.  You were the only confirmed town and instead of trying to work with the other town, you were focused on pushing your agenda on everyone else.  This made it very frustrating for me as town and I'm sure the other townies as well.<br>\n<br>\n@pie - no hard feelings and it's all good.  The whole arguing, I didn't really want to argue with you because I thought you were scum trying to do a mislynch on me.

I thought with pie defending you so hard and your reasons for why pie was obv town was kind of lacking meant you were scum.
