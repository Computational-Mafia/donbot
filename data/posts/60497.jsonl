In the next game with him, we lynched him because I couldn't deal with him being in LyLo if he was scum.  This game, he is playing exactly the same as the others, and it feels town.

It's not just that I have seen town and scum do it, but I can think of only one game where the alignment of a IC has even been questioned outside of a jokey fashion (and that was a large theme uPick game where some people suspected the mod of being bastardly).

What did you townread her (him? female avatar going with her until corrected) for? If you completely missed the post stating that she was IC, then you must have read in to some other posts of hers and made a determination that she was town. If you can't tell us what those posts were, then you're just townreading someone without reason, and that might be buddying, or it might be pretending to have reads when you don't, and when you think about it, it sounds like crap.

Policy lynches are a benefit to town because it eliminates players that we are unable to get reads on in normal fashions due to the fact that they don\u2019t play in a normal way. The reason that lynch all lurkers/liars is a thing is because 1. Lurkers need to be socialized so they stop fucking lurking. 2. Liars need to be lynched because they can no longer be trusted. 3. Other things need to be lynched too, if someone plays in such a way that prevents us from being able to get any kind of reliable read on them they probably need to be taken out before lylo happens.<br>In response to what tree people should be barking up:<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6542375#p6542375\" class=\"postlink\">post 114</a>, MonkeyMan576 wrote:</cite>Formerfish for attacking people without even understanding what he's attacking about.

You do not clarify at all, and just give a somewhat off topic answer and leave me to believe that you voted for acryon based off his dislike of you not doing rvs. Later you rail against me for misinterpreting why you voted. Maybe if you answered questions asked of you this wouldn\u2019t happen. And if you choose to not answer questions, don\u2019t put it on the questioner for not understanding. I do think it is funny that you use quoting a post as a reason that I should have understood something when you have quoted many of my posts but not figured out what the fuck I was looking for from you. And then you have to be called out by acryon for not being on me, say that you were worried about OMGUS and voted me. Weak sauce brother, weak sauce. #121 is a blatant attempt to preemptively discredit me. I don\u2019t even know where you would have gotten the idea that you know how good of a player I am or what I can do in regards to scumhunting. I can\u2019t find a completed game with you in it, and doubt you have dove into my games to see what I can do. #197, im sure you do like vote parking on me. You do know that even if you were right (psstt\u2026 you\u2019re not) that I wouldn\u2019t be the only scum left out there. Mini normals usually have a 3 man scum team, you feel like finding any of them, or are you good with just me? Don\u2019t think I really need to wait for an answer, its doubtful you will be looking for anyone else, hate to lock in your needed mislynches this early.<br><br>@Toon- Did you read before you made post #78 with your rvs vote? I don\u2019t see much analysis from your catch up post, more just a commentary. I\u2019m also looking forward to see if you give a shit about people answering the few questions you asked. Your reads are pretty pedestrian. The reluctance to put someone you are scum reading close to a lynch is questionable as well. If Thor was here he would be advocating a wagon going to l-1 as quickly as possible to get the best reads from the reactions. If you think someone is scum vote them, you can get reads based off what happens next. How is pushing someone you are scumreading a bad thing for town? How would it be different in a few days time?<br><br>Re: Copper and the IC stuff. Even if he missed the part where RC was confirmed town you can still talk about agreeing with confirmed town and mean it. I played a game where we had an IC and his reads were so fucking off that it ruined the game because of how insistent he was with them and the fact that he was confirmed town so we should listen. Confirmed town can have shit reads because they only know their own. Being confirmed does nothing for being accurate. Do I think that Copper is on the level with missing the announcement, sure, I wouldn\u2019t have seen it myself if I hadn\u2019t gone back and read from the beginning. Shit, most of the time I just go back to my last post of content when I reread. Now I just need to figure out if Victor thought he had legit figured something out or if this is one of those times where scum picks up on a minute thing and blows it way out of proportion to push a bad read.<br><br>(an aside: I really hate it when people talk about how well they play as scum and how they are incapable of being scum this game because they would be playing better as scum. I just hate listening to people toot their own horns like that.)<br><br>@Futan- what did you mean that Boon is baiting my questions? You say that scum wouldn\u2019t do things that would invite discussion, but scum do that every game. Pushes based off bad intel, bussing, night kills, bad motivation, wifom. All of those things are ways that scum can mess with town to screw us up. And I doubly don\u2019t care about things that people point out themselves as being reasons to not scum read them. \u201cNo guys, I totes can\u2019t be scum because of that, as scum there is no way that I would do that.\u201d Fuck that shit.<br><br>@Copper- I would appreciate if you don\u2019t call my view point retarded. You can disagree and voice that, but you don\u2019t have my experience and you don\u2019t think the way that I do, so I will give you a pass on that first one. If you do it again I will probably burn you to the fucking ground. And don\u2019t think I didn\u2019t notice the subtle discredit towards what I have to say by attacking my scumhunting. You say that Monkey seemed annoyed/disinterested in regards to my line of questioning. Do you feel like that was an appropriate way for him to feel based off the questions I was asking, or do you feel like that was off? I glazed over when you are VDA started going at it again. I don\u2019t see this as scum theater, so you guys both being scum is out. Anything else is yet to be determined.<br><br>@Eek- what parts do you disagree with? I don\u2019t get the beetlejuice tell on Elb at all.<br><br>@Boon- Im pretty sure you have your reads backwards. Monkey is the scum and VDA is the guy who is tilting at windmills.<br><br>@SiX- im giving you one more chance to play this game before I just tunnel into your ass and make sure you are gone regardless of what alignment you are. I have had too many games where scum has just lurkfucked their way into obscurity by staying out of the main discussion and avoiding any sort of heat. If you guys weren\u2019t sure where I lie with policy lynches, this should leave no question. #180, so you\u2019ve read through, congratulations! Reading is half the battle in this game. Now to your analysis of what you read. What? There isn\u2019t any? What do you mean, like he didn\u2019t post much, just a few questions or observations? No. Nothing? The fuck you mean he didn\u2019t get it? Oh Jesus Horatio Christ. Pick something, anything and talk to someone about it you lackluster slot waster. Talk to Monkey about his RVS views. Talk to Acryon about not going after Boon. Talk to me about Monkey. Talk to RC about how nice it is to be able to play this game without the paranoia coming from everyone and having to prove to them she is town. You have nothing?<br><br>@Cheetory- hello sir, welcome aboard.<br><br>Elbs #148 seems town to me. I can follow his line of thought, while not agreeing with all of it (namely the acryon thing again, but I digress). You have a throwaway line shot towards acryon about defending Boon, are you insinuating they are scum together, or that acryon is scum white knighting townBoon or what?<br><br>What in the blue fuck is page 9?<br>-Boon, VDA is town Monkey is scum. And what do you mean that you are changing your rvs vote? I don\u2019t see VDAs post as fluff, so I would request that you explain exactly what you are describing here. And I don\u2019t think their interactions points to VDA scum here. Im just not following you here.<br>- Copper wagon gets a few votes (Not sure where Elb came from on this, know that Monkey is sheeping, but why hop off me?)<br>- Serious lol at confidence being a townreadable thing from Monkey. I\u2019m confident as fuck, but scum in his eyes. Also, lol at you saying that Copper seems nervous for defending himself against someone voting him when he has 3 votes on him. <br>- <blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6548442#p6548442\" class=\"postlink\">post 215</a>, MonkeyMan576 wrote:</cite>It's only a bad vote if Elbirn is scum and Copper is town.</div></blockquote><br>Right because sheeping your buddy on a mislynch sure would be a bad thing."}

Other things need to be lynched too, if someone plays in such a way that prevents us from being able to get any kind of reliable read on them they probably need to be taken out before lylo happens.<br>In response to what tree people should be barking up:</div></blockquote><br><br>How does policy lynches benefit town? You motivate it by saying \"it eliminates players that we are unable to get reads on in normal fashions due to the fact that they don\u2019t play in a normal way.\" What's your definition on how a Normal Play works and what do you mean with \"we\" - You in particular, right? Meaning you suggest policy lynches for your own benefit, and then it all comes down to whether it was a lucky shot or not. Other than that, I agree with you on your thoughts about socializing being important. However, keep in mind some people have busier timetables than others.</div></blockquote><br><br>I don't have an issue with people who are busy. I have an issue with people who do nothing when they are here, e.g. you. Your first post was on page 4 complaining about the amount of posts there were. On page 4 there was like 110 posts. If you can read 110 posts and find something in them to talk about then you are not trying. And policy lynches benefit town because they remove questionable people from the game that scum would be able to push for mislynches later in the game. Say you are scum and you sit here for most of the game not saying much because you are \"busy.\" We forget about you because you are not really playing and you get into endgame with, say, VDA and Copper (for the sake of my argument I am going to say these guys are both town. Real alignments are currently unknown) who have been going at it all game. They cross vote because they have become convinced that the other is scum and you are just lurky low hanging mislynch bait. Town loses because no one was ever able to get a read on you and just assumed that you got brought along for paranoia reasons. Listen, you don't have to agree with me about policy lynches, and for the most part people aren't going to allow them to go through because they forget that we have a certain number of mislynches built into games and we could do worse then off some shitty players, but I am not going to change how I feel about the way I think this game should be played.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I have had too many games where scum has just lurkfucked their way into obscurity by staying out of the main discussion and avoiding any sort of heat. If you guys weren\u2019t sure where I lie with policy lynches, this should leave no question.</div></blockquote><br>Also, what's up with this? Unless you're scum yourself all you're doing is inviting people to sheep and lynch people like low hanging fruit.[/quote]<br><br>I thought this part was pretty self explanatory. In absence of a clear cut choice pling, imo, is not always a bad thing, which I have gone on about at length. I think your empty accusation based off me saying you might be a good policy lynch is the weirdest OMGUS read I've seen."}

Furthermore, I consider what most people consider to be town / scum tells to be bunk and null, while a lot of relational tells and other things that aren't exactly on most people's radars matter a great deal to the development of my reads.  If you'd consult my meta, you'd notice that I have a strong history of staying fairly neutral and then tunneling people on a hairpin once I've accumulated enough evidence or see a smoking gun. I even used to have a habit of fakeclaiming cop whenever I really want to push a read, but guess what? once I reached that point I've never been wrong, and in general my town winrate both on this website and outside it has been quite stellar, in no small part due to my scumhunting ability. (My ability to seem town could use a little work and that's why I'm very happy to have the role that I've been assigned.)

I think that you have to take what people say about you with a grain of salt. If you believe in what you are saying then you need to find the evidence to back your reads up and be able to advocate it to the group. I mentioned briefly how an IC can wreck havoc in games, but didn't go in depth. In Touhou Jaqen (a waynegg alt) was confirmed to be an IC and proceeded to tunnel on town to the point where scum was able to run straight over the town because we couldn't get Jaqen to move off what he felt was a sure thing. RC, I've played with you once I think and that was towards the beginning of my career here. If you are able to succinctly push your scum reads and have the foundations for them securely set then I don't think there is an issue. People are going to take shots at you the same as any other townie because you are fallible with your reads whether you are confirmed or not. I think that once we have a few flips then it will become more apparent whether or not we should worry about the people trying to tear you down before you even get started."}

Therefore Copper equals scum.</span><br><br>If we follow Copper's lead on Victor being scum, then it'd be ignorant to not consider Copper also as being scum. But since both of you're doubtfully scum it'd mean that either are you both town or one of you is scum. But because the arguement both of you put forth holds equal weight, It's not possible to consider one scum and leave the other out. Therefore the logical conclusion would be that if not both are scum (Unless schemed) and a specific scum can't be concluded both of you are likely to be town <span style=\"font-style: italic\">for now</span>.<br><br>So @RadiantCowBells I'd like to know why you consider Victor a very solid lynch although what he brings forth is equal to Copper's.<br><br>And in case both of you're Town, who here hasn't seen what's currently going on (Page 11-13) about 2 later revealed town members making wallsposts arguing about why they are correct. Therefore I aswell judge this scenario based on my experience. Granted, I dismissed completely your current arguements about why you're correct and why the other one is incorrect since what was of importance to me as it's origin. But if you wish to debate my conclusion here, go ahead and explain to me why you consider yourself correct without being just as suspicious yourself.<br><br>Also, I haven't seen you active since post 7 (Although I myself probably am not one to talk).<br>However, please show you're still here by providing your train of thoughts.

Again, this one is tough because I have only played with each of them as scum before, so my perspective is skewed a little more than I'd like on both of them.  I think Victor is the more likely of the two, because the angles of attack and tunneling he's doing are <span style=\"font-style: italic\">very</span> reminiscent of the scum-play I've seen from him.  The only thing that bugs me is that all of his scum-reads have/had some traction of their own, and he doesn't strike me as the type to play that way as scum, although admittedly that is mostly gut.  Copper's defensiveness isn't great, but I'm not sure it's worse than Victor's tunneling.  I don't think there's anything to glean from IC-gate.  It doesn't feel like that would be his game, but I'm also not going to completely rule it out, so it's a null at this point.<br><br>Futan - If I had a gun put to my head, I would say he is scum, and his posts seem very active lurking-ish.

At this point in the game it's not a big point admittadly, but I still see his originally vote as suspicious particularly when you consider how awkward his defenses have been. I also believe <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6541882#p6541882\">96</a> was a flat out lie.<br><br>2) Continued attempts to deflect. This is a bigger point, when defending himself he has attempted to create strawman arguments to defend. For instance, in response to my vote he claimed that I was accusing him of trying a <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6541885#p6541885\">high-risk, gambit</a> (neither claim related to anything in my posting), so he could then proceed to argue that <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6541916#p6541916\">he was too good as scum to do such a thing</a>. <br><br>3) Refusal to build his case against me. He is scumreading me and voting me <span class=\"noboldsig\">but</span> he is never really tried to drive a case home. Particularly when accusing me of something he is not backing it up proof. You can actually clearly see this in his case, where he links a lot of own posts talking about scummy stuff I've supposedly done, but the only actual point he link to my positng is my defences of Elbirn (which is probably the least scummy thing he's accursing me of). Again there's more examples of this in his ISO.<br><br>I also think you should look his posts at his language. A lot of it feels unnatural, for lack of a better term.

It basically boils down to his play and push on copper being generally scummy.  He is hard-pushing, but then latching on to little things that aren't scummy and trying to make them look scummy.  His play and push seem desperate and reachy, like he doesn't really have the gas for it, but he knows he has to keep pushing because he's in too deep.  Copper is doing something very similar with Victor only a bit different."}

I think that scum can tunnel because most people usually attribute that to a town style of play. How many times have you seen someone dismissed as most likely town \"because they continue a push where scum probably would have backed off.\" I've seen it a bunch of times and have tunneled myself as scum (flying aces as messiah complex day 1 against jiffy). I think the same thing could be said about the person flitting from one read to the other. This easily gets dismissed as attempts to scumhunt and looking active.

I never vote my buddies in rvs, I never make pushes I wouldn't make as town. There is nothing you shouldn't do as scum to try and win. Good scum changes their approach and activities all the time to avoid being easily detected. This is why I think that while meta might give you some clues you really need to evaluate what you have right in front of you. I swore up and down Boon was scum last game (Ninja) because he acted scummy. I know his meta to be town when he does the things he does, but it doesn't change the fact that I read him as scum when he does those things. Eventually his play style is going to bite me in the ass."}

I'm leaning town with SiX, not sure about Boon.  I do agree with Boon that the first wagon that formed is different from this one.  Perhaps someone from first wagon was an early bussing and would switch to another target later in the day.  The first wagon was a bit early in the day.  Although fish was the most vocal in that first wagon I find it odd that he is voting with Monkey right now.  Acryon's theory that victor vs copper is scum vs scum is a theory that Toon latched onto so maybe that could be a possibility.  <br><br>It's easier to analyze interactions when you know certain flips, but I do believe you have a better chance of finding scum in Monkey or Toon than victor or copper."}

And while I agree on some of your other reads (Monkey and Acryon are on the wagon and I'm not a fan of them frankly), your refusing to \"compromise\" and vote Toon is based on 1. an absolute confidence that they are scum, instead of considering other possibilities and trying to puzzle this game out, and 2. not acknowledging the possibility of scum voting scum. If you think Toon is scum, if you interpret his actions and his words as scummy, then you need to be open to lynching him, who gives a fuck who's on his wagon. If you still think I'm more likely scum, then fine, hang me first, but don't hedge on your opinion on Toon because you scumread people voting him.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6585626#p6585626\" class=\"postlink\">post 860</a>, RadiantCowbells wrote:</cite>\"Hi, I'm MonkeyMan576.

Monkey had a lot of people looking at him for scum during day 1, and when people started to reevaluate the VDA/Cop fight they either saw town in it, or were willing to wait it out a day and switched votes to another scum read.

You do appear to be setting Cheet up for a lynch candidate. You point out that he is buddying the IC and that when you call him on it he overreacts. It also appears that you are voting Toon because he blatantly sheeped the IC when RC made it clear that it was Toon or Elb today. Don't act like you can't be working on multiple levels with plays here. And don't ever assume that my reading comprehension is subpar, that point coming from you is simply laughable.

At least when I get lynched and flip town lynch Formerfish next.</div></blockquote><br>first off is that whole shitstorm re: FF.  I really like the conviction here.  while I can look at it and do think it was a bit of an overreaction, I think in this case it's more likely to come from indignated town whose playstyle is mostly centered around trying to outyell FF and make him look worse as opposed to presenting logic-based arguments.  I also think that early game, making strong pushes is the best way to move the game forward and create new content, and I don't think scum would put themselves so far out there so quickly for (as far as I could tell) no reason.  I look at this and think it's more likely to come from town who legitimately think they're onto something as opposed to scum pushing any kind of agenda.  there are also some parallels here to the previous game I played with him; I can confirm MM tends to dislike when people push more strongly than what he perceives as necessary in RVS, and I can confirm that he does this regardless of how much of a reach his own reasons for pushing people are.<br><br>now, this isn't much of a tell on its own, but it is the first part of a long series of posts that I think are more likely to come from a town \"I don't care what people think\" POV, which makes me think his posts are coming from a consistently town mindset.  IME it's generally pretty difficult for scum to fake that kind of attitude throughout the entire game, and I think he's hit a lot of genuine notes here.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6542383#p6542383\" class=\"postlink\">post 116</a>, MonkeyMan576 wrote:</cite>Well, I thought it would be considered an OMGUS, but if you insist.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: Formerfish</span></div></blockquote><br>I really don't think anyone as scum would actually post this.  like, I know it's almost too-dumb-to-be-scum, but I think this is another post that fits more with a town \"I don't care what people think\" mentality as opposed to having an agenda.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6542524#p6542524\" class=\"postlink\">post 123</a>, MonkeyMan576 wrote:</cite>I invited the attention by my anti-RVS stance, it doesn't make me scum.  A lot of people are exaggerating the link between RVS and lynching the bad guys.</div></blockquote><br>this indicates that he knew he was inviting attention with his anti-RVS stance and didn't have a problem with it.  again, I think this is more likely to come from a town mindset as opposed to scum pushing an agenda.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6548459#p6548459\" class=\"postlink\">post 217</a>, MonkeyMan576 wrote:</cite>Nice that you're trying to discredit me.

I  would expect (again) that if he was scum trying to discredit copper here, he would at the very least be able to give more of a shit about his appearance; imo the way he's willing to go around antagonizing basically everyone in the game is more indicative of a town mindset<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6567030#p6567030\" class=\"postlink\">post 619</a>, MonkeyMan576 wrote:</cite>Mostly I am trying to get a feel for everyone because I haven't played with most of the people in the game afaik.

Only way that is possible is if Elbirn and acryon are bussing hard their partner for town cred.

I'd rather vote with those two than vote Toon with 2 people I think are scum.</span>  And if there are 3 scum in the game, it makes me wonder why Elbirn's lynch is looking like it would be much harder to go through than a Toon lynch.  Basically there appears to be a better probability that Elbirn is scum than Toon.</div></blockquote><br><br>Important parts bolded.<br><br>1. If you're trying to figure the game out, how is being quiet helping you? I'm reading through your ISO, and I don't really see you making any pushes or scumhunting. You ask lots of questions, but they feel...Idle. Like they don't lead to anything. It's like you might as well have asked about the weather.<br><br>2. And once again we get justification for a vote by way of \"I'm just sheeping people I think are town, no big deal\". RC is conf town, but that does not mean she is right. Cheetory might be town, but we don't know that. Your scum reads might be scum, but once again we don't know that they are. So instead of having any reasoning for a vote, we get what basically amounts to an excuse. Hm.<br><br>Why DO you think I'm scum anyway?<br></div></blockquote><br><br>1.  Do you really think you need to ask questions to get information about someone?  I ask questions when needed, if I see something I want to point out, I point it out, and then I like to see other people's interactions to see possible links.  For instance, after going through your iso, I noticed a link between you and acryon.  <br><br>2.  My vote on you didn't come from thin air, throughout the game I found you suspicious.  I even did mention that I was suspicious of you at the beginning.  Just because I turned my attention and vote on others didn't mean I thought you were town, I just felt there were others more suspicious than you.  I did say at the beginning of day 2 that I thought the scum team was Toon, Elbirn, and acryon.  I voted Toon, then when I saw how the votes ended up I thought you were the best one to vote for, because two scum reads were voting for Toon and one scum read was voting for you.  Also, if Toon flips scum it would be harder to find his buddies, but if you flip scum I will push for acryon next.  <br><br>Why do I think you are scum?<br><br>1.  Your vote progression in day 1.  You started saying Victor vs copper was town vs town, then you thought Victor was right and copper was scum, you voted for copper.  Then when the copper wagon wasn't going anywhere you went to Monkey.  That's fine, but then you jumped to Victor at the end and tried to rationalize that even though you were sure he was town you would get more information out of his lynch.  I don't see any town motivation in that, I see as scum trying to get a lynch through.  <br><br>2.  This deserves a separate point because you really were looking to hammer anyone at the end.  I can understand if we are at a deadline but there was still a couple of days to go.  It just reeked of overeager scum wanting to lynch someone.<br><br>3.  There's been twice I've seen people accuse you and you throw up a post of \"who cares\".  That type of behavior I see as coming more from scum who feels like they got caught."}

Some weak distancing? Perhaps even Monkey, my scumread on him has weakened into a null, but the way you strong scumread him in that same post 128 but voted for Victor for a crappy reason? That smells like shit. In which case, you're being bussed hard.<br><br>If you flipped town, It'd probably strengthen my read on Boon and Acryon.

He has had strong wagons a couple times, and thankfully they have died down because I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve got scum here.  I think people (myself included) sometimes have a hard time with players that always just post one-liners, but I think the stuff he is saying reads really genuine, even if it\u2019s wrong.  It\u2019s unlikely to me that scum-Monkey would be saying so many things that are silly/don\u2019t make sense.  I have to imagine he would be a little more careful about his play, so it does read innocent to me right now.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">eektor</span> \u2013 Town<br>Given Victor and copper-town, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6559932#p6559932\">472</a> from eektor looks town.

You don't have any other reasoning for a scumread beyond \"if so and so flips whatever\", and based on some unexplained \"VCA\" and unspecified \"reactions\". And you won't push Acryon or question him or vote him or anything. Oh, but you totally scumread him, so it's okay!<br><br>See in the context of you not actually having good reasons for scumreading him, I'm totally fine with you not quickhammering him. It makes sense to not do something stupid. (that was one hell of a sentence, I was gonna edit that one out or reword it but God does that sounds like something I should be saying to Boon.) But for you to scumread him in the first place based solely on preflip associations, and to say nothing of his actual play. It sounds like a loada crap. It sounds like distancing without any substance. It just keeps giving me that impression that you two are buddies, and Boon really, really doesn't want to bus."}

My scum read on acryon was based on his day one victor and copper is scum together and I saw a link with Elbirn, but if I'm leaning town on Elbirn, that weakens my scum read on him.  I would like to say there has to be at least one scum between Monkey and Boon, but their playstyle makes it seem like they are lynchbait and I wouldn't want to waste a vote on what I think might be a 50% chance of getting scum.

I say there is one mostly because I can't read them and from PoE one of them is scum.  Also, the playstyles between Monkey and Boon is different from Toon.  A lot of Toon's post are pretty scummy.  In day one where he agreed with acryon that there is a good chance that Victor and copper was scum together, but if they were both town, you would be more scummy.  That just sounds like he was setting up himself to vote for whoever between Victor and copper and set up multiple possible lynches for Day 2.  Also, recently when he asked someone's opinion on who his partners would be if he flips scum.  Why would town ever ask something like that?"}

This entire post relies on a belief in the opposite. Into the trash it goes. If we want to look at interactions, we have to look at what Former has said and done. <br><br>The decision to vote me based on Fishy's flip stinks. It just seems weird that you vote me for it. See <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6598186#p6598186\">1166</a>. Like, okay, we have more info to work with after the flip so your reads are going to change, I get it. But how in the halibut do you go from \"Toon/Boon/Eektor\" as the scumteam, to FF flips scum, to voting for ME? Toon flipped Town, then you fallaciously believe that Boon is more likely town after the FF flip...Which still leaves Eektor. You don't list him as more town or more scum, which doesn't make sense considering he did the same thing that your other three \"more likely scums\" did. Which is crap. And then you vote me. I'm trying to understand your thought process here and it just isn't natural. It seems to imply that your entire reasoning for voting me is an avoidance of FF, even though several others were guilty of the same thing, even though if I WERE scum I wouldn't know he was also scum, and even though you had two other scum reads prior. It just doesn't make any sense. Please elaborate.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6603805#p6603805\" class=\"postlink\">post 1208</a>, MonkeyMan576 wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6603789#p6603789\" class=\"postlink\">post 1203</a>, pieguyn wrote:</cite>my initial thought is that FF had most of the scum in his scum reads, and that's why he died - it is usually normal traitor play (for a traitor who knows his team) to slightly bus your teammates so they can figure out who you are.  this would (again) point to acryon.</div></blockquote><br><br>WIFOM!</div></blockquote><br><br>Discrediting a line of reasoning with a buzzword.

Yeah I know, you pretty much discredited it in 1284, but then why bring it up in the first place?</div></blockquote><br>no, I'm saying ignoring eektor could have been done to mislead<br><br>it's not really the same thing; RC was saying that FF ignored you _when you were a viable wagon_, whereas I'm saying FF didn't interact with eektor (as in, he didn't have any posts or conversation directed towards him except responding to posts where eektor was explicitly addressing him).<br><br>the former tell with you is generally more indicative because it is an action that can actually affect who gets lynched or not.  however, I think the vote pattern pointing towards you being town is a stronger tell, and thus more relevant<br><br>the  latter tell with eektor is a textbook tell - scum are more likely to outright ignore their partners - but it's fundamentally a weak tell because it's easy to manipulate, especially if you're a traitor where it would be more likely you'd lay down false interactions.<br><br>at the end of the day we can't really tell fuck all from most of this.  interactions aren't useful by themselves a lot of the time; they're more useful when placed in context in order to get a better picture of the game.  so I will still note them in case they become relevant later<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6605299#p6605299\" class=\"postlink\">post 1286</a>, Elbirn wrote:</cite>My vote switch + FF's vote switch immediately after did in fact even out the wagons between Monkeyman and Victor.

If you're scum, Boon, then gg. <br><br>Eektor and Monkeyman have, imo, been playing in a manner that avoids attention. Eektor I can see as being very inconsistent with his reads. Yesterday I was prob town and Monkey was probscum, then today he decides monkey is most likely town because of a reason that I think makes Monkey most likely scum (FF's wagon on Monkey) and starts going after me for...Some....reason? Eektor, why do you think I'm scum now? Because you haven't made that clear at all from what I can tell. Or whatever reasons you think I'm scum now didn't phase you yesterday? Why not?"}

And I thought Monkey would be scum with either Fish or Elbirn. I guess I can't necessarily make monkey conf town yet. But if Monkey is scum, I do still feel Elbirn would be his partner.

Tell me that isn't a damn townie entrance. I don't agree with 100% of it, but it seems to me that she's been trying to game-solve this whole time, and if scum can fake it that well, then congratulations Team-Scum, ya got me. It's also interesting how many townreads she threw out there, and thoroughly explained WHY. I don't see scum being that generous with townreads, nor do I see them giving an in depth explanation for every single one. Her stances on several players in particular, I felt, went against the grain; Monkeyman, Boon, and myself being townread at this stage I found to be notable, considering many were against us, particularly Monkey and myself.<br><br>In the rereading I did for this post, I had an initial worry about her stance on FF, she threw out a townread for him and when I prodded her about it her answer was very brief... and then I remembered; FF was the traitor, so *Team-Scum didn't know he was with them*. And that's it, that's the only scummy thing I could see.<br><br>I'm also a big fan of the fact that she pushes people and has actual arguments/discussions with people instead of making commentary and vaguely sniping like everyone else. And her frustration with Eektor/Boon reads genuine to me. All of this, imo, is coming from town. Add the fact that the only people who really seem to be pushing Pie/Elbirn = Team Scum (aside from RC) are my scumreads? Nah.<br><br>I've just finished reading her whole ISO. I see no scum here. If anyone wants to come up with a case against her, instead of just saying \"lul Pie is scum\" with ZERO fucking reasoning behind it, I will consider that case. I am willing to consider the possibility that I am wrong, I mean fuck I'm wrong all the time. But considering I've yet to hear a decent reason for her being scum, from anyone? Until that changes, there is absolutely no chance I'm voting her today."}

Clear association with FF, lack of content, vague and fallacious sniping instead of a coherent case. Even when he thinks someone is scum, he doesn't push it. So far this game he's defended himself from FF, made pointless commentary and voted on whatever the leading wagon was. And that's it. So far today all he's done is say \"Pie and Elbirn are scum\" on repeat, with zero backing evidence. It's crap. It's all crap."}

I think it's pretty obvious Elbirn is town here, but I don't expect MM or RC to do fuck all about it because they're still thinking Elbirn is scum for *insert shit reason here* (like, really, MM's entire reason is that Elbirn and FF didn't interact much with each other, which is somewhat ok, but that's literally the only fucking reason he has so far besides him apparently being on a team with me.  and I don't even know what the fuck RC is going on about at all with his push there, really).  :/"}

I'd like to know exactly *why* you think everything you're pointing out here is actually scummy.</div></blockquote><br><br>Why would scum not jump on a soft cop claim that someone is guilty when they know they are town?  So if you shift to acryon being town, it should cause you to doubt your Elbirn town read.  You are too sure Elbirn is town.  You are so sure of Elbirn being town, that if we lynch Boon and he flips town, you still wouldn't doubt Elbirn is town."}

I like her analysis, I like her thought process, it all reads as genuine to me. Go read 929, 930, &amp; 932. Tell me that isn't a damn townie entrance. I don't agree with 100% of it, but it seems to me that she's been trying to game-solve this whole time, and if scum can fake it that well, then congratulations Team-Scum, ya got me. It's also interesting how many townreads she threw out there, and thoroughly explained WHY. I don't see scum being that generous with townreads, nor do I see them giving an in depth explanation for every single one. Her stances on several players in particular, I felt, went against the grain; Monkeyman, Boon, and myself being townread at this stage I found to be notable, considering many were against us, particularly Monkey and myself.<br><br>In the rereading I did for this post, I had an initial worry about her stance on FF, she threw out a townread for him and when I prodded her about it her answer was very brief... and then I remembered; FF was the traitor, so *Team-Scum didn't know he was with them*. And that's it, that's the only scummy thing I could see.<br><br>I'm also a big fan of the fact that she pushes people and has actual arguments/discussions with people instead of making commentary and vaguely sniping like everyone else. And her frustration with Eektor/Boon reads genuine to me. All of this, imo, is coming from town. Add the fact that the only people who really seem to be pushing Pie/Elbirn = Team Scum (aside from RC) are my scumreads? Nah.<br><br>I've just finished reading her whole ISO. I see no scum here. If anyone wants to come up with a case against her, instead of just saying \"lul Pie is scum\" with ZERO fucking reasoning behind it, I will consider that case. I am willing to consider the possibility that I am wrong, I mean fuck I'm wrong all the time. But considering I've yet to hear a decent reason for her being scum, from anyone? Until that changes, there is absolutely no chance I'm voting her today.</div></blockquote>You think this is ignoring Pie?<br>I get that this is prompted, but this defense is pretty elaborate and given odds of Elbirn inevitably flipping this cycle, I feel like this is too blatant of a defense for them both to be scum IMO.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Monkey wrote:</cite>Is being pretty OMGUSy by targeting me after I targeted him.</div></blockquote>Let's say Elbirn is hypothetically town and is genuinely townreading Pie.

You played really well analyzing Copper vs VDA, sorry we got it wrong D1 btw but he really looked scummy to me and I guess I looked really scummy to him, what can you do, and D2 hinting at having something on Acryon, but after most of the town started to treat you as confirmed (and here the analogy with Radiant) you started posturing and telling them how bad they are instead of worrying about winning the game, that shit about being happy with a MM lynch because his play was crap if he is town is just terrible, you are justifying a mislynch in your eyes before it even happens so every analysis you will do after that is going to be super biased.<br><br>@Radiant<br>The problem with your play from how I saw it was not that your scumreads were wrong, that can happen, it was you did not provide the meat for why you were reading these people in said manner, so the rest of town had no clue about what you were thinking, you also have a super annyoing habit of telling the rest of us you had it figured out after the fact when it goes wrong, like after every mislynch you would say something along the lines of: oh I was just about to switch my vote or yes I pushed this because it's an infolynch regardless of so and so's alignment, I don't believe that's always the case and you shouldn't worry about getting it wrong and trying to justify yourself, just play your best and let the results speak for themselves.<br><br>@Eektor<br>Solid play, I dragged you on the first lynch so if anything blame me, unfortunately this game some townplayers looked really scummy so being on a mislynch is not as bad as you make it sound, I think the Boon/Pie bus was something nobody bothered much to analyize and it could have helped (but maybe that's just me having extra info) and you should have considered sleep as well to get in an extra check from Cheetory, but other than that protecting the IC and claiming at Mylo was fine.<br><br>@Acryon<br>Fuck you mate for shooting me and abandoning the game <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\";-)\" title=\"Wink\">, you should have at least won it to make it up to me and preserve my winrate <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\">.

Your play with the RB soft would have worked because Boon shot you during the night so you would have bene recruited, Acryon prolonged the agony for town but a well deserved win.<br><br>@Boon<br>Well played D1, I especially liked you saying you don't know how to read me, I was thinking about what you did with Flubber in our previous mafia game and how you tried to pocket him, but this time you did not stick to your townread at all costs so it was much harder to see you and Former were splitting on Copper/Vda and I thought your townread of me was genuine, dumb Copper I guess :p. You also pushed the right players to win the game. Personally I would not have bussed Pieguyn but despite Acryon's fanatasies (and his unfortunate small sample size of games played with me where I did actually bus because I had to) I almost never bus my scumpartners.<br><br>@Pieguyn<br>Made the best out of the Boon bus and managed to make some townie catch-ups, good job. <br><br>@Elbirn<br>Discussed in the dead thread, I disagree that you played so bad, we were at two ends of the town crashing into each other so we both got it wrong but at least you were one of the few who tried to make his positions clear and to analyze the game.<br><br>@Toon<br>You looked really scummy mate <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\"><br><br>@Futan<br>The real MVP this game, correct read on Victor and Copper, manages to get shot as VT by scum because they believe he is a PR, turns out the newest player was actually the best town player this game!<br><br>@VDA<br>No hard feelings from my side.<br><br>@Flames<br>Thanks for modding, please post setup relevant information in character 44 at the start of the game for dummies like me <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\";-)\" title=\"Wink\">"}

I thought with pie defending you so hard and your reasons for why pie was obv town was kind of lacking meant you were scum.  I guess now that I think of it, it would have made more sense the other way around.<br><br>@Boon - Well played, I will definitely be up to lynching you much earlier in the next game I play with you. <br><br>@acryon - Town MVP, the only town that actually got something right and killed the traitor even though we gave you tons of crap over the Victor vs copper scum vs scum read.<br><br>@Everyone else It was a pleasure playing with you guys.

When Eektor did not hammer you, it should have been pretty clear to you he was town as well, instead you quibbled with him about the technical meaning of confirmed which looked very suspicious to someone not knowing your alignment.<br><br>More in general I have a hard time with you because I don't understand where most of your reads are coming from and why, this is the second game where I correctly peg you as town based on the wagons that build up on you and both times you called me scum for reasons I still don't understand, your Elbirn sheep because he seemed confident in his posting this game was really weird to me for instance.<br><br>@RC<br>You claimed to be a great player at the start and this game I did not see it, people are bound to be bitter about it but I don't think you are bad, just too self assured and not transparent enough with how you communicate, this is not ment to be insulting, if you disagree you may well be right but this is my take on how you cam improve your game."}

There are a lot of different playstyles and levels of experience in mafia and to me part of the game is playing with someone you might have a personality conflict with.

If you didn't want a Toon lynch, why did you hammer? You explained it as not wanting anyone else to claim; was that really justification enough? I don't feel like hammering someone you believe is town to be a good play. Anyone wanna talk theory on that?"}
