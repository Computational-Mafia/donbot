The site wide rules apply<br>\n2. Play to your win condition<br>\n3. We are all here to have fun, avoid personal attacks, attack a players play instead<br>\n4. Do not impersonate or pretend to be the moderator. My colour <div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF0000\">is this Red</div><br>\n5. Do not edit or delete your posts in this thread. If there is a problem with a post, such as incorrect formatting, ask me to fix it for you.<br>\n6. Do not quote communications outside the game thread, including role PMs, quicktopics, etc., in the game thread. This specifically includes PM timestamps. Paraphrasing is allowed. If in doubt, ask.<br>\n7. Unless I have specifically told you it is allowed, do not talk about this game outside of this game thread until it is completed.<br>\n8. Do not use cryptography, invisible text, tiny text, or the like.<br>\n9. Do not use any form of provable randomness. Claiming you rolled dice and acting on that is fine. Using dice tags is not.<br>\n10. Do not bring outside factors into this game. This includes, among other things, making bets, promises of real life rewards, etc.<br>\n11.  Claiming scum by yourself is fine. Claiming scum with others is not, regardless of the truth of this claim.<br>\n12. Pretending to break a rule will be treated the same as breaking the rule.<br>\n13. Breaking one of these rules may, at my discretion, result in a modkill. If you are modkilled, you will become a Neutral Survivor, and thus automatically lose. Modkilling may or may not end the game day.<br>\n14. No set of rules can be all-encompassing. I reserve the right to take any action at any time, for any reason. However, I try to be extremely reasonable. If you have any questions about the game, rules, or players, please ask me via PM.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Activity Rules</div><br>\n1. If a player goes 72 real life hours without posting or 48 hours on request, they will be prodded at my discretion, Prods will be announced in thread.<br>\n2. A Proded player has 48 hours to respond to said prod if they don&#8217;t they will be replaced<br>\n3. If you receive 3 prods in one game day then you will be replaced.<br>\n4. Each game day will have a deadline of 14 real life days (2 weeks)<br>\n5. In the event a deadline is reached before a lynch then a <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">No Lynch</div> will occur.<br>\n6. Each night will have a deadline of 3 real life days (72 hours)<br>\n7. If a player has a night action and fails to submit before the deadline, no action will be performed by that player<br>\n8. Deadlines may be extended in the case of replacements but this will be at my own discretion.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Voting Rules</div><br>\n1. Votes must be at the beginning of a new line, using vote tags or <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">bold</div> (<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Player name</span>/<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">VOTE: Player name</div>). If you do not wish to lynch, you may <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: No Lynch</span>/<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">VOTE: No Lynch</div>. Abbreviations, missing punctuation, and misspellings will be accepted as long as it is obvious to me who is being voted for. If I perceive it as a vote, it counts as a vote.<br>\n2. It is not necessary to explicitly unvote (<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: Player name</span>/<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">UNVOTE: Player name</div>) before voting someone else, though it is preferred.<br>\n3. Once a majority of votes is reached (# of players / 2 + 1, rounded down), that person is lynched. <br>\n4.  All living players, including the lynchee, may continue to post until I lock the thread.<br>\n5. If you are dead, You may make one post with no game related content (a bah post) during the next day.", "time": "Fri Feb 01, 2013 5:02 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=25526&start=0", "forum": "53", "thread": "25526"}

Slandaar's, on the other hand, has alternated between being directed at Om and being addressed to the town in general which comes of as him being more interested in the towns view of the confrontation that the confrontation itself.<br>\nMy reads here are that either Om is scum and Slandaar town OR Om is inept town and Slandaar scum. Either way I do feel that one of them is scum (leaning towards OM, but not sure), it doesn't feel like town on town (gut feel here, but meh) and it doesn't look like bussing. They should both be watched further to distinguish which is what.", "time": "Sat Feb 02, 2013 9:04 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=25526&start=100", "forum": "53", "thread": "25526"}

So you're telling me that I can say \"I find XXX scummy. Vote: XXX\" and people won't question me? No way. Not after the first page maybe. Town DOES look for excuses and reasons. In this game, excuses and reasons are what drive people to act, not withholding information or baseless claims.<br>\n<br>\n===<br>\n<br>\nI'm also going to answer all these floating questions regarding why I changed to TheTrollie so quickly: It was random because I had absolutely no read on anyone.

His analysis of Om's posts makes sense to me, as well as his rebuttal. Although some of his language is exaggerated, Slandaar is no longer relying on as much RVS evidence and more about Om's reactions and his language.<br>\n<br>\nStarting from further back:<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4691228#p4691228\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4691228#p4691228\" data-post-id=\"4691228\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 95</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=16634\">Slandaar</a> wrote:</cite>If he wants me to post there must be a reason behind it; it was 1 hour into game start so why does he want me to post? does he think I am not going to post without him voting me? (obviously not)</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nSlandaar is reasonable here. There still were and still are some players who have NOT posted a single thing yet, but Om and DannFlor pressed Slandaar to talk. rather than anybody else.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">PEDIT: WOW... the rate at which Slandaar vs Om thing is developing is insane. I started writing this and realized that the whole thing concluded before I could finish my thought. I'll try to summarize my thoughts.</div><br>\n<br>\nOkay...<br>\nOm defends himself by cross examining Slandaar and asking him to explain himself. However, Om's response was (as Slandaar stated) not well thought out.<br>\nOm's recent unvote is also scummy. From what I can see, it can either be one of the following two things:<br>\n1) Scum withdrawing his vote when under heavy pressure from Slandaar due to lack of evidence.<br>\n2) Townie withdrawing his vote because he doesn't think arguing to keep his vote isn't worth the effort.<br>\n<br>\nI don't want to call a black and white answer (unlike Slandaar's claim that Om MUST be scum), but I am leaning toward number 1. To me, Om's been attacking Slandaar based on what Om perceives as random or strange responses to his questions. Because Om's original attack came from <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4690782#p4690782\" class=\"postlink\">post 88</a> (the post basically attacks Slandaar based on his questions that he asked others), I find Om's attack to be weak. I found Slandaar's questions addressed to others perfectly reasonable and worth asking (such as someone's favorite role) and found your sudden attack on him suspicious. Continuing, Om continued to argue against Slandaar based on evidences that originated in a much earlier and god-forbid-RVS, Om was forced to either continue to argue and lose or unvote and become suspicious.<br>\n<br>\nMy final verdict? I find Om's actions to be scummy but I also feel like Om just put himself in a situation in which he could NOT escape without a negative consequence hitting him. Basically, he cornered himself, whether he's town or not. Not a complete scumtell, but a mistake worth noting.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Unvote: TheTrollie</div><br>\n<br>\n(unvote because it's time to get off the train)<br>\n<br>\n===<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Regarding Jennifer and Dannflor:</div><br>\n<br>\nAs Mr.Frog has stated already, Jenn's <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4689159#p4689159\" class=\"postlink\">post 22</a> came off as scummy (which I agreed with).<br>\n<br>\nI get a sense that Jenn is reluctant to attack Dunnflor. She started off the bat by voting Dunn then switched off to me based on a vote change that was even more random that hers. Since then, she has continued to pursue me despite me having made clear that my vote change to Trollie was on a whim.<br>\n<br>\n@Jennifer: Is there anything else you find scummy other than my vote on TheTrollie and my opinion on the usage of excuse vs reasons?<br>\n<br>\nAnyway, she claims that she has finished probing Dannflor and has moved on. However, Dannflor also acknowledges nothing scummy about Jenn's posts. This comes off as extremely strange. Despite Jenn's willingness to change votes randomly, Dannflor keeps his vote on me and claims that I am definitely (even if just little more definitely than he finds Jenn) more scummy.<br>\n<br>\nHow did Jenn and Dann come to a sudden understanding between each other? Why are they both attacking me? I feel like their coordination is planned. This leads me to conclude that Jenn and Dann are potential scumbuddies. Yes, this is early in the game to start claiming scumbuddies, but this is just my speculation.

Look at Om's <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?t=25526&amp;f=2&amp;st=0&amp;sk=t&amp;sd=a&amp;user_select=20338&amp;user_select2=0&amp;user_select3=0&amp;user_sort=Go\" class=\"postlink\">iso</a>.  Up until his <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4691958#p4691958\" class=\"postlink\">unvote</a> in iso #9, he hadn't said anything not about Slandaar without direct prompting to do so since he'd started posting about him in iso #1.  The only somewhat positive thing he said about Slandaar was an edit he made to his unvote post before posting it.  The unvote was absolutely out of nowhere.  Imagine you were eating pretzels and you reached into the bag and pulled out a sock.  That sock is Om's unvote and that bag of pretzels in Om's posts.  If you disagree though, just read his <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4692024#p4692024\" class=\"postlink\">next</a> two <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4692050#p4692050\" class=\"postlink\">posts</a>.  It doesn't look like even he knows what he's saying in that first post.  Did he unvote because he was feeling better about Slandaar or because other people have told him Slandaar is town and he wants to read Slandaar's games first?  Of course, all that goes away when he makes the second post 9 minutes later.  He's made up his mind by then - Slandaar looks townish and it would be pointless to vote someone who's already explained himself.<br>\n<br>\nIt's gonna take a hell of a lot to convince me that any of that came from a townie.  If he'd unvoted Slandaar and instantly voted a second scum read on which he thought his vote was better placed, then maybe....but unvoting Slandaar in the midst of saying all sorts of thing he finds scummy about him and then coming up with a combination of quickly-changing reasons for doing so?  We wanted pretzels and we got a sock.

That's the reason why I find you to be following him and why I don't find myself following Mr.Frog. I see your point, but I disagree that it's the same degree of following someone.<br>\n<br>\n===<br>\n<br>\nApparently, this Slandaar vs Om wagon is getting hot. I'm going to keep my vote on Jenn until I can get a better read on both Slandaar and Om.<br>\n<br>\nLike I mentioned before, I'm going to state again that I am getting more of a town read on Om. I feel that he was caught in a corner and ended up in this scenario.<br>\n<br>\nI REALLY want to say that I'm getting a scummy read from Slandaar, but I can't. He's been claiming that Om's a scum, kthxbye's a scum, and I'm a scum. He only provided a meta evidence on kthxbye (and a weak one at that) while flat out calling her a scum. Meanwhile, he has a legitimate attack going on on Om (for a good reason that I can understand). Even more, he disputes for 2 posts about how I am scummy based on our exchange about how town does not need to look for excuses or reasons. He's been attacking everything and everyone that moves from what I can tell.<br>\n<br>\nI find his language (he tends to use strong statements and be overaggressive toward everything) scummy. I meta-checked Slandaar and he seems to use strong language in all the games he plays. Additionally, I feel like scum would not try to be so aggressive and lead so many attacks at the same time. I can't believe I'm saying this, but I'm getting an overall town read from Slandaar.", "time": "Sun Feb 03, 2013 4:19 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=25526&start=175", "forum": "53", "thread": "25526"}

Let me clarify quickly:<br>\n<br>\nI said that he was making strong statements and that he was overaggressive. I had to meta-check him to confirm that his language was normally this way (I confirmed that he was). His overaggressiveness makes him more town because scums generally wouldn't want to initiate hot debates and make cases against multiple people at the same time.<br>\n<br>\nI was saying that I WANTED to say that he was scummy because I really don't like how black and white his statements are.

Unvoting your top suspect without having anyone new to vote and while still seemingly calling him scum just does not happen.  I can't see a townish mindset in which it would happen, I don't think I've ever seen it happen, your explanations don't make any reasonable sense of why it would happen.  Add that to your contradictory follow-up posts and...well...let's just say it makes me feel like you would look cute with a rope tied around your neck.  And not in the good way.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nThe Ztrife-Om vote exchange seems really awkward from both sides.  I have a feeling that interaction will be useful to look back on later<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nI feel like there's a rather large ongoing theory disconnect between Elleran and...multiple other players (I think that might be what I was referring to in my last post, but I don't actually remember.).  Or at the very least, there are some wording things going on that seem to be getting lost in communication.  These issues started within the first few pages with the whole reasons vs excuses debate; now we seem to have it again with the town-looking-for-reasons thing.  For the moment, I'm definitely at least leaning town on Elleran.  I'm not really sure how to explain why (and I don't think it would be particularly useful with only one vote on him anyway), but I feel like a lot of his play feels very natural if you get past the wording and theory oddities.  I don't know.  Certainly not my strongest read in either direction.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nBlah blah blah other stuff OKAY IMPORTANT STUFF NOW.  I would like to speak on the subject of JOEL.  I would like to, but the guy doesn't post any content so there's barely anything to say about him.  When he does post, we get nothing out of him but weakly-stated positions.  It feels like he's been trying very hard to give the impression that he's active lurking, but not posting enough to do so, which reminds me very much of a dead squirrel trying to convince a dog he's actually a flea.  I don't like dead squirrels and I don't like dead squirrels that try to pose as fleas.<br>\n...Man that explanation got off track quickly.  Other than the fact that I don't think he's *trying* to appear like he's active lurking, hopefully it's clear enough anyway.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Unvote: Om</div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: joelsdaman1</div><br>\n<br>\nI haven't forgotten about you Om.  I just think we need to go our separate ways for the time being.  Really though, it's not you; it's me.  I feel like life is passing me by and I need to explore my other opportunities while I still have the chance.  We're young, but we're not young enough.  We're never young enough.  That's just kind of how life goes, isn't it?  I truly and sincerely will miss you.  Please don't doubt that.  I hope that some day in the future, we will be reunited.  Please don't doubt that.  Even now, it pains me to know that such a reuniting is all I have to look forward to in our future and I really wish it not be bittersweet if and when it should come.  Thank you for the good times and great memories.  I can think of no one I would rather have shared them with and, given the chance to do it over, I would choose to share them with you again.  I hope you can find it in your heart to not think too ill of me for this.

But at the same time, he did vote for Trollie in the post containing the first quote, so it still seems plausible. More plausible to me than Trollie changing his tactic of how he approaches scumhunting. It just seems that if he was really someone who walls to scumhunt, he would have continued. Even if he ran out of time and that's why he stopped, he never mentioned that and he never went back to walling/analyzing each detail like he did before when he did get more time. The only way that makes sense to me is if his goal is not to scumhunt but to give the appearance of it.<br>\n<br>\nI would prefer to lynch Trollie today. But if we can't get a consensus on him, I would consider Joel, Kthx, and Ztife. Probably Ztife first before the other two.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Ztife</div> hasn't gotten much scrutiny yet (he hasn't posted much), but what he does have is pretty bad. <br>\n1.

In that same post he calls Joel a null-to-scum read but doesn't vote Joel (and he didn't provide any further comment on Om that would make sense that he would keep his vote there)<br>\n4. Ztife posts again after Om informs the mod that he's replacing out, but Ztife still doesn't move his vote from Om even though it's on a now inactive spot.<br>\n<br>\nIn short, Ztife has spent no time scumhunting and appears to be doing the bare minimum to skate by to last the day.", "time": "Wed Feb 06, 2013 9:42 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=25526&start=325", "forum": "53", "thread": "25526"}

Slandaar looks townie.<br>\n<br>\nProblems: Your town read on Nacho, who's predecessor voted and then expected the town to give reasons for her and then lurked to replacement before she ever explained her vote or even why she wanted others to do it for her - Nacho himself has done pretty much nothing but jump onto the terminal Elleran wagon because it was there. I'd like to see more from Nacho before making a more decisive call, but I certainly don't get a town read here.<br>\nYour claim that my vote back onto Elleran was forced is simply wrong. Also, rich coming form the scummiest vote on that wagon.<br>\nWhich leads back to you: Your analysis relies, in large part, on people believing you're town. Your actions make this hard: Vote hopping (onto Trollie, jennifer, joels and elleran) onto only existing wagons (with the exception of your first joels random vote), never initiating anything. 342's looks like an attempt to set up consecutive lynches - its intriguing how your willing to lynch joels who you repeatedly say you think is town.<br>\n<br>\nTake out your assumed towniness and your town read on Nacho and your analyses' conclusion has much less validity. I think that GM or nacho may be the play for today, their approaches to the day will shed some light on which one (if not both) it is.<br>\n<br>\nFor now, other things.<br>\n<br>\nI don't get Jennifer's supposed scumminess. I've reread the thread, and her in iso. I just don't see it. Someone care to explain?<br>\n<br>\nOm/Psyche - Comes out of argument with Slandaar poorly, that unvote was weird and looks like whipped scum. His replacement, Psyche, has done little more than sheep Kthx (of all the people to sheep, really) and discuss the nights goings on. Scumminess resides here.<br>\n<br>\nZtife - Bad vote on Om, acknowledges that its bad. Doesn't take it away. Closest he gets to calling anyone else scummy is to accuse joels of being a fence sitting lurker, which is said from his on comfy lurker seat on the fence. Pot calling the kettle black yes? Yes. Not enough to get a solid read, this worries me and leads to:<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Ztife</span><br>\n<br>\nPressure here needs to happen, he can't be allowed to slip through this day.", "time": "Mon Feb 11, 2013 10:14 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=25526&start=425", "forum": "53", "thread": "25526"}

The request to lynch Trollie was not over scumhood, but was a test of the waters of a policy lynch. It was never commital, and Elleran's decision to switch to kthxbye so soon after the request as a shift from tunneling on Trollie for several posts just confirms that.

This is going to sound stupid, possibly because it is, but the impression I was getting off of him was that of someone quietly whispering to stray townies about massclaim under the voice of objections - like a clich&#233;d scene of a single underling secretly staging a rebellion against a Big Brother-esque watching-you kind of Man.  That was what prompted my \"Failure to produce a reason or to drop this may as well be a scum claim.\"  I figured that by that point, a townie would be willing to explain the merits of this plan he so firmly believed in, instead of completely ignoring disagreement and hoping a hypothetical vig would suicide out of nowhere by claiming in response to his demand.  His response was to give a possible benefit of a massclaim that ignored the primary objections that had been publicly raised and to more or less call me scum.

Your uncomfortable usage of the phrase here (along with \"uncertainty\" disclaimer you finished with) makes me think your post could be an example of this.<br>\n<br>\nSecond thing here. The request to lynch Trollie was not over scumhood, but was a test of the waters of a policy lynch. It was never commital, and Elleran's decision to switch to kthxbye so soon after the request as a shift from tunneling on Trollie for several posts just confirms that.

It was a huge jump; you'd defended him just a couple posts beforehand. But there was a tide, and you saw a chance. Opportunism, not crap, is what attracts me to you. Who is attracted to crap? That's not evolutionarily adaptive at all. &gt;.&gt;<br>\n<br>\nAnd when confronted about this opportunism, your response has been sooo weak. It literally doesn't make sense. The principles of rationality are violated thoroughly. Why? Because you're looking for a way out but there isn't one.

{"number": 865, "id": "4740810", "user": "Malakittens", "user_id": "19101", "content": "Roar.<br>\n<br>\nSo, looking at Joel. I read his first post as cryptic because it's not really sure what he was referring too due to lack of content. Though, I have to agree with him that sometimes it's a town-tell to hop around wagons, but other times it's not. I think it's too early right now to call someone town for that.<br>\nThe fact he also says anyone who isn't on the action draws his attention, but he's not really in on the action himself.<br>\n(Watch Listed)<br>\n<br>\nI like Jennifer's post 42. <br>\nI also believe it's a nice hiding spot for scum to just go after lurkers.<br>\n<br>\nIs it just me, but I do not understand Rondar's vote on Jennifer. I feel as if it's ill placed. I'm not even sure if he has a reason for voting her. He says he does, but doesn't say it outloud. Guessing games suck.<br>\n<br>\nSlandaar: What kind of useless questions is that? (53)<br>\n<br>\nWarming up to the fact DRK is scum. Not for sheeping for Rondar, but for being so damn sketchy. Huge gut feel, FoS.<br>\n<br>\nReally, Kthx. He is town, why?<br>\n<br>\nDRK's post 84 has given me yet another scum ping. Mainly due to keeping reads close to the chest which could future give a great reason to hop votes. <br>\n<br>\nNice, I hate my own slot's post 88. Complaining about pages to read overnight/during the day is really scummy to me. I have recently seen some scum players complain about it. <br>\n<br>\nSlandaar's OMGUS towards my own slot. Wtf.<br>\nSo what was your purpose of asking GM those questions? What did you get out of it? Seemed like useless filler posts to me.<br>\n<br>\nTook you so long to answer that until poked. I would have gave my results of a reaction test right away.<br>\n<br>\nHmmm. Not sure what to make of the last line of DRK's post 104. <br>\nI already know my own alignment, but if I was a speculator looking in - I would have been convinced that this post is a telegraphed 'HEY SCUM BUDDY CALM THE HELL DOWN'.<br>\n<br>\nOkay Jennifer definitely feels town. I don't get the wagon on her. I think it's scum motivated. If I had to pick the scum on the wagon it's DRK.<br>\n<br>\nKthx - way to ping the radar. Seriously. You were town last game we played and you were bitching about the lack of content, but now you are doing opposite. (FoS)<br>\n<br>\n... @ GM's last post. Feels like he's just trying to post something without really trying. It feels forced. <br>\n(Watch List)<br>\n<br>\nJason I have the urge to kick you. /Kicks Jason.<br>\n<br>\nOHGUISE- Slandaar saw the same thing I did. At first his post reminded me of the same game where he called my Mason Partner scum and then never elaborated, but this time he did.<br>\n<br>\nOkay Joel's post 183 is opportunistic as hell. (FoS)<br>\n<br>\nKthx - I don't like how you came back to post a post that was directed at you. Nice you come when called. <br>\n<br>\nQ21 feels town. I like how he unvotes when he feels his vote isn't in the right place. He's applying pressure.<br>\n<br>\nZtife's post is um, bad. He jumps on one of the biggest wagon's without reading or posting content. (FoS)<br>\n<br>\nOkay, Slandaar might be town. Saying might because he's applying pressure and he's in my head. <div style=\"font-size: 50%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">(GETOUTOFMYHEADMAN)</div><br>\nThe fact Kthx is trying to put meta on another different player is disturbing. Not two people are the same - don't ever trying to apply one play style to someone totally different.<br>\n<br>\nI <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">kinda</div> like DRK's post 257. I don't get the reason why she would put the damn metaphor into it. It's basically adding nothing. Feels as if she's trying to give too much explanation for a vote that could be explained without going round-round.<br>\nLet's see if she follows up on the Z-Om exchange in another post.<br>\n<br>\nOh, okay that's it. I had enough.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"> Vote: DRK </div><br>\n<br>\nZ is fencesitting and his post #270 is noncommittal. (FoS)<br>\n<br>\nIf I had two votes. I'd vote you along with DRK.<br>\n<br>\nWhat the actual fuck. Kthx - that hammer was HORRID. That is completely scummy as fuck.<br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\nCare to explain your reasons on voting Q21, Kthx and even DRK? I'd ask Pysche, but I'm his current replacement. <br>\n<br>\nKthx's. I said it last game and I'll say it again. The hammer you did comes off shady and maybe I don't like lynching without giving time to claim. You know if Eller actually happened to be PR - I'd put fire on your ass right now. This is not town play to just randomly hammer.<br>\n<br>\nI also don't like the part of your post that says well I can see Q or GM going either way. Feels like a lax attempt of giving a nice jump in the future to either wagon if they started to build.<br>\n<br>\n@Jen:<br>\n<br>\nIt's like saying it's to bold of a move to be a scum move.<br>\n<br>\n@Q21: If you think scum is on the wagon why are you voting for someone off the wagon? <br>\n<br>\n/stabs Jason. Die.<br>\n<br>\n@Nacho: I don't see how Z or Joel is town. I dislike your lack of explanations. Explain, please?<br>\n<br>\nAlso, why can't it be a bad vig? Why does it have to be a SK?<br>\n<br>\n@Kwll: <br>\n<br>\nYou say we are good on activity, but basically toss out a vote that's entirely meta related, but no comments on anything else that has happened during Day 1 or current day. What?<br>\n<br>\n@Slandaar:<br>\n<br>\nWhatttt da fuck. Why are you trying to out the vig.<br>\n<br>\nDKR is being too twitchy and very paranoid regarding the massclaim. I think she has something to hide. Possibly three things for that; she's either scum, a SK or the vig itself.<br>\n<br>\n@GM:<br>\n<br>\nNice. Let's sheep a really bad vote by Kwll that's strictly doing nothing to help us out. Also sheeping DKR who is being sketchy as hell.<br>\n<br>\n@Kwll:<br>\n<br>\nPost a damn read other than Slandaar. <br>\n<br>\n@DRK: Gauh. Out of my head, kthx?<br>\n<br>\nDear lord. The Nacho vs Slandaar hurts my eyes. It looks town vs. town as hell.<br>\n<br>\n@whoever:<br>\n<br>\nI still don't see how Z is town.<br>\n<br>\nOkay Kwll is scummy as fuck. First game he replaced in as town he at least attempted to read. He didn't vote someone based on a shitty meta case and he's seriously disinterested as fuck. He hasn't given a single read out other than Slandaar. (Okay, now I see some reads coming out)<br>\n<br>\nHe's hopped onto high wagons and has quickly gotten off of them. The read on Psyche seems opportunistic as fuck since people has aired suspicion on that slot. He's looking at Z, but hasn't really given a clear read. Has GM as a town read based on meta - nothing really other than gut, meta and nothing related to this game specifically.<br>\n<br>\nHe defends Q by asking why do people want him lynched and then jumps onto the wagon.<br>\n<br>\n(If Q is scum - which I really am not certain - I think Kwll is his partner)<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"> Vote: Kwll </div><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nSoooooooooooo, basically.<br>\n<br>\nI have this as reads:<br>\n<br>\nScum Pool:<br>\n<br>\nKwll <br>\nDRK<br>\nGM<br>\nZ<br>\nKthx<br>\n<br>\nTown Pool:<br>\n<br>\nSlandaar<br>\nNacho<br>\nJen<br>\n<br>\nNull-leaning town Pool:<br>\n<br>\nQ21", "time": "Fri Feb 22, 2013 6:06 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=25526&start=850", "forum": "53", "thread": "25526"}

We talked a little, but not much, last night. I don't have a scum read on her. My main hesitation at putting her in the town slot is the fact that we're neighbors. I tried reading up on neighbors as much as possible to figure out if it means auto-scum and it doesn't (seems the consensus is that it's only when you have at least 3 in a neighborhood that 1 is likely def scum). <br>\n<br>\nI'm starting to suspect Psyche/Mala for scum (and weclome, Mala! Thanks for replacing in!) Psyche was definitely charismatic and fun to read, but I think that part of that flair was masking scumminess. There was one part that jumped out at me where people were asking Psyche to re-state his case, and he wouldn't .. which seemed odd. Because even if he didn't want to pull up his old post, he should have able/wanting to simply restate it, at least in a simplified format and he hadn't.<br>\n<br>\nBut before voting as we've come this far, I want to get claims from everyone (waiting on Kwll, DRK, and conf from GM) and then try to piece it together with the roles/people's posts.", "time": "Sat Feb 23, 2013 5:48 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=25526&start=925", "forum": "53", "thread": "25526"}

At this point we hope to shit that scum that doesn't have a roleblocker because that would mean we just screwed our power roles over entirely.<br>\n<br>\nWhat I was going to say yesterday (IRL yesterday) if I'd actually posted was that, in my 1-2-years-out-of-date-knowledge-of-site-meta, doctor and scum are, in order, the two most common fakeclaims, and also happen to be two powerful roles that don't often get put into minis together (and that, last I checked, people were moving away from putting cops in minis at all).  Then I was going to say that q21's \"Wow, you guys suck at this game, except the scum, they're really good.\" inside his claim post was scummy as fuck.  My memory might just be faulty, but I don't think I've ever seen someone say something like that in a claim post and be town.  That's why I didn't unvote after his claim.<br>\n<br>\nHis day 2 posts don't contain anything I would consider to be in conflict with a night 1 town investigation of Kthx (the thing meowakittens said was in conflict with his claimed investigation was not actually at all in conflict with it), so at the very least, that checks out.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nNow that we've basically outed all our roles, here's how things break down balance-wise:<br>\n<br>\nThe old 2goon vs 5 townies + doc + cop semi-open newbie setup was incredibly town-sided.

Basically, scum would know before town what the setup was and still got mauled when that setup came up.  Taking away the semi-open nature of the setup to put it into a closed game probably doesn't change things much.  It might help scum a bit depending on believability of claims.  Adding 1 scum and 3 townies to extend to 13p tilts the game toward scum's favor.  Adding in a tracker, a vig, and neighbors....yeah, that tilts the game crazy amounts into town's favor.  Even with a potential mafia roleblocker/rolecop/whatever, that is a HUGE amount of town power.  Needless to say, assuming we actually have a vig, at least one of the cop and doc is lying (removing tracker from that setup would not be enough to balance the game...removing the doctor might balance the game if scum have a lot of power).  If we don't have a vig, then....I don't really know how balance in a 1-2-10/1-3-9 setup works out.  Do people actually use serial killers in mini normals?

I do find it odd that Kwll hasn't claimed, but I find it worse that you are going after him just for that. You are calling him a lurker on top of not claiming, but you also aren't directly stating it. I don't like when people just go after lurkers because I feel as if it's a safe spot for scum to place votes and to make a case without directly getting attention to them because they are perceived as helping when they really aren't.<br>\n<br>\nHow hard did you try and change GM's mind about his vig target yesterday? How did he respond?<br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\nI'd like GM to respond to the last part of the post I directed at Jen. How hard did Jen try and change your mind and how did she respond when you responded to her?<br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\nI'm not going to vote as of yet. I need to reread interactions between Q21 and other players to see who his likely partner<div style=\"display:inline-flex;text-decoration:line-through\"> is/are. I would have done that during the night phrase, but I have had my attention elsewhere because school does come first and the spare time I had was trying to fight off an illness that just reared it's ugly head.</div>", "time": "Thu Feb 28, 2013 9:55 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=25526&start=1000", "forum": "53", "thread": "25526"}

I'm reasonably certain they were someone else's opinions on *something*, with one of the opinions leading to the conclusion that Om/Psyche was scum and one leading to the conclusion that Slandaar was scum.

Not really that but the idea is the same.<br>\n<br>\nAround that point i was deciding to just not care about either Slandaar or Psyche - if Slandaar was actually doctor, he was going to die and hooray woohoo happy day scum nightkills read him for me.  But oh man did I want to strangle myself every time I read a post after that of someone saying they still thought Slandaar was scum.  No, we do not need to give scum a reason not to kill him if he's town.  No no no no no.  No. <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\">  Then we massclaimed.  Let's all agree never to massclaim in a mini normal on day 2 again unless under very very special circumstances okay?  I was somewhat needlessly worried about the possibility at that point of a possible scum roleblocker blocking hypothetical Slandaar town doctor to just bypass him entirely and take out the directly threatening roles, but in hindsight that didn't even make sense because blocking the vig would almost definitely be better because it would keep the town stuck on evens and give scum an extra nightkill.  Unless WHO CARES UNLESS WHAT, NOT ME.  BUT YEAH, I spent most of day 2 not passing judgment on Psyche or Slandaar at all because scum would have to sort it out anyway and THEY DID.  Also, the above mess of a blurb of explanation should explain why not Psyche in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4727461#p4727461\" class=\"postlink\">this post</a>.<br>\n<br>\nTBH by the end of the day I probably should have just bothered to try to read them instead of waiting for night 2 to sort it out but gg no re ribbit ribbit it doesn't matter and scum served itself up on a silver platter by the end of day 2 anyway.  It was delicious and so are my legs, or so I've heard.  I wouldn't eat frog legs because I'm not a cannibal.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nIso me if you want to find why I was voting Om initially but hint: it was because he suddenly took a stance that made no sense when he realized he was on the wrong side of the Berlin Wall.  That's right, Reagan said things and Gorbachev did some demolition and JFK was a jelly doughnut but not really.<br>\n<br>\nI have like zero clue what Psyche did in this game.  I know he posted some stuff and then made a case and then talked about it a bunch, but he really wasn't a central character anyway.  He was the butler so of course he's supposed to turn out to be a killer but then you find out it was actually the maid and she has <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">boobs</div> so who really cares about the butler?  Except that analogy doesn't make sense here because I'm only talking about one person and they are all the butler and they are the killer.<br>\n<br>\nThen Psyche left and it probably had something to do with peanut butter and Meowakittens joined in and posted <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4740810#p4740810\" class=\"postlink\">this</a> and what in the I don't even she calls her own slot scummy like 3 times...nvm I just counted and it's 2 times and I can't even imagine what kind of thought process would have to go into a town post to produce an output that I'm pretty sure just reads \"well shit, I'm scum\" plus or minus suspecting 5/9 players and attacking any post in which I went off on a tangent.  Not gonna lie, I can be a pretty damn easy target early in the game if I take things too far and I don't think any of Meowmeowkittens' reads changed after like page 5.  INTERESTING.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nSO YEAH, this is where I would lay down a dramatic vote and announce the L-1 that Ztife just took away, but seriously I think we would be more likely to get a quickhammer out of kwll's slot than a claim if he comes back, and, regardless of what his alignement is, now would be a bueno time to know if we need to massively change our assumptions of the game.</span>", "time": "Sat Mar 02, 2013 2:09 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=25526&start=1025", "forum": "53", "thread": "25526"}

Real pro town play.<br>\nFrogger also reads fairly town.<br>\n<br>\nIf I get things right, the claimed power roles are Doc / Vig / Tracker, right? In case of three scum, that seems balanced for town. In case of a SK, Doc + Tracker actually seems somewhat weak for town, so I'm inclined to believe we have a Vig and not a SK.

The reasoning for the vote wasn't particularly strong (especially because Kwll flaked), it seemed more like a placeholder vote. It seems odd to me that someone would refrain from doing actual relevant votes when big issues were going on.<br>\n- MalaKittens commented at some point that she didn't want to do setup discussion. I find this to be bogus. The reason setup discussion is bad for town is because it helps scum find power roles. But after a massclaim that's irrelevant so setup discussion can only help town. This might have already been said though (seems obvious enough) but I didn't see it.<br>\nAt the start of Day 2 Psyche commented that 'scum wouldn't kill TheTrollie'. I don't know what to make of that, it seems really awkward.<br>\n<br>\nThat's what I got so far.

The only time that he moved you from a scum read to a town read was based on massclaim discussion. <br>\n<br>\nBasically my reads are as follows:<br>\n<br>\nPossible Town: (highest to lowest)<br>\n<br>\nGM - Q21 was determined to get him lynched.

Nacho could have led the charge on Q21 knowing that there was a chance that Q21 was going down anyways. Only problem was the switch between the lists.

Very few people actually walk away from mafia when they say they're going to.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nI still suspect this setup was just bad for town.  When I thought the setup was tracker+doc+vig-townie neighbor pair vs 3 goons, I thought the game was somewhat town-sided, but not unbearably so.  But with an SK in place of the vig...<br>\n<br>\nNeighbor is a fun role that I usually really like.  People enjoy talking at night (well, most people do), so it's fun to play as, and how useful of a role it is for town depends on how well the town neighbor(s) manage(s) to use it (as opposed to a role like cop, where you investigate someone and get useful information no matter what).  But a town neighbor tied to an SK is a bit iffy.  An SK-neighbor is potentially at a pretty decent disadvantage.  SK is already a very difficult role to win with (especially with no immunities) and probably shouldn't be part of a neighborhood.  From the town side of things, having a town neighbor tied to an SK neighbor is less valuable than having a town neighbor tied to a mafia neighbor or having a pair of town neighbors.  An SK is certainly a scum faction, but overall less dangerous and worrisome than a mafia team (for most of the game, at least).<br>\n<br>\nHaving that neighbor + tracker + doctor vs 3 goons and an SK definitely seems weak to me.  Town mislynched day 1, followed by 3 straight mafia lynches.  It's pretty rough for that to not be good enough for a town win in a mini.  The fact that the game did end up being so close was largely because of the inherently self-balancing nature of having multiple scum factions - the better one faction does, the more the other factions target it.  Town was doing well, so goodmorning took out townies to improve her odds.  The game shouldn't have been close in terms of strictly mafia vs town.  Town should have been steamrolling the mafia, but the SK just hurt the town too much.  It's partly just the nature of SKs in minis, but it's also partly town not having enough power here to deal with the number of threats they had to get rid of.<br>\n<br>\nJust to make sure I'm not getting the wrong point across, I'm not taking anything away from goodmorning here.  Winning as no-immunity SK-neighbor in a mini normal is not at all an easy feat and she deserved her win.  I'm just not sure town had a fair chance overall in this game.<br>\n<br>\nOther than that though, the modding was overall smooth.  Generally frequent and accurate votecounts, prods and replacements handled promptly, flavor was good when I was unlazy enough to read it (I'm really really lazy about reading flavor, sorry &gt;.&gt;).  I still think the kwll situation was handled poorly, but it didn't end up impacting the game, so no harm done.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n@Meowmeow/q21<br>\nIt was fun being scummy scums with you and I would scumscum the scum with you two again~  Sorry for my lame buses on the two of you and hopefully you're not mad that I kind of gave up on the last day.  I wouldn't have done that if I felt I had any chance there.  One day we should group up to form the Scum4u company and use it to organize murders while pretending to give out free hugs.  And we can also give out free hugs.
