The site wide rules apply<br>2. Play to your win condition<br>3. We are all here to have fun, avoid personal attacks, attack a players play instead<br>4. Do not impersonate or pretend to be the moderator. My colour <span style=\"color: #FF0000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">is this Red</span></span><br>5. Do not edit or delete your posts in this thread. If there is a problem with a post, such as incorrect formatting, ask me to fix it for you.<br>6. Do not quote communications outside the game thread, including role PMs, quicktopics, etc., in the game thread. This specifically includes PM timestamps. Paraphrasing is allowed. If in doubt, ask.<br>7. Unless I have specifically told you it is allowed, do not talk about this game outside of this game thread until it is completed.<br>8. Do not use cryptography, invisible text, tiny text, or the like.<br>9. Do not use any form of provable randomness. Claiming you rolled dice and acting on that is fine. Using dice tags is not.<br>10. Do not bring outside factors into this game. This includes, among other things, making bets, promises of real life rewards, etc.<br>11.  Claiming scum by yourself is fine. Claiming scum with others is not, regardless of the truth of this claim.<br>12. Pretending to break a rule will be treated the same as breaking the rule.<br>13. Breaking one of these rules may, at my discretion, result in a modkill. If you are modkilled, you will become a Neutral Survivor, and thus automatically lose. Modkilling may or may not end the game day.<br>14. No set of rules can be all-encompassing. I reserve the right to take any action at any time, for any reason. However, I try to be extremely reasonable. If you have any questions about the game, rules, or players, please ask me via PM.<br><br><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Activity Rules</span><br>1. If a player goes 72 real life hours without posting or 48 hours on request, they will be prodded at my discretion, Prods will be announced in thread.<br>2. A Proded player has 48 hours to respond to said prod if they don\u2019t they will be replaced<br>3. If you receive 3 prods in one game day then you will be replaced.<br>4. Each game day will have a deadline of 14 real life days (2 weeks)<br>5. In the event a deadline is reached before a lynch then a <span class=\"noboldsig\">No Lynch</span> will occur.<br>6. Each night will have a deadline of 3 real life days (72 hours)<br>7. If a player has a night action and fails to submit before the deadline, no action will be performed by that player<br>8. Deadlines may be extended in the case of replacements but this will be at my own discretion.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Voting Rules</span><br>1. Votes must be at the beginning of a new line, using vote tags or <span class=\"noboldsig\">bold</span> (<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Player name</span>/<span class=\"noboldsig\">VOTE: Player name</span>). If you do not wish to lynch, you may <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: No Lynch</span>/<span class=\"noboldsig\">VOTE: No Lynch</span>. Abbreviations, missing punctuation, and misspellings will be accepted as long as it is obvious to me who is being voted for. If I perceive it as a vote, it counts as a vote.<br>2. It is not necessary to explicitly unvote (<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: Player name</span>/<span class=\"noboldsig\">UNVOTE: Player name</span>) before voting someone else, though it is preferred.<br>3. Once a majority of votes is reached (# of players / 2 + 1, rounded down), that person is lynched. <br>4.  All living players, including the lynchee, may continue to post until I lock the thread.<br>5. If you are dead, You may make one post with no game related content (a bah post) during the next day."}

Although some of his language is exaggerated, Slandaar is no longer relying on as much RVS evidence and more about Om's reactions and his language.<br><br>Starting from further back:<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4691228#p4691228\" class=\"postlink\">post 95</a>, Slandaar wrote:</cite>If he wants me to post there must be a reason behind it; it was 1 hour into game start so why does he want me to post? does he think I am not going to post without him voting me? (obviously not)</div></blockquote><br><br>Slandaar is reasonable here. There still were and still are some players who have NOT posted a single thing yet, but Om and DannFlor pressed Slandaar to talk. rather than anybody else.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">PEDIT: WOW... the rate at which Slandaar vs Om thing is developing is insane. I started writing this and realized that the whole thing concluded before I could finish my thought. I'll try to summarize my thoughts.</span><br><br>Okay...<br>Om defends himself by cross examining Slandaar and asking him to explain himself. However, Om's response was (as Slandaar stated) not well thought out.<br>Om's recent unvote is also scummy. From what I can see, it can either be one of the following two things:<br>1) Scum withdrawing his vote when under heavy pressure from Slandaar due to lack of evidence.<br>2) Townie withdrawing his vote because he doesn't think arguing to keep his vote isn't worth the effort.<br><br>I don't want to call a black and white answer (unlike Slandaar's claim that Om MUST be scum), but I am leaning toward number 1. To me, Om's been attacking Slandaar based on what Om perceives as random or strange responses to his questions. Because Om's original attack came from <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4690782#p4690782\" class=\"postlink\">post 88</a> (the post basically attacks Slandaar based on his questions that he asked others), I find Om's attack to be weak. I found Slandaar's questions addressed to others perfectly reasonable and worth asking (such as someone's favorite role) and found your sudden attack on him suspicious. Continuing, Om continued to argue against Slandaar based on evidences that originated in a much earlier and god-forbid-RVS, Om was forced to either continue to argue and lose or unvote and become suspicious.<br><br>My final verdict? I find Om's actions to be scummy but I also feel like Om just put himself in a situation in which he could NOT escape without a negative consequence hitting him. Basically, he cornered himself, whether he's town or not. Not a complete scumtell, but a mistake worth noting.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Unvote: TheTrollie</span><br><br>(unvote because it's time to get off the train)<br><br>===<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Regarding Jennifer and Dannflor:</span><br><br>As Mr.Frog has stated already, Jenn's <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4689159#p4689159\" class=\"postlink\">post 22</a> came off as scummy (which I agreed with).<br><br>I get a sense that Jenn is reluctant to attack Dunnflor.

Up until his <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4691958#p4691958\" class=\"postlink\">unvote</a> in iso #9, he hadn't said anything not about Slandaar without direct prompting to do so since he'd started posting about him in iso #1.  The only somewhat positive thing he said about Slandaar was an edit he made to his unvote post before posting it.  The unvote was absolutely out of nowhere.  Imagine you were eating pretzels and you reached into the bag and pulled out a sock.  That sock is Om's unvote and that bag of pretzels in Om's posts.  If you disagree though, just read his <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4692024#p4692024\" class=\"postlink\">next</a> two <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4692050#p4692050\" class=\"postlink\">posts</a>.  It doesn't look like even he knows what he's saying in that first post.  Did he unvote because he was feeling better about Slandaar or because other people have told him Slandaar is town and he wants to read Slandaar's games first?  Of course, all that goes away when he makes the second post 9 minutes later.  He's made up his mind by then - Slandaar looks townish and it would be pointless to vote someone who's already explained himself.<br><br>It's gonna take a hell of a lot to convince me that any of that came from a townie.  If he'd unvoted Slandaar and instantly voted a second scum read on which he thought his vote was better placed, then maybe....but unvoting Slandaar in the midst of saying all sorts of thing he finds scummy about him and then coming up with a combination of quickly-changing reasons for doing so?

He just unvoted recently. I look forward to what you have to say later tonight.<br><br>===<br><br>I like q21's reasoning. Although jumping on a wagon is scummy, having your vote on someone whose wagon is losing popularity just simply isn't useful for either scums or town. I didn't smell anything scummy from q21's post.<br><br>===<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Regarding Jennifer</span>: I still find it odd that Jenn tried to accuse me so hard even though others had dropped out for some time. Because I feel that if Jenn was a scum, she would have gotten off the wagon long before it had lost popularity, but instead she stayed until the very end, I am actually getting some town read on her now.<br><br>@Jenn: The only time I followed Mr.Frog was my vote change onto Trollie for no reason at all. You on the other hand changed your vote onto me for a somewhat more serious reason after Dann had changed his vote to me. That's the reason why I find you to be following him and why I don't find myself following Mr.Frog. I see your point, but I disagree that it's the same degree of following someone.<br><br>===<br><br>Apparently, this Slandaar vs Om wagon is getting hot. I'm going to keep my vote on Jenn until I can get a better read on both Slandaar and Om.<br><br>Like I mentioned before, I'm going to state again that I am getting more of a town read on Om. I feel that he was caught in a corner and ended up in this scenario.<br><br>I REALLY want to say that I'm getting a scummy read from Slandaar, but I can't. He's been claiming that Om's a scum, kthxbye's a scum, and I'm a scum. He only provided a meta evidence on kthxbye (and a weak one at that) while flat out calling her a scum. Meanwhile, he has a legitimate attack going on on Om (for a good reason that I can understand). Even more, he disputes for 2 posts about how I am scummy based on our exchange about how town does not need to look for excuses or reasons. He's been attacking everything and everyone that moves from what I can tell.<br><br>I find his language (he tends to use strong statements and be overaggressive toward everything) scummy. I meta-checked Slandaar and he seems to use strong language in all the games he plays. Additionally, I feel like scum would not try to be so aggressive and lead so many attacks at the same time. I can't believe I'm saying this, but I'm getting an overall town read from Slandaar."}

Let me clarify quickly:<br><br>I said that he was making strong statements and that he was overaggressive.

His overaggressiveness makes him more town because scums generally wouldn't want to initiate hot debates and make cases against multiple people at the same time.<br><br>I was saying that I WANTED to say that he was scummy because I really don't like how black and white his statements are.

I just choose to try and not take one post and make it fit a scummy vibe and go after that person for it, I choose to take the sum of posts and see what my gut tells me about them (seem forced, fake, mis-rep'ed, etc).  <br><br>@Ell:  No i can't, it's a vibe I get from reading them as a whole.

Unvoting your top suspect without having anyone new to vote and while still seemingly calling him scum just does not happen.  I can't see a townish mindset in which it would happen, I don't think I've ever seen it happen, your explanations don't make any reasonable sense of why it would happen.  Add that to your contradictory follow-up posts and...well...let's just say it makes me feel like you would look cute with a rope tied around your neck.  And not in the good way.<br><br><br>The Ztrife-Om vote exchange seems really awkward from both sides.

Or at the very least, there are some wording things going on that seem to be getting lost in communication.  These issues started within the first few pages with the whole reasons vs excuses debate; now we seem to have it again with the town-looking-for-reasons thing.  For the moment, I'm definitely at least leaning town on Elleran.  I'm not really sure how to explain why (and I don't think it would be particularly useful with only one vote on him anyway), but I feel like a lot of his play feels very natural if you get past the wording and theory oddities.  I don't know.  Certainly not my strongest read in either direction.<br><br><br>Blah blah blah other stuff OKAY IMPORTANT STUFF NOW.  I would like to speak on the subject of JOEL.  I would like to, but the guy doesn't post any content so there's barely anything to say about him.  When he does post, we get nothing out of him but weakly-stated positions.  It feels like he's been trying very hard to give the impression that he's active lurking, but not posting enough to do so, which reminds me very much of a dead squirrel trying to convince a dog he's actually a flea.  I don't like dead squirrels and I don't like dead squirrels that try to pose as fleas.<br>...Man that explanation got off track quickly.  Other than the fact that I don't think he's *trying* to appear like he's active lurking, hopefully it's clear enough anyway.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Unvote: Om</span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: joelsdaman1</span><br><br>I haven't forgotten about you Om.

That's just kind of how life goes, isn't it?  I truly and sincerely will miss you.  Please don't doubt that.  I hope that some day in the future, we will be reunited.  Please don't doubt that.  Even now, it pains me to know that such a reuniting is all I have to look forward to in our future and I really wish it not be bittersweet if and when it should come.  Thank you for the good times and great memories.  I can think of no one I would rather have shared them with and, given the chance to do it over, I would choose to share them with you again.

But at the same time, he did vote for Trollie in the post containing the first quote, so it still seems plausible. More plausible to me than Trollie changing his tactic of how he approaches scumhunting. It just seems that if he was really someone who walls to scumhunt, he would have continued. Even if he ran out of time and that's why he stopped, he never mentioned that and he never went back to walling/analyzing each detail like he did before when he did get more time. The only way that makes sense to me is if his goal is not to scumhunt but to give the appearance of it.<br><br>I would prefer to lynch Trollie today. But if we can't get a consensus on him, I would consider Joel, Kthx, and Ztife. Probably Ztife first before the other two.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Ztife</span> hasn't gotten much scrutiny yet (he hasn't posted much), but what he does have is pretty bad. <br>1. He comes in having only skimmed, votes Om, complains about no votes though there were. <br>2. Posting after he's reviewed the game more, he keeps his vote on Om though the <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4698208#p4698208\" class=\"postlink\">only thing he says</a>about it was \"My vote on OM earlier was based on quick skimming, and I admit its pretty bad.\" <br>3. In that same post he calls Joel a null-to-scum read but doesn't vote Joel (and he didn't provide any further comment on Om that would make sense that he would keep his vote there)<br>4. Ztife posts again after Om informs the mod that he's replacing out, but Ztife still doesn't move his vote from Om even though it's on a now inactive spot.<br><br>In short, Ztife has spent no time scumhunting and appears to be doing the bare minimum to skate by to last the day."}

Slandaar looks townie.<br><br>Problems: Your town read on Nacho, who's predecessor voted and then expected the town to give reasons for her and then lurked to replacement before she ever explained her vote or even why she wanted others to do it for her - Nacho himself has done pretty much nothing but jump onto the terminal Elleran wagon because it was there. I'd like to see more from Nacho before making a more decisive call, but I certainly don't get a town read here.<br>Your claim that my vote back onto Elleran was forced is simply wrong. Also, rich coming form the scummiest vote on that wagon.<br>Which leads back to you: Your analysis relies, in large part, on people believing you're town. Your actions make this hard: Vote hopping (onto Trollie, jennifer, joels and elleran) onto only existing wagons (with the exception of your first joels random vote), never initiating anything. 342's looks like an attempt to set up consecutive lynches - its intriguing how your willing to lynch joels who you repeatedly say you think is town.<br><br>Take out your assumed towniness and your town read on Nacho and your analyses' conclusion has much less validity. I think that GM or nacho may be the play for today, their approaches to the day will shed some light on which one (if not both) it is.<br><br>For now, other things.<br><br>I don't get Jennifer's supposed scumminess. I've reread the thread, and her in iso. I just don't see it. Someone care to explain?<br><br>Om/Psyche - Comes out of argument with Slandaar poorly, that unvote was weird and looks like whipped scum. His replacement, Psyche, has done little more than sheep Kthx (of all the people to sheep, really) and discuss the nights goings on. Scumminess resides here.<br><br>Ztife - Bad vote on Om, acknowledges that its bad. Doesn't take it away. Closest he gets to calling anyone else scummy is to accuse joels of being a fence sitting lurker, which is said from his on comfy lurker seat on the fence. Pot calling the kettle black yes? Yes. Not enough to get a solid read, this worries me and leads to:<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Ztife</span><br><br>Pressure here needs to happen, he can't be allowed to slip through this day."}

It's kind of like symmetry, in that it's exactly the same and probabilistically, it doesn't matter one bit whether we lynch on or off the wagon.  Whoa.  And either way, we could say we were lynching based on the person's position with regards to the wagon.  <span style=\"font-style: italic\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Whoa</span></span><br><br>Even if the above wasn't true, the fact that there was a wagon day 1 does not in any way necessitate lynching someone that was on it.

The idea of a scum deliberately thinking that mentioning a townie's name in association with himself might somehow win townpoints is just silly. As well as the idea that this fits in the category of buddying. Moreover, a study I did on the use of the word \"flailing\" several months ago suggested that scum disproportionately resort to buzzwords like these in order to push mislynches. Your uncomfortable usage of the phrase here (along with \"uncertainty\" disclaimer you finished with) makes me think your post could be an example of this.<br><br>Second thing here. The request to lynch Trollie was not over scumhood, but was a test of the waters of a policy lynch. It was never commital, and Elleran's decision to switch to kthxbye so soon after the request as a shift from tunneling on Trollie for several posts just confirms that. But you obscure the background of the switch with words like \"jump\" and by failing to mention that the 'next post' was an addendum to the previous one.<br><br>And since when is expression of suspicion towards someone for the first time and voting for that person in that same post something that is scummy?"}

I haven't played much in the past 2 years and I don't care to go looking back through old games to see where else I might or might not have done it.

This is going to sound stupid, possibly because it is, but the impression I was getting off of him was that of someone quietly whispering to stray townies about massclaim under the voice of objections - like a clich\u00e9d scene of a single underling secretly staging a rebellion against a Big Brother-esque watching-you kind of Man.  That was what prompted my \"Failure to produce a reason or to drop this may as well be a scum claim.\"  I figured that by that point, a townie would be willing to explain the merits of this plan he so firmly believed in, instead of completely ignoring disagreement and hoping a hypothetical vig would suicide out of nowhere by claiming in response to his demand.  His response was to give a possible benefit of a massclaim that ignored the primary objections that had been publicly raised and to more or less call me scum.  Ergo, vote.<br><br><br><br>Also, happy birthday kthx.

The idea of a scum deliberately thinking that mentioning a townie's name in association with himself might somehow win townpoints is just silly. As well as the idea that this fits in the category of buddying. Moreover, a study I did on the use of the word \"flailing\" several months ago suggested that scum disproportionately resort to buzzwords like these in order to push mislynches. Your uncomfortable usage of the phrase here (along with \"uncertainty\" disclaimer you finished with) makes me think your post could be an example of this.<br><br>Second thing here. The request to lynch Trollie was not over scumhood, but was a test of the waters of a policy lynch. It was never commital, and Elleran's decision to switch to kthxbye so soon after the request as a shift from tunneling on Trollie for several posts just confirms that. But you obscure the background of the switch with words like \"jump\" and by failing to mention that the 'next post' was an addendum to the previous one.<br><br>And since when is expression of suspicion towards someone for the first time and voting for that person in that same post something that is scummy?"}

I've played a lot of games with very many very terrible very stupid players with very many very terrible very stupid ideas.

It was a huge jump; you'd defended him just a couple posts beforehand. But there was a tide, and you saw a chance. Opportunism, not crap, is what attracts me to you. Who is attracted to crap?

Let's see an instant replay:<br><br>You literally can not understand why I would consider your votes on Om or Kthxbye opportunistic but you think my vote on you is opportunistic for not having a case, eh?  <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4694743#p4694743\" class=\"postlink\">Here</a> was your vote on Om.  <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4713985#p4713985\" class=\"postlink\">Here</a> was your vote on Kthxbye.  Each of those posts is literally the first time you'd mentioned the player you were then voting for.  Can't see why I'd think they were opportunistic, huh?<br><br>For the record, not having a \"case\" isn't really what I found your votes opportunistic for.  But that's okay, because you think they're opportunistic for that reason and who am I to argue?"}

If we reveal tomorrow, scum won't be able to accurately predict if they can kill you tonight because they won't know what other roles are out there. Versus if we reveal today, scum will have an accurate reading of what roles are out there and can thus plan the night accordingly. The upside of revealing today doesn't to me outweigh that."}

I read his first post as cryptic because it's not really sure what he was referring too due to lack of content. Though, I have to agree with him that sometimes it's a town-tell to hop around wagons, but other times it's not. I think it's too early right now to call someone town for that.<br>The fact he also says anyone who isn't on the action draws his attention, but he's not really in on the action himself.<br>(Watch Listed)<br><br>I like Jennifer's post 42. <br>I also believe it's a nice hiding spot for scum to just go after lurkers.<br><br>Is it just me, but I do not understand Rondar's vote on Jennifer. I feel as if it's ill placed. I'm not even sure if he has a reason for voting her. He says he does, but doesn't say it outloud. Guessing games suck.<br><br>Slandaar: What kind of useless questions is that? (53)<br><br>Warming up to the fact DRK is scum. Not for sheeping for Rondar, but for being so damn sketchy. Huge gut feel, FoS.<br><br>Really, Kthx. He is town, why?<br><br>DRK's post 84 has given me yet another scum ping. Mainly due to keeping reads close to the chest which could future give a great reason to hop votes. <br><br>Nice, I hate my own slot's post 88. Complaining about pages to read overnight/during the day is really scummy to me. I have recently seen some scum players complain about it. <br><br>Slandaar's OMGUS towards my own slot. Wtf.<br>So what was your purpose of asking GM those questions? What did you get out of it? Seemed like useless filler posts to me.<br><br>Took you so long to answer that until poked. I would have gave my results of a reaction test right away.<br><br>Hmmm. Not sure what to make of the last line of DRK's post 104. <br>I already know my own alignment, but if I was a speculator looking in - I would have been convinced that this post is a telegraphed 'HEY SCUM BUDDY CALM THE HELL DOWN'.<br><br>Okay Jennifer definitely feels town. I don't get the wagon on her. I think it's scum motivated. If I had to pick the scum on the wagon it's DRK.<br><br>Kthx - way to ping the radar. Seriously. You were town last game we played and you were bitching about the lack of content, but now you are doing opposite. (FoS)<br><br>... @ GM's last post. Feels like he's just trying to post something without really trying. It feels forced. <br>(Watch List)<br><br>Jason I have the urge to kick you. /Kicks Jason.<br><br>OHGUISE- Slandaar saw the same thing I did. At first his post reminded me of the same game where he called my Mason Partner scum and then never elaborated, but this time he did.<br><br>Okay Joel's post 183 is opportunistic as hell. (FoS)<br><br>Kthx - I don't like how you came back to post a post that was directed at you. Nice you come when called. <br><br>Q21 feels town. I like how he unvotes when he feels his vote isn't in the right place. He's applying pressure.<br><br>Ztife's post is um, bad. He jumps on one of the biggest wagon's without reading or posting content. (FoS)<br><br>Okay, Slandaar might be town. Saying might because he's applying pressure and he's in my head. <span style=\"font-size: 50%; line-height: 116%;\">(GETOUTOFMYHEADMAN)</span><br>The fact Kthx is trying to put meta on another different player is disturbing. Not two people are the same - don't ever trying to apply one play style to someone totally different.<br><br>I <span style=\"font-style: italic\">kinda</span> like DRK's post 257. I don't get the reason why she would put the damn metaphor into it. It's basically adding nothing. Feels as if she's trying to give too much explanation for a vote that could be explained without going round-round.<br>Let's see if she follows up on the Z-Om exchange in another post.<br><br>Oh, okay that's it. I had enough.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"> Vote: DRK </span><br><br>Z is fencesitting and his post #270 is noncommittal. (FoS)<br><br>If I had two votes. I'd vote you along with DRK.<br><br>What the actual fuck. Kthx - that hammer was HORRID. That is completely scummy as fuck.<br><br>---<br><br>Care to explain your reasons on voting Q21, Kthx and even DRK? I'd ask Pysche, but I'm his current replacement. <br><br>Kthx's. I said it last game and I'll say it again. The hammer you did comes off shady and maybe I don't like lynching without giving time to claim.

We talked a little, but not much, last night. I don't have a scum read on her. My main hesitation at putting her in the town slot is the fact that we're neighbors. I tried reading up on neighbors as much as possible to figure out if it means auto-scum and it doesn't (seems the consensus is that it's only when you have at least 3 in a neighborhood that 1 is likely def scum). <br><br>I'm starting to suspect Psyche/Mala for scum (and weclome, Mala! Thanks for replacing in!) Psyche was definitely charismatic and fun to read, but I think that part of that flair was masking scumminess. There was one part that jumped out at me where people were asking Psyche to re-state his case, and he wouldn't .. which seemed odd. Because even if he didn't want to pull up his old post, he should have able/wanting to simply restate it, at least in a simplified format and he hadn't.<br><br>But before voting as we've come this far, I want to get claims from everyone (waiting on Kwll, DRK, and conf from GM) and then try to piece it together with the roles/people's posts."}

At this point we hope to shit that scum that doesn't have a roleblocker because that would mean we just screwed our power roles over entirely.<br><br>What I was going to say yesterday (IRL yesterday) if I'd actually posted was that, in my 1-2-years-out-of-date-knowledge-of-site-meta, doctor and scum are, in order, the two most common fakeclaims, and also happen to be two powerful roles that don't often get put into minis together (and that, last I checked, people were moving away from putting cops in minis at all).  Then I was going to say that q21's \"Wow, you guys suck at this game, except the scum, they're really good.\" inside his claim post was scummy as fuck.  My memory might just be faulty, but I don't think I've ever seen someone say something like that in a claim post and be town.  That's why I didn't unvote after his claim.<br><br>His day 2 posts don't contain anything I would consider to be in conflict with a night 1 town investigation of Kthx (the thing meowakittens said was in conflict with his claimed investigation was not actually at all in conflict with it), so at the very least, that checks out.<br><br><br>Now that we've basically outed all our roles, here's how things break down balance-wise:<br><br>The old 2goon vs 5 townies + doc + cop semi-open newbie setup was incredibly town-sided.

Basically, scum would know before town what the setup was and still got mauled when that setup came up.  Taking away the semi-open nature of the setup to put it into a closed game probably doesn't change things much.  It might help scum a bit depending on believability of claims.  Adding 1 scum and 3 townies to extend to 13p tilts the game toward scum's favor.  Adding in a tracker, a vig, and neighbors....yeah, that tilts the game crazy amounts into town's favor.  Even with a potential mafia roleblocker/rolecop/whatever, that is a HUGE amount of town power.  Needless to say, assuming we actually have a vig, at least one of the cop and doc is lying (removing tracker from that setup would not be enough to balance the game...removing the doctor might balance the game if scum have a lot of power).  If we don't have a vig, then....I don't really know how balance in a 1-2-10/1-3-9 setup works out.  Do people actually use serial killers in mini normals?

I got caught up in other things and forgot I still needed to talk with her to convince against killing Kthx.

I don't remember which but I'm guessing they were in that order because it just makes more sense that way I think...  I no longer know what [z] and [w] were.  I'm reasonably certain they were someone else's opinions on *something*, with one of the opinions leading to the conclusion that Om/Psyche was scum and one leading to the conclusion that Slandaar was scum.  WAIT NVM I THINK I REMEMBER NOW THAT THEY WERE REFERRING TO NACHO'S VOTES.  [v] was something to the effect of \"repeatedly hit my head against a wall\".  Not really that but the idea is the same.<br><br>Around that point i was deciding to just not care about either Slandaar or Psyche - if Slandaar was actually doctor, he was going to die and hooray woohoo happy day scum nightkills read him for me.  But oh man did I want to strangle myself every time I read a post after that of someone saying they still thought Slandaar was scum.  No, we do not need to give scum a reason not to kill him if he's town.  No no no no no.  No. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\">  Then we massclaimed.  Let's all agree never to massclaim in a mini normal on day 2 again unless under very very special circumstances okay?  I was somewhat needlessly worried about the possibility at that point of a possible scum roleblocker blocking hypothetical Slandaar town doctor to just bypass him entirely and take out the directly threatening roles, but in hindsight that didn't even make sense because blocking the vig would almost definitely be better because it would keep the town stuck on evens and give scum an extra nightkill.  Unless WHO CARES UNLESS WHAT, NOT ME.  BUT YEAH, I spent most of day 2 not passing judgment on Psyche or Slandaar at all because scum would have to sort it out anyway and THEY DID.  Also, the above mess of a blurb of explanation should explain why not Psyche in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4727461#p4727461\" class=\"postlink\">this post</a>.<br><br>TBH by the end of the day I probably should have just bothered to try to read them instead of waiting for night 2 to sort it out but gg no re ribbit ribbit it doesn't matter and scum served itself up on a silver platter by the end of day 2 anyway.  It was delicious and so are my legs, or so I've heard.  I wouldn't eat frog legs because I'm not a cannibal.<br><br><br>Iso me if you want to find why I was voting Om initially but hint: it was because he suddenly took a stance that made no sense when he realized he was on the wrong side of the Berlin Wall.  That's right, Reagan said things and Gorbachev did some demolition and JFK was a jelly doughnut but not really.<br><br>I have like zero clue what Psyche did in this game.  I know he posted some stuff and then made a case and then talked about it a bunch, but he really wasn't a central character anyway.  He was the butler so of course he's supposed to turn out to be a killer but then you find out it was actually the maid and she has <span style=\"font-style: italic\">boobs</span> so who really cares about the butler?  Except that analogy doesn't make sense here because I'm only talking about one person and they are all the butler and they are the killer.<br><br>Then Psyche left and it probably had something to do with peanut butter and Meowakittens joined in and posted <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4740810#p4740810\" class=\"postlink\">this</a> and what in the I don't even she calls her own slot scummy like 3 times...nvm I just counted and it's 2 times and I can't even imagine what kind of thought process would have to go into a town post to produce an output that I'm pretty sure just reads \"well shit, I'm scum\" plus or minus suspecting 5/9 players and attacking any post in which I went off on a tangent.  Not gonna lie, I can be a pretty damn easy target early in the game if I take things too far and I don't think any of Meowmeowkittens' reads changed after like page 5.  INTERESTING.<br><br><br><br>SO YEAH, this is where I would lay down a dramatic vote and announce the L-1 that Ztife just took away, but seriously I think we would be more likely to get a quickhammer out of kwll's slot than a claim if he comes back, and, regardless of what his alignement is, now would be a bueno time to know if we need to massively change our assumptions of the game."}

I don't know too much about balance, but this is what I think.<br>If so, that pretty much takes Ztife and Goodmorning off the suspect list.<br><br>I intended to just townhunt a bit, but by process of elimination Jennifer and MalaKittens have to be my two prime scum suspects. And both are at L-2. That just seems way too easy. I'll do ISO's of both tomorrow.<br><br>What did already catch my eye:<br><br>- Jennifer didn't do much except vote my predecessor for a long period of time. The reasoning for the vote wasn't particularly strong (especially because Kwll flaked), it seemed more like a placeholder vote. It seems odd to me that someone would refrain from doing actual relevant votes when big issues were going on.<br>- MalaKittens commented at some point that she didn't want to do setup discussion. I find this to be bogus. The reason setup discussion is bad for town is because it helps scum find power roles. But after a massclaim that's irrelevant so setup discussion can only help town. This might have already been said though (seems obvious enough) but I didn't see it.<br>At the start of Day 2 Psyche commented that 'scum wouldn't kill TheTrollie'. I don't know what to make of that, it seems really awkward.<br><br>That's what I got so far. I could put a vote for either Jen or Mala at this point but I'm not going to vote based on process of elimination, let alone L-1. More content coming tomorrow when I've done some proper ISO's."}

I stand on Jenn and Kwll (Yolo) being the highest contenders for being scum.<br>I was thinking you were probably scum, but after looking at interactions - there's a strong chance you are town based on the timing of the Q21 vote. The only time that he moved you from a scum read to a town read was based on massclaim discussion. <br><br>Basically my reads are as follows:<br><br>Possible Town: (highest to lowest)<br><br>GM - Q21 was determined to get him lynched. There's a chance this was to possibly bus or distance, but I don't think that's the case. I also have to put into consideration that he is a vig and not a SK. <br><br>Z - Tracker Claim.<br><br>DRK - Lots of interactions between you and Q21. To me doesn't look at all forced. Had an early vote on you during Day 1. Only time he switched the read on you was during Day 2 when the massclaim discussion came up.<br><br>Nacho - Weakest. Nacho could have led the charge on Q21 knowing that there was a chance that Q21 was going down anyways. Only problem was the switch between the lists. I have found recently when scum is on the chopping block that they will put their partner's name up on the scum list in order to distance and have their other partner on a null or town read.<br>(I'm very aware that Q21 did the same for me, but knowing I'm town via Role-PM. My PoE has lead me to probably Nacho being scum. Which is why he's the lowest of town reads) Meaning I wouldn't vote Nacho now, but if it comes down to a 1 living scum player in a LyLo - I'd vote Nacho<br><br>Scum:<br><br>Kwll (YoLo) - More the lack of posts between Q21. The interactions they did have looked like distancing. <br>Jenn - I felt that Q21 was trying to test the waters on the possibility of a Jenn lynch. I feel he was looking for reasons that could be used to jump onto a Jenn bandwagon in the future if she ever got into danger.<br><br>I haven't read up on the possibility of the neighbor role being M/T - T/T<br><br>I also see it highly unlikely that Jenn and Kwll are scum together. I think only one is scum and the other is probably town. Therefore PoE leads me to say that I have someone in the town list that's probably scum, but I haven't figured out which. <br><br>They were basically both pairing and reads."}

Very few people actually walk away from mafia when they say they're going to.<br><br><br>I still suspect this setup was just bad for town.  When I thought the setup was tracker+doc+vig-townie neighbor pair vs 3 goons, I thought the game was somewhat town-sided, but not unbearably so.  But with an SK in place of the vig...<br><br>Neighbor is a fun role that I usually really like.  People enjoy talking at night (well, most people do), so it's fun to play as, and how useful of a role it is for town depends on how well the town neighbor(s) manage(s) to use it (as opposed to a role like cop, where you investigate someone and get useful information no matter what).  But a town neighbor tied to an SK is a bit iffy.  An SK-neighbor is potentially at a pretty decent disadvantage.  SK is already a very difficult role to win with (especially with no immunities) and probably shouldn't be part of a neighborhood.  From the town side of things, having a town neighbor tied to an SK neighbor is less valuable than having a town neighbor tied to a mafia neighbor or having a pair of town neighbors.  An SK is certainly a scum faction, but overall less dangerous and worrisome than a mafia team (for most of the game, at least).<br><br>Having that neighbor + tracker + doctor vs 3 goons and an SK definitely seems weak to me.  Town mislynched day 1, followed by 3 straight mafia lynches.  It's pretty rough for that to not be good enough for a town win in a mini.  The fact that the game did end up being so close was largely because of the inherently self-balancing nature of having multiple scum factions - the better one faction does, the more the other factions target it.  Town was doing well, so goodmorning took out townies to improve her odds.  The game shouldn't have been close in terms of strictly mafia vs town.  Town should have been steamrolling the mafia, but the SK just hurt the town too much.  It's partly just the nature of SKs in minis, but it's also partly town not having enough power here to deal with the number of threats they had to get rid of.<br><br>Just to make sure I'm not getting the wrong point across, I'm not taking anything away from goodmorning here.  Winning as no-immunity SK-neighbor in a mini normal is not at all an easy feat and she deserved her win.  I'm just not sure town had a fair chance overall in this game.<br><br>Other than that though, the modding was overall smooth.  Generally frequent and accurate votecounts, prods and replacements handled promptly, flavor was good when I was unlazy enough to read it (I'm really really lazy about reading flavor, sorry &gt;.&gt;).  I still think the kwll situation was handled poorly, but it didn't end up impacting the game, so no harm done.<br><br><br>@Meowmeow/q21<br>It was fun being scummy scums with you and I would scumscum the scum with you two again~  Sorry for my lame buses on the two of you and hopefully you're not mad that I kind of gave up on the last day.  I wouldn't have done that if I felt I had any chance there.  One day we should group up to form the Scum4u company and use it to organize murders while pretending to give out free hugs.  And we can also give out free hugs.  Hugs are good~"}
