Votes must be <span class=\"noboldsig\">bolded</span> or in <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: tags</span>, preferably on a new line. If I miss a vote, let me know in the thread so I can correct it. Do not bold the word \"vote\" unless you actually intend to vote.<br>2. Once a majority of votes is reached, that person is lynched. If a majority isn't reached by the deadline, a no lynch will occur.<br>3. Days are about 3 weeks long, though I reserve the right to shorten this if necessary.<br>4. Nights are between 48 and 72 hours long. Any action not submitted within 72 hours will not happen. (For compulsive actions, a random target will be selected) If a night starts on a weekend, it will always end on a weekday.<br>5. Do not talk about this game outside the thread unless your role allows you to. (This is a site rule anyway, punishable by modkill)<br>6. When you die, you can make one \"BAH!\" post, which must not contain any game-specific information. After that, you must be silent as the grave. (pun intended)<br>7. Do not edit posts.<br>8. Do not quote communication from the mod. Paraphrasing is acceptable.<br>9. If you are going to be gone for an extended period of time, please let me know or request replacement. I will respect short V/LA and not prod you during that time.<br>10. If you don't post for 72 hours, you will be prodded and must post within 48 hours or be replaced. <span class=\"noboldsig\">Instead of a third or later prod, you will be immediately placed at the top of the replacement queue- in other words, you will be the highest priority for replacement.</span> You have been warned.<br>11. If nobody posts in the thread for 24 hours or more, a massprod will be issued. If it happens twice in the same game day, the day will end immediately.<br>12. If you are to be replaced, you have a grace period up to when your replacement volunteers.<br>13. I will only modkill if the integrity of the game is damaged. If you get modkilled, there is a good chance you will be blacklisted as well.<br>14. If you need to get my attention, write something like \"<span class=\"noboldsig\">MOD: you missed a vote.</span>\" It mainly just needs to stick out.<br>15. <span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #FF8000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Orange</span></span></span> is my color. Don't impersonate me.<br>16. Night actions are determined using Natural Action Resolution.<br>17. I reserve the right to modify these rules as necessary. I will give you fair warning when this happens.<br>18. Don't lose your role PM. <span class=\"noboldsig\">I will not resend it under most circumstances.</span><br>19. I just lost The Game.<br></ul>"}

If scum want to claim a town-read on town, fine by me. That's just one less town they will be able to lynch come end of day. In fact if scum want to claim a town-read on <span style=\"font-style: italic\">scum</span>, great! Just makes it that much easier to catch their buddy when they die.</div></blockquote><br><br>Well let me say it another way. I questioned iam's town read on cworl because it seemed like a questionable reason to call cworl town. Scum don't need to find legit town reads, because they know town from scum (not 3rd parties or other scum but you know what I mean). Calling another player town for a bad reason looks like fake scumhunting (er, townhunting? POE scumhunting?) in an attempt to look like a townie.<br><br>I disagree that town reads shouldn't be questioned if the reason for the town read is bad. Townies shouldn't be riding other players off as town so easily for weak reasons. Bad town reads should be questioned to the same extent as bad scum reads.<br><br>Given your examples:<br>scum claims bad town-read on town: I see town and scum reverse town reads all the time. They're certainly not locked out of not voting the townie at the end of the day, and it isn't a scum tell to do so because townies do it all the time too.<br><br>scum claims bad town-read on scum: \"great! Just makes it that much easier to catch their buddy when they die.\" - given this is your thought, wouldn't it be plausible that clever scum claim town reads on townies to set up false scum partner links in the event the scum dies? Don't say it never happens because I once got lynched as a townie due to a similar false connection to a dead scum.<br><br>also:<br><br>town claims bad town-read on scum: scum potentially gets a free ride if the town doesn't question the bad town read.<br><br>to be thorough...<br><br>town claims bad town-read on town: a bad read is a bad read even if it happens to be correct. It deserves to be questioned just like a bad scum read even if it happens to be correct.<br><br>I don't have any problem with putting someone at L-1. I have a problem with someone placed at L-1 (or any vote really) for a bad reason. So back to your original vote, what makes kuz's objection to the town-read vote worthy, but my objection not?<br><br>Last point - automatically claiming at L-1 isn't a mandatory procedure. Kuz wasn't stalling, it was clear he wasn't - well, shouldn't - be getting lynched yet, no one was asking him to claim, and no one was threatening to hammer. If you wanted kuz to claim, why didn't you ask him to?<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>EmpTyger wrote:</cite>C-W:<br>Sorry, not ready to compromise, not while <span class=\"noboldsig\">Rhinox is being this slimy.

But I guess, even if L-1 is ok, neither you or ThAd questioned kuz - something like \"why are you upset IAUA thinks Cworl is town?\" ya know, do some scum hunting? And then ThAd already insinuated that kuz is scummy because he didn't claim at L-1, but notice ThAd never asked him to. It seems like ThAd isn't trying to pressure kuz trying to get a read on him, but more like he's just trying to convince the rest of us to suspect/vote kuz.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>IAUA wrote:</cite>Last sentence is also wrong. It's not sound logic. People discredit these kind of 'townslips' all the time, on the basis that \"scum could fake it\", but have you ever actually seen any scum player do that?

I don't know if I could find you a specific example, but it sounds like something I would try to do, maybe even accidentally - such as, I'd be thinking about trying to confuse the town about the total number of scum or something. Yeah, I'd say its reasonable to assume its something scum would think of doing intentionally or unintentionally.<br><br>But I'm not saying its always null (or if I did, thats not what I meant).

Doesn't make it a scum tell, just less of a town tell and more towards null. Definitely not \"confirmed town\".<br><br>But like I said already, I understand what you're saying, I just disagree.

Calling another player town for a bad reason looks like fake scumhunting (er, townhunting? POE scumhunting?) in an attempt to look like a townie.</div></blockquote><br>You're probably right that this does happen, but I'm not sure how much scum do this. Do you think Iam was doing it in this case?<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Rhinox wrote:</cite>I disagree that town reads shouldn't be questioned if the reason for the town read is bad.

Just makes it that much easier to catch their buddy when they die.\" - given this is your thought, wouldn't it be plausible that clever scum claim town reads on townies to set up false scum partner links in the event the scum dies?

If you're convincing others to vote who you think is scum, you have to already think the player is scum, and thus already have a read. IMO, it seemed like you skipped the figuring out stage and jumped right into the convincing others to lynch him stage.

I did go through the figuring out stage, although it may not have been obvious.

First off; my take on the whole \"town read\" argument. Everything should be questioned, the more useful information we have to work with, the better. Than said, the speculation on the various scenarios put forth by Rhinox and ThAdmiral (#109) is just a list of variables. We all know there are many variables and possibilities. Listing all the ways scum/town might claim town reads on other scum/town is needless unless each possibility is backed up by an <span style=\"font-style: italic\">in game</span> example. There's no point in listing possibilities for which the conditions have not been met.<br><br>Speaking of many possibilities:<br><blockquote><div><cite>Mitsuru Kirijo wrote:</cite>Also, I don't want to hammer nor am I afraid to hammer. If I was scummy in wanting to hammer but being afraid to hammer, I'd be hammering town, would I not? As such, I would be encouraging this wagon, rather than discouraging it. I don't understand the reasoning behind your vote.</div></blockquote><br>That's a <span style=\"font-style: italic\">whole </span>lot of WIFOM. What did you hope to accomplish by giving such a convoluted response?<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>EmpTyger wrote:</cite>To me, the jump onto kuz feels like simple opportunism.</div></blockquote><br>Kind of like your #55, a blatant attempt to start a wagon... for coming in a bit late?<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Fishythefish wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>EmpTyger wrote:</cite>kuz:<br><blockquote><div><cite>th3kuzinator wrote:</cite>Why you both are assuming malicious intent behind the question is beyond me.</div></blockquote><br>Well, why *shouldn't* they assume malicious intent?  This is a game of mafia, after all.<br>And why should \"it's my playstyle\" give you carte blanche to do whatever-you-want?</div></blockquote><br>I don't like this much, particularly in the context of kuz being under attack. The first sentence is just nonsense - of course everyone should assume the <span style=\"font-style: italic\">possibility</span> of malicious intent, but assuming malicious intent to make your case is arguing from your conclusions.</div></blockquote><br>I agree with this. The whole arguing from conclusions thing also applies to Rhinox and ThAdmiral's list of possibilities I mentioned above, i.e. listing some town read scenarios and then using those to make your point.<br><br>Between the contrived listing of possibilities, arguing about town reads, and speculating about why kuz left, I don't feel like there's enough at this point to make my vote.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>C-Worl wrote:</cite>Hey Archaist who <strike>is</strike> are your partner(s)?</div></blockquote> Fixed.

While we've seen people's opinions on individual players so far, we've seen nothing of your opinions on who is scum. If you don't have reads on certain people, at least give us your scumtells.</div></blockquote><br>Sure, thanks for asking politely. Here are my reads on every player:<br><br>1. Mitsuru Kirijo: A fairly infrequent poster whose lurking made me somewhat suspicious. However, his first major post #68 seems to be doing some genuine scum hunting. Warning against quicklynches and wanting more time to discuss seems pro-town to me (#78,147). #112 also agrees with my opinion that town reads can be questioned. There seems to be some kind of taboo against questioning reads, I've run into this more than once, and I don't like it. Leaning Town.<br><br>2.sAbLLimINal: His very first post he mentions town power roles, suspicious, but nothing major. One of his points I agree with is in his #44:<br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>all C-Worl is trying to do is appeal to emotion</div></blockquote><br>More on that later. He also brings up a good points in his most recent #164. The reasonless vote switching is scummy indeed. Leaning Town.<br><br>3. EmpTyger: #49 <blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div> iama: I want to hear more about this town read too. 1 day later, C-W/Kuz still feels just as contrived.</div></blockquote>Not the only player questioning that read, yet iama completely ignores this question, and somehow Kuz is the only one to take any heat from questioning the town read. Very suspicious.<br><blockquote><div><cite>EmpTyger wrote:</cite>There are legitimate reasons to oppose a townread, although I don't think they apply in this instance.</div></blockquote>When he questioned the town read himself, he then jumps on the bandwagon against Kuz for doing so. Opportunistic is an understatement, but he moves on to Rhinox without anyone calling him out on it, so that makes it seem less scummy to me. Leaning Neutral.<br><br>4. th3kuzinator: Over-defensive, over-eager, then left. I think he was frustrated, being new to this site, that everyone was jumping on him in his very first game here. Yes, his initial questions would have been better asked elsewhere, but accusing him of \"trying to figure out the status quo\" (C-Worl #28) is a reach, and it's understandable why someone would get frustrated from such an accusation. Also, not the only person to question iama's read, yet took all the heat for it... yeah, I would be frustrated too. Town.<br><br>5. ThAdmiral: Random vote #38, despite the fact that a good amount of actual stuff happened before then. It's his way of \"checking in?\" (#51), if he's serious that's not a very good reason. Proceeds to go after Kuz for a long time, only to OMGUS C-Worl, then switch back to Kuz/me as soon as iamausername says so. Opportunistic wagon jumping if I ever saw it. While vote hopping in itself isn't necessarily scummy, ThAdmiral seems to just be for whatever wagon seems most likely to lead to a quick lynch. Leaning Scum.<br><br>6. C-Worl: <blockquote><div><cite>sAbLLimINal wrote:</cite>all C-Worl is trying to do is appeal to emotion</div></blockquote>And push quicklynches by doing so, as I've already pointed out. Most recently refusing to give me a single quote to back up his statements, instead opting to say \"you didn't read.\" You would think that presenting evidence would be to his benefit, especially since he was accusing me of not presenting enough. Instead just a \"no, I'm done talking to you,\" emotional much? The most impatient player in this game. Impatient for lynching, impatient in answering questions, and vote switching when iamausername says so. Leaning Scum.<br><br>7. iamausername: Had a town read on C-Worl for <span style=\"font-style: italic\">one line</span> (#39). Didn't answer EmpTyger's request for clarification but voted Kuz for challenging it (easier wagon?). <blockquote><div><cite>iamausername wrote:</cite>no one has indicated a willingness to drop the hammer vote, as far as I remember. I mean, I'd prefer it if someone did, because he's scum, but until that happens, he shouldn't claim.</div></blockquote>How are you so certain he's scum? <blockquote><div><cite>iamausername wrote:</cite>C-Worl is town, ThAd is town</div></blockquote>This brings me to my other point, that I've mentioned before; iamausername seems too sure of himself when he names people town or scum. What makes you think ThAdmiral is town after all the wagon hopping he's done? Leaning Scum.<br><br>8. Fishythefish: Goes after sAbLLimINal for mentioning town power role, justified in my opinion. He notices the wagon on Kuz has serious flaws (#74) and makes a good point in his #115 <blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Well, he only called his whole wagon scummy after arguing with every individual player on it.</div></blockquote> Not the biggest poster, and doesn't make very controversial statements or accusations. Maybe a cautious player, maybe a bit of lurking in plain sight. Not too sure about him. Leaning Neutral.<br><br>9. Rhinox: Comes in a bit late, but soon posts a real post, so not a big deal in my opinion. <blockquote><div><cite>Rhinox wrote:</cite>kuz asking about gambits and LAL seems like it could be newbscum trying to figure out how much he can get away with</div></blockquote>I disagree with this, just as with C-Worl's #28, asking about the game and trying to feel out other players isn't a scum tell, everyone should be trying to get a feel for other players, and asking about the game is an easy way to start the conversation, especially for someone new to the site. <blockquote><div><cite>Rhinox wrote:</cite>early in the game, when I'm still trying to get started on figuring out player's alignments, I tend to ask questions rather than just coming out and making a point</div></blockquote>Which is exactly what Kuz was doing! A bit hypocritical here. Rhinox redeems himself a bit by questioning ThAdmiral's quick L-1 vote on Kuz, and also this: <blockquote><div><cite>Rhinox wrote:</cite>I questioned iam's town read on cworl because it seemed like a questionable reason to call cworl town.</div></blockquote> So now EmpTyger, Rhinox, Kuz, and myself have questioned that read, yet iamausername has not clarified and only Kuz/me gets attacked for it. Rhinox is suspect for attacking Kuz for asking questions, when he admits to doing the same, but seems OK otherwise. Leaning Neutral.<br><br>So, there is my read on everyone."}

One was the rather odd line of \"Why shouldn't people assume malicious intent - it's a game of mafia?\" - which is a reason to say that absolutely anything is scummy.

Then you joined the \"not claiming at L-1 is scummy\" chorus, when noone had asked kuz to claim and there was no protown reason for doing so.

Aside from voting ThAd to move the game along, cworl hasn't really done anything I object to. <span style=\"font-style: italic\">Possible</span> the townslip iam pointed out should weigh in a little. archaist/kuz seems like the \"every game typical D1 scummy looking townie mislynch\" to me. kuz got more attention for his playstyle - being a cocky ass - more so than for doing anything really scummy. archaist I'm null on right now. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>emp wrote:</cite>Rhinox:<br>It's not the what of the micro, it's the how of the macro.<br>When you placed your vote on kuz, what were you hoping would happen?

I guess you could call it a pressure vote. He was scummy enough for my first real vote of the game, but then his response to my reasons seemed like a townish response, and then I saw ThAd vote him for a reason I didn't agree with at all. So you're exactly right, it is the how and not the what. I wasn't upset about kuz being at L-1 (the what), I was upset about \"how\" ThAd tried to justify that vote. It looked opportunistic I guess. I'd have had the same response if it wasn't an L-1 vote. A bad (IMO) vote is a bad vote, regardless of where it comes in the VC. <br><br>And like I've been trying to say, just because I was voting kuz for some reasons doesn't mean I'm locked into that vote for the day or that I should be happy if anyone else votes kuz for any reason. You're trying to say that I got upset at ThAd for voting my suspect, but that is a misrepresentation. I got upset with ThAd because he placed a vote for a weak reason IMO."}

I don't believe I said you and Rhinox are equal in any way, other that my read on you is both neutral. Just because no one else was voting Rhinox doesn't mean it's not opportunistic to jump on him for coming in late. And yes, I agree with you, I did say what Rhinox did was suspicious in that post, though neither of you two seemed strongly one way or the other."}

Compare that to how kuz has acted elsewhere in the game.  Kuz had absolutely no problem responding to C-Worl's initial accusation.  He's talking about LAL and chainsawing.  He is not a newbie.  Let me repeat that: <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Kuz is not a newbie.

In all of these you seem to have totally made up you mind about the reasons for kuz's behaviour - when you ask him questions, they are leading enough to be functionally rhetorical. I feel these aren't \"questioning kuz to work out his alignment\", they are \"pushing for kuz's lynch\" - and that the points in them are really pretty weak."}

In this scenario Rhinoxscum is 8 hours from deadline, wagons split 3-3 scum-town, he's on the town wagon. It's <span style=\"font-style: italic\">perfect</span> for a no lynch, and there's no more onus on Rhinox than anyone else to switch votes. To get a no lynch, you don't bus there.<br><br>So. I see that as a bad move - that close to deadline, the risk of a NL outweighs the possible confirmation points - but not so bad as to be unrealistic, and the scum motivation for it is weak to non-existent. Rhinox's end of day play still gives me a solid town read on him.<br><br>ThAd on kuz doesn't look like bussing to me. He puts him to L-1 early in the game, a very dodgy move for a scumbag.

If it was some alternate reality where he wasn't scum and would have reacted in an obv-town way (such as a bah go town type of post), then it could have spared a mislynch and the lynch could have shifted to someone more likely to be scum. Alternatively, he could have given a \"bah go scum\" type of post and then he gets hammered for realz for claiming scum. Thats the intent of fake-hammer gambits. I already knew there wasn't a high liklihood of it actually acomplishing anything what with the VC a couple posts back, but I didn't think it would hurt anything either. I didn't think about the possible ramifications about it being so close to deadline.<br><br>It very well might be that fake-hammering arch at the time wasn't the smartest thing to do, but I don't see how your statement: \"Rhinox set up a scenario that could no way help the town.\" - is at all justified by the \"claiming a PR\" example you've given, let alone justified at all. Fake-hammer gambits DO infact help the town and I don't think I've ever seen someone argue that its an anti-town gambit in general, although I certainly see now the possible bad outcomes that could have happened with it being in the context of less than a day to deadline. But just because something bad COULD have happened, doesn't mean I did the fake hammer thing with the INTENT of causing bad things to happen. It just wasn't the smartest play to make.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>emp wrote:</cite>Fishy:<br>You're ignoring an important piece of context:<br>Rhinoxscum is 8 hours from deadline, wagons split 3-3 scum-town, he's on the town wagon, and iama *just* caught his comafia in a \"catch of the game\"-level contradiction.<br><br>*That*'s the full context for Rhinox's fakehammer voteswitch.</div></blockquote><br>You're still not making any sense. If that was the case, if I'm scum I've got 2 options. Bus like hell and hope for town cred, or ignore that iaun said anything and hope he doesn't get hammered, without posting anything for the last 12hrs to deadline. If it was really the \"catch of the game\" (and it kinda was a good catch), and I'm arch's scum partner, what do you think I was really trying to acomplish by fake hammering? What was my scum motivation for doing it?"}

It was a protown post.<br>b) The people on neither of the L-2 wagons - namely Arch, Emp and Rhinox. I have just realised that in my head Rhinox was on the MK wagon before his switch, but actually he was on a non-wagon, which changes things a little - he'd have caught some flak if there had been a no lynch. More so because he should know better than to cause a no lynch by being on a non-wagon. This weakens my conviction that Rhinox is town. Still, he'd recently been on the ThAd wagon, and could easily have returned, so overall the move has to count in his favour."}

Once again for obvious reasons it is dangerous to fakehammer near the deadline because if you do happen to trick people it can cause a nolynch.

Thats just an unjustified theory there's really nothing for me to say about it. I see you trying to manipulate me into a corner. First, iam's catch is so good that voting arch is my only play, but then you also argue I was trying to cause a nolynch. None of it makes sense because if I were scum, there was a better play to cause a nolynch (leave my vote where it was, or vote ThAd for a mislynch &gt; no lynch), and there was a better play to bus (just vote to L-1, no fake hammer).

He could have claimed a PR if instead of fake hammering, I just announced he was at L-1. He could have claimed a PR if someone else put him to L-1.

But if I would have voted and said *L-1* he still could have claimed a PR the same way. So what I'm getting at is trying to figure out why you're trying to make my fake hammer seem more evil than it really is. If I'm arch's scum partner and wanted to set him up to make a PR claim, I didn't have to fake hammer, all I had to do was put him at L-1. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>sAb wrote:</cite>I get what you tried to do about trying to get the \"bah go town\" kind of post.

Are you comparing this to me not voting at all, or me straight up voting him to L-1 rather than fake hammering?

Even if that is the best point in the game, its not a L-1 worthy point.</div></blockquote><br><br>and figuring that the wagon would dissolve pretty quickly. Having done this, he locked himself into sticking with that vote when the wagon actually didn't dissolve. Though he certainly tried to get away when <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3043945#p3043945\" class=\"postlink\">C-Worl presented an opportunity</a>.<br><br>There's also the fact that Archaist seemed to be angling for a No Lynch when he could easily have achieved a ThAd lynch. I don't see that \"Archaist is scum\" is a reasonable explanation for that behaviour in and of itself; I don't think he had the experience to realise that No Lynch is actually a better result for scum than a town lynch, because that's not very intuitive.<br><br>There's also ThAd's horrible, horrible reaction when I voted him today. First he <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3098717#p3098717\" class=\"postlink\">made a really clumsy attempt at accusing me of a scum-slip for knowing scum shot C-Worl</a>, then suggested that me going back on my town read after Fishy's claim was a scummy contradiction, when I'd called everyone but Fishy town in that post, thus requiring that I changed my mind about one of them. <br><br>That fits as scum behaviour for me a lot more than any of Emp, Rhinox or sAb.<br><div align=\"center\"><hr style=\"height:14px; width:90%\"></div><br><blockquote><div><cite>EmpTyger wrote:</cite>iama:<br>Then persuade Fishy to vigkill a different target.

I don't care.  I just want there to be as few ways for Rhinox to slink away tomorrow, despite Fishy doing everything he can to keep Rhinox's options open.  I can't get through to him and I don't know what else I can try.</div></blockquote><br><br>I'm trying to persuade him to shoot someone else. Pointing out why shooting you is a bad idea IS persuading him to shoot someone else. I'm not going to try to persuade him to shoot Rhinox, because I think he's right about Rhinox. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Rhinox wrote:</cite>or c) he's scum, trying to appear to be a) or b) so as to persuade fishy to not shoot him per your reasoning<br>or d) he's a scum RB and knows fishy is getting blocked no matter who he tries to shoot<br>or etc.<br></div></blockquote><br><br>d) was already covered in b). It renders Fishy's choice utterly irrelevant, so we might as well ignore it.<br>c) is pointless fearmongering of the exact same brand that said C-Worl could have been scum feigning ignorance on D1. scumTyger does not dare Fishy to shoot him in an attempted double bluff, particularly not when Fishy hadn't given any particular indication that he had any intention of shooting EmpTyger before he started doing this.<br><br>ScumTyger also doesn't get this gung-ho about killing Rhinox and only Rhinox, but that's neither here nor there.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Fishythefish wrote:</cite>2 days until deadline.

I did not vote ThAd for agreeing with any case I was making. In between my posts, kuz's posting made me not suspect him as strongly, and ThAd looked like he could be opportunistically pushing an easy mislynch, so I unvoted kuz and voted ThAd. Emp's argument basically boils down to that because I voted kuz at one point, that I should be locked into thinking kuz was scum, and that I shouldn't suspect anyone else who votes kuz. That's completely rediculous.<br><br>We went back and forth a little bit, and then emp unvoted me for no explained reason.

It won't happen tomorrow. If there weren't less than 36 hours left and 0 current voters, it wouldn't have happened today. As it is:<br>Vote: C-Worl</div></blockquote><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic\">There are 2 misreps here. Firstly, I didn't propost that emp was mafia. I commented on what C-worl said about emp being mafia with MK, and actually at the end of that commentary that implied that I didn't think emp/MK very likely due to emp unvoting after I made MK the leading wagon. The second misrep is emp saying \"rhinox is arguing that mafia would be doing the same thing he is doing\" - which wasn't the case at all, and I've tried to explain it, but to briefly go through it again:<br><br>-cworl says emp/MK are scum<br>-emp is voting mk<br>-MK reacts poorly as if Cworl struck a nerve, so I vote MK<br>-emp unovtes<br>-I comment that emp's unvote doesn't make sense if he's really scum with MK because if MK would flip scum, emp would look suspicious for unvoting immediately after MK became the leading wagon.<br>-Emp misreps me by (1) saying I'm arguing that he's scum, and (2) saying that I said scum would be voting MK and I'm voting MK so I'm the one who's scum.<br><br>By the way, emp has been accusing me of omgus, but as of this post, emp think cworl and I are attacking him, and he ends up voting cworl (rather than kuz, the guy he was pushing as scum all day while he was voting elsewhere), and spouting out some rhetoric about how he won't let up on me tomorrow. So, he suspects the 2 people he thinks were attacking him (even though I wasn't even attacking him at that point). I don't even think thats OMGUS by the way - emp was clearly trying to argue that me and cworl were scum because in his opinion we were making bad arguments, which by the way is exactly the reason I suspect emp today.<br><br>Moving on to day 2:<br><br>In his first post of the day, he immediately votes me, and reaffirms a couple of the misreps he already used in D1 (namely, that I only unvoted kuz because he was getting votes, and that I'm scum because I was still voting MK after saying if emp was scum with MK I wouldn't have expected him to unvote after MK became the leading wagon [and I still don't understand how emp is making any sense with that last one, and no matter how many times I had asked for clarification, all he ever did was reiterate that I was scum because my vote was on MK - my vote had nothing to do with me speculating that if emp was scum with MK, removing his vote after MK became the leading wagon would look suspicious if MK ever flipped scum. After MK flipped town, it would have been the end of it, except MK kept insisting that I was being hypicritical scum basically])<br><br>This is not a misrep, but its a bad argument:</span><br><blockquote><div><cite>emp 24 wrote:</cite>Whereas with Rhinox, as just pointed out: he hopped onto both the ThAd and the MK counterwagons.  He only voted Archaist hours before deadline, only after your catch all but nailed Archaist's coffin.</div></blockquote><span style=\"font-style: italic\">Given as a reason for why I am scum, but emp was on the Rhinox, and MK, AND cworl counterwagons, and never getting back on the kuz/arch wagon at the end of the day despite calling kuz/arch scum all day from off the wagon.<br><br>This is another bad argument:</span><br><blockquote><div><cite>emp wrote:</cite>Rhinox:<br>You found a 3rd choice: Make it seem like you wanted Archaist to die while actually effecting a no-lynch. Best case C-Worl's attacks against me and MK carry. Worst case Archaist dies anyhow the next day buy there's one less lynch for the town.</div></blockquote><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic\">this is a bad argument because I as scum don't gain anything from this course of action. Suppose I was scum trying to cause a no-lynch, if the no-lynch fails and arch gets lynched, then I would know I would be suspected for trying to cause a no-lynch when scum was about to be lynched, and if somehow my alleged plan to cause a no-lynch succeeded, then arch would probably be lynched the next day anyways (if not me), and then I would definitely be under high suspicion for causing a no-lynch rather than a scum lynch once arch flipped. 3 better things for me to do if I'm scum: 1) do nothing and hope a no-lynch just happens, 2) vote ThAd and cause a mislynch instead, or 3) just outright bus without the games that don't help me if I'm scum.<br><br>This is getting long so I'll just skip to the last misrep, where emp said I'm scum for allegedly expanding my suspect list to include everyone. I think we've said enough about that recently.</span><br><br><br>Basically, emp hasn't made a single valid point against me, but I'll repeat that its not the bad points that are the problem - sometimes townies make bad points - its that he isn't trying to unbiasly determine whether his points are valid, he's just declaring them to be valid and hasn't had to back them up because everyone else either thinks he's town or I'm scum, so he's been getting a pass. Up until now, I'd have probably been willing to except if emp admitted he had confirmation bias and attempted to legitimately reexamine his reads - aside from emp's bad cases and misreps against me, I've been more suspicious of ThAd."}

His response at the time was:<blockquote><div><cite>EmpTyger wrote:</cite>Yes, I messed up by backing off of Archaist in [213].  I concede that this was suspicious and I deserve some scrutiny for it.  But *not* for the reason you listed.  Certainly not when I spent most of yesterday being accused of pushing the kuz/Archaist bandwagon.  Now you're accusing me of being kuz/Archaist's partner for trying to push his mislynch, yet in a way that wouldn't earn me towncred...?</div></blockquote><br>which, while reasonable, doesn't let him off the hook as in a game with only 9 players he may have been trying to avoid wagoning his partner as much as possible while there were other viable targets available (and I said as much at the time).<br>However as bad as his behavior was, it doesn't mean your behavior <span style=\"font-style: italic\">wasn't</span> suspicious and therefore his attack isn't completely invalidated.<br><br>Bottom line: the thing I can't get passed when theorizing about emp as scum is his defense of sab day 2. I can't really see the angle as scum unless he knew sab was going to end up as a mislynch and he could get towncred for it, but a) there was no way he could have known that and b) I don't believe that anyway.<br><br>And emp does bring up a good point about you not writing off certain players as town and focusing on the people you thought were scum. While emp has claimed certain players were def-town who he had no interest in lynching a bunch of times you seem to have kept your options more... open."}

He wears his heart on his sarcastic, arrogant sleeve, and as such is by far easier to read than anyone else in this game has been.

That's cute that you are trying to look pro-town by telling me that I should learn from playing on here long enough. Ill get back to you on that when I finish my first game on here.<br><br>It also amuses me that you are accusing me of fluff considering your 22 is about as devoid of content as it comes. You didn't need to tell me your personal history nor do you need to inform me of the skill level required, but you did anyway. As for the last bit, please continue guessing at the intent behind my posts. You're really making headway.</div></blockquote><br><br>He's sarcastic and dismissive. He assumes himself to be above C-Worl, and does not consider his vote to be a threat. This is useful as a control group for his reactions to townies voting for him, as we know C-Worl's alignment, of course.<br><br>Reaction to Rhinox's vote:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>t3hkuzinator wrote:</cite>@Rhinox: Overdefensive? It's called I don't let anyone try to take advantage of me. I am known throughout smashboards for doing town gambits. It's just what I like to do because it makes the game more enjoyable/exciting for me. Since this is my first game on the site, I wanted to hear the site-specific view of it. Why you both are assuming malicious intent behind the question is beyond me. Also, Iama has a town read on Cworl and his phrasing, not me.<br><br>@Iama: Are you honestly clearing CWorl from saying the word scummates instead of scummate? You do realize any half decent scum player could consciously on unconsciously throw that in? What bothers me more is that CWorl actually picked up on where you were going with it before you explained it.</div></blockquote><br><br>There's other key stuff here too, but first, the Rhinox vote. kuz obviously feels a little more threatened here, and his reaction is a little less dismissive, but it still bears a lot of similarities. He addresses Rhinox directly with a self-aggrandizing paragraph, and is highly defensive and confrontational.<br><br>Furthermore, his \"Why you both are assuming malicious intent behind the question is beyond me.\" is telling; he perceives the attacks on him as a united front, not as two separate and distinct events. This suggests that there is no difference in the motivation of the two of them in his mind.<br><br>Then we have his obvious upset at my pinning C-Worl as town for what he percieved to be invalid reasons. He makes no attempt to disguise his emotions here or anywhere else, and that was his downfall on D1, and I hope it will ultimately prove to be the downfall of his partner too.<br><br>Reaction to my vote:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>t3hkuzinator wrote:</cite>Why do people keep assuming I am upset? lol. Apparently any type of aggressive posting is taken as a sign of being butthurt. It's my playstyle, get over it.<br><br>@Rhinox: Or I could have just asked about it in thread, which was much easier.<br><br>@IAAUN: Someone had put effort into thinking about something? Must be a town-tell.</div></blockquote><br><br>Again, sarcastic and dismissive, \"it's my playstyle, get over it\". That basically sums up his response to all three votes so far.<br><br>Reaction to ThAd's vote:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>t3hkuzinator wrote:</cite>@Emp: What? I was asking the question to get a general feel for the site. My playstyle had nothing to do with the question.<br><br>@Admiral and IAAUS: Show me where I was upset. You're blowing my posts way out of proportion.<br><br>The wagon on me is so freaking scummy and agreed with Mitsuru that Admiral's vote was flat out disgusting.</div></blockquote><br><br>followed by flaking entirely from the game and the site. <br><br>Here we see t3hkuzinator throwing his toys out of the pram. There's no dismissive \"it's my playstyle, get over it\" attitude here. Instead we get emotive language like 'so freaking scummy' and 'flat out disgusting'. He's very clearly moved from being mildly irritated to being genuinely upset, and it is my firm belief that the most, maybe even the only likely explanation for this sudden mood swing is that the one person he thought he could rely on had turned on him too.<br><br>More to come..."}

Clearly, if he believes this is a universal truth, then it must be true of his own scumplay, no? Wanna guess how often ThAd calls people town, and how often he calls people scum? The answer may surprise you.<br><br>I mean, given that the key point of my - and therefore also ThAd's - case against kuz was that he was upset that I correctly identified C-Worl as town, you'd assume that somewhere in ThAd's posts, you would find some declaration that C-Worl is town. But you'd be wrong. He talks around the subject for a long stretch by discussing town reads in the abstract, but never actually gives an opinion on C-Worl. That is, until C-Worl made his dumbass vote on ThAd to \"get the game moving\", at which point ThAd immediately starts calling him scum.<br><br>Together, me and Fishy talk him out of that vote and back around to the Archaist (kuz) wagon, but despite agreeing with Fishy's point that C-Worl's behaviour was dumb but not scummy, he <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3057785#p3057785\" class=\"postlink\">continues to suspect C-Worl</a>. This is heavy cognitive dissonance; his case on t3hkuzinator remains centred on the concept that t3hkuzinator displayed upset at C-Worl being identified as town, and yet he also suspects C-Worl? Does not compute.<br><br>In fact, ThAd never calls anyone town throughout D1. One of his final posts on D1 says that he would \"be willing to move [his] vote to sab, mk or c-worl\" at deadline, implying scumreads on the three of them.

Again, I don't care what you are trying to insist now about yourself, without any evidence.  I'm talking about from *Rhinox*'s point-of-view at the time.  From his perspective, there's not a single shred of evidence for him to think there's any chance of you suddenly abandoning a still-viable Archaist lynch to follow him to ThAd.  Not after your attacks against Archaist, not after your [249], not after stating that Archaist's partner by process-of-elimination was either Rhinox or me, not after even just repeating how you had \"declared C-worl and ThAd to be town\".<br><br>And there isn't a shred of evidence for Rhinox to think that Archaist wouldn't be considered a viable lynch without Rhinox's vote.  Archaist is at lynch-2 and there are 4 players (sAb, Fishy, MK, and myself) yet to post after your [249] and C-Worl declaring it the \"catch of the game\".  All it takes is one of us to agree and Archaist is at lynch-1, and there's no reason why any of us would think it an \"obviously flawed argument\".<br><br>[Also, you're tripping up over yourself in your contorted effort to justify this case against ThAd.  You just rebutted your own card 5, because if you were making \"obviously flawed arguments\" while C-Worl was doing the actual browbeating by calling it the \"catch of the game\", that kind of contradicts your point argument that there's no reason to nightkill C-Worl over you.  Honestly, your recent revisionistly historical posts are doing a great job of further undermining card 4.]<br><br>I'd dare you to point to a single piece of evidence to support this fanciful interpretation of Rhinox's gamestate at the end of D1.<br>But after dawdling around while Fishy squandered our extra chances until it was too late to do anything about it D2, you dawdled around until it was too late for discussion D3.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>iamausername wrote:</cite><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: No Lynch</span><br><br>At this point I feel like it may have some benefit.</div></blockquote><br>No, at this point you left us no other option."}

The reason I was so stuck on emp being scum is because his arguments against me were so bad it came across as scum trying to force a lynch by making a convincing case even if it was wrong, just ignore anything said to oppose the case.<br><br>Procedurally, obviously I'm disappointed that I was forced replaced. I think it was the wrong call and aparently others agree with me. I do apologize for the language I used in thread after the decision was announced. Its just disappointing to be told I'm not allowed to finish a game I put a couple months of effort into because of a mod decision that did not appear to be for the betterment of the game or its players neither at the time nor looking back at the outcome."}
