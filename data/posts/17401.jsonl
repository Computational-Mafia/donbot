Votes must be <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">bolded</div> or in <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: tags</span>, preferably on a new line. If I miss a vote, let me know in the thread so I can correct it. Do not bold the word \"vote\" unless you actually intend to vote.<br>\n2. Once a majority of votes is reached, that person is lynched. If a majority isn't reached by the deadline, a no lynch will occur.<br>\n3. Days are about 3 weeks long, though I reserve the right to shorten this if necessary.<br>\n4. Nights are between 48 and 72 hours long. Any action not submitted within 72 hours will not happen. (For compulsive actions, a random target will be selected) If a night starts on a weekend, it will always end on a weekday.<br>\n5. Do not talk about this game outside the thread unless your role allows you to. (This is a site rule anyway, punishable by modkill)<br>\n6. When you die, you can make one \"BAH!\" post, which must not contain any game-specific information. After that, you must be silent as the grave. (pun intended)<br>\n7. Do not edit posts.<br>\n8. Do not quote communication from the mod. Paraphrasing is acceptable.<br>\n9. If you are going to be gone for an extended period of time, please let me know or request replacement. I will respect short V/LA and not prod you during that time.<br>\n10. If you don't post for 72 hours, you will be prodded and must post within 48 hours or be replaced. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Instead of a third or later prod, you will be immediately placed at the top of the replacement queue- in other words, you will be the highest priority for replacement.</div> You have been warned.<br>\n11. If nobody posts in the thread for 24 hours or more, a massprod will be issued. If it happens twice in the same game day, the day will end immediately.<br>\n12. If you are to be replaced, you have a grace period up to when your replacement volunteers.<br>\n13. I will only modkill if the integrity of the game is damaged. If you get modkilled, there is a good chance you will be blacklisted as well.<br>\n14. If you need to get my attention, write something like \"<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">MOD: you missed a vote.</div>\" It mainly just needs to stick out.<br>\n15. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF8000\">Orange</div></div> is my color. Don't impersonate me.<br>\n16. Night actions are determined using Natural Action Resolution.<br>\n17. I reserve the right to modify these rules as necessary.

For me, this is scummy because town have no real reason to do it). I'm not sure which I find scummier, but I am sure which needs my vote more.<br>\n<br>\n@Rhinox re \"testing the waters\": thanks for that explanation.<br>\n<br>\nThAd's last paragraph of the above post is bizarrely wrong. Seems to say you should never call people out for buddying, which seems to me to be a fine way to catch scum. It's an absurd generalisation, and it feels like he's twisted himself in circles trying to justify his point. I also dislike him saying that he put kuz at L-1 for pressure, and then to call it scummy that kuz hasn't claimed - if he thinks claiming is a natural part of putting someone at L-1, then that must have been part of his reason for doing so. And if he really did want a claim at this stage of the game, based on the evidence we have, that is massively scummy.

I questioned iam's town read on cworl because it seemed like a questionable reason to call cworl town. Scum don't need to find legit town reads, because they know town from scum (not 3rd parties or other scum but you know what I mean). Calling another player town for a bad reason looks like fake scumhunting (er, townhunting? POE scumhunting?) in an attempt to look like a townie.<br>\n<br>\nI disagree that town reads shouldn't be questioned if the reason for the town read is bad. Townies shouldn't be riding other players off as town so easily for weak reasons. Bad town reads should be questioned to the same extent as bad scum reads.<br>\n<br>\nGiven your examples:<br>\nscum claims bad town-read on town: I see town and scum reverse town reads all the time. They're certainly not locked out of not voting the townie at the end of the day, and it isn't a scum tell to do so because townies do it all the time too.<br>\n<br>\nscum claims bad town-read on scum: \"great! Just makes it that much easier to catch their buddy when they die.\" - given this is your thought, wouldn't it be plausible that clever scum claim town reads on townies to set up false scum partner links in the event the scum dies? Don't say it never happens because I once got lynched as a townie due to a similar false connection to a dead scum.<br>\n<br>\nalso:<br>\n<br>\ntown claims bad town-read on scum: scum potentially gets a free ride if the town doesn't question the bad town read.<br>\n<br>\nto be thorough...<br>\n<br>\ntown claims bad town-read on town: a bad read is a bad read even if it happens to be correct. It deserves to be questioned just like a bad scum read even if it happens to be correct.<br>\n<br>\nI don't have any problem with putting someone at L-1. I have a problem with someone placed at L-1 (or any vote really) for a bad reason. So back to your original vote, what makes kuz's objection to the town-read vote worthy, but my objection not?<br>\n<br>\nLast point - automatically claiming at L-1 isn't a mandatory procedure.

Definitely not \"confirmed town\".</div></div></blockquote><br>\nAlso:<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>rhinox wrote:</cite>I agree that C-worl seems town but due to his exchange with kuz.</div></blockquote><br>\nI was originally thinking it could be accidental rather than deliberate as scum or town, but I guess thinking about it a little more (I was previously thinking on the basis of not realizing this was a 9p game and failing to realize there would only be 2 scum), that were cworl scum he would have (probably) talked with his scum partner pre-game, and forgetting you only talked to 1 scum partner is a bit unrealistic.<br>\n<br>\nWhat are we arguing about anyways? You made a point, I disagreed with it but saw your point of view. I don't think you're scummy and I don't think cworl is scummy. If you're trying to get me to believe cworl is confirmed town, its not going to happen at this stage of the game. Doesn't mean I'm arguing to lynch him.<br>\n<br>\n----------------------------<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>ThAd wrote:</cite>You're probably right that this does happen, but I'm not sure how much scum do this. Do you think Iam was doing it in this case?</div></blockquote>No, after questioning IAUA, I don't think he was doing that. But I wouldn't have been able to determine that without questioning him.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>ThAd wrote:</cite>But if you're trying to say it doesn't make them look worse/more suspicious at all you are wrong. Sure they can make up a reason for their behaviour flip, and sometimes it might even be a good one, but any given scum would rather not have to go back on one of their reads if given the choice.</div></blockquote>eh I see what your saying, but I think it forces me into a WIFOM loop if I think about it too much. For example, if it was always more suspicious to reverse a read that scum tried to never do it, then it would actually be a town tell to reverse reads because scum would never do it.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>ThAd wrote:</cite>Sure this happens. But occams razor. That is all.</div></blockquote>Yeah, but also scum could call a townie town just because. Or when a townie is about to get lynched for towncred. Or etc.<br>\n<br>\nI guess what I was really getting at between the 4 scenarios is, suppose IAUN gets lynched or vigged or something today/tonight and happens to be scum. Would you think, based on IAUN calling cworl town, that cworl is more likely to be scum, town, or null? What if IAUN is town? Is cworl town/scum/null? What if cworl dies first and flips town. Is IAUN town/scum/null? What if cworl flips scum? Is cworl town/scum/null?<br>\n<br>\nBasically, I'm saying town or scum can point out town tells (or scum tells) on town or scum, and the only way to do that is in fact through questioning players' town reads and scum reads. There is no set rule that if a player calls town on another player, you will no for sure the other's allignment when one of them flips.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>ThAd wrote:</cite>Fishy said he thought kuz was \"scummy\" and emp said \"I'm ready to shift my vote back to you\", so I'm not sure where you are getting the \"no one was threatening to hammer\" from.<br>\nPerhaps I should have asked kuz to claim, but I didn't.</div></blockquote>Fair enough.

Isn't it just semantics though? I mean, 2 different ways of saying the same thing. Emp's argument is that kuz isn't a newb, but if this comment makes kuz scum I would have to believe he is newbscum because experienced scum aren't going to get mad about a townie calling town on another townie (especially in the first 4 pages of the game) let alone show that anger in thread. Whereas, if I thought scum hated townies to have town read on other townies, I'd look first for the more experienced guy going about it discretely (not to implicate myself or anything <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\">).

If you're convincing others to vote who you think is scum, you have to already think the player is scum, and thus already have a read. IMO, it seemed like you skipped the figuring out stage and jumped right into the convincing others to lynch him stage.

If you don't have reads on certain people, at least give us your scumtells.</div></blockquote><br>\nSure, thanks for asking politely. Here are my reads on every player:<br>\n<br>\n1. Mitsuru Kirijo: A fairly infrequent poster whose lurking made me somewhat suspicious. However, his first major post #68 seems to be doing some genuine scum hunting. Warning against quicklynches and wanting more time to discuss seems pro-town to me (#78,147). #112 also agrees with my opinion that town reads can be questioned. There seems to be some kind of taboo against questioning reads, I've run into this more than once, and I don't like it. Leaning Town.<br>\n<br>\n2.sAbLLimINal: His very first post he mentions town power roles, suspicious, but nothing major. One of his points I agree with is in his #44:<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>all C-Worl is trying to do is appeal to emotion</div></blockquote><br>\nMore on that later. He also brings up a good points in his most recent #164. The reasonless vote switching is scummy indeed. Leaning Town.<br>\n<br>\n3. EmpTyger: #49 <blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div> iama: I want to hear more about this town read too. 1 day later, C-W/Kuz still feels just as contrived.</div></blockquote>Not the only player questioning that read, yet iama completely ignores this question, and somehow Kuz is the only one to take any heat from questioning the town read. Very suspicious.<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>EmpTyger wrote:</cite>There are legitimate reasons to oppose a townread, although I don't think they apply in this instance.</div></blockquote>When he questioned the town read himself, he then jumps on the bandwagon against Kuz for doing so. Opportunistic is an understatement, but he moves on to Rhinox without anyone calling him out on it, so that makes it seem less scummy to me. Leaning Neutral.<br>\n<br>\n4. th3kuzinator: Over-defensive, over-eager, then left. I think he was frustrated, being new to this site, that everyone was jumping on him in his very first game here. Yes, his initial questions would have been better asked elsewhere, but accusing him of \"trying to figure out the status quo\" (C-Worl #28) is a reach, and it's understandable why someone would get frustrated from such an accusation. Also, not the only person to question iama's read, yet took all the heat for it... yeah, I would be frustrated too. Town.<br>\n<br>\n5. ThAdmiral: Random vote #38, despite the fact that a good amount of actual stuff happened before then. It's his way of \"checking in?\" (#51), if he's serious that's not a very good reason. Proceeds to go after Kuz for a long time, only to OMGUS C-Worl, then switch back to Kuz/me as soon as iamausername says so. Opportunistic wagon jumping if I ever saw it. While vote hopping in itself isn't necessarily scummy, ThAdmiral seems to just be for whatever wagon seems most likely to lead to a quick lynch. Leaning Scum.<br>\n<br>\n6. C-Worl: <blockquote><div><cite>sAbLLimINal wrote:</cite>all C-Worl is trying to do is appeal to emotion</div></blockquote>And push quicklynches by doing so, as I've already pointed out. Most recently refusing to give me a single quote to back up his statements, instead opting to say \"you didn't read.\" You would think that presenting evidence would be to his benefit, especially since he was accusing me of not presenting enough. Instead just a \"no, I'm done talking to you,\" emotional much? The most impatient player in this game. Impatient for lynching, impatient in answering questions, and vote switching when iamausername says so. Leaning Scum.<br>\n<br>\n7. iamausername: Had a town read on C-Worl for <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">one line</div> (#39). Didn't answer EmpTyger's request for clarification but voted Kuz for challenging it (easier wagon?). <blockquote><div><cite>iamausername wrote:</cite>no one has indicated a willingness to drop the hammer vote, as far as I remember. I mean, I'd prefer it if someone did, because he's scum, but until that happens, he shouldn't claim.</div></blockquote>How are you so certain he's scum? <blockquote><div><cite>iamausername wrote:</cite>C-Worl is town, ThAd is town</div></blockquote>This brings me to my other point, that I've mentioned before; iamausername seems too sure of himself when he names people town or scum. What makes you think ThAdmiral is town after all the wagon hopping he's done? Leaning Scum.<br>\n<br>\n8. Fishythefish: Goes after sAbLLimINal for mentioning town power role, justified in my opinion. He notices the wagon on Kuz has serious flaws (#74) and makes a good point in his #115 <blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Well, he only called his whole wagon scummy after arguing with every individual player on it.</div></blockquote> Not the biggest poster, and doesn't make very controversial statements or accusations. Maybe a cautious player, maybe a bit of lurking in plain sight. Not too sure about him. Leaning Neutral.<br>\n<br>\n9. Rhinox: Comes in a bit late, but soon posts a real post, so not a big deal in my opinion. <blockquote><div><cite>Rhinox wrote:</cite>kuz asking about gambits and LAL seems like it could be newbscum trying to figure out how much he can get away with</div></blockquote>I disagree with this, just as with C-Worl's #28, asking about the game and trying to feel out other players isn't a scum tell, everyone should be trying to get a feel for other players, and asking about the game is an easy way to start the conversation, especially for someone new to the site. <blockquote><div><cite>Rhinox wrote:</cite>early in the game, when I'm still trying to get started on figuring out player's alignments, I tend to ask questions rather than just coming out and making a point</div></blockquote>Which is exactly what Kuz was doing! A bit hypocritical here. Rhinox redeems himself a bit by questioning ThAdmiral's quick L-1 vote on Kuz, and also this: <blockquote><div><cite>Rhinox wrote:</cite>I questioned iam's town read on cworl because it seemed like a questionable reason to call cworl town.</div></blockquote> So now EmpTyger, Rhinox, Kuz, and myself have questioned that read, yet iamausername has not clarified and only Kuz/me gets attacked for it. Rhinox is suspect for attacking Kuz for asking questions, when he admits to doing the same, but seems OK otherwise.

Reasons to believe me (after I fail to get counterclaimed):<br>\n1. 6/2/1 is horrible for the town; they can very easily not have the majority day 2. You just wouldn't run it.<br>\n2. When Arch flipped scum, we were always going to be short on suspects today, and I was always going to be among them. Killing MK would be madness.<br>\n3. Scum will probably shoot me tonight anyway.<br>\n4. This is always a bad start to a sentence, but even if I <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">was</div> a SK, lynching me today would be neutral. You'd get 1 chance to catch the scum; may as well use that today, and lynch me if someone flips scum and the day doesn't end.", "time": "Wed Jun 01, 2011 6:56 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=17401&start=275", "forum": "53", "thread": "17401"}

In this scenario Rhinoxscum is 8 hours from deadline, wagons split 3-3 scum-town, he's on the town wagon. It's <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">perfect</div> for a no lynch, and there's no more onus on Rhinox than anyone else to switch votes. To get a no lynch, you don't bus there.<br>\n<br>\nSo. I see that as a bad move - that close to deadline, the risk of a NL outweighs the possible confirmation points - but not so bad as to be unrealistic, and the scum motivation for it is weak to non-existent. Rhinox's end of day play still gives me a solid town read on him.<br>\n<br>\nThAd on kuz doesn't look like bussing to me. He puts him to L-1 early in the game, a very dodgy move for a scumbag.

Alternatively, he could have given a \"bah go scum\" type of post and then he gets hammered for realz for claiming scum. Thats the intent of fake-hammer gambits.

It was a protown post.<br>\nb) The people on neither of the L-2 wagons - namely Arch, Emp and Rhinox. I have just realised that in my head Rhinox was on the MK wagon before his switch, but actually he was on a non-wagon, which changes things a little - he'd have caught some flak if there had been a no lynch. More so because he should know better than to cause a no lynch by being on a non-wagon. This weakens my conviction that Rhinox is town. Still, he'd recently been on the ThAd wagon, and could easily have returned, so overall the move has to count in his favour.", "time": "Thu Jun 09, 2011 6:51 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=17401&start=325", "forum": "53", "thread": "17401"}

Thats just an unjustified theory there's really nothing for me to say about it. I see you trying to manipulate me into a corner. First, iam's catch is so good that voting arch is my only play, but then you also argue I was trying to cause a nolynch. None of it makes sense because if I were scum, there was a better play to cause a nolynch (leave my vote where it was, or vote ThAd for a mislynch &gt; no lynch), and there was a better play to bus (just vote to L-1, no fake hammer). My play accomplishes neither very well if I'm scum.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>sAb wrote:</cite>Considering the fact that Arch was scum, if he knew you fake hammered, he could have taken advantaged and claimed a power role or something so that people would unvote him. That's what I would have tried to do if I was Arch.</div></blockquote>But what does my fake hammer have anything to do with what he claims or when? He could have claimed a PR at any time. He could have claimed a PR if instead of fake hammering, I just announced he was at L-1. He could have claimed a PR if someone else put him to L-1. You're trying to link my fake hammer to something arch could have done, but there's nothing to justify the link.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>sAb wrote:</cite>Well as you said it depends on the claim and then seeing if anyone else counter-claimed. But still, wouldn't that be why it would make sense to claim if Arch (still scum) thought you faked hammered?</div></blockquote>Sure, if he actually realized he was only fake hammered and not real hammered. But if I would have voted and said *L-1* he still could have claimed a PR the same way. So what I'm getting at is trying to figure out why you're trying to make my fake hammer seem more evil than it really is. If I'm arch's scum partner and wanted to set him up to make a PR claim, I didn't have to fake hammer, all I had to do was put him at L-1. <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>sAb wrote:</cite>I get what you tried to do about trying to get the \"bah go town\" kind of post. But if Arch claimed a PR (and actually was that PR), then that would hurt the town, since at that time we didn't know there was a doc in play to protect him so scum would target him.</div></blockquote>[/quote]Hurt the town compared to what? If I follow what you've been arguing, you're saying my fake hammer could have cause arch to claim a PR, and if he really was a PR that would hurt the town because scum could target him. Are you comparing this to me not voting at all, or me straight up voting him to L-1 rather than fake hammering? I still argue that a PR not getting lynched and getting nked instead is better than a PR getting lynched, but worse than the PR not claiming at all.   <br>\n<br>\nLet me ask you this, would you be questioning me all the same today if I'd have just voted arch to L-1 and not fake-hammered?", "time": "Mon Jun 13, 2011 4:56 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=17401&start=350", "forum": "53", "thread": "17401"}

I did not vote ThAd for agreeing with any case I was making. In between my posts, kuz's posting made me not suspect him as strongly, and ThAd looked like he could be opportunistically pushing an easy mislynch, so I unvoted kuz and voted ThAd. Emp's argument basically boils down to that because I voted kuz at one point, that I should be locked into thinking kuz was scum, and that I shouldn't suspect anyone else who votes kuz. That's completely rediculous.<br>\n<br>\nWe went back and forth a little bit, and then emp unvoted me for no explained reason. Until later in the day...</div><br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>emp 17 wrote:</cite>C-Worl and Rhinox are proposing that I'm mafia because I voted MK (who they are saying is mafia) instead of voting Archaist (who would have to be town). <br>\nHow about Occam's razor- the guy pushing a lynch on Archaist despite saying the above is the guilty one?<br>\nAnd with him, Rhinox who meanwhile is arguing that mafia would be doing the exact thing he himself is doing.<br>\nEspecially after C-Worl declares Rhinox town for voting MK right after declaring I'm obvscum for voting MK.<br>\n<br>\nI made a mistake letting up on Rhinox. It won't happen tomorrow. If there weren't less than 36 hours left and 0 current voters, it wouldn't have happened today. As it is:<br>\nVote: C-Worl</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">There are 2 misreps here. Firstly, I didn't propost that emp was mafia. I commented on what C-worl said about emp being mafia with MK, and actually at the end of that commentary that implied that I didn't think emp/MK very likely due to emp unvoting after I made MK the leading wagon. The second misrep is emp saying \"rhinox is arguing that mafia would be doing the same thing he is doing\" - which wasn't the case at all, and I've tried to explain it, but to briefly go through it again:<br>\n<br>\n-cworl says emp/MK are scum<br>\n-emp is voting mk<br>\n-MK reacts poorly as if Cworl struck a nerve, so I vote MK<br>\n-emp unovtes<br>\n-I comment that emp's unvote doesn't make sense if he's really scum with MK because if MK would flip scum, emp would look suspicious for unvoting immediately after MK became the leading wagon.<br>\n-Emp misreps me by (1) saying I'm arguing that he's scum, and (2) saying that I said scum would be voting MK and I'm voting MK so I'm the one who's scum.<br>\n<br>\nBy the way, emp has been accusing me of omgus, but as of this post, emp think cworl and I are attacking him, and he ends up voting cworl (rather than kuz, the guy he was pushing as scum all day while he was voting elsewhere), and spouting out some rhetoric about how he won't let up on me tomorrow. So, he suspects the 2 people he thinks were attacking him (even though I wasn't even attacking him at that point). I don't even think thats OMGUS by the way - emp was clearly trying to argue that me and cworl were scum because in his opinion we were making bad arguments, which by the way is exactly the reason I suspect emp today.<br>\n<br>\nMoving on to day 2:<br>\n<br>\nIn his first post of the day, he immediately votes me, and reaffirms a couple of the misreps he already used in D1 (namely, that I only unvoted kuz because he was getting votes, and that I'm scum because I was still voting MK after saying if emp was scum with MK I wouldn't have expected him to unvote after MK became the leading wagon [and I still don't understand how emp is making any sense with that last one, and no matter how many times I had asked for clarification, all he ever did was reiterate that I was scum because my vote was on MK - my vote had nothing to do with me speculating that if emp was scum with MK, removing his vote after MK became the leading wagon would look suspicious if MK ever flipped scum. After MK flipped town, it would have been the end of it, except MK kept insisting that I was being hypicritical scum basically])<br>\n<br>\nThis is not a misrep, but its a bad argument:</div><br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>emp 24 wrote:</cite>Whereas with Rhinox, as just pointed out: he hopped onto both the ThAd and the MK counterwagons.  He only voted Archaist hours before deadline, only after your catch all but nailed Archaist's coffin.</div></blockquote><div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Given as a reason for why I am scum, but emp was on the Rhinox, and MK, AND cworl counterwagons, and never getting back on the kuz/arch wagon at the end of the day despite calling kuz/arch scum all day from off the wagon.<br>\n<br>\nThis is another bad argument:</div><br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>emp wrote:</cite>Rhinox:<br>\nYou found a 3rd choice: Make it seem like you wanted Archaist to die while actually effecting a no-lynch. Best case C-Worl's attacks against me and MK carry. Worst case Archaist dies anyhow the next day buy there's one less lynch for the town.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">this is a bad argument because I as scum don't gain anything from this course of action. Suppose I was scum trying to cause a no-lynch, if the no-lynch fails and arch gets lynched, then I would know I would be suspected for trying to cause a no-lynch when scum was about to be lynched, and if somehow my alleged plan to cause a no-lynch succeeded, then arch would probably be lynched the next day anyways (if not me), and then I would definitely be under high suspicion for causing a no-lynch rather than a scum lynch once arch flipped. 3 better things for me to do if I'm scum: 1) do nothing and hope a no-lynch just happens, 2) vote ThAd and cause a mislynch instead, or 3) just outright bus without the games that don't help me if I'm scum.<br>\n<br>\nThis is getting long so I'll just skip to the last misrep, where emp said I'm scum for allegedly expanding my suspect list to include everyone. I think we've said enough about that recently.</div><br>\n<br>\n<br>\nBasically, emp hasn't made a single valid point against me, but I'll repeat that its not the bad points that are the problem - sometimes townies make bad points - its that he isn't trying to unbiasly determine whether his points are valid, he's just declaring them to be valid and hasn't had to back them up because everyone else either thinks he's town or I'm scum, so he's been getting a pass. Up until now, I'd have probably been willing to except if emp admitted he had confirmation bias and attempted to legitimately reexamine his reads - aside from emp's bad cases and misreps against me, I've been more suspicious of ThAd.", "time": "Tue Jun 28, 2011 9:44 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=17401&start=400", "forum": "53", "thread": "17401"}

He wears his heart on his sarcastic, arrogant sleeve, and as such is by far easier to read than anyone else in this game has been. His responses to the formation of the wagon on him are extremely telling.<br>\n<br>\nReaction to C-Worl's vote:<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>t3hkuzinator wrote:</cite>Oh really? That's cute that you are trying to look pro-town by telling me that I should learn from playing on here long enough. Ill get back to you on that when I finish my first game on here.<br>\n<br>\nIt also amuses me that you are accusing me of fluff considering your 22 is about as devoid of content as it comes. You didn't need to tell me your personal history nor do you need to inform me of the skill level required, but you did anyway. As for the last bit, please continue guessing at the intent behind my posts. You're really making headway.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nHe's sarcastic and dismissive. He assumes himself to be above C-Worl, and does not consider his vote to be a threat. This is useful as a control group for his reactions to townies voting for him, as we know C-Worl's alignment, of course.<br>\n<br>\nReaction to Rhinox's vote:<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>t3hkuzinator wrote:</cite>@Rhinox: Overdefensive? It's called I don't let anyone try to take advantage of me. I am known throughout smashboards for doing town gambits. It's just what I like to do because it makes the game more enjoyable/exciting for me. Since this is my first game on the site, I wanted to hear the site-specific view of it. Why you both are assuming malicious intent behind the question is beyond me. Also, Iama has a town read on Cworl and his phrasing, not me.<br>\n<br>\n@Iama: Are you honestly clearing CWorl from saying the word scummates instead of scummate? You do realize any half decent scum player could consciously on unconsciously throw that in? What bothers me more is that CWorl actually picked up on where you were going with it before you explained it.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nThere's other key stuff here too, but first, the Rhinox vote. kuz obviously feels a little more threatened here, and his reaction is a little less dismissive, but it still bears a lot of similarities. He addresses Rhinox directly with a self-aggrandizing paragraph, and is highly defensive and confrontational.<br>\n<br>\nFurthermore, his \"Why you both are assuming malicious intent behind the question is beyond me.\" is telling; he perceives the attacks on him as a united front, not as two separate and distinct events. This suggests that there is no difference in the motivation of the two of them in his mind.<br>\n<br>\nThen we have his obvious upset at my pinning C-Worl as town for what he percieved to be invalid reasons. He makes no attempt to disguise his emotions here or anywhere else, and that was his downfall on D1, and I hope it will ultimately prove to be the downfall of his partner too.<br>\n<br>\nReaction to my vote:<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>t3hkuzinator wrote:</cite>Why do people keep assuming I am upset? lol. Apparently any type of aggressive posting is taken as a sign of being butthurt.

That basically sums up his response to all three votes so far.<br>\n<br>\nReaction to ThAd's vote:<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>t3hkuzinator wrote:</cite>@Emp: What? I was asking the question to get a general feel for the site. My playstyle had nothing to do with the question.<br>\n<br>\n@Admiral and IAAUS: Show me where I was upset. You're blowing my posts way out of proportion.<br>\n<br>\nThe wagon on me is so freaking scummy and agreed with Mitsuru that Admiral's vote was flat out disgusting.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nfollowed by flaking entirely from the game and the site. <br>\n<br>\nHere we see t3hkuzinator throwing his toys out of the pram. There's no dismissive \"it's my playstyle, get over it\" attitude here. Instead we get emotive language like 'so freaking scummy' and 'flat out disgusting'. He's very clearly moved from being mildly irritated to being genuinely upset, and it is my firm belief that the most, maybe even the only likely explanation for this sudden mood swing is that the one person he thought he could rely on had turned on him too.<br>\n<br>\nMore to come...", "time": "Tue Jul 05, 2011 1:46 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=17401&start=425", "forum": "53", "thread": "17401"}

Clearly, if he believes this is a universal truth, then it must be true of his own scumplay, no? Wanna guess how often ThAd calls people town, and how often he calls people scum? The answer may surprise you.<br>\n<br>\nI mean, given that the key point of my - and therefore also ThAd's - case against kuz was that he was upset that I correctly identified C-Worl as town, you'd assume that somewhere in ThAd's posts, you would find some declaration that C-Worl is town. But you'd be wrong. He talks around the subject for a long stretch by discussing town reads in the abstract, but never actually gives an opinion on C-Worl. That is, until C-Worl made his dumbass vote on ThAd to \"get the game moving\", at which point ThAd immediately starts calling him scum.<br>\n<br>\nTogether, me and Fishy talk him out of that vote and back around to the Archaist (kuz) wagon, but despite agreeing with Fishy's point that C-Worl's behaviour was dumb but not scummy, he <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3057785#p3057785\" class=\"postlink\">continues to suspect C-Worl</a>.

Does not compute.<br>\n<br>\nIn fact, ThAd never calls anyone town throughout D1. One of his final posts on D1 says that he would \"be willing to move [his] vote to sab, mk or c-worl\" at deadline, implying scumreads on the three of them.

If Rhinox had voted ThAd, Arch would very very likely not have died.<br>\nI think 3) is beyond doubt - there were only hours to go, and there were two wagons at L-2. Voting either one of them makes it hugely more likely to succeed. The others are obviously matters of judgement, but AFAIC there's just no reason to think that Rhinox was forced to take the only route that didn't mark him as Arch's buddy.<br>\n<br>\nI don't think Rhinox must be innocent. But I think his end of day actions make little sense for scum. When I look at day 1, I see that if Rhinox is scum he killed his partner in a situation where he didn't have to, and was never going to look that good for doing so. iam or ThAd being scum would have had to bus their partner hard; Rhinox being scum would have had to avoid being on the actual wagon, but change his mind at the death then make sure his partner got lynched anyway. All the scum death for little of the distancing power. It's possible that Rhinox decided the evidence against his partner was so overwhelming that a mislynch or a no lynch would inevitably lead to their deaths over the next two days.

There's no actual inconsistency here, and anyone who had an inclination to defend Archaist could easily have spotted this.<br>\n<br>\nSo, no, I do not believe that Rhinox was simply bringing about the inevitable.

He's being pressured to claim.  He can't be sarcastically dismissive any more, because he's under real pressure.  Whatever he was trying to accomplish (perhaps being the stereotypical newbie bandwagon that gets early votes but dissolves when it \"forms too quickly\", but that may be giving him too much credit), it didn't work, and with his plan having failed he had no further interest in playing.<br>\n<br>\nAlso, there isn't some clear dichotomy of pattern of reactions between ThAd and not-ThAd.  You're overlooking his reaction to me, for instance.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nCard 2: <br>\n*I* had the same reaction to C-Worl that ThAd had.  <br>\nOn the other hand, while we were all reexamining each other, Rhinox laid low.  D2, instead of trying to figure out who was guilty, his interest was in avoiding the lynch.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nCard 3:<br>\nQuickly looking through the linked game- I don't think that's necessarily conclusive of anything: the mafia got a bonus daykill if they bussed each other.  Moreover, ThAd coordinated the bussing pregame with his partners, which contradicts what you are assuming happened for your \"card 1\".<br>\n(And unless your point is that ThAd as town wouldn't lynch mafia D1... so what?)<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nCard 4:<br>\nAgain, I had the same reaction as ThAd when you did that.

Your play D2 was troubling, and it took reviewing D1 to put me at ease.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nCard 5:<br>\nStill no.  I mentioned several alternatives D2, but there's most prominently the fact that C-Worl was the only one who Archaist attacked.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nCard 6:<br>\nStill no.  It's a point in ThAd's favor that Archaist treated ThAd and MK the same.<br>\nOr since you seem to like speculative theories- Archaist's comafia Rhinox just switched his vote to MK.

Again, I don't care what you are trying to insist now about yourself, without any evidence.  I'm talking about from *Rhinox*'s point-of-view at the time.  From his perspective, there's not a single shred of evidence for him to think there's any chance of you suddenly abandoning a still-viable Archaist lynch to follow him to ThAd.  Not after your attacks against Archaist, not after your [249], not after stating that Archaist's partner by process-of-elimination was either Rhinox or me, not after even just repeating how you had \"declared C-worl and ThAd to be town\".<br>\n<br>\nAnd there isn't a shred of evidence for Rhinox to think that Archaist wouldn't be considered a viable lynch without Rhinox's vote.  Archaist is at lynch-2 and there are 4 players (sAb, Fishy, MK, and myself) yet to post after your [249] and C-Worl declaring it the \"catch of the game\".  All it takes is one of us to agree and Archaist is at lynch-1, and there's no reason why any of us would think it an \"obviously flawed argument\".<br>\n<br>\n[Also, you're tripping up over yourself in your contorted effort to justify this case against ThAd.  You just rebutted your own card 5, because if you were making \"obviously flawed arguments\" while C-Worl was doing the actual browbeating by calling it the \"catch of the game\", that kind of contradicts your point argument that there's no reason to nightkill C-Worl over you.
