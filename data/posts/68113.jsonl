Don't rules-lawyer.<br>\n1. All <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=6470\" class=\"postlink\">site-wide rules</a> apply.<br>\n2. Don't quote private Moderator-information, even if it's not real. You can paraphrase if you want.<br>\n3. Please don't communicate privately with each other unless your role PM says you can or you're a mafia member.<br>\n4. Please be active. As a general guideline, one post every 48 hours is the bare minimum.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Night Actions</div><br>\n1. Submit all night actions by the deadline or I will assume you don't want to make any actions.<br>\n2. If you don't want to make any actions, PM \"No Action\" to me. <br>\n3. For the mafia, the latest post with a decision to kill that is <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">bolded</div> will be the final kill order. Remember to specify who is making the kill.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Voting, Deadlines and Death</div><br>\n1. You can lynch a player by getting more than half the surviving players to vote them.<br>\n2. Once a majority happens you can't unvote.<br>\n3. Everyone including the lynched player can continue posting until I post the flip.<br>\n4. I won't count a vote unless it's clear who you're voting for.<br>\n5. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Use the vote/unvote tag to vote or unvote. I will not count votes or unvotes not in vote/unvote tags.</div><br>\n6. You can also vote No Lynch if you want.<br>\n7. I will post a vote count regularly.<br>\n8. Each game day will last two weeks. There will be no extensions of the deadline. <br>\n9. Each game night will last two days. There will be no extensions or shortening of the deadline.<br>\n10. When players die, they can't post any more. At all. There are no exceptions.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Activity</div><br>\n1. If you have not posted in 48 hours, I will see if you have any prods. If you do, I will replace you. If you don't I will prod you.<br>\n2. If you do not respond to a prod within 24 hours, I will replace you.<br>\n3. I may replace players at any time if I see they are just posting to avoid prods and are not really playing the game.<br>\n4. If you are not going to be able to play for large amounts of time, consider replacing out. To be honest, I don't really like players who go V/LA for long periods of time without replacing out. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Miscellaneous</div><br>\n1. Don't be an asshole to people. If you don't know what this rule means, either look at General Game Rule 0 or replace out. <br>\n2. Red color is my color. Please don't make posts with this color.<br>\n3. Do not use small text, invisible text, cryptography or other weird posting tricks. <br>\n4. If you want to make a public request to me(for example asking for a prod on someone), bold it so I won't miss it. <br>\n5. If you want to make a private request to me, PM me.<br>\n6. Mafia members can talk during the day.<br>\n7. There are 10 town members and 3 mafia members. No third parties or additional factions.<br>\n8. If you break any of these rules, I will kill you. <br>\nVanilla Townie Role PM:</div>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>\nYou are a <div style=\"display:inline;color:green\">Vanilla Townie</div><br>\n<br>\nAbilities: <br>\nYou have no abilities.<br>\n<br>\nWin Condition:<br>\nYou win when all threats to the town are eliminated and there is at least one town player alive.<br>\n<br>\nGame Thread:<br>\nThe game thread is here: [ ]\n</div></blockquote>", "time": "Mon Aug 22, 2016 6:21 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=68113&start=0", "forum": "53", "thread": "68113"}

This is why I'll probably be NK'd early this game because I'm always NK'd early as town because scum just hate me. <br>\n<br>\nI'm like those diet pill Google ads that say, \"DOCTORS HATE HIM!!!\" except I'm a mafia player and instead of doctors it's the scum that hate me.</div></blockquote>\nSo guys if Rb isn't NK'd early, He's scum.</div></blockquote>\nWhy? and also, why you sheeping?<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8272037#p8272037\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8272037#p8272037\" data-post-id=\"8272037\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 77</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9495\">Cass</a> wrote:</cite>Ok, I'll try this sheeping thing... see what happens <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\"><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: Comparing realities</span><br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Gameplay506</span><br>\n<br>\nReally a serious vote though, gameplays responses so far seem seriously off.

It is very early day one with not that great information to go off of and having a massive pressure vote on another player is going to do pretty much nothing. because there isn't much they can do at this stage. They could go back over and try to get information out to defend there position but there really isn't much of that to go on. so right now all that pressure will only demotivate someone who is town and make scum feel more meh about posting for a bit till the pressure drops.

However, seeing as someone pointed out that she had done the same thing in a past town game of hers, that is a solid NAI post. She feels town because she stays consistent with the style of play that she says she uses(being open) and by saying that she plays open, she would make it hard on herself as scum to play any other way because she'd have to commit to being open all the time, which is not easy for scum to do. Basically, pointing out her play style is bad for her as scum, because if she veers off from it, she's immediately suspect.<br>\n<br>\nrb - I do like that he chose to get out of RVS the way he did.

Gameplay's wagon does seem suspect, so that might indicate town, but his recent responses to rb's accusations seems a bit too defensive.

I was being honest when I said that gameplay looks like someone trying to force themselves to banter and be relaxed. I think that's evident regardless of gameplay's alignment here. I think them trying to discredit me and cut down my interaction is bad play, potentially scummy but not like a glaring scumtell. <br>\n<br>\nOverall I highlighted these things and people commented on the stuff that went on - mostly people were focussed on the interactions between gameplay/ryan/me right? That's what town should/would do, focus on trying to sort the game. But Dierfire? He's just like, \"well I don't have reads but I think rb is town so I'll sheep him\" - cue alarm bells. <br>\n<br>\nOf everyone who got on that wagon, Dierfire has by far the weakest stated reasoning and also, has thrown some shade around and is fence-sitting on a bunch of stuff. Their play is overall scummy. Also I think you're misunderstanding the intent of this strategy - of course it's imperfect, every strategy is imperfect early game as town because if there was a perfect strategy that anyone knew then town would always win, but they don't.

Pointing out that scum have day talk, ostensibly for easy early town credit, since the unthinking townie response from someone who hasn't read the opening posts as closely might think, \"Oh yeah, good point, thanks for pointing that out Naomi,\" and subconsciously label her as town, or at least, drop her into a town<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">ier</div> slot in their reads.<br>\n<br>\n2. The bolded section is a not-too-well concealed hint that says \"Hey everyone, just so it's very clear, I didn't learn that the scum have day talk from being part of a scum day talk thread; I learned it from the setup\" which seems like a way to subtly reinforce her standing as town in people's heads. And the fact that she's already told us she's going to try to do that is a can of WIFOM and introducing that at the start of the game in such a fashion is nothing but scummy.<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Naomi-Tan</span><br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8271469#p8271469\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8271469#p8271469\" data-post-id=\"8271469\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 9</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=28086\">rb</a> wrote:</cite>@Naomi - how am I supposed to interpret the fact that you'rre pre-announcing that you pre-announced this thing last game?

So Null. <br>\n<br>\n4) Saru - Anyone who makes me have to look up an iso to remember who they are really needs to be more active. However, there first post gave good reads and there look into a players meta was certainly a change of pace I dislike how they singled them out while Nulling most of everyone. Additionally they kinda acted friendly to me and rb who at this time. The Rb thing doesn't seem too natural as he has them on a town lean close to null and literally says that \"His reasoning for scum reading Gameplay is somewhat of a reach\" which I'm interupting as; I have no idea how this is scum hunting. Which is a strange thing to have in a town pile.

Like there scum hunting seems kinda non-sensical and I just came out of a game with them where I was sure there slot was town this new play style just conflicts with his play style last game that I'm suspicious of him but thats mostly from my last experience, as he wasn't as egotistical and it looked much easier to follow. <br>\n<br>\n9) RyanK - I think they also may be scum based on there early interacts with rb. he didn't really question or look deep into rb's thoughts and just flipped to sheep him pretty quickly after maybe one block of text joining a weak train at the drop of a hat.<br>\n<br>\n10) golden009 - Nullish? I don't like how he inflamed dierfires train with a second post and vote on the matter and I find this more scummy than Saru as he was looking / talking about just the sheeping he did when it wasn't like no one else sheeped and ignored them all, it seems that they may have noticed our weird feelings and decided to try and push for them and thats kinda why I'm suspicious of them?<br>\n<br>\n11) Chuck - waits 14 years, 4 months, and 17 days for this moment. and doesn't take the moment to post. maybe he was being literal and meant this particular 90 seconds. This is just a funny way of me saying they havn't posted since page one, NULL<br>\n<br>\n12) Cass - okay doki he has said a bit and joined the train, but I'm not really so scum reading him. it looks like he was putting effort into understanding and talked a bit before going so... may be town may not and really I don't have a strong read here they need to post//comment more.<br>\n<br>\n13) Martha Zolanski - and here is my number one scum read. more on that coming in my next post.<br>\n<br>\nOMG this Pedit x5 combo!

I read things but don't have time to make a huge quote filled post now. Some points:<br>\n- Becoming more nervous about Naomi, because she is so very nervous. But that might be null, because she is so open about it, making it all so wifom. Sigh.<br>\n- Dierfire gives me a scum vibe, quoting weak statistics and other non-arguments as reasons for joining a wagon.<br>\n- Ryan also looks scummy, isn't contributing<br>\n- rb still sounds like town to me, plus I agree that any kind of initiative and leadership is a good thing for town<br>\n- It is annoying that not everyone has posted yet. But probably means nothing, right? I guess these people havan't even picked up their role pm's yet? ( is there a way to know? Or just to wait for the mod to update?)<br>\n- The attacks on Martha piqued my interest - it could be Naomi- scum trying to deflect attention from Dierfire- scum.

The way I see it is; there was 4 people on that train and only one really added more to the game than the subject at hand yet there the person who got singled out by others and pushed to L-2. This seems more like a scum move than a town move, so I decided to deflect to aid them.

My bad, y'all.<br>\n<br>\nI had wanted and planned to write a good, meaty post, however, due to the amount of time that it took to get through all of that, I will try to condense and say as much as possible in the shortest time possible because I need to tend to my family soon.

With Martha I saw the arguments but may have skimmed too fast. I'll reread some of it tomorrow.<br>\n<br>\nI really wanted to contribute more but I've got to get going.

In Mini 1800, you were a lot more cautious about committing to a vote, instead choosing to give your full thoughts on most of the early posts that game before actually casting your vote. I'm not sure that you actually thought that the gameplay wagon was a good start, given that a good start vote for you is usually backed up by more evidence than \"x is town therefore y is scum.\"\n<blockquote><div><cite>Martha Zolanski wrote:</cite>Your town read on Naomi looks more like her way of not getting suspected. Being open about that makes her earn a town read thus she'll get a town read. Then, She'll never be suspected as mafia.</div></blockquote>\nI'm not sure I agree with that assessment. If Naomi chooses to announce that her play-style will be open, wouldn't it hurt her as scum to do so? Scum don't want to announce that they'll play a certain way, for fear of being caught out if they veer off that play. Do you disagree? <br>\n<br>\nI think Naomi is likely town here. I don't really see the point of so much WIFOM from her, as it introduces unwanted attention unto her. Sure, she could be doing some crazy reverse psychology play, but that requires a lot of assumptions, and Occam's Razor would laugh at me for that.<br>\n<br>\nRyan is someone who seems to be all over the place. His drastic vote changes feel like him throwing things at a wall and hoping they stick. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8276179#p8276179\">308</a> especially looks bad because I don't see what a vote there does to stir discussion, exactly? Can't you just ask the question on it's own? Slight scum read.<br>\n<br>\nI like rb's <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8274886#p8274886\">228</a>. I agree that some plan is better than no plan. Again, initiative is usually townie, and the fact that rb keeps consistent with that thought process(explaining his plan, why it was good or bad, etc.) gives me a strong town read on him. Also, yes, he clearly sees why the votes on Naomi are silly.<br>\n<br>\nGolden said that his suspicion of Dierfire became more solidified when I chose to vote Dierfire for similar reasons as him. I really don't like that. @Golden:Where does peer pressure end, and sheeping begin? Null for now.<br>\n<br>\nGameplay's case on Ryan seems to have merit, especially the point about dumb-telling, which also pinged me. I didn't like his aggressiveness towards rb early on though, it seemed superficial. His read on rb seems ok, but not great. I want more elaboration on that. @Gameplay: what about newbscum suggests they can't be active scum-hunters? Null for now.<br>\n<br>\nCass' <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8275898#p8275898\">298</a> comes off as trying to force a town-bloc with the more active players and feels like shade being thrown towards the lurkers. Earlier in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8275559#p8275559\">272</a> he said that people probably hadn't picked up their role pm's yet so it probably means nothing. If it means nothing, why even point out that those players could be the scum team? Inconsistent thinking. Slight scum read.<br>\n<br>\nPitoli is active, asks a lot of questions(particularly like <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8276796#p8276796\">348</a>), and views things from both sides before going further with it. Strong town read.<br>\n<br>\nNot sure about Martha atm tbh. I'll revisit this later.<br>\n<br>\nChuck's reasoning to scum read Naomi doesn't seem very strong. Like, I understand WHY her vote/unvote of Cass might look like an empty gesture, but I don't really think it suggests that she's bowing down to Cass' demands or wishes. Seems like she was just trying to prove a point. Most of Chuck's catch-up posts don't really say anything besides a scum read on Naomi. I want him to talk about other things besides Naomi to help me form a more accurate read. What did you think of the gameplay wagon? What about Dierfire's wagon?<br>\n<br>\nI like BBT's responses to Naomi on replace in. They were ballsy as hell. I'm a sucker for that kind of stuff.

In Mini 1800, you were a lot more cautious about committing to a vote, instead choosing to give your full thoughts on most of the early posts that game before actually casting your vote. I'm not sure that you actually thought that the gameplay wagon was a good start, given that a good start vote for you is usually backed up by more evidence than \"x is town therefore y is scum.\"\n<blockquote><div><cite>Martha Zolanski wrote:</cite>Your town read on Naomi looks more like her way of not getting suspected. Being open about that makes her earn a town read thus she'll get a town read. Then, She'll never be suspected as mafia.</div></blockquote>\nI'm not sure I agree with that assessment. If Naomi chooses to announce that her play-style will be open, wouldn't it hurt her as scum to do so? Scum don't want to announce that they'll play a certain way, for fear of being caught out if they veer off that play. Do you disagree? <br>\n<br>\nI think Naomi is likely town here. I don't really see the point of so much WIFOM from her, as it introduces unwanted attention unto her. Sure, she could be doing some crazy reverse psychology play, but that requires a lot of assumptions, and Occam's Razor would laugh at me for that.<br>\n<br>\nRyan is someone who seems to be all over the place. His drastic vote changes feel like him throwing things at a wall and hoping they stick. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8276179#p8276179\">308</a> especially looks bad because I don't see what a vote there does to stir discussion, exactly? Can't you just ask the question on it's own? Slight scum read.<br>\n<br>\nI like rb's <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8274886#p8274886\">228</a>. I agree that some plan is better than no plan. Again, initiative is usually townie, and the fact that rb keeps consistent with that thought process(explaining his plan, why it was good or bad, etc.) gives me a strong town read on him. Also, yes, he clearly sees why the votes on Naomi are silly.<br>\n<br>\nGolden said that his suspicion of Dierfire became more solidified when I chose to vote Dierfire for similar reasons as him. I really don't like that. @Golden:Where does peer pressure end, and sheeping begin? Null for now.<br>\n<br>\nGameplay's case on Ryan seems to have merit, especially the point about dumb-telling, which also pinged me. I didn't like his aggressiveness towards rb early on though, it seemed superficial. His read on rb seems ok, but not great. I want more elaboration on that. @Gameplay: what about newbscum suggests they can't be active scum-hunters?

Earlier in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8275559#p8275559\">272</a> he said that people probably hadn't picked up their role pm's yet so it probably means nothing.

Strong town read.<br>\n<br>\nNot sure about Martha atm tbh. I'll revisit this later.<br>\n<br>\nChuck's reasoning to scum read Naomi doesn't seem very strong. Like, I understand WHY her vote/unvote of Cass might look like an empty gesture, but I don't really think it suggests that she's bowing down to Cass' demands or wishes. Seems like she was just trying to prove a point. Most of Chuck's catch-up posts don't really say anything besides a scum read on Naomi. I want him to talk about other things besides Naomi to help me form a more accurate read. What did you think of the gameplay wagon?

I understand gameplay admitting their own frustration/demotivation because it was a dumb wagon.

To my recollection, it is rare for a new Mafia player to point out this pattern of \"tells\" and then act on them (a slightly more common pattern would be to pose them as questions and wait to see how they are received).<br>\n<br>\n---<br>\nI am also reading pitoli as Town. The analysis in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8274805#p8274805\">223</a> of my much-discussed vote is a good one, and is consistent with reading and understanding (and more importantly, trying to understand) the thread. It is also preceded by questions that inform the analysis. I'm taking this as evidence that pitoli is developing reads and analysis.<br>\n<br>\nI'll additionally cite asking rb about golden009 (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8275138#p8275138\">251</a>) and Martha about Naomi-Tan (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8276796#p8276796\">348</a>). Those are both players on whom pitoli already had reads--this is more evidence of analyzing the expressed reads of others as a way to analyze alignment.<br>\n<br>\n---<br>\nI have to go now.

The central points that I received were that Naomi-Tan is afraid of being lynched, plays uncertainly, and engages in LAMIST behavior to avoid a lynch. On all of these counts, I trust our collective ability to tell the difference between Town players engaging in those behaviors and Mafia players engaging in those behaviors, and I don't see how this announcement reduces our ability to do so.<br>\nShe delayed her vote for a long time (presumably related to her \"uncertain\" style), but when she did cast one in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8275006#p8275006\">238</a> it was preceded by what appears to be a narrowing process; she identified a set of players for analysis (votes on the gameplay506 wagon) in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8274422#p8274422\">210</a> and developed opinions between there and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8274975#p8274975\">236</a> before settling on Martha.

She doesn't seem coordinated enough for such a tactic. In fact, I find her posts increasingly hard to follow. But I like this wagon, in fact wouldn't mind if it turned into a lynch - especially with a self- hammer! Go for it, Martha! Unless you are in fact town, then start scum- hunting instead.<br>\n<br>\nAnd now she's saying l-2 isn't bad, because scum wouldn't quick hammer, in dirct contradiction with her earlier post (on a tablet, so sorry not going to look it up, but it's in my previous post where I vote her).</div></blockquote>\n\"obviously\" you don't have daytalk?<br>\n<br>\nIf you aren't following their posts isn't that kind of a red flag? I feel like that was the case for me, there were so many other things that looked initially scummy like all the deflection re: voting ryan for example, I latched onto the one thing which I'm sure is town. I think the rest is just Martha being automatically flaily and semi-literate.<br>\n<br>\nI ask why it's obvious that you don't have daytalk because that's obviously not the case.<br>\n<br>\nAnd I've always had this theory that whenever someone says something like that (initially meant as in response to when people say \"r u town??\" \"ofc lol\"), it's because they're scum automatically parsing it to \"are you claiming town?\". And they're subconsciously like \"yes, of course i am claiming town!\", and then they leave the \"of course\" behind. But the only time I noticed it the person was actually town. But this seems like a more pure form (since it wasn't in response to a clich&#233; question). So you're probably scum.</div></blockquote>\n\nYeah, that attack is so predictable and makes me see you as scummier. The daytalk thing is a weak thing for me to say, i know this. Because it is only obvious to me and everyone knows that - and I know everyone knows and that I will convince exactly zero people with such a claim, so it's NAI. Latching onto a thing like that is scummy. All it means is that I can't defend myself from a timing question, you do understand that, right? There's nothing useful to say against such an accusation. You can bring it back up if Martha or I ever flips scum.<br>\n<br>\nNot liking Martha's soft claim, but it does sound more like bad town play than lying scum, so, with an annoyed sigh:<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: Martha</span> <br>\n<br>\nThen this seems like a good lynch:<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: RyanK</span> <br>\nAttacking people for the weakest reasons, accusing them of nonsense and things they didn't say, voting in all the safe places without much in the way of reasoning and just not at all looking town.", "time": "Sat Aug 27, 2016 3:12 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=68113&start=575", "forum": "53", "thread": "68113"}

Unless you are in fact town, then start scum- hunting instead.<br>\n<br>\nAnd now she's saying l-2 isn't bad, because scum wouldn't quick hammer, in dirct contradiction with her earlier post (on a tablet, so sorry not going to look it up, but it's in my previous post where I vote her).</div></blockquote>\n\"obviously\" you don't have daytalk?<br>\n<br>\nIf you aren't following their posts isn't that kind of a red flag?

And they're subconsciously like \"yes, of course i am claiming town!\", and then they leave the \"of course\" behind. But the only time I noticed it the person was actually town.

Because it is only obvious to me and everyone knows that - and I know everyone knows and that I will convince exactly zero people with such a claim, so it's NAI. Latching onto a thing like that is scummy. All it means is that I can't defend myself from a timing question, you do understand that, right? There's nothing useful to say against such an accusation. You can bring it back up if Martha or I ever flips scum.</div></blockquote>\n???<br>\n<br>\nI don't think you and Martha are scum who coorinated in daychat. This isn't coherent.

Going to keep my vote here for now. <br>\n<br>\nRyan is a very strange character in my eyes. Like, the way he posts and the questions he asks come off as VI, but it seems almost TOO VI. To the point where I feel like he's playing that status up after Expedience pointed out that he's playing as obvious town. I keep going back and forth on him, but his recent post where he picked at pitoli's post for semantics for like half a page(slight exaggeration) just looked really bad. And I think he knows how bad it looked, but also that's what he's trying to do, and so on and so forth. It's very hard to tell. I have to agree with Cass though in that it feels like his play isn't doing anything to progress the game, but only giving the perception of doing so. The jumpy vote play feels like he's looking for reactions, but he never really follows up and then just moves on. It's inconsistent in that regard. <br>\n<br>\nAs for golden, your <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8280973#p8280973\">511</a> feels very convoluted. Still don't like your reasoning. Or, atleast, I don't understand it. I don't get how my vote made you want to look closer at Dier. If you were already voting him, then you must have had reasons of your own for this. How did my vote add on to those reasons?<br>\n<br>\nThe whole thing about Martha's and Cass' posts lining up in terms of vote timing also feels somewhat coincidental. Like, I think something like 3 wagons(feel free to correct me on this) have happened so far, and so I don't see how something like that can't happen purely by coincidence. @pitoli: is it more the timing of their votes or the reasoning that felt too similar? Or both?<br>\n<br>\nI like Expedience's entry into the game. They seem to want to find out who's town instead of just outright scum. Considering there are more town than scum in a game of mafia, looking for town first over looking for mafia first is a legit strategy. And a pretty pro-town one. Helps with PoE.

She's either a very easily-influenced townie or scum with a reason to be riding those shifts in momentum. I think what first pinged me was the fact that Martha was so nonchalant about sheeping Cass onto the gameplay wagon (their words not mine, see below). It didn't really read to me like they were asserting pressure onto gameplay - they just wanted to wagon.

The others aren't nearly that strong. Also I do make sure to look for distancing type behaviours - honestly Glitch on Chuck looks like that.

She's either a very easily-influenced townie or scum with a reason to be riding those shifts in momentum. I think what first pinged me was the fact that Martha was so nonchalant about sheeping Cass onto the gameplay wagon (their words not mine, see below). It didn't really read to me like they were asserting pressure onto gameplay - they just wanted to wagon. Note that she doesn't really say anything about Cass's alignment before being very happy to sheep.

The central points that I received were that Naomi-Tan is afraid of being lynched, plays uncertainly, and engages in LAMIST behavior to avoid a lynch.

Ryan&#8217;s questions about sheeping, jumping onto vote Martha, followed by his response to Martha&#8217;s accusation that he sheeped when he voted for her are giving me a bit of a town read on Ryan. His defenses are pretty collected and simple, he&#8217;s not overreacting. I like what I see on him, and even though I didn&#8217;t agree with Martha about jumping votes it didn&#8217;t really give me a scum read on her.

She doesn't seem coordinated enough for such a tactic. In fact, I find her posts increasingly hard to follow.

Unless you are in fact town, then start scum- hunting instead.<br>\n<br>\nAnd now she's saying l-2 isn't bad, because scum wouldn't quick hammer, in dirct contradiction with her earlier post (on a tablet, so sorry not going to look it up, but it's in my previous post where I vote her).</div></blockquote>\n\"obviously\" you don't have daytalk?<br>\n<br>\nIf you aren't following their posts isn't that kind of a red flag? I feel like that was the case for me, there were so many other things that looked initially scummy like all the deflection re: voting ryan for example, I latched onto the one thing which I'm sure is town. I think the rest is just Martha being automatically flaily and semi-literate.<br>\n<br>\nI ask why it's obvious that you don't have daytalk because that's obviously not the case.<br>\n<br>\nAnd I've always had this theory that whenever someone says something like that (initially meant as in response to when people say \"r u town??\" \"ofc lol\"), it's because they're scum automatically parsing it to \"are you claiming town?\". And they're subconsciously like \"yes, of course i am claiming town!\", and then they leave the \"of course\" behind. But the only time I noticed it the person was actually town. But this seems like a more pure form (since it wasn't in response to a clich&#233; question). So you're probably scum.</div></blockquote>\n\nYeah, that attack is so predictable and makes me see you as scummier. The daytalk thing is a weak thing for me to say, i know this. Because it is only obvious to me and everyone knows that - and I know everyone knows and that I will convince exactly zero people with such a claim, so it's NAI. Latching onto a thing like that is scummy. All it means is that I can't defend myself from a timing question, you do understand that, right? There's nothing useful to say against such an accusation. You can bring it back up if Martha or I ever flips scum.<br>\n<br>\nNot liking Martha's soft claim, but it does sound more like bad town play than lying scum, so, with an annoyed sigh:<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: Martha</span> <br>\n<br>\nThen this seems like a good lynch:<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: RyanK</span> <br>\nAttacking people for the weakest reasons, accusing them of nonsense and things they didn't say, voting in all the safe places without much in the way of reasoning and just not at all looking town.</div></blockquote>\nSorry for so many big quotes, but they&#8217;re really good. This post backs up my town read on Cass. The sync between the two players voting the same honestly just doesn&#8217;t seem serious enough for me to wonder, just because with thirteen people the likelihood of two people making the same three votes in a row is pretty high.

I feel like my read on him is an area of growth for me as I learn more about how to play well. His play style, lack of logic, and seemingly stupid arguments/votes/actions are all making me want to vote him.

Likewise, illogical argumentation could be on both sides, so it should not be a determiner either. I struggle with that though because scum necessarily has to create fallacious arguments arguing against those they know for a fact are innocent. So I&#8217;m just struggling with that. Am I missing something?<br>\n<br>\nBesides playstle, communication, logic, arguments made, associations, and just plain gut feeling which isn&#8217;t reliable, what are you supposed to look for that I am not getting?<br>\n<br>\nCause Ryan just doesn&#8217;t sit well with me but the pressure seems to be coming off of him in the mid 600s.<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8284460#p8284460\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8284460#p8284460\" data-post-id=\"8284460\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 650</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=26364\">Expedience</a> wrote:</cite>Yes, golden<br>\n<br>\nRyan townslipped, and his erratic behavior is NAI.

That feeling that motivates people to LAMIST of not wanting to be suspected or killed off. I think knowing myself I&#8217;m just too overly concerned with that and while I work hard and feel like I do a good job not acting in my self interest over the town&#8217;s, there&#8217;s still that feeling inside that I (and I would think we all) have to ignore when evaluating the game.

The only exception is rb and this is where<br>\nThree comes in - his votes and attention has been strangely concentrated on rb. The most fake and pushed reasons on all of his votes are always on rb.

I feel like my read on him is an area of growth for me as I learn more about how to play well. <div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">His play style, lack of logic, and seemingly stupid arguments/votes/actions are all making me want to vote him</div>. Yet I&#8217;ve seen multiple times where people have said that it&#8217;s stupid to vote Ryan because of lack of logic or because he has a bad play style.

Can y&#8217;all help me understand this?<br>\n<br>\nIf I think about why that may be the case, bad play style could be the case with scum or town, so it shouldn&#8217;t be a determiner in lynches. Likewise, illogical argumentation could be on both sides, so it should not be a determiner either. I struggle with that though because scum necessarily has to create fallacious arguments arguing against those they know for a fact are innocent. So I&#8217;m just struggling with that. Am I missing something?<br>\n<br>\nBesides playstle, communication, logic, arguments made, associations, and just plain gut feeling which isn&#8217;t reliable, what are you supposed to look for that I am not getting?<br>\n<br>\nCause Ryan just doesn&#8217;t sit well with me but the pressure seems to be coming off of him in the mid 600s.</div></blockquote>\n\nMy problem is that I'm not seeing why you're characterizing the underlined as different from the play at the time that you were reading RyanK as Town.

Of all the things he said, his reads on other players besides Naomi gave me flashes of towniness. Whenever he talked about Naomi I just got the feeling that she would be an easy person to deathtunnel - even if that would not lead to an eventual lynch (because she probably would have been defended, by you and me most notably). I could see scum doing that to avoid being associated with a D1 mislynch.<br>\n<br>\nOf the two Glitch seems more like the type to go with the flow. He said he put his vote on Naomi for pressure, which went nowhere, then switched to Ryan when that was the hot new topic in the thread. I read your case on Glitch and while I'm not sure I'm convinced, he doesn't seem to really have interacted with anybody very much. So it's hard to say this is distancing when there's no relationships to contrast it against for him (that would be the more alarming issue for me). Rereading his posts now, he does seem to be laid back in general, but there's a self consciousness to him I can't put my finger on. This is slightly different but still related to when you said he \"felt forced\", but it does tend to bother me.<br>\n<br>\nI thought it was unfair of both of them to be saying Naomi was \"obsessed\" (Glitch's words I think) with her newness and that she kept bringing it up. Imo, the only reason it kept on coming up was that people had a huge problem with post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8271440#p8271440\">7</a> and kept referring to it. That wouldn't have been a fun place to be if she was town, but I thought she was doing a fair job of fielding the suspicion on her.<br>\n<br>\nOf the two, I'm more paranoid of Chuck, but I see more explicit reasons for why we might lynch Glitch.", "time": "Tue Aug 30, 2016 11:44 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=68113&start=925", "forum": "53", "thread": "68113"}

Your theory, as I understand it, seems to be that I should have had a strong reason for a vote. My contention is that I didn't see any strong reasons for my vote (that is, I didn't see anything that was powerfully indicative of alignment on which to base my vote).<br>\nIf you disagree, then could you explain what strong reason you were expecting from me at that stage of the game?<br>\nIf you think that something else is missing, then could you explain what else should I clarify for you?</div></blockquote>\nNo, not really a stronger reason, but definitely more flushed out then what you initially provided. You come off as a player who analyzes a situation thoroughly before taking action(as either alignment) and seem to place a vote on someone not really because you have a strong reason, but mainly because you view the progression of their play and come to a conclusion. This is evident by your reads on both Ryan(<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8280024#p8280024\">485</a>) and Naomi(<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8282048#p8282048\">529</a>). One thing I'm curious about is why you felt you didn't really have to go into an analytical read before placing your vote? One might assume it was a pressure vote, but this was never indicated at any point after the gameplay wagon fell apart. One thing I would ask of you is if you could now give a analysis of gameplay's posts up to this point(similar to your previous ones) and what your feelings are overall from looking at them. Basically, where do you stand on him now?\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8292928#p8292928\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8292928#p8292928\" data-post-id=\"8292928\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 926</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=12\">Chuck</a> wrote:</cite>Saru, what is your past experience with Dierfire?</div></blockquote>\nMost of this is discussed in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8280943#p8280943\">507</a> but overall, my past experiences point to Dierfire having a robotic style of play regardless of his alignment. It gets really hard to read him unless you try looking at the smaller details, as I'm trying to do. His comments on players is just generic Dierfire imo. It's not really indicative of anything. But how he goes about trying to justify those comments makes me feel might be the key to me being able to get a stronger read on him compared to our last game where he was scum and I gave him the benefit of the doubt all the way through to the last day.

{"number": 1053, "id": "8296565", "user": "Dierfire", "user_id": "25388", "content": "As promised, here is my review of gameplay506.<br>\nI think that the main lines of analysis that gameplay506 has offered are cases on rb (perhaps best encapsulated in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8288533#p8288533\">840</a>) and RyanK (distributed throughout numerous posts, but I'll treat <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8287853#p8287853\">762</a> as fairly representative). Secondarily, he has expressed that he is reading Saru, Expedience, and pitoli as Town (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8294654#p8294654\">1016</a>).<br>\n<br>\nI'll look at the RyanK case first. The essence of this case is theoretically sound; Mafia players would love to be able to play as RyanK is (no contiguous thought process, no meaningful effort to actually solve the game beyond single post quotes at a time) if they could do so without being lynched. This bothers me as well, which is why I've been trying to push RyanK away from the current style in favor of one that offers more comprehensive reads that can be analyzed for motivation in greater depth. My read is still that the specific single-post quotes and things that RyanK seems to feel indicate alignment are more likely to come from Town, but it is a feature of that style that my read will be unable to progress on RyanK while it lasts, and it's not implausible to me that a Town player would find that sufficient cause to vote for RyanK--particularly after prompting RyanK for more substantive reads multiple times without success, as gameplay506 has done (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8286059#p8286059\">736</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8287888#p8287888\">770</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8288160#p8288160\">780</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8296284#p8296284\">1050</a>).<br>\nIf gameplay506 is Mafia, this line of attack would most resemble a Mafia player targeting a Town player playing weakly, such that I would not expect RyanK and gameplay506 to both be Mafia.<br>\n<br>\nThe case on rb is not one that moves me. Many items involve associations between RyanK and rb. I feel that the awkward reactions by RyanK to rb early in the game (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8271904#p8271904\">51</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8271940#p8271940\">60</a>) that are cited are far more plausible if RyanK is Mafia and rb is Town than if they are both Mafia (RyanK seems eager to flatter rb, which doesn't seem an obvious interaction between Mafia players). Another item is that rb is taking things out of context or applying ideas inconsistently (claiming to be a likely N1 kill but wanting to explain things D2, reading me as Town now despite having a negative reaction to my first vote). I don't find these items very persuasive, and certainly not persuasive enough to override my reasons for reading rb as Town (initially this was for the way that rb helped move the game out of RVS, but I think that stronger evidence would be the way that rb shows evidence of reading the game over again starting in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8284562#p8284562\">659</a> with some read progression). While I don't agree with the case on rb, I don't feel that anything about it makes gameplay506 likely to be Mafia; it is certainly plausible to me that a Town player, particularly one focused on RyanK, would see rb reading RyanK as Town and gameplay506 as Mafia as a sign of a chainsaw defense.<br>\n<br>\nAs a last note, the Town reads are not greatly detailed but they are mostly consistent. I agree that pitoli is showing evidence of trying to read players, and that Naomi-Tan (now Expedience) seemed to exhibit a Town mindset when actually dealing with the game (and that opening post was NAI). The read on Saru wasn't detailed, so I'll ask about it in a separate post.<br>\n<br>\nOverall, both of the major cases are unpersuasive but do not show any clear evidence that gameplay506 is not trying to read other players. They could easily come from a Town player, but do not seem particularly difficult for a Mafia player to feign. I've no objection to the reads on pitoli and Expedience. Barring something terrible in the Saru read, gameplay506 remains a Null read to me.", "time": "Wed Aug 31, 2016 3:58 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=68113&start=1050", "forum": "53", "thread": "68113"}

It could be just normal Day 1 vibes without too much reason with such little to go on. Or it could be a lack of logical argumentation for favoring golden. Why?<br>\n<br>\nAdditionally, per <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8293707#p8293707\">947</a>, why should we just trust you on this?<br>\n<br>\nDierfire - seems town enough to me to not be on the radar at the moment. His posts throughout the entire thread are consistent and seem to be genuine, at least from what I&#8217;ve looked at.<br>\n<br>\nGameplay - Pretty stuck up and gets on my nerves. He&#8217;s stuck to Ryan from early in the game and really lobbied against him the whole time. I don&#8217;t really get why he&#8217;s so stuck and set on getting him lynched, however, it seems like it&#8217;s too stupid of a move to stay so hard-core against Ryan if he&#8217;s scum because scum would know better than to draw that much attention, right? I&#8217;m not really scum reading him just because he would be too stupid to be scum this way and I feel like he would play smarter.<br>\n<br>\nMartha - Her whole episode of being down with her own lynch is just weird to me. Why would town be happy about themselves getting lynched? It doesn&#8217;t help anything unless their death is one of the notoriously awful info lynches. (-_-) And apparently since it&#8217;s so well known that that&#8217;s only something a shit player would do, I don&#8217;t see how the whole excitement over getting lynched could be townish.<br>\n<br>\nThen there&#8217;s the fact that she repeatedly reiterates how town she is and throws in a soft claim. I just don&#8217;t like it. Plus, she&#8217;s on the Ryan wagon which I think even though there&#8217;s 5 votes on it right now I get the feeling it&#8217;s over because we&#8217;ve gotten what we need out of it and I think there&#8217;s enough people satisfied with his reaction that we won&#8217;t reach a lynch.<br>\n<br>\nBefore putting her as a scum read, one note.

Helps with PoE and town hunting is a thing. Also thought predecessor was town, so that helps. Don't like recent posts however with the whole \"absolute\" reads on people like Ryan. The way she calls Ryan a mislynch feels like she's too sure of herself. Difference between being confident and being absolute. Absoluteness is not really the hallmark of a mafia game, at-least not before a flip. Strong town read. <br>\n<br>\nMartha - Was hard to read. Still is. Some of her votes seem OMGUS near the start but feels like she's trying to put in authentic effort towards reading people in her more recent posts, and I liked the effort put into analyzing the play of rb/Ryan. Don't know what to make of the soft-claim, but it felt genuine. Very slight town lean.<br>\n<br>\nRyan - Mostly talked about in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8289684#p8289684\">884</a>. Wouldn't cry over a lynch on him because he's shown no real sign of improvement from what was discussed, but I'm hoping he'll step up sooner than later to help me form a more coherent read on him besides just WIFOM reasoning. Null.<br>\n<br>\ngameplay - Almost all of his posts focus on either Ryan or rb. Can't read him on anything else. Don't see the point in this incessant tunnel if he's town, but also don't see what he achieves as scum. Again, not a fan of the \"absolute\" style reads. His frustration towards Ryan is understandable and does feel genuine. Still need more posts from him that don't include either Ryan or rb. Null until more diverse content can be parsed from.<br>\n<br>\nBBT - Liked the entrance, but did 0 after that. Looks like he might end up being a replace out so I have literally no opinion on him at this point. \n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8296389#p8296389\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8296389#p8296389\" data-post-id=\"8296389\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 1052</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=25388\">Dierfire</a> wrote:</cite><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">@Saru</div><br>\nYou asked me in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8293032#p8293032\">930</a> why I didn't feel a need to \"go into an analytical read\" before I placed my vote on gameplay506.

Your reasoning was just \"X is town therefore Y is more likely to be scum\" which doesn't come off as analyzing but just providing some convoluted statistical reasoning. I think the first 130 posts were more than informative and were more than fertile ground for analysis(which again, seems to be your strong point), at-least enough for you to either give a more compelling reason to vote or to hold off from voting altogether.

As I was able to read rb as Town with some degree of confidence, I made that the basis of my vote.<br>\nYour description of my style appears to be based on <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&amp;t=66833\" class=\"postlink\">Mini 1800</a>; I had a late entrance in that game such that we had significant game-advancing content by the time that I arrived. My initial vote in that game is more typical of my \"third vote\" in a game that starts in RVS. My entrance in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=67535\" class=\"postlink\">Mini 1817</a> is a more typical pattern for my \"first vote\" and the one is this game is more like a \"second vote\" pattern (compare to my second vote in Mini 1817; compare all three to votes in previous games--one good example in which I actually got all three votes in during the same game is <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=50&amp;t=66650\" class=\"postlink\">Newbie 1712</a>).</div></blockquote>\nAh, now I see what you're saying. I did a quick ISO of Newbie 1712 and I understand what you mean by the three votes. Essentially, the first vote is always just RVS. Second vote is based on minimal information near or at the end of RVS, and the third vote is usually put out via extensive analysis of things long after RVS is over. So your vote on gameplay here was more second vote than first or third, and so your logic behind it actually matches up nicely with that. Did I understand that correctly? Either way:<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: </span><br>\nI like your explanation and it puts me more at ease about you. Still don't know how to read you but I guess I'll just have to wait and see more from you.<br>\n<br>\nThe Expedience wagon doesn't make any sense to me. Ok, he asked Glitch for a claim, so? Not like he's automatically forced to give one. I also don't think scum just outright asks for a claim like that. I don't however understand what the purpose of a \"claim duel\" is, and I've actually never even heard of such a thing lol.<br>\n<br>\nI also didn't have much of a read on Glitch, but I do agree with Dierfire and Expedience that his tone towards Chuck when it comes to reading him seems very odd and comes off as distancing. Dierfire sums it up pretty well with this:\n<blockquote><div><cite>Dierfire wrote:</cite>You both expressed suspicion of her, so it was unclear why you felt that Chuck was suspicious given his focus on Naomi-Tan. It's the sort of thing that comes up when a Mafia player is cooperating with a partner while trying to create distance.</div></blockquote>\nI also thought that Expedience made a compelling point in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8299709#p8299709\">1126</a> against Glitch. I'm curious to see what he has to say about that. <br>\n<br>\n@Expedience: I know you said you didn't want to reveal too much, but can you give atleast some idea as to what you seek to accomplish from a \"claim duel\"?

I did a quick ISO of Newbie 1712 and I understand what you mean by the three votes. Essentially, the first vote is always just RVS. Second vote is based on minimal information near or at the end of RVS, and the third vote is usually put out via extensive analysis of things long after RVS is over. So your vote on gameplay here was more second vote than first or third, and so your logic behind it actually matches up nicely with that. Did I understand that correctly? Either way:<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: </span><br>\nI like your explanation and it puts me more at ease about you. Still don't know how to read you but I guess I'll just have to wait and see more from you.<br>\n<br>\nThe Expedience wagon doesn't make any sense to me. Ok, he asked Glitch for a claim, so? Not like he's automatically forced to give one. I also don't think scum just outright asks for a claim like that. I don't however understand what the purpose of a \"claim duel\" is, and I've actually never even heard of such a thing lol.<br>\n<br>\nI also didn't have much of a read on Glitch, but I do agree with Dierfire and Expedience that his tone towards Chuck when it comes to reading him seems very odd and comes off as distancing. Dierfire sums it up pretty well with this:\n<blockquote><div><cite>Dierfire wrote:</cite>You both expressed suspicion of her, so it was unclear why you felt that Chuck was suspicious given his focus on Naomi-Tan. It's the sort of thing that comes up when a Mafia player is cooperating with a partner while trying to create distance.</div></blockquote>\nI also thought that Expedience made a compelling point in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8299709#p8299709\">1126</a> against Glitch. I'm curious to see what he has to say about that. <br>\n<br>\n@Expedience: I know you said you didn't want to reveal too much, but can you give atleast some idea as to what you seek to accomplish from a \"claim duel\"? It seems like you want Glitch's lynch no matter what, so why does claiming make a difference for you?</div></blockquote>\nIt makes a difference because it will get other people to vote him.<br>\n<br>\nIf two people enter a CLAIM DUEL, only one survives.

You only read early game. I like to join wagons for pressure in early game, because it gets things moving and creates interesting patterns and reads. Logically, that means joining 'majorities', not really majorities obviously... That would be lynching. But blocks, others sheeping vocal players, semi- decent cases... Anyhing goes in that phase of the game. Why is that scummy? I'm not hiding, I'm not quick-lynching, I give you patterns to analyze.

Martha defends against my case and her and me get into a fight that's mostly misunderstandings and language-issues, I think (it's pretty unreadable, I apologize for my part in that).

Expedience attacks Martha and defends Ryan. Based on this - I think because he's somehow reassured that Expedience is town (<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">unlike me</div>) -, rb revotes Martha(<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8281071#p8281071\">523</a>.<br>\n(<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Off topic: Post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8282001#p8282001\">528</a> makes me wonder if I could be wrong about gameplay; could he be Expedience's partner?</div>)<br>\nNow Martha says she can't defend herself because there are 'scums' on her wagon (wagon is now (4): Cass, pitoli, Expedience, rb).

I feel like this post is expecting Glitch to flip town because it only overs scenarios where this is the case. like he starts with \"if he flips town\" then devolves into outright assumption<br>\n<br>\nIt's unreasonable for town!Chuck to presume a town flip here, his post where he realized he wa hammered actually looked like a scumclaim to me (since it showed his aim was survival (however his play before that was pretty town and made my heart sink reading it)). Chuck never took a stance on Glitch, just let it happen and then tried to set up new pushes afterwards, but he did it slightly too prematurely.<br>\n<br>\nThe CLAIM DUEL thing is something that happened a while ago, Glitch didn't really bring anything revelatory to light there. Chuck could've made his own evaluation of the CLAIM DUEL when he made that post about how oddly interested he was in the claims of two town members. This is a really unnatural progression and shows that he didn't really believe all the crap he was throwing at me before. All the suspicion on me is completely gone! It's probably because he mistakenly thought I was a PR (and didn't notice that Martha was one?).<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Chuck</span>", "time": "Thu Sep 08, 2016 11:12 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=68113&start=1400", "forum": "53", "thread": "68113"}

You either scum hunt or you don't. You don't catch scum by being passive about it, because then scum can be just as nonchalant and get away with it. Do you town read Dier on anything besides his \"passive\" involvement, because your current read on him seems forced.<br>\n<br>\nMy current lynch pool is (Ryan, Golden, Dier). I'm waiting to see if Ryan explains the whole thing about his \"attitude\" change he promised from D1. As it stands right now, he's really not done much except play up the VI card. The golden slot still reads scummy to me because he never fully explained his sheep vote with me on Dierfire, and actually, looking back, he never answered one of my more recent questions towards him on D1. That, and he just has a bunch of one-liners that don't say too much. Dier is a lot more null than scum, but I wouldn't be upset if he were lynched, only because I'm selfish and I can't figure him out and I still remain paranoid. <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\">", "time": "Fri Sep 09, 2016 3:10 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=68113&start=1450", "forum": "53", "thread": "68113"}

Because the three biggest wagons yesterday were on Ryan, Glitch, and Martha, and both of those other two flipped town. And the Glitch wagon was like a last minute Hail Mary play to get the wagon off of Ryan.<br>\n<br>\nI think either Expedience and Ryan are scum together or Expedience is scum by himself, setting up Ryan to take the fall because he knew Glitch was an easy wagon and he also knew how bad that would look on Ryan. And the Martha power role flip was just icing on the cake. Also, Expedience knew Martha suspected him, so getting rid of her would be a good play for that reason too. And finally, he knew I suspected Martha, so getting rid of her also makes me look bad.<br>\n<br>\nLooking into Expedience-RyanK interactions but I would not be surprised if it's Expedience just setting up a townie.<br>\n<br>\nNeedless to say, I completely take back what I said yesterday about agreeing with Glitch about Expedience seeming more townie due to his push on Glitch. I think that was just wishful thinking on Glitch's part.<br>\n<br>\nAlso to defend against my wagon, the claims are blown way out of proportion, as it was a passing comment about \"if he flips town\" and as we should all know, or at least most of us, last-minute wagon swings are very rarely on scum; additionally, Glitch had made some really townie looking posts.<br>\n<br>\nIt seems Expedience thinks killing me would obviously legitimize my suspicions of him, and he has concluded that it's more prudent to try to assassinate my character during the day phase and hope for a mislynch.

You indicated in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8316891#p8316891\">1409</a> that there was no way a town!Chuck could have possibly thought that Glitch's post before him was town, because you thought it was a scum claim(but now you're saying it was genuine). However, did you ever stop to think that Chuck never thought Glitch was town because of his hammer post? Go read <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8307639#p8307639\">1364</a> again. Chuck clearly indicates he thinks the wagon on Glitch was a wagon on town because of the swing and the fact that it was built-up quickly while Glitch was gone. At no point did Chuck ever say he thought <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8307611#p8307611\">1363</a> was genuine or a town claim. This is what YOU said he thought, not what he actually thought. His <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8319748#p8319748\">1470</a> indicates this even further.<br>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Not really, I think you're reading too much into that.

I can also make up my own story as to how what Chuck did has town motivation just as easily, but guess what, that's not a real argument, that's just a counter-punch.

Let's see: you admit that you have MORE reasons other than the ones initially stated to be town reading Dier(but you never give them), but you also agree that your words \"passive involvement\" is an oxymoron(which was your only reason stated to be town reading Dier), yet you still have Dier as a gut town read instead of null? Why are you town reading Dier for something you admit is BS and also something you admit is null at best.

My goal with Dier was to get to understand him better because I can never read him. It wasn't an overreaction more than it was something to see if I could place him either way, which I didn't succeed in, which is why I stopped trying. I would have to disagree that my push onto Dier didn't allow me to interact outside of that or be a catalyst for interaction. I had questions for golden about his weak sheep of me onto Dier, which he neglected to keep answering after a while, as well as general questions that help me sort people into reads. I'm not going to be a catalyst for interaction just for the sake of it, if that's what you mean. If I feel something is suspicious or I'm confused about it, I will investigate further with questioning and a back-and-forth discussion(i.e. Dierfire). I'm not going to be like Ryan and just throw out questions to force/fake activity, which is what scum tends to do. <br>\n<br>\nYou also say in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8319541#p8319541\">1467</a> that my posts fit the lurker-scum persona better than Dierfire, but the definition you gave for lurker-scum is exactly what Dier has been doing as well, but I'm supposedly a better lynch?

To be fair, it's something that comes out of PoE because I have lots of town/null-town reads, so I don't necessarily think that (Ryan, Golden, Dier) is the scum team; this is very unlikely, but I'm working within my reads at the moment. If they change, my lynch pool will also change.<br>\n<br>\nI would also have to disagree that Ryan or Dier have been lurkers. As rb stated, Ryan is around to answer questions pretty much 24/7(at-least he was on D1) and so I don't see how Ryan would never be around to defend himself. And as previously stated, Dier is someone who tries to come in once a day and comb through the game and gives updated reads and answer questions. He's not a lurker.

And no, he hasn't really \"pushed\" on 3 people. He voted gameplay because something about statistics and then he pressured golden and then voted Glitch because it was the more useful wagon after golden fell off the face of the earth. 2 of those aren't really what I'd call \"pushes.\" FWIW, I think his reasons for voting golden and Glitch were solid.<br>\n<br>\nThe point isn't Dier here though.

I also think that some of his points about Ryan are valid and I'm also confused why Ryan is being shrugged off as \"too stupid to be scum.\" Cass is still a moderate town read because she's been consistent in the usage of her vote for pressure on D1, which she has stated time and time again is what she does it for. I am curious to see how she intends to use her vote now since it is D2, since voting for pressure starts to lose its luster after a while. golden is the only one I'd consider lynching today in that pool. So, yes, I mostly disagree.\n<blockquote><div><cite>rb wrote:</cite>Chuck is like honorary member but I think he's a bad lynch today.</div></blockquote>\nDefine \"honorary.\" I'm assuming he is more of a PoE addition because you have lots of town reads?\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8324206#p8324206\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8324206#p8324206\" data-post-id=\"8324206\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 1529</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=28086\">rb</a> wrote:</cite>Or maybe he's good, I dunno.

No matter how dumb or scummy you think I might be, there are other words you can use to express this feeling that don't try to hit below the belt. If you don't have these words in your repertoire, then go pick up a dictionary and find them, because I can assure you that no one will want to play with you if you keep spouting personal expletives at people.<br>\n<br>\nAnd it's rich that you would accuse me of trying to goad you into being uncooperative, when I was trying to have a cooperative conversation with you. You decided that no, you'd rather veer off that and force my hand. If anything, it would be you who would be goading me into being toxic. What do you expect for someone to do when they're being called personal insults? Sit back and take it? No. Obviously they're going to get upset and talk back in some kind of way. I'm pretty sure you'd know this, seeing as you do the same thing with others.

You said you felt that out of those two, rb was just more likely town from a pure statistical standpoint(correct me if I'm wrong). I'd argue(and have) that using statistics to present a town read to someone(especially in the very early game) doesn't make much sense and just feels weak overall.<br>\n<br>\nHowever, you went on to elaborate in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8273739#p8273739\">168</a> that it was rb's initiative to break out of RVS so quickly that made you feel he was trying to help town rather than hurt it and I'm assuming that was your secondary(?) reasoning for town reading him. I also felt the same way, however, you seem confident that, that one act of initiative from rb is enough for you to keep town reading him up to this point. If this is true, why? And if not, what has rb done besides that, that makes you strongly town read him?\n<blockquote><div><cite>Dierfire wrote:</cite>that my vote was based on D1 reasons--to which I'd respond that golden009 hasn't given me any D2 updates!</div></blockquote>\nI get that, but it seriously doesn't bother you that a wagon formed on a slot which was empty up to this point in D2? You've made some accusations against that slot during D1, but you don't care to actually see a response from it? How confident are you that the slot will flip scum?\n<blockquote><div><cite>Dierfire wrote:</cite>that I was \"throwing shade\" at you--to which I'd respond that asking you for a vote is a pretty reasonable request when I'm trying to read you, and doesn't really hold water as an example of \"throwing shade\" (I will state very clearly when I am suspicious of another player)</div></blockquote>\nOk.

Because the three biggest wagons yesterday were on Ryan, Glitch, and Martha, and both of those other two flipped town. And the Glitch wagon was like a last minute Hail Mary play to get the wagon off of Ryan.<br>\n<br>\nI think either Expedience and Ryan are scum together or Expedience is scum by himself, setting up Ryan to take the fall because he knew Glitch was an easy wagon and he also knew how bad that would look on Ryan. And the Martha power role flip was just icing on the cake. Also, Expedience knew Martha suspected him, so getting rid of her would be a good play for that reason too. And finally, he knew I suspected Martha, so getting rid of her also makes me look bad.<br>\n<br>\nLooking into Expedience-RyanK interactions but I would not be surprised if it's Expedience just setting up a townie.<br>\n<br>\nNeedless to say, I completely take back what I said yesterday about agreeing with Glitch about Expedience seeming more townie due to his push on Glitch. I think that was just wishful thinking on Glitch's part.<br>\n<br>\nAlso to defend against my wagon, the claims are blown way out of proportion, as it was a passing comment about \"if he flips town\" and as we should all know, or at least most of us, last-minute wagon swings are very rarely on scum; additionally, Glitch had made some really townie looking posts.<br>\n<br>\nIt seems Expedience thinks killing me would obviously legitimize my suspicions of him, and he has concluded that it's more prudent to try to assassinate my character during the day phase and hope for a mislynch.

We were on Dierfire, then he made a decent post, then I made a case on martha (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8280477#p8280477\">489</a>), Pitoli &amp; Golden vaguely sheeped me but without voting. Martha defends against my case and her and me get into a fight that's mostly misunderstandings and language-issues, I think (it's pretty unreadable, I apologize for my part in that). Then Pitoli (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8280865#p8280865\">497</a>) notes that Martha's and my posts 'synch up', and we could be following eachother onto wagons. (Note when ISO-ing: Martha here increases the confusion by posting a few times with and ALT account, keyenpeydee.) <br>\nNow Pitoli votes Martha, and Martha votes Ryan. Rb likes Dierfire's post and joins the Martha wagon, starts pushing it, as does Pitoli. Now Expedience (replaced Naomi) joins the wagon, but still thinks Dierfire is scum too. (<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\"><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8280968#p8280968\">509</a> - This one reinforces my scumread on Expedience.</div>) Rb feels the wagon is going too fast now, too easy (<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">I can see what he means...</div>) and unvotes Martha (also calls Saru, Pitoli and Golden town). Expedience attacks Martha and defends Ryan. Based on this - I think because he's somehow reassured that Expedience is town (<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">unlike me</div>) -, rb revotes Martha(<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8281071#p8281071\">523</a>.<br>\n(<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Off topic: Post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8282001#p8282001\">528</a> makes me wonder if I could be wrong about gameplay; could he be Expedience's partner?</div>)<br>\nNow Martha says she can't defend herself because there are 'scums' on her wagon (wagon is now (4): Cass, pitoli, Expedience, rb). Martha starts to panic, suggests self-hammering, calls her own wagon good, etc. Now Ryan joins the wagon (<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">can't blame him, really</div>), making it L-2.<br>\n<br>\nWe are now at 550 (the second vote-count). What happens right after this is also interesting. The wagon weakens, as Ryan and Expedience back off. (<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Omg, expedience looks so scummy doing that.</div>)<br>\nThen in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8282506#p8282506\">578</a> with just 3 votes on her, Martha soft-claims (maybe explaining the earlier panic?).

The initial vote for me in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8273995#p8273995\">189</a> on the basis that my early vote was weaker than my votes in previous games was fairly thoughtless.

In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8325237#p8325237\">1568</a> Saru is inordinately suspicious of my <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8324472#p8324472\">1557</a>--although some of this is attributable to the usual misunderstandings, the accusation that my read on rb is a result of rb reading me as Town during their recent argument (having spent a good portion of the game focused on my entrance and the read on rb as Town within), reads to me like an attempt to fake suspicion.<br>\n<br>\nSaru expresses suspicion of golden009 for following his vote on me. Given that Saru was recently thinking that I should have liked my vote less when more players joined it, it's possible that this represents the theoretical way that Saru approaches the game.<br>\n<br>\nObviously I disagree with the suspicion of RyanK, but as I've elaborated at length, I think that it's reasonable for a Town player to be suspicious of RyanK, so I can't say that it makes Saru especially likely to be Mafia.<br>\n<br>\nWhen rb mentions Saru (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8322192#p8322192\">1514</a> says that Saru is either Town or lurking Mafia), Saru calls this a contradiction. This is also a fairly bad line of reasoning, for reasons that have been elaborated already (rb had other reasons to read me as Town, my activity was appreciably higher than Saru's even when taking into account the fact that Saru makes larger single posts while I make multiple shorter posts, rb didn't say that Saru was lurking Mafia), but seems to have cleared up since.<br>\n<br>\nOverall, I've been disagreeing with most everything of consequence that Saru has said (although this is easy as most of his attention has fallen on me and rb, whom I'm reading as Town). In attempting to distinguish the source of disagreement, I'm unable to find strong evidence that Saru's posts are coming from a Mafia perspective.

No. This is a terrible mis-rep of what I was saying. Actually, it's not AT ALL what I said. Quote for me where I said that I thought you were town reading rb because he was town reading you. I didn't. Don't put words in my mouth. Your town read of rb seemed to come from D1 only, and the fact that you love it when people go back and re-evaluate their reads, it didn't match up to me that you'd leave a strong town read as it were from just early D1 reasoning. Now that you made it clear that, that wasn't your only reasoning(after I prompted you about it), it makes more sense. <br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Dierfire wrote:</cite>When rb mentions Saru (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8322192#p8322192\">1514</a> says that Saru is either Town or lurking Mafia), Saru calls this a contradiction. This is also a fairly bad line of reasoning, for reasons that have been elaborated already (rb had other reasons to read me as Town, my activity was appreciably higher than Saru's even when taking into account the fact that Saru makes larger single posts while I make multiple shorter posts, rb didn't say that Saru was lurking Mafia), but seems to have cleared up since.</div></blockquote>\nIT IS a contradiction because your activity was NOT much more higher than mine. \"Appreciable?\" LMFAO! You came in once a day and gave reads and answers to questions like you always do. I came in and gave reads and answers to questions from multiple days at one time, which is why I had walls going. There's no real difference there, except that I had to spread myself out more due to RL as I stated previously. The funny part is, you haven't even been responding to people in real-time. I had done this with rb. This makes it so easy for coasting scum such as yourself to come up with what you're going to say next to someone who might be scum reading you.<br>\n<br>\nAnd even if you can make the argument that your post count was higher than mine, you'd be missing the whole point of my argument with rb which was that it wasn't about raw post count, but of the content within those posts that rb seemed to take issue with initially. According to him, I was coming in and giving thoughtful posts and then just bowing out. I contended that you've done the same exact thing, but apparently that point went out the window for....reasons?? Yeah...no. That argument has still not been \"cleared up,\" as I still take issue with that contradiction. I just decided to leave it behind because I see rb as town right now, and getting into wall wars with town is what I did in Mini 1800, and that didn't end well for me.\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8333695#p8333695\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8333695#p8333695\" data-post-id=\"8333695\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 1827</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=12\">Chuck</a> wrote:</cite>Saru, Dierfire, pitoli, and Cass, what do you think about:<br>\n<br>\n1.

One thing I noticed from Mini 1800, was that it seemed like an inherent part of Math's scum game to be using people to their advantage. Basically, talking to or questioning people in a way to get them to do their bidding for them. I don't see that from Math here at all. They seem so much more genuine about things in general, and it doesn't seem like they're trying to mislead people.<br>\n2. This is just rb being rb. As for BBT, I don't get why he doesn't want to explain things. I understand that he's done this before as town, but I'm not entirely sure what his reasoning is here. He needs to start explaining. I walk away from that argument as still rb town and BBT null scum. <br>\n3. Expedience is town. Your argument against him makes 0 sense to me. Yes, his choice to vote you right off the bat(with false reasoning) looks bad, but not scummy. The reason it isn't scummy is because after I pointed out that what he was saying about you wasn't true, he reconsidered and voted elsewhere. That wasn't a \"scum-claim\" as you called it.

Perhaps it would help if I offered some clarification. First, this \"style\" makes it more difficult for me to read BBT, so I don't think that it's accurate to characterize my position as \"condemning him because I don't like his style\" here. The reason that I don't like his style is because it makes it difficult for me to assess his alignment; the reason that I'd prefer lynching him over rb is that I'm reading rb as Town and can more easily base that read on concrete things. As an additional illustration of the difference, I also don't like the \"style\" that RyanK was using, but I have some concrete reasons to read RyanK as Town.<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8336811#p8336811\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8336811#p8336811\" data-post-id=\"8336811\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 1981</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=24641\">House</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8335328#p8335328\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8335328#p8335328\" data-post-id=\"8335328\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 1856</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=25388\">Dierfire</a> wrote:</cite><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">@House</div><br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8335140#p8335140\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8335140#p8335140\" data-post-id=\"8335140\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 1835</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=24641\">House</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8284572#p8284572\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8284572#p8284572\" data-post-id=\"8284572\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 662</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=25388\">Dierfire</a> wrote:</cite>(one mentioned example, expressing suspicion of Naomi-Tan in 88 for mentioning Daytalk, works well as an illustration of what I mean--I would expect a Mafia player to actually check how Naomi-Tan knew this information before making the vote).</div></blockquote>\n\nWhy would a newbie mafia ask town how they knew the information when they already know that town can't know it except by the op since that player is not scum?<br>\n<br>\nExperienced scum might be more likely to ask, in order to cover their own ass, but newbscum are more prone to tripping up on their own knowledge.</div></blockquote>\n\nThat's my point precisely!

Since when did town!Dierfire hide reasoning like this? This pings me hard.</div></blockquote>\n\nHere is my line of reasoning. Martha had hinted at having a role in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8282506#p8282506\">578</a>, and the Mafia players were evidently aware of this (as they killed her N1). In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8282846#p8282846\">614</a> golden009 casts a vote for Martha (vote was on me before that). This is after the wagon on Martha largely dissolved, so why is golden009 moving his vote? He didn't have much of a chance of lynching Martha. He didn't need to move his vote to have it parked on someone who wouldn't have been lynched (the existing vote on me would have fulfilled that purpose). He didn't really need to worry that a vote on me would attract a tremendous amount of suspicion. Therefore, I'm having difficulty seeing why the vote moved if golden009 is a Mafia player with access to Daytalk (the Traitor role crossed my mind, but I think that a Traitor in MathBlade's position would most likely not claim VT).<br>\nYou seem to be wondering why I didn't present this immediately. The thought first occurred to me after I directed MathBlade to look at the events surrounding <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8282506#p8282506\">578</a>, but I still wanted to hear what MathBlade thought. Since you object, I'll share this at the risk of introducing bias into her analysis.<br>\nYou also seem to be asking me for prior games in which I took a similar approach. I will provide one link that occurs to me now: in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8042452#p8042452\" class=\"postlink\">Newbie 1719</a> I was (incorrectly) reading Ghubster as Town while still wanting him to answer questions posed by another player.", "time": "Sat Sep 17, 2016 2:25 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=68113&start=2050", "forum": "53", "thread": "68113"}

Sounds like to me you were beyond sure that, that slot would have flipped scum. But then, when the replacement for it does come in, you end up just unvoting and then never providing actual scum reads or an actual vote. Your thought process with the golden slot has been utterly inconsistent. It's actually so blatant that I'm surprised I'm the only one noticing it.<br>\n<br>\nAnd as to the quote that you posted, no, it's not me saying you town read rb because he town reads you. My point was that since you didn't respond to an argument that had your name come up so much(which is really not like you), it felt like you were giving a silent nod to rb's arguments against me. You prove this to me when you come back with the same exact stuff that rb said about me after I prompted you for a comment. Almost word for word.\n<blockquote><div><cite>Dierfire wrote:</cite>Here is my line of reasoning. Martha had hinted at having a role in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8282506#p8282506\">578</a>, and the Mafia players were evidently aware of this (as they killed her N1). In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8282846#p8282846\">614</a> golden009 casts a vote for Martha (vote was on me before that). This is after the wagon on Martha largely dissolved, so why is golden009 moving his vote? He didn't have much of a chance of lynching Martha. He didn't need to move his vote to have it parked on someone who wouldn't have been lynched (the existing vote on me would have fulfilled that purpose). He didn't really need to worry that a vote on me would attract a tremendous amount of suspicion. Therefore, I'm having difficulty seeing why the vote moved if golden009 is a Mafia player with access to Daytalk (the Traitor role crossed my mind, but I think that a Traitor in MathBlade's position would most likely not claim VT).</div></blockquote>\nWait. So you couldn't have thought of this before-hand? Meaning, you scum read golden from D1, but all these actions you JUST described are ALL from D1. Like...what? This just sounds like an excuse to hop off the wagon on a slot whose replacement isn't one to go down so easily.

He didn't need to move his vote to have it parked on someone who wouldn't have been lynched (the existing vote on me would have fulfilled that purpose). He didn't really need to worry that a vote on me would attract a tremendous amount of suspicion.

In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8282846#p8282846\">614</a> golden009 casts a vote for Martha (vote was on me before that). This is after the wagon on Martha largely dissolved, so why is golden009 moving his vote? He didn't have much of a chance of lynching Martha. He didn't need to move his vote to have it parked on someone who wouldn't have been lynched (the existing vote on me would have fulfilled that purpose). He didn't really need to worry that a vote on me would attract a tremendous amount of suspicion.

So you couldn't have thought of this before-hand? Meaning, you scum read golden from D1, but all these actions you JUST described are ALL from D1. Like...what? This just sounds like an excuse to hop off the wagon on a slot whose replacement isn't one to go down so easily.

Which of them looked like they required a response from golden009? Also, as I have multiple players expressing suspicion of me, the underlined (my addition) feels...exaggerated to me.</div></blockquote>\nWhether it required a response or not really isn't the point. The point is that you sat on an empty slot's wagon(showing a commitment to your scum read on it) but as soon as it gets filled, you make for the hills. Rhyme not intended. It shows that you weren't very confident that golden was scum from the start, but the way you pushed him sure gave off the aura that you were. Also, the part that you underlined isn't exaggeration. I was talking about your waffle on golden and no one had pointed it out at the time but myself.<br>\n<br>\nAlso, you're now voting Cass, and so I'm surprised that having Cass as your second scum suspect, you'd choose not to vote her instead around the time that you voted golden. Like, golden wasn't around and was being replaced, but Cass was very much around to answer questions. Why didn't you have a discussion with Cass on some of things you felt off about with her instead of just sitting on the wagon of an empty slot? That right there is the coasting scum that I'm talking about and that you've played to, to a T. You don't care to have a real discussion with one of your scum reads because you can just sit back and watch an empty one get insta-lynched. No effort required on your part. \n<blockquote><div><cite>Dierfire wrote:</cite>You are saying that you were worried that I was agreeing with rb more than with you?

It was right after the argument with rb and you re-affirmed that rb was in your town list. When you put the two together, it felt like you were buddying up to rb. You said it wasn't shade and I guess it wasn't.

And it's even funnier how you treated him all of D1. You scum read him hardcore like the first few minutes, but then you vote someone else, and then after a \"re-read\" you go back to voting gameplay. By the time you re-voted him, his wagon was long gone. You unvoted him at something like L-2 or L-1 and then re-voted when he was in no danger of ever being lynched again. You two fought each other all day to fake activity and to create distancing. And lo and behold, it worked! <br>\n<br>\nDon't accuse me of \"flailing\" when you vote me only after I point all this out. You don't actually think I'm scum.

Time to back up your words Math.</div></blockquote>\nSee the funny thing is, that was your exact plan. Of course gameplay wasn't going to be speed lynched like 10 mins into D1. And it's even funnier how you treated him all of D1. You scum read him hardcore like the first few minutes, but then you vote someone else, and then after a \"re-read\" you go back to voting gameplay. By the time you re-voted him, his wagon was long gone. You unvoted him at something like L-2 or L-1 and then re-voted when he was in no danger of ever being lynched again. You two fought each other all day to fake activity and to create distancing. And lo and behold, it worked! <br>\n<br>\nDon't accuse me of \"flailing\" when you vote me only after I point all this out. You don't actually think I'm scum. You never really did. <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol2.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"Laughing\"></div></blockquote>\n\nRegardless of your alignment I feel like I'm losing IQ points just reading these words.", "time": "Tue Sep 27, 2016 1:16 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=68113&start=2600", "forum": "53", "thread": "68113"}

I actually agree that you (generally) have bad reads Accountant...but I agree you're not at all a bad player because of those other reasons. I think it's really more that I should just do what SpyreX suggested and feel the murderlust <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol2.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"Laughing\"><br>\n<br>\nI was just really tired of being dead right about scumteams and dying early then watching the town not lynch the obvious scumslots, so I acted scummy to present myself as a viable mislynch (knowing that I wouldn't really get mislynched) and prevent scum from NK'ing me. It made the game frustrating because people couldn't understand that it was very deliberate even after I explained it and even after gameplay's slot flipped scum - which should have been very obvious that I was town (like seriously) afterwards. <br>\n<br>\nSo it's as much my own fault for putting myself in the situation of being the accurate scumreads but not being able to convince people, so I probably won't play like that next time. I'll instead just put my vote where I'm 99% sure will hit scum and let the rest of the town do the rest. But that can be insanely frustrating too, as you saw with Vecna in Rocks - he picked the scum, got lynched and then still no one paid attention to why he was hated in the town. Seeing that from a scum perspective made me not want to be that guy, I could basically just feel Vecna seething from that. But hey, I think it's better to just be dead and less invested in the outcome than to have to fight through to LyLo as a slot under pressure.
