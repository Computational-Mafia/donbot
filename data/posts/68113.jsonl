Don't rules-lawyer.<br>1. All <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=6470\" class=\"postlink\">site-wide rules</a> apply.<br>2. Don't quote private Moderator-information, even if it's not real. You can paraphrase if you want.<br>3. Please don't communicate privately with each other unless your role PM says you can or you're a mafia member.<br>4. Please be active. As a general guideline, one post every 48 hours is the bare minimum.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Night Actions</span><br>1. Submit all night actions by the deadline or I will assume you don't want to make any actions.<br>2. If you don't want to make any actions, PM \"No Action\" to me. <br>3. For the mafia, the latest post with a decision to kill that is <span class=\"noboldsig\">bolded</span> will be the final kill order. Remember to specify who is making the kill.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Voting, Deadlines and Death</span><br>1. You can lynch a player by getting more than half the surviving players to vote them.<br>2. Once a majority happens you can't unvote.<br>3. Everyone including the lynched player can continue posting until I post the flip.<br>4. I won't count a vote unless it's clear who you're voting for.<br>5. <span class=\"noboldsig\">Use the vote/unvote tag to vote or unvote. I will not count votes or unvotes not in vote/unvote tags.</span><br>6. You can also vote No Lynch if you want.<br>7. I will post a vote count regularly.<br>8. Each game day will last two weeks. There will be no extensions of the deadline. <br>9. Each game night will last two days. There will be no extensions or shortening of the deadline.<br>10. When players die, they can't post any more. At all. There are no exceptions.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Activity</span><br>1. If you have not posted in 48 hours, I will see if you have any prods. If you do, I will replace you. If you don't I will prod you.<br>2. If you do not respond to a prod within 24 hours, I will replace you.<br>3. I may replace players at any time if I see they are just posting to avoid prods and are not really playing the game.<br>4. If you are not going to be able to play for large amounts of time, consider replacing out. To be honest, I don't really like players who go V/LA for long periods of time without replacing out. <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Miscellaneous</span><br>1. Don't be an asshole to people. If you don't know what this rule means, either look at General Game Rule 0 or replace out. <br>2. Red color is my color. Please don't make posts with this color.<br>3. Do not use small text, invisible text, cryptography or other weird posting tricks. <br>4. If you want to make a public request to me(for example asking for a prod on someone), bold it so I won't miss it. <br>5. If you want to make a private request to me, PM me.<br>6. Mafia members can talk during the day.<br>7. There are 10 town members and 3 mafia members. No third parties or additional factions.<br>8. If you break any of these rules, I will kill you. <br>Vanilla Townie Role PM:</span></span><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>You are a <span style=\"color: green\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Vanilla Townie</span></span><br><br>Abilities: <br>You have no abilities.<br><br>Win Condition:<br>You win when all threats to the town are eliminated and there is at least one town player alive.<br><br>Game Thread:<br>The game thread is here: [ ]<br></div></blockquote>"}

I guess I better start.. Hello everyone I'm Naomi, and I tend to play unsure of things and have a weird mind set. As town and scum I fear being lynched, which means I tend to do lots of LAMIST stuff. I never am too sure on my own thoughts but I try my best even if thats not so good. I tend to do shorter posts with a summery every so often and like to give bigger theories there own post though I'm never too sure of myself I like to at least try. I just don't feel im very good and just try to help anyway I can, weather that is drawing attention to activity or putting in read posts I wish to try my hardest.. but I'm still held back by my mindset as I struggle to not be afraid of being lynched and I know as town your not meant to as your doing nothing wrong, but I'm not very good at that at all so over compensate.. <br><br>If your wondering why I'm just openily announcing this right at the start its because in my last town game it sorta came out naturally while I was sleepy in this really deep self reflective sorta conversation with another player  (review My last game on the first 4 pages to see that naturally) and afterwards It helped me as I could point back to it and say; 'hey this is something I already pointed out I do, stop trying to use it as a scum tell'  So.. as It kinda worked well and made others understand my thoughts sometimes I thought I'd just open with it this time.<br><br>So yeah.. thats my introduction and I hope to have a good game.<br><br>Speaking of LAMIST; the setup tells us that scum have day talk if you missed it, so please bare that in mind over the game."}

However, seeing as someone pointed out that she had done the same thing in a past town game of hers, that is a solid NAI post. She feels town because she stays consistent with the style of play that she says she uses(being open) and by saying that she plays open, she would make it hard on herself as scum to play any other way because she'd have to commit to being open all the time, which is not easy for scum to do.

My scumread on gameplay was weak at best, I was just picking a wagon on the players currently active in the game without much regard for their actual alignment. Reasoning:<br><br>- Picking someone at random is a 75% chance that the wagon is on a town player, 25% it's on a scum player.<br>- If I hit a town player, I'm likely to get bad sheep (aka scum) jumping on the wagon<br>- If I hit a scum player, I'm likely to get good sheep (aka town) jumping on the wagon, and also some kind of chainsaw defence from scumbuddies<br><br>Either way, this is a thing that helps me and the town sort the alignments of myself, gameplay and anyone else who gets caught up in the mess. It was and is 100% bait - I think that gameplays interactions with me WERE bad but that it's too tenuous to actually wagon him all the way to a lynch, but I love me some big wagons early game because you learn a lot more than if the whole game just middles around with no clear direction.

I was being honest when I said that gameplay looks like someone trying to force themselves to banter and be relaxed. I think that's evident regardless of gameplay's alignment here. I think them trying to discredit me and cut down my interaction is bad play, potentially scummy but not like a glaring scumtell. <br><br>Overall I highlighted these things and people commented on the stuff that went on - mostly people were focussed on the interactions between gameplay/ryan/me right? That's what town should/would do, focus on trying to sort the game. But Dierfire? He's just like, \"well I don't have reads but I think rb is town so I'll sheep him\" - cue alarm bells. <br><br>Of everyone who got on that wagon, Dierfire has by far the weakest stated reasoning and also, has thrown some shade around and is fence-sitting on a bunch of stuff. Their play is overall scummy. Also I think you're misunderstanding the intent of this strategy - of course it's imperfect, every strategy is imperfect early game as town because if there was a perfect strategy that anyone knew then town would always win, but they don't. But in spite of that I think it's important for town to have _A_ strategy and _A_ plan. Even if it's flawed, it's going to take you to where you need to get faster than milling about in uncertainty and letting scum control the flow of the game.<br><br>Like I said, ANY direction is better than NO direction. <br><br>This discussion isn't hugely fruitful though, what I'm more interested in is what your actual reads of gameplay/ryan/martha are. Throw me in there if you want to."}

So Null. <br><br>4) Saru - Anyone who makes me have to look up an iso to remember who they are really needs to be more active. However, there first post gave good reads and there look into a players meta was certainly a change of pace I dislike how they singled them out while Nulling most of everyone. Additionally they kinda acted friendly to me and rb who at this time. The Rb thing doesn't seem too natural as he has them on a town lean close to null and literally says that \"His reasoning for scum reading Gameplay is somewhat of a reach\" which I'm interupting as; I have no idea how this is scum hunting. Which is a strange thing to have in a town pile. I also find it weird that they looked up on one players meta out of the grouping but thats not really a reason alone.<br><br>5) pitoli - I think they are likely town they ask good questions and appear to be thinking about the game as it comes<br><br>7) Dierfire - I think they are also town. I additionally think they scum are hoping to single him out as an easy flip. out of all the sheep he was the only one who really spoke about other stuff when he appeared as others and myself pointed out it appeared half done but It showed he was at least thinking about the game<br><br>8) rb - They may be scum? Like there scum hunting seems kinda non-sensical and I just came out of a game with them where I was sure there slot was town this new play style just conflicts with his play style last game that I'm suspicious of him but thats mostly from my last experience, as he wasn't as egotistical and it looked much easier to follow. <br><br>9) RyanK - I think they also may be scum based on there early interacts with rb. he didn't really question or look deep into rb's thoughts and just flipped to sheep him pretty quickly after maybe one block of text joining a weak train at the drop of a hat.<br><br>10) golden009 - Nullish? I don't like how he inflamed dierfires train with a second post and vote on the matter and I find this more scummy than Saru as he was looking / talking about just the sheeping he did when it wasn't like no one else sheeped and ignored them all, it seems that they may have noticed our weird feelings and decided to try and push for them and thats kinda why I'm suspicious of them?<br><br>11) Chuck - waits 14 years, 4 months, and 17 days for this moment. and doesn't take the moment to post. maybe he was being literal and meant this particular 90 seconds. This is just a funny way of me saying they havn't posted since page one, NULL<br><br>12) Cass - okay doki he has said a bit and joined the train, but I'm not really so scum reading him. it looks like he was putting effort into understanding and talked a bit before going so... may be town may not and really I don't have a strong read here they need to post//comment more.<br><br>13) Martha Zolanski - and here is my number one scum read. more on that coming in my next post.<br><br>OMG this Pedit x5 combo! Okay this requires its own post. I'll do that after I read martha as promised please wait."}

It could of done with expanding though. like its the only logical explanation for his read on Martha telling town he first saw her kind a bad with the late RVS but then felt that she made up for it with later posts.<br><br>they havn't inputted much but its early times and tbh they are at least trying."}

I read things but don't have time to make a huge quote filled post now. Some points:<br>- Becoming more nervous about Naomi, because she is so very nervous. But that might be null, because she is so open about it, making it all so wifom. Sigh.<br>- Dierfire gives me a scum vibe, quoting weak statistics and other non-arguments as reasons for joining a wagon.<br>- Ryan also looks scummy, isn't contributing<br>- rb still sounds like town to me, plus I agree that any kind of initiative and leadership is a good thing for town<br>- It is annoying that not everyone has posted yet. But probably means nothing, right? I guess these people havan't even picked up their role pm's yet? ( is there a way to know? Or just to wait for the mod to update?)<br>- The attacks on Martha piqued my interest - it could be Naomi- scum trying to deflect attention from Dierfire- scum. Though that requires a lot of assumptions, I must reread first so I can craft a thing with quotes to maybe support it.<br>- Still don't like Gameplay, so I'm ok with keeping my vote on him until I have a clearer opinion on the game so far. He sounds nervous somehow, like he's hiding something ( yes, that's gut). But also doesn't seem to be actively looking for scum. He takes the 'debate' with rb as a chance to post many posts with little sustance, is my impression.<br><br>And a question for rb: Why did you take your vote off gameplay at that point? Did you think there was a real chance that scum would quickhammer?

The way I see it is; there was 4 people on that train and only one really added more to the game than the subject at hand yet there the person who got singled out by others and pushed to L-2. This seems more like a scum move than a town move, so I decided to deflect to aid them.

In Mini 1800, you were a lot more cautious about committing to a vote, instead choosing to give your full thoughts on most of the early posts that game before actually casting your vote.

If Naomi chooses to announce that her play-style will be open, wouldn't it hurt her as scum to do so? Scum don't want to announce that they'll play a certain way, for fear of being caught out if they veer off that play. Do you disagree? <br><br>I think Naomi is likely town here.

Earlier in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8275559#p8275559\">272</a> he said that people probably hadn't picked up their role pm's yet so it probably means nothing. If it means nothing, why even point out that those players could be the scum team? Inconsistent thinking. Slight scum read.<br><br>Pitoli is active, asks a lot of questions(particularly like <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8276796#p8276796\">348</a>), and views things from both sides before going further with it. Strong town read.<br><br>Not sure about Martha atm tbh. I'll revisit this later.<br><br>Chuck's reasoning to scum read Naomi doesn't seem very strong. Like, I understand WHY her vote/unvote of Cass might look like an empty gesture, but I don't really think it suggests that she's bowing down to Cass' demands or wishes. Seems like she was just trying to prove a point. Most of Chuck's catch-up posts don't really say anything besides a scum read on Naomi. I want him to talk about other things besides Naomi to help me form a more accurate read. What did you think of the gameplay wagon? What about Dierfire's wagon?<br><br>I like BBT's responses to Naomi on replace in. They were ballsy as hell. I'm a sucker for that kind of stuff. Slight townread.<br><br>Glitch, what specific things about Chuck make you feel he's town or scum? What's causing you to go back and forth?

The analysis in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8274805#p8274805\">223</a> of my much-discussed vote is a good one, and is consistent with reading and understanding (and more importantly, trying to understand) the thread.

Those are both players on whom pitoli already had reads--this is more evidence of analyzing the expressed reads of others as a way to analyze alignment.<br><br>---<br>I have to go now. I didn't get a chance to finish reading Naomi-Tan (also I just realized that Expedience is Naomi-Tan). That's my next task (returning in 6-10 hours, I think)."}

If it were instead that you felt gameplay was being scummy via his reaction to rb(reading into interactions), then I would understand, however, this was not the case.

The central points that I received were that Naomi-Tan is afraid of being lynched, plays uncertainly, and engages in LAMIST behavior to avoid a lynch.

I see that there are pending questions for Martha to accompany the vote in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8280968#p8280968\">509</a>, so I'll refrain from commenting except to say that I don't find anything suspicious about it."}

She doesn't seem coordinated enough for such a tactic. In fact, I find her posts increasingly hard to follow. But I like this wagon, in fact wouldn't mind if it turned into a lynch - especially with a self- hammer! Go for it, Martha! Unless you are in fact town, then start scum- hunting instead.<br><br>And now she's saying l-2 isn't bad, because scum wouldn't quick hammer, in dirct contradiction with her earlier post (on a tablet, so sorry not going to look it up, but it's in my previous post where I vote her).</div></blockquote><br>\"obviously\" you don't have daytalk?<br><br>If you aren't following their posts isn't that kind of a red flag? I feel like that was the case for me, there were so many other things that looked initially scummy like all the deflection re: voting ryan for example, I latched onto the one thing which I'm sure is town. I think the rest is just Martha being automatically flaily and semi-literate.<br><br>I ask why it's obvious that you don't have daytalk because that's obviously not the case.<br><br>And I've always had this theory that whenever someone says something like that (initially meant as in response to when people say \"r u town??\" \"ofc lol\"), it's because they're scum automatically parsing it to \"are you claiming town?\". And they're subconsciously like \"yes, of course i am claiming town!\", and then they leave the \"of course\" behind. But the only time I noticed it the person was actually town. But this seems like a more pure form (since it wasn't in response to a clich\u00e9 question). So you're probably scum.</div></blockquote><br><br>Yeah, that attack is so predictable and makes me see you as scummier. The daytalk thing is a weak thing for me to say, i know this. Because it is only obvious to me and everyone knows that - and I know everyone knows and that I will convince exactly zero people with such a claim, so it's NAI. Latching onto a thing like that is scummy. All it means is that I can't defend myself from a timing question, you do understand that, right? There's nothing useful to say against such an accusation. You can bring it back up if Martha or I ever flips scum.<br><br>Not liking Martha's soft claim, but it does sound more like bad town play than lying scum, so, with an annoyed sigh:<br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: Martha</span> <br><br>Then this seems like a good lynch:<br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: RyanK</span> <br>Attacking people for the weakest reasons, accusing them of nonsense and things they didn't say, voting in all the safe places without much in the way of reasoning and just not at all looking town."}

Latching onto a thing like that is scummy. All it means is that I can't defend myself from a timing question, you do understand that, right? There's nothing useful to say against such an accusation.

Going to keep my vote here for now. <br><br>Ryan is a very strange character in my eyes. Like, the way he posts and the questions he asks come off as VI, but it seems almost TOO VI. To the point where I feel like he's playing that status up after Expedience pointed out that he's playing as obvious town. I keep going back and forth on him, but his recent post where he picked at pitoli's post for semantics for like half a page(slight exaggeration) just looked really bad. And I think he knows how bad it looked, but also that's what he's trying to do, and so on and so forth. It's very hard to tell. I have to agree with Cass though in that it feels like his play isn't doing anything to progress the game, but only giving the perception of doing so. The jumpy vote play feels like he's looking for reactions, but he never really follows up and then just moves on. It's inconsistent in that regard. <br><br>As for golden, your <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8280973#p8280973\">511</a> feels very convoluted. Still don't like your reasoning. Or, atleast, I don't understand it. I don't get how my vote made you want to look closer at Dier. If you were already voting him, then you must have had reasons of your own for this. How did my vote add on to those reasons?<br><br>The whole thing about Martha's and Cass' posts lining up in terms of vote timing also feels somewhat coincidental. Like, I think something like 3 wagons(feel free to correct me on this) have happened so far, and so I don't see how something like that can't happen purely by coincidence. @pitoli: is it more the timing of their votes or the reasoning that felt too similar? Or both?<br><br>I like Expedience's entry into the game. They seem to want to find out who's town instead of just outright scum. Considering there are more town than scum in a game of mafia, looking for town first over looking for mafia first is a legit strategy. And a pretty pro-town one. Helps with PoE. Also was town-reading their predecessor so I feel confident about that read still.<br><br>@Chuck: Now that Naomi has been replaced out, what do you think of Expedience?<br><br>Also, Glitch, I had a question for you:<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8278478#p8278478\" class=\"postlink\">post 412</a>, Saru wrote:</cite>Glitch, what specific things about Chuck make you feel he's town or scum?

She's either a very easily-influenced townie or scum with a reason to be riding those shifts in momentum. I think what first pinged me was the fact that Martha was so nonchalant about sheeping Cass onto the gameplay wagon (their words not mine, see below). It didn't really read to me like they were asserting pressure onto gameplay - they just wanted to wagon. Note that she doesn't really say anything about Cass's alignment before being very happy to sheep.

She's either a very easily-influenced townie or scum with a reason to be riding those shifts in momentum. I think what first pinged me was the fact that Martha was so nonchalant about sheeping Cass onto the gameplay wagon (their words not mine, see below). It didn't really read to me like they were asserting pressure onto gameplay - they just wanted to wagon. Note that she doesn't really say anything about Cass's alignment before being very happy to sheep.

Martha says being jumpy with votes is sus, which I gotta disagree with. Votes are a tool, applying them properly whenever and wherever they\u2019re needed is a useful and acceptable strategy. Ryan\u2019s questions about sheeping, jumping onto vote Martha, followed by his response to Martha\u2019s accusation that he sheeped when he voted for her are giving me a bit of a town read on Ryan. His defenses are pretty collected and simple, he\u2019s not overreacting. I like what I see on him, and even though I didn\u2019t agree with Martha about jumping votes it didn\u2019t really give me a scum read on her.

She doesn't seem coordinated enough for such a tactic. In fact, I find her posts increasingly hard to follow. But I like this wagon, in fact wouldn't mind if it turned into a lynch - especially with a self- hammer! Go for it, Martha! Unless you are in fact town, then start scum- hunting instead.<br><br>And now she's saying l-2 isn't bad, because scum wouldn't quick hammer, in dirct contradiction with her earlier post (on a tablet, so sorry not going to look it up, but it's in my previous post where I vote her).</div></blockquote><br>\"obviously\" you don't have daytalk?<br><br>If you aren't following their posts isn't that kind of a red flag? I feel like that was the case for me, there were so many other things that looked initially scummy like all the deflection re: voting ryan for example, I latched onto the one thing which I'm sure is town. I think the rest is just Martha being automatically flaily and semi-literate.<br><br>I ask why it's obvious that you don't have daytalk because that's obviously not the case.<br><br>And I've always had this theory that whenever someone says something like that (initially meant as in response to when people say \"r u town??\" \"ofc lol\"), it's because they're scum automatically parsing it to \"are you claiming town?\". And they're subconsciously like \"yes, of course i am claiming town!\", and then they leave the \"of course\" behind. But the only time I noticed it the person was actually town. But this seems like a more pure form (since it wasn't in response to a clich\u00e9 question). So you're probably scum.</div></blockquote><br><br>Yeah, that attack is so predictable and makes me see you as scummier. The daytalk thing is a weak thing for me to say, i know this. Because it is only obvious to me and everyone knows that - and I know everyone knows and that I will convince exactly zero people with such a claim, so it's NAI. Latching onto a thing like that is scummy. All it means is that I can't defend myself from a timing question, you do understand that, right? There's nothing useful to say against such an accusation. You can bring it back up if Martha or I ever flips scum.<br><br>Not liking Martha's soft claim, but it does sound more like bad town play than lying scum, so, with an annoyed sigh:<br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: Martha</span> <br><br>Then this seems like a good lynch:<br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: RyanK</span> <br>Attacking people for the weakest reasons, accusing them of nonsense and things they didn't say, voting in all the safe places without much in the way of reasoning and just not at all looking town.</div></blockquote><br>Sorry for so many big quotes, but they\u2019re really good. This post backs up my town read on Cass. The sync between the two players voting the same honestly just doesn\u2019t seem serious enough for me to wonder, just because with thirteen people the likelihood of two people making the same three votes in a row is pretty high. Doesn\u2019t seem super scummy to me or anything. And this response Cass has here is solid. That, or.. She\u2019s just insanely clever scum and set that whole post up in advance. xD Martha\u2019s soft claim didn\u2019t sit well with me so I personally would have left my vote on her, but I can\u2019t blame her for her Ryan vote as his actions are just bad.<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8282564#p8282564\">591</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8282567#p8282567\">592</a>, then <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8282588#p8282588\">593</a>\u2014&gt; Martha got it covered, just not liking RK through 600\u2026 he\u2019s acting scummy but I still have 6 more pages to catch up on and keep reading.<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8283233#p8283233\">625</a> - I can\u2019t make heads or tails of pitoli y\u2019all. ugh<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8284319#p8284319\">636</a> - <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8284354#p8284354\">640</a> I am not confident with town reading gameplay but I think my subconscious is town reading him anyway.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8284418#p8284418\" class=\"postlink\">post 646</a>, Expedience wrote:</cite>Guys, Martha and Ryan are both town.</div></blockquote><br>Okay so this may be a bit of a growth moment for me because I\u2019m still a relatively new player to Mafia online. I play a lot in person with friends, but it\u2019s always the same group of people and we\u2019ve only played each other online two or three times over email. This will be my third game here on MafiaScum and I\u2019ve played some others a looong time ago on another forum. My friends are pretty much more newbish than I am and would probably be just stupid if you saw them lol.<br><br>So, that said, RyanK. I feel like my read on him is an area of growth for me as I learn more about how to play well. His play style, lack of logic, and seemingly stupid arguments/votes/actions are all making me want to vote him. Yet I\u2019ve seen multiple times where people have said that it\u2019s stupid to vote Ryan because of lack of logic or because he has a bad play style.

Can y\u2019all help me understand this?<br><br>If I think about why that may be the case, bad play style could be the case with scum or town, so it shouldn\u2019t be a determiner in lynches. Likewise, illogical argumentation could be on both sides, so it should not be a determiner either. I struggle with that though because scum necessarily has to create fallacious arguments arguing against those they know for a fact are innocent. So I\u2019m just struggling with that. Am I missing something?<br><br>Besides playstle, communication, logic, arguments made, associations, and just plain gut feeling which isn\u2019t reliable, what are you supposed to look for that I am not getting?<br><br>Cause Ryan just doesn\u2019t sit well with me but the pressure seems to be coming off of him in the mid 600s.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8284460#p8284460\" class=\"postlink\">post 650</a>, Expedience wrote:</cite>Yes, golden<br><br>Ryan townslipped, and his erratic behavior is NAI.

I think knowing myself I\u2019m just too overly concerned with that and while I work hard and feel like I do a good job not acting in my self interest over the town\u2019s, there\u2019s still that feeling inside that I (and I would think we all) have to ignore when evaluating the game.

He still was fairly nitpicky and arbitrary in many of his posts, but I got the sense that it was heading somewhere. The longer the game went on the more he drew his questions out to conclusions, and stuck by some reads. In this game, nothing is sticky about his posts or votes.

The only exception is rb and this is where<br>Three comes in - his votes and attention has been strangely concentrated on rb. The most fake and pushed reasons on all of his votes are always on rb.

Of all the things he said, his reads on other players besides Naomi gave me flashes of towniness. Whenever he talked about Naomi I just got the feeling that she would be an easy person to deathtunnel - even if that would not lead to an eventual lynch (because she probably would have been defended, by you and me most notably). I could see scum doing that to avoid being associated with a D1 mislynch.<br><br>Of the two Glitch seems more like the type to go with the flow. He said he put his vote on Naomi for pressure, which went nowhere, then switched to Ryan when that was the hot new topic in the thread. I read your case on Glitch and while I'm not sure I'm convinced, he doesn't seem to really have interacted with anybody very much. So it's hard to say this is distancing when there's no relationships to contrast it against for him (that would be the more alarming issue for me). Rereading his posts now, he does seem to be laid back in general, but there's a self consciousness to him I can't put my finger on. This is slightly different but still related to when you said he \"felt forced\", but it does tend to bother me.<br><br>I thought it was unfair of both of them to be saying Naomi was \"obsessed\" (Glitch's words I think) with her newness and that she kept bringing it up. Imo, the only reason it kept on coming up was that people had a huge problem with post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8271440#p8271440\">7</a> and kept referring to it. That wouldn't have been a fun place to be if she was town, but I thought she was doing a fair job of fielding the suspicion on her.<br><br>Of the two, I'm more paranoid of Chuck, but I see more explicit reasons for why we might lynch Glitch."}

Your theory, as I understand it, seems to be that I should have had a strong reason for a vote. My contention is that I didn't see any strong reasons for my vote (that is, I didn't see anything that was powerfully indicative of alignment on which to base my vote).<br>If you disagree, then could you explain what strong reason you were expecting from me at that stage of the game?<br>If you think that something else is missing, then could you explain what else should I clarify for you?</div></blockquote><br>No, not really a stronger reason, but definitely more flushed out then what you initially provided. You come off as a player who analyzes a situation thoroughly before taking action(as either alignment) and seem to place a vote on someone not really because you have a strong reason, but mainly because you view the progression of their play and come to a conclusion. This is evident by your reads on both Ryan(<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8280024#p8280024\">485</a>) and Naomi(<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8282048#p8282048\">529</a>). One thing I'm curious about is why you felt you didn't really have to go into an analytical read before placing your vote? One might assume it was a pressure vote, but this was never indicated at any point after the gameplay wagon fell apart. One thing I would ask of you is if you could now give a analysis of gameplay's posts up to this point(similar to your previous ones) and what your feelings are overall from looking at them. Basically, where do you stand on him now?<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8292928#p8292928\" class=\"postlink\">post 926</a>, Chuck wrote:</cite>Saru, what is your past experience with Dierfire?</div></blockquote><br>Most of this is discussed in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8280943#p8280943\">507</a> but overall, my past experiences point to Dierfire having a robotic style of play regardless of his alignment. It gets really hard to read him unless you try looking at the smaller details, as I'm trying to do. His comments on players is just generic Dierfire imo. It's not really indicative of anything. But how he goes about trying to justify those comments makes me feel might be the key to me being able to get a stronger read on him compared to our last game where he was scum and I gave him the benefit of the doubt all the way through to the last day. Generally, I'm a lot more cautious."}

But more than that, if he were playing scum I cannot see how the way he's playing would be more conducive to his wincon. It'd be much easier and much more fruitful as scum imo to stay on any of the swingy wagons once votes started adding up - or better yet, driven home this Ryan lynch already. I believe this regardless of Ryan's alignment; if town!Ryan, scum!rb could easily justify joining the wagon due to the nature of the arguments of everyone on that wagon already (including me, when I said \"policy lynch\"); if scum!Ryan, scum!rb gets easy town points for bussing his partner and moreover, losing a bad partner isn't that costly."}

Secondarily, he has expressed that he is reading Saru, Expedience, and pitoli as Town (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8294654#p8294654\">1016</a>).<br><br>I'll look at the RyanK case first. The essence of this case is theoretically sound; Mafia players would love to be able to play as RyanK is (no contiguous thought process, no meaningful effort to actually solve the game beyond single post quotes at a time) if they could do so without being lynched. This bothers me as well, which is why I've been trying to push RyanK away from the current style in favor of one that offers more comprehensive reads that can be analyzed for motivation in greater depth. My read is still that the specific single-post quotes and things that RyanK seems to feel indicate alignment are more likely to come from Town, but it is a feature of that style that my read will be unable to progress on RyanK while it lasts, and it's not implausible to me that a Town player would find that sufficient cause to vote for RyanK--particularly after prompting RyanK for more substantive reads multiple times without success, as gameplay506 has done (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8286059#p8286059\">736</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8287888#p8287888\">770</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8288160#p8288160\">780</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8296284#p8296284\">1050</a>).<br>If gameplay506 is Mafia, this line of attack would most resemble a Mafia player targeting a Town player playing weakly, such that I would not expect RyanK and gameplay506 to both be Mafia.<br><br>The case on rb is not one that moves me. Many items involve associations between RyanK and rb. I feel that the awkward reactions by RyanK to rb early in the game (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8271904#p8271904\">51</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8271940#p8271940\">60</a>) that are cited are far more plausible if RyanK is Mafia and rb is Town than if they are both Mafia (RyanK seems eager to flatter rb, which doesn't seem an obvious interaction between Mafia players). Another item is that rb is taking things out of context or applying ideas inconsistently (claiming to be a likely N1 kill but wanting to explain things D2, reading me as Town now despite having a negative reaction to my first vote). I don't find these items very persuasive, and certainly not persuasive enough to override my reasons for reading rb as Town (initially this was for the way that rb helped move the game out of RVS, but I think that stronger evidence would be the way that rb shows evidence of reading the game over again starting in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8284562#p8284562\">659</a> with some read progression). While I don't agree with the case on rb, I don't feel that anything about it makes gameplay506 likely to be Mafia; it is certainly plausible to me that a Town player, particularly one focused on RyanK, would see rb reading RyanK as Town and gameplay506 as Mafia as a sign of a chainsaw defense.<br><br>As a last note, the Town reads are not greatly detailed but they are mostly consistent. I agree that pitoli is showing evidence of trying to read players, and that Naomi-Tan (now Expedience) seemed to exhibit a Town mindset when actually dealing with the game (and that opening post was NAI). The read on Saru wasn't detailed, so I'll ask about it in a separate post.<br><br>Overall, both of the major cases are unpersuasive but do not show any clear evidence that gameplay506 is not trying to read other players. They could easily come from a Town player, but do not seem particularly difficult for a Mafia player to feign. I've no objection to the reads on pitoli and Expedience. Barring something terrible in the Saru read, gameplay506 remains a Null read to me."}

His posts throughout the entire thread are consistent and seem to be genuine, at least from what I\u2019ve looked at.<br><br>Gameplay - Pretty stuck up and gets on my nerves. He\u2019s stuck to Ryan from early in the game and really lobbied against him the whole time. I don\u2019t really get why he\u2019s so stuck and set on getting him lynched, however, it seems like it\u2019s too stupid of a move to stay so hard-core against Ryan if he\u2019s scum because scum would know better than to draw that much attention, right? I\u2019m not really scum reading him just because he would be too stupid to be scum this way and I feel like he would play smarter.<br><br>Martha - Her whole episode of being down with her own lynch is just weird to me. Why would town be happy about themselves getting lynched? It doesn\u2019t help anything unless their death is one of the notoriously awful info lynches. (-_-) And apparently since it\u2019s so well known that that\u2019s only something a shit player would do, I don\u2019t see how the whole excitement over getting lynched could be townish.<br><br>Then there\u2019s the fact that she repeatedly reiterates how town she is and throws in a soft claim. I just don\u2019t like it. Plus, she\u2019s on the Ryan wagon which I think even though there\u2019s 5 votes on it right now I get the feeling it\u2019s over because we\u2019ve gotten what we need out of it and I think there\u2019s enough people satisfied with his reaction that we won\u2019t reach a lynch.<br><br>Before putting her as a scum read, one note. She points out in 716:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8285561#p8285561\" class=\"postlink\">post 716</a>, Martha Zolanski wrote:</cite>Golden seems unhelpful, btw. There's something fishy about him. Look at his iso then judge. And you're vote of me is unreasonable.

I am suspected, thus, you get the opportunity to vote for me.</div></blockquote><br><br>So I went and ISO\u2019s golden and he <span style=\"font-style: italic\">has</span> been pretty useless.

Helps with PoE and town hunting is a thing. Also thought predecessor was town, so that helps. Don't like recent posts however with the whole \"absolute\" reads on people like Ryan. The way she calls Ryan a mislynch feels like she's too sure of herself. Difference between being confident and being absolute. Absoluteness is not really the hallmark of a mafia game, at-least not before a flip. Strong town read. <br><br>Martha - Was hard to read. Still is. Some of her votes seem OMGUS near the start but feels like she's trying to put in authentic effort towards reading people in her more recent posts, and I liked the effort put into analyzing the play of rb/Ryan. Don't know what to make of the soft-claim, but it felt genuine. Very slight town lean.<br><br>Ryan - Mostly talked about in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8289684#p8289684\">884</a>. Wouldn't cry over a lynch on him because he's shown no real sign of improvement from what was discussed, but I'm hoping he'll step up sooner than later to help me form a more coherent read on him besides just WIFOM reasoning. Null.<br><br>gameplay - Almost all of his posts focus on either Ryan or rb. Can't read him on anything else. Don't see the point in this incessant tunnel if he's town, but also don't see what he achieves as scum. Again, not a fan of the \"absolute\" style reads. His frustration towards Ryan is understandable and does feel genuine. Still need more posts from him that don't include either Ryan or rb. Null until more diverse content can be parsed from.<br><br>BBT - Liked the entrance, but did 0 after that. Looks like he might end up being a replace out so I have literally no opinion on him at this point. <br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8296389#p8296389\" class=\"postlink\">post 1052</a>, Dierfire wrote:</cite><span class=\"noboldsig\">@Saru</span><br>You asked me in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8293032#p8293032\">930</a> why I didn't feel a need to \"go into an analytical read\" before I placed my vote on gameplay506.

If you agree with me that those first 130 posts are not tremendously informative, then I don't understand your problem with my vote.</div></blockquote><br>My point is: why no analysis on gameplay specifically before the vote? Your reasoning was just \"X is town therefore Y is more likely to be scum\" which doesn't come off as analyzing but just providing some convoluted statistical reasoning. I think the first 130 posts were more than informative and were more than fertile ground for analysis(which again, seems to be your strong point), at-least enough for you to either give a more compelling reason to vote or to hold off from voting altogether. Do you usually find yourself analyzing situations before a starter vote or is this a misread on your style of play? I'm mostly drawing from my own experience with you, so more insight into your thought process in that regard would be helpful.<br><br>@pitoli: Do you feel owning up to sheeping makes it any better than the sheeping you accuse Martha of? What part of Martha's explanation for her sheep doesn't feel logical? Why is yours any better?<br><br>@rb: Why does Ryan have to be a scum lord to be able to pull off reverse psychology? Essentially, why does he have to be pro scum to do anything if he can just follow orders in day-talk?"}

His posts throughout the entire thread are consistent and seem to be genuine, at least from what I\u2019ve looked at.<br><br>Gameplay - Pretty stuck up and gets on my nerves. He\u2019s stuck to Ryan from early in the game and really lobbied against him the whole time. I don\u2019t really get why he\u2019s so stuck and set on getting him lynched, however, it seems like it\u2019s too stupid of a move to stay so hard-core against Ryan if he\u2019s scum because scum would know better than to draw that much attention, right? I\u2019m not really scum reading him just because he would be too stupid to be scum this way and I feel like he would play smarter.<br><br>Martha - Her whole episode of being down with her own lynch is just weird to me. Why would town be happy about themselves getting lynched? It doesn\u2019t help anything unless their death is one of the notoriously awful info lynches. (-_-) And apparently since it\u2019s so well known that that\u2019s only something a shit player would do, I don\u2019t see how the whole excitement over getting lynched could be townish.<br><br>Then there\u2019s the fact that she repeatedly reiterates how town she is and throws in a soft claim. I just don\u2019t like it. Plus, she\u2019s on the Ryan wagon which I think even though there\u2019s 5 votes on it right now I get the feeling it\u2019s over because we\u2019ve gotten what we need out of it and I think there\u2019s enough people satisfied with his reaction that we won\u2019t reach a lynch.<br><br>Before putting her as a scum read, one note. She points out in 716:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8285561#p8285561\" class=\"postlink\">post 716</a>, Martha Zolanski wrote:</cite>Golden seems unhelpful, btw. There's something fishy about him. Look at his iso then judge. And you're vote of me is unreasonable.

My philosophy (and the basis of the RVS) is that a vote for weak reasons, or no reasons, is better than no vote; that is, I would happily have cast a vote for even <span style=\"font-style: italic\">weaker</span> reasons than what I gave if I couldn't find anything more worthwhile. As I was able to read rb as Town with some degree of confidence, I made that the basis of my vote.<br>Your description of my style appears to be based on <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&amp;t=66833\" class=\"postlink\">Mini 1800</a>; I had a late entrance in that game such that we had significant game-advancing content by the time that I arrived. My initial vote in that game is more typical of my \"third vote\" in a game that starts in RVS. My entrance in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=67535\" class=\"postlink\">Mini 1817</a> is a more typical pattern for my \"first vote\" and the one is this game is more like a \"second vote\" pattern (compare to my second vote in Mini 1817; compare all three to votes in previous games--one good example in which I actually got all three votes in during the same game is <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=50&amp;t=66650\" class=\"postlink\">Newbie 1712</a>).</div></blockquote><br>Ah, now I see what you're saying. I did a quick ISO of Newbie 1712 and I understand what you mean by the three votes. Essentially, the first vote is always just RVS. Second vote is based on minimal information near or at the end of RVS, and the third vote is usually put out via extensive analysis of things long after RVS is over. So your vote on gameplay here was more second vote than first or third, and so your logic behind it actually matches up nicely with that. Did I understand that correctly? Either way:<br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: </span><br>I like your explanation and it puts me more at ease about you. Still don't know how to read you but I guess I'll just have to wait and see more from you.<br><br>The Expedience wagon doesn't make any sense to me. Ok, he asked Glitch for a claim, so? Not like he's automatically forced to give one. I also don't think scum just outright asks for a claim like that. I don't however understand what the purpose of a \"claim duel\" is, and I've actually never even heard of such a thing lol.<br><br>I also didn't have much of a read on Glitch, but I do agree with Dierfire and Expedience that his tone towards Chuck when it comes to reading him seems very odd and comes off as distancing. Dierfire sums it up pretty well with this:<br><blockquote><div><cite>Dierfire wrote:</cite>You both expressed suspicion of her, so it was unclear why you felt that Chuck was suspicious given his focus on Naomi-Tan. It's the sort of thing that comes up when a Mafia player is cooperating with a partner while trying to create distance.</div></blockquote><br>I also thought that Expedience made a compelling point in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8299709#p8299709\">1126</a> against Glitch. I'm curious to see what he has to say about that. <br><br>@Expedience: I know you said you didn't want to reveal too much, but can you give atleast some idea as to what you seek to accomplish from a \"claim duel\"? It seems like you want Glitch's lynch no matter what, so why does claiming make a difference for you?"}

As I was able to read rb as Town with some degree of confidence, I made that the basis of my vote.<br>Your description of my style appears to be based on <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&amp;t=66833\" class=\"postlink\">Mini 1800</a>; I had a late entrance in that game such that we had significant game-advancing content by the time that I arrived. My initial vote in that game is more typical of my \"third vote\" in a game that starts in RVS. My entrance in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=67535\" class=\"postlink\">Mini 1817</a> is a more typical pattern for my \"first vote\" and the one is this game is more like a \"second vote\" pattern (compare to my second vote in Mini 1817; compare all three to votes in previous games--one good example in which I actually got all three votes in during the same game is <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=50&amp;t=66650\" class=\"postlink\">Newbie 1712</a>).</div></blockquote><br>Ah, now I see what you're saying. I did a quick ISO of Newbie 1712 and I understand what you mean by the three votes. Essentially, the first vote is always just RVS. Second vote is based on minimal information near or at the end of RVS, and the third vote is usually put out via extensive analysis of things long after RVS is over. So your vote on gameplay here was more second vote than first or third, and so your logic behind it actually matches up nicely with that. Did I understand that correctly? Either way:<br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: </span><br>I like your explanation and it puts me more at ease about you. Still don't know how to read you but I guess I'll just have to wait and see more from you.<br><br>The Expedience wagon doesn't make any sense to me. Ok, he asked Glitch for a claim, so? Not like he's automatically forced to give one. I also don't think scum just outright asks for a claim like that. I don't however understand what the purpose of a \"claim duel\" is, and I've actually never even heard of such a thing lol.<br><br>I also didn't have much of a read on Glitch, but I do agree with Dierfire and Expedience that his tone towards Chuck when it comes to reading him seems very odd and comes off as distancing. Dierfire sums it up pretty well with this:<br><blockquote><div><cite>Dierfire wrote:</cite>You both expressed suspicion of her, so it was unclear why you felt that Chuck was suspicious given his focus on Naomi-Tan. It's the sort of thing that comes up when a Mafia player is cooperating with a partner while trying to create distance.</div></blockquote><br>I also thought that Expedience made a compelling point in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8299709#p8299709\">1126</a> against Glitch. I'm curious to see what he has to say about that. <br><br>@Expedience: I know you said you didn't want to reveal too much, but can you give atleast some idea as to what you seek to accomplish from a \"claim duel\"? It seems like you want Glitch's lynch no matter what, so why does claiming make a difference for you?</div></blockquote><br>It makes a difference because it will get other people to vote him.<br><br>If two people enter a CLAIM DUEL, only one survives. That's how it works."}

You only read early game. I like to join wagons for pressure in early game, because it gets things moving and creates interesting patterns and reads. Logically, that means joining 'majorities', not really majorities obviously... That would be lynching. But blocks, others sheeping vocal players, semi- decent cases... Anyhing goes in that phase of the game. Why is that scummy? I'm not hiding, I'm not quick-lynching, I give you patterns to analyze. Also, it's far from the majority of players doing that, most are waiting or staying quiet.<br>Now ISO the mod, look at the voting patterns over the entire game and see if your impression of me remains the same."}

We were on Dierfire, then he made a decent post, then I made a case on martha (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8280477#p8280477\">489</a>), Pitoli &amp; Golden vaguely sheeped me but without voting. Martha defends against my case and her and me get into a fight that's mostly misunderstandings and language-issues, I think (it's pretty unreadable, I apologize for my part in that). Then Pitoli (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8280865#p8280865\">497</a>) notes that Martha's and my posts 'synch up', and we could be following eachother onto wagons. (Note when ISO-ing: Martha here increases the confusion by posting a few times with and ALT account, keyenpeydee.) <br>Now Pitoli votes Martha, and Martha votes Ryan. Rb likes Dierfire's post and joins the Martha wagon, starts pushing it, as does Pitoli. Now Expedience (replaced Naomi) joins the wagon, but still thinks Dierfire is scum too. (<span style=\"font-style: italic\"><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8280968#p8280968\">509</a> - This one reinforces my scumread on Expedience.</span>) Rb feels the wagon is going too fast now, too easy (<span style=\"font-style: italic\">I can see what he means...</span>) and unvotes Martha (also calls Saru, Pitoli and Golden town). Expedience attacks Martha and defends Ryan. Based on this - I think because he's somehow reassured that Expedience is town (<span style=\"font-style: italic\">unlike me</span>) -, rb revotes Martha(<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8281071#p8281071\">523</a>.<br>(<span style=\"font-style: italic\">Off topic: Post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8282001#p8282001\">528</a> makes me wonder if I could be wrong about gameplay; could he be Expedience's partner?</span>)<br>Now Martha says she can't defend herself because there are 'scums' on her wagon (wagon is now (4): Cass, pitoli, Expedience, rb). Martha starts to panic, suggests self-hammering, calls her own wagon good, etc. Now Ryan joins the wagon (<span style=\"font-style: italic\">can't blame him, really</span>), making it L-2.<br><br>We are now at 550 (the second vote-count). What happens right after this is also interesting. The wagon weakens, as Ryan and Expedience back off. (<span style=\"font-style: italic\">Omg, expedience looks so scummy doing that.</span>)<br>Then in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8282506#p8282506\">578</a> with just 3 votes on her, Martha soft-claims (maybe explaining the earlier panic?).

That, and he just has a bunch of one-liners that don't say too much. Dier is a lot more null than scum, but I wouldn't be upset if he were lynched, only because I'm selfish and I can't figure him out and I still remain paranoid. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\">"}

You indicated in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8316891#p8316891\">1409</a> that there was no way a town!Chuck could have possibly thought that Glitch's post before him was town, because you thought it was a scum claim(but now you're saying it was genuine). However, did you ever stop to think that Chuck never thought Glitch was town because of his hammer post? Go read <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8307639#p8307639\">1364</a> again. Chuck clearly indicates he thinks the wagon on Glitch was a wagon on town because of the swing and the fact that it was built-up quickly while Glitch was gone. At no point did Chuck ever say he thought <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8307611#p8307611\">1363</a> was genuine or a town claim. This is what YOU said he thought, not what he actually thought. His <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8319748#p8319748\">1470</a> indicates this even further.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Not really, I think you're reading too much into that. I can make up my own story as to how it has scum motivation just as easily.</div></blockquote><br>So, I'm reading too much into rb's responses, but you're not reading too much into Chuck's responses? I can also make up my own story as to how what Chuck did has town motivation just as easily, but guess what, that's not a real argument, that's just a counter-punch. How about giving some actual reasons as to why I'm reading too much into what rb said and then we can have a real discussion about it?<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8319036#p8319036\" class=\"postlink\">post 1462</a>, Expedience wrote:</cite>You're right I know, he feels town to me though and I think it's more than just that<br><br>Okay, \"passive involvement\" is an oxymoron.<br><br>It's not forced, it's a weak gut read that you got bothered by semantics. I just think that BBT is scumreading him for null things.</div></blockquote><br>This doesn't make much sense. Let's see: you admit that you have MORE reasons other than the ones initially stated to be town reading Dier(but you never give them), but you also agree that your words \"passive involvement\" is an oxymoron(which was your only reason stated to be town reading Dier), yet you still have Dier as a gut town read instead of null? Why are you town reading Dier for something you admit is BS and also something you admit is null at best. That doesn't add up and clearly looks forced.<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8319552#p8319552\" class=\"postlink\">post 1469</a>, rb wrote:</cite>I think with Saru, they made good points against Dierfire initially but it was an overreaction. The stuff Dier said was flimsy but when I re-read it didn't feel scummy, just genuinely flimsy. I think a few people detected that too, people who I townread strongly and I don't think would be buddying scum and/or defending a scumbuddy.<br><br>So even though Saru was right that Dier's entrance kinda sucked, I don't think Dier's entrance was scummy and I felt like Saru sat with that a lot and hasn't done much outside of that.<br><br>His game also fits the pattern of lurkerscum pretty much to a T. Make some decent, coherent and thoughtful posts, disappear, never really get too involved or interact overly much, low profile.</div></blockquote><br>Did you read what I said about my interactions with Dier? <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8293032#p8293032\">930</a>. My goal with Dier was to get to understand him better because I can never read him. It wasn't an overreaction more than it was something to see if I could place him either way, which I didn't succeed in, which is why I stopped trying. I would have to disagree that my push onto Dier didn't allow me to interact outside of that or be a catalyst for interaction. I had questions for golden about his weak sheep of me onto Dier, which he neglected to keep answering after a while, as well as general questions that help me sort people into reads. I'm not going to be a catalyst for interaction just for the sake of it, if that's what you mean. If I feel something is suspicious or I'm confused about it, I will investigate further with questioning and a back-and-forth discussion(i.e. Dierfire). I'm not going to be like Ryan and just throw out questions to force/fake activity, which is what scum tends to do. <br><br>You also say in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8319541#p8319541\">1467</a> that my posts fit the lurker-scum persona better than Dierfire, but the definition you gave for lurker-scum is exactly what Dier has been doing as well, but I'm supposedly a better lynch? Not sure how you justify that. <br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8320606#p8320606\" class=\"postlink\">post 1493</a>, Cass wrote:</cite>Saru is defending rb and Chuck (means nothing now, but noted for later). His lynch pool is Ryan, Golden, Dier - this looks very opportunistic and kinda lazy. Lynch the lurkers that aren't around to defend themselves. Very safe.</div></blockquote><br>This is false. I gave reasons as to why they were in my lynch pool(<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8319474#p8319474\">1465</a>). To be fair, it's something that comes out of PoE because I have lots of town/null-town reads, so I don't necessarily think that (Ryan, Golden, Dier) is the scum team; this is very unlikely, but I'm working within my reads at the moment. If they change, my lynch pool will also change.<br><br>I would also have to disagree that Ryan or Dier have been lurkers. As rb stated, Ryan is around to answer questions pretty much 24/7(at-least he was on D1) and so I don't see how Ryan would never be around to defend himself. And as previously stated, Dier is someone who tries to come in once a day and comb through the game and gives updated reads and answer questions. He's not a lurker. The only one who could be considered one at this point is Golden, but he's being replaced so I have him on the back-burner until his replacement shows up."}

Outside of his V/LAs, Dierfire hasn't done much posting at all. Again, the point is this: he fits within your definition of lurkerscum as much as I would. You can't be reading him as town and me as null or vice versa. Either you don't believe your own definition, or you don't believe your own read.

I'd like to know so we can discuss that and clear up any confusion. You indicated that you've been skimming my posts. How about actually giving them a read?"}

And no, he hasn't really \"pushed\" on 3 people. He voted gameplay because something about statistics and then he pressured golden and then voted Glitch because it was the more useful wagon after golden fell off the face of the earth. 2 of those aren't really what I'd call \"pushes.\" FWIW, I think his reasons for voting golden and Glitch were solid.<br><br>The point isn't Dier here though.

Am I wrong?<br><blockquote><div><cite>rb wrote:</cite>What I want to know is if you disagree with the lynch pool of: Gameplay, golden, Cass?</div></blockquote><br>Gameplay is town lean because most of his posts towards you have come off as genuine. I also think that some of his points about Ryan are valid and I'm also confused why Ryan is being shrugged off as \"too stupid to be scum.\" Cass is still a moderate town read because she's been consistent in the usage of her vote for pressure on D1, which she has stated time and time again is what she does it for. I am curious to see how she intends to use her vote now since it is D2, since voting for pressure starts to lose its luster after a while. golden is the only one I'd consider lynching today in that pool. So, yes, I mostly disagree.<br><blockquote><div><cite>rb wrote:</cite>Chuck is like honorary member but I think he's a bad lynch today.</div></blockquote><br>Define \"honorary.\" I'm assuming he is more of a PoE addition because you have lots of town reads?<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8324206#p8324206\" class=\"postlink\">post 1529</a>, rb wrote:</cite>Or maybe he's good, I dunno.

I've never really seen a TvS fight like the ones that have happened so far, but that's purely anecdotal. And they usually aren't SvS at this point in the game because scum cross-bussing this early in the game is just plain stupid. They usually save that kind of shtick for end-game. So that only leads me to believe that it was TvT."}

You decided that no, you'd rather veer off that and force my hand. If anything, it would be you who would be goading me into being toxic. What do you expect for someone to do when they're being called personal insults? Sit back and take it? No. Obviously they're going to get upset and talk back in some kind of way. I'm pretty sure you'd know this, seeing as you do the same thing with others. To paint me as the one goading you is just counter-punching.<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8324472#p8324472\" class=\"postlink\">post 1557</a>, Dierfire wrote:</cite>I've caught up.<br><br>I'm still reading as Town: pitoli, Expedience, rb, and RyanK.<br><br>The most recent VC indicates that we've some votes for the golden009 slot; I'll be joining that wagon.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: golden009</span></div></blockquote><br>This is an extremely scummy post. A big argument happened involving your name, and you choose not to comment on it? Really? <br><br>Let's see: you have the same exact town reads list as rb(the most active player in the game). Then, you vote the biggest wagon in the game(who doesn't even have a player behind it) with rehashed reasoning from D1. And finally, in your next post, you throw shade at me for not voting. <br><br>The fact that you chose to avoid a huge argument involving you gives me all kinds of bad feelings. Throwing shade at me and putting rb in your town reads without even addressing our argument makes me feel like you know you have his favor, and that you're trying to keep it. It wouldn't do coasting scum any good to get into direct confrontation with one of the more aggressive players in the game who also happens to be the player who's universally TR.<br><br>Dierfire/rb as part of a scum team feels like the obvious answer, and so that's why I feel it's unlikely. I doubt scum!rb would plainly admit that he town reads Dierfire for having points similar to his own.<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8324473#p8324473\" class=\"postlink\">post 1558</a>, Dierfire wrote:</cite><span class=\"noboldsig\">@Saru</span><br>Would you like to cast a vote?</div></blockquote><br>Sure. <br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Dierfire</span>"}

Mostly it just looked like insults being traded. Since you mentioned it, I went and read it over again. I'd say that some of the problem seems to be a misunderstanding of what rb was saying about you. Maybe the quote below will be helpful?<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8322192#p8322192\" class=\"postlink\">post 1514</a>, rb wrote:</cite>Are Saru's walls good enough to make him not lurkerscum? Because if Saru is not lurkerscum, he's town.</div></blockquote><br><br>My understanding was that rb essentially considered this question (\"is this a lurking Mafia player\") about both of us, and was confident answering \"no\" for me but less confident answering for you. You appear to have taken issue with this, making the point that my post count is higher than yours in part because I post sequentially--which is true but not really important here (there's a difference between \"lurking Mafia player\" and \"player with a low post count\" and so you essentially seem to be questioning why rb is more confident in one read than other).<br><br>You also said that the following things are suspicious:<br><ul><li>that I'm still reading rb as Town (or were you unaware that I was reading rb as Town D1?)--to which I'd respond that I don't feel that rb has done anything D2 that warrants changing that read</li><li>that I voted for the largest wagon--to which I'd respond that I was suspicious of golden009 D1 and I don't see why having more votes there should make me change my read</li><li>that my vote was based on D1 reasons--to which I'd respond that golden009 hasn't given me any D2 updates! (or was the point that you felt that something else D2 was highly deserving of a vote? I'd respond to that by wondering what that thing was and why you didn't point it out earlier)</li><li>that I was \"throwing shade\" at you--to which I'd respond that asking you for a vote is a pretty reasonable request when I'm trying to read you, and doesn't really hold water as an example of \"throwing shade\" (I will state very clearly when I am suspicious of another player)</li></ul>"}

You said you felt that out of those two, rb was just more likely town from a pure statistical standpoint(correct me if I'm wrong). I'd argue(and have) that using statistics to present a town read to someone(especially in the very early game) doesn't make much sense and just feels weak overall.<br><br>However, you went on to elaborate in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8273739#p8273739\">168</a> that it was rb's initiative to break out of RVS so quickly that made you feel he was trying to help town rather than hurt it and I'm assuming that was your secondary(?) reasoning for town reading him. I also felt the same way, however, you seem confident that, that one act of initiative from rb is enough for you to keep town reading him up to this point. If this is true, why? And if not, what has rb done besides that, that makes you strongly town read him?<br><blockquote><div><cite>Dierfire wrote:</cite>that my vote was based on D1 reasons--to which I'd respond that golden009 hasn't given me any D2 updates!</div></blockquote><br>I get that, but it seriously doesn't bother you that a wagon formed on a slot which was empty up to this point in D2? You've made some accusations against that slot during D1, but you don't care to actually see a response from it? How confident are you that the slot will flip scum?<br><blockquote><div><cite>Dierfire wrote:</cite>that I was \"throwing shade\" at you--to which I'd respond that asking you for a vote is a pretty reasonable request when I'm trying to read you, and doesn't really hold water as an example of \"throwing shade\" (I will state very clearly when I am suspicious of another player)</div></blockquote><br>Ok. I voted you. What's your read of me now?<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8326924#p8326924\" class=\"postlink\">post 1580</a>, rb wrote:</cite>Dierfire has 4x your posts and multiple V/LA, but you keep trying to say it's \"inconsistent\" for me to say he wouldn't be lurkerscum and that you might be. And then you have the nerve to try and tell me what I meant by my own definition, which by the way, absolutely doesn't mean that I \"must\" see Dierfire as lurkerscum and that I can't think you're lurkerscum.</div></blockquote><br>We've been over this. I'm not going to keep arguing/repeating the point. It doesn't really matter at this point because: I actually town read you from our argument because upon re-read, I can actually see what might have caused you to start to get irritated. I think it was the tail end of this post: <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8324342#p8324342\">1535</a>. I can see why you think I was attempting to mis-rep your point, but that wasn't my goal. I just felt like you were skirting my questions and that started to annoy me. I feel like both of our frustration build-up at that point led to points becoming garbled rather than more clear, and it just had a snow-ball effect."}

Also, despite you making a big deal about 'mixing it up' a lot your scumgames all have a pretty distinct feel over nausea-inducing fake confidence. That feel alone is enough for me to think you're scum."}

If it is illogical for scum to nightkill someone they are pretending to have a scum read on, then it is also illogical for you to have a scum read on me because then that is exactly what would have just happened with Martha. The only possible plus would be if I were to do that as scum, on purpose, to try to spin WIFOM about it the next day. Which, if one were so inclined, one could say I am doing at this very moment.

Given that Saru was recently thinking that I should have liked my vote less when more players joined it, it's possible that this represents the theoretical way that Saru approaches the game.<br><br>Obviously I disagree with the suspicion of RyanK, but as I've elaborated at length, I think that it's reasonable for a Town player to be suspicious of RyanK, so I can't say that it makes Saru especially likely to be Mafia.<br><br>When rb mentions Saru (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8322192#p8322192\">1514</a> says that Saru is either Town or lurking Mafia), Saru calls this a contradiction. This is also a fairly bad line of reasoning, for reasons that have been elaborated already (rb had other reasons to read me as Town, my activity was appreciably higher than Saru's even when taking into account the fact that Saru makes larger single posts while I make multiple shorter posts, rb didn't say that Saru was lurking Mafia), but seems to have cleared up since.<br><br>Overall, I've been disagreeing with most everything of consequence that Saru has said (although this is easy as most of his attention has fallen on me and rb, whom I'm reading as Town).

No. This is a terrible mis-rep of what I was saying. Actually, it's not AT ALL what I said. Quote for me where I said that I thought you were town reading rb because he was town reading you. I didn't. Don't put words in my mouth. Your town read of rb seemed to come from D1 only, and the fact that you love it when people go back and re-evaluate their reads, it didn't match up to me that you'd leave a strong town read as it were from just early D1 reasoning. Now that you made it clear that, that wasn't your only reasoning(after I prompted you about it), it makes more sense. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Dierfire wrote:</cite>When rb mentions Saru (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8322192#p8322192\">1514</a> says that Saru is either Town or lurking Mafia), Saru calls this a contradiction. This is also a fairly bad line of reasoning, for reasons that have been elaborated already (rb had other reasons to read me as Town, my activity was appreciably higher than Saru's even when taking into account the fact that Saru makes larger single posts while I make multiple shorter posts, rb didn't say that Saru was lurking Mafia), but seems to have cleared up since.</div></blockquote><br>IT IS a contradiction because your activity was NOT much more higher than mine. \"Appreciable?\" LMFAO! You came in once a day and gave reads and answers to questions like you always do. I came in and gave reads and answers to questions from multiple days at one time, which is why I had walls going. There's no real difference there, except that I had to spread myself out more due to RL as I stated previously. The funny part is, you haven't even been responding to people in real-time. I had done this with rb. This makes it so easy for coasting scum such as yourself to come up with what you're going to say next to someone who might be scum reading you.<br><br>And even if you can make the argument that your post count was higher than mine, you'd be missing the whole point of my argument with rb which was that it wasn't about raw post count, but of the content within those posts that rb seemed to take issue with initially. According to him, I was coming in and giving thoughtful posts and then just bowing out. I contended that you've done the same exact thing, but apparently that point went out the window for....reasons?? Yeah...no. That argument has still not been \"cleared up,\" as I still take issue with that contradiction. I just decided to leave it behind because I see rb as town right now, and getting into wall wars with town is what I did in Mini 1800, and that didn't end well for me.<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8333695#p8333695\" class=\"postlink\">post 1827</a>, Chuck wrote:</cite>Saru, Dierfire, pitoli, and Cass, what do you think about:<br><br>1. MathBlade?<br>2. rb vs. BBT?<br>3. Expedience?</div></blockquote><br>1. Mathblade is likely town here. One thing I noticed from Mini 1800, was that it seemed like an inherent part of Math's scum game to be using people to their advantage. Basically, talking to or questioning people in a way to get them to do their bidding for them. I don't see that from Math here at all. They seem so much more genuine about things in general, and it doesn't seem like they're trying to mislead people.<br>2. This is just rb being rb. As for BBT, I don't get why he doesn't want to explain things. I understand that he's done this before as town, but I'm not entirely sure what his reasoning is here. He needs to start explaining. I walk away from that argument as still rb town and BBT null scum. <br>3. Expedience is town. Your argument against him makes 0 sense to me. Yes, his choice to vote you right off the bat(with false reasoning) looks bad, but not scummy. The reason it isn't scummy is because after I pointed out that what he was saying about you wasn't true, he reconsidered and voted elsewhere. That wasn't a \"scum-claim\" as you called it. There's nothing wrong with people changing their minds. Town can do it, and so can scum.<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8335469#p8335469\" class=\"postlink\">post 1881</a>, Dierfire wrote:</cite>I want to discuss things more with MathBlade, but I suspect that I will end up reading her as Town for reasons that I will discuss afterward.</div></blockquote><br>How about you discuss them right now?

Like, Expedience has said that he's compromising, and you seem to think he's lying, but then you say \"oh you're not voting me but instead you're voting the biggest wagon!\" Yeah, because he's compromising. Duh.<br><br>Dierfire needs to be lynched. This is not his town game. His read of me is full of assumptions and mis-reps. town!Dierfire also doesn't hide reasoning. He admitted himself that he makes it clear how and why he feels  something about someone, but then says he'll give his reasons for town!Math at a later point. <br><br>The Ryan slot has also had zero attention on it since the end of D1, and Ryan did nothing to progress the game at all, at any point. Not lynching him because \"lol newb\" is terrible reasoning. His posts look like forced playing up of the VI card, and guess what, it's been working on some people. Remember when Ryan said his play from D1 wouldn't continue into D2? Guess what, it did. And no one bothered to question it.<br><br>House's entry into the game is solid, but @House: why do you think Dierfire is scum? You didn't really say."}

Since when did town!Dierfire hide reasoning like this? This pings me hard.</div></blockquote><br><br>Here is my line of reasoning. Martha had hinted at having a role in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8282506#p8282506\">578</a>, and the Mafia players were evidently aware of this (as they killed her N1). In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8282846#p8282846\">614</a> golden009 casts a vote for Martha (vote was on me before that). This is after the wagon on Martha largely dissolved, so why is golden009 moving his vote? He didn't have much of a chance of lynching Martha. He didn't need to move his vote to have it parked on someone who wouldn't have been lynched (the existing vote on me would have fulfilled that purpose). He didn't really need to worry that a vote on me would attract a tremendous amount of suspicion. Therefore, I'm having difficulty seeing why the vote moved if golden009 is a Mafia player with access to Daytalk (the Traitor role crossed my mind, but I think that a Traitor in MathBlade's position would most likely not claim VT).<br>You seem to be wondering why I didn't present this immediately. The thought first occurred to me after I directed MathBlade to look at the events surrounding <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8282506#p8282506\">578</a>, but I still wanted to hear what MathBlade thought. Since you object, I'll share this at the risk of introducing bias into her analysis.<br>You also seem to be asking me for prior games in which I took a similar approach. I will provide one link that occurs to me now: in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8042452#p8042452\" class=\"postlink\">Newbie 1719</a> I was (incorrectly) reading Ghubster as Town while still wanting him to answer questions posed by another player."}

Sounds like to me you were beyond sure that, that slot would have flipped scum. But then, when the replacement for it does come in, you end up just unvoting and then never providing actual scum reads or an actual vote. Your thought process with the golden slot has been utterly inconsistent. It's actually so blatant that I'm surprised I'm the only one noticing it.<br><br>And as to the quote that you posted, no, it's not me saying you town read rb because he town reads you. My point was that since you didn't respond to an argument that had your name come up so much(which is really not like you), it felt like you were giving a silent nod to rb's arguments against me. You prove this to me when you come back with the same exact stuff that rb said about me after I prompted you for a comment. Almost word for word.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Dierfire wrote:</cite>Here is my line of reasoning. Martha had hinted at having a role in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8282506#p8282506\">578</a>, and the Mafia players were evidently aware of this (as they killed her N1). In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8282846#p8282846\">614</a> golden009 casts a vote for Martha (vote was on me before that). This is after the wagon on Martha largely dissolved, so why is golden009 moving his vote? He didn't have much of a chance of lynching Martha. He didn't need to move his vote to have it parked on someone who wouldn't have been lynched (the existing vote on me would have fulfilled that purpose). He didn't really need to worry that a vote on me would attract a tremendous amount of suspicion. Therefore, I'm having difficulty seeing why the vote moved if golden009 is a Mafia player with access to Daytalk (the Traitor role crossed my mind, but I think that a Traitor in MathBlade's position would most likely not claim VT).</div></blockquote><br>Wait. So you couldn't have thought of this before-hand? Meaning, you scum read golden from D1, but all these actions you JUST described are ALL from D1. Like...what? This just sounds like an excuse to hop off the wagon on a slot whose replacement isn't one to go down so easily. Pushing someone like Math is going to be hard for you to do, and I'm sure you know this from Mini 1800. Hop off when they come in with some convoluted reasoning, nice.<br><br>Also, this:<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8280024#p8280024\" class=\"postlink\">post 485</a>, Dierfire wrote:</cite>I read over RyanK and I've noted a tendency to focus on what I might consider \"tells\" or \"slips\" in trying to find Mafia players: rb \"trying\" to lynch him early (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8271881#p8271881\">43</a>), Naomi-Tan for mentioning Daytalk (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8272339#p8272339\">88</a>), rb mentioning the number of Mafia players (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8272379#p8272379\">90</a>), gameplay being \"certain\" that rb is Town (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8276179#p8276179\">308</a>), pitoli for exaggerating the time required to type a post (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8279281#p8279281\">454</a>).

Which of them looked like they required a response from golden009? Also, as I have multiple players expressing suspicion of me, the underlined (my addition) feels...exaggerated to me.</div></blockquote><br>Whether it required a response or not really isn't the point. The point is that you sat on an empty slot's wagon(showing a commitment to your scum read on it) but as soon as it gets filled, you make for the hills. Rhyme not intended. It shows that you weren't very confident that golden was scum from the start, but the way you pushed him sure gave off the aura that you were. Also, the part that you underlined isn't exaggeration. I was talking about your waffle on golden and no one had pointed it out at the time but myself.<br><br>Also, you're now voting Cass, and so I'm surprised that having Cass as your second scum suspect, you'd choose not to vote her instead around the time that you voted golden. Like, golden wasn't around and was being replaced, but Cass was very much around to answer questions. Why didn't you have a discussion with Cass on some of things you felt off about with her instead of just sitting on the wagon of an empty slot? That right there is the coasting scum that I'm talking about and that you've played to, to a T. You don't care to have a real discussion with one of your scum reads because you can just sit back and watch an empty one get insta-lynched. No effort required on your part. <br><blockquote><div><cite>Dierfire wrote:</cite>You are saying that you were worried that I was agreeing with rb more than with you? I was agreeing with rb more than with you (I especially liked <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8324203#p8324203\">1528</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8324352#p8324352\">1538</a>!), although it's not clear to me why that would worry you.</div></blockquote><br>/sigh No. The point is getting withered away right now, but what I'm saying is this: I felt like your question towards me about placing a vote was shade. It was right after the argument with rb and you re-affirmed that rb was in your town list. When you put the two together, it felt like you were buddying up to rb. You said it wasn't shade and I guess it wasn't. That point really doesn't matter anymore, anyways.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Dierfire wrote:</cite><span class=\"noboldsig\">If you are saying that I should have picked it up earlier D2, then perhaps I should have</span> (although I didn't see you pointing it out either--if you saw a problem with my theory that golden009 was Mafia, perhaps you could have pointed it out to me sooner, and if you don't agree with me about the \"convoluted reasoning\" here then I'd like to hear why).</div></blockquote><br>Yes. The bold(mine) is very much what I'm saying. And I don't get the argument that <span class=\"noboldsig\">I</span> would have to point out that <span class=\"noboldsig\">your</span> theory on golden being mafia is wrong, because I didn't really have an issue with it. That actually isn't the issue at all. It's how and when that you've chosen to 180 on that scum read that bothers me. Combine that with my Cass point above, and I'm sure you can see why I feel you're coasting \"playing it safe\" scum."}

In fact, the only reason I'm gonna be voting Saru today is because there's so little chance that it's rb/BBT, because then it'd be rb/BBT/House, and that would be the most consistent bussing I've ever seen in a scum team and believe me I've seen my fair few.

For this reason, I'm not giving an MVP award to anyone this game, since I think both teams worked together to accomplish their goals remarkably well despite the arguments that went on in both mafia AND game chat. Notable members of each side:<br><br>- House<br>You replaced into a slot who I thought had more or less scumclaimed by page 10(surprised only rb saw this) and it took a rolecop to kill you. That's genuinely amazing. Your bus on Chuck also helped win the game, although I understand there were some misgivings about it at the time ^_^ <br><br>- Chuck<br>You were like some kind of karma houdini, dodging the noose time after time. You're also the kind of player I could never catch as scum. I really liked your performance this game.<br><br>- Saru<br>To be honest, I felt you were very lurky and that's why you got lynched! But the hentai you shared in the mafia chat was excellent quality!<br><br>- camn<br>What can I say? Replaces in and rolecops two scum, getting shot the night after replacement. You don't get better than that!<br><br>- rb<br>you had the best reads this game, and were good about pushing them. I think you started to fall behind late game due to laziness/confbias, which is a problem i have also. Still...<br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Just really coasty - I find Saru to be a good lynch, along with Gameplay/Chuck. That's my top3.<br></div></blockquote><br>-rb, day 2<br><br>never forget<br><br><br>- titus<br>I already said this in the dead chat, but it must feel fucking awesome to be killed over the vig because your townbloc was too scary for scum to contemplate. I think someone even mentioned that scum didn't have a prayer if titus was allowed to live. Solid play!"}

It made the game frustrating because people couldn't understand that it was very deliberate even after I explained it and even after gameplay's slot flipped scum - which should have been very obvious that I was town (like seriously) afterwards. <br><br>So it's as much my own fault for putting myself in the situation of being the accurate scumreads but not being able to convince people, so I probably won't play like that next time. I'll instead just put my vote where I'm 99% sure will hit scum and let the rest of the town do the rest. But that can be insanely frustrating too, as you saw with Vecna in Rocks - he picked the scum, got lynched and then still no one paid attention to why he was hated in the town. Seeing that from a scum perspective made me not want to be that guy, I could basically just feel Vecna seething from that. But hey, I think it's better to just be dead and less invested in the outcome than to have to fight through to LyLo as a slot under pressure. So tiresome."}

If you ever reach a situation that wasn't covered, you're free to PM me as it could actually take forever to cover everything.<br><br>After or during a game, decide if something better could have been done if  particular situation to reach your win-con. Apply it when the conditions are similar and the win-con is the same. If it ever fails you, compare the situations. If there aren't any differences between the situations, decide which course of action was better and use the course of action that is better next time."}

What works in 9p games won't work in 32p games. What works against House won't work against Titus.<br><br>What you need to do is derive the general principle that underpins the strategy and use it. If camn fakehammers to bait mafia, don't think that fakehammering is a great move that catches mafia. It is the principle of \"baiting the mafia with false information to provoke them into revealing themselves\" that underpinned it. Understand this, and a lot of options will be open to you; for example, you might start a wagon on an obvious target to provoke mafia into leaping on eagerly. Or you might claim to scumread X so strongly that you'll quickhammer him during LyLo, and see who tries to set up a 1v1 between you and X in LyLo.<br><br>By thinking deeper, you will find yourself able to adapt, granting you far more versatility."}
