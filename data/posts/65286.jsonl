That and the fact that he misrepresented my post. <br><br>Though, ink, for someone who's been digging into my past games, you must've realised that the last game I've played was in early 2014, when there was only nighttalk. My so-called \"fake townslip question\" you are eyeing is genuine. In my first game I was also lynched for an alleged 'fake townslip'. I was VT. Maybe I'm just a shitty player, but because of that being accused of fake townslips just aggravates me. But anyways, I'm more interested in talking about this:<br><br>One silver lining about being the usual D1/D2 town lynch (which, sad to say, I still have no idea why it keeps happening. I just usually ask questions and lightly pressure people early in the game to see reactions and gather information) is that after a while I tend to see patterns about my wagon. <br><br>A few things I've noticed henceforth were these: <br>- The people spearheading my wagon with reasons of their own tend to be town. <br>- The people who defend me tend to be town as well. <br>- People who sit on my wagon without a definite reason tend to be scum. (i.e. Syndesis)<br>- People who seem to like my wagon but don't vote for me tend to be scum. (Shortcut?)<br><br>Because of this I don't particularly like how Syndesis and Shortcut are looking right now. Syndesis has only posted 2 posts so far, which are essentially \"Hi, so many posts to read through lol\" and then voting me with no explanation. <br><br>Shortcut has been relatively active but flitting in here and there and not making any reads. The fact that his vote is still on Nino even though he seems to have more likely candidates by now bothers me.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Syndesis</span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">FOS: Shortcut</span><br><br>If you have to lynch me D1, pay attention to my wagon after I flip.

Essentially, the crumb will only make sense after I am forced to claim. <br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">This is so there is no way my crumb or the fact that I have a crumb would give any kind of extra information to scum.</span> Instead, it is a way for me to inform the rest of the town that I had a <span style=\"font-style: italic\">consistent</span> role from the beginning, something which scum is unlikely to have. It doesn't necessarily mean a PR softclaim. I could've crumbed \"vanilla townie\" for all you know. <br><br>So I don't get your argument in that it isn't a legitimate action for me to take as town. <br><br>@Regarding me as a 2009 player: I just need to clear it up that I have only played 4 games on this site so far - 2 in 2009 and 1 in 2014. In all of them, I was either lynched early, or the game ended early for any other reason. While I'm not trying to excuse being a tentative or bad player, I hope you can consider this fact before anyone points out the fact that I don't play very well as being scummy because \"if I'm town I would be better at this since I'm a 2009 player\". <br><br>Anyway, Shortcut's latest posts are extremely scummy. He's my top scumread at the moment and I will explain why after I ISO him. Please tell me I'm not the only one who is seeing this. <br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: ShortcutButton</span> before I start my analysis."}

Did he suddenly find me scummy after my post? No, he said nothing of the sort.

Without actually addressing my very fair dislike of his quote, because like I've mentioned above, what he's saying in his quote was essentially \"Well I want to vote for you now that you mentioned I was scummy for not voting you\". It is a very justifiable reaction to his sudden, unwarranted change in mind. If he thought he was scum from the beginning, then why didn't he place his vote on me from the very beginning?

One, I probably should have said crumbed instead of softclaimed (I occasionally use them interchangeably which I shouldn't, but etc). Two, mine isn't wrong. And since it's integral to why Kirroha is scum let me just say it (since, again, scum will be able to figure it out anyway since I have): Kirroha has, in fact, breadcrumbed vanilla town in post 107: \"xiang'cao'nong'min.\" It's a transliteration (pinyin) of Chinese for \"vanilla peasant\" (at least according to the internet).<br><br>And to preempt the \"lolol implosion is rolefishing\" argument because SOMEONE is going to make it: (1) her crumbing vanilla townie is the main reason I think she's scum and (2) scum will be able to figure this out anyway; I'm just opening it up so that the town can discuss it too.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I stated quite clearly that my crumb is in plain sight, but is impossible to figure out unless you know the language.</div></blockquote><br>I don't know the language (I took Chinese in high school over 4 years ago and remember ostensibly nothing); I just recognized what it was and then googled for it. Google translate can't but there are other sites that can translate from pinyin to English. Google translate also gives pinyin. It's not hard to put the relatively few normal roles into google translate and see which ones give what you said.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I have deliberately also made it a crumb that isn't Google Translateable either, so that nobody will be able to tell what it is until I have to explain the crumb myself. Essentially, the crumb will only make sense after I am forced to claim.</div></blockquote><br>There are essentially two things that could be going on here. Either Kirroha is scum and is lying about this (relatively unlikely) or Kirroha is telling the truth that she thought the crumb wasn't decipherable. If it's the latter then it makes plenty of sense as a scum strategy: you can kill the momentum on your wagon without having to commit to claiming anything risky, since it's a vt breadcrumb. I can sort of see the motivation for this as town but it seems way less likely, especially since Kirroha has dropped hint after hint after hint to what she's softclaiming; as scum she wouldn't necessarily care if it got out that she was claiming vt (it doesn't necessarily harm scum) but as town it is harmful for her to be known as a vt (gives scum more info on who to nk). <br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">This is so there is no way my crumb or the fact that I have a crumb would give any kind of extra information to scum.</span> Instead, it is a way for me to inform the rest of the town that I had a <span style=\"font-style: italic\">consistent</span> role from the beginning, something which scum is unlikely to have. It doesn't necessarily mean a PR softclaim. I could've crumbed \"vanilla townie\" for all you know. </div></blockquote><br>Again, having a \"consistent\" role from the beginning is not hard as scum when that role is vanilla townie. Also note that she seems to be backhandedly implying that crumbing vt is something very town-ish to do (which it isn't) by comparing it with this idea of having a consistent role.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>@Regarding me as a 2009 player: I just need to clear it up that I have only played 4 games on this site so far - 2 in 2009 and 1 in 2014. In all of them, I was either lynched early, or the game ended early for any other reason. While I'm not trying to excuse being a tentative or bad player, I hope you can consider this fact before anyone points out the fact that I don't play very well as being scummy because \"if I'm town I would be better at this since I'm a 2009 player\". </div></blockquote><br>Fair enough, but the read of you as competent is more based on you making cogent arguments and the fact that you're arguing from past experience than your join date.

Implosion's theory about her being somehow scum pretending to hide a \"Crumb\" in a way that is so obvious when it has so many risks just so that she can stop her wagon later is far fetched and very unlikely, and if she wanted to keep it hidden until a few days later like you suggested she wanted to do, she would not have implied this in her later post:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>kirroha wrote:</cite>It doesn't necessarily mean a PR softclaim.

It is so rude. Many of the \"scumtells\" were things that I would also have done in her position so I feel strongly that she is town.  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_surprised2.gif\" alt=\":o\" title=\"Surprised\">  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_surprised2.gif\" alt=\":o\" title=\"Surprised\"> Thus, I am still very, very against a kirroha lynch.

The word thing is a nitpick, specifying town would be less concise there, and I was originally going to say \"because one would want to out as few roles as possible d1d2\" but that is pretty awkward. <br>The latter was poorly phrased by me. I meant I was willing to put you to l-1 day 2 -or- save my vote for an eventual hammer for far later.

Currently awaiting some BBT-RC-IAI interaction, I know that the town within this set have an interest in sorting each other and it'll be interesting to see what comes out of the exchanges."}

If that was my purpose I'd have claimed Miller or Macho Townie w/ gun or something, or even Cop.

I agree with RC in that the way she expressed concern over the wagon is likely scum-indicative, but it's dependent on how kirroha follows up that concern as well. Given her claim that there are likely scum on the BBT wagon given how fast it popped up, I'm curious to see what names she specifically indicts.<br><br>I actually really don't like BBT's opening, I was posting from class earlier and thought it was kinda weird but thinking more about it I really don't like characterizing tojam's selfvote as awful.

I also voted RC-senpai later too because he was not talking. ink is town-like, Syndesis has not talked much for me to think what she is. She was just jumping on the kirroha wagon for fun, which is weird, and her reasons later were weird too. I do not mind lynching Syndesis but I would rather lynch Shortcut or tojam2. All I want is that the day 1 lynch is a person who is lurking, or if we want to lynch a non-lurker, we must be almost definitely sure they are scum. I think day 1 it will be a bad idea to lynch talkative people, because if we lynch too many people who actually add to the discussion, it will make it easier for scum later to stay hidden because nobody is discussing. That is why I thought the kirroha wagon was stupid also."}

I mean, not as a person, but as a player. He's got literally only 12 posts and we're on our 20th-ish page! I don't get why everyone is letting him skirt by unchecked, but I ain't having that shit. <br><br>2) Ink (scum as fuck)<br>Shortcut is no longer around, so I'm going to give that slot a blank slate until they post enough to warrant suspicion. So I'm thinking this fucker is the caboose on this mantrain of scumfuckery. What was eir reason for wanting me lynched again? Me making you guys wait for my reads, me raging at Kill la Kill (which happened like 10 pages again - try harder, fool), and me bugging RC... lol wat? And I thought you were scumreading Killz just a few posts ago? But okay, sheeping BBT is easier than putting your own neck on the line and possibly getting lynched once I flip. Fucking noted.<br><br>3) Raskolnikov (scummy)<br>Sparse posting. Never really seems to say anything. I don't trust it. <br><br>4) I Am Innocent (scum-ish)<br>How the literal fuck is me not voting within a two day period a scumtell? Seriously, how. Not to mention the weird stuff you pulled with Kirroha's wagon. The only reason you're not higher on my scum-o-meter is because you tend to be unafraid of starting wagons, even if it's for reasons I think is silly.<br><br>5) Implosion (scum-ish)<br>Imo, this person tends to slip under the radar, and seems really swingy - case in point being the Kirroha wagon. But at the same time, it could just be really bad town play. Iunno.<br><br>6) RadiantCowbells (null/scum-ish)<br>I have no idea what this guy is even doing. I'm familiar enough with his reputation to think it's probably just his style, but I'm not super convinced that's all there is to it. He said he generally doesn't play games as town because he usually gets NKed. The fact that he hasn't replaced out might mean he's scum trying to throw us off the trail by saying that and using it as an excuse to not have to elaborate on him voting off townies... maybe? Idk. Itvs very WIFOM so I'll stop with that train of thought. My tiny peanut brain cannot handle.<br><br>7) Taisho (null)<br>Nothing much to go off of yet, but it's worth mentioning that I was really suspicious of the first person in this slot.<br><br>8) Syndesis (null-townish)<br>Avant garde play tends to read town for me since scum will usually make sure all their arguments hold under scrutiny. Her declining to elaborate on some of her reads doesn't seem like something scum would do.<br><br>9) BBT (null/town-ish) <br>As annoyed as I am that BBT voted me for bullshit reasons (really? You think I'm trying to imitate my town play as scum? Reeeeally?) I don't think it's alignment indicative. I feel like scum is jumping on the wagon he started for a free easy turbo-lynch, but that's it. I'm not too worried about his bouts of inactivity and promises to catch up later. He did that in my last game, too, and he was town. It might just be his style. Meatworld can be a bitch sometimes. So it could be that, too. <br><br>10) Kill la Kill (town-ish)<br>Again, being confrontational tends to read town to me, and this person is as good as they come when it comes to shit talking. So town for now.<br><br>11) Nico (towny)<br>I was originally weirded out by her reverence for Radiant, but I'm cool with it now. Her scum hunting seems real legit. I also liked her defense of Kirroha.<br><br>12) Kirroha (town as fuck)<br>This is the general concensus, and I honestly see no reason to challenge it."}

BBT's inactivity wasn't nearly as dire (he had at least 20 more posts than Shortcut at the time he dropped out, and toejam literally had only 12 posts), and what he said between those periods of silence were similar to what I've seen him do as Town.

That's because the second day started about the same time this game kicked off, and that's around the same time my depression started creeping back.<br><br>My day 2 play is similar if not identical to my play here, and it's not as if I suddenly changed alignments mid-game. <br><br>Okay that's all. I have important shit to get to see you in a few hours."}

How about you post your reads list too, huh?<br><br>8) Killa (town-ish)<br>You should post more, me thinks.

Idk, I haven't put a ton of thought into him since the claim. When someone makes a pr claim on d1, unless I have a very strong scumread on them (and I can only think of one game that fits that category), I more or less file them into the back of my head until later. I guess it's inaccurate to say that I think he's the least likely scum on your wagon (or a particularly unlikely one). More so that the claim will likely help resolve itself to some degree. Basically every night he doesn't die makes him more likely scum. Even given that I suspect he'll probably die tonight if he's town. <br><br>Essentially I feel like I don't have to think about kts right now. If he's alive tomorrow then I'll think more; but if he's town then he's likely to die and it's wasted effort."}

The fact that the wagon stayed at l-1 or l-2 for like half a week or a week or something like that when there had been no recent posts from the slot and very little pre-existing posting (not enough to get a strong read imo) felt off. GR's posting on replacing in really didn't feel like i-just-replaced-into-a-scum-slot. His reaction to kirroha's reaction test felt genuine, and he just immediately started attacking people in every direction in a way that really didn't strike me as something that scum would do if they replaced into a wagoned slot. It feels too acerbic for scum in that situation. <br><br>Actually yeah this is good. I think tojam's vote on the sb slot might have been the part of the wagon that was doing that. I need to go back and look at the timeline more closely though.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: beeboy</span>"}

The fact that the wagon stayed at l-1 or l-2 for like half a week or a week or something like that when there had been no recent posts from the slot and very little pre-existing posting (not enough to get a strong read imo) felt off. GR's posting on replacing in really didn't feel like i-just-replaced-into-a-scum-slot. His reaction to kirroha's reaction test felt genuine, and he just immediately started attacking people in every direction in a way that really didn't strike me as something that scum would do if they replaced into a wagoned slot.

If there's a scum doctor and a town jk that makes the vig oddly weak. Town doctor + town jk + 1-shot vig + town rolecop seems like a lot, although I guess it's possible if scum is strong or has roles like a tracker or a jk of their own or something like that although again jk would make the vig really weak. <br><br>On the other hand if RC is scum and there's a town doctor that seems pretty decently balanced. Town doctor synergizes nicely with the 1-shot vig because they can protect them after they're outed (especially since the jailkeeper is limited although 3 shots is a lot). There's been a recent trend (or at least it feels like it) that rolecops have been more town than scum, and it's possible RC could be trying to gain cred from confirming himself as a rolecop in this way, or making it so that he's able to kill the doctor tonight with impunity and still claim rolecop. I could imagine RC doing something like that.<br><br>Idk, I guess it could make sense either way contingent on what else we see claimed.<br><br>@Rask: I'm actually surprised how little I've drawn scum looking back. I assume the one game you found was ffery's, which to be fair is actually probably a pretty good example of me as scum. I'd imagine it'd be close to how I'd play as scum these days. I remember liking the approach I had to that game.<br><br>We're at another one of those awkward we-can't-really-do-much points in a way again, though. Nino hasn't posted for 4 and a half days, Rubixxx is replacing out. Idk. I might just wait for massclaim to finish before trying to solidify reads. But the rolecop claim is good food for thought.<br><br>RC, did you crumb? Do you have a history of crumbing when you roll PR? If no and yes, why?

It is bad he never really justified the vote though he's not justifying any of them all that much (I'll have to meta?). In isolation the vote change itself isn't bad since the wagon on you didn't seem to go anywhere and I looked more promising, but without ever explaining what the vote was for to begin with he never actually committed to it, in other words the change isn't bad itself but makes the original vote worse.<br><br>Personally I think GR himself has been mediocre, with the low commitment/wishy-washy nature, and entrance I disliked (exaggeration). His push on me I have trouble judging but it definitely makes me value his life less if he's going to make it him vs me. Since he doesn't actually say much I assume his votes on us were for our lurky/strange play which is 'valid' but he gets 0 points for insight or depth of thought for it. There's no smoking gun though and the only thing that gives me some reassurance here is townreads elsewhere plus his predecessors SB/TG's disgusting play.<br><br>Idk about your tone analysis."}

Note that the vote on me is effectively OMGUS.  And note that he leaves himself a nice little escape hatch that actually isn\u2019t true.  Beyond hope to help Town would be unwilling to move from a lynch despite the fact it leads to a No Lynch.  For example \u2013 Radiant\u2019s play Day 1 surrounding BBT who was pretty clearly Town.    I\u2019d happily lynch Kirroha today also if every is going to buy  Radiant\u2019s fake-claim.  More on that in a few lines.  But back to the escape hatch \u2013 if I do get lynched today I\u2019ll flip VT and then Radiant has already laid the groundwork to take no responsibility for yet another Town player he has pushed.  <br><br>2.  I\u2019m not going to set-up bash too much (because that is how Town loses game instead of scum-hunting) but this claim pretty much reeks of fake-claim.  Firstly it has two strong investigative shots which is pretty darn unusual for a JOAT.  A Gunsmith / Cop with maybe a Tracker / Watcher?  Much more believable.  Secondly it is tailor made to explain why scum Radient survives tonight after his claim today \u201che commuted\u201d which gets him to Day 4 to explain why he is still alive despite all his Appeal to Proficency he has been spouting about himself.  Lastly he\u2019s once again built in escape clauses to turn on either of the players he now claims are cleared in-case he needs to seal the win for his teammates (I believe scum have method to defeat me).<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7799812#p7799812\" class=\"postlink\">post 1658</a>, implosion wrote:</cite>I'm not voting magna unless there's some damn good reason.

But to answer your question \u2013 maybe.  3 Shot Jailkeep is more or less a full strength JK in a small game.  The longer the game goes the weaker it is in comparison but how often do small games go more than 4 to 5 days on Mafiascum these days?  Is a 1-Shot Vig more worthwhile than other full strength non-information roles?  Maybe, depends on use.

You are contradicting yourself.  Either scum would be more likely to fake-claim a role to draw out a Town PR / save their ass or they are not.  You can\u2019t have honestly suggest as Town you should be able to argue both sides of the discussion are valid but only for your particular analysis of the circumstances.<br><br>And I not you dodged answering why you backed off Golden when he claimed VT.  Because again \u2013 you\u2019ve diluted your own argument.  If you think Golden is Town for claiming VT under pressure why wasn\u2019t Tojam\u2019s slot for effectively doing the same thing?

Hardly \u201cearly in the game\u201d.<br><br>For the mid-part of Day 1 after the pressure comes off her she pretty much parks her vote on Shortcut and directs most of her supposed scum-hunting on that slot.  This is important to note for Day 2.  Still not attention given to any of the three potential scum she mentioned earlier (Implosion, IamI and Radiant).  In fact here are some examples of how she interacts with them Day 1 \u2013<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7653867#p7653867\" class=\"postlink\">post 380</a>, kirroha wrote:</cite>PEdit: (w.r.t. implosions post)<br>implosion I can spend an hour explaining why the heck a very badly made VT crumb+claim would make no sense coming from scum at this point in time, but I don't see the point of that right now. I think you're definitely tunneling, possibly moreso since you seem to think VTs are disposable. But just to reiterate how your theory about me being scum who just cleverly engineered this whole game doesn't make any sense:<br>-&gt; Your entire theory is based on the fact that I failed to see how obvious my crumb was, which would not have happened as scum wherein I obviously would have put the crumb before my scumbuddies to check how obvious it is; <br>-&gt; Your entire theory is also based on the fact that I claimed VT because it's the 'best claim to hide myself within a sea of townies' and save my own skin, when such a claim would have fallen apart at the merest Cop/Gunsmith check. If that was my purpose I'd have claimed Miller or Macho Townie w/ gun or something, or even Cop. VT makes no sense as a claim at this point in time, not at all tactically, and if I had scumbuddies they would have told me that. <br>-&gt; Surely if I was smart enough to do all this convoluted shit I'll have been able to avoid being scumread in the first place?</div></blockquote><br><br>Responding to a IamI request \u2013<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7653928#p7653928\" class=\"postlink\">post 386</a>, kirroha wrote:</cite>I didn't have any kind of read on Killthestory, but I get what you mean that his swap from scum!Kirroha to VI!Kirroha was way sudden and I also see no real basis for it.

Furthermore, I'm not sure why scum!Kill would want to pick a fight with an Ink/Innocent duo because I can't see what he can potentially get out of it.

I will be happy to jump on the wagon with you if I can be convinced of your reads. <br><br>Maybe it's because I've stepped away from this game for a while, but I don't feel as assertive about my reads as I originally was.

On the other hand, wagons on BBT and me happened so quickly it's ridiculous.

Either way we're playing into scum hands. That's making me iffy about lynching BBT.</div></blockquote><br><br>So once again she re-iterates that those two early fast wagons (BBT and herself) were scum driven.  And now that she dropped her \u201cInk and BBT are buddies\u201d theme BBT is Town again.  Yet as shown above she truly doesn\u2019t believe this as she doesn\u2019t pay any attention to those who would qualify as possible scum driving her and BBT.<br><br>Also note that scum bussing a buddy to lynch would be playing into scum\u2019s hands per that post?  Lol whut?<br><br>Day One ends with Kirroha having pushed the Shortcut / Golden slot as obvious scum for the bulk of the day.  Golden claims VT and suddenly  Kirroha backs off saying \u201cOh that was fast, must be Town\u201d.  I\u2019ve already addressed that an immediate back-off from the slot for a VT claim is completely inconsistent with Kirroha\u2019s stances around her crumb and implosion\u2019s crumb.  On a gut level I don\u2019t see this a Town play.<br><br>It also ends without Kirroha having questions or scum-hunted IamI, Radiant or implosion.   In fact when IamI is under pressure and self-votes to L-1 we get the following:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7681511#p7681511\" class=\"postlink\">post 1003</a>, kirroha wrote:</cite>IAI you're not getting lynched today. Please get your vote on someone else and I'll follow you.</div></blockquote><br><br>Why would Town Kirroha think this?  He as I\u2019ve pointed out fits the profile for scum who pushed both early wagons she claimed are scum driven.  Yet no questions or hunting of IamI.

Gunsmith is not that powerful role when vig is present, especially when it's only 1-shot. I don't play normals that much so I can't tell you who have used double investigative powers, but I for one likes to use double investigative JoaT (usually something like tracker/rolecop/utility variant).  Also because otherwise town is lacking an investigative power to complete the setup, I incline to believe his claim."}

Day 1 and Day 2 there was little to show how he transitioned to that read.  Yes, I understand reads do change.  But there is no thread evidence to point to why and the situation very much reads to me as possibly a case of scum-Radiant simply picking out what he perceives to be the easiest lynches for his scum-reads.  Golden was under fire Day 1 and Day 2 \u2026 being put at L-1 both days.  You can\u2019t sell me that suddenly he\u2019s a hard target.  Likewise scum Radiant has quasi-boxed himself in on GIF and Implosion (but not completely since he keeps throwing Godfather and Doctor Mafia speculation around to leave a trap-door for the future) so suddenly you are a great suspect.

But his reads so far this game have also been bad.  BBT was a terrible push and here Kill is a scum-read (which he never did any scum-hunting on BTW).  Both flipped Town Night 1.  So it is self-contradictory for him to suggest others are terrible and shouldn\u2019t be listened to because they would \u201cruin Town\u201d or \u201care scum\u201d.<br><br>Could that be ego-out-of-control bad play?  Possible.  Also possible it is scum trying to stifle dissenting voices in a game he felt was at one point easily in hand and now there is significant push-back in his ruling Town."}

Idk, looking at your general case there are a lot of things that I want to say about it but they aren't really that accurate. It feels like some of the things you're accusing her of are more personality tells, like the way that she interacted with her supposed scumreads, and some others feel like a deeper level of planning than I'd expect 3 pages into a game. Some of them are pretty good points. I think the thing that gives me most pause on review is the play around the gr vt claim. It does feel somewhat abrupt, or like she took the now-active replacement as an excuse to not have to actually go through with the bus. But the vt claim still feels town at a gut level.

Seriously do a side-by side of Implosion and Kirroha.   Minimal interaction between the slots at all.  The most telling is Implosion\u2019s jump onto Kirroha\u2019s early wagon and this interaction regarding Kirroha\u2019s softclaim.  That\u2019s it.  Once the heat died down on Kirroha no scum-hunting interactions between the slots at all.  Some minor banter.

You may disagree but Implosion / GiF absolutely have to be left for last.  A scum lynch that flips Mafia Doctor more or less seals the game for Town via PoE.

I don't get the IAI one that close to deadline considering TJ had votes on him; she went into deadline not going back to TJ until the deadline was already passed; the thread was locked late since mod was afk. If I was in her pos I wouldn't have stopped voting TJ (her #1 scumread that day) when he was a potential lynch for deadline, and I would either be for or against the TG/GR lynch. If against it I'd tell people why he's town and try to redirect, if for it I'd obviously vote and stay and try to push it.

Syn does vote GR though GR goes off of syn to 'compromise' with a lynch on me.<br>Syn doesn't really push it and GR pushes it while voting me. As syn/gr get more scumread and it looks like one of the two will be lynched anyways they actually interact and start casing each other.<br>I think at that point it's day 3 and they're both scumread and thinking one will be lynched anyways they bus like this so whichever one survives looks good. I also respect RC's opinion on this when he says he saw it as a bussing interaction (considering he lynched GR). I think it's also a characteristic of bussing to act really convinced in it more-so than town usually is, and particularly for syndesis who's been wishy-washy af for everthing else this game I don't really buy it.<br><br>In general aside from the posts d3 on GR which are different from all her others, it's low content and there's nothing that I can actually look at and say that's a reasoned, nuanced town perspective. Everyone else at least has their moments but apart from the GR syn thing which I think is bussing and constructed I don't see her having done scumhunting. Even if you don't see it as a bus can you give me a reason you're townreading her?"}

(i.e. Syndesis)<br>- People who seem to like my wagon but don't vote for me tend to be scum. (Shortcut?)<br><br>Because of this I don't particularly like how Syndesis and Shortcut are looking right now. Syndesis has only posted 2 posts so far, which are essentially \"Hi, so many posts to read through lol\" and then voting me with no explanation. <br><br>Shortcut has been relatively active but flitting in here and there and not making any reads.

I think overall this relationship is most likely scum Imp hard-buddying town-moi's slot using the rubixxx emotion as an excuse. Mostly the imp/moi review just makes me feel even worse about impl individually though. Particularly feel like he's prepared gif/me as a push for later back in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7831932#p7831932\">1844</a> <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7859516#p7859516\">1907</a>.<br><br>In practice this means syn lynch &gt;&gt;&gt; imp lynch today, the only scenario in which imp is better being if I misread syn AND one of MoI/GiF, which I really doubt after being right on kirro.<br>If it's syn/imp as it probably is the order here is irrelevant though.<br><br>As for actual syn/imp interaction, Syn ISO doesn't have much content for associations, there's a weak tonal tr on imp and that's pretty much it. Implosion for most of the game had no actual scumreads (cited lack of motivation) but when he went into it he had syn as \"scummy but less scummy than rask\" if you take near bottom of his list to mean scummy; he actually phrased it as being the weakest townreads amongst townreading everyone lol. See my earlier post on scum having scum around that near-bottom-but-never-quite category. Until the GR flip, at which point he starts to townread syn and says it isn't bussing, didn't he second-guess even a bit unlike everyone else who at least considered what I said about it. Honestly no smoking guns via interaction, but no evidence against the association plus both being individually scummy plus townreads elsewhere and other teams looking unlikely makes me fairly convinced on this.<br><br>I'm better still on the GiF slot with an ink re-read though I didn't like ink way back when for some reason. With GiF/imp and GiF/Moi out the only thing possible is syn/GiF which is a bad association considering syn's push on ink d2 (bussing 1 partner is ok but bussing both seems ludicrous). I wish GiF himself was more involved in this game though.<br><br>The only thing I'm slightly paranoid of is MoI almost entirely from the day 3 play discrediting RC and the kirro read feeling disproportionally based on her VT crumb and ideas, but logically I know that everyone accepting kirro yesterday means both other town were wrong there too, and if I have to find the person who looked the most convinced-yet-wrong-anyways as opposed to straight up lazy and settling (the latter blends in with scum) it would be him.<br><br>But yeah 90% it's syn/imp and going to vote syn unless anyone objects."}

If I was syndesis as town scumreading me I would feel better than she did to take that 1 for 1 especially if it was me first, furthermore if she was town I'd expect at least one of the actual scum to support it as well because it's basically a free win for them setting up an easy lylo ml on either. This scenario has 3 people with some motivation to support it and I'd expect at least 1/3 to bite; town rejecting being traded for their #1 scumread is believable but combined with both of the scum being against the narrative as well I feel is really unlikely. Even if you're town and you hate the concept: when you're in a scenario where you want your scumread lynched and the lynch instead is someone you're settling on (syn said she thought scum was me+GiF), I think you'd at least consider it or just be a little bit or mildy opposed. She talked to me when I suggested it as if I was being stupid when she should have instead seen it as malicious or scum-motivated from a town pov talking to their scumread. I would have also wanted a town syn to push me with more conviction especially after being 'right' about GR; though this is a more minor thing.<br>I also think scum should have also setup suspicion onto syn if she was town as well for next-day preparation when it looked like my lynch was most likely; playing both sides of a TvT and using it to get both seems like optimal scumplay in that scenario. Looking back I do see this thinking used on me and kirroha but the only person I remember using it for me+syn (I see 1 scum in the two and this statement allows me to get the other tomorrow if one is ml'd) is MoI but him having that perspective as town considering the gs innos makes perfect sense; think about it.<br><br>I'm actually surprised though, I didn't think I would get this much information from analysing and thinking about it but it sort of became an accidental reaction test. I was mostly just desperate from that shitty situation and wanted it not to be an insta-loss if I got lynched since I was/am pretty damn sure on my syn read: 1 for 1 with potential for 1 for 0 is essentially win-mostlywin. I think me being lynched there would have been instaloss in retrospect because kirroha probably would've been lynched the following lylo, or even the one after that if people pulled through. As it is I think we'll be okay surprisingly unless I'm horrendously wrong after all my research, which has happened before (x_x), or if MoI soft-180s."}

I care about figuring out which of the three of you is scum (or which two) so that we can not-lose the game today.

I analyzed things as the game went on. I re-analyzed them yesterday. At some point it feels like looking at the same material too many times does more harm than good. Especially given that that's essentially why I don't have any strong reads right now. I've basically second-guessed everything that I've thought throughout this game. I was really, really confident rubixx's slot and synd were town based on their play and interactions with gr, and your recent actions probably aren't on par with the degree to which I saw their actions/relations as townish but because of recency they're more at the front of my mind. <br><br>I've explained both of those townreads in pretty high depth throughout this game I think. Rubixxx made posts that I don't think would have been faked. Gr interacted with synd in a way that I don't think would have happened if they were both scum. With regards to 2020 like I said it's just overly simplistic. It's overlys implistic because assumes synd-town would be so confident in her read on you so as to stake the game. After you offered the 1 for 1 synd described you as \"probably scum?\" and I would hardly expect town with that stance to want to take an offer of a 1-for-1. It's overly simplistic because it assumes scum will just go for that kind of thing. Scum aren't going to \"accept\" or \"go for\" a 1-for-1 offer because that doesn't mean that it happens. That can look scummy to do. Like, most of the time that that kind of thing happens from town it's so that analysis like you gave in 2020 can be given and at that point you'd be calling anyone who jumped on scum and scum would know that. If you and synd are both town then it really isn't surprising at all that no one jumped on to that idea because it's not like as soon as people agree the 1-for-1 trade becomes sacredly ensrhined in gold with no takesies-backsies. It's not like scum can just say \"okay guys we did it the two townies are 1 for 1ing, we win, lets vote them.\" Because that's not how the dynamic nature of a mafia game works."}

Which I have.</div></blockquote><br>Okay that was probably an exaggeration; I think it's about the same if you're only talking about GiF (not ink). When I say presence I mean impact on the game; GiF in his short time got us to massclaim, developed reads and defended his townread on me preventing that wagon, whereas it feels like you've been completely static with no scumreads since about day 3 and I'll admit I'm biased towards the former. Comparing slots as a whole is a different story because of ink's play, and if I were to ignore that it'd be a lot harder to judge but as is I like the overall slot way more. As it is it's pretty irrelevant since we have to lynch outside the innos today and I only want syn, and at this point I'm not sure if it'll go to day six anyways.<br><br>Idk, call me crazy but I feel like I have some obligation to win this even if nobody else cares; dragging what's left of the game to the finish line if I have to. Naturally if I'm wrong it'll suck but regardless of the outcome I wouldn't feel comfortable with myself if I wasn't putting all my effort into it. There's nothing you can learn from a game if you didn't even try and I personally would sooner replace out of a game than give up but stay anyways, but again I think you're way more likely just scum feeling good/complacent about your chances to win lylo either today or tomorrow with this \"I'm town with no motivation\" shtick. I'll give it to you, it's decent play considering the site meta because I usually see scum favour excuses and defend their apathy rather than straight up admitting they have a screwed pov + they don't care and probably won't in future; you went about half-and-half here with 2032 being the former and elsewhere the latter."}

As examples -<br><br>Synd asked ShortCut a question at <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7646489#p7646489\">200</a>.  ShortCut was absent for an extended amount of time and when ShortCut did return Synd again asked reminded SCB of the question.  Aside from that nada either way.  And Synd only moves to pressure that slot after ShortCut's replace at with <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7661425#p7661425\">553</a> which assesses \u201cyour predecessor was too terrible\u201d.   Yet Synd had minimal interactions with the slot before that and really never mentioned SCB as scummy in any signficant way.  Reads as possible bussing.<br><br>I also dislike his hop onto the Tojam wagon off of Robster's slot.  Tojam had only 5 posts before Synd made his change moved to the Robster slot wagon.  So Synd goes from voting the Robster slot to voting someone who joined them on said wagon.  I can see this as a possible bussing partner who saw the chance to move to a non-partner lynch on another low content target.<br><br>After Golden replaces in the Synd - Golden interactions are very, very soft the rest of Day 1 and Day 2.  Robster on multiple occasions calls out Synd for scummy actions (example in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7677024#p7677024\">800</a> but doesn't make any effort to pressure or vote Synd.  This happens multiple times including posts in the 1000s and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7718321#p7718321\">1122</a>.  In summary those days Synd was always in the bottom of Golden's rankings as to who was scum but there was never any action to follow up on those claims.<br><br>Synd's read on Golden doesn't seem very organic to me.   He mentions Golden is a Null read at <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7735378#p7735378\">1277</a>.  Then about 60 posts later at <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7748483#p7748483\">1332</a> Golden is now a probably Town read yet there is nothing between there where Synd interacts with Golden and Golden continues to softly call Synd scum.  I can see this as scum unwilling to commit to a counter-bus when the Beeboy slot was around to mislynch.<br><br>Probably the most damning part of the Day 2 exchange is <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7737569#p7737569\">1285</a> by Robster.  Here Robster is trying to link Synd to GiF for the sin of \"calling each other scum without interacting with each other\" but that is in a nutshelll the treatment Robster's slot has laid on Synd - softly calling him scum while not interacting with him or trying to vote Synd.<br><br>Day 3 could be cross-bussing.  The snipe back and forth at each other but Golden is happy to move to a Rask compromise lynch despite having a supposed strong scum read on Synd and Synd now moving Robster to a scum read.<br><br>Overall I could see them as partners who got desperate due to Radiant's push on them Day 3 who decided to cross-bus in hopes that one would escape unscathed after the fact.<br><br>Certainly not sold 100% but within the realm of possibility.<br><br>Next up - review of Rask and the Golden slot."}

ShortCut has very limited interactions with Rask.  <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7659727#p7659727\">505</a> is the closest they get to anything game related and that is very, very soft interactions.  In fact I find it bordering on coaching from Rask to ShortCut \"Hey just make this Townie style post and you can get some of the heat off you\".  Although in a Daytalk game that really doesn't probably hold much weight.  Still ... it just is odd.<br><br>I think given Rask's penchant for pointing out Rule of Three posting that <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7660919#p7660919\">546</a> actually fits that pattern - we have ShortCut mixed in with a group of 3 Town players.<br><br>The vote on Robster's slot at <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7676890#p7676890\">785</a> comes out of left field.  No suspicion posted their way just a hop onto a wagon with the reasoning \"my wagon on BBT (Town) isn't viable\".<br><br>Another point against Rask is that at <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7658004#p7658004\">451</a> she made a show of stating that pushing for claims was a bad idea Day 1 or Day 2.  Yet she is willing to bounce around to multiple wagons at the end of day (IAI, BBT, Golden) which basically generated at least 2 more claims than Kirrohas' VT claim and Kill's Jailkeep claim.  Reads as posturing to me as opposed to actual Town thinking.<br><br>The Day 2 interactions with Robster really aren't more indicative of Town trying to read scum.  Rask really never does much to establish a scum-read on Golden via interactions.  And Golden plays with the concept of suspecting Rask but keeps pushing it off to \"another Day\".<br><br>Very much don't like <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7768668#p7768668\">1511</a> <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7768710#p7768710\">1512</a>.  If Synd is Town then this very much reads of indecisive bussing on Rask's part.<br><br>By the time Day 3 rolls around the interactions between the slots don't really deepen much.  They take turns voting each other and then backing off to another player without any questioning or scum-hunting backing up the movement.  And having re-read Rask's play around my entry I really, really dislike it.  Re-readiing the PoE again leaves a very bad taste in my mouth.  I can certainly see scum willing to bus (Robster) but happy to lump three Town in the \"must lynch\" pool and being willing to vote anyone there at a drop of a hat."}

Why do you think you have been \"on point most of  game\"?  The only possible scum you bounced around on Day 1 was Robster (BBT was Town as was IAI and Tojam) and your push on that slot was basically non-existent Day 1.  You participated in the Beeboy mislynch Day 2.   Only 1 scum has been lynched so far Day 3 and guess what - all three of Synd, myself and yourself were on the wagon.  So I don't see how your reads are so spot on and you are so frustrated when you aren't statistically any better than any other living player.  You only pushed Synd yesterday and if Kirroha getting lynched in his place is the source of all this rage then I'm not sure what to tell you.<br><br>Frankly this is a hot button issue for me because I see far too much crowing on the site since my return about how much better people's reads are than everyone else.

The way that he talks to rask in the 1260s also feels off, the way that he talks about rask progressing from 1253 to them. It feels like he's still testing the waters to a degree but doesn't want to commit to a second bus.

It's really the biggest thing that's been sapping my motivation because of how I look at games.

The only thing that is important is that both Implosion and yourself have Gunsmith clears on you so only one of the two of you can possibly be scum.

KTS, RC and Dwlee all almost certainly died because they were claimed PRs. As MoI mentioned BBT was a vig shot. That leaves IAI as the only nightkill that can really meaningfully be speculated. Looking at his ISO, IAI did suspect me; he also suspected rask and called syn town. He didn't really discuss those suspicions much on day two because neither of them were under pressure. You're hilariously mischaracterizing this game if you look at the nightkills and think it's relevant that each of them suspected at least one of the two of us. Even that statement is just so weak, that every townie killed at night suspected at least one of two people. I don't really feel like doing the work for it right now but it's almost certainly true for plenty of pairs of people in any given game just statistically. This line of reasoning both distills the opinions of people that have died into \"did they suspect at least one of these two people\" which both ignores their read on the other (in this case, IAI having read syn as town) and assumes baselessly that the reason they were killed was for their reads (which almost certainly isn't true of anyone but IAI, and still can't be safely assumed for him as there are a ton of different possible reasons for someone to be NK'd). <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Virtue wrote:</cite>Syn and Implosion have some explaining to do regarding why this GR wagon folded.</div></blockquote><br>I mean, I unvoted because the slot was essentially afk and I didn't feel like I had enough information on it to be confident. I don't know what the high-level reason is why the wagon died. Probably largely because of the reason I unvoted. As I've said several times this game has often been defined by the people that are absent. When GR replaced in I thought his immediate posting looked town. I have no idea what you mean by \"we have some explaining to do.\" I'm not accountable for why a wagon died, I'm accountable for my own actions in this game, and I thought the shortcut/taisho wagon looked increasingly bad as time went on and people stayed on it despite a lack of a replacement. I was wrong.<br><br>Virtue is reinforcing my scumread on his slot with these arguments. They're so flimsy in terms of the reasoning behind them and yet he's throwing them out as if they aren't. Granted he's said he's listening for \"good answers\" but those are not good questions. The fact that he looked through NK history and specifically singled out that everyone who died suspected either me or syn makes me think pretty strongly that he was looking for reasons to be able to call me+synd scum, rather than looking for who is scum from a neutral baseline."}

When I got my role PM I was excited for a role I hadn't been before but being fake-innoed as a traitor kind of sucks. I had no strong motivation to look town anymore because my lynch was off the table and I couldn't win the game on my own. Ostensibly my only imperative was to make Synd look town and it's not really fun playing in that way of only caring how someone else is perceived. It also isn't fun being more or less forced into a specific tactic because nothing else benefitted my cause (obviously I had no reason whatsoever to bus after GR flipped and only nominal motivation if that before). <br><br>Regardless of that, gg.<br><br>I am actually ironically probably the most curious about the scum PT because I'm curious how obviously I was the traitor to scum &lt;_&lt;</div></blockquote><br>I can't even imagine how difficult it must be to play traitor and I think the way things panned out you were stuck in a very awkward position (I said this in the PT but bussing GR was approximately the stupidest decision in my life).
