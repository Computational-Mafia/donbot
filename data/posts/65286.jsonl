That and the fact that he misrepresented my post. <br>\n<br>\nThough, ink, for someone who's been digging into my past games, you must've realised that the last game I've played was in early 2014, when there was only nighttalk. My so-called \"fake townslip question\" you are eyeing is genuine. In my first game I was also lynched for an alleged 'fake townslip'. I was VT.

I just usually ask questions and lightly pressure people early in the game to see reactions and gather information) is that after a while I tend to see patterns about my wagon. <br>\n<br>\nA few things I've noticed henceforth were these: <br>\n- The people spearheading my wagon with reasons of their own tend to be town. <br>\n- The people who defend me tend to be town as well. <br>\n- People who sit on my wagon without a definite reason tend to be scum. (i.e. Syndesis)<br>\n- People who seem to like my wagon but don't vote for me tend to be scum. (Shortcut?)<br>\n<br>\nBecause of this I don't particularly like how Syndesis and Shortcut are looking right now. Syndesis has only posted 2 posts so far, which are essentially \"Hi, so many posts to read through lol\" and then voting me with no explanation. <br>\n<br>\nShortcut has been relatively active but flitting in here and there and not making any reads.

And if you think BBT is also scum, then you will keep voting BBT, because it is better to get the more aggressive scum lynched.</div></blockquote><br>\nNope, I don't find Innocent scummy because you don't need a reason to supply a vote, you need a reason to supply a lynch. This is still somewhat RVS, and I'm damn sure that plenty of others have placed down no reason votes. Why does Innocent strike you off when it's a common thing, especially with the use of gutreads on this site?<br>\n<br>\nI'll post more in a second, but I need to take some medicine", "time": "Tue Feb 09, 2016 12:48 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=65286&start=150", "forum": "53", "thread": "65286"}

I stated quite clearly that my crumb is in plain sight, but is impossible to figure out unless you know the language. I have deliberately also made it a crumb that isn't Google Translateable either, so that nobody will be able to tell what it is until I have to explain the crumb myself. Essentially, the crumb will only make sense after I am forced to claim. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">This is so there is no way my crumb or the fact that I have a crumb would give any kind of extra information to scum.</div> Instead, it is a way for me to inform the rest of the town that I had a <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">consistent</div> role from the beginning, something which scum is unlikely to have. It doesn't necessarily mean a PR softclaim. I could've crumbed \"vanilla townie\" for all you know. <br>\n<br>\nSo I don't get your argument in that it isn't a legitimate action for me to take as town. <br>\n<br>\n@Regarding me as a 2009 player: I just need to clear it up that I have only played 4 games on this site so far - 2 in 2009 and 1 in 2014. In all of them, I was either lynched early, or the game ended early for any other reason. While I'm not trying to excuse being a tentative or bad player, I hope you can consider this fact before anyone points out the fact that I don't play very well as being scummy because \"if I'm town I would be better at this since I'm a 2009 player\". <br>\n<br>\nAnyway, Shortcut's latest posts are extremely scummy.

How friendly or silly or jokey a player is depends quite a lot on how well they know the people around here.

One, I probably should have said crumbed instead of softclaimed (I occasionally use them interchangeably which I shouldn't, but etc). Two, mine isn't wrong. And since it's integral to why Kirroha is scum let me just say it (since, again, scum will be able to figure it out anyway since I have): Kirroha has, in fact, breadcrumbed vanilla town in post 107: \"xiang'cao'nong'min.\" It's a transliteration (pinyin) of Chinese for \"vanilla peasant\" (at least according to the internet).<br>\n<br>\nAnd to preempt the \"lolol implosion is rolefishing\" argument because SOMEONE is going to make it: (1) her crumbing vanilla townie is the main reason I think she's scum and (2) scum will be able to figure this out anyway; I'm just opening it up so that the town can discuss it too.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I stated quite clearly that my crumb is in plain sight, but is impossible to figure out unless you know the language.</div></blockquote><br>\nI don't know the language (I took Chinese in high school over 4 years ago and remember ostensibly nothing); I just recognized what it was and then googled for it. Google translate can't but there are other sites that can translate from pinyin to English. Google translate also gives pinyin. It's not hard to put the relatively few normal roles into google translate and see which ones give what you said.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I have deliberately also made it a crumb that isn't Google Translateable either, so that nobody will be able to tell what it is until I have to explain the crumb myself. Essentially, the crumb will only make sense after I am forced to claim.</div></blockquote><br>\nThere are essentially two things that could be going on here. Either Kirroha is scum and is lying about this (relatively unlikely) or Kirroha is telling the truth that she thought the crumb wasn't decipherable. If it's the latter then it makes plenty of sense as a scum strategy: you can kill the momentum on your wagon without having to commit to claiming anything risky, since it's a vt breadcrumb. I can sort of see the motivation for this as town but it seems way less likely, especially since Kirroha has dropped hint after hint after hint to what she's softclaiming; as scum she wouldn't necessarily care if it got out that she was claiming vt (it doesn't necessarily harm scum) but as town it is harmful for her to be known as a vt (gives scum more info on who to nk). <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">This is so there is no way my crumb or the fact that I have a crumb would give any kind of extra information to scum.</div> Instead, it is a way for me to inform the rest of the town that I had a <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">consistent</div> role from the beginning, something which scum is unlikely to have. It doesn't necessarily mean a PR softclaim. I could've crumbed \"vanilla townie\" for all you know. </div></blockquote><br>\nAgain, having a \"consistent\" role from the beginning is not hard as scum when that role is vanilla townie. Also note that she seems to be backhandedly implying that crumbing vt is something very town-ish to do (which it isn't) by comparing it with this idea of having a consistent role.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>@Regarding me as a 2009 player: I just need to clear it up that I have only played 4 games on this site so far - 2 in 2009 and 1 in 2014. In all of them, I was either lynched early, or the game ended early for any other reason. While I'm not trying to excuse being a tentative or bad player, I hope you can consider this fact before anyone points out the fact that I don't play very well as being scummy because \"if I'm town I would be better at this since I'm a 2009 player\". </div></blockquote><br>\nFair enough, but the read of you as competent is more based on you making cogent arguments and the fact that you're arguing from past experience than your join date.

I mean, not as a person, but as a player. He's got literally only 12 posts and we're on our 20th-ish page! I don't get why everyone is letting him skirt by unchecked, but I ain't having that shit. <br>\n<br>\n2) Ink (scum as fuck)<br>\nShortcut is no longer around, so I'm going to give that slot a blank slate until they post enough to warrant suspicion. So I'm thinking this fucker is the caboose on this mantrain of scumfuckery. What was eir reason for wanting me lynched again? Me making you guys wait for my reads, me raging at Kill la Kill (which happened like 10 pages again - try harder, fool), and me bugging RC... lol wat? And I thought you were scumreading Killz just a few posts ago? But okay, sheeping BBT is easier than putting your own neck on the line and possibly getting lynched once I flip. Fucking noted.<br>\n<br>\n3) Raskolnikov (scummy)<br>\nSparse posting. Never really seems to say anything. I don't trust it. <br>\n<br>\n4) I Am Innocent (scum-ish)<br>\nHow the literal fuck is me not voting within a two day period a scumtell? Seriously, how. Not to mention the weird stuff you pulled with Kirroha's wagon. The only reason you're not higher on my scum-o-meter is because you tend to be unafraid of starting wagons, even if it's for reasons I think is silly.<br>\n<br>\n5) Implosion (scum-ish)<br>\nImo, this person tends to slip under the radar, and seems really swingy - case in point being the Kirroha wagon. But at the same time, it could just be really bad town play. Iunno.<br>\n<br>\n6) RadiantCowbells (null/scum-ish)<br>\nI have no idea what this guy is even doing. I'm familiar enough with his reputation to think it's probably just his style, but I'm not super convinced that's all there is to it. He said he generally doesn't play games as town because he usually gets NKed. The fact that he hasn't replaced out might mean he's scum trying to throw us off the trail by saying that and using it as an excuse to not have to elaborate on him voting off townies... maybe? Idk. Itvs very WIFOM so I'll stop with that train of thought. My tiny peanut brain cannot handle.<br>\n<br>\n7) Taisho (null)<br>\nNothing much to go off of yet, but it's worth mentioning that I was really suspicious of the first person in this slot.<br>\n<br>\n8) Syndesis (null-townish)<br>\nAvant garde play tends to read town for me since scum will usually make sure all their arguments hold under scrutiny. Her declining to elaborate on some of her reads doesn't seem like something scum would do.<br>\n<br>\n9) BBT (null/town-ish) <br>\nAs annoyed as I am that BBT voted me for bullshit reasons (really? You think I'm trying to imitate my town play as scum? Reeeeally?) I don't think it's alignment indicative. I feel like scum is jumping on the wagon he started for a free easy turbo-lynch, but that's it. I'm not too worried about his bouts of inactivity and promises to catch up later. He did that in my last game, too, and he was town. It might just be his style. Meatworld can be a bitch sometimes. So it could be that, too. <br>\n<br>\n10) Kill la Kill (town-ish)<br>\nAgain, being confrontational tends to read town to me, and this person is as good as they come when it comes to shit talking. So town for now.<br>\n<br>\n11) Nico (towny)<br>\nI was originally weirded out by her reverence for Radiant, but I'm cool with it now. Her scum hunting seems real legit. I also liked her defense of Kirroha.<br>\n<br>\n12) Kirroha (town as fuck)<br>\nThis is the general concensus, and I honestly see no reason to challenge it.", "time": "Mon Feb 15, 2016 6:41 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=65286&start=525", "forum": "53", "thread": "65286"}

BBT thinks I'm scum because he believes I'm \"\"\"immitating\"\"\" my earlier town-tell. I find it interesting that he failed to mention, however, that for most of that game, I was playing a CHARACTER. All that anger had been slowly building up because I wanted to be consistant and not drop character. At the moment of my ragesplosion, all that fell away and I was MYSELF again. How I acted in that one moment is generally how I act as a default. I'm not imitating an earlier town-tell, because the town tell in question was ME BEING MYSELF.<br>\n<br>\nBut okay whatever if you want to continue this little circle jerk if idiocy, be my guest.

I know MY alignment, so I judge everyone by how they react to me. If I think there's town-motivated reasons for pushing my wagon, I try to convince them otherwise, but don't necessarily think of them as scum for it.

Idk, I haven't put a ton of thought into him since the claim. When someone makes a pr claim on d1, unless I have a very strong scumread on them (and I can only think of one game that fits that category), I more or less file them into the back of my head until later. I guess it's inaccurate to say that I think he's the least likely scum on your wagon (or a particularly unlikely one). More so that the claim will likely help resolve itself to some degree. Basically every night he doesn't die makes him more likely scum. Even given that I suspect he'll probably die tonight if he's town. <br>\n<br>\nEssentially I feel like I don't have to think about kts right now.

He's one of my weaker townreads.<br>\n<br>\nGR is a strong townread. Of the d1 wagons the sb one felt the most to me like it had characteristics of a mislynch being pushed by scum. I thought SB's posting was moderately bad but the way the wagon stagnated/stayed very large after he disappeared felt scum-driven. The fact that the wagon stayed at l-1 or l-2 for like half a week or a week or something like that when there had been no recent posts from the slot and very little pre-existing posting (not enough to get a strong read imo) felt off. GR's posting on replacing in really didn't feel like i-just-replaced-into-a-scum-slot. His reaction to kirroha's reaction test felt genuine, and he just immediately started attacking people in every direction in a way that really didn't strike me as something that scum would do if they replaced into a wagoned slot. It feels too acerbic for scum in that situation. <br>\n<br>\nActually yeah this is good. I think tojam's vote on the sb slot might have been the part of the wagon that was doing that.

The fact that the wagon stayed at l-1 or l-2 for like half a week or a week or something like that when there had been no recent posts from the slot and very little pre-existing posting (not enough to get a strong read imo) felt off.

{"number": 1534, "id": "7769629", "user": "implosion", "user_id": "14368", "content": "Yeah... mafia doctor and town doctor both make very very little sense (assuming RC is town and not BSing). If there's a scum doctor and a town jk that makes the vig oddly weak. Town doctor + town jk + 1-shot vig + town rolecop seems like a lot, although I guess it's possible if scum is strong or has roles like a tracker or a jk of their own or something like that although again jk would make the vig really weak. <br>\n<br>\nOn the other hand if RC is scum and there's a town doctor that seems pretty decently balanced. Town doctor synergizes nicely with the 1-shot vig because they can protect them after they're outed (especially since the jailkeeper is limited although 3 shots is a lot). There's been a recent trend (or at least it feels like it) that rolecops have been more town than scum, and it's possible RC could be trying to gain cred from confirming himself as a rolecop in this way, or making it so that he's able to kill the doctor tonight with impunity and still claim rolecop. I could imagine RC doing something like that.<br>\n<br>\nIdk, I guess it could make sense either way contingent on what else we see claimed.<br>\n<br>\n@Rask: I'm actually surprised how little I've drawn scum looking back. I assume the one game you found was ffery's, which to be fair is actually probably a pretty good example of me as scum. I'd imagine it'd be close to how I'd play as scum these days. I remember liking the approach I had to that game.<br>\n<br>\nWe're at another one of those awkward we-can't-really-do-much points in a way again, though. Nino hasn't posted for 4 and a half days, Rubixxx is replacing out. Idk. I might just wait for massclaim to finish before trying to solidify reads. But the rolecop claim is good food for thought.<br>\n<br>\nRC, did you crumb? Do you have a history of crumbing when you roll PR? If no and yes, why? You strike me as the kind of player who would although idk if you would just not because you die early a lot.", "time": "Mon Mar 21, 2016 10:27 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=65286&start=1525", "forum": "53", "thread": "65286"}

It is bad he never really justified the vote though he's not justifying any of them all that much (I'll have to meta?). In isolation the vote change itself isn't bad since the wagon on you didn't seem to go anywhere and I looked more promising, but without ever explaining what the vote was for to begin with he never actually committed to it, in other words the change isn't bad itself but makes the original vote worse.<br>\n<br>\nPersonally I think GR himself has been mediocre, with the low commitment/wishy-washy nature, and entrance I disliked (exaggeration). His push on me I have trouble judging but it definitely makes me value his life less if he's going to make it him vs me. Since he doesn't actually say much I assume his votes on us were for our lurky/strange play which is 'valid' but he gets 0 points for insight or depth of thought for it.

And note that he leaves himself a nice little escape hatch that actually isn&#8217;t true.  Beyond hope to help Town would be unwilling to move from a lynch despite the fact it leads to a No Lynch.  For example &#8211; Radiant&#8217;s play Day 1 surrounding BBT who was pretty clearly Town.    I&#8217;d happily lynch Kirroha today also if every is going to buy  Radiant&#8217;s fake-claim.  More on that in a few lines.  But back to the escape hatch &#8211; if I do get lynched today I&#8217;ll flip VT and then Radiant has already laid the groundwork to take no responsibility for yet another Town player he has pushed.  <br>\n<br>\n2.  I&#8217;m not going to set-up bash too much (because that is how Town loses game instead of scum-hunting) but this claim pretty much reeks of fake-claim.  Firstly it has two strong investigative shots which is pretty darn unusual for a JOAT.  A Gunsmith / Cop with maybe a Tracker / Watcher?  Much more believable.  Secondly it is tailor made to explain why scum Radient survives tonight after his claim today &#8220;he commuted&#8221; which gets him to Day 4 to explain why he is still alive despite all his Appeal to Proficency he has been spouting about himself.  Lastly he&#8217;s once again built in escape clauses to turn on either of the players he now claims are cleared in-case he needs to seal the win for his teammates (I believe scum have method to defeat me).<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7799812#p7799812\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7799812#p7799812\" data-post-id=\"7799812\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 1658</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=14368\">implosion</a> wrote:</cite>I'm not voting magna unless there's some damn good reason.

Either way we're playing into scum hands. That's making me iffy about lynching BBT.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nSo once again she re-iterates that those two early fast wagons (BBT and herself) were scum driven.  And now that she dropped her &#8220;Ink and BBT are buddies&#8221; theme BBT is Town again.  Yet as shown above she truly doesn&#8217;t believe this as she doesn&#8217;t pay any attention to those who would qualify as possible scum driving her and BBT.<br>\n<br>\nAlso note that scum bussing a buddy to lynch would be playing into scum&#8217;s hands per that post?  Lol whut?<br>\n<br>\nDay One ends with Kirroha having pushed the Shortcut / Golden slot as obvious scum for the bulk of the day.  Golden claims VT and suddenly  Kirroha backs off saying &#8220;Oh that was fast, must be Town&#8221;.  I&#8217;ve already addressed that an immediate back-off from the slot for a VT claim is completely inconsistent with Kirroha&#8217;s stances around her crumb and implosion&#8217;s crumb.  On a gut level I don&#8217;t see this a Town play.<br>\n<br>\nIt also ends without Kirroha having questions or scum-hunted IamI, Radiant or implosion.   In fact when IamI is under pressure and self-votes to L-1 we get the following:<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7681511#p7681511\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7681511#p7681511\" data-post-id=\"7681511\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 1003</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=11008\">kirroha</a> wrote:</cite>IAI you're not getting lynched today.

He as I&#8217;ve pointed out fits the profile for scum who pushed both early wagons she claimed are scum driven.  Yet no questions or hunting of IamI.

Day 1 and Day 2 there was little to show how he transitioned to that read.  Yes, I understand reads do change.  But there is no thread evidence to point to why and the situation very much reads to me as possibly a case of scum-Radiant simply picking out what he perceives to be the easiest lynches for his scum-reads.  Golden was under fire Day 1 and Day 2 &#8230; being put at L-1 both days.  You can&#8217;t sell me that suddenly he&#8217;s a hard target.  Likewise scum Radiant has quasi-boxed himself in on GIF and Implosion (but not completely since he keeps throwing Godfather and Doctor Mafia speculation around to leave a trap-door for the future) so suddenly you are a great suspect.

Idk, looking at your general case there are a lot of things that I want to say about it but they aren't really that accurate.

Some of them are pretty good points. I think the thing that gives me most pause on review is the play around the gr vt claim.

I also respect RC's opinion on this when he says he saw it as a bussing interaction (considering he lynched GR). I think it's also a characteristic of bussing to act really convinced in it more-so than town usually is, and particularly for syndesis who's been wishy-washy af for everthing else this game I don't really buy it.<br>\n<br>\nIn general aside from the posts d3 on GR which are different from all her others, it's low content and there's nothing that I can actually look at and say that's a reasoned, nuanced town perspective. Everyone else at least has their moments but apart from the GR syn thing which I think is bussing and constructed I don't see her having done scumhunting.

That and the fact that he misrepresented my post. <br>\n<br>\nThough, ink, for someone who's been digging into my past games, you must've realised that the last game I've played was in early 2014, when there was only nighttalk. My so-called \"fake townslip question\" you are eyeing is genuine. In my first game I was also lynched for an alleged 'fake townslip'. I was VT. Maybe I'm just a shitty player, but because of that being accused of fake townslips just aggravates me. But anyways, I'm more interested in talking about this:<br>\n<br>\nOne silver lining about being the usual D1/D2 town lynch (which, sad to say, I still have no idea why it keeps happening. I just usually ask questions and lightly pressure people early in the game to see reactions and gather information) is that after a while I tend to see patterns about my wagon. <br>\n<br>\nA few things I've noticed henceforth were these: <br>\n- The people spearheading my wagon with reasons of their own tend to be town. <br>\n- The people who defend me tend to be town as well. <br>\n- People who sit on my wagon without a definite reason tend to be scum. (i.e. Syndesis)<br>\n- People who seem to like my wagon but don't vote for me tend to be scum. (Shortcut?)<br>\n<br>\nBecause of this I don't particularly like how Syndesis and Shortcut are looking right now. Syndesis has only posted 2 posts so far, which are essentially \"Hi, so many posts to read through lol\" and then voting me with no explanation. <br>\n<br>\nShortcut has been relatively active but flitting in here and there and not making any reads. The fact that his vote is still on Nino even though he seems to have more likely candidates by now bothers me.<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Syndesis</span><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">FOS: Shortcut</div><br>\n<br>\nIf you have to lynch me D1, pay attention to my wagon after I flip.

I've lost my last two lylos and I'll be salty af if this goes the same way.<br>\n<br>\nAnyways, I'm fairly confident in my MoI read from our talk yesterday and particularly feel that he was genuinely convinced kirro would flip scum. Things like the analysis in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7861750#p7861750\">1915</a> seems to be pushing the partner narrative too far considering scum-MoI would know it's useless because kirro was town, and scum generally push theories this far if they have actual value for later; i.e. it's inefficient to setup a ton of kirroha-imp scumteam theorycrafting if as scum you know it's useless since kirroha's getting lynched.<br>\n<br>\nGiF and Implosion are easy then because at least one has to be town from the gunsmith clears, and that means syndesis has to be the partner to whichever is scum by PoE. Also townreading GiF for his play and bad(as in unlikely for scum) association with GR I mentioned yesterday, also factoring in the gunsmith check.<br>\nEven if I'm wrong on my MoI read, which I doubt, he would probably still be scum with syndesis though.<br>\n<br>\nsyn/imp &gt;&gt;&gt; syn/moi &gt; syn/gif (I'm not 100% on the order of these latter two) &gt; imp/Moi.<br>\n<br>\nThankfully GiF/moi I can rule out from rubixxx/ink interactions back in day 1-2.<br>\n<br>\nimp/MoI is harder because imp scum meta from what I saw is hard defending scumpartners but he almost takes it too far with his rubixxx defending (based on gut too), it's actually absurd if you read his ISO. From rubixx's side I don't see anything too bad though and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7662863#p7662863\">559</a> is actually pretty creative if they're scumpartners. I'm wary of using MoI for assocations because I expect scum-MoI to not leave anything obvious, but I don't see anything here standing out as evidence for imp/moi team, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7861750#p7861750\">1915</a> being slightly against it. I think overall this relationship is most likely scum Imp hard-buddying town-moi's slot using the rubixxx emotion as an excuse. Mostly the imp/moi review just makes me feel even worse about impl individually though. Particularly feel like he's prepared gif/me as a push for later back in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7831932#p7831932\">1844</a> <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7859516#p7859516\">1907</a>.<br>\n<br>\nIn practice this means syn lynch &gt;&gt;&gt; imp lynch today, the only scenario in which imp is better being if I misread syn AND one of MoI/GiF, which I really doubt after being right on kirro.<br>\nIf it's syn/imp as it probably is the order here is irrelevant though.<br>\n<br>\nAs for actual syn/imp interaction, Syn ISO doesn't have much content for associations, there's a weak tonal tr on imp and that's pretty much it. Implosion for most of the game had no actual scumreads (cited lack of motivation) but when he went into it he had syn as \"scummy but less scummy than rask\" if you take near bottom of his list to mean scummy; he actually phrased it as being the weakest townreads amongst townreading everyone lol. See my earlier post on scum having scum around that near-bottom-but-never-quite category. Until the GR flip, at which point he starts to townread syn and says it isn't bussing, didn't he second-guess even a bit unlike everyone else who at least considered what I said about it. Honestly no smoking guns via interaction, but no evidence against the association plus both being individually scummy plus townreads elsewhere and other teams looking unlikely makes me fairly convinced on this.<br>\n<br>\nI'm better still on the GiF slot with an ink re-read though I didn't like ink way back when for some reason. With GiF/imp and GiF/Moi out the only thing possible is syn/GiF which is a bad association considering syn's push on ink d2 (bussing 1 partner is ok but bussing both seems ludicrous). I wish GiF himself was more involved in this game though.<br>\n<br>\nThe only thing I'm slightly paranoid of is MoI almost entirely from the day 3 play discrediting RC and the kirro read feeling disproportionally based on her VT crumb and ideas, but logically I know that everyone accepting kirro yesterday means both other town were wrong there too, and if I have to find the person who looked the most convinced-yet-wrong-anyways as opposed to straight up lazy and settling (the latter blends in with scum) it would be him.<br>\n<br>\nBut yeah 90% it's syn/imp and going to vote syn unless anyone objects.", "time": "Wed Apr 27, 2016 2:08 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=65286&start=2000", "forum": "53", "thread": "65286"}

If I was syndesis as town scumreading me I would feel better than she did to take that 1 for 1 especially if it was me first, furthermore if she was town I'd expect at least one of the actual scum to support it as well because it's basically a free win for them setting up an easy lylo ml on either. This scenario has 3 people with some motivation to support it and I'd expect at least 1/3 to bite; town rejecting being traded for their #1 scumread is believable but combined with both of the scum being against the narrative as well I feel is really unlikely. Even if you're town and you hate the concept: when you're in a scenario where you want your scumread lynched and the lynch instead is someone you're settling on (syn said she thought scum was me+GiF), I think you'd at least consider it or just be a little bit or mildy opposed. She talked to me when I suggested it as if I was being stupid when she should have instead seen it as malicious or scum-motivated from a town pov talking to their scumread. I would have also wanted a town syn to push me with more conviction especially after being 'right' about GR; though this is a more minor thing.<br>\nI also think scum should have also setup suspicion onto syn if she was town as well for next-day preparation when it looked like my lynch was most likely; playing both sides of a TvT and using it to get both seems like optimal scumplay in that scenario. Looking back I do see this thinking used on me and kirroha but the only person I remember using it for me+syn (I see 1 scum in the two and this statement allows me to get the other tomorrow if one is ml'd) is MoI but him having that perspective as town considering the gs innos makes perfect sense; think about it.<br>\n<br>\nI'm actually surprised though, I didn't think I would get this much information from analysing and thinking about it but it sort of became an accidental reaction test. I was mostly just desperate from that shitty situation and wanted it not to be an insta-loss if I got lynched since I was/am pretty damn sure on my syn read: 1 for 1 with potential for 1 for 0 is essentially win-mostlywin. I think me being lynched there would have been instaloss in retrospect because kirroha probably would've been lynched the following lylo, or even the one after that if people pulled through.

I've <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">been</div> playing this game and have experienced the earlier days and have reads based on those. Look at all of the playing the game that dwlee was willing to do yesterday. He basically arbitrarily listed reads until a lynch happened. IMO the biggest reason this has been a struggle game was the constant stream of slots being under replacement from day one until yesterday. <br>\n<br>\nI don't really care about being read as town right now. I care about figuring out which of the three of you is scum (or which two) so that we can not-lose the game today. If we manage not to screw up today then I'll start caring about how I'm read. <br>\n<br>\nI would have remorse for having been in the game and not playing it but i <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">have</div> been playing it. I analyzed things as the game went on. I re-analyzed them yesterday. At some point it feels like looking at the same material too many times does more harm than good. Especially given that that's essentially why I don't have any strong reads right now. I've basically second-guessed everything that I've thought throughout this game. I was really, really confident rubixx's slot and synd were town based on their play and interactions with gr, and your recent actions probably aren't on par with the degree to which I saw their actions/relations as townish but because of recency they're more at the front of my mind. <br>\n<br>\nI've explained both of those townreads in pretty high depth throughout this game I think. Rubixxx made posts that I don't think would have been faked. Gr interacted with synd in a way that I don't think would have happened if they were both scum. With regards to 2020 like I said it's just overly simplistic. It's overlys implistic because assumes synd-town would be so confident in her read on you so as to stake the game. After you offered the 1 for 1 synd described you as \"probably scum?\" and I would hardly expect town with that stance to want to take an offer of a 1-for-1. It's overly simplistic because it assumes scum will just go for that kind of thing. Scum aren't going to \"accept\" or \"go for\" a 1-for-1 offer because that doesn't mean that it happens. That can look scummy to do. Like, most of the time that that kind of thing happens from town it's so that analysis like you gave in 2020 can be given and at that point you'd be calling anyone who jumped on scum and scum would know that. If you and synd are both town then it really isn't surprising at all that no one jumped on to that idea because it's not like as soon as people agree the 1-for-1 trade becomes sacredly ensrhined in gold with no takesies-backsies. It's not like scum can just say \"okay guys we did it the two townies are 1 for 1ing, we win, lets vote them.\" Because that's not how the dynamic nature of a mafia game works.", "time": "Sat Apr 30, 2016 11:47 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=65286&start=2025", "forum": "53", "thread": "65286"}

You're content to sit on old gut-reads and actually defending yourself having no scumreads. I'll tell you what town would do having 2 strong/high-depth townreads in your position in syn and rubixx; PoE and then push onto me and GiF. I know as a fact you wouldn't have made this post if I didn't prompt you do so and everything you say about trying to figure the game out means squat when you never \"show your work\"; do you think people would just take your word for it?

When I say presence I mean impact on the game; GiF in his short time got us to massclaim, developed reads and defended his townread on me preventing that wagon, whereas it feels like you've been completely static with no scumreads since about day 3 and I'll admit I'm biased towards the former. Comparing slots as a whole is a different story because of ink's play, and if I were to ignore that it'd be a lot harder to judge but as is I like the overall slot way more. As it is it's pretty irrelevant since we have to lynch outside the innos today and I only want syn, and at this point I'm not sure if it'll go to day six anyways.<br>\n<br>\nIdk, call me crazy but I feel like I have some obligation to win this even if nobody else cares; dragging what's left of the game to the finish line if I have to. Naturally if I'm wrong it'll suck but regardless of the outcome I wouldn't feel comfortable with myself if I wasn't putting all my effort into it. There's nothing you can learn from a game if you didn't even try and I personally would sooner replace out of a game than give up but stay anyways, but again I think you're way more likely just scum feeling good/complacent about your chances to win lylo either today or tomorrow with this \"I'm town with no motivation\" shtick. I'll give it to you, it's decent play considering the site meta because I usually see scum favour excuses and defend their apathy rather than straight up admitting they have a screwed pov + they don't care and probably won't in future; you went about half-and-half here with 2032 being the former and elsewhere the latter.", "time": "Sun May 01, 2016 12:46 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=65286&start=2025", "forum": "53", "thread": "65286"}

I chose Synd first as I have the most reassessment to do on his slot given the Kirroha flip.<br>\n<br>\nIn review the interactions between Synd and the Robster slot I can certainly see as scum.  Day 1 and 2 there was minimal ineractions that were more than on the surfact between them.  As examples -<br>\n<br>\nSynd asked ShortCut a question at <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7646489#p7646489\">200</a>.  ShortCut was absent for an extended amount of time and when ShortCut did return Synd again asked reminded SCB of the question.  Aside from that nada either way.  And Synd only moves to pressure that slot after ShortCut's replace at with <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7661425#p7661425\">553</a> which assesses &#8220;your predecessor was too terrible&#8221;.   Yet Synd had minimal interactions with the slot before that and really never mentioned SCB as scummy in any signficant way.  Reads as possible bussing.<br>\n<br>\nI also dislike his hop onto the Tojam wagon off of Robster's slot.  Tojam had only 5 posts before Synd made his change moved to the Robster slot wagon.  So Synd goes from voting the Robster slot to voting someone who joined them on said wagon.  I can see this as a possible bussing partner who saw the chance to move to a non-partner lynch on another low content target.<br>\n<br>\nAfter Golden replaces in the Synd - Golden interactions are very, very soft the rest of Day 1 and Day 2.  Robster on multiple occasions calls out Synd for scummy actions (example in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7677024#p7677024\">800</a> but doesn't make any effort to pressure or vote Synd.  This happens multiple times including posts in the 1000s and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7718321#p7718321\">1122</a>.  In summary those days Synd was always in the bottom of Golden's rankings as to who was scum but there was never any action to follow up on those claims.<br>\n<br>\nSynd's read on Golden doesn't seem very organic to me.   He mentions Golden is a Null read at <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7735378#p7735378\">1277</a>.  Then about 60 posts later at <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7748483#p7748483\">1332</a> Golden is now a probably Town read yet there is nothing between there where Synd interacts with Golden and Golden continues to softly call Synd scum.  I can see this as scum unwilling to commit to a counter-bus when the Beeboy slot was around to mislynch.<br>\n<br>\nProbably the most damning part of the Day 2 exchange is <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7737569#p7737569\">1285</a> by Robster.  Here Robster is trying to link Synd to GiF for the sin of \"calling each other scum without interacting with each other\" but that is in a nutshelll the treatment Robster's slot has laid on Synd - softly calling him scum while not interacting with him or trying to vote Synd.<br>\n<br>\nDay 3 could be cross-bussing.  The snipe back and forth at each other but Golden is happy to move to a Rask compromise lynch despite having a supposed strong scum read on Synd and Synd now moving Robster to a scum read.<br>\n<br>\nOverall I could see them as partners who got desperate due to Radiant's push on them Day 3 who decided to cross-bus in hopes that one would escape unscathed after the fact.<br>\n<br>\nCertainly not sold 100% but within the realm of possibility.<br>\n<br>\nNext up - review of Rask and the Golden slot.", "time": "Mon May 02, 2016 4:57 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=65286&start=2025", "forum": "53", "thread": "65286"}

Still ... it just is odd.<br>\n<br>\nI think given Rask's penchant for pointing out Rule of Three posting that <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7660919#p7660919\">546</a> actually fits that pattern - we have ShortCut mixed in with a group of 3 Town players.<br>\n<br>\nThe vote on Robster's slot at <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7676890#p7676890\">785</a> comes out of left field.  No suspicion posted their way just a hop onto a wagon with the reasoning \"my wagon on BBT (Town) isn't viable\".<br>\n<br>\nAnother point against Rask is that at <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7658004#p7658004\">451</a> she made a show of stating that pushing for claims was a bad idea Day 1 or Day 2.  Yet she is willing to bounce around to multiple wagons at the end of day (IAI, BBT, Golden) which basically generated at least 2 more claims than Kirrohas' VT claim and Kill's Jailkeep claim.  Reads as posturing to me as opposed to actual Town thinking.<br>\n<br>\nThe Day 2 interactions with Robster really aren't more indicative of Town trying to read scum.  Rask really never does much to establish a scum-read on Golden via interactions.  And Golden plays with the concept of suspecting Rask but keeps pushing it off to \"another Day\".<br>\n<br>\nVery much don't like <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7768668#p7768668\">1511</a> <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7768710#p7768710\">1512</a>.  If Synd is Town then this very much reads of indecisive bussing on Rask's part.<br>\n<br>\nBy the time Day 3 rolls around the interactions between the slots don't really deepen much.  They take turns voting each other and then backing off to another player without any questioning or scum-hunting backing up the movement.  And having re-read Rask's play around my entry I really, really dislike it.  Re-readiing the PoE again leaves a very bad taste in my mouth.  I can certainly see scum willing to bus (Robster) but happy to lump three Town in the \"must lynch\" pool and being willing to vote anyone there at a drop of a hat.", "time": "Tue May 03, 2016 7:53 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=65286&start=2025", "forum": "53", "thread": "65286"}

Why do you think you have been \"on point most of  game\"?  The only possible scum you bounced around on Day 1 was Robster (BBT was Town as was IAI and Tojam) and your push on that slot was basically non-existent Day 1.  You participated in the Beeboy mislynch Day 2.   Only 1 scum has been lynched so far Day 3 and guess what - all three of Synd, myself and yourself were on the wagon.  So I don't see how your reads are so spot on and you are so frustrated when you aren't statistically any better than any other living player.  You only pushed Synd yesterday and if Kirroha getting lynched in his place is the source of all this rage then I'm not sure what to tell you.<br>\n<br>\nFrankly this is a hot button issue for me because I see far too much crowing on the site since my return about how much better people's reads are than everyone else.

It feels like he's still testing the waters to a degree but doesn't want to commit to a second bus.

KTS, RC and Dwlee all almost certainly died because they were claimed PRs. As MoI mentioned BBT was a vig shot. That leaves IAI as the only nightkill that can really meaningfully be speculated. Looking at his ISO, IAI did suspect me; he also suspected rask and called syn town. He didn't really discuss those suspicions much on day two because neither of them were under pressure. You're hilariously mischaracterizing this game if you look at the nightkills and think it's relevant that each of them suspected at least one of the two of us. Even that statement is just so weak, that every townie killed at night suspected at least one of two people. I don't really feel like doing the work for it right now but it's almost certainly true for plenty of pairs of people in any given game just statistically. This line of reasoning both distills the opinions of people that have died into \"did they suspect at least one of these two people\" which both ignores their read on the other (in this case, IAI having read syn as town) and assumes baselessly that the reason they were killed was for their reads (which almost certainly isn't true of anyone but IAI, and still can't be safely assumed for him as there are a ton of different possible reasons for someone to be NK'd). <br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Virtue wrote:</cite>Syn and Implosion have some explaining to do regarding why this GR wagon folded.</div></blockquote>\nI mean, I unvoted because the slot was essentially afk and I didn't feel like I had enough information on it to be confident. I don't know what the high-level reason is why the wagon died. Probably largely because of the reason I unvoted. As I've said several times this game has often been defined by the people that are absent. When GR replaced in I thought his immediate posting looked town. I have no idea what you mean by \"we have some explaining to do.\" I'm not accountable for why a wagon died, I'm accountable for my own actions in this game, and I thought the shortcut/taisho wagon looked increasingly bad as time went on and people stayed on it despite a lack of a replacement. I was wrong.<br>\n<br>\nVirtue is reinforcing my scumread on his slot with these arguments. They're so flimsy in terms of the reasoning behind them and yet he's throwing them out as if they aren't. Granted he's said he's listening for \"good answers\" but those are not good questions. The fact that he looked through NK history and specifically singled out that everyone who died suspected either me or syn makes me think pretty strongly that he was looking for reasons to be able to call me+synd scum, rather than looking for who is scum from a neutral baseline.", "time": "Fri May 06, 2016 10:49 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=65286&start=2075", "forum": "53", "thread": "65286"}
