It was an exciting event, one many had been anticipating to attend all year. And finally the time had come. But of course, things were never as wonderful as the guests had hoped for. The mansion was located on a deserted island only accessible by ferry. Upon arrival, they noted how omnious the whole area was. Many were shocked at their surroundings, their extravagent expectations shattered within mere seconds. Murmurs of discomfort quikcly spread. \"It'll be okay guys. Come on now, I'm sure it's better once we're inside..\"  One of them commented nervously, trying to qwell the tension, though the uncertainty within her own voice was quite apparent. The group looked behind them, watching as the ferry quickly disappeared into the horizon.

There is to be no editing of posts.<br>5. Do not use any language other than English or any type of hidden, invisible or hard to read font.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Voting</span><br>1. All votes must be in bold like so: <span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: You</span>. Votes that are not bolded will not be counted.<br>2.

You may choose to Vote: No Lynch if you do not wish to lynch anyone that day.<br>4. A successful lynch requires a majority of votes (half the number of living players + 1). Once majority is reached, all other vote changes will be disregarded. Players (even the one who was lynched) may talk during Twilight.<br>5. If you are dead, you are dead.

Players who do not post for 72 hours will receive a prod. After two unsuccessful prods I will replace you.<br>4. If your lack of activity becomes a constant problem throughout the game, I will replace you. You may proceed to complain to me afterwards and in return I will proceed to ignore you.<br>5.

For somebody who shouted \"SCUMHUNT!!!\", you certainly didn't do any of it in that post. <br><br>Political- what is your read on Senjai at the moment? <br><br>And <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3962632#p3962632\" class=\"postlink\">#24</a> contributes a grand total of... nothing! Tries to push us back to the RVS/RQS stage, then states the obvious \"NL is bad, 'kay\"? <br><br>And 2+2=4 because the Flying Spaghetti Monster decreed it. That much should be obvious.  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\"> <br><br>I like Cry's <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3962658#p3962658\" class=\"postlink\">#28</a>, it feels like genuine pressure and prodding. <br><br><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3962674#p3962674\" class=\"postlink\">#30</a>- Really Political?

You did it with Senjai because he was new, and now you are doing it to DCL for... why are you doing it to DCL exactly?

You have enough of a read on the interactions between the two to judge that one of those two must be scum, but not enough of one to pick one or the other? Or even provide an FOS on either of them? And given that you have yet to vote this game, why not just pick one of them at random, at the very least? <br><br><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3962796#p3962796\" class=\"postlink\">#51</a>- Appeal to experience.

I might agree if he had his vote on one of them, or anybody for that matter, but I hate the fact that he's refusing to vote one, after saying that he gets scumvibes from both. He has yet to comment on anything else that's occurred on the game thus far, and I fail to see how voting wouldn't pressure the players and encourage discussion. Feels like distancing to me, and your defending him is draining your pro-town cred. I'd recommend you stop that. <br><br><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3962838#p3962838\" class=\"postlink\">#56</a>- fair enough, thanks for explaining. Now... why do you have to \"see how things go\" before voting one of them again? It's not like you have any better cases to push, or even have commented on any other events in the game.

Hiraki isn't buddying with soras in that comment; he's saying that he feels that your behavior towards him is scummy. Just as I do. And why would it never get a serious wagon on soras?

And even if it was just a dumb move by newbscum Senjai, I don't believe that he would be able to come up with detailed reasons for it. Cry's debate with Senjai doesn't really give me much on him though, since it was really a theory discussion.<br><br>However, I do have a question- <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3962577#p3962577\" class=\"postlink\">post 19</a>, Senjai wrote:</cite><span style=\"font-style: italic\">I think the people who are more suspicious are the ones who wait to post and analyze the argument and either bandwagon or post irrelevant material</span>. Given that this game is so fresh we've not had the time to commit people to being lurkers or bandwagoners. I don't think a lynch in day 1 would offer any great value, much akin to throwing a dart at a dartboard blindfolded.</div></blockquote><br><br>Why do you believe the italicized? <br><br>*snip*<br><br></div></blockquote><br><br>Well perhaps that I am new and ignorant, but my thought process is that it is the goal of the mafia to confuse and cause chaos among the townies in order to lengthen their survival. Some examples on how I think they can do this by posting regularly, initiating invalid/pre-discussed arguments or random accusations or simply changing the topic at hand. Another method would not be posting at all and simple voting (lurking) or bandwagoning without much reason or explanation if that member knows the target of the bandwagon is a townie. These would be things I would look for, it's also one of the reasons why I slightly suspect Hiraki. In hindsight it's fairly obvious as to why the NL wouldn't work, but I explained my previous intentions for the NL in an earlier post.<br><br>In post 62 the tl;dr of it was: I changed my vote simply because I liked Political's tone moreso than crys, which almost seemed outright aggressive. I go on to state that I believe I shouldnt blatantly throw around votes so easily and am aiming to make more decisive and sound votes and change them less often.<br><br>In the latter of the post I mention I feel like PC and Hiraki feel scummy to me. Most of this is gut feeling. While sarcasm is not a scum read, with absence of additional information the abundant use of it by Hiraki worries me. I do not know him as a person, but his aggressive and almost teasing banter with soros leans me to think of him as a scummier guy, at least with the information we have at hand. It was as if he was begging for a fight in my opinion. I think that soros was simply defending himself, and I'm pretty neutral to him. <br><br>While I admire your knowledge of logical fallacies (strawman and AtE) my initial vote change was just an appeal to ethos one. And believe, given the agressive nature of Hiraki's posts that he may have felt insulted as if he didnt know how to play, in which his appeal to experience was simply to say: \"I do know how to play and don't say otherwise\" should he have perceived his comments that way. It was not imo a way to dodge or get out of a situation."}

The thing I dislike about Jackal in particular is the fact that he felt comfortable actually casting a vote. The rest of the players that were playing catch-up made posts amounting to \"Wow this game is fast. Please slow down.\" Jackal not only didn't comment on the speed of the game, didn't comment on any of the content, and didn't say that he wasn't done reading, yet voted based on P1 information. That, to me, was indicative that he HAD read the thread. Now, maybe he didn't read past page 1- I can't deny the possibility. But the fact that he didn't say anything about not being caught up, or complain about how difficult it was FOR him to keep up, gives me the indicator that yeah, he might be caught up. I could be wrong, and that scumread will become null once it's CONFIRMED that I'm wrong. Until them, I feel comfortable with my assertion. Any particular reason you're being so aggressive re: my Jackal suspicion? <br><br>(I actually dislike pecan's post too, now that I've looked at it again.)<br><br>Oh and hey, speaking of ignoring things, care to comment on my case on you?"}

It's easy to note that when your in a defensive position you're more focused on proving your own innocence than contesting his, this could be a scum tactic or could be completely irrelevant.

Although I'm hoping those lagging behind a bit make their presence known soon.</div></blockquote><br><br>I'll be the first to admit that I'm an impatient and hyper-aggressive player. I think of mafia like a game of chess, except that the mafia have a quick advantage, due to the fact that they have information that the town doesn't right from the get go, and can coordinate actions. Hence, they essentially get an additional rook and queen. One of the most important parts of the opening game of chess is to take control of the middle of the board- be aggressive, and push pieces forward. I argue that the same applies with Mafia. <br><br>In order to counter the coordination of the mafia, the town must do two things- throw the mafia off balance, and get information about the other players. One of the best ways to do this is via an early wagon- through pushing players and putting pressure on them, you're more likely to be able to both get the mafia to slip up, and generate better reads. The more accurate a read on a player is, the more information the town accumulates. <br><br>For instance, the pressure I am currently placing makes me think that you are likely town- you're sticking to your guns, and provided solid reads on the rest of the players in your previous post. <br><br>Hence, I am against playing passively in the early game- if the game is taken too slowly, then the mafia have more time to both coordinate their movements and figure out ways to force stagnation. It also allows them to be more prepared for pressure, and thus can make it harder to generate solid reads. I believe more than anything that this is merely a playstyle difference. <br><br>Let me make this clear: An early lynch is anti-town, and anybody encouraging it should be scrutinized heavily. An early bandwagon is pro-town. <br><br>Glad to see DCL, and can't wait for the promised content. I'm glad to see I was wrong re: Jackal- I'll be glad to see future content. I'll respond to Senjai's post at a future date- this post is long enough as it is. (I hope I covered the other post I skipped in my response to Political, Senjai. If you have any more comments in regards to my Jackal suspicion that you feel I missed, feel free to bring them up)."}

Although I'm hoping those lagging behind a bit make their presence known soon.</div></blockquote><br><br>I'll be the first to admit that I'm an impatient and hyper-aggressive player. I think of mafia like a game of chess, except that the mafia have a quick advantage, due to the fact that they have information that the town doesn't right from the get go, and can coordinate actions. Hence, they essentially get an additional rook and queen. One of the most important parts of the opening game of chess is to take control of the middle of the board- be aggressive, and push pieces forward. I argue that the same applies with Mafia. <br><br>In order to counter the coordination of the mafia, the town must do two things- throw the mafia off balance, and get information about the other players. One of the best ways to do this is via an early wagon- through pushing players and putting pressure on them, you're more likely to be able to both get the mafia to slip up, and generate better reads. The more accurate a read on a player is, the more information the town accumulates. <br><br>For instance, the pressure I am currently placing makes me think that you are likely town- you're sticking to your guns, and provided solid reads on the rest of the players in your previous post. <br><br>Hence, I am against playing passively in the early game- if the game is taken too slowly, then the mafia have more time to both coordinate their movements and figure out ways to force stagnation. It also allows them to be more prepared for pressure, and thus can make it harder to generate solid reads. I believe more than anything that this is merely a playstyle difference. <br><br>Let me make this clear: An early lynch is anti-town, and anybody encouraging it should be scrutinized heavily. An early bandwagon is pro-town. <br><br>Glad to see DCL, and can't wait for the promised content. I'm glad to see I was wrong re: Jackal- I'll be glad to see future content. I'll respond to Senjai's post at a future date- this post is long enough as it is. (I hope I covered the other post I skipped in my response to Political, Senjai. If you have any more comments in regards to my Jackal suspicion that you feel I missed, feel free to bring them up).</div></blockquote><br><br>Thats twice you've said you'd respond to me later <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\"><br><br>Although your recent post cleared up most of my previous post, I still cant read on you, your reasoning is completely sound, but could also be very strategic.

It's like a feeling of when I'm town and I've tried to refute any case against me, but they just ignore it and keep voting me and I feel helpless and don't understand why.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Political Clout wrote:</cite>can someone explain why hiraki is town?

I'm in the process of looking for a replacement.</span></span><br><br>I hate that during the DCL-soras exchange, DCL tries to say that no active player replied to his \"question\" of if they thought who was scummy when, indirectly, everyone did. There is currently a wagon on one of the players and people have stated reads on the other.<br><br>I also personally don't find the ad hom stuff to be scummy. Soras clearly came into the game pissed off because he felt like the quality of play (an NL, the denying of RVS by multiple people) was awful. From his point of view, I can see him feeling like he's stuck in a newb game and therefore the adhom/standoffishness just represents that.<br><br>@PC: I'll start with your 2nd question: The only reason I found 79 scummy, as I had stated, was because you had backed off soras and said he was town once other people started calling him town. I believe that you briefly mentioned later somewhere that you liked my reasoning behind him being protown so that point is a little moot if that's true.<br><br>I found and still find Hiraki to be townish for a few reasons. The way he handled the soras exchange struck me as protown at the time because he started to almost retaliate against soras, telling him to take a side, but then almost defended soras saying that what PC was accusing him of wasn't scummy at all. Also, if you ISO Hiraki, his way of posting (laidback, careless, not always on the predominant topic at hand) did not strike me as scum. I'd move Hiraki to a null position at this point.<br><br>I recall someone asking me why I felt pecan was leaning town. His first post was called out and I felt like he responded appropriately with good overall reads for the game and I also like the sarcastic sig comment he made at one point that felt like he was almost calling out DCL.<br><br>CryMeARiver - town<br>DCLXVI - Just because I disagree with his case doesn't mean he's scummy, but I definitely don't find anything protown: Null<br>drmyshotgun - Bad posting that should lead to scumminess, but I have this stupid feeling that is saying I believe him: Null<br>Gooner - Defensive out the gate and don't like \"bandwagon\" wording: Scummy<br>Hiraki - See above: Nulltown<br>Jackal711 - Didn't come out the gate right, hasn't posted anything notable: Too soon<br>johnnywup - WHERE OH WHERE ARE YOU<br>Senjai - Newbtown<br>sorasgoof - Town<br>NihilisticNinja - Great posting, but it's either great play as scum or great play as town.

So much IIoA, and aside from a case against soras that was really weak in my opinion (soras defended himself quite well, more townpoints for him) there really isn't much there. Almost his entire case on Soras is that he's being too abrasive, which is a nulltell. There is a bit about how his \"question was scummy\", and I don't heavily disagree, but the fact that he can't explain why it was scummy gives me bad vibes. Also, feels like mild hedging there on Gooner. <br><br>I heavily dislike shotgun's early posting, but his case on Gooner isn't bad.

I don't feel that just because I'm aggressive I really should be that difficult to get a read on- if you feel that it's impossible to really get a read on me due to my words, then get a read on me due to my actions. You did a good job with that in regards to Jackal.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3964953#p3964953\" class=\"postlink\">post 116</a>, NihilisticNinja wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3964734#p3964734\" class=\"postlink\">post 104</a>, Senjai wrote:</cite>I have no specific read on him at the moment.

I'd like to remind everyone though that while your stuck defending yourself has NN inquisitively questions 99% of posts (not meant to be an insult, I like that you're so intrigued and the answers help everyone) to remember to try and find things that would promote a town or scum read on NN.</div></blockquote><br><br>Really? I disagree. I feel that by pressuring one of the most active players and a serious contributor, I'm calling attention to myself, because that player can respond to my case and note if they feel that my actions are not in the town's best interest, or that my case is built on bad logic. The fact that Political has not provided any sort of defense for his behavior, or provided a read on me at all, really only increases my suspicions on him. <br></div></blockquote><br><br>While your putting yourself out in the open, you did not start the wagon on Political. Initial comments by others hinted at it and you simply elaborated on it. As I said before I agree with your comments on Political, but after there has already been some scrutiny towards Political if you ever had to seriously come out against any one player it would be him. I'm not saying your wrong, but it would be the safest bet. On a side note, even though I feel Hiraki is slightly scummy, though most disagree with me (I might have to read back and see if I can come to the same point of view) he is voting for PC. Should PC be lynched and mafia that would clear me of initial suspicion of Hiraki, while if he was Town I really won't know what to think, as I too am on that wagon (at this moment).[/quote]<br><br>If Political is scum, that would not clear Hiraki of being scum. Even if Hiraki stayed on the wagon, scum often lynch each other. Don't see Hiraki doing that D1, but it isn't unprecedented. And I disagree that I didn't start the wagon on Political. It wasn't going much of anywhere until I voted and started pushing others to vote. The first voter is often not the wagon-starter. <br><br>Also, I don't recall you making a case against Hiraki. If you did, can you link to it? If not, explain it. Being I'm just not feeling it. <br><br>And the last part of your post is solid, I don't really have that much to say about it.</div></div></div><br><br>Senjai- what are your reads on DCL and Gooner at the moment?"}

He was talking about himself, not you. Hence the \"3 people quickly jumping on a VI wagon\" right after people started voting him. Oh, and he specifically says in #151 that a \"couple of people jump on me\", and uses it to justify his Gooner vote! <br><br>Now, let's look at your wagon. Hiraki and I vote you. Senjai votes based on a \"hunch\". I put a bit more pressure on you, and then Gooner calls you the \"bandwagon of the moment\". He says that he feels that some of the content that you have posted is scummy, but \"not enough to vote yet\". I ask why that is, and he says that it's \"nowhere near solid yet\". Pecan does basically the exact same thing that Gooner did- says that you're scummy, but not \"scummy enough to vote yet\". Then I put pressure on pecan to vote, since he says that he suspects DCL, and he accuses me of pushing people to vote because the \"PC wagon is lagging\". (Why focus on the PC wagon when you expressed suspicion on DCL and not PC)? <br><br>Cry then joins the wagon. <br><br>When I continue to put pressure on Gooner asking why he refuses to vote PC, he replies that he's \"early in the day yet\". <br><br>And then this is where it gets interesting: Shotty jumps on the wagon, putting PC at L-2.<br><br>Suddenly, everybody is all over him. Sora votes him. Pecan suddenly votes him (What happened to your suspicions of DCL and shotty)? And then Gooner suddenly votes him.

Happens to everybody at one point or another. ^^. <br><br>And to trim down the wagon post, because it definitely is TL;DR- <br><br><div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: Early Wagon Analysis</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display: none;\">Essentially, in my opinion, the actions on certain players don't make sense regarding the Political wagon. Hiraki, Junpei, and I vote for Political, with Cry voting later. Soras states that one of PC/Hiraki is scum, but that he doesn't feel comfortable voting with the information he has. <br><br>Then I push for Gooner to join the wagon- he agrees that political is scummy, but says that there isn't enough there to get him to vote. I find this odd, given the fact that it would merely put Political at L-3 with no real risk for a lynch to be reached and continue to pressure, and he says that there isn't anything solid enough. <br><br>Pecan comes along with similar reasoning- they agree that Political is scummy, but that DCL is scummier, but don't vote. I ask why this is, and pecan states that there's no need for me to worry about \"pushing votes down\" because the PC wagon isn't moving. This is something I find slightly odd. After all, pecan would be voting for DCL if they voted, so why would he comment about the traction of the PC wagon? Not a big deal, just bugs me a bit. <br><br>Then, Shotgun comes along and puts PC at L-2. A wagon instantly forms. Shotgun notes PC's 4 contentless posts, his L-2 vote, and votes him as a result. Fair enough. Then pecan jumps on, without giving any reasoning beyond a vague \"Don't like those posts\". Earlier he stated that there was no need to worry about voting or starting a wagon, and now he's quickly building momentum for a shotgun wagon based on a handful of posts, without providing any reasoning?<br><br>Gooner then jumps on with the same reasoning as the other two. He does argue later that shotgun was scummier, but I don't quite get his reasons why PC wasn't worth a vote, if shotgun was. He argues that scum \"go into the background\", and are \"calculating\" but isn't coming in and immediately putting a player at L-2 drawing attention to yourself, and extremely reckless? And if he wasn't really advancing the discussion, wasn't he really \"in the background\"? <br><br>This is then followed by Political's vote. Simply the shady nature of this wagon and how hard it was to get one to form on Political make me really think that it's a scum-motivated counterwagon. The Goonerwagon doesn't look much better.</div></div></div><br><br>I hope this post was somewhat easier to digest."}

Which part?<br>post #151: So, here's where I came in a few hours ago and complained, acted stupid threw a vote at the popular wagon. Couple of people jump on me, including Sorgasboof and Pecanpie. I just threw a random vote (albeit popular candidate), and Gooner, who didn't vote on Political Clout for his behaviour throws a vote at me. My first actual contribution to generate some buzz and look at him rushing in to join the feast!<br>Caught ya. <br>I'm going to link him with Political Clout for now. He's my top suspect.

This is good posting and good linking. He's right, there's a big connection between Gooner and PC that I see here. And how does Gooner respond?

So you are right in the fact that my original \"backing off\" occurred because of the newness. But I don't think I particularly backed off because my vote stayed on him until he started to play better. I had no reason to \"pressure\" him persay because he had already 1) Explained his original reasoning for NL and 2) Converted to my belief of not NLing by voting me, which pleased me.<br><br>2) No, I personally don't think there was anymore to comment on. I realize that what I saw as a scumtell (NLing) at first may not have been viewed the same by other people and warranted as big of a comment. Plus I had already said most of what needed to be said on the subject. He did make a slight comment and I can see that as good enough.

He says that he feels that some of the content that you have posted is scummy, but \"not enough to vote yet\". I ask why that is, and he says that it's \"nowhere near solid yet\". Pecan does basically the exact same thing that Gooner did- says that you're scummy, but not \"scummy enough to vote yet\".

More relevant discussion more reads. DMS is abrupt and reckless and uses hindsight to explain a lot of his actions while really not committing much to the discussion.

Hiraki, Junpei, and I vote for Political, with Cry voting later. Soras states that one of PC/Hiraki is scum, but that he doesn't feel comfortable voting with the information he has. <br><br>Then I push for Gooner to join the wagon- he agrees that political is scummy, but says that there isn't enough there to get him to vote. I find this odd, given the fact that it would merely put Political at L-3 with no real risk for a lynch to be reached and continue to pressure, and he says that there isn't anything solid enough. <br><br>Pecan comes along with similar reasoning- they agree that Political is scummy, but that DCL is scummier, but don't vote. I ask why this is, and pecan states that there's no need for me to worry about \"pushing votes down\" because the PC wagon isn't moving. This is something I find slightly odd. After all, pecan would be voting for DCL if they voted, so why would he comment about the traction of the PC wagon? Not a big deal, just bugs me a bit. <br><br>Then, Shotgun comes along and puts PC at L-2. A wagon instantly forms. Shotgun notes PC's 4 contentless posts, his L-2 vote, and votes him as a result. Fair enough. Then pecan jumps on, without giving any reasoning beyond a vague \"Don't like those posts\".

I would love to see more info from DMS on exactly what he gained by doing that. Both town and scum are going to jump on someone for doing scummy stuff, at this point differentiating between vigilant townies and scum looking for a mislynch would seem to be difficult.

FakeGod needs to make his catchup post first, but we definitely need to decide soon which route we're going to go:<br><br>1) Lynch an active lurker. This list would consist of PB and Jackal.<br>    a) Upside: A player like this will never be killed by mafia as they introduce too much WIFOM as far as whether they should be lynched or not to confuse and divide the town. If town, they could even waste a lynch that will not get mafia killed for a day. Also, a player like this can NOT, I repeat, CANNOT make it to a MYLO/LYLO situation in the game. This will hurt town so bad. It's best to get rid of them early.<br>    b) Downside: We might have a vig that can do it for us. But we can't possibly know this (please don't hint to being a vig if you are -__- This is NOT a rolefish, don't mistake it for such). Also, on Day 2, we're almost in the same situation we are now because we can't look at connections between the dead and the living.<br><br>2) Lynch an active player who has been found scummy. This list would consist of Gooner, PC, and DMS.<br>    a) Upside: Even if they end up flipping town, we can analyze bandwagons and connections between the dead and the living and we get rid of a player that might have been mistaken for scum later in the game.<br>    b) Downside: A player that lurks will live longer.<br><br>But yes, there are 5 possible lynches today: PB, Jackal, Gooner, PC, and DMS. If you're not on one of these wagons, get on it. We're not lynching anyone else (yes I'm trying to lead town which scum can do too, but I'm not leading them unreasonably. We've practically all had suspicions for these players)."}

That post reads of someone who is trying to look like he's posting without contributing anything at all. I can't believe they are getting away with the play that they are showing in this game."}

Your logic in your post doesnt make sense, you cant possibly think because my opinion of your posting is dirt less the one post about gooner that I think that anyone who disagrees with me is an idiot.<br><br>People can have different opinions, that's fine with me. I'm stating mine. Just because they disagree does not mean I think they're idiots. They also make logically sound posts and respond adequately to questions directed to them. Less jackal and PB who just lurk behind the scenes. While PB's posting is of low quality or active lurking (probably the latter) his posts make sense.<br><br>If you are really struggling to see my point of view I will compile a complete case against you to help make it clear. To which i expect you to respond and - read -<br><br>This won't be done till later this night though. If your defense makes sense I might reconsider my stance, as of late I don't see my vote changing this day."}

This is not comprehensive, just the things that jumped out at me the most during my initial read through.<br><br>Nihil struck me as the most town player, but several of her posts have a very \"hey guys look how town I am!\" feeling. Normally I wouldn't point this out, but as scum I've actually been (correctly) lynched almost on that logic alone. I will be in no way shape or form interested in lynching this slot today, but I feel like it's an easy slot to write off as obvtown, which is a huge mistake to do during day 1. If needed, I'll go back and find the points that made me think this.<br><br>I'm hesitant to post this, but when I was looking at this game from a zero knowledge perspective, this felt like a really bad defense of another player to me:<br><blockquote><div><cite>CMAR wrote:</cite>Fuck. Such bad posting from shotgun. And yet, for some eery reason, I fucking believe him when his only notable statement of the entire game has been I'm not scum. Fuck me. Shotgun, play better.<br></div></blockquote><br>Then directly following, another from PC:<br><blockquote><div><cite>CMAR wrote:</cite>Damnit. And now I'm getting a feeling from the following post by PC. It's like a feeling of when I'm town and I've tried to refute any case against me, but they just ignore it and keep voting me and I feel helpless and don't understand why.<br></div></blockquote><br>It looks like not very genuine frustration to me, and it very well could be scum hopping off wagons or suspicions that he knows isn't safe for him to be on. I've felt CMAR to be one of the more town players overall, but I didn't like this post very much.<br><br>Pecan seems to have escaped a lot of scrutiny this game after being declared a town read by Nihil. I feel like this is a particular problem when reading <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3967037#p3967037\" class=\"postlink\">posts 158 and 158</a> sequentially. While 157 was sort of a mess, there is definite information there. He clearly states:<br><blockquote><div><cite>Pecan wrote:</cite>But if I had to vote someone right now, which I'm not prepared to do just yet, but if I had to it would be DCL. <br></div></blockquote><br>with the following reasoning:<br><blockquote><div><cite>Pecan wrote:</cite>seem so plainly condescending that I'm not sure why they didn't draw a little more attention. There isn't much beyond my gut that would put him above some others, but it's certainly churning from that tone.<br></div></blockquote><br>What strikes me is how he says he isn't ready to vote just yet. Right in his next post, he votes for Gooner, which is extremely weird considering in his previous post he seemed to only have minor suspicion of him. It's clear that shotgun's case against Gooner wasn't a ninja post or anything, they were hours apart, so I really don't get why the sudden change of heart <span style=\"font-style: italic\">and a vote minutes after he said he wasn't ready to vote yet</span>. This does not sit well with me at all.<br><br>Hiraki's <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3967146#p3967146\" class=\"postlink\">post 159</a> was solidly bad for several reasons. While I agree that DLC's \"case\" on you was really bad, the way you responded to it was quite a bit worse. The rest of the post was zero analysis of things that have happened and a lot of degrading other players. Your ISO is actually quite full of this. When I have the time I'm going to delve deeper in to this, there might be something here.<br><br>As I've said before, <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3968201#p3968201\" class=\"postlink\">Nihil's 176</a> was the best post of this game so far. During day 1, solid reads of players are incredibly unreliable but the behavior of wagons tell many truths. A wagon that is this difficult to maintain despite the number of people who have expressed suspicion, especially considering how weak the reasoning has been for counter wagons and how interested people have been on lurker hunting instead of pressuring their suspicions genuinely makes me feel like PC is one of our really good lynch options for today. I'll present a full case on why I'd like to see him hang later on.<br><br>Prolapsed's <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3968465#p3968465\" class=\"postlink\">post 180</a> has probably been the scummiest post of the game so far. Let's take a look:<br><blockquote><div><cite>PB wrote:</cite>Their interactions make me feel that at least one, and perhaps two, of them are scum. I kinda went \"eeny meeny miney moe\" and chose soras.<br></div></blockquote><br>So this is your reasoning for your stance and your vote? Seriously? \"Their interactions\" is how you're going to declare someone scummy on day 1. Brilliant. Then you pick one out at random instead of analyzing who is the most likely to be scum. Definitely playing from a survival standpoint looking for a safe place to park your vote instead of actually trying to find scum.<br><blockquote><div><cite>PB wrote:</cite>I just feel that hiraki/CMAR/soras are scummier as a group than PC and/or Senjai.<br></div></blockquote><br>So we're picking out whole scum teams on day 1 and voting based on interactions when we don't have flips, eh? Then we go off and discount a player as VI. Sure seems like you want to keep the focus on a specific group of players, and almost arbitrarily. Why?<br><blockquote><div><cite>PB wrote:</cite>This is quite scummy. Or at least anti-town.<br></div></blockquote><br>It was anti-town for sure (and I'll get to Jackal later), but how was it scummy? You just said \"this is\" without explaining why, which is the most important part of this game.<br><blockquote><div><cite>PB wrote:</cite>NN is prob-town (or very crafty scum) for 113.<br></div></blockquote><br>While I agree with your read, this is such a useless statement.<br><blockquote><div><cite>PB wrote:</cite>FFS this is not how you play mafia. Get real. Also, please explain what you are pointing out in post 135.<br></div></blockquote><br>Funny, I haven't seen any scum hunting from you, either. Pot and kettle?<br><br>Jackal's <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3969742#p3969742\" class=\"postlink\">post 215</a> is awful awful awful. It is the one thing that would really hold me back from voting PC, and basically tells me if PC flips town, Jackal is probably scum. Definitely reads like lazy scum not wanting to really comment on the game.<br><blockquote><div><cite>PB wrote:</cite>Not much has changed for me since yesterday.<br><br>Carry on.<br></div></blockquote><br>Translated: I'm not going to advance this game at all, but I'd like to post something to make it look like I'm not flying under the radar so harshly.<br><br>I don't like how CMAR seems to be advocating a lurker lynch over a scummy player lynch in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3971784#p3971784\" class=\"postlink\">post 247</a>. It isn't a staunch preference, so he gave himself some room here, but it made me make a face when I read that post.<br><br>I've got lots more to discuss but that's all I have time for right now.

I noted, however, that it took PC longer than most (bottom of page 2) to really begin any serious discussion. It seems strange that someone who would make these arguments would not seek to quickly engage in the active discussion that resulted from what we learned in the first few votes. Nothing too serious here, but worth noting.

While I don't exactly like what sora was doing, PC's reaction bothered me. It felt like PC was worried about which one of himself and Hiraki would be voted and take the early spotlight, and town wouldn't worry about that. The whole exchange felt scummy to me.<br><br>Then his next post, when confronted about voting sora, he responded with this:<br><blockquote><div><cite>PC wrote:</cite>who said it was scummy? and why wouldn't I vote?<br></div></blockquote><br>So you saw something that wasn't scummy, and you voted for it. Why wouldn't you vote? Because there was nothing scummy. Why would you undermine your own vote? Obviously if you vote someone, you're implying what they did was scummy. Otherwise why WOULD you vote? Looks like you got called out on some bad \"scum hunting\" and wanted to retract it. Who does that? Not town, that's for sure.<br><br>Then what Hiraki tore apart the offending post in more detail than I just did, PC counters with this:<br><blockquote><div><cite>PC wrote:</cite>so this is the part where you buddy the guy that said one of us was scum good to know.<br></div></blockquote><br>This is attempting to undermine the argument without actually responding to it. Then the \"Meh I don't mind though\", trying to play it off cool like it doesn't bother him. Obviously, with the way he's treated the situation so far, he minds. Town doesn't try to give false impressions about their reactions, as town has nothing to hide.<br><br>His <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3963695#p3963695\" class=\"postlink\">post 79</a>, while not inherently scummy, shows more of his lack of scum hunting while still posting regularly.<br><br>His following posts seem to be doing one of two things: defending Jackal or defending himself when being scum hunted.<br><br>His first, and so far only, attempt at scum hunting comes in the form of <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3968076#p3968076\" class=\"postlink\">post 171</a>. He attacks Shotgun for suggesting in one post that PC is VI and suggesting in another that PC is Gooner's scum buddy. This doesn't track though, because Shotgun's reason for calling you Gooner's scum buddy were associative tells (which I hate being used day 1, but I obviously can't grill Shotgun about doing that) that had nothing to do with you individually.

Not only is he hypocritical, but he makes a very key scum slip here. He declares \"THE SCUMTEAM\" as in, these are all the players that are scum, as Jackal and FakeGod. He knows the scum team is 2 people, huh? Therefore with this knowledge of 2 people being scum in a mini of this size he'd easily come to the conclusion that there probably is a SK.<br><br>Seriously, you don't get this kind of admittance of knowledge on a silver platter very often.<br><br>In defense of some questions, he makes <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3983339#p3983339\" class=\"postlink\">post 344</a>. When asked why he finds people scummy, one was \"he just seems scummy\" and the other was \"he's a replacement\". Seriously? So I'm scummy now because I'm a replacement?<br><br>Then he backtracks hard on his guessing of there being an SK. Realistically, scum doesn't know if there is one or not so this makes perfect sense. Town, however, wouldn't even think about an SK this early in the game. Out of all the mini's I've played so far, I can only think of a single one that contained a SK. They're pretty rare. The only reason someone would consider there being one is having information that suggests there is one.

Towards the end of day 1, PC was involved in some of this as well (specifically with DLC and Gooner). I'd bet my left nut that there's scum in the mix here. As I stated before I believe between the group of DLC, Gooner, and Hiraki there can be no more than one scum. PC could potentially be scum as well along with someone in the main 3.<br><br>Taking a look at the big picture of said clusterfuck, it doesn't really make sense for Majiffy to be scum. I don't really buy the whole point about him laying claim to PC's case (though I don't like someone sheeping a scum read unless they present evidence of a bus), and his attacks read pretty genuine to me. He also didn't start the initial trio of Gooner/DLC/Hiraki, and doesn't really track well with being a scum buddy of any of them. While he is by no means confirmed, for the purpose of this situation I'm going to assume he's town.<br><br>Here are the following assumptions I am making to attempt to make sense of all of this:<br>1) Exactly one of Hiraki, Gooner, and DLC is scum.<br>2) Majiffy is town.<br>3) PC is potentially scum, but attacked both DLC and Gooner during day 1's PB wagon.<br>4) A standard mini of this size will probably have a 3 man scum team, leaving one of the lurkers or those not involved in this clusterfuck as the final scum. I'm liking Equinox for this.<br><br>-PC attacked Gooner, but seemed more confident of a DLC scum flip by the end of day 1.<br>-DLC attacked PC during day 1 (and asserted that a PB flip would make PC even scummier, which oddly enough DLC never brought up during day 2). Once day 2 started, he began tunneling HARD on Majiffy.<br>-Majiffy suspected PC day 1, but also sheeped his case of Gooner. has solidly tunneled on Gooner so far for day 2.<br>-Gooner pushed PB most of day 1 and has been going back and forward with Hiraki for pretty much all of day 2.<br>-Hiraki pushed PB for a while during day 1 but sort of fell off. He votes Senjai very briefly, and votes Gooner at the start of day 2. The vote seems fairly random. Sheeps Majiffy without reason, who has presented no reason to vote, then later \"is worried\" about Majiffy, but still presses Gooner.<br><br>I'm trying to make sense of all this, but so far I'm thinking DLC is the most likely scum in the core 3. PC's last vote switch during day 1 looks like they could potentially be connected as well. Gooner feels the least likely scum of the bunch, with Hiraki probably only being scum on the condition of a DLC town flip. I still want to see what PC has to say, but for now I'm going to park my vote here:<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Unvote, vote DLC</span>.<br><br> I'm very willing to switch my vote to PC, and might after he posts some content for day 2 and I make a full case on him. I apologize if this is a bit all over the place, but the information to analyze today is equally confusing."}

So...<br><br>So, his case on me rests on I believe three premises. It is a very interesting way of setting up a case against someone. Definitely thinking outside the box, but his conclusion, at least as it refers to me, is wrong.<br><br>1. There is a strong connection between DCL(me), Hiraki, and Gooner.<br>2. One of the three in our group is scum.<br>3. Hiraki and Gooner are town.<br><br>So, before I get to some other points that ICE specifically said I want to a dress these three points.<br><br>1. I agree that there is a strong connection between Hiraki and Gooner. There is not a similar connection between me and either of those two. While I have interacted with them, I have stayed out of their recent spat. The only comment I made about it was something like \"I'm not impressed with either of their cases.\" Because there isn't any strong connection between me and Hiraki/Gooner. It seems as if ICE is just arbitrarily dumping me in with them. I know that may not be his intention (and I don't think it is). However, that is how it appears. <br><br>2. This premiss is complete speculation. There may be scum in this , there may not be scum. We don't know either way. To pick 3 players out of 11 and to say well, one of them must be scum seems like a lazy and flippant way to scum-hunt.<br><br>3. This premiss is also complete speculation. Neither has flipped, I don't see any evidence that strongly suggest that either would be confirmed town.<br><br>So what we have here is one false premiss followed by two that are just speculation.

Not me attacking PC. He was making some silly accusation towards me and as ICE himself noted I defended myself well. I said that a scum flip by PB would make me consider PC town whereas a town flip by PB would make me re-evaluate my townread on PC (yes my read on him was town in day 1. you can go back and check.) <br><br>So this point is wrong on both counts.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>2).

Firstly, you incorrectly identified one of my assumptions:<br><blockquote><div><cite>DLC wrote:</cite>3. Hiraki and Gooner are town.<br></div></blockquote><br>This was not something I said or even alluded to. I did state that Gooner seems to be the least likely to be scum out of the three (and gave reasoning for why I believe that), and that Hiraki could potentially be scum too but only seems likely if we have you as a town flip.<br><br>Majiffy is the one who I am assuming (for this situation's purpose) is town.<br><br>Secondly, your commentary on my premises isn't entirely accurate either:<br><blockquote><div><cite>DLC wrote:</cite>I agree that there is a strong connection between Hiraki and Gooner. There is not a similar connection between me and either of those two. While I have interacted with them, I have stayed out of their recent spat.<br></div></blockquote><br>You were certainly involved in the trio to an extent, but yes I agree not as much as those 2 have been. I actually indeed addressed this in my initial case. However, the connection stands especially when considering this whole clusterfuck involves 5 people not 3 (as I'm considering PC and Majiffy as well).<br><blockquote><div><cite>DLC wrote:</cite>2. This premiss is complete speculation.<br></div></blockquote><br>You can say that about pretty much any argument made at this point in the game as to why someone is scum. Just because it's speculation doesn't mean it's wrong. I could be, but it seems very likely that there is indeed one scum amongst your group. I've given reasons why.<br><blockquote><div><cite>DLC wrote:</cite>3. This premiss is also complete speculation. Neither has flipped, I don't see any evidence that strongly suggest that either would be confirmed town.<br></div></blockquote><br>And this has already been addressed, more or less.<br><br>The rest of your defense holds up. The tone of how you interacted with PC read upon review as you viewing him as scummy, though now that I'm looking in more detail I suppose I was wrong about that. However, I do believe that this post is still your first mention of PC so far during day 2. What is your opinion of him, and why? What did PB's flip have to say about PC's alignment?<br><blockquote><div><cite>DLC wrote:</cite>Well, if I do I don't do it using your approach. (Not going say my reads on them yet. I don't have time for full reads till after finals end on Friday.)I'm not I don't generally pick three people and declare that one must be scum. Not in day 2 without a scum flip.<br></div></blockquote><br>True, because most day 2's don't begin with the kind of fire that we saw on this game. It just doesn't seem reasonable that the kind of fire and passion that was thrown around was ALL town motivated and ALL wrong at the same time. There just has to be scum in the mix somewhere.<br><br>I typically do round down my scum hunting targets for day 2. Most frequently, I take a look at who was on a mislynch wagon. Obviously the reasons for lynching PB were too strong to conceivably do this, and the only real information we can gain from that is by looking at who seemed to have pre-knowledge of PB flipping town.

This argument is a moot point because if scum are going to kill based on strong shared town reads (which, by the way, town doesn't really get a whole lot of - everyone tends to have differing reads) then you can be damned sure the protecting roles will do the same. Thus eliminating any power giving these town reads up offers to the mafia, while maintaining its usefulness to the town.

What is this connection?<br></div></blockquote><br>Not a connection. Just frustrating! I felt like I really found scum and no one has touched what I've said.<br><br>In regards to the believing it, it was not 100%. It was about 80%, though, and in hindsight I probably should have doubted more. The reason I believed is because it was really damn convincing. Equinox isn't exactly one to flake from a game, so how everything played out looked really genuine to me. Hiding in the shadows a little, then the comment about needing the mod, everything fooled me pretty good.<br><br>Plus I'm not particularly familiar with what is and what is not allowed under \"normal\" rules, since I never saw one before it seemed like they aren't used. I started to doubt more (as stated) once I saw Gooner claim having a one night vig shot, as there being a pair of one bullet vigs seems unlikely.<br><br>Also, unlike other claims, this one really had no upside of really doubting. The kill or lack of kill would very quickly confirm or deny the action. Should someone, for example, throw out a cop claim and force us to act upon something we won't know the certainty of until there is a flip, doubting is a bit more healthy.<br><br>Anyways, I believe Gooner's claim personally, for previously stated reasons. Not 100%, but like SB said he's the closest thing we have to confirmed town right now. That is why I will put my vote exactly back where it belongs:<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote FakeGod</span>.<br><br>The reason I had unvoted is because FG dropped PR tells. Looking at his initial vote, it looked (in retrospect after going back and reading it again) a lot like a cop vote, then twice suggesting that if I was a townie it would make a lot of sense. I thought about those statements a lot, and the only possible explanation I could come up with is FG was a cop/watcher/tracker and had information that Gooner was scum. Now that we have information to suggest that this isn't true, and that Gooner didn't target CMAR (thus denying the possibility of a water/tracker catching him), FG is quite clearly scum."}

Just from December 2010 (when normalcy reviews became mandatory) to approximately November 2011, 1 game utilized a mafia jack-of-all-trades and 5 games utilized a town jack-of-all-trades. All 6 were 12- or 13-player games. For the games for which I had the information, the powers for the town jacks-of-all-trades varied as follows:<br><br><ul><li> Investigate, kill, roleblock</li><li> Gunsmith, roleblock, track</li><li> Investigate, kill, protect, roleblock</li><li> Investigate, kill, track</li></ul>Basically, what Gooner claimed isn't far-fetched balance-wise.

The vig kill would likely result in a dead townie and would probably be more useful in the end game when it could be used if we had a dipole. It was clearly a bad Night 1 choice. The protect was far too valuable to be used in the early game too when it could be used to protect a townie with a vital power role later in the game. <br><br>So, it was between the Cop and the Role-blocker. I was stuck between the two. The reason why I didn't choose the Cop was because I didn't have too many good reads and I wanted to use it when it could make me certain about a suspect as scum or as a townie. I felt that I would have a better read of a useful cop investigation on Night 2 than on Night 1. For example, if I were using my investigation tonight, I would use it on sorasgoof because he hasn't posted enough for us to get a good read on him. Meanwhile none of the other players seemed lurky or that we had a lack of information on them on Day 1, particularly when Jackal was replaced. Of course there was PB but he had been lynched. Basically, none of the players looked like an ideal investigation target to me. <br><br>I decided to role-block pieceofpecanpie because he seemed to be bandwagoning a bit and, although active, wasn't posting much that was controversial. I also thought that the Roleblock wouldn't be as useful as the vig kill or the doc protect in the end game so I decided to use it early on."}

I like this.<br>Post 577- I agree, mostly. I don't believe Hiraki is scum, but I don't have much of a read on him either way yet. While CMAR's reads are of some importance, I don't think you can really use that in a case. The end of this post is hurting my head, so you'll have to forgive me for not analyzing it.<br>Post 578- I like this a lot. You bring up what I believe are solid points. Also, cases made by scum are obviously going to be distorted. If you're following a case made by someone you think is scum, there's something wrong there.

What possible reason? If they're lurkers, you have no reason to vote for them. I've seen you mention a case on someone, but it must have been really inconsequential. I don't remember seeing it.<br>Post 608- First point is horrible. Also, did you really not know PB was a Vanilla Townie going into today?<br>Post 610- I actually really like this post for some reason.

It reads as if he actually knows what gooner is going to flip and is already just moving his vote to the next spot instead of waiting to see not only if the claim is true or not, but what becomes of it.  To have it make sense one would have to believe that he is going to be voting the same way regardless of what the flip from gooner is going to be, in which case why was he even voting him to start?

The vig kill would likely result in a dead townie and would probably be more useful in the end game when it could be used if we had a dipole. It was clearly a bad Night 1 choice. The protect was far too valuable to be used in the early game too when it could be used to protect a townie with a vital power role later in the game. <br><br>So, it was between the Cop and the Role-blocker. I was stuck between the two. The reason why I didn't choose the Cop was because I didn't have too many good reads and I wanted to use it when it could make me certain about a suspect as scum or as a townie. I felt that I would have a better read of a useful cop investigation on Night 2 than on Night 1. For example, if I were using my investigation tonight, I would use it on sorasgoof because he hasn't posted enough for us to get a good read on him. Meanwhile none of the other players seemed lurky or that we had a lack of information on them on Day 1, particularly when Jackal was replaced. Of course there was PB but he had been lynched. Basically, none of the players looked like an ideal investigation target to me. <br><br>I decided to role-block pieceofpecanpie because he seemed to be bandwagoning a bit and, although active, wasn't posting much that was controversial. I also thought that the Roleblock wouldn't be as useful as the vig kill or the doc protect in the end game so I decided to use it early on.</div></blockquote><br>Do you realize how invaluable knowing any one player's alignment is early game?<br><br>I agree that doc protect and vig could wait.

POPP does nothing too, still, and Majiffy doesnt look as bad due to a couple areas but only shift down the shortlist.<br><br>I do think Gooner is more town than before, as if you read his arguements regarding confirmed town in the spat with Hikari, it matches up to his theory later. His theory is wrong-ish but its his theory and not a scumtell.<br><br>Yay college majors (anypony need a recently graduated and currently unemployed civil engineer?)<br><br>FG pushing on Ice for calling him town without having posted it or something to that sort is REALLY wierd.  It just doesnt feel natural for town to be all uppity about that.  No matter what Ice is I still love him for being the only pony who is sane in this game.  He is probably town though so thats awesome.<br><br>Given the response from Ice, he is only scum if Gooner is scum for the \"I think you hit scum\" which is really odd to come from scum if Gooner is town, when he haddent previously supported that lynch.  Some town points to Equinox for that one too... this is like AJ being all lurky again, where she was town.<br><br>SB/PC is reversed, if Gooner is scum, he is town.  Other way around does not necessarily apply.<br><br>DCL hands back all those town points I gave him with the Equinox vote.  It a small town tell to make a play like that, since it can make a lynch really hard to pull off with certain responses.  I think ive only done that as town too, if I have done it as scum I cant remember it but I can think of two games right off the top of my head ive made that move as town.<br><br>I see no way Gooner is scum outside of there being an Encryptor and at least one really decent scum player on his team.  Even then chances are low.<br><br>Ok im done reading at this point.  Scum pool for me is way bigger than I normally get at end of reads so thats all awkward coming out with varying degrees of it on POPP, Majiffy, SB, Hikari, DCL and FG.  Usually I only have a few scum reads so this might be more work than I want to deal with, im a bit lazy there.  Hikari and PoPP are probably my top two reads though, if FG is doing what he might be doing im more OK with him but would rather he stop.<br><br>Good news is Ice and Gooner are town, Equinox probably, so the four of us can just band together and rock this game with an alliance.

I was so sure either FG or Gooner (or both) was going to die. That's why I tried to use it to trap Gooner in to claiming to have shot him, but as you said someone must have picked up on a non-existent or faked PR tell or something. I pretty much believe Gooner's JOAT claim at this point, assuming FG is indeed scum. <br><br>In a quick look over SB's accusations during day 2, his vote was simply all over the place. He suspected too many people too weakly for anyone to want to kill him over that, unless he nailed the entire scum team (FG, Equinox, and Rainbowdash actually kind of makes sense), but even that seems a bit far fetched.<br><br>In a quick glance over his ISO I really can't see anything that would indicate PR. And wow, I just remembered SB replaced PC, who was pretty scummy. You're right in that scum probably could have pushed a wagon on SB simply based on PC's actions.<br><br>What happened last night? Could it be possible that there's a JK or someone who was trying to prevent Gooner from shooting FG (I.E. felt FG was a town) and scum tried to shoot Gooner? Then SB was either a vig or SK kill? It's probably too early to start talking about a mass claim, but maybe I was too quick in ruling out the possibility of another killing player. The more I think about it, the less it makes sense for SB to have been targeted by scum last night.<br><br>I'm probably thinking in to this too deeply. What's most likely is that FG is scum, Gooner is indeed a JOAT who was role blocked, and scum fired off a shot on SB because he either suspected multiple members of the scum team or PC previously gave off a PR tell. Too much NK speculation will probably hurt us in the long run, so I'll try to focus more on concrete stuff like vote counts and wagon behaviors."}

Seriously. This is the DUMBEST argument I have heard yet. Town DOESN'T want claims? Then, please inform me, for what POSSIBLE reasons do you even vote your scum reads? I want my scum reads voted and put UNDER PRESSURE, FORCING THEM TO MAKE A CLAIM. I want them to make a stand so that they have to LIE about something that can be proven against them. In fact, NONE of your argument above makes any sense. You're suggesting that players should use the fact that they are PR as some kind of Get-Out-Of-Jail-Free card. Unless in extremely ROLE-SPECIFIC CASES, being a PR <span class=\"noboldsig\">DOES NOT GIVE YOU PERMISSION TO PLAY SCUMMY</span>. You should NEVER rely on PR claim to save you from a lynch. If you PLAYED BADLY, then you DESERVE THAT LYNCH. It's that simple. NEVER expect people to just believe your claim. Scum CAN AND WILL LIE about their role when they're put at L-1. I'm not suggesting that mass claiming is the way to go in every situation. I'm saying that if you're a PR, you should recognize the fact that you're valuable to the town and act like it. That is the truth."}

Don't vote rashly today. It only takes one townie to throw a vote down on another townie for the scum to win this. <br>2. This is where I stand in regards to voting data. By all means, colour yourself in blue and de-colour me if you wish. <br>3. Day 1:<br>   ICENinja, DCL and Senjai are the ones who are still alive who are on the PB lynch whose alignment I don't know. I think at least one of them is scum. <br>ICENinja: I remember that he pushed the PB fairly hard when he came in as a replacement. I would expect no more and no less from an experienced player like him no matter what his alignment is.  <br>DCL: See above<br>Senjai: Seemed like a newbie who was trying hard to get things done and was giving his opinion. I'm placing him as a townie for now. <br>Also of interest to me are the no voters. Equinox, Majiffy and Hiraki. I think that one or maybe 2 of them are scum. <br>Equinox: Has hyper-lurked his way through the day and is definitely high on my suspicious list. <br>Majiffy: I think he's a townie. He irritates me but I do think he's giving his opinion and is trying, which is more than I can say for a lot of the players in this game. <br><br>4. Day 2:<br>On the FG bandwagon, I'm looking at ICE and Hiraki. I suspect that ICE was pushing the lynch from his position as a town leader. Hiraki was the mindless bandwagoner on the bandwagon. His reasoning wasn't great and I said that I would look at him if FG came up as town. <br>On the Popp bandwagon, Equinox as scum fits well. Once again, his logic was.... interesting:<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4043949#p4043949\" class=\"postlink\">post 881</a>, Equinox wrote:</cite><span class=\"noboldsig\">Unvote, Vote: pieceofpecanpie</span></div></blockquote><br>Although point out if I've missed something about your logic. <br><br>5. Day 3:<br>FG was a townie. This surprised me. Again we have ICE pushing the lynch from the town leader position. I don't like his suggestion of a dipole between myself and FG but I didn't mind it yesterday. Now that I know FG was a townie, it fits as scum setting up two townies for the lynch in a row which would guarantee the scum victory. <br>I also think Hiraki is a scum on his bandwagon. Again he pushed the lynch without really contributing to the discussion and seemed very eager to ensure that the lynch happened very quickly. <br>Finally, Equinox. He was no voting again, which I don't like because it means that you don't really put your opinions in the thread. You're avoiding controversy and bandwagons. This makes me suspicious of him and his lurking seals it. <br><br>So my scumteam at the moment is Equinox, ICE and Hiraki. I think myself and Rainbowdash (Senjai) are my most certain townies. DCL and Majiffy I'm unsure about but I find Equinox worse than Majiffy so he's probably more certain as a townie than DCL is."}

For this to be true it would not be Equniox or Gooner due to the no result actions.  I think the went nowhere is a very slight town tell to Equinox as well, as it always is when a no action result is returned from tracker as on average one scum role (minus killer, minus active PR) doesnt act in your average normal game.  Quite a few more VTs dont act each night, assuming one claimed VT is scum RB and one scum who killled... 1 scum no actioned as compared to six town.  Even worse case two scum no actioned, getting a \"nowhere\" is a 75% chance of being on town.<br><br>Either way... I think that Gooner-scum would have done something N2, either as an active role or the one who submitted a kill.  If he gets JKed... hey he got protected.  If he gets watched/tracked it takes PR town down with him.<br><br>The Equniox thing is heavy true though, if we reach a situation where Gooner is confirmed town and there are two dead non-RB scum, Equniox is confirmed town.  If a RBer flips all bets are off.<br><br>I know where im thinking the lynch is today."}

Is it possible that the day 1 lynch only had a single scum on it? Or is it DCL + Rainbow + one of Majiffy, Equinox and Hiraki?

You're comparing apples to oranges. Asking someone who they suspect may or may not be a quick question, depending on how caught up the person is; however, if they haven't caught up or have not done any analysis in a while, answering a question of \"Who would you vote?\" could take upwards of 2-3 hours, and that's a low estimate for a thread as big as this one.

If we lynch the role blocker today, scum is caught between 2 crappy situations: leave Gooner alive and give us a chance to shoot if we get a mislynch (essentially meaning if we mislynch tomorrow Gooner can shoot, and if it hits scum then we get an extra day of 2 town 1 scum) or leave me alive and give me a fairly high likelihood of tracking the person who shot Gooner.<br><br>Both of these situations significantly improve town's chances of winning."}

This doesn't seem like how scum would distance themselves to me.<br><br>However, this is interesting. DCL and Hiraki are voting for each other. The game is not over. Ergo, they cannot both be town. My vote is on DCL as well, and the game is not over. This makes me feel really confident about my vote, actually. I'm pretty sure I'm right on this one. When DCL flips scum, I may reconsider my scum read of Hiraki as well. I'll look at their interactions more in-depth."}

We're still OK and for once I actually got things right.<br><br>So let me explain my thought process for a second here: Originally I thought either I was going to be role blocked or NKed, and that I should just throw out a random track because it doesn't matter. However, as I thought about things, I realized that my track on Gooner during night 2 (that revealed him going nowhere) told me something interesting: scum has NO active power role. If there are only 2 scum, then in a standard setup a role blocker would not be able to send in the kill, and they'd BOTH be going somewhere!<br><br>Then I also realized that if scum night killed me, it would confirm beyond a shadow of doubt that Gooner is scum, and he would be the lynch, so scum NEEDED me alive one more night. But they couldn't role block me. I initially thought to try and catch Gooner's partner in the track, thinking about who it could be. I realized the likelihood of Equinox being Gooner's buddy is just about nothing (as Equinox was tracked nowhere on night 1 and Gooner was tracked nowhere on night 2), and there is almost assuredly the other scum buddy (looks like it has to be either Rainbow or Hiraki) sending in the kills.<br><br>HOWEVER, scum must have realized this too, and must have kept their still as of yet unknown scum buddy (which, as I've previously stated, is almost certainly Rainbow or Hiraki) safe, and had Gooner send in the kill.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">So I tracked Gooner. And he went RIGHT to Majiffy last night</span>.<br><br>After an entire game of screwing up, I think I've finally figured things out. My guess for the scum team is obviously Gooner with Hiraki as the buddy. I'll obviously be night killed tonight so if I can I'll spend a little time today taking a look at Rainbow and Hiraki to see if I can offer any insight for the final lynch. Fortunately, you guys are going to be going in to the final day with Equinox as close to confirmed town as you can, so we've got at worst a 50/50 of taking this home.<br><br>This setup makes a lot more sense to me now, as 2 goons against a town this weak seems to make so much more sense than any of the possibilities with that crazy strong JOAT in it. Also, a 2 man scum team is the only instance where I've personally seen scum given daytalk, so it's certainly possible they've had that all along. I won't speculate too much on that, though.<br><br>So obviously <span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote Gooner</span>, but I ask that we don't speedlynch this guy, just so I can do my due process to insure I'm not stupidly asking you guys to lynch Hiraki tomorrow."}

He was not going to vote on me. So why on earth would I kill him?<br>2. I'm pretty sure that most of you think that Hiraki is the last scum here. Look at the way I went after him and he went after me at the start of Day 2. We went after each other hard. Do you really think that that was scum distancing?<br>3. Look at how ICE had his vote on a townie for an extremely long time yesterday. A vote on a townie gained no immediate traction and we know that the final vote was by a townie. In other words, ICE saw that Hiraki was the most likely lynch yesterday and stepped in to save him by shifting the attention to DCL instantly. It then took me a long time to put on a vote which was not the deciding vote. Why would I do that as scum? Why not let another townie put the vote down before me. <br>4. Scum roleblocker and Daytalk makes sense to me. They could even have a Godfather too. After all, we have only had a Doctor and a JOAT on our side.

Everyone knew that today would come down to you vs. me. If I tracked your buddy and survived the lynch today, then town auto wins. Your buddy still has a chance after you die, as only Equinox is confirmed town (more or less) by my death. Either Hiraki or Rainbowdash would be putting themselves at GREAT risk to be tracked, whereas you either are lynched today or win the game today. It would make ABSOLUTELY NO sense for anyone other than you to send in the kill.<br><br>Especially since after you are lynched, your buddy is free to night kill me (as my death will no longer confirm any scum, as it would have last night) and not be at risk of being tracked."}

He said it was a ploy and I had nothing outside of that one action to decide whether it was a ploy or not so I felt like my vote on him was no longer justified since he had a townie motivation for his actions. <br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3969661#p3969661\" class=\"postlink\">This post</a> also looks like an attempt of town placation to remove pressure on him.</div></blockquote><br>How? <br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>His next move, directly following this quote:<br><blockquote><div><cite>Gooner wrote:</cite>As for my vote, I'll wait a little bit longer until I throw one down.<br></div></blockquote><br>is to vote for a lurker. Considering how cautious keeps claiming to be, he votes. However, it's for an easy target. This by itself isn't exactly scummy, but considering the overall trend I'm seeing here makes sense. Hindsight is 20/20 after all.<br><br>I can't really fault Gooner for his attacks on Prolapsed, as they were legitimate. I felt the same way. It was an easy target, though. Scum was definitely on that wagon.</div></blockquote><br>I had no real reasons to vote for someone as a lynch vote, so I decided to throw down a pressure vote on a lurker to make them talk and to try to engage with them and get some idea about which faction they were. The vote worked, in a way, because Prolapsed did some in and start talking and did slip up. It was a pressure vote to make a lurker talk and, in that regard, it was successful. Unfortunately PB was a townie who did something scummy. <br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Day 2, a lot of the interactions between Gooner and Hiraki seem like distancing. Hiraki was never in any real danger, and it would have certainly diffused suspicion of Hiraki should the lynch gone through on Gooner as it looked like it might. This isn't inherently scummy, but knowing Gooner's alignment it makes me feel a little better about guessing the scum team.<br><br>That being said, I'm noting a very distinct lack of interaction between Gooner and your slot. That works as distancing too. I'll investigate further associative tells later.<br><br>Good lord reading Gooner's posts is painful. Dude you seriously need to press the preview button and stop doubleposting.<br><br>The back and forward between Gooner and Hiraki during day 2 is just awful. Even if both members of this were town, it would be bad play. I'm actually starting to second guess my bus theory here, as this is a little more than scum are usually comfortable with.</div></blockquote><br>I tried to push Hiraki's lynch and it's not my fault that nobody else followed up on it. I tried to build a case on him and I get the impresssion that a few people were skimming and not reading my posts.<br><br>As for the lack of engagement between myself and Senjai (Rainbowdash's slot) it's quite hard to engage with someone who isn't there, like Senjai. I did try to engage with him but he never returned after his vote on me. <br><br>Yeah, I've learned my lesson about using the Preview button. <br><br>Day 2 got a bit crazy and I think that a few people, myself included, are responsible for that. <br> <br><br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I really dislike Gooner's jump to Majiffy. This seems like more self-preservation here. Especially since we've seen quite a few examples of Gooner attacking townies who suspected him. I can't exactly put quotes or link posts as it's a lot of back and forward, so I'm going to suggest you just read the interactions yourself.</div></blockquote><br>Well, that's easily explained. Majiffy was trying to make my lynch happen as quickly as possible. Basically I saw it as him trying to clinch a lynch on a townie, so I voted for him. <br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Then Gooner jumps back to Hiraki. It's obvious that pushing Majiffy isn't getting anywhere. Then comes the vote for FG, which now that I look back on it, is MUCH MUCH worse than I originally realized.</div></blockquote><br>My vote on Majiffy as only there for about 24 hours. How could I have known that the vote was not going anywhere in such a short space of time? Moreover, the reason why I unvoted is because Majiffy showed me a townie reason behind his actions. Therefore my reason for voting him no longer became a definite scumtell so I switched my vote. <br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>It's all in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4019120#p4019120\" class=\"postlink\">this post</a>. Now don't get me wrong, I agreed that FG's post was the scummiest in the game up until that point, but Gooner's total 360 reversal from significant arguments away from who I think is his most likely scum buddy just screams scum trying to save not only himself but the team.<br></div></blockquote><br>FG's vote was mega-scummy and it threw him right to the top of my scumlist. I then spent the remainder of that day and all of Day 3 trying to get him lynched because I found his vote and his lack of engagement as scummy. Then on Day 4 I went right back to Hiraki as my favourite suspect before being foolishly persuaded by your argument against DCL combined with the false logic that since I thought you were a townie and he hadn't been lynched yet that either you or he was scum. Therefore I voted for him because I thought you were a townie."}

In the scenario where Gooner is scum, the optimal play would be to let ICEninja track, turning the following Day into a \"he said, she said\" standoff on the logic that scum should not be letting trackers getting guilty results so close to home base. It's the same for the scenario where ICEninja is scum; Gooner wasn't going to shoot, so letting Gooner have a go would lead to the same result above had Gooner performed a confirmable action. The situation is slightly stickier for scum if it's both Gooner and ICEninja, but I can still see this working as a gambit.<br><br>That said, I'm not sure how much I buy a Gooner-ICEninja team if I'm looking at this from the standpoint of just setup, as that means we have 1 doctor versus 2 goons or, at the most, one very low-powered scum role and a goon. This is nearly vanilla. While it might be balanced, somehow I don't think that's what chauchaudotcom have gone for.

Nevertheless, I can't rule it out, so I'll look into their interactions a little later.<br><br>Arguing over whose setup between Gooner's and ICEninja's proposals makes more sense is starting to feel like a fool's errand because both the doctor + tracker proposal and the doctor + strong jack-of-all-trades proposal can be balanced with varying degrees of elegance.

Okay, yeah, let's pretend this didn't happen.<br><br>So the LyLo where the cross voters have cases on each other that are both loaded with confirmation bias is the best kind of LyLo.

Looking again at what Rainbowdash had on Hiraki, that rules out Hiraki as scum, as that's not something scum would even think of faking. Rainbowdash catching that makes him more likely to be town, as well, so that leaves me holding the Gooner-ICEninja ball. On the one hand, pulling a cross bus like this is insane. On the other hand, it's actually the only move they can do given the claims they'd made. Remind me to pay attention to how they reacted to each other's claims.

And with a sound of a bang, the two mafia members walked off into the sunset.  <br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;\">GAME OVER: MAFIA WIN!</span></span></span><br><br>Gooner, </span></span><span style=\"color: #0000FF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Town JOAT</span></span><span style=\"color: #800000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">, has been lynched.<br>Hiraki, </span></span><span style=\"color: #008000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Vanilla Townie</span></span><span style=\"color: #800000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">, has been killed endgame.<br>RainbowDash, </span></span><span style=\"color: #008000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Vanilla Townie</span></span><span style=\"color: #800000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">, has been killed endgame. <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Voting</span><br><span style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Gooner (3) - ICEninja, Hiraki, Equinox</span></span><br>ICEninja(1) - Gooner<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Not Voting</span><br>RainbowDash<br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic\">With 5 alive, it takes 3 to lynch.</span><br></span></span>"}

The last 2 times I've played as scum I was the day 1 lynch so I figured I should do everything wrong and it somehow worked for me.<br><br>Equinox wanted to let Gooner kill FG and kill Gooner, but I knew that town was going to have weaker power roles than normal since there was only 2 of us, and I was pretty sure I could pull off a JK fake claim. After we got the doc flip (and we killed soras because of <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4072382#p4072382\" class=\"postlink\">this post</a>) I figured town wouldn't buy having a doctor, a JK, and a JOAT with both doctor and role blocker.<br><br>Upon retrospect, I think it would have been better to just damn well let Gooner shoot FG, and let town think they were in a mylo situation and push the no lynch, it would have been safer. However, the situation allowed me to fake claim so believably that it worked out like gold that we took Gooner to lylo.<br><br>I gotta admit though, Rainbow you made me nervous as hell. I did NOT want to take you to lylo, but we were forced to because Majiffy saw right through everything I said, and you decided towards the end of day 4 that I was telling the truth and that Gooner probably wasn't.<br><br>Equinox replaced in to a pretty damn scummy slot, and lurked probably the 100% optimal amount. She made just enough quality posts to keep off people's lurker hunting radars, but definitely didn't say enough to contribute to the game. I actually want to personally thank Equinox for joining this game. I know how busy you were for a while there, and that your lurking actually had nothing to do with being scum, and you pretty much joined this game as a favor to me, so I really just wanted to express that I appreciated it. If a lameo got replaced in to your slot and got lynched early on I would have been so screwed to do that all by myself."}
