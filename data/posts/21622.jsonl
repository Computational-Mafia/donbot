It was an exciting event, one many had been anticipating to attend all year. And finally the time had come. But of course, things were never as wonderful as the guests had hoped for. The mansion was located on a deserted island only accessible by ferry. Upon arrival, they noted how omnious the whole area was. Many were shocked at their surroundings, their extravagent expectations shattered within mere seconds. Murmurs of discomfort quikcly spread. \"It'll be okay guys. Come on now, I'm sure it's better once we're inside..\"  One of them commented nervously, trying to qwell the tension, though the uncertainty within her own voice was quite apparent. The group looked behind them, watching as the ferry quickly disappeared into the horizon.

Play nice and be respectful. Most importanty, have fun!<br>\n2. Do not discuss this game outside of this thread. On this site or off, we adopt a strict Vegas policy aka what goes on here, stays here.<br>\n3. Do not quote any PMs that I send to you. Doing so will get you mod killed.<br>\n4. There is to be no editing of posts.<br>\n5. Do not use any language other than English or any type of hidden, invisible or hard to read font.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Voting</div><br>\n1. All votes must be in bold like so: <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: You</div>. Votes that are not bolded will not be counted.<br>\n2. Similarly, you may unvote by typing <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Unvote: You</div>. Unvoting before a Vote is not required but those who do so will get cookies.<br>\n3. You may choose to Vote: No Lynch if you do not wish to lynch anyone that day.<br>\n4. A successful lynch requires a majority of votes (half the number of living players + 1). Once majority is reached, all other vote changes will be disregarded. Players (even the one who was lynched) may talk during Twilight.<br>\n5. If you are dead, you are dead. But since I am nice I will let you become a zombie and have one non-game related \"Bah!\" post. <br>\n6. If no majority is reached by deadline, no lynch will occur.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Activity &amp; Deadlines</div><br>\n1. I will stick by a (7 + # of living players) policy for days. Nights will always be 72 hours. All deadlines are in Pacific Time.<br>\n2. Deadline extensions will only be given in extreme cases at the mod's disgression.<br>\n3. Players who do not post for 72 hours will receive a prod. After two unsuccessful prods I will replace you.<br>\n4. If your lack of activity becomes a constant problem throughout the game, I will replace you. You may proceed to complain to me afterwards and in return I will proceed to ignore you.<br>\n5. If you know you will be absent for more than two days, please use V/LA to let me know.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Mod Rules</div><br>\n1. Breaking a rule will result in a warning. Break another rule and I will mod kill you in the most painful way possible.<br>\n2. In the chance that I make a mistake please let me know asap so I can correct it!<br>\n3. <div style=\"display:inline;color:#800000\">Dark red</div> is my color. Use it and I cannot garuntee your safety =O.<br>\n5. If you need my attention, bold it. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Mod: Hail the almighty Chau</div><br>\n6. Feel free to ask questions for clarification or anything else via Mod: tag or PM.  I will do my best to answer promptly and whatnot.<br>\n*Remember that as mod I have final say on all matters.

You have enough of a read on the interactions between the two to judge that one of those two must be scum, but not enough of one to pick one or the other? Or even provide an FOS on either of them? And given that you have yet to vote this game, why not just pick one of them at random, at the very least? <br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3962796#p3962796\" class=\"postlink\">#51</a>- Appeal to experience.

I might agree if he had his vote on one of them, or anybody for that matter, but I hate the fact that he's refusing to vote one, after saying that he gets scumvibes from both. He has yet to comment on anything else that's occurred on the game thus far, and I fail to see how voting wouldn't pressure the players and encourage discussion. Feels like distancing to me, and your defending him is draining your pro-town cred. I'd recommend you stop that. <br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3962838#p3962838\" class=\"postlink\">#56</a>- fair enough, thanks for explaining. Now... why do you have to \"see how things go\" before voting one of them again? It's not like you have any better cases to push, or even have commented on any other events in the game.

Hiraki isn't buddying with soras in that comment; he's saying that he feels that your behavior towards him is scummy. Just as I do. And why would it never get a serious wagon on soras? And if you voted him so that he would give his case... why are you still voting him? <br>\n<br>\nI don't completely follow Senjai's thought process when he's responding to soras in #62.

What are your current reads on Senjai and Cry? <br>\n<br>\nSoras- Why do you have to \"see how things go\" before voting one of them [PC/Hiraki] again? It's not like you seem to have any better cases to push.

Some examples on how I think they can do this by posting regularly, initiating invalid/pre-discussed arguments or random accusations or simply changing the topic at hand. Another method would not be posting at all and simple voting (lurking) or bandwagoning without much reason or explanation if that member knows the target of the bandwagon is a townie. These would be things I would look for, it's also one of the reasons why I slightly suspect Hiraki. In hindsight it's fairly obvious as to why the NL wouldn't work, but I explained my previous intentions for the NL in an earlier post.<br>\n<br>\nIn post 62 the tl;dr of it was: I changed my vote simply because I liked Political's tone moreso than crys, which almost seemed outright aggressive. I go on to state that I believe I shouldnt blatantly throw around votes so easily and am aiming to make more decisive and sound votes and change them less often.<br>\n<br>\nIn the latter of the post I mention I feel like PC and Hiraki feel scummy to me. Most of this is gut feeling. While sarcasm is not a scum read, with absence of additional information the abundant use of it by Hiraki worries me. I do not know him as a person, but his aggressive and almost teasing banter with soros leans me to think of him as a scummier guy, at least with the information we have at hand. It was as if he was begging for a fight in my opinion. I think that soros was simply defending himself, and I'm pretty neutral to him. <br>\n<br>\nWhile I admire your knowledge of logical fallacies (strawman and AtE) my initial vote change was just an appeal to ethos one. And believe, given the agressive nature of Hiraki's posts that he may have felt insulted as if he didnt know how to play, in which his appeal to experience was simply to say: \"I do know how to play and don't say otherwise\" should he have perceived his comments that way. It was not imo a way to dodge or get out of a situation.", "time": "Tue Apr 10, 2012 6:51 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=21622&start=75", "forum": "53", "thread": "21622"}

The thing I dislike about Jackal in particular is the fact that he felt comfortable actually casting a vote.

Please slow down.\" Jackal not only didn't comment on the speed of the game, didn't comment on any of the content, and didn't say that he wasn't done reading, yet voted based on P1 information. That, to me, was indicative that he HAD read the thread. Now, maybe he didn't read past page 1- I can't deny the possibility. But the fact that he didn't say anything about not being caught up, or complain about how difficult it was FOR him to keep up, gives me the indicator that yeah, he might be caught up. I could be wrong, and that scumread will become null once it's CONFIRMED that I'm wrong. Until them, I feel comfortable with my assertion.

It's easy to note that when your in a defensive position you're more focused on proving your own innocence than contesting his, this could be a scum tactic or could be completely irrelevant.

It's like a feeling of when I'm town and I've tried to refute any case against me, but they just ignore it and keep voting me and I feel helpless and don't understand why.<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Political Clout wrote:</cite>can someone explain why hiraki is town?

Or a replacement?</div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#800000\">They never picked up their role.  I'm in the process of looking for a replacement.</div><br>\n<br>\nI hate that during the DCL-soras exchange, DCL tries to say that no active player replied to his \"question\" of if they thought who was scummy when, indirectly, everyone did. There is currently a wagon on one of the players and people have stated reads on the other.<br>\n<br>\nI also personally don't find the ad hom stuff to be scummy. Soras clearly came into the game pissed off because he felt like the quality of play (an NL, the denying of RVS by multiple people) was awful. From his point of view, I can see him feeling like he's stuck in a newb game and therefore the adhom/standoffishness just represents that.<br>\n<br>\n@PC: I'll start with your 2nd question: The only reason I found 79 scummy, as I had stated, was because you had backed off soras and said he was town once other people started calling him town. I believe that you briefly mentioned later somewhere that you liked my reasoning behind him being protown so that point is a little moot if that's true.<br>\n<br>\nI found and still find Hiraki to be townish for a few reasons. The way he handled the soras exchange struck me as protown at the time because he started to almost retaliate against soras, telling him to take a side, but then almost defended soras saying that what PC was accusing him of wasn't scummy at all. Also, if you ISO Hiraki, his way of posting (laidback, careless, not always on the predominant topic at hand) did not strike me as scum. I'd move Hiraki to a null position at this point.<br>\n<br>\nI recall someone asking me why I felt pecan was leaning town. His first post was called out and I felt like he responded appropriately with good overall reads for the game and I also like the sarcastic sig comment he made at one point that felt like he was almost calling out DCL.<br>\n<br>\nCryMeARiver - town<br>\nDCLXVI - Just because I disagree with his case doesn't mean he's scummy, but I definitely don't find anything protown: Null<br>\ndrmyshotgun - Bad posting that should lead to scumminess, but I have this stupid feeling that is saying I believe him: Null<br>\nGooner - Defensive out the gate and don't like \"bandwagon\" wording: Scummy<br>\nHiraki - See above: Nulltown<br>\nJackal711 - Didn't come out the gate right, hasn't posted anything notable: Too soon<br>\njohnnywup - WHERE OH WHERE ARE YOU<br>\nSenjai - Newbtown<br>\nsorasgoof - Town<br>\nNihilisticNinja - Great posting, but it's either great play as scum or great play as town.

{"number": 156, "id": "3967005", "user": "NihilisticNinja", "user_id": "16709", "content": "#123 was double plus ungood. So much IIoA, and aside from a case against soras that was really weak in my opinion (soras defended himself quite well, more townpoints for him) there really isn't much there. Almost his entire case on Soras is that he's being too abrasive, which is a nulltell. There is a bit about how his \"question was scummy\", and I don't heavily disagree, but the fact that he can't explain why it was scummy gives me bad vibes. Also, feels like mild hedging there on Gooner. <br>\n<br>\nI heavily dislike shotgun's early posting, but his case on Gooner isn't bad. Getting slight townvibes, but I'll admit that there's nothing particularly concrete there. And #154-155 feel like one huge bit of deflection from Gooner- he does not respond to a single part of his case on him, <br>\n<br>\nAlso, God help me, that last post actually did give me a slight townvibe on Political. After the bland dismissal of my arguments, the fact that he's moved on to actually pressuring players and asking questions makes me think that he may be trying to generate reads now. There's still a lot I don't like about him, but I want to see further content to be sure. <br>\n<br>\nIn regards to Hiraki, mostly what Cry said. His responses to soras felt like he was genuinely trying to pressure him to pick a side and thus draw out a read. And his laidback style of posting is definitely what I would expect from a townie.

I disagree. I feel that by pressuring one of the most active players and a serious contributor, I'm calling attention to myself, because that player can respond to my case and note if they feel that my actions are not in the town's best interest, or that my case is built on bad logic. The fact that Political has not provided any sort of defense for his behavior, or provided a read on me at all, really only increases my suspicions on him. <br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nWhile your putting yourself out in the open, you did not start the wagon on Political. Initial comments by others hinted at it and you simply elaborated on it. As I said before I agree with your comments on Political, but after there has already been some scrutiny towards Political if you ever had to seriously come out against any one player it would be him. I'm not saying your wrong, but it would be the safest bet. On a side note, even though I feel Hiraki is slightly scummy, though most disagree with me (I might have to read back and see if I can come to the same point of view) he is voting for PC. Should PC be lynched and mafia that would clear me of initial suspicion of Hiraki, while if he was Town I really won't know what to think, as I too am on that wagon (at this moment).[/quote]<br>\n<br>\nIf Political is scum, that would not clear Hiraki of being scum. Even if Hiraki stayed on the wagon, scum often lynch each other. Don't see Hiraki doing that D1, but it isn't unprecedented. And I disagree that I didn't start the wagon on Political. It wasn't going much of anywhere until I voted and started pushing others to vote. The first voter is often not the wagon-starter. <br>\n<br>\nAlso, I don't recall you making a case against Hiraki. If you did, can you link to it? If not, explain it. Being I'm just not feeling it. <br>\n<br>\nAnd the last part of your post is solid, I don't really have that much to say about it.</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\nSenjai- what are your reads on DCL and Gooner at the moment?", "time": "Thu Apr 12, 2012 3:13 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=21622&start=150", "forum": "53", "thread": "21622"}

He was talking about himself, not you. Hence the \"3 people quickly jumping on a VI wagon\" right after people started voting him. Oh, and he specifically says in #151 that a \"couple of people jump on me\", and uses it to justify his Gooner vote! <br>\n<br>\nNow, let's look at your wagon. Hiraki and I vote you. Senjai votes based on a \"hunch\". I put a bit more pressure on you, and then Gooner calls you the \"bandwagon of the moment\". He says that he feels that some of the content that you have posted is scummy, but \"not enough to vote yet\". I ask why that is, and he says that it's \"nowhere near solid yet\". Pecan does basically the exact same thing that Gooner did- says that you're scummy, but not \"scummy enough to vote yet\". Then I put pressure on pecan to vote, since he says that he suspects DCL, and he accuses me of pushing people to vote because the \"PC wagon is lagging\". (Why focus on the PC wagon when you expressed suspicion on DCL and not PC)? <br>\n<br>\nCry then joins the wagon. <br>\n<br>\nWhen I continue to put pressure on Gooner asking why he refuses to vote PC, he replies that he's \"early in the day yet\". <br>\n<br>\nAnd then this is where it gets interesting: Shotty jumps on the wagon, putting PC at L-2.<br>\n<br>\nSuddenly, everybody is all over him. Sora votes him. Pecan suddenly votes him (What happened to your suspicions of DCL and shotty)? And then Gooner suddenly votes him. What makes dr \"scummy enough\" for a vote and PC wasn't?<br>\n<br>\nYeah, I really don't known why I unvoted you. <br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: DCL</span><br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Political</span>", "time": "Thu Apr 12, 2012 12:32 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=21622&start=175", "forum": "53", "thread": "21622"}

Happens to everybody at one point or another. ^^. <br>\n<br>\nAnd to trim down the wagon post, because it definitely is TL;DR- <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: Early Wagon Analysis</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\">Essentially, in my opinion, the actions on certain players don't make sense regarding the Political wagon. Hiraki, Junpei, and I vote for Political, with Cry voting later. Soras states that one of PC/Hiraki is scum, but that he doesn't feel comfortable voting with the information he has. <br>\n<br>\nThen I push for Gooner to join the wagon- he agrees that political is scummy, but says that there isn't enough there to get him to vote. I find this odd, given the fact that it would merely put Political at L-3 with no real risk for a lynch to be reached and continue to pressure, and he says that there isn't anything solid enough. <br>\n<br>\nPecan comes along with similar reasoning- they agree that Political is scummy, but that DCL is scummier, but don't vote. I ask why this is, and pecan states that there's no need for me to worry about \"pushing votes down\" because the PC wagon isn't moving. This is something I find slightly odd. After all, pecan would be voting for DCL if they voted, so why would he comment about the traction of the PC wagon? Not a big deal, just bugs me a bit. <br>\n<br>\nThen, Shotgun comes along and puts PC at L-2. A wagon instantly forms. Shotgun notes PC's 4 contentless posts, his L-2 vote, and votes him as a result. Fair enough. Then pecan jumps on, without giving any reasoning beyond a vague \"Don't like those posts\". Earlier he stated that there was no need to worry about voting or starting a wagon, and now he's quickly building momentum for a shotgun wagon based on a handful of posts, without providing any reasoning?<br>\n<br>\nGooner then jumps on with the same reasoning as the other two. He does argue later that shotgun was scummier, but I don't quite get his reasons why PC wasn't worth a vote, if shotgun was. He argues that scum \"go into the background\", and are \"calculating\" but isn't coming in and immediately putting a player at L-2 drawing attention to yourself, and extremely reckless? And if he wasn't really advancing the discussion, wasn't he really \"in the background\"? <br>\n<br>\nThis is then followed by Political's vote. Simply the shady nature of this wagon and how hard it was to get one to form on Political make me really think that it's a scum-motivated counterwagon. The Goonerwagon doesn't look much better.</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\nI hope this post was somewhat easier to digest.", "time": "Thu Apr 12, 2012 3:39 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=21622&start=175", "forum": "53", "thread": "21622"}

Senjai votes based on a \"hunch\". I put a bit more pressure on you, and then Gooner calls you the \"bandwagon of the moment\". He says that he feels that some of the content that you have posted is scummy, but \"not enough to vote yet\". I ask why that is, and he says that it's \"nowhere near solid yet\". Pecan does basically the exact same thing that Gooner did- says that you're scummy, but not \"scummy enough to vote yet\". Then I put pressure on pecan to vote, since he says that he suspects DCL, and he accuses me of pushing people to vote because the \"PC wagon is lagging\".

Thank you for picking up on Pecan. One reason why I would almost side with voting against DMS rather than Political is because Political still contributes discussion. More relevant discussion more reads. DMS is abrupt and reckless and uses hindsight to explain a lot of his actions while really not committing much to the discussion.

Hiraki, Junpei, and I vote for Political, with Cry voting later. Soras states that one of PC/Hiraki is scum, but that he doesn't feel comfortable voting with the information he has. <br>\n<br>\nThen I push for Gooner to join the wagon- he agrees that political is scummy, but says that there isn't enough there to get him to vote. I find this odd, given the fact that it would merely put Political at L-3 with no real risk for a lynch to be reached and continue to pressure, and he says that there isn't anything solid enough. <br>\n<br>\nPecan comes along with similar reasoning- they agree that Political is scummy, but that DCL is scummier, but don't vote. I ask why this is, and pecan states that there's no need for me to worry about \"pushing votes down\" because the PC wagon isn't moving. This is something I find slightly odd. After all, pecan would be voting for DCL if they voted, so why would he comment about the traction of the PC wagon? Not a big deal, just bugs me a bit. <br>\n<br>\nThen, Shotgun comes along and puts PC at L-2. A wagon instantly forms. Shotgun notes PC's 4 contentless posts, his L-2 vote, and votes him as a result. Fair enough. Then pecan jumps on, without giving any reasoning beyond a vague \"Don't like those posts\". Earlier he stated that there was no need to worry about voting or starting a wagon, and now he's quickly building momentum for a shotgun wagon based on a handful of posts, without providing any reasoning?<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nGiven Pecans relatively strong reasoning for not jumping to vote this bugs me.<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=3968546#p3968546\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=3968546#p3968546\" data-post-id=\"3968546\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 187</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=16709\">NihilisticNinja</a> wrote:</cite><br>\nGooner then jumps on with the same reasoning as the other two.

He argues that scum \"go into the background\", and are \"calculating\" but isn't coming in and immediately putting a player at L-2 drawing attention to yourself, and extremely reckless? And if he wasn't really advancing the discussion, wasn't he really \"in the background\"? <br>\n<br>\nThis is then followed by Political's vote. Simply the shady nature of this wagon and how hard it was to get one to form on Political make me really think that it's a scum-motivated counterwagon.

Recent posts have been townier, the fact that he attacked my argument, then turned around and defended me vs NN does not seem like something scum would do. <br>\n<br>\nSora-Since my argument with him his post has been somewhat better.

Jackal I think has only made one or two posts and we've not heard from him since. As aforementioned lurking is one of my preferred scumtells.

I'm not exactly a fountain of insight and observation, but here's an attempt to update.<br>\n<br>\nFirstly, I feel that my jump on <div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Gooner</div> has been too hasty. After unvoting due to the craziness and not knowing who is and isn't sticking around I'm not about to stick my vote back on him. I feel Gooner has contributed quite a bit more, been reasonably clear and logical about his reads and train of thoughts, whether that's due to the pressure placed on him or his reasons in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3969661#p3969661\" class=\"postlink\">#213</a> and <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3969894#p3969894\" class=\"postlink\">#217</a> or a mixture of both, I'm not sure.

The clout (bad pun) that others have gathered on PC is starting to sway me. Especially when coupled with my suspicions of the way the PC wagon was moving, which don't feel correct to me anymore.

Before things got messy he was still overtly defensive, was pushed hard to contribute and when he did refused to take any criticism or suspicion on board.

The SK speculation by him on the other hand does send off an alarm bell.<br>\n<br>\nOut of the 5 Cry mentioned I've been more preferential to the 3 \"active\" players he mentioned, and out of those I preferred Gooner and ICE (DMS). However, I'm not convinced about Gooner anymore, leaving me with ICE (DMS) for now and adding Prolapsed for his curious <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3978974#p3978974\" class=\"postlink\">SK suggestion</a>.<br>\n<br>\nOn an aside, I didn't like the gut reads I got from DCL's initial posts, but he seems to have tightened up and I think he's directed some really good questions at Prolapsed.

This is not comprehensive, just the things that jumped out at me the most during my initial read through.<br>\n<br>\nNihil struck me as the most town player, but several of her posts have a very \"hey guys look how town I am!\" feeling. Normally I wouldn't point this out, but as scum I've actually been (correctly) lynched almost on that logic alone. I will be in no way shape or form interested in lynching this slot today, but I feel like it's an easy slot to write off as obvtown, which is a huge mistake to do during day 1. If needed, I'll go back and find the points that made me think this.<br>\n<br>\nI'm hesitant to post this, but when I was looking at this game from a zero knowledge perspective, this felt like a really bad defense of another player to me:<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>CMAR wrote:</cite><br>\nFuck. Such bad posting from shotgun. And yet, for some eery reason, I fucking believe him when his only notable statement of the entire game has been I'm not scum. Fuck me. Shotgun, play better.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\nThen directly following, another from PC:<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>CMAR wrote:</cite><br>\nDamnit. And now I'm getting a feeling from the following post by PC. It's like a feeling of when I'm town and I've tried to refute any case against me, but they just ignore it and keep voting me and I feel helpless and don't understand why.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\nIt looks like not very genuine frustration to me, and it very well could be scum hopping off wagons or suspicions that he knows isn't safe for him to be on. I've felt CMAR to be one of the more town players overall, but I didn't like this post very much.<br>\n<br>\nPecan seems to have escaped a lot of scrutiny this game after being declared a town read by Nihil. I feel like this is a particular problem when reading <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3967037#p3967037\" class=\"postlink\">posts 158 and 158</a> sequentially. While 157 was sort of a mess, there is definite information there. He clearly states:<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Pecan wrote:</cite><br>\nBut if I had to vote someone right now, which I'm not prepared to do just yet, but if I had to it would be DCL. <br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\nwith the following reasoning:<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Pecan wrote:</cite><br>\nseem so plainly condescending that I'm not sure why they didn't draw a little more attention. There isn't much beyond my gut that would put him above some others, but it's certainly churning from that tone.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\nWhat strikes me is how he says he isn't ready to vote just yet. Right in his next post, he votes for Gooner, which is extremely weird considering in his previous post he seemed to only have minor suspicion of him. It's clear that shotgun's case against Gooner wasn't a ninja post or anything, they were hours apart, so I really don't get why the sudden change of heart <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">and a vote minutes after he said he wasn't ready to vote yet</div>. This does not sit well with me at all.<br>\n<br>\nHiraki's <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3967146#p3967146\" class=\"postlink\">post 159</a> was solidly bad for several reasons. While I agree that DLC's \"case\" on you was really bad, the way you responded to it was quite a bit worse. The rest of the post was zero analysis of things that have happened and a lot of degrading other players. Your ISO is actually quite full of this. When I have the time I'm going to delve deeper in to this, there might be something here.<br>\n<br>\nAs I've said before, <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3968201#p3968201\" class=\"postlink\">Nihil's 176</a> was the best post of this game so far. During day 1, solid reads of players are incredibly unreliable but the behavior of wagons tell many truths. A wagon that is this difficult to maintain despite the number of people who have expressed suspicion, especially considering how weak the reasoning has been for counter wagons and how interested people have been on lurker hunting instead of pressuring their suspicions genuinely makes me feel like PC is one of our really good lynch options for today. I'll present a full case on why I'd like to see him hang later on.<br>\n<br>\nProlapsed's <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3968465#p3968465\" class=\"postlink\">post 180</a> has probably been the scummiest post of the game so far. Let's take a look:<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>PB wrote:</cite><br>\nTheir interactions make me feel that at least one, and perhaps two, of them are scum. I kinda went \"eeny meeny miney moe\" and chose soras.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\nSo this is your reasoning for your stance and your vote? Seriously? \"Their interactions\" is how you're going to declare someone scummy on day 1. Brilliant. Then you pick one out at random instead of analyzing who is the most likely to be scum. Definitely playing from a survival standpoint looking for a safe place to park your vote instead of actually trying to find scum.<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>PB wrote:</cite><br>\nI just feel that hiraki/CMAR/soras are scummier as a group than PC and/or Senjai.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\nSo we're picking out whole scum teams on day 1 and voting based on interactions when we don't have flips, eh? Then we go off and discount a player as VI. Sure seems like you want to keep the focus on a specific group of players, and almost arbitrarily. Why?<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>PB wrote:</cite><br>\nThis is quite scummy. Or at least anti-town.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\nIt was anti-town for sure (and I'll get to Jackal later), but how was it scummy? You just said \"this is\" without explaining why, which is the most important part of this game.<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>PB wrote:</cite><br>\nNN is prob-town (or very crafty scum) for 113.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\nWhile I agree with your read, this is such a useless statement.<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>PB wrote:</cite><br>\nFFS this is not how you play mafia. Get real. Also, please explain what you are pointing out in post 135.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\nFunny, I haven't seen any scum hunting from you, either. Pot and kettle?<br>\n<br>\nJackal's <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3969742#p3969742\" class=\"postlink\">post 215</a> is awful awful awful. It is the one thing that would really hold me back from voting PC, and basically tells me if PC flips town, Jackal is probably scum.

I noted, however, that it took PC longer than most (bottom of page 2) to really begin any serious discussion. It seems strange that someone who would make these arguments would not seek to quickly engage in the active discussion that resulted from what we learned in the first few votes. Nothing too serious here, but worth noting. Scum always prefer to prolong real discussion a much as possible, especially if they can be perceived as active and contributing.<br>\n<br>\nPC's <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3962813#p3962813\" class=\"postlink\">post 53</a> is pretty bad. While I don't exactly like what sora was doing, PC's reaction bothered me. It felt like PC was worried about which one of himself and Hiraki would be voted and take the early spotlight, and town wouldn't worry about that. The whole exchange felt scummy to me.<br>\n<br>\nThen his next post, when confronted about voting sora, he responded with this:<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>PC wrote:</cite><br>\nwho said it was scummy? and why wouldn't I vote?<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\nSo you saw something that wasn't scummy, and you voted for it. Why wouldn't you vote? Because there was nothing scummy. Why would you undermine your own vote? Obviously if you vote someone, you're implying what they did was scummy. Otherwise why WOULD you vote? Looks like you got called out on some bad \"scum hunting\" and wanted to retract it. Who does that? Not town, that's for sure.<br>\n<br>\nThen what Hiraki tore apart the offending post in more detail than I just did, PC counters with this:<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>PC wrote:</cite><br>\nso this is the part where you buddy the guy that said one of us was scum good to know.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\nThis is attempting to undermine the argument without actually responding to it. Then the \"Meh I don't mind though\", trying to play it off cool like it doesn't bother him. Obviously, with the way he's treated the situation so far, he minds. Town doesn't try to give false impressions about their reactions, as town has nothing to hide.<br>\n<br>\nHis <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3963695#p3963695\" class=\"postlink\">post 79</a>, while not inherently scummy, shows more of his lack of scum hunting while still posting regularly.<br>\n<br>\nHis following posts seem to be doing one of two things: defending Jackal or defending himself when being scum hunted.<br>\n<br>\nHis first, and so far only, attempt at scum hunting comes in the form of <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3968076#p3968076\" class=\"postlink\">post 171</a>. He attacks Shotgun for suggesting in one post that PC is VI and suggesting in another that PC is Gooner's scum buddy. This doesn't track though, because Shotgun's reason for calling you Gooner's scum buddy were associative tells (which I hate being used day 1, but I obviously can't grill Shotgun about doing that) that had nothing to do with you individually. It wasn't a bad point, actually, but I disagree with Shotgun's case as I don't believe Gooner is scum.<br>\n<br>\nPC's vote was shot down pretty good, and his response was extremely underwhelming.<br>\n<br>\nPost 181 contains nothing but an unvote. After that he's pretty much fallen off the face of the Earth. Nihil made a freaking great argument for him being scum and after that PC just sort of vanishes. The pressure on him is having one hell of a hard time building, and if he doesn't stir the waters too much he probably feels like he could stay away from a noose for quite some time.<br>\n<br>\nI'm not having any of it.

He seems to have reasons for finding the 3 players scummy by association, but never once says what they are. He later admits to picking one of them at random to actually vote, instead of analyzing who is the most likely to be scum. This is not a town mindset at all, and indicates that he's pretending to scum hunt without actually doing it.<br>\n<br>\nI want to point out this post again:<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>PB wrote:</cite><br>\nNot much has changed for me since yesterday.<br>\n<br>\nCarry on.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\nHis next post:<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>PB wrote:</cite><br>\nThey can call me suspicious all they want.

Now you have my reads.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\nI really shouldn't have to explain why this is ridiculously scummy, ESPECIALLY since it is in sequence. Not only is he hypocritical, but he makes a very key scum slip here. He declares \"THE SCUMTEAM\" as in, these are all the players that are scum, as Jackal and FakeGod. He knows the scum team is 2 people, huh? Therefore with this knowledge of 2 people being scum in a mini of this size he'd easily come to the conclusion that there probably is a SK.<br>\n<br>\nSeriously, you don't get this kind of admittance of knowledge on a silver platter very often.<br>\n<br>\nIn defense of some questions, he makes <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3983339#p3983339\" class=\"postlink\">post 344</a>. When asked why he finds people scummy, one was \"he just seems scummy\" and the other was \"he's a replacement\". Seriously? So I'm scummy now because I'm a replacement?<br>\n<br>\nThen he backtracks hard on his guessing of there being an SK. Realistically, scum doesn't know if there is one or not so this makes perfect sense. Town, however, wouldn't even think about an SK this early in the game. Out of all the mini's I've played so far, I can only think of a single one that contained a SK. They're pretty rare. The only reason someone would consider there being one is having information that suggests there is one. Such as knowing there is a 2 man scum team, which I mentioned earlier.<br>\n<br>\nThen <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3984567#p3984567\" class=\"postlink\">post 351</a> is just so scummy I shouldn't need to explain it.

Towards the end of day 1, PC was involved in some of this as well (specifically with DLC and Gooner). I'd bet my left nut that there's scum in the mix here. As I stated before I believe between the group of DLC, Gooner, and Hiraki there can be no more than one scum. PC could potentially be scum as well along with someone in the main 3.<br>\n<br>\nTaking a look at the big picture of said clusterfuck, it doesn't really make sense for Majiffy to be scum. I don't really buy the whole point about him laying claim to PC's case (though I don't like someone sheeping a scum read unless they present evidence of a bus), and his attacks read pretty genuine to me. He also didn't start the initial trio of Gooner/DLC/Hiraki, and doesn't really track well with being a scum buddy of any of them. While he is by no means confirmed, for the purpose of this situation I'm going to assume he's town.<br>\n<br>\nHere are the following assumptions I am making to attempt to make sense of all of this:<br>\n1) Exactly one of Hiraki, Gooner, and DLC is scum.<br>\n2) Majiffy is town.<br>\n3) PC is potentially scum, but attacked both DLC and Gooner during day 1's PB wagon.<br>\n4) A standard mini of this size will probably have a 3 man scum team, leaving one of the lurkers or those not involved in this clusterfuck as the final scum. I'm liking Equinox for this.<br>\n<br>\n-PC attacked Gooner, but seemed more confident of a DLC scum flip by the end of day 1.<br>\n-DLC attacked PC during day 1 (and asserted that a PB flip would make PC even scummier, which oddly enough DLC never brought up during day 2). Once day 2 started, he began tunneling HARD on Majiffy.<br>\n-Majiffy suspected PC day 1, but also sheeped his case of Gooner. has solidly tunneled on Gooner so far for day 2.<br>\n-Gooner pushed PB most of day 1 and has been going back and forward with Hiraki for pretty much all of day 2.<br>\n-Hiraki pushed PB for a while during day 1 but sort of fell off. He votes Senjai very briefly, and votes Gooner at the start of day 2. The vote seems fairly random. Sheeps Majiffy without reason, who has presented no reason to vote, then later \"is worried\" about Majiffy, but still presses Gooner.<br>\n<br>\nI'm trying to make sense of all this, but so far I'm thinking DLC is the most likely scum in the core 3. PC's last vote switch during day 1 looks like they could potentially be connected as well. Gooner feels the least likely scum of the bunch, with Hiraki probably only being scum on the condition of a DLC town flip. I still want to see what PC has to say, but for now I'm going to park my vote here:<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Unvote, vote DLC</div>.<br>\n<br>\n I'm very willing to switch my vote to PC, and might after he posts some content for day 2 and I make a full case on him.

So already you've stated two different accounts for your \"biggest scumtell\" that he apparently did. Then you add in the bw reasoning later on after someone else mentions it, saying it was one of the reasons for your vote, yet in your vote post you call it a \"random vote\" and don't say anything about L-2 or the wagon. So which is it, active lurking or whining about activity? Which is it, a bandwagon or a random vote?<br>\n<br>\nYour story just doesn't follow one clear path.</div></blockquote><br>\nIn my opinion, \"complaining about activity\" and doing nothing else is a form of active lurking. Of course, it's not the only form of active lurking and neither is \"complaining about activity\" with useful stuff with it active lurking.

While I have interacted with them, I have stayed out of their recent spat. The only comment I made about it was something like \"I'm not impressed with either of their cases.\" Because there isn't any strong connection between me and Hiraki/Gooner.

This premiss is complete speculation. There may be scum in this , there may not be scum. We don't know either way.

This premiss is complete speculation.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\nYou can say that about pretty much any argument made at this point in the game as to why someone is scum. Just because it's speculation doesn't mean it's wrong. I could be, but it seems very likely that there is indeed one scum amongst your group.

The tone of how you interacted with PC read upon review as you viewing him as scummy, though now that I'm looking in more detail I suppose I was wrong about that.

It just doesn't seem reasonable that the kind of fire and passion that was thrown around was ALL town motivated and ALL wrong at the same time. There just has to be scum in the mix somewhere.<br>\n<br>\nI typically do round down my scum hunting targets for day 2. Most frequently, I take a look at who was on a mislynch wagon.

Flipping on your reads on the basis of one post - especially when that read is a \"strong town\" read - is suspicious activity. Mafia doesn't like to give town reads because in order for them to win they either have to kill all their town reads at night or eventually flip on these reads and push their earlier town reads as scum.

This argument is a moot point because if scum are going to kill based on strong shared town reads (which, by the way, town doesn't really get a whole lot of - everyone tends to have differing reads) then you can be damned sure the protecting roles will do the same.

What is this connection?<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\nNot a connection. Just frustrating! I felt like I really found scum and no one has touched what I've said.<br>\n<br>\nIn regards to the believing it, it was not 100%. It was about 80%, though, and in hindsight I probably should have doubted more. The reason I believed is because it was really damn convincing. Equinox isn't exactly one to flake from a game, so how everything played out looked really genuine to me. Hiding in the shadows a little, then the comment about needing the mod, everything fooled me pretty good.<br>\n<br>\nPlus I'm not particularly familiar with what is and what is not allowed under \"normal\" rules, since I never saw one before it seemed like they aren't used. I started to doubt more (as stated) once I saw Gooner claim having a one night vig shot, as there being a pair of one bullet vigs seems unlikely.<br>\n<br>\nAlso, unlike other claims, this one really had no upside of really doubting. The kill or lack of kill would very quickly confirm or deny the action. Should someone, for example, throw out a cop claim and force us to act upon something we won't know the certainty of until there is a flip, doubting is a bit more healthy.<br>\n<br>\nAnyways, I believe Gooner's claim personally, for previously stated reasons. Not 100%, but like SB said he's the closest thing we have to confirmed town right now. That is why I will put my vote exactly back where it belongs:<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote FakeGod</div>.<br>\n<br>\nThe reason I had unvoted is because FG dropped PR tells. Looking at his initial vote, it looked (in retrospect after going back and reading it again) a lot like a cop vote, then twice suggesting that if I was a townie it would make a lot of sense. I thought about those statements a lot, and the only possible explanation I could come up with is FG was a cop/watcher/tracker and had information that Gooner was scum. Now that we have information to suggest that this isn't true, and that Gooner didn't target CMAR (thus denying the possibility of a water/tracker catching him), FG is quite clearly scum.", "time": "Tue May 08, 2012 9:24 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=21622&start=750", "forum": "53", "thread": "21622"}

The vig kill would likely result in a dead townie and would probably be more useful in the end game when it could be used if we had a dipole. It was clearly a bad Night 1 choice. The protect was far too valuable to be used in the early game too when it could be used to protect a townie with a vital power role later in the game. <br>\n<br>\nSo, it was between the Cop and the Role-blocker. I was stuck between the two. The reason why I didn't choose the Cop was because I didn't have too many good reads and I wanted to use it when it could make me certain about a suspect as scum or as a townie. I felt that I would have a better read of a useful cop investigation on Night 2 than on Night 1. For example, if I were using my investigation tonight, I would use it on sorasgoof because he hasn't posted enough for us to get a good read on him. Meanwhile none of the other players seemed lurky or that we had a lack of information on them on Day 1, particularly when Jackal was replaced. Of course there was PB but he had been lynched. Basically, none of the players looked like an ideal investigation target to me. <br>\n<br>\nI decided to role-block pieceofpecanpie because he seemed to be bandwagoning a bit and, although active, wasn't posting much that was controversial. I also thought that the Roleblock wouldn't be as useful as the vig kill or the doc protect in the end game so I decided to use it early on.", "time": "Wed May 09, 2012 8:10 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=21622&start=775", "forum": "53", "thread": "21622"}

It reads as if he actually knows what gooner is going to flip and is already just moving his vote to the next spot instead of waiting to see not only if the claim is true or not, but what becomes of it.  To have it make sense one would have to believe that he is going to be voting the same way regardless of what the flip from gooner is going to be, in which case why was he even voting him to start?  The vote doesnt even have any backing but \"is acting anti-town\" which sadly isnt really good enough reason to lynch anypony on by itself.<br>\n<br>\nThen we have affirmation that you are scum regardless of what gooner is, and saying that vig should be used (which it should never be used).  I mean, its the worst out of all of the JOATs actions by miles and miles, and it usually benifits scum.<br>\n<br>\nLike I said though, I really havent read much of this game, just burned through the day two stuff last night.<br>\n<br>\nMajiffy really poking the hornets nest calling me useless though.

The vig kill would likely result in a dead townie and would probably be more useful in the end game when it could be used if we had a dipole. It was clearly a bad Night 1 choice. The protect was far too valuable to be used in the early game too when it could be used to protect a townie with a vital power role later in the game. <br>\n<br>\nSo, it was between the Cop and the Role-blocker. I was stuck between the two. The reason why I didn't choose the Cop was because I didn't have too many good reads and I wanted to use it when it could make me certain about a suspect as scum or as a townie. I felt that I would have a better read of a useful cop investigation on Night 2 than on Night 1. For example, if I were using my investigation tonight, I would use it on sorasgoof because he hasn't posted enough for us to get a good read on him. Meanwhile none of the other players seemed lurky or that we had a lack of information on them on Day 1, particularly when Jackal was replaced. Of course there was PB but he had been lynched. Basically, none of the players looked like an ideal investigation target to me. <br>\n<br>\nI decided to role-block pieceofpecanpie because he seemed to be bandwagoning a bit and, although active, wasn't posting much that was controversial.

But its productive a bit.  I really dont like Hikari that much from what I picked up, and I actually start to not mind DCL as much at this point.  POPP does nothing too, still, and Majiffy doesnt look as bad due to a couple areas but only shift down the shortlist.<br>\n<br>\nI do think Gooner is more town than before, as if you read his arguements regarding confirmed town in the spat with Hikari, it matches up to his theory later. His theory is wrong-ish but its his theory and not a scumtell.<br>\n<br>\nYay college majors (anypony need a recently graduated and currently unemployed civil engineer?)<br>\n<br>\nFG pushing on Ice for calling him town without having posted it or something to that sort is REALLY wierd.  It just doesnt feel natural for town to be all uppity about that.  No matter what Ice is I still love him for being the only pony who is sane in this game.  He is probably town though so thats awesome.<br>\n<br>\nGiven the response from Ice, he is only scum if Gooner is scum for the \"I think you hit scum\" which is really odd to come from scum if Gooner is town, when he haddent previously supported that lynch.  Some town points to Equinox for that one too... this is like AJ being all lurky again, where she was town.<br>\n<br>\nSB/PC is reversed, if Gooner is scum, he is town.  Other way around does not necessarily apply.<br>\n<br>\nDCL hands back all those town points I gave him with the Equinox vote.  It a small town tell to make a play like that, since it can make a lynch really hard to pull off with certain responses.  I think ive only done that as town too, if I have done it as scum I cant remember it but I can think of two games right off the top of my head ive made that move as town.<br>\n<br>\nI see no way Gooner is scum outside of there being an Encryptor and at least one really decent scum player on his team.  Even then chances are low.<br>\n<br>\nOk im done reading at this point.  Scum pool for me is way bigger than I normally get at end of reads so thats all awkward coming out with varying degrees of it on POPP, Majiffy, SB, Hikari, DCL and FG.  Usually I only have a few scum reads so this might be more work than I want to deal with, im a bit lazy there.  Hikari and PoPP are probably my top two reads though, if FG is doing what he might be doing im more OK with him but would rather he stop.<br>\n<br>\nGood news is Ice and Gooner are town, Equinox probably, so the four of us can just band together and rock this game with an alliance.

FG either is basically suicidal scum or town, im thinking town due to his short sightedness, at worst something like goon but my bits are all on town.<br>\n<br>\n@Majiffy - A whole lot of what I said yesteday still applies, the only reason im not fully convinced you are scum is NN looked sorta townish to me.<br>\n<br>\nMy biggest issue with you is how you start continually making statements that seem to imply that you already have lynches for the next day figured out before any lynch happens.  You did that with the PB flip and the Equinox fake vig situation.  Before the PB flip you were talking about how Gooner is the lynch for the next day.  After the fake vig you start immediately on saying that Ice is scum.  These are not things that town should really be able to do, ever.  Im trying to think and I can come up with very very few situations where I would want the same lynch regardless of what flips were.<br>\n<br>\nNext you really acted odd over the PB wagon, you unvote on \"buffer\" and then seem to rethink, but never actually move your vote, push Gooner (who should be the play according to earlier statements) and then come back with some snipey stuff at PB but never return a vote before the lynch happens.<br>\n<br>\nThe PoPP vote from you really makes no sense as well.  You haddent even mentioned him forever, and commented on the FG vote on Gooner being bad.  Then it turns into FG vs PoPP and you end up on PoPP (side note to Ice, those connected to FG are the main reason keep doubting my read) and you ended up where I least expected you to.<br>\n<br>\nThe SB death also really bugs me.  When I saw it I was 100% convinced that it was going to turn into a \"Gooner shot him, and we have to go through motions to figure if he is lying\".  The three have one most scum comes from SBs reads, he was replacing a possibly lynchable slot and named four players.  I know im town so im doubting that two of those three would kill a possible lynch who thought they were town.

I was so sure either FG or Gooner (or both) was going to die. That's why I tried to use it to trap Gooner in to claiming to have shot him, but as you said someone must have picked up on a non-existent or faked PR tell or something. I pretty much believe Gooner's JOAT claim at this point, assuming FG is indeed scum. <br>\n<br>\nIn a quick look over SB's accusations during day 2, his vote was simply all over the place. He suspected too many people too weakly for anyone to want to kill him over that, unless he nailed the entire scum team (FG, Equinox, and Rainbowdash actually kind of makes sense), but even that seems a bit far fetched.<br>\n<br>\nIn a quick glance over his ISO I really can't see anything that would indicate PR. And wow, I just remembered SB replaced PC, who was pretty scummy. You're right in that scum probably could have pushed a wagon on SB simply based on PC's actions.<br>\n<br>\nWhat happened last night? Could it be possible that there's a JK or someone who was trying to prevent Gooner from shooting FG (I.E. felt FG was a town) and scum tried to shoot Gooner? Then SB was either a vig or SK kill? It's probably too early to start talking about a mass claim, but maybe I was too quick in ruling out the possibility of another killing player. The more I think about it, the less it makes sense for SB to have been targeted by scum last night.<br>\n<br>\nI'm probably thinking in to this too deeply. What's most likely is that FG is scum, Gooner is indeed a JOAT who was role blocked, and scum fired off a shot on SB because he either suspected multiple members of the scum team or PC previously gave off a PR tell. Too much NK speculation will probably hurt us in the long run, so I'll try to focus more on concrete stuff like vote counts and wagon behaviors.", "time": "Sun May 20, 2012 4:27 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=21622&start=950", "forum": "53", "thread": "21622"}

You did that with the PB flip and the Equinox fake vig situation.  Before the PB flip you were talking about how Gooner is the lynch for the next day.  After the fake vig you start immediately on saying that Ice is scum.  These are not things that town should really be able to do, ever.  Im trying to think and I can come up with very very few situations where I would want the same lynch regardless of what flips were.<br>\n<br>\nNext you really acted odd over the PB wagon, you unvote on \"buffer\" and then seem to rethink, but never actually move your vote, push Gooner (who should be the play according to earlier statements) and then come back with some snipey stuff at PB but never return a vote before the lynch happens.<br>\n<br>\nThe PoPP vote from you really makes no sense as well.  You haddent even mentioned him forever, and commented on the FG vote on Gooner being bad.

This tracks almost perfectly with my theory of you being a role blocker, as role blockers are obviously going to spend more time and effort role fishing than others.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\nOkay. Seriously. This is the DUMBEST argument I have heard yet. Town DOESN'T want claims? Then, please inform me, for what POSSIBLE reasons do you even vote your scum reads? I want my scum reads voted and put UNDER PRESSURE, FORCING THEM TO MAKE A CLAIM. I want them to make a stand so that they have to LIE about something that can be proven against them. In fact, NONE of your argument above makes any sense. You're suggesting that players should use the fact that they are PR as some kind of Get-Out-Of-Jail-Free card. Unless in extremely ROLE-SPECIFIC CASES, being a PR <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">DOES NOT GIVE YOU PERMISSION TO PLAY SCUMMY</div>. You should NEVER rely on PR claim to save you from a lynch. If you PLAYED BADLY, then you DESERVE THAT LYNCH. It's that simple. NEVER expect people to just believe your claim. Scum CAN AND WILL LIE about their role when they're put at L-1. I'm not suggesting that mass claiming is the way to go in every situation. I'm saying that if you're a PR, you should recognize the fact that you're valuable to the town and act like it.

Don't vote rashly today. It only takes one townie to throw a vote down on another townie for the scum to win this. <br>\n2. This is where I stand in regards to voting data. By all means, colour yourself in blue and de-colour me if you wish. <br>\n3. Day 1:<br>\n   ICENinja, DCL and Senjai are the ones who are still alive who are on the PB lynch whose alignment I don't know. I think at least one of them is scum. <br>\nICENinja: I remember that he pushed the PB fairly hard when he came in as a replacement. I would expect no more and no less from an experienced player like him no matter what his alignment is.  <br>\nDCL: See above<br>\nSenjai: Seemed like a newbie who was trying hard to get things done and was giving his opinion. I'm placing him as a townie for now. <br>\nAlso of interest to me are the no voters. Equinox, Majiffy and Hiraki. I think that one or maybe 2 of them are scum. <br>\nEquinox: Has hyper-lurked his way through the day and is definitely high on my suspicious list. <br>\nMajiffy: I think he's a townie. He irritates me but I do think he's giving his opinion and is trying, which is more than I can say for a lot of the players in this game. <br>\n<br>\n4. Day 2:<br>\nOn the FG bandwagon, I'm looking at ICE and Hiraki. I suspect that ICE was pushing the lynch from his position as a town leader. Hiraki was the mindless bandwagoner on the bandwagon. His reasoning wasn't great and I said that I would look at him if FG came up as town. <br>\nOn the Popp bandwagon, Equinox as scum fits well. Once again, his logic was.... interesting:<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4043949#p4043949\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4043949#p4043949\" data-post-id=\"4043949\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 881</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=13357\">Equinox</a> wrote:</cite><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Unvote, Vote: pieceofpecanpie</div></div></blockquote><br>\nAlthough point out if I've missed something about your logic. <br>\n<br>\n5. Day 3:<br>\nFG was a townie. This surprised me. Again we have ICE pushing the lynch from the town leader position. I don't like his suggestion of a dipole between myself and FG but I didn't mind it yesterday. Now that I know FG was a townie, it fits as scum setting up two townies for the lynch in a row which would guarantee the scum victory. <br>\nI also think Hiraki is a scum on his bandwagon. Again he pushed the lynch without really contributing to the discussion and seemed very eager to ensure that the lynch happened very quickly. <br>\nFinally, Equinox. He was no voting again, which I don't like because it means that you don't really put your opinions in the thread. You're avoiding controversy and bandwagons. This makes me suspicious of him and his lurking seals it. <br>\n<br>\nSo my scumteam at the moment is Equinox, ICE and Hiraki. I think myself and Rainbowdash (Senjai) are my most certain townies.

It now seems that Gooner as a scum role blocker is implausible, but obviously if Gooner is going to fake claim JOAT he's going to want to claim to have done the most innocuous thing possible.

Quite a few more VTs dont act each night, assuming one claimed VT is scum RB and one scum who killled... 1 scum no actioned as compared to six town.  Even worse case two scum no actioned, getting a \"nowhere\" is a 75% chance of being on town.<br>\n<br>\nEither way...

Hmm. This is probably conspiracy theory, but looking at FG's lynch, it totally makes sense for there to be 1 scum on the wagon (DCL or Hiraki), one off the wagon (Rainbow) and one not voting (Equinox or Majiffy). Day 2 lynch totally makes sense for Hiraki + Rainbow + Equinox or Majiffy scum team. Day 1 I'm a little confused about, as all of Equinox, Majiffy, and Hiraki were not voting. Is it possible that the day 1 lynch only had a single scum on it? Or is it DCL + Rainbow + one of Majiffy, Equinox and Hiraki? That would point to Hiraki being less likely scum, as I'm pretty confident there is one between Majiffy and Equinox.<br>\n<br>\nHowever, any way the dice fall, you make sense as scum, with every single possible combination of partners. No one else has the most wide-spread possibility of scum buddies under any of the circumstances.

Asking someone who they suspect may or may not be a quick question, depending on how caught up the person is; however, if they haven't caught up or have not done any analysis in a while, answering a question of \"Who would you vote?\" could take upwards of 2-3 hours, and that's a low estimate for a thread as big as this one. In contrast, answering your accusations would have taken mere minutes, as it doesn't require nearly as much thought.<br>\n<br>\nYou keep saying time and again that it should not take that long to read a game and acquire reads, even after Rainbowdash has confirmed that she once took about 6 hours in a game.

We're still OK and for once I actually got things right.<br>\n<br>\nSo let me explain my thought process for a second here: Originally I thought either I was going to be role blocked or NKed, and that I should just throw out a random track because it doesn't matter. However, as I thought about things, I realized that my track on Gooner during night 2 (that revealed him going nowhere) told me something interesting: scum has NO active power role. If there are only 2 scum, then in a standard setup a role blocker would not be able to send in the kill, and they'd BOTH be going somewhere!<br>\n<br>\nThen I also realized that if scum night killed me, it would confirm beyond a shadow of doubt that Gooner is scum, and he would be the lynch, so scum NEEDED me alive one more night. But they couldn't role block me. I initially thought to try and catch Gooner's partner in the track, thinking about who it could be. I realized the likelihood of Equinox being Gooner's buddy is just about nothing (as Equinox was tracked nowhere on night 1 and Gooner was tracked nowhere on night 2), and there is almost assuredly the other scum buddy (looks like it has to be either Rainbow or Hiraki) sending in the kills.<br>\n<br>\nHOWEVER, scum must have realized this too, and must have kept their still as of yet unknown scum buddy (which, as I've previously stated, is almost certainly Rainbow or Hiraki) safe, and had Gooner send in the kill.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">So I tracked Gooner. And he went RIGHT to Majiffy last night</div>.<br>\n<br>\nAfter an entire game of screwing up, I think I've finally figured things out. My guess for the scum team is obviously Gooner with Hiraki as the buddy. I'll obviously be night killed tonight so if I can I'll spend a little time today taking a look at Rainbow and Hiraki to see if I can offer any insight for the final lynch. Fortunately, you guys are going to be going in to the final day with Equinox as close to confirmed town as you can, so we've got at worst a 50/50 of taking this home.<br>\n<br>\nThis setup makes a lot more sense to me now, as 2 goons against a town this weak seems to make so much more sense than any of the possibilities with that crazy strong JOAT in it. Also, a 2 man scum team is the only instance where I've personally seen scum given daytalk, so it's certainly possible they've had that all along. I won't speculate too much on that, though.<br>\n<br>\nSo obviously <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote Gooner</div>, but I ask that we don't speedlynch this guy, just so I can do my due process to insure I'm not stupidly asking you guys to lynch Hiraki tomorrow.", "time": "Sat Jun 16, 2012 6:05 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=21622&start=1350", "forum": "53", "thread": "21622"}

Look at how ICE had his vote on a townie for an extremely long time yesterday. A vote on a townie gained no immediate traction and we know that the final vote was by a townie. In other words, ICE saw that Hiraki was the most likely lynch yesterday and stepped in to save him by shifting the attention to DCL instantly.

In the scenario where Gooner is scum, the optimal play would be to let ICEninja track, turning the following Day into a \"he said, she said\" standoff on the logic that scum should not be letting trackers getting guilty results so close to home base. It's the same for the scenario where ICEninja is scum; Gooner wasn't going to shoot, so letting Gooner have a go would lead to the same result above had Gooner performed a confirmable action. The situation is slightly stickier for scum if it's both Gooner and ICEninja, but I can still see this working as a gambit.<br>\n<br>\nThat said, I'm not sure how much I buy a Gooner-ICEninja team if I'm looking at this from the standpoint of just setup, as that means we have 1 doctor versus 2 goons or, at the most, one very low-powered scum role and a goon. This is nearly vanilla. While it might be balanced, somehow I don't think that's what chauchaudotcom have gone for. Her last game was also low on power relative to most other Mini Normals but not to this extent. Nevertheless, I can't rule it out, so I'll look into their interactions a little later.<br>\n<br>\nArguing over whose setup between Gooner's and ICEninja's proposals makes more sense is starting to feel like a fool's errand because both the doctor + tracker proposal and the doctor + strong jack-of-all-trades proposal can be balanced with varying degrees of elegance. Heck, even the lone star doctor proposal above can be balanced and make for a nice troll. Okay, yeah, let's pretend this didn't happen.<br>\n<br>\nSo the LyLo where the cross voters have cases on each other that are both loaded with confirmation bias is the best kind of LyLo. Or at least that's what Gooner's initial case was like.<br>\n<br>\nHmm. Looking again at what Rainbowdash had on Hiraki, that rules out Hiraki as scum, as that's not something scum would even think of faking.

After we got the doc flip (and we killed soras because of <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4072382#p4072382\" class=\"postlink\">this post</a>) I figured town wouldn't buy having a doctor, a JK, and a JOAT with both doctor and role blocker.<br>\n<br>\nUpon retrospect, I think it would have been better to just damn well let Gooner shoot FG, and let town think they were in a mylo situation and push the no lynch, it would have been safer. However, the situation allowed me to fake claim so believably that it worked out like gold that we took Gooner to lylo.<br>\n<br>\nI gotta admit though, Rainbow you made me nervous as hell. I did NOT want to take you to lylo, but we were forced to because Majiffy saw right through everything I said, and you decided towards the end of day 4 that I was telling the truth and that Gooner probably wasn't.<br>\n<br>\nEquinox replaced in to a pretty damn scummy slot, and lurked probably the 100% optimal amount. She made just enough quality posts to keep off people's lurker hunting radars, but definitely didn't say enough to contribute to the game. I actually want to personally thank Equinox for joining this game. I know how busy you were for a while there, and that your lurking actually had nothing to do with being scum, and you pretty much joined this game as a favor to me, so I really just wanted to express that I appreciated it. If a lameo got replaced in to your slot and got lynched early on I would have been so screwed to do that all by myself.", "time": "Thu Jun 21, 2012 7:09 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=21622&start=1425", "forum": "53", "thread": "21622"}
