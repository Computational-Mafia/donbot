You're making a lot of inaccurate assumptions here about my level of hubris. That bandwagon during RVS was getting big, but short of a grossly incompetent townie, an accidental hammer was very unlikely. Scum hammering and pretending to be inept town seems like it would have been a far more likely scenario to me. And neither side hammering seems like an even more likely scenario. If we accept that the lynch was extremely unlikely to occur and that scum would be most likely to hammer, then an early lynch would arguably have been more favorable for the town.<br><br>On the other hand, scum can get towncred for pretending to be scared of a lynch that early on. And, if Gamma truly is Yoshi's partner, Yoshi'd have every reason to be nervous, on the off-chance that an incompetent townie accidentally (or purposely, honestly) hammered there.<br><br>tl;dr: Irrespective of Gamma's alignment, Yoshi as town had more to gain from Gamma's death than he had to lose, while Yoshi as scum had more to gain from ending the wagon there.<br><br>There are, however, two holes in my thinking that I am aware of.<br><br>1. It's possible that Yoshi wouldn't have thought any of the things that I just thought, regardless of his alignment.<br>2. I've basically set up a scenario that regardless of how Gamma flips if we lynch him, Yoshi looks scummier to me. <br><br>I realize the potential role confirmation bias may play in how I interpret Yoshi's actions from here on, but I don't plan to push forward with only this reasoning. I assume that as the game progresses, my scum read may be strengthened or it may be weakened. But at our current stage in the game, these are the best leads I've got (and I don't think they are bad), so I'm pursuing them until I have reason to believe I shouldn't.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9172170#p9172170\" class=\"postlink\">post 140</a>, ChannelDelibird wrote:</cite>Hey, people.

Even within canon, many different Pok\u00e9mon has had many different pronunciations of the same Pok\u00e9mon. Most of the time, you'd go with any one so long others recognise it.

I've always had a tough time being brief, but I've been told in the past that long posts are anti-town because some people won't bother reading them and/or they feel like it's just a method of trying to appear active. I'll try to keep things as short as possible in the future, but I personally prefer to be thorough so that I am not misunderstood. Might just tl;dr at the end of all of my large posts from now on."}

I've got to read, reread, fact-check, contemplate, and solidify my thoughts. Then I have to carefully select my words in order to remove as much ambiguity from my posts as possible, that way it can be clear to everyone exactly what I'm saying. And don't even get me started on the time I spend on BBCode to try to make things as intelligible as possible. Incidentally, that's why I made the comment regarding my messed up quote. Like I said, I'm pretty code with it. What I forgot about this site is that every now and then, when you click the quote button, the quote just appears messed up. I only even realized it because it happened to me again earlier. I'm pretty sure that's a bug that's been around since 2011 and I'm honestly kind of surprised it still exists.<br><br>My point is, even if you question my motives, I like to think that there is very little room for interpretation regarding the content of my words.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9172915#p9172915\" class=\"postlink\">post 155</a>, Transcend wrote:</cite>As for the Mario read i thought his vote was towny but then read his iso and didn't like some of the posts</div></blockquote><br>Could you please elaborate on this?</div></div></div><br><br><div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: MortFeld</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display: none;\"><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9172840#p9172840\" class=\"postlink\">post 152</a>, MortFeld wrote:</cite>Not any strong reason.

Town have extremely legitimate reasons to worry about looking suspicious. People can and are misinterpreted and mislynched. I can't speak for anyone else, but being mislynched or mistrusted is one of the most frustrating things in this game for me, especially in LyLo. It's possible to interpret that a line of questioning is being asked solely for the purpose of setting you up as a fall guy. This is compounded by the fact that townies are 100% certain that they are innocent and they sometimes overestimate how apparent that should be to everybody else.<br><br>That said, I generally agree with you and I don't think town should live in fear of that. Especially when it comes to vanilla townies. Not that I'm interpreting Yoshi as either a VT or a power role, I'm just saying in terms of game theory, VTs are expendable as hell and should be willing to jump on a grenade for most power roles. Mislynches can and will happen, there's no avoiding it. If it happens to you, it sucks, but oh well. So I think it's better to be loud and proud about your opinions if you are a member of the town and if you die, have some amount of faith that your team will find a way to turn your death into an advantage. Not everybody has that level of dedication to their team though. Some are just here to play a fun game. And there's nothing wrong with that; it's just not as helpful.</div></div></div><br><br><div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: Ircher</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display: none;\"><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9174462#p9174462\" class=\"postlink\">post 208</a>, Ircher wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9171962#p9171962\" class=\"postlink\">post 128</a>, Hikari Link wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9171909#p9171909\" class=\"postlink\">post 109</a>, MortFeld wrote:</cite>Yoshi <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9171018#p9171018\">45</a> town</div></blockquote><br>Why does this make Yoshi town in any way?<br><br>Your points about him are valid, MortFeld.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Gamma Emerald</span><br><br>I'm not letting Yoshi off the hook there, because I still feel like his response to the speedwagon was more likely to come from scum than town.

Like you're basically treating him as conftown which, if he's scum, and him being scum is theoretically possible, radically changes how he has to interact with you. It makes more sense for someone to have this viewpoint if they're scum. Earning potential town cred from TF (though knowing him this is unlikely) and it would be a very easy way to justify having the knowledge that TF is town, which is what I was getting at."}

MortFeld's posting feels good to me? You're probably a better player but it seems to come from a town POV. Hikari feels like he wants to push the game forward and ask questions (although I would like to see what he does with them later.) Ircher just generally feels town from his tone; it feels both town and similar to past games that I have played with him.<br>I'm assuming by the second 2face you meant transcend."}

That's how I'm seeing it, is there anything you disagree with here?"}

I see the concern with Titus flipping her transcend read, but she replaced before addressing it and there are enough posts in-between that I'm not scumreading her for it. <br><br>L1 makes a difference because it gives scum the hammer in a situation where I don't think it's necessary yet, when we still have things to gain by letting replacements and CDB catch up. With the current mood, I don't think they'd get a lot of pushback for it.<br><br>I think titus left because she didn't like how transcend was playing towards her and was upset that we didn't lynch him for it."}

You were voting kop for a single incident that happened Day 1. EARLY day 1 at that (your issue with him was voting without reading everything first). You came in day 3 AFTER a scum lynch and dropped a vote without reading (see the issue I had with your vote? See the similarities between you and kop?) you had no legit reasons for your scum read on kop. So yay you found scum based purely on luck. <br>3. You ONLY voted the one of the scum because he was the alternative to you. This other scum just so happened to be the person you were hard town reading almost the entire game and refused to explain to anyone why. You did a 180 out of the blue. Your other vote of scum was purely omgus and people were town reading that slot. <br><br>You refused to answer direct questions, your pushes lacked any reasoning, your more serious votes only came after you were under pressure of being lynched, and you basically did nothing to help town. Multiple people thought your play was terrible. I'd say hand down it's the worst performance I've ever seen from anyone.<br><br>4. If you were truly looking for a friendly game of mafia there is zero chance you would pick this game. A friendly game of mafia doesn't consist of joining a game you almost always have a fight with. Unless you enjoy fighting with me which means you've proved my point of having bad motives. No sane person imo would play a game with somebody they don't get along with."}

And yes, I do tend to assume that I am obviously in the right a lot of the time even if it's not really obvious and sometimes even if I'm not right. Perhaps all my viewpoints on the matter of subbing out come from the fact that I have a somewhat petty dislike for giving up until having actually tried everything I could.</div></blockquote><br>Again, you're misunderstanding me and your feelings on giving up aren't relevant here, because what I said has nothing to do with giving up. <br><br>I'm saying that different people have different ideas of when they are caught.

So you can't (or at least, shouldn't) apply your definition of caught to them when you don't know when they feel like they are caught.<br><br>On top of that, I'm saying that both Titus and Transcend could've considered themselves caught scum, yet still replaced out because they didn't like the attitudes of players in the game. I'm not trying to argue with you here, I'm just pointing out that there can be differences in communication and perspective that can be barriers to understanding somebody's motivations.</div></div></div></div></blockquote>Sorry your posts are very tl;dr-y and I try to read the full posts regardless of whether they address me to gain full understanding of your viewpoints and when it does address me, like just now, I lose sight of what we're actually arguing about. Or in this case talking since, according to you, you're not arguing (which I now only have a vague recollection of - exams are stressful).<br>If you'd like me to say anything else about this reiterate please and I'll have a look at it again.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9192728#p9192728\" class=\"postlink\">post 821</a>, Tarkus wrote:</cite>As I see it we're bogged down in two slots that are now empty, and I have a strong feeling that scum's pretty content with the game state.

No.  It was a minor observation.<br><br>If I had made the same observation but said \"I'm town reading Mort...mostly for his early play, but he seems to have tailed off a bit on his activity.

The fact you yourself feel the need to change your play...and even you admit you are an asshole when you play mafia shows you are aware of your MASSIVE personality/teamwork flaws.  Every game I have seen you in you get into nasty exchanges with people (not just me) that more often than not just lead to people replacing out or mislynches thanks to you.  I suspect that the reason you do not want to share your previous main's identity...that you claim experience playing with me as...is because it was probably banned for assholery and you are playing as TwoFace to skirt the ban.  Maybe a TwoFace ban is somewhere close in the future.  One can dream <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\"><br><br>In this game alone you have had major issues with four players and you have been admonished or criticized by at least four others!  That's EIGHT players that have had exchanges with you based on your behavior and not the game.  Maybe more that I just overlooked.  And that eight is not counting the mod who has had to try and reel in gameplay (to little avail).<br><br>Our last game (<span class=\"noboldsig\">which you signed up for after I did you hypocrite</span>) you weren't quite as bad as you have been in this \"new improved\" version of you.  And after I was mislynched in large part due to you you still flaked out of that game for in part...player incompatibilities.  Scum even thanked you after the game for being such a valuable member of their team...and you were town!  lol....<br><br>Another example was recent completed game I chose not to replace into because you, DSOC, were having a \"toxic\" exchange with another player (MOI) that resulted in you getting kicked out of the game.  It goes on and on...smh....<br><br>I'm not really sure why you even play this game.  You are obviously socially challenged.  All you do is complain about other people in your games....you whine like a little ____ to mods and site admins for the slightest offense and you act like a total child.  I envision you falling on the floor next to your computer and throwing a tantrum when something pisses you off.  It's absurd.<br><br>And yet you're hilarious at the same time.  The points you make are assinine at best and usually misguided.  Your reads are terrible and yet you have never done anything wrong in the game of Mafia.  Anyone you have ever been wrong about when you are town is at fault.  It's their fault they got mislynched...they didn't act town.  They were scummy.  Not your bad.<br><br>Bullshit!  lol.....<br><br>And to say you hate someone on this website who is just trying to play a game is psychotic.  Someone who your primary objections to are related to post formatting!? It's just a game that you are bad at and make other people miserable in...except scum.  If you are seeing a therapist I would recommend you ask them to up your meds.  If you aren't....you should consider seeing one immediately.  I would be very afraid to be in any post offices in your neighborhood.<br><br>I will not avoid playing in games you are in if I'm interested in the player list.  If that makes you miserable....that's your problem.

I've just been pretty busy and catching up here has been difficult. Mostly just been skimming recently.<br><br>Looking at the Wiki, it seems like the Watcher is generally considered a pretty cheap role as town, but a pretty acceptable role as scum, so I suppose maybe their is something to TwoFace's concerns regarding a fake claim. Of course, he also said that a Mafia Double Voter is pretty uncommon. It could be completely possible that the mod has gone with a setup that's balanced, but full of relatively unused roles. So if TwoFace ever flips scum or havingfitz flips town, we may want to start looking at the other.<br><br>For now, I say we let fitz live and see if he can bring us actionable information. Honestly, I kinda just want this day to end so we can get a flip and stop poking around in the dark.

His reads look fine imo and show a town thought process.

So, w/ RVS et cetera, there isn't going to be a lot to analyze so questions won't have a lot of depth. While the # of Qs Mort asked was kinda high, I don't necessarily see it as scum-motivated.</span><br><br>3. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9173590#p9173590\">177</a> --&gt; Admits reasoning was bad cuz trying to get things going --&gt; <span style=\"font-style: italic\">And this feels like Titus is distancing from her read. Had she said this way earlier, I might buy it, but this seems to be Titus thinking \"Oops! I better try to play that read off as non-serious\". I don't buy it at all.</span><br><br>4. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9173594#p9173594\">178</a> --&gt; Mort/Yoshi pinged her as partners --&gt; <span style=\"font-style: italic\">This early in the game? I mean, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9171615#p9171615\">68</a> kinda pinged me as Titus / MMM being possible partners, but by no means did I see a solid association between the two. Unless Titus elaborates later, this association read feels superficial and an attempt to appear to have reads while simultaneously casting shade at another player.</span><br><br>5. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9173720#p9173720\">182</a> --&gt; Transcend is weak town --&gt; <span style=\"font-style: italic\">I would like to note that this happened after Transcend said that town!Titus pretty much always defends him at this point in the game. Titus is obviously trying to keep her options open.</span><br><br>6. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9179147#p9179147\">387</a> --&gt; Asks how Tarkus can see things as her on Mort despite not understanding Titus's posts --&gt; <span style=\"font-style: italic\">Different perspective perhaps? Feels like another shade-throwing attempt. Not to mention that Titus hasn't been too specific in her read, so it's pretty difficult to understand when one quotes zero evidence.</span><br><br>7. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9179232#p9179232\">408</a> --&gt; Says town!Trans actually pressures people --&gt; <span style=\"font-style: italic\">What suggests he isn't? Also, I honestly don't see the difference between Transcend here and Transcend in 1900. Again, I think this is scum Titus keeping her options open.</span><br><br>So that is my not meta-based case on Titus.</div></blockquote><br><br>This post is scummy IMO</div></blockquote><br>How?"}

As I read through it seemed like the same town TwoFace I've played with and ID'd correctly numerous times before.  The DV solidifies a town read here.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Hikari Link - </span>I just read him as town.  I read his posts (game related...not biographical or theory related) and it's like he was reading my mind att when he <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9171880#p9171880\">voted BYF</a>.  It looks like he is trying to solve the game and think things out.  I liked what I saw from him in my last game (I died coughcough before he replaced in) and he was town.  This feels the same.  If he is scum I would be very impressed.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">RayFrost - </span>Nothing to do with NTRPaul or RayFrost.  This is all -Grey-.  I thought he replaced in and made genuine efforts to make progress and was very like-minded to what I was thinking.  He posted a shitload in a short amount of time and didn't care if he pissed anyone off as long as he was<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Tarkus - </span>he was a non entity until page 15 and then he kicked things into gear.  Clear and concise and not hiding what he's thinking which will help keep him accountable/read him as the game goes on.  He could have stayed quiet with my wagon and let its momentum carry on but he voiced objection to it and tried to reign in the game.  I know scum could do that for towncred but Tarkus feels town.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">MortFeld - </span>I haven't really had a problem with any of Mort posts.  I liked his early game efforts to get the game moving.  The only real negative (aside from the activity thing I mentioned later which I'm not really that hung up on) is that some of the pushes he made on Gamma seemed unfounded IMO.  Ex. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9175299#p9175299\">246</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9175299#p9175299\"> 246</a>.  I'm undecided atm on Gamma and I still like Mort as town but I feel these two pushes are misguided.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">MarioManiac - </span>Didn't really notice him much on my catch up...not a good thing...until <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9190129#p9190129\">Post 770</a>.  Very similar to my thoughts on people.  Like minded to me is good.  Not sure why he was reading TwoFace as null at one point in the game but he's stepped up his participation after a slow start.  Engaged and likeminded = tr for me.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">ChannelDelibird - </span>nada.  Was looking forward to playing with CDB but I suspect this will be a replace out. (Same with the RayFrost slot)<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">MMM - </span>Even though he has posted a lot he is kind of nul.  I'm having a hard time finding a preponderance of good or bad stuff to push me one way or the other.  I know people have called him out for a few things but he seems to explain himself out of situatiojns.  Because he's town and there was no issue to begin with or because he's scum and can form decent explanations?  IDK.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Gamma Emerald - </span>I didn't like him giving out early TR's on Mort and BYF (post 33?).  Other than that...I know as I was going through my catch up I was feeling suspicion towards Gamma but in hindsight I don't think it was for anything he had done himself than as much as it was a residual feeling from all the suspicion (votes anyway) from others.  Kind of a where there's smoke there's fire thing.  I don't like his wanting to string me up to potentially make use of a tell which is questionable to begin with...would require that I actually flip scum...and would have required that I'd actually provided some content to work from.  And as I had not provided any reads up to this point and as I am not scum...this was a pretty bad plan...smh.  This \"bad plan\" is probably the main thing I dislike about the slot but I don't want subliminal omgus to cloud my view.  Probably my weakest suspect.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Ircher - </span>It took 22 posts before I saw one with what I would consider any real game related effort and that was a vote on my slot for what appears to be meta reasons associated with 2 players (Titus and Transcend).  So meta squared.  Ugh.  That seems worse than pre-flip associations.  Then when people point out Titus read is based on meta, he produces a completely different set of reasons for suspecting Titus.  All, but pt #5, which were not mentioned when he voted Titus.  So looking for reasons after the fact to help justify read.  Also not sure what his issue is with my role.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">BigYoshiFan - </span> Didn't care for <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9175768#p9175768\">Post 276</a> when I first read it and in hindsight...still don't.  Not sure how the reasons given warrant a tr.  Same with giving Transcend a tr for replacing out and what I perceived as buttering up to a generally concensus regarded TR (Hiraki).  Stayed on TwoFace quite some time after double voter was confirmed without ever really giving a reason for the 2F vote in the first place...or even mentioning any consideration of the DV.  Then BYF decides transcend is town but maintains a vote on him for 30+ posts.  Only a little over an hour realtime though.  It bugged me more when I first saw it but I'm not sure I see any motivation in it...it's just struck me as odd.  FMPOV...if I'm town and I suspect someone I'm going to vote them because my vote is all I have and I'm judicious with it.  If I decide a scum read is suddenly town...my vote is coming off in the same post.  Or the next one.  I.e. I don't vote or maintain votes on townreads.  It just bugs me that BYF did.  Like his vote being on a tr didn't really matter.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Whemestar - </span>I always think Transcend is scum.  Not intentionally.  And I'm not sure if I have seen his scum game or not to know if there's a difference.  I didn't care for a lot of the reads he threw out.  It felt like he was just throwing them out there to see if any gained traction.  His <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9171938#p9171938\">overreaction</a> to an MMM scum listing seemed too over the top....fake.  And his exit/not exit/exit was just too WIFOMy for me to give any kind of relief for.  And Whemestar hasn't done anything of note since joining either.<br><br><br>So these are my reads as they currently stand.  I think the only people I would actively support being lynched today would be Wheme, BYF and Ircher.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Whemestar</span>"}

But in reality, it's probably got more to do with the fact that about half the players are inactive, most that aren't think Wheme is scummy, and scum gain from either bussing or mislynching him, so there's little incentive for a counterwagon to start. And if you want to get really technical, Ircher and Gamma are decent counterwagons, given are lack of activity in this game right now. You should come join the Wheme wagon though."}

His reads look fine imo and show a town thought process. It seems more like Titus is simpl trying to find something she can attack herself -- how ironic!</span><br><br>2. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9173560#p9173560\">171</a> --&gt; Elaborates on Mort read; mainly states that Mort's stuff lacks depth and asks too many questions --&gt; <span style=\"font-style: italic\">Honestly, I still feel like Titus is trying to find things to attack; Titus made the original read about 1 1/2 pages into the game. So, w/ RVS et cetera, there isn't going to be a lot to analyze so questions won't have a lot of depth. While the # of Qs Mort asked was kinda high, I don't necessarily see it as scum-motivated.</span><br><br>3. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9173590#p9173590\">177</a> --&gt; Admits reasoning was bad cuz trying to get things going --&gt; <span style=\"font-style: italic\">And this feels like Titus is distancing from her read. Had she said this way earlier, I might buy it, but this seems to be Titus thinking \"Oops! I better try to play that read off as non-serious\". I don't buy it at all.</span><br><br>4. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9173594#p9173594\">178</a> --&gt; Mort/Yoshi pinged her as partners --&gt; <span style=\"font-style: italic\">This early in the game? I mean, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9171615#p9171615\">68</a> kinda pinged me as Titus / MMM being possible partners, but by no means did I see a solid association between the two. Unless Titus elaborates later, this association read feels superficial and an attempt to appear to have reads while simultaneously casting shade at another player.</span><br><br>5. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9173720#p9173720\">182</a> --&gt; Transcend is weak town --&gt; <span style=\"font-style: italic\">I would like to note that this happened after Transcend said that town!Titus pretty much always defends him at this point in the game. Titus is obviously trying to keep her options open.</span><br><br>6. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9179147#p9179147\">387</a> --&gt; Asks how Tarkus can see things as her on Mort despite not understanding Titus's posts --&gt; <span style=\"font-style: italic\">Different perspective perhaps? Feels like another shade-throwing attempt. Not to mention that Titus hasn't been too specific in her read, so it's pretty difficult to understand when one quotes zero evidence.</span><br><br>7. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9179232#p9179232\">408</a> --&gt; Says town!Trans actually pressures people --&gt; <span style=\"font-style: italic\">What suggests he isn't? Also, I honestly don't see the difference between Transcend here and Transcend in 1900.

I just want this Day to be over so we can stop faffing about in the dark and start playing some real Mafia. <br><br>I don't care about a Day 1 mislynch; it's almost inevitable for town to do so Day 1 and we can't lynch the guy who I think has the highest chance of being scum right now (fitz), so that makes it even more unlikely. We got a lot of discussion out of today (too much more and it'll be harder to reanalyze as we go forward), so I just want to end the day and get the game started."}

They can easily hide behind the other options and just say that they think the scum target is town or that they have stronger scumreads. But there should only 3 in a setup of this size, so it's not like they have absolute control over the vote. On top of that, there's plenty of motivation for scum to bus here. I can't speak for anybody else, but I have no problem bussing for towncred Day 1 (or any other day, for that matter). So to say that the leading wagons have virtually no chance of being scum strikes me as a bit narrow-minded.<br><br>I'm not saying I want us to mislynch here; quite the opposite. I'm just saying it's just not that likely that we're going to catch scum right now, with our lack of information. And since it's not that likely, I'm not going to be heartbroken if it's a mislynch. You say that scum are happily sitting about and letting this happen? Prove it. Let the mislynch happen and then start analyzing who pushed those lynches, rather than the alternative. Because it's the people with strong feelings right now that are the most worrisome to me. <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">It's not like you have to worry about dying tonight, MortFeld. You and I are the obvious Doctor bait right now. Scum would be fools to target us. And a Doctor would be a fool to target anyone but us. And that includes TwoFace. He even said himself that he probably needs to die at some point. Yes, this is a blatant statement to both a Doctor and the Mafia. What are you gonna do about it?</span>"}

So, w/ RVS et cetera, there isn't going to be a lot to analyze so questions won't have a lot of depth.

Feels like another shade-throwing attempt.

Basically there is a very large group of people in a town pool and the lynch pool is those who are not in the town pool.<br><br>But the latter group is pretty arbitrary if that is the criterion.

You randomly asked me if I'm mafia and quoted that post. What about my assumption does not make sense? If you scumread me for different reasons, why would you quote that post in particular? And this site has a general meta of scumreading people who present viewpoints that are contrary to what you believe even if it isn't alignment-indicative.<br><br>2) I townread you and Gamma for early game reasons. I already expressed the reason as to why I would prefer not lynching Wheme. You may have a point about MMM, but I remember having a weak soft townread on them. And, I'm pretty sure RayFrost didn't replace Grey, and I have yet to see anything from Frost that makes me lean town there.<br><br>3) Again, I disagree with both a Gamma and a Wheme lynch rn and townread the majority of the active players. Why should I switch to a wagon that I do not agree with when there is still a decent amount of tme left in Day 1?"}

This is a sign of over-defensiveness and shows another form of reactionary gameplay. <br><br>We see in this post here another case of GE posting suspicions:<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9179868#p9179868\" class=\"postlink\">post 485</a>, Gamma Emerald wrote:</cite>Transcend and MMM for now<br>Ircher isn't an SR anymore</div></blockquote><br><br>But there's no mention of MMM before this, and, if you look at the following posts, there is <span style=\"font-style: italic\">no</span> followup - no real scumhunting toward MMM to solidify this read or even show why this read exists.<br><br>I thought I'd keep going but honestly they're more of the same.<br><br>If you go through GE's postings, the votes are rarely outside of what other people are voting, his \"reads\" are either reasonless or could've been super easily copypasted from someone else. Without being questioned or pushed for reasons, GE has not actually given any this entire game. There are more contentless posts than contentful posts, with less content given the less talk about or to him there is.<br><br>The willingness to lynch anyone who isn't a townread is inherently a more pro-scum mindset as anyone that <span style=\"font-style: italic\">isn't</span> scum is a good death. You might also note that GE said he was <span style=\"font-style: italic\">townreading the fitz slot</span> but then <span style=\"font-style: italic\">kept his vote and requested a claim</span>. The only motivation to do this is to reveal Fitz's role while it's a free option. If you're town, you push against lynching a townread and try to not get the townread to reveal their role. You don't force them to claim then jump off when you were already townreading the person.<br><br>Nothing GE has done this game has been actual scumhunting.

If you aren't confirmed town and we make it to LyLo together, I'll probably be even more suspicious of you.

It's almost like having two layers of protection. Of course, saying this now, scum may be more inclined to strike pro-town players. Which may make protective people more likely to protect them.

A town flip is still better than two living townies, because it gives us data to work with. You've given us relatively little to work with and my expectations aren't high. Sorry, but I've literally seen you as conftown sit around and do nothing to help find the last scum. And while you're alive, you hinder our ability to utilize the Double Voter for better wagons. Mislynching you if you're town certainly isn't ideal, but it's not the worst thing that can happen or even a particularly bad thing."}

We have to consider the circumstances around the lynch, we have to consider who supported the lynch, we have to consider who opposed the lynch, and we have to consider the types of interactions you had. The point is, we'd have hard data. Dead, you're confirmed town or scum. Alive, you're a constant question mark."}

Mort and Gamma clearly don't want to lynch you. You're not Ray's first choice. Tarkus didn't scumread you, I don't think. Mario is only voting you because Ircher is a tougher lynch.

We'd need to get him to L-1 and then he'd need to claim. And if his claim was a PR, we'd just have to all quickly switch back to Wheme (which, if he's scum, he'd definitely do at this point). So he's ultimately not going to end up lynched and if he's town, only scum stand to benefit. Personally, I think the Ircher wagon is much more likely to be scum-driven than the Wheme wagon."}

But then Yoshi stole my post, so I had to pivot to something else. I decided to breadcrumb with the first letter of the first word of the first sentence of my first post, the second word of the second sentence of my second post, and the third word of the third sentence of my third post. Technically, Vote was the first letter of my first sentence, but I decided to just run with it, since it was close enough and sufficiently subtle that I wouldn't be caught.<br><br>I anticipated that I might have to reveal my breadcrumb at several stages in the game, so I didn't leave any clues other clues in my first post, but I always had plans for my second and third post. The initial claim was supposed to be Full Cop Day 2, that way I could draw protective roles to me and get a potential roleblock on me Night 2 (when I couldn't do anything anyway). <br><br>Day 3 I was supposed to point to my second post and say that I was breadcrumbing that I was a One-Shot Cop, that way scum wouldn't bother to Roleblock me Night 3. I was still going to argue for protection though, with the assertion that my claim makes me essentially confirmed town and so I'd be valuable to keep around.<br><br>Day 4, I was supposed to reveal my results and let everybody know I had been an Odd-Night Cop the whole time. My third post was meant to be the final hint, which is why I specifically said \"every other,\" to indicate that I could use my effect every other night. But then the Roleblocker got lynched and the necessity of that plan went out the window. And since I'm replacing out anyway, I thought it would be better to reveal my breadcrumb now, that way people could see why this isn't just a fakeclaim, but a plan that has been in the making since the beginning.<br><br>Also, one of the reasons I was trying to rush through Day 1 was because I just wanted to Cop fitz already, since I felt really good about him as scum."}

It's pretty fence-sitty. But at the same time, he doesn't have a huge amount to go off of. Our Day 1 lynch wasn't ideal (we can probably try to glean some info, if we analyze it, but we could use more). The Night 1 death was on a pretty town player, so there isn't much room for speculation there. Day 2 pretty much didn't exist and there's not anything to glean off of people sheeping a Cop claim. Night 2 was again a pretty clear town player, so there's still not anything to speculate on.

Gamma is one of the most scumread people in the game right now and your other three in the next tier have generally seen similar levels of heat as each other. So you've basically got a read list that allows you to pivot to any of the prime lynch candidates, at least half of which mathematically must be mislynches. If intentional, it's pretty much textbook opportunism. It also means that if you're scum, I'd probably be expecting PenguinPower as your partner."}

I feel that he is not really sure how to respond to Transcend calling him scum so early, and his continued interaction with him over the next two pages feels very much like an awkward attempt to seem to have been scumhunting - he comments only in an abstract way and none of it feels real."}

If I remember correctly I put you a scumlean because your scumhunting felt a little weak, you've felt a little coast-y at times, and I thought your push on Titus was kind of one-dimensional, and the way that you responded to the guilty by quoting Kelvin's post with a vote felt a little self-conscious.

If Titus didn't get along with her buds in the pregame chat and was unhappy with how they were playing, I could see that as spurring her to replace out.<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9237992#p9237992\" class=\"postlink\">post 2041</a>, Kelvin Smith wrote:</cite>2. Why is Ircher your prime suspect?</div></blockquote>Ircher is my prime suspect for the busser because of the sudden way that he came out with a Titus case once Transcend started saying that Titus was scum. I felt that his attack lacked nuance, that he didn't really follow it up and that he didn't treat the claim with the kind of skepticism I would expect of someone who is very strongly convinced that someone is scum the way that Ircher seemed to be. From what I remember, he only stated blandly that a watcher was entirely possible as a scum role. He didn't engage with the claim really at all, and aside from that he didn't engage with Titus or fitz and develop his push in a villagery way."}

And I never really had a scumread on him. His reaction to my accusations on day 1 was quite towny (which brought him from null to town), and the reactions of other players around those accusations were more suspect. My main motivation for pushing him was that I had felt it was highly unlikely a wagon would actually shift to him (I didn't want more claims, really) and it was highly likely people would be willing to discuss it (other pushes felt less likely to get any substance from the others). Sorry to Gamma. You were a good choice for this. Nothing personal.<br><br>Now, the reactions of two players in particular bothered me: Ircher and BigYoshiFan. I'm fine with voting either one this game phase. I'd need to go back through to link to specific posts for BigYoshiFan, but here's the basic breakdown for both reads:<br><br>BigYoshiFan - his ~scumread~ on titus and his reactions around her were very much of the omgus variety in that it could be boiled down to \"titus' reasoning for suspecting me is bad so titus is suspect\" - his suspicion of titus is artificial at best and is a reaction, not individually spawned. This can be seen by his reaction to people townreading the titus slot as well. <br><br>A lot of BigYoshiFan's sources of suspicion can be summed up with \"what this person did didn't feel genuine\" - there's no way to really poke at this reasoning. And it's not wrong in and of itself. But when it's the reason for most of your reads, it becomes an excuse rather than a reason. He also puts mild efforts to express a townread of Ircher in reaction to people suspecting him. Mind you, associative tells before a flip aren't the best to go off of, but it's a point for why ircher's number two.<br><br>Additionally, his reaction to my case against Gamma was \"<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9213934#p9213934\" class=\"postlink\">I promise more later, but it's intriguing</a>\" with nothing given later. Intriguing and interesting are two words with very similar uses: you say them and it can mean anything you want. Also note BigYoshiFan never shows any suspicion of Gamma prior to or after that post.<br><br>Ircher - Associative tells with BigYoshiFan are the main reason, to be honest. If you look through their interactions and the flow of their reads, there's a lot of them matching up in reads / supporting each other's cases and not a lot of actual direct interaction between them. It's indirect. Agreement, with little conflict of reads (or apparently not enough to converse with each other about their differences for some reason).<br><br>The stuff from today that has been mentioned could be included as well, but that's been covered.<br><br>I'd also like to make a premature claim because I can. I'm a <span class=\"noboldsig\">two shot gunsmith</span>, and I've used both shots on players that I couldn't get a good read on. One is MarioManiac4, the other is Penguin Power. Neither of them have guns. I'm making this claim now because the playerlist is small enough that having these results (especially since I can't get any more) out is beneficial given we don't know how many members of the scumteam there are. If you are a role with limited shots that is investigative and you've used them, I would suggest claiming now."}

And I never really had a scumread on him. His reaction to my accusations on day 1 was quite towny (which brought him from null to town), and the reactions of other players around those accusations were more suspect. My main motivation for pushing him was that I had felt it was highly unlikely a wagon would actually shift to him (I didn't want more claims, really) and it was highly likely people would be willing to discuss it (other pushes felt less likely to get any substance from the others). Sorry to Gamma. You were a good choice for this. Nothing personal.<br><br>Now, the reactions of two players in particular bothered me: Ircher and BigYoshiFan. I'm fine with voting either one this game phase. I'd need to go back through to link to specific posts for BigYoshiFan, but here's the basic breakdown for both reads:<br><br>BigYoshiFan - his ~scumread~ on titus and his reactions around her were very much of the omgus variety in that it could be boiled down to \"titus' reasoning for suspecting me is bad so titus is suspect\" - his suspicion of titus is artificial at best and is a reaction, not individually spawned. This can be seen by his reaction to people townreading the titus slot as well. <br><br>A lot of BigYoshiFan's sources of suspicion can be summed up with \"what this person did didn't feel genuine\" - there's no way to really poke at this reasoning. And it's not wrong in and of itself. But when it's the reason for most of your reads, it becomes an excuse rather than a reason. He also puts mild efforts to express a townread of Ircher in reaction to people suspecting him. Mind you, associative tells before a flip aren't the best to go off of, but it's a point for why ircher's number two.<br><br>Additionally, his reaction to my case against Gamma was \"<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9213934#p9213934\" class=\"postlink\">I promise more later, but it's intriguing</a>\" with nothing given later. Intriguing and interesting are two words with very similar uses: you say them and it can mean anything you want. Also note BigYoshiFan never shows any suspicion of Gamma prior to or after that post.<br><br>Ircher - Associative tells with BigYoshiFan are the main reason, to be honest. If you look through their interactions and the flow of their reads, there's a lot of them matching up in reads / supporting each other's cases and not a lot of actual direct interaction between them. It's indirect. Agreement, with little conflict of reads (or apparently not enough to converse with each other about their differences for some reason).<br><br>The stuff from today that has been mentioned could be included as well, but that's been covered.<br><br>I'd also like to make a premature claim because I can. I'm a <span class=\"noboldsig\">two shot gunsmith</span>, and I've used both shots on players that I couldn't get a good read on. One is MarioManiac4, the other is Penguin Power. Neither of them have guns. I'm making this claim now because the playerlist is small enough that having these results (especially since I can't get any more) out is beneficial given we don't know how many members of the scumteam there are. If you are a role with limited shots that is investigative and you've used them, I would suggest claiming now.</div></blockquote><br>Okay, so I'm considering those two (MM4 and PP) soft cleared for now<br>I forgot who the cop was :'(, can someone refresh me"}

I sure think you can. Your join date is quite recent, and the tone, especially when you say \"genuinely\" didn't rub me the right way.<br>2. The emphasis I was intending was not that it had attention to detail, but that it was regarding RVS, if that makes sense. Asserting reads largely based on RVS and the early game, as it seemed like that when I had comforted you on this, isn't very helpful. <br>3. What I mean by this is that you begin to incorporate the other parts of the game into your reads. <br>4. I am nitpicking. I'm just mentioning it because it is something that I didn't like and it specifically pertained to your read on me. I was expecting from this; however, a little more.... analysis? Like, maybe some of your thoughts on how I interpreted your read on me. Your response to this in particular seems quite defensive and I'm not sure I like it.<br>Also,<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9241898#p9241898\" class=\"postlink\">post 2157</a>, Priscila wrote:</cite>Tier list<br><br>Kelvin Smith, MarioManiac4<br>PenguinPower, MMM, BigYoshiFan<br>Ircher<br>Gamma Emerald, RayFrost</div></blockquote><br>Does this mean I'm just null then?"}

However, assuming that Ray's claim is true, I still think that Mafia Doctor would make sense since I feel like we would have way too much power otherwise considering we have two inspecting roles and a Jailkeeper on top of that.<br>Obviously that is false if your speculation that scum has a Rolecop is accurate - a Mafia Doctor on top of that would become too scumsided. However, how sure are you that there is a Mafia Rolecop? I feel like Roleblocker should do the job on its own there and Godfather/Doctor would make more sense here, in particular Doctor so that there are two roles messing with the Gunsmith's investigations - one giving a false negative, and one giving a false positive.<br>I'll have a look at the games you linked whenever I get round to posting things about Mario/Yoshi/Ray btw.<br><br>Pedit: Yoshi sniped me to part of this post"}

Again, it was gonna be a starting point for me to start sorting people had day not ended prematurely. Given that 1 of the people in that pool flipped scum, and 4/5 people in that pool are good lynch candidates atm, I think that is still a really good pool as well.

I'd want to call myself town as either alignment. Do think about it though - if he didn't have accurate reads, why would he be killed over Kelvin at the time? On Night 1, there would unlikely be any drawback to killing him, and basically everyone thought he was town, whereas 1-2 people expressed concerns over Mort (if I remember correctly, I might be wrong), and on top of that Kelvin was a PR and Mort wasn't, though I don't know how much scum knew about their roles at the time.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9248185#p9248185\" class=\"postlink\">post 2374</a>, MarioManiac4 wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9248178#p9248178\" class=\"postlink\">post 2373</a>, RayFrost wrote:</cite>Typically, gunsmith would not result in a \"has a gun\" for jailkeeper as far as I know.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Mod: By your definition of role interactions, if a gunsmith were to inspect a hypothetical jailkeeper, would it result in a result of having a gun or would it result in not having a gun?</span><br><br>As this is a purely hypothetical scenario that can't happen anyway given my two shots being up,</div></blockquote><br>\"In Normal games on mafiascum.net, a Gunsmith gets guilties on all Mafia (except Traitors and Doctors), Cops, Vigilantes, Gunsmiths, Role Cops, Vanilla Cops, Backups of roles with guns and JoATs that have any of these listed powers.\"<br>As this is a Normal game, you would not get a Gun result on a Jailkeeper- if this was the case your role would be greylisted and you would have been notified of this in your PM.

I usually don't actually know what answer I'm looking for - just that I want some sort of answer that I can elaborate on later. I'm not meticulous, and I really tend to do things as I go along, which I think this is a good example of.

And I never really had a scumread on him. His reaction to my accusations on day 1 was quite towny (which brought him from null to town), and the reactions of other players around those accusations were more suspect. My main motivation for pushing him was that I had felt it was highly unlikely a wagon would actually shift to him (I didn't want more claims, really) and it was highly likely people would be willing to discuss it (other pushes felt less likely to get any substance from the others). Sorry to Gamma. You were a good choice for this. Nothing personal.<br><br>Now, the reactions of two players in particular bothered me: Ircher and BigYoshiFan. I'm fine with voting either one this game phase. I'd need to go back through to link to specific posts for BigYoshiFan, but here's the basic breakdown for both reads:<br><br>BigYoshiFan - his ~scumread~ on titus and his reactions around her were very much of the omgus variety in that it could be boiled down to \"titus' reasoning for suspecting me is bad so titus is suspect\" - his suspicion of titus is artificial at best and is a reaction, not individually spawned. This can be seen by his reaction to people townreading the titus slot as well. <br><br>A lot of BigYoshiFan's sources of suspicion can be summed up with \"what this person did didn't feel genuine\" - there's no way to really poke at this reasoning. And it's not wrong in and of itself. But when it's the reason for most of your reads, it becomes an excuse rather than a reason. He also puts mild efforts to express a townread of Ircher in reaction to people suspecting him. Mind you, associative tells before a flip aren't the best to go off of, but it's a point for why ircher's number two.<br><br>Additionally, his reaction to my case against Gamma was \"<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9213934#p9213934\" class=\"postlink\">I promise more later, but it's intriguing</a>\" with nothing given later. Intriguing and interesting are two words with very similar uses: you say them and it can mean anything you want. Also note BigYoshiFan never shows any suspicion of Gamma prior to or after that post.<br><br>Ircher - Associative tells with BigYoshiFan are the main reason, to be honest. If you look through their interactions and the flow of their reads, there's a lot of them matching up in reads / supporting each other's cases and not a lot of actual direct interaction between them. It's indirect. Agreement, with little conflict of reads (or apparently not enough to converse with each other about their differences for some reason).<br><br>The stuff from today that has been mentioned could be included as well, but that's been covered.<br><br>I'd also like to make a premature claim because I can. I'm a <span class=\"noboldsig\">two shot gunsmith</span>, and I've used both shots on players that I couldn't get a good read on. One is MarioManiac4, the other is Penguin Power. Neither of them have guns. I'm making this claim now because the playerlist is small enough that having these results (especially since I can't get any more) out is beneficial given we don't know how many members of the scumteam there are. If you are a role with limited shots that is investigative and you've used them, I would suggest claiming now.</div></blockquote><br>Alright here we go, I'm gonna hardcore analyze this.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9241881#p9241881\" class=\"postlink\">post 2151</a>, RayFrost wrote:</cite>BigYoshiFan - his ~scumread~ on titus and his reactions around her were very much of the omgus variety in that it could be boiled down to \"titus' reasoning for suspecting me is bad so titus is suspect\" - his suspicion of titus is artificial at best and is a reaction, not individually spawned.

Ircher did not claim yet. Thinking this is scum, I'm trying to find where he found the need to make a fakeclaim and a measure of the risk and reward he gets here. If he's town, he's fully justified claiming here. If he's scum, does he include his partner in his results and risk them being lynched if he, himself is determined to be scum? How likely did he think his claim was to be believed? Why did he feel the need to fakeclaim? How do his posts reflect upon this claim, both before and after? I'm just throwing these questions out to maybe promote discussion here. This claim is really boggling me. Perhaps this shouldn't be the focus for now, but I'm far from completely faithful to this claim, and it's had a huge toll on people's reads."}

I apologize for this error and whatever effects it may have had on the game. <br><br>Town dropped the ball big time when believing Ircher's claim. As a normal game mod, I would never have approved any town protective role along with a 3-shot gunsmith and odd-night cop. A jailkeeper would have made this setup far too townsided."}

All three of these people were uncertain reads on me, so the connective results meant I'd be likely to make further reads. Additionally, MM4 seemed really easy to influence and push toward my way of thinking toward later in the game, which is favorable in that I trust my reads and having someone I can push to follow me is an advantage.<br><br>Reason to not investigate other people: I genuinely did townread gamma after the day 1 interactions, I townread the Tarkus slot, had an iffy read regarding MMM (honestly was leaning scum or hard-scum to me all game), and I felt that the other players were more likely to die if they were town (aside from bigyoshifan - it was a tossup between the two, but yoshi felt like he'd be more stubborn and less likely to sheep me if I pushed for it in a late game situation).<br><br>N2, given the no-gun result on MM4, I was less likely to go with either of ircher / bigyoshifan due to the decreased connective read that I could get. And that day phase passed without me even really getting to be part of it. So it's back to \"who's unlikely to die\" - the lurked slot on penguinpower. There we go. Another hard to read but likely to live to endgame slot.<br><br>N3, I actually wavered between MMM and Priscila, but in the end I decided to go with trying for as many town-confirmations as possible rather than going for a scum confirmation. I felt that I could get that lynch on MMM without many issues regardless, so there's little to no reason to have a guilty on top of it. And at this point, I'm also trying to clear out the people that I am uncertain about in their connections to the read - gamma + MMM / Priscila + MMM / Ircher + MMM were what was left. <br><br>With the discussion of mafia doc etc etc, I felt it was likely that if there was one on the scumteam that of any of the combinations, Ircher's claim made him the most likely to give a false innocent if he's guilty. So, I don't investigate that potential partner. With the others, it's a 50/50 between MMM or the other one giving a potential false innocent. Then, I still have a moderate townread on gamma (it's weakened but still there), so that leaves Priscila.<br><br>Then I got ruined by mod error and mod \"compensation\" lost all motivation to play the game because of the snafu and really lost my hold on the game since I went from a position of power to a position of what is this garbage nonsense and all of the posting surrounding that was essentially a full day of white noise with no purpose."}
