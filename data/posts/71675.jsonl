You're making a lot of inaccurate assumptions here about my level of hubris. That bandwagon during RVS was getting big, but short of a grossly incompetent townie, an accidental hammer was very unlikely. Scum hammering and pretending to be inept town seems like it would have been a far more likely scenario to me. And neither side hammering seems like an even more likely scenario. If we accept that the lynch was extremely unlikely to occur and that scum would be most likely to hammer, then an early lynch would arguably have been more favorable for the town.<br>\n<br>\nOn the other hand, scum can get towncred for pretending to be scared of a lynch that early on. And, if Gamma truly is Yoshi's partner, Yoshi'd have every reason to be nervous, on the off-chance that an incompetent townie accidentally (or purposely, honestly) hammered there.<br>\n<br>\ntl;dr: Irrespective of Gamma's alignment, Yoshi as town had more to gain from Gamma's death than he had to lose, while Yoshi as scum had more to gain from ending the wagon there.<br>\n<br>\nThere are, however, two holes in my thinking that I am aware of.<br>\n<br>\n1. It's possible that Yoshi wouldn't have thought any of the things that I just thought, regardless of his alignment.<br>\n2. I've basically set up a scenario that regardless of how Gamma flips if we lynch him, Yoshi looks scummier to me. <br>\n<br>\nI realize the potential role confirmation bias may play in how I interpret Yoshi's actions from here on, but I don't plan to push forward with only this reasoning. I assume that as the game progresses, my scum read may be strengthened or it may be weakened. But at our current stage in the game, these are the best leads I've got (and I don't think they are bad), so I'm pursuing them until I have reason to believe I shouldn't.<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=9172170#p9172170\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=9172170#p9172170\" data-post-id=\"9172170\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 140</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=2441\">ChannelDelibird</a> wrote:</cite>Hey, people.

I had 5 out of the 83 posts when you voted me. Two were during RTS. One was asking for clarification of a vote that I didn't understand. One was acknowledging that I now understood the previous message. The last was an acknowledgment that my quote was bad, to clarify that I understood that a mistake had been made. Do you have something against clarity of communication? Because I happen to believe it's very important.<br>\n<br>\nOn top of that, you make a really weak accusation that I went into tryhard mode after you voted me, despite the fact that I posted it a mere 10 minutes after your claim that I was posting a lot without saying much. I wish I could produce a post like that in 10 minutes. I usually spend upwards of an hour on a post, which I'll grant, you have no way of verifying. I've got to read, reread, fact-check, contemplate, and solidify my thoughts. Then I have to carefully select my words in order to remove as much ambiguity from my posts as possible, that way it can be clear to everyone exactly what I'm saying. And don't even get me started on the time I spend on BBCode to try to make things as intelligible as possible. Incidentally, that's why I made the comment regarding my messed up quote. Like I said, I'm pretty code with it. What I forgot about this site is that every now and then, when you click the quote button, the quote just appears messed up. I only even realized it because it happened to me again earlier. I'm pretty sure that's a bug that's been around since 2011 and I'm honestly kind of surprised it still exists.<br>\n<br>\nMy point is, even if you question my motives, I like to think that there is very little room for interpretation regarding the content of my words.<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=9172915#p9172915\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=9172915#p9172915\" data-post-id=\"9172915\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 155</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=27478\">Transcend</a> wrote:</cite>As for the Mario read i thought his vote was towny but then read his iso and didn't like some of the posts</div></blockquote>\nCould you please elaborate on this?</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: MortFeld</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\"><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=9172840#p9172840\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=9172840#p9172840\" data-post-id=\"9172840\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 152</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=27041\">MortFeld</a> wrote:</cite>Not any strong reason.

Town have extremely legitimate reasons to worry about looking suspicious. People can and are misinterpreted and mislynched. I can't speak for anyone else, but being mislynched or mistrusted is one of the most frustrating things in this game for me, especially in LyLo. It's possible to interpret that a line of questioning is being asked solely for the purpose of setting you up as a fall guy. This is compounded by the fact that townies are 100% certain that they are innocent and they sometimes overestimate how apparent that should be to everybody else.<br>\n<br>\nThat said, I generally agree with you and I don't think town should live in fear of that. Especially when it comes to vanilla townies. Not that I'm interpreting Yoshi as either a VT or a power role, I'm just saying in terms of game theory, VTs are expendable as hell and should be willing to jump on a grenade for most power roles. Mislynches can and will happen, there's no avoiding it. If it happens to you, it sucks, but oh well. So I think it's better to be loud and proud about your opinions if you are a member of the town and if you die, have some amount of faith that your team will find a way to turn your death into an advantage. Not everybody has that level of dedication to their team though. Some are just here to play a fun game. And there's nothing wrong with that; it's just not as helpful.</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: Ircher</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\"><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=9174462#p9174462\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=9174462#p9174462\" data-post-id=\"9174462\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 208</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=26976\">Ircher</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=9171962#p9171962\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=9171962#p9171962\" data-post-id=\"9171962\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 128</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=16078\">Hikari Link</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=9171909#p9171909\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=9171909#p9171909\" data-post-id=\"9171909\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 109</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=27041\">MortFeld</a> wrote:</cite>Yoshi <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9171018#p9171018\">45</a> town</div></blockquote>\nWhy does this make Yoshi town in any way?<br>\n<br>\nYour points about him are valid, MortFeld.<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Gamma Emerald</span><br>\n<br>\nI'm not letting Yoshi off the hook there, because I still feel like his response to the speedwagon was more likely to come from scum than town.

It seems to me that Yoshi is being defensive against TwoFace while ignoring my accusations and is also not really scumhunting.<br>\n<br>\n2. Transcend has grossly exaggerated the infractions that I've committed that make me scum in his eyes and I'd like to know his reasoning for his reads, particularly on Mario.<br>\n<br>\n3. My emphasis on clear communication is a result of my field of study.<br>\n<br>\n4. My tryhard nature is extremely apparent in any game I've been in on this site. It has nothing to do with my role and everything to do with my playstyle.<br>\n<br>\n5. I don't fully understand Mort's misgivings about my Yoshi vote, because I feel I've sufficiently explained it. If it needs more elaboration, please ask. If it's just a gut thing, please say so.<br>\n<br>\n6. I'd like Mario to explain his reads.<br>\n<br>\n7. TwoFace already covered this in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9174563#p9174563\" class=\"postlink\">#210</a>, but Mort's line of questioning was valid.<br>\n<br>\n8.

I'm paranoid about people buddying me and that all of my reads are wrong. These things may cause me to react irrationally at points.

There is literally no reason a townie should have to say something like that. His entire iso is basically LAMIST (look at me I'm so town). It's forced and unnatural (not to mention scummy) and because of that I can't trust him. I can't see town motivation for it.", "time": "Thu May 04, 2017 12:31 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=71675&start=375", "forum": "53", "thread": "71675"}

If they were scum, they were fairly caught. So if you say that they weren't caught scum, it sounds like a trust tell. I'm not trying to misrepresent you, I just want to understand where you are coming from.</div></blockquote>Wagons can easily shift over time even if for a few days there are only a couple of people that are being focused on/wagoned. Unless 75% of the town says a person is scum (or there is evidence from a cop/similar), wagons can change, and therefore scum is not caught at all.<br>\nJust because there is a large wagon on you, heck even if it's at L-1, does not mean that if you replace out the reasoning HAS to be that you're caught scum.</div></blockquote>\nI feel like we have different definitions of \"caught.\" And you're applying your definition as though everybody feels it is the same definition. For all you know, one or both of them could feel that L-2 is serious enough to be considered caught.<br>\n<br>\nThat said, I'm not saying that caught scum necessarily have to replace out because they are caught. They can be caught and they can be scum and they can replace out, but that doesn't me that they replaced out because they were caught scum.</div></blockquote>We might have. And yes, I do tend to assume that I am obviously in the right a lot of the time even if it's not really obvious and sometimes even if I'm not right. Perhaps all my viewpoints on the matter of subbing out come from the fact that I have a somewhat petty dislike for giving up until having actually tried everything I could.</div></blockquote>\n[/quote]Again, you're misunderstanding me and your feelings on giving up aren't relevant here, because what I said has nothing to do with giving up. <br>\n<br>\nI'm saying that different people have different ideas of when they are caught. For example, I tend to feel caught as scum when 15%-25% of people suspect me and or when nobody townreads me. So you can't (or at least, shouldn't) apply your definition of caught to them when you don't know when they feel like they are caught.<br>\n<br>\nOn top of that, I'm saying that both Titus and Transcend could've considered themselves caught scum, yet still replaced out because they didn't like the attitudes of players in the game. I'm not trying to argue with you here, I'm just pointing out that there can be differences in communication and perspective that can be barriers to understanding somebody's motivations.</div></div></div>", "time": "Sun May 07, 2017 10:19 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=71675&start=800", "forum": "53", "thread": "71675"}

See the similarities between you and kop?) you had no legit reasons for your scum read on kop. So yay you found scum based purely on luck. <br>\n3. You ONLY voted the one of the scum because he was the alternative to you. This other scum just so happened to be the person you were hard town reading almost the entire game and refused to explain to anyone why. You did a 180 out of the blue.

If they were scum, they were fairly caught. So if you say that they weren't caught scum, it sounds like a trust tell. I'm not trying to misrepresent you, I just want to understand where you are coming from.</div></blockquote>Wagons can easily shift over time even if for a few days there are only a couple of people that are being focused on/wagoned. Unless 75% of the town says a person is scum (or there is evidence from a cop/similar), wagons can change, and therefore scum is not caught at all.<br>\nJust because there is a large wagon on you, heck even if it's at L-1, does not mean that if you replace out the reasoning HAS to be that you're caught scum.</div></blockquote>\nI feel like we have different definitions of \"caught.\" And you're applying your definition as though everybody feels it is the same definition. For all you know, one or both of them could feel that L-2 is serious enough to be considered caught.<br>\n<br>\nThat said, I'm not saying that caught scum necessarily have to replace out because they are caught. They can be caught and they can be scum and they can replace out, but that doesn't me that they replaced out because they were caught scum.</div></blockquote>We might have. And yes, I do tend to assume that I am obviously in the right a lot of the time even if it's not really obvious and sometimes even if I'm not right. Perhaps all my viewpoints on the matter of subbing out come from the fact that I have a somewhat petty dislike for giving up until having actually tried everything I could.</div></blockquote>\nAgain, you're misunderstanding me and your feelings on giving up aren't relevant here, because what I said has nothing to do with giving up. <br>\n<br>\nI'm saying that different people have different ideas of when they are caught. For example, I tend to feel caught as scum when 15%-25% of people suspect me and or when nobody townreads me. So you can't (or at least, shouldn't) apply your definition of caught to them when you don't know when they feel like they are caught.<br>\n<br>\nOn top of that, I'm saying that both Titus and Transcend could've considered themselves caught scum, yet still replaced out because they didn't like the attitudes of players in the game. I'm not trying to argue with you here, I'm just pointing out that there can be differences in communication and perspective that can be barriers to understanding somebody's motivations.</div></div></div></div></blockquote>Sorry your posts are very tl;dr-y and I try to read the full posts regardless of whether they address me to gain full understanding of your viewpoints and when it does address me, like just now, I lose sight of what we're actually arguing about. Or in this case talking since, according to you, you're not arguing (which I now only have a vague recollection of - exams are stressful).<br>\nIf you'd like me to say anything else about this reiterate please and I'll have a look at it again.<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=9192728#p9192728\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=9192728#p9192728\" data-post-id=\"9192728\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 821</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=29515\">Tarkus</a> wrote:</cite>As I see it we're bogged down in two slots that are now empty, and I have a strong feeling that scum's pretty content with the game state.

Mainly cause you avoid posting daily. The problem with these posts is it is impossible to read and respond to on a mobile device cause you have to keep going back and forth in your browser. You can't easily quote specific information without losing the hyperlink to the post number and by the time you reach the bottom you've gone back and forth 30 times. Hell its difficult to respond on a computer also for essentially the same reasons. <br>\n<br>\nIm willing to bet most people would prefer you quote a post, say what you have an issue with, and move to the next post. Plus not everything you include in these posts need to be included. You throw things in that have either been answered already or are now irrelevant. <br>\n<br>\nI can understand doing it after catching up from a replacement. But doing it after a weekend or any other time after the catch-up is completely unnecessary. You actually hurt town by not allowing them to directly interact with you.

And my comment towards you in no way warranted that sort of over reaction.  I think you have spent too much time around 2F.  I simply read through the last 10 pages last night and noticed a couple of your posts along the lines of not being as active lately as you want to.  So what?  Did it change my read of you?  No.  It was a minor observation.<br>\n<br>\nIf I had made the same observation but said \"I'm town reading Mort...mostly for his early play, but he seems to have tailed off a bit on his activity.  But still a town read for now.\"  Would you still have responded with a \"f**k you?\"  Which was totally uncalled for and a bit of a surprise coming from you based on your play up to that point.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nSpeaking of behavior...<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: TwoFace</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\">Your play in this game (and others) goes beyond unacceptable.  The fact you yourself feel the need to change your play...and even you admit you are an asshole when you play mafia shows you are aware of your MASSIVE personality/teamwork flaws.  Every game I have seen you in you get into nasty exchanges with people (not just me) that more often than not just lead to people replacing out or mislynches thanks to you.  I suspect that the reason you do not want to share your previous main's identity...that you claim experience playing with me as...is because it was probably banned for assholery and you are playing as TwoFace to skirt the ban.  Maybe a TwoFace ban is somewhere close in the future.  One can dream <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\"><br>\n<br>\nIn this game alone you have had major issues with four players and you have been admonished or criticized by at least four others!  That's EIGHT players that have had exchanges with you based on your behavior and not the game.  Maybe more that I just overlooked.  And that eight is not counting the mod who has had to try and reel in gameplay (to little avail).<br>\n<br>\nOur last game (<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">which you signed up for after I did you hypocrite</div>) you weren't quite as bad as you have been in this \"new improved\" version of you.  And after I was mislynched in large part due to you you still flaked out of that game for in part...player incompatibilities.  Scum even thanked you after the game for being such a valuable member of their team...and you were town!  lol....<br>\n<br>\nAnother example was recent completed game I chose not to replace into because you, DSOC, were having a \"toxic\" exchange with another player (MOI) that resulted in you getting kicked out of the game.  It goes on and on...smh....<br>\n<br>\nI'm not really sure why you even play this game.  You are obviously socially challenged.  All you do is complain about other people in your games....you whine like a little ____ to mods and site admins for the slightest offense and you act like a total child.  I envision you falling on the floor next to your computer and throwing a tantrum when something pisses you off.  It's absurd.<br>\n<br>\nAnd yet you're hilarious at the same time.  The points you make are assinine at best and usually misguided.  Your reads are terrible and yet you have never done anything wrong in the game of Mafia.  Anyone you have ever been wrong about when you are town is at fault.  It's their fault they got mislynched...they didn't act town.  They were scummy.  Not your bad.<br>\n<br>\nBullshit!  lol.....<br>\n<br>\nAnd to say you hate someone on this website who is just trying to play a game is psychotic.  Someone who your primary objections to are related to post formatting!? It's just a game that you are bad at and make other people miserable in...except scum.  If you are seeing a therapist I would recommend you ask them to up your meds.  If you aren't....you should consider seeing one immediately.  I would be very afraid to be in any post offices in your neighborhood.<br>\n<br>\nI will not avoid playing in games you are in if I'm interested in the player list.  If that makes you miserable....that's your problem.  I have no problem being in a game with you and will not penalize myself by avoiding the chance to play with players I actually look forward to playing with just because of your cancerous presence.</div></div></div><br>\nAs for this game...I'm not scum.  I can't defend anything Titus did but those scum reading her are wrong (or scum).

I've just been pretty busy and catching up here has been difficult. Mostly just been skimming recently.<br>\n<br>\nLooking at the Wiki, it seems like the Watcher is generally considered a pretty cheap role as town, but a pretty acceptable role as scum, so I suppose maybe their is something to TwoFace's concerns regarding a fake claim. Of course, he also said that a Mafia Double Voter is pretty uncommon. It could be completely possible that the mod has gone with a setup that's balanced, but full of relatively unused roles. So if TwoFace ever flips scum or havingfitz flips town, we may want to start looking at the other.<br>\n<br>\nFor now, I say we let fitz live and see if he can bring us actionable information. Honestly, I kinda just want this day to end so we can get a flip and stop poking around in the dark.

So, w/ RVS et cetera, there isn't going to be a lot to analyze so questions won't have a lot of depth.

I thought he replaced in and made genuine efforts to make progress and was very like-minded to what I was thinking.  He posted a shitload in a short amount of time and didn't care if he pissed anyone off as long as he was<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Tarkus - </div>he was a non entity until page 15 and then he kicked things into gear.  Clear and concise and not hiding what he's thinking which will help keep him accountable/read him as the game goes on.  He could have stayed quiet with my wagon and let its momentum carry on but he voiced objection to it and tried to reign in the game.  I know scum could do that for towncred but Tarkus feels town.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">MortFeld - </div>I haven't really had a problem with any of Mort posts.  I liked his early game efforts to get the game moving.  The only real negative (aside from the activity thing I mentioned later which I'm not really that hung up on) is that some of the pushes he made on Gamma seemed unfounded IMO.  Ex. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9175299#p9175299\">246</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9175299#p9175299\"> 246</a>.  I'm undecided atm on Gamma and I still like Mort as town but I feel these two pushes are misguided.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">MarioManiac - </div>Didn't really notice him much on my catch up...not a good thing...until <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9190129#p9190129\">Post 770</a>.  Very similar to my thoughts on people.  Like minded to me is good.  Not sure why he was reading TwoFace as null at one point in the game but he's stepped up his participation after a slow start.  Engaged and likeminded = tr for me.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">ChannelDelibird - </div>nada.  Was looking forward to playing with CDB but I suspect this will be a replace out. (Same with the RayFrost slot)<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">MMM - </div>Even though he has posted a lot he is kind of nul.  I'm having a hard time finding a preponderance of good or bad stuff to push me one way or the other.  I know people have called him out for a few things but he seems to explain himself out of situatiojns.  Because he's town and there was no issue to begin with or because he's scum and can form decent explanations?  IDK.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Gamma Emerald - </div>I didn't like him giving out early TR's on Mort and BYF (post 33?).  Other than that...I know as I was going through my catch up I was feeling suspicion towards Gamma but in hindsight I don't think it was for anything he had done himself than as much as it was a residual feeling from all the suspicion (votes anyway) from others.  Kind of a where there's smoke there's fire thing.  I don't like his wanting to string me up to potentially make use of a tell which is questionable to begin with...would require that I actually flip scum...and would have required that I'd actually provided some content to work from.  And as I had not provided any reads up to this point and as I am not scum...this was a pretty bad plan...smh.  This \"bad plan\" is probably the main thing I dislike about the slot but I don't want subliminal omgus to cloud my view.  Probably my weakest suspect.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Ircher - </div>It took 22 posts before I saw one with what I would consider any real game related effort and that was a vote on my slot for what appears to be meta reasons associated with 2 players (Titus and Transcend).  So meta squared.  Ugh.  That seems worse than pre-flip associations.  Then when people point out Titus read is based on meta, he produces a completely different set of reasons for suspecting Titus.  All, but pt #5, which were not mentioned when he voted Titus.  So looking for reasons after the fact to help justify read.  Also not sure what his issue is with my role.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">BigYoshiFan - </div> Didn't care for <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9175768#p9175768\">Post 276</a> when I first read it and in hindsight...still don't.  Not sure how the reasons given warrant a tr.  Same with giving Transcend a tr for replacing out and what I perceived as buttering up to a generally concensus regarded TR (Hiraki).  Stayed on TwoFace quite some time after double voter was confirmed without ever really giving a reason for the 2F vote in the first place...or even mentioning any consideration of the DV.  Then BYF decides transcend is town but maintains a vote on him for 30+ posts.  Only a little over an hour realtime though.  It bugged me more when I first saw it but I'm not sure I see any motivation in it...it's just struck me as odd.  FMPOV...if I'm town and I suspect someone I'm going to vote them because my vote is all I have and I'm judicious with it.  If I decide a scum read is suddenly town...my vote is coming off in the same post.  Or the next one.  I.e. I don't vote or maintain votes on townreads.  It just bugs me that BYF did.  Like his vote being on a tr didn't really matter.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Whemestar - </div>I always think Transcend is scum.  Not intentionally.  And I'm not sure if I have seen his scum game or not to know if there's a difference.  I didn't care for a lot of the reads he threw out.  It felt like he was just throwing them out there to see if any gained traction.  His <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9171938#p9171938\">overreaction</a> to an MMM scum listing seemed too over the top....fake.  And his exit/not exit/exit was just too WIFOMy for me to give any kind of relief for.  And Whemestar hasn't done anything of note since joining either.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nSo these are my reads as they currently stand.  I think the only people I would actively support being lynched today would be Wheme, BYF and Ircher.<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Whemestar</span>", "time": "Thu May 11, 2017 4:45 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=71675&start=1125", "forum": "53", "thread": "71675"}

His reads look fine imo and show a town thought process. It seems more like Titus is simpl trying to find something she can attack herself -- how ironic!</div><br>\n<br>\n2. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9173560#p9173560\">171</a> --&gt; Elaborates on Mort read; mainly states that Mort's stuff lacks depth and asks too many questions --&gt; <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Honestly, I still feel like Titus is trying to find things to attack; Titus made the original read about 1 1/2 pages into the game. So, w/ RVS et cetera, there isn't going to be a lot to analyze so questions won't have a lot of depth. While the # of Qs Mort asked was kinda high, I don't necessarily see it as scum-motivated.</div><br>\n<br>\n3. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9173590#p9173590\">177</a> --&gt; Admits reasoning was bad cuz trying to get things going --&gt; <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">And this feels like Titus is distancing from her read. Had she said this way earlier, I might buy it, but this seems to be Titus thinking \"Oops! I better try to play that read off as non-serious\". I don't buy it at all.</div><br>\n<br>\n4. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9173594#p9173594\">178</a> --&gt; Mort/Yoshi pinged her as partners --&gt; <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">This early in the game? I mean, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9171615#p9171615\">68</a> kinda pinged me as Titus / MMM being possible partners, but by no means did I see a solid association between the two. Unless Titus elaborates later, this association read feels superficial and an attempt to appear to have reads while simultaneously casting shade at another player.</div><br>\n<br>\n5. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9173720#p9173720\">182</a> --&gt; Transcend is weak town --&gt; <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">I would like to note that this happened after Transcend said that town!Titus pretty much always defends him at this point in the game. Titus is obviously trying to keep her options open.</div><br>\n<br>\n6. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9179147#p9179147\">387</a> --&gt; Asks how Tarkus can see things as her on Mort despite not understanding Titus's posts --&gt; <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Different perspective perhaps? Feels like another shade-throwing attempt. Not to mention that Titus hasn't been too specific in her read, so it's pretty difficult to understand when one quotes zero evidence.</div><br>\n<br>\n7. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9179232#p9179232\">408</a> --&gt; Says town!Trans actually pressures people --&gt; <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">What suggests he isn't? Also, I honestly don't see the difference between Transcend here and Transcend in 1900.

I'd expect a little bit more in terms of variance, given that they are different players. Overall, I'm not in love with any of them for a Day 1 lynch, because I prefer fitz.

But by my hidden metric (which I am working on game by game and which I can't reveal because it can be manipulated) he feels town.

They can easily hide behind the other options and just say that they think the scum target is town or that they have stronger scumreads. But there should only 3 in a setup of this size, so it's not like they have absolute control over the vote. On top of that, there's plenty of motivation for scum to bus here. I can't speak for anybody else, but I have no problem bussing for towncred Day 1 (or any other day, for that matter). So to say that the leading wagons have virtually no chance of being scum strikes me as a bit narrow-minded.<br>\n<br>\nI'm not saying I want us to mislynch here; quite the opposite. I'm just saying it's just not that likely that we're going to catch scum right now, with our lack of information. And since it's not that likely, I'm not going to be heartbroken if it's a mislynch. You say that scum are happily sitting about and letting this happen? Prove it. Let the mislynch happen and then start analyzing who pushed those lynches, rather than the alternative. Because it's the people with strong feelings right now that are the most worrisome to me. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">It's not like you have to worry about dying tonight, MortFeld. You and I are the obvious Doctor bait right now. Scum would be fools to target us. And a Doctor would be a fool to target anyone but us. And that includes TwoFace.

I can see scum using that as a ploy to look like frustrated town.

The fact that it has been consistent over players bothers me a little though.<br>\n<br>\n6a. Why does that make PP scummy? When did he make the case? Can you provide a link? <br>\n<br>\n6b.

Not to say I condone lynching TwoFace, but other than an informative role investigating him, there's no way for something to come up based on his role.

Actually I'd say it's kind of similar to MM4's. Basically there is a very large group of people in a town pool and the lynch pool is those who are not in the town pool.<br>\n<br>\nBut the latter group is pretty arbitrary if that is the criterion. I think in order to even consider lynching Rayfrost you'd need to explain why Greyposting was not town because Grey posted a lot of content. And there are some people missing (me, Wheme, GE, MMM(?)) where the onus is on Ircher to explain why.<br>\n<br>\nSo you have Ircher's lynch pool in which neither Wheme nor GE are included, and then this big post by Hikari where they go 'Ok so consensus says Wheme and GE are the lynches now vote one of them' and all Ircher says is 'well hey, lynching lurkers isn't all bad!'<br>\n<br>\nI don't think he's on my team this game.<br>\n<br>\nOriginally I thought <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9211502#p9211502\">1592</a> was very bad. But the first part is not bad at all. And the second only has one minor issue which I don't even blame town!MM4 for.</div></blockquote>\n1) Your first point still fails to parse. You randomly asked me if I'm mafia and quoted that post. What about my assumption does not make sense? If you scumread me for different reasons, why would you quote that post in particular? And this site has a general meta of scumreading people who present viewpoints that are contrary to what you believe even if it isn't alignment-indicative.<br>\n<br>\n2) I townread you and Gamma for early game reasons. I already expressed the reason as to why I would prefer not lynching Wheme. You may have a point about MMM, but I remember having a weak soft townread on them. And, I'm pretty sure RayFrost didn't replace Grey, and I have yet to see anything from Frost that makes me lean town there.<br>\n<br>\n3) Again, I disagree with both a Gamma and a Wheme lynch rn and townread the majority of the active players.

There has always been a lingering shadow of doubt over that slot. On top of which, Wheme is pretty much a done deal. You can let it happen without having to be on a mislynch if Wheme is town. And you'd even be able to get some towncred for trying to push a counterwagon. Plus, because of the negative sentiment towards Wheme, even if you made a Gamma lynch happen today, you could easily get a Wheme lynch to happen tomorrow. As scum you'd have so many options here that I don't even know why you feel the need ask how this is favorable, other than in hopes that I won't think of the various reasons this is a good move for you as scum.<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=9214594#p9214594\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=9214594#p9214594\" data-post-id=\"9214594\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 1771</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=11994\">RayFrost</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Master Horn, a unicorn to the past wrote:</cite>Nah, being assertive isn't the issue.

But it's more that we disagree and I feel that you should know better. Like, the case isn't bad, per se, but I feel like there are extenuating circumstances to consider.

It's actually kind of a compliment, in a weird way. <br>\n<br>\nAs a result, I tend to become automatically suspicious that players like you are trying to pull a fast one on me. I don't think it's ever happened yet, but I'm scared it will happen one day. I'm admittedly not completely rational as a result of these feelings. If you aren't confirmed town and we make it to LyLo together, I'll probably be even more suspicious of you. But I'll probably end up siding with you, because I won't let paranoia be my ultimate decision maker.

By saying \"Doc is probably going to protect these people,\" it may give scum pause to not take out the most useful people. And the protective players might then want to consider focusing elsewhere. It's almost like having two layers of protection. Of course, saying this now, scum may be more inclined to strike pro-town players. Which may make protective people more likely to protect them.

We have to consider the circumstances around the lynch, we have to consider who supported the lynch, we have to consider who opposed the lynch, and we have to consider the types of interactions you had.

Mort and Gamma clearly don't want to lynch you. You're not Ray's first choice. Tarkus didn't scumread you, I don't think. Mario is only voting you because Ircher is a tougher lynch.

We'd need to get him to L-1 and then he'd need to claim. And if his claim was a PR, we'd just have to all quickly switch back to Wheme (which, if he's scum, he'd definitely do at this point). So he's ultimately not going to end up lynched and if he's town, only scum stand to benefit.

But then Yoshi stole my post, so I had to pivot to something else. I decided to breadcrumb with the first letter of the first word of the first sentence of my first post, the second word of the second sentence of my second post, and the third word of the third sentence of my third post. Technically, Vote was the first letter of my first sentence, but I decided to just run with it, since it was close enough and sufficiently subtle that I wouldn't be caught.<br>\n<br>\nI anticipated that I might have to reveal my breadcrumb at several stages in the game, so I didn't leave any clues other clues in my first post, but I always had plans for my second and third post. The initial claim was supposed to be Full Cop Day 2, that way I could draw protective roles to me and get a potential roleblock on me Night 2 (when I couldn't do anything anyway). <br>\n<br>\nDay 3 I was supposed to point to my second post and say that I was breadcrumbing that I was a One-Shot Cop, that way scum wouldn't bother to Roleblock me Night 3. I was still going to argue for protection though, with the assertion that my claim makes me essentially confirmed town and so I'd be valuable to keep around.<br>\n<br>\nDay 4, I was supposed to reveal my results and let everybody know I had been an Odd-Night Cop the whole time. My third post was meant to be the final hint, which is why I specifically said \"every other,\" to indicate that I could use my effect every other night. But then the Roleblocker got lynched and the necessity of that plan went out the window. And since I'm replacing out anyway, I thought it would be better to reveal my breadcrumb now, that way people could see why this isn't just a fakeclaim, but a plan that has been in the making since the beginning.<br>\n<br>\nAlso, one of the reasons I was trying to rush through Day 1 was because I just wanted to Cop fitz already, since I felt really good about him as scum.", "time": "Sun May 21, 2017 10:09 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=71675&start=2000", "forum": "53", "thread": "71675"}

Posts like <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9182328#p9182328\">594</a> are just annoying fluff. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9182488#p9182488\">615</a> would've been fine if there wasn't the \"probably\" at the end. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9183246#p9183246\">645</a> is a bad joke. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9183293#p9183293\">651</a> is fine I guess. Lots of Ray's early posts are excuses as to why he cannot catch up, but I'm not questioning their legitimacy right now.

Alas, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9205126#p9205126\">1209</a> being true seems to be a thing on this site. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9211502#p9211502\">1592</a>: \"I have posted 78 times\" -- Maybe 15 of them are actually useful?

Not sure what made you think <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9212393#p9212393\">1655</a> but to clarify, what you ruled out is more as to what I meant. (Perhaps my statement was ambiguous to some extent, but your flat out refusal to accept my explanation is obnoxious.) <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9212902#p9212902\">1683</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9213142#p9213142\">1690</a> are decent posts. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9232169#p9232169\">2010</a> is a good post (as well as the earlier vote.)<br>\n<br>\nDelbird/Penguin (-42%) - <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9172170#p9172170\">140</a> really doesn't read right.

I am always a sucker for people scumreading my scumreads. But having read Grey's content strongly as scum I suppose I'm less inclined to glaze over and hand out a townread for it, and I'm now noticing how one-dimensional the attack is. All of Ray's reads are oriented around his Gamma scumread. There's no nuance to it. He dislikes the Ircher wagon because Gamma is on it. He finds MM4 scummy because of how he has treated the Gamma wagon. I'm also noticing how superficially aggressive the push is.

{"number": 2151, "id": "9241881", "user": "RayFrost", "user_id": "11994", "content": "I'd like to start by going ahead with this: <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: BigYoshiFan</div><br>\n<br>\nI'd like to state that I currently have a <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">townread</div> on Gamma. And I never really had a scumread on him. His reaction to my accusations on day 1 was quite towny (which brought him from null to town), and the reactions of other players around those accusations were more suspect. My main motivation for pushing him was that I had felt it was highly unlikely a wagon would actually shift to him (I didn't want more claims, really) and it was highly likely people would be willing to discuss it (other pushes felt less likely to get any substance from the others). Sorry to Gamma. You were a good choice for this. Nothing personal.<br>\n<br>\nNow, the reactions of two players in particular bothered me: Ircher and BigYoshiFan. I'm fine with voting either one this game phase. I'd need to go back through to link to specific posts for BigYoshiFan, but here's the basic breakdown for both reads:<br>\n<br>\nBigYoshiFan - his ~scumread~ on titus and his reactions around her were very much of the omgus variety in that it could be boiled down to \"titus' reasoning for suspecting me is bad so titus is suspect\" - his suspicion of titus is artificial at best and is a reaction, not individually spawned. This can be seen by his reaction to people townreading the titus slot as well. <br>\n<br>\nA lot of BigYoshiFan's sources of suspicion can be summed up with \"what this person did didn't feel genuine\" - there's no way to really poke at this reasoning. And it's not wrong in and of itself. But when it's the reason for most of your reads, it becomes an excuse rather than a reason. He also puts mild efforts to express a townread of Ircher in reaction to people suspecting him. Mind you, associative tells before a flip aren't the best to go off of, but it's a point for why ircher's number two.<br>\n<br>\nAdditionally, his reaction to my case against Gamma was \"<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9213934#p9213934\" class=\"postlink\">I promise more later, but it's intriguing</a>\" with nothing given later. Intriguing and interesting are two words with very similar uses: you say them and it can mean anything you want. Also note BigYoshiFan never shows any suspicion of Gamma prior to or after that post.<br>\n<br>\nIrcher - Associative tells with BigYoshiFan are the main reason, to be honest. If you look through their interactions and the flow of their reads, there's a lot of them matching up in reads / supporting each other's cases and not a lot of actual direct interaction between them. It's indirect. Agreement, with little conflict of reads (or apparently not enough to converse with each other about their differences for some reason).<br>\n<br>\nThe stuff from today that has been mentioned could be included as well, but that's been covered.<br>\n<br>\nI'd also like to make a premature claim because I can. I'm a <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">two shot gunsmith</div>, and I've used both shots on players that I couldn't get a good read on. One is MarioManiac4, the other is Penguin Power. Neither of them have guns. I'm making this claim now because the playerlist is small enough that having these results (especially since I can't get any more) out is beneficial given we don't know how many members of the scumteam there are. If you are a role with limited shots that is investigative and you've used them, I would suggest claiming now.", "time": "Tue May 23, 2017 12:53 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=71675&start=2150", "forum": "53", "thread": "71675"}

And I never really had a scumread on him. His reaction to my accusations on day 1 was quite towny (which brought him from null to town), and the reactions of other players around those accusations were more suspect. My main motivation for pushing him was that I had felt it was highly unlikely a wagon would actually shift to him (I didn't want more claims, really) and it was highly likely people would be willing to discuss it (other pushes felt less likely to get any substance from the others). Sorry to Gamma. You were a good choice for this. Nothing personal.<br>\n<br>\nNow, the reactions of two players in particular bothered me: Ircher and BigYoshiFan. I'm fine with voting either one this game phase. I'd need to go back through to link to specific posts for BigYoshiFan, but here's the basic breakdown for both reads:<br>\n<br>\nBigYoshiFan - his ~scumread~ on titus and his reactions around her were very much of the omgus variety in that it could be boiled down to \"titus' reasoning for suspecting me is bad so titus is suspect\" - his suspicion of titus is artificial at best and is a reaction, not individually spawned. This can be seen by his reaction to people townreading the titus slot as well. <br>\n<br>\nA lot of BigYoshiFan's sources of suspicion can be summed up with \"what this person did didn't feel genuine\" - there's no way to really poke at this reasoning. And it's not wrong in and of itself. But when it's the reason for most of your reads, it becomes an excuse rather than a reason. He also puts mild efforts to express a townread of Ircher in reaction to people suspecting him. Mind you, associative tells before a flip aren't the best to go off of, but it's a point for why ircher's number two.<br>\n<br>\nAdditionally, his reaction to my case against Gamma was \"<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9213934#p9213934\" class=\"postlink\">I promise more later, but it's intriguing</a>\" with nothing given later. Intriguing and interesting are two words with very similar uses: you say them and it can mean anything you want. Also note BigYoshiFan never shows any suspicion of Gamma prior to or after that post.<br>\n<br>\nIrcher - Associative tells with BigYoshiFan are the main reason, to be honest. If you look through their interactions and the flow of their reads, there's a lot of them matching up in reads / supporting each other's cases and not a lot of actual direct interaction between them. It's indirect. Agreement, with little conflict of reads (or apparently not enough to converse with each other about their differences for some reason).<br>\n<br>\nThe stuff from today that has been mentioned could be included as well, but that's been covered.<br>\n<br>\nI'd also like to make a premature claim because I can. I'm a <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">two shot gunsmith</div>, and I've used both shots on players that I couldn't get a good read on. One is MarioManiac4, the other is Penguin Power. Neither of them have guns. I'm making this claim now because the playerlist is small enough that having these results (especially since I can't get any more) out is beneficial given we don't know how many members of the scumteam there are. If you are a role with limited shots that is investigative and you've used them, I would suggest claiming now.</div></blockquote>\nOkay, so I'm considering those two (MM4 and PP) soft cleared for now<br>\nI forgot who the cop was :'(, can someone refresh me", "time": "Tue May 23, 2017 12:33 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=71675&start=2175", "forum": "53", "thread": "71675"}

I sure think you can. Your join date is quite recent, and the tone, especially when you say \"genuinely\" didn't rub me the right way.<br>\n2. The emphasis I was intending was not that it had attention to detail, but that it was regarding RVS, if that makes sense. Asserting reads largely based on RVS and the early game, as it seemed like that when I had comforted you on this, isn't very helpful. <br>\n3. What I mean by this is that you begin to incorporate the other parts of the game into your reads. <br>\n4. I am nitpicking. I'm just mentioning it because it is something that I didn't like and it specifically pertained to your read on me. I was expecting from this; however, a little more.... analysis?

However, assuming that Ray's claim is true, I still think that Mafia Doctor would make sense since I feel like we would have way too much power otherwise considering we have two inspecting roles and a Jailkeeper on top of that.<br>\nObviously that is false if your speculation that scum has a Rolecop is accurate - a Mafia Doctor on top of that would become too scumsided. However, how sure are you that there is a Mafia Rolecop? I feel like Roleblocker should do the job on its own there and Godfather/Doctor would make more sense here, in particular Doctor so that there are two roles messing with the Gunsmith's investigations - one giving a false negative, and one giving a false positive.<br>\nI'll have a look at the games you linked whenever I get round to posting things about Mario/Yoshi/Ray btw.<br>\n<br>\nPedit: Yoshi sniped me to part of this post", "time": "Thu May 25, 2017 2:38 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=71675&start=2350", "forum": "53", "thread": "71675"}

Again, it was gonna be a starting point for me to start sorting people had day not ended prematurely.

(I'm not treating the GS inspects as locktown unless Ray actually flips since I'm sceptical of the claim for reasons I have outlined and even if he flips GS, Mafia Doctor is still a possibility meaning that one, but not two of his innos could be scum)<br>\n2. I'd want to call myself town as either alignment. Do think about it though - if he didn't have accurate reads, why would he be killed over Kelvin at the time? On Night 1, there would unlikely be any drawback to killing him, and basically everyone thought he was town, whereas 1-2 people expressed concerns over Mort (if I remember correctly, I might be wrong), and on top of that Kelvin was a PR and Mort wasn't, though I don't know how much scum knew about their roles at the time.<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=9248185#p9248185\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=9248185#p9248185\" data-post-id=\"9248185\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 2374</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=25801\">MarioManiac4</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=9248178#p9248178\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=9248178#p9248178\" data-post-id=\"9248178\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 2373</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=11994\">RayFrost</a> wrote:</cite>Typically, gunsmith would not result in a \"has a gun\" for jailkeeper as far as I know.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Mod: By your definition of role interactions, if a gunsmith were to inspect a hypothetical jailkeeper, would it result in a result of having a gun or would it result in not having a gun?</div><br>\n<br>\nAs this is a purely hypothetical scenario that can't happen anyway given my two shots being up,</div></blockquote>\n\"In Normal games on mafiascum.net, a Gunsmith gets guilties on all Mafia (except Traitors and Doctors), Cops, Vigilantes, Gunsmiths, Role Cops, Vanilla Cops, Backups of roles with guns and JoATs that have any of these listed powers.\"<br>\nAs this is a Normal game, you would not get a Gun result on a Jailkeeper- if this was the case your role would be greylisted and you would have been notified of this in your PM.

I'm not meticulous, and I really tend to do things as I go along, which I think this is a good example of.

And I never really had a scumread on him. His reaction to my accusations on day 1 was quite towny (which brought him from null to town), and the reactions of other players around those accusations were more suspect. My main motivation for pushing him was that I had felt it was highly unlikely a wagon would actually shift to him (I didn't want more claims, really) and it was highly likely people would be willing to discuss it (other pushes felt less likely to get any substance from the others). Sorry to Gamma. You were a good choice for this. Nothing personal.<br>\n<br>\nNow, the reactions of two players in particular bothered me: Ircher and BigYoshiFan. I'm fine with voting either one this game phase. I'd need to go back through to link to specific posts for BigYoshiFan, but here's the basic breakdown for both reads:<br>\n<br>\nBigYoshiFan - his ~scumread~ on titus and his reactions around her were very much of the omgus variety in that it could be boiled down to \"titus' reasoning for suspecting me is bad so titus is suspect\" - his suspicion of titus is artificial at best and is a reaction, not individually spawned. This can be seen by his reaction to people townreading the titus slot as well. <br>\n<br>\nA lot of BigYoshiFan's sources of suspicion can be summed up with \"what this person did didn't feel genuine\" - there's no way to really poke at this reasoning. And it's not wrong in and of itself. But when it's the reason for most of your reads, it becomes an excuse rather than a reason. He also puts mild efforts to express a townread of Ircher in reaction to people suspecting him. Mind you, associative tells before a flip aren't the best to go off of, but it's a point for why ircher's number two.<br>\n<br>\nAdditionally, his reaction to my case against Gamma was \"<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9213934#p9213934\" class=\"postlink\">I promise more later, but it's intriguing</a>\" with nothing given later. Intriguing and interesting are two words with very similar uses: you say them and it can mean anything you want. Also note BigYoshiFan never shows any suspicion of Gamma prior to or after that post.<br>\n<br>\nIrcher - Associative tells with BigYoshiFan are the main reason, to be honest. If you look through their interactions and the flow of their reads, there's a lot of them matching up in reads / supporting each other's cases and not a lot of actual direct interaction between them. It's indirect. Agreement, with little conflict of reads (or apparently not enough to converse with each other about their differences for some reason).<br>\n<br>\nThe stuff from today that has been mentioned could be included as well, but that's been covered.<br>\n<br>\nI'd also like to make a premature claim because I can. I'm a <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">two shot gunsmith</div>, and I've used both shots on players that I couldn't get a good read on. One is MarioManiac4, the other is Penguin Power. Neither of them have guns. I'm making this claim now because the playerlist is small enough that having these results (especially since I can't get any more) out is beneficial given we don't know how many members of the scumteam there are. If you are a role with limited shots that is investigative and you've used them, I would suggest claiming now.</div></blockquote>\nAlright here we go, I'm gonna hardcore analyze this.<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=9241881#p9241881\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=9241881#p9241881\" data-post-id=\"9241881\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 2151</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=11994\">RayFrost</a> wrote:</cite>BigYoshiFan - his ~scumread~ on titus and his reactions around her were very much of the omgus variety in that it could be boiled down to \"titus' reasoning for suspecting me is bad so titus is suspect\" - his suspicion of titus is artificial at best and is a reaction, not individually spawned.

I sure think you can. Your join date is quite recent, and the tone, especially when you say \"genuinely\" didn't rub me the right way.<br>\n2.

What I mean by this is that you begin to incorporate the other parts of the game into your reads. <br>\n4. I am nitpicking. I'm just mentioning it because it is something that I didn't like and it specifically pertained to your read on me. I was expecting from this; however, a little more.... analysis?

Ircher did not claim yet. Thinking this is scum, I'm trying to find where he found the need to make a fakeclaim and a measure of the risk and reward he gets here. If he's town, he's fully justified claiming here. If he's scum, does he include his partner in his results and risk them being lynched if he, himself is determined to be scum? How likely did he think his claim was to be believed? Why did he feel the need to fakeclaim? How do his posts reflect upon this claim, both before and after? I'm just throwing these questions out to maybe promote discussion here. This claim is really boggling me.

{"number": 3241, "id": "9311223", "user": "RayFrost", "user_id": "11994", "content": "Eh, since I'm here and procrastinating, here is the mental breakdown for my investigation targets:<br>\n<br>\nMM4 was my first target because I had a midling read on him and felt from his posting that he was not likely to be killed if town and more likely to be pushed as a mislynch - if he's scum, his most likely partners were in my mind ircher, bigyoshifan, and mortfeld. All three of these people were uncertain reads on me, so the connective results meant I'd be likely to make further reads. Additionally, MM4 seemed really easy to influence and push toward my way of thinking toward later in the game, which is favorable in that I trust my reads and having someone I can push to follow me is an advantage.<br>\n<br>\nReason to not investigate other people: I genuinely did townread gamma after the day 1 interactions, I townread the Tarkus slot, had an iffy read regarding MMM (honestly was leaning scum or hard-scum to me all game), and I felt that the other players were more likely to die if they were town (aside from bigyoshifan - it was a tossup between the two, but yoshi felt like he'd be more stubborn and less likely to sheep me if I pushed for it in a late game situation).<br>\n<br>\nN2, given the no-gun result on MM4, I was less likely to go with either of ircher / bigyoshifan due to the decreased connective read that I could get. And that day phase passed without me even really getting to be part of it. So it's back to \"who's unlikely to die\" - the lurked slot on penguinpower. There we go. Another hard to read but likely to live to endgame slot.<br>\n<br>\nN3, I actually wavered between MMM and Priscila, but in the end I decided to go with trying for as many town-confirmations as possible rather than going for a scum confirmation. I felt that I could get that lynch on MMM without many issues regardless, so there's little to no reason to have a guilty on top of it. And at this point, I'm also trying to clear out the people that I am uncertain about in their connections to the read - gamma + MMM / Priscila + MMM / Ircher + MMM were what was left. <br>\n<br>\nWith the discussion of mafia doc etc etc, I felt it was likely that if there was one on the scumteam that of any of the combinations, Ircher's claim made him the most likely to give a false innocent if he's guilty. So, I don't investigate that potential partner. With the others, it's a 50/50 between MMM or the other one giving a potential false innocent. Then, I still have a moderate townread on gamma (it's weakened but still there), so that leaves Priscila.<br>\n<br>\nThen I got ruined by mod error and mod \"compensation\" lost all motivation to play the game because of the snafu and really lost my hold on the game since I went from a position of power to a position of what is this garbage nonsense and all of the posting surrounding that was essentially a full day of white noise with no purpose.", "time": "Sun Jun 11, 2017 12:12 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=71675&start=3225", "forum": "53", "thread": "71675"}
