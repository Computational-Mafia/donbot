After that he moves to defend willow back when willow was not contributing and pretty much trolling. Right now im attucally reading GGG defence of Willow as kinda scum buddie ish, as there was no reason to defend them when they wasn't contributing and the way he did it just didn't feel right.. other than those two things (attack on confirmed town me, (at least from my POV)) and then defending someone who wasn't contributing, they have given no input to discussion other than agreeing with points other people have made. <br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: GGG</span> As they have no votes on them, I'm gonna put some heat there way, there lack of contribution and defence of someone, at the time, who had given nothing but votes with no contact, is out outrageous.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Pedit:</div> at this stage in the game, any reads are good, so though declaring it as an ealry read is good, it doesn't mean that your read will stay the same, take this post. at the start I thought Droog me and Willow was town, but by the end after looking at GGG I wasn't so sure on the latter, everything can change right now and without any REAL information to go on (confirmed infomation) we only really have suspicion gut and research to go off of.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Pedit 2:</div> Chris beat my Pedit one.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Pedit 3:</div> no not really, anyone can look up the information, and if your making a statement its your job to back it up, there is no court system that is fair that will not require evidence to convict for a reason...", "time": "Sun Nov 16, 2014 6:05 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=59806&start=225", "forum": "53", "thread": "59806"}

That dayvig thing was terrible. I actually took it as a joke post, but if that's actually meant to be a meaningful device for scum hunting, then I have zero faith in most of you.

Whomp continues to push it though as a scum tell, but I'm not sure how. Everytime I read whomp's posts, it looks like scum trying desperately to appear as if he is scum hunting, because the crap posts just continue on. I like my vote where it is.<br>\n<br>\n3.

I know that I look at the game from the perspective as the only confirmed townie, and I go from there as things progress.  Convincing others that you are town though, I agree with that part.  I don't give a shit who thinks I'm town or not, as long as I catch scum in the process.  That being said, I naturally assume everyone around me is either dense and/or scum until proven otherwise in some way (especially when I haven't played any games with them before), and I trust bad townies as much as I do scum, which is to say not at all.

If Naomi is scum, she is newscum, with convenient excuses for not being \"good at scum hunting.\"  Still though, I find Whomp to be super scummy based on how he's played and what his cases use as \"scum tells\" are.  Droog conveniently wrote off the entire first 5 pages of Whomp due to him pretending to be actually scum hunting at this point, although the fact that someone uses the usage of the word \"anyways\" as being \"forced\" or \"casual\" as a scum tell seems like the biggest tryhard scum hunting I've ever seen.  It's so fabricated that the only two options I see are either Whomp is a really bad townie or he is scum trying really hard to look like town.  There is no in-between for me here, because it's literally that bad and apparent to me.  How nobody else sees this is making me wonder. It actually makes me lean more townie for Flames due to that. The DayVig thing is almost as bad too, but we have been discussing that while ignoring Whomp.  I'm not going to let that shit slide even if the rest of you do.<br>\n<br>\nWhat I find interesting is that you do \"somewhat\" call out Whomp's weak cases Pianist (especially that \"anyways\" joke of a scum tell), but go on to ignore that and say other players are super over-reactive to it (as we all conveniently ignored the Droog freak out exchange with Whomp during RVS, as if that was just a natural thing. Please).  Then you go from that into voting Naomi due to her saying she is \"town\" over and over, although the context of it made sense to me.  I don't see that as a scum tell, but there is a possibility that she is newscum.  I just don't understand how you can ignore Whomp here and casually stroll past him.  Naomi's cases are weak, but she at least admits this.  Whomp's cases are horrible and feel completely fabricated to me, but you ignore that.  You also dislike me pairing Droog/Whomp, but give no reason why this isn't the case.  Re-read and try to find a time that Droog/Whomp weren't either fabricating some bad reaction test between each other, Droog defending/chainsawing for Whomp (and vice-versa), or them both going after the same people at the same time.  I haven't found a single instance where either one of them have had a different opinion, let alone even suspected one another.  I don't find that a town trait whatsoever, and unless Whomp is included in this Droog/Riddleton neighbor thing (and if they are, then one is definitely scum), then I see no reason for them to be so buddy-buddy.  <br>\n<br>\nCare to elaborate more thoughts on this Pianist?  You seem to be going for the easy target in Naomi, while ignoring the scum tells of other players.  You also accused every active player of being scum, while somehow saying that it is anti-town to not trust the rest of town.  Are you saying that everyone but the lurkers are scum, or are you admitting that you make shit up and flip it around for your own uses when it is convenient?  I'm just wondering here, because you went to say how scummy everyone else was (including me), but go to vote for Naomi for saying she is \"town\" a few times.", "time": "Sun Nov 16, 2014 5:04 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=59806&start=375", "forum": "53", "thread": "59806"}

I wanted to make a big post but I don't really want to do a point-by-point of the eight pages that happened since my last post, so I'll just give my general impressions here:<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Whomping Willow: </div>I'm glad that he's decided to start contributing, and his contributions have some content. That said, I don't have any particular leaning either way: I don't necessarily gather a scum vibe from him, but I haven't gotten any clear town tells from him either. My stance: Neutral. (Side note: I explicitly didn't vote for you in RVS because I dislike RVS in general; especially in this forum format where people may vote and then be away for an extended period, a person may be mistakenly lynched due to an RVS vote that would otherwise have been prevented in a different format. IGMEOY does the same thing, perhaps slightly less strongly, without the chance of mislynch). <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Originalchris:</div> My inclination here is scum. By <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6387583#p6387583\" class=\"postlink\">219</a> Willow had been posting several content posts, none of which I personally got a scum tell from. His entire case against Willow appears to be the \"scumtell of the year\" (commenting on the word \"anyway\"), and an apparent obsession with deflection, which is a convenient counter to almost any response and which can be both confusing and frustrating for the town. He also seems to be of an extremes mindset, by which I mean that if someone is accused to scum, then reasonable doubt is not enough to save, them, but rather we must go beyond a shadow of a doubt. This can be very dangerous later in the game, where a scum player can simply put a random town up for examination, and then cast doubt to create the lynch. My stance: Neutral.<br>\n<br>\nPedit: <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6389031#p6389031\" class=\"postlink\">370</a> is a great post. I don't necessarily agree with everything in it, but that he posted some more content is great, something that everyone should do, instead of posting fluff in order to look active. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">crazypianist1116: </div>Despite him asking both myself and kuror0 to post more, he has almost no posts of content. The only one I could find is <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6387135#p6387135\" class=\"postlink\">170</a>, but it is a very important post. I agree that if Munkir were not town, he would not have asked the question, though there are indeed some strange things with his post style (more on him later though). Not enough content here. My stance: Neutral.<br>\n<br>\nPedit: <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6389053#p6389053\" class=\"postlink\">373</a> is great, similar to 370 above. Again, I disagree with some of the points, but more content = good. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">istott:</div> I'd say that the most important interaction here is Riddleton's fake dayvig (actually had to look up what that was, had no clue that that even existed), his reaction to it, and his reaction to the aftermath. In my opinion, his reaction was fairly normal for a town, though a properly skilled scum player could fake it fairly easily I suppose. In order to arrive at this conclusion, we have to look at what a scum would do: <br>\n<br>\nIstott, having no knowledge of whether there was in fact a dayvig, has three options: Post a claim saying that he he's town, post a claim admitting to scum, or not posting at all and waiting to see if there was a mod announcement. <br>\n<br>\nIif he thinks there is indeed a dayvig, then:<br>\n<br>\n-Claiming town as scum does nothing; he's already dead. Claiming town as town also does nothing.<br>\n-Claiming scum as scum does nothing; he's already dead. Claiming scum as town is stupid. <br>\n-Therefore posting nothing is the only sensible response. He did not post nothing, so he must have thought that there was not a dayvig. Therefore:<br>\n<br>\n-Claiming town as scum could possibly save him. Claiming town as town could also save him.<br>\n-Claiming scum as scum would do nothing. Claiming scum as town is stupid.<br>\n-Posting nothing would lead to an accusation of dodging, although we don't know if the mod would immediately make an announcement of death, so it might lead to an examination to see if the dayvig actually existed based on mod response (or lack thereof). <br>\n<br>\nThe only conclusion that it is possible to draw is that istott did not think that there was a dayvig, but felt compelled to respond in the only logical manner, which was to claim town. This does not tell us anything about his role in and of itself, and I'm not experienced enough at reading forced tells to make a judgment on <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6387275#p6387275\" class=\"postlink\">192</a>. That said, he seems rather chilly in ISO 29-33. I don't know whether to label this as a scum trying to imitate a town keeping their emotions down, or the genuine article. Basically, my read is that I have no clear reads, however IGMEOY. My stance: Neutral.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Naomi-Tan:</div> Her biggest post by far is <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6387774#p6387774\" class=\"postlink\">245</a>, although <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6382825#p6382825\" class=\"postlink\">22</a> and <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6386982#p6386982\" class=\"postlink\">165</a> warrant consideration.<br>\n<br>\n22: I agree somewhat that acting newbish and naive in the beginning seemed like a possible smokescreen, but in my opinion she has since shown enough caution and general competence to be disavowed of that defense. I also share her views toward RVS in general, so I'm glad that she wanted to move on as soon as possible.<br>\n<br>\n165: There are lots of words here, but not much content. You say that 94 (you said 92 but meant 94) was a possibly-good, possibly-bad post, which is convenient waffling. You also state your ideas on how a point-by-point post should be structured, which doesn't really tell us anything at all. Moral of the story here is that lots of words does not mean lots of content.<br>\n<br>\n245: Another big post with very little actual content. The most important things are right at the end: She lists several negative things about originalchris, yet also states that she doesn't see him as scummy, and then proceeds to vote GGG for not talking, where her vote still stands, despite him actually posting several comments, both before and after her vote, of meaningful content. <br>\n<br>\nMy big problem with Naomi is that she tends to talk a lot but say very little. This can be detrimental in the long run, but I don't really get a scum vibe from it, either. That said, I haven't seen any town tells. My stance: Neutral.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Munkir: </div>Almost entirely no content at all. The most curious thing that I see is that in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6388698#p6388698\" class=\"postlink\">323</a>, he uses the term WIFOM. Either Naomi is giving him coaching (which I'm not particularly fond of in principle) or he's more familiar with the game than would be expected of a true newbie (in which case he has been <a href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity\" class=\"postlink\">obfuscating stupidity</a>). Either way, while I haven't seen any explicit scum tells, I'm uneasy about this player. My stance: Neutral, but IGMEOY.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">droog:</div> The first thing I have to say is that I really dislike his posting style. It reminds me of Runescape, and there's really no point to it on a forum where posts can be typed out in their entirety and be made grammatically correct. However, that doesn't really have a bearing on the game, and since he seems to be consistent with using that style over his previous games, I don't believe that there is some kind of posting restriction associated with his role.<br>\n<br>\nHis \"plan\" to prod out Riddleton as his neighbor was kind of strained and his reaction was very disproportionate. Can someone clarify to me if neighbors necessarily know the other neighbor's role? If so, then I could see a scum's attempt at a fake bus backfiring. Other than this, he's posted almost nothing of any substance. His freakout gave me a very negative vibe. My stance: Scum.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">GGG:</div> He brings up a good point about the isott-Riddleton dayvig exchange, which I hadn't considered. However, it would only be able to be staged if the scum were able to communicate outside of the thread. Is this possible? I'm not sure how the neighbor mechanic works (I had to look it up when analyzing droog above). I sort of agree with him about Riddleton bailing too easily on the fake dayvig. I don't know if it's enough to make me vote, since as I said such a ploy would only be possible if they were able to communicate, which we don't know is possible. So far, I get at least a neutral feeling, leaning toward town. My stance: Town.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">AWA:</div> obvious scum pls lynch.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">kuror0:</div> No content. I certainly understand the time problem, since I've been rather sparse myself, but with only one post so far it's very difficult to get any kind of read. My stance: Neutral.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Riddleton: </div>His dayvig test really unsettles me. It seems very forced, and he gives it up very quickly for something that is by nature only usable once per game. However, Like I said above, it's hard to see how this could be construed as scummy UNLESS he and istott were both scum, AND could have communicated outside of the thread. IGMEOY. My stance: Neutral, dependent on my views toward istott. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Flames682:</div> Just to address something that happened WAY back and has already been moved on from, I didn't IGMEOY Willow for bandwagoning GGG, but for bandwagoning Riddleton in the beginning. This sounds dumb, but I got to the bottom of the first page of posts and didn't realize that there were more pages before I replied (it's been a long time since I've post on any kind of message board). <br>\n<br>\nWhat I really don't like about him is that ISO 28-65 is all fluff, there's absolutely zero content whatsoever. In addition, his only other useful substance relates to the istott-Riddleton exchange (which I've already gone over several time); he jumps on istott for reacting in the only possible way he could have reacted (see above) and puts a vote down on top of that. Combined with his general rude and aggressive attitude and posting style, I get a negative vibe from him. Perhaps lower on my list than others, but still suspicious. My stance: Scum.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Flubbernugget: </div>First things first: Your avatar creeps me out. A lot. I would appreciate it if you would change it, but if you don't I'll live.<br>\n<br>\nIn regards to his content, there is actually very little here to go off of. The only thing is a vote on droog for his overreaction to the \"hammer\" on Riddleton (where it still stands, by the way). The vote itself is innocuous, in my opinion; less so is the fact that it still stands, without any reasonable justification, and in fact an explicit refusal to justify it. All of his other posts have been fluff. My stance: Scum. <br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\nTo sum up, I think that there are some people who lean further toward scum than others, and some people who are VERY tenuously on the fence, but who can easily fall one way or the other. For now, I think I will <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: droog</div>. His Riddleton hammer response and subsequent neighbor claim both seemed contrived. However, depending on how the next few pages of discussion go, I could easily see this vote switching to Riddleton/istott or Flubber.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#408000\"><div style=\"font-size: 80%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Tag fixed<br>\n~Mod</div></div></div>", "time": "Sun Nov 16, 2014 5:10 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=59806&start=375", "forum": "53", "thread": "59806"}

I'm just not sure which one is scum and which is the naive/bad townie. That's usually how these things go. I almost could say droog is scum and whomp is the naive one, because droog seems to sheep whomp rather than the opposite, and droog really hasn't posted anything of substance. It's mostly troll posts, which is one of the 'common' things droog and whomp first agreed upon. Ever since, droog attached to whomp, and whomp has reacted favorably to anything droog says. So I could have it backwards, but I'm strongly leaning on one of them being scum. <br>\n<br>\nAs for the rest, whomp said I didn't post anything of substance, while casually ignoring that it was my first post of the game. If we are going to judge on that, whomp should've been lynched already. He didn't post anything til page 6 beyond random votes, and yet he called me out after my first post? No, sorry.

Naomi and Riddleton.<br>\n<br>\nRiddleton whole dayvig thing was awful. pressured istott for 2 mins(real time) in which he went from having istott as scum and making the dayvig thing to call him town and having a strong read on him. Seems forced and looks to me like an attempt to look like he is scumhunting while doing actually nothing. I got to think this because when he made the claim he immediately lead istott to claim his alignment instead of looking at his plain response. when he lead him to the claim he prevented town from getting a lot of information not only from istott himself but from other people who could have joined the conversation post dayvig claim.<br>\n<br>\nNaomi has been doing lots of fence sitting, and on her posts she tends to theorize how would scum play while at the same time making it look like she has to be town then, which is not a move I'm comfortable whit. Too many post whit no content just saying she is around but won't participate in the discussion of the topic at the time. Someone said she pulled such a terrible play she must be town but i don't agree whit that. There may be a number of reasons why someone does X action but, if you make scummy actions then you should be lynched as scum because you are only harming the town whit your actions. Changing a player to town read just because his play is poor is in no way helpful for town imo.<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Riddleton</span><br>\n<br>\nok i will resume my other reads which are not as strong as the 2 I just did.<br>\n<br>\ndroog, istott and flubber are leaning scum on my reads.<br>\nGGG and AWA are leaning town.<br>\n<br>\nEveryone else is a complicated read which i have to develop some more and/or do a re read but right now I got some work to do which i couldn't do for being busy the weekend.

I know that I look at the game from the perspective as the only confirmed townie, and I go from there as things progress.  Convincing others that you are town though, I agree with that part.  I don't give a shit who thinks I'm town or not, as long as I catch scum in the process.  That being said, I naturally assume everyone around me is either dense and/or scum until proven otherwise in some way (especially when I haven't played any games with them before), and I trust bad townies as much as I do scum, which is to say not at all.  This probably makes me self-interested, since you thinking town should trust other players on Day 1 seems like the biggest fallacy ever to me, based on experience playing in both mafiascum recently, and the game of mafia in other forums for years.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nThis in no way reflects the way you tunneled BBT in 1530", "time": "Mon Nov 17, 2014 2:38 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=59806&start=450", "forum": "53", "thread": "59806"}

{"number": 492, "id": "6393287", "user": "Naomi-Tan", "user_id": "19768", "content": "So, Since my last post I been brewing, I went out to ISO people to try and find out if anyone had any suspicious activity, and I think I found a one (though by attacking them I may doom my self as i'm certain they are a better player and will do a good job convincing people to lynch me and given his disposition to attempt to attack me already once this may be a dumb idea) Now I was looking for a few Criteria.<br>\n<br>\n&gt; Lots of Vote Switching - This is scummy as train hoping, and flip-flop voting are generally a scum tatic to try and get more pressure on townies and hope the other lynch them.<br>\n&gt; Lurking - This prevents town getting a good read on them, and if combined with dense attacking posts, or posts talking about stuff that is pretty much dead and burried can lead people to thinking they are actively contributing<br>\n&gt; Content indicative of scum (High Offence, and Self Defence, not much defence of others) - Scum don't tend to defend as much as town, and instead stay on the offence as much as possible to spread malice and try to push for lynches, the more suttle put 1 or 2 good points and a vote on it and let town carry on the discussions.<br>\n<br>\nNow Observe Chart 2; <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1n42_-LmNxEg4VJyVYTd_FPtWGoDiLQxe3smBg3tAIiU/edit#gid=489973392\" class=\"postlink\">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/ ... =489973392</a> Which from this point will be locked like chart 1. <br>\nFirst I decided to examine how many times people had voted, going down in alphabetical order (as the ISO system likes to do) and when I reached crazypianist1116 I had to stop. at the time I was using Find to look for any VOTE: and so I after finding he had voted 4 times. Next thing to work out was how often did he vote, See chart 1 (Votes Over days) I put the number of times he had voted accross an axis with the number of days the game had been running and saw a VERY sharp slope, all most 1 for 1 (days to votes) this would be an indicator of 1 of 3 things;1) Uncertain town. A town who is not really sure who is scummy and who is not, kinda bumbling about and wondering around, posts by these kinds of players sound all most unsure of themselves when they vote. 2) A long RVS - They happen, can last all most 7 days in extreme cases, however that is not applicable here. 3) Scum - Scum like suttlely pushing with votes here and there, unlike the unsure town, they are all most certain to know what they are doing. and it shows, there actions tend to be high aggression looking for a weaker target, and they tend to vote for people who are easy lynches.<br>\n<br>\nSo with point 1, Lots of vote Switching, Full filled I looked at point 2, Lurking (See the unlabled pie chart) I went and put all our names and the number of times we posted down and told google, put this into a pie chart, using this we can see that He makes up 4.4% of the total posts, given the post average of 7.5356% you could say that he has just over a half of average posts per a player. that was awkwardly phrased... anyway, yeah Lurking Check.<br>\n<br>\nThen I took a look at the content See pie chart 4. <br>\n<br>\nBelow all the charts you can see my Post x Post ISO of the entirity of what he said, with little comments on anything major, but the majority of his posts have been either attacking others or Null reads, with only a single post where he talks about someone else being townish, now as a town player, you need to be looking for townish as much as Scumish, and with only 1 defence, of munkir who is pretty clueless (or was so) but even that was followed with a counter point to it (effectively balancing it to null (though i count that as 1 attack 1 defence) this was 1 of the 3 yellow posts. which are the ones I wanna talk about. As you can see, he isn't really looking for town reads or at least hasn't commented on any, which doesn't seem like a town mind set. but even with that I wasn't certain, until I reviewed the people he had voted for.<br>\n<br>\nI Know i'm confirmed town, I have a slight feeling Whomping is town, and a fair feeling that Droog is town, so by combining my feelings on his vote count, and looking at the durations of the votes the stronger the player, the less the duration of the vote, which looks less like putting votes on who they think is scummy and more like pressuing to force lynches.<br>\n<br>\nso, going back a step, to his post contents, everything don't look too bad, alot of posts are Nulls, either correcting what he said, or stating stuff that isn't one way or another. the vast majority though are pointing of things that are 'scummy' but im repeating myself moving onto the yellow posts. <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6387135#p6387135\" class=\"postlink\">post 170 the first one I've already spoken about in the paragraph two above this.</a><br>\n<br>\n[quote=\"In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6389053#p6389053\" class=\"postlink\">post 373 The second one</a> I wanted to talk about was the post where he voted for me in it at first he Talks about the Willow O Chris thing, where he tried to pair Willow and Droog, At that point in the arguement though it had cooled off and it was obvious where most people stood it would been easy to join in right then taking a side to show that you was with the town majority, Then commented on the reaction test BS basicly saying its null like me. then proceeds to attack me, claiming I say i'm town too much. which is kinda a stupid argument <br>\n<br>\nbut in the next 2 posts he tries to defend his argument pretty much backing down on the second, less than 2 posts after he made his point, this doesn't seem like he either didn't believe or care about his views..<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: crazypianist1116</span><br>\nFor full filling all 3 suspicious thingys that I said above :3<br>\nSorry about the wait, was doing alot of number games.", "time": "Tue Nov 18, 2014 9:39 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=59806&start=475", "forum": "53", "thread": "59806"}

I just think you should know this.  I don't care what your sexual preference or anything else pertaining to the real life you is or isn't, but I can say that online, you are a total tool.  I say this hoping that all the douchebags and tools of the world don't get offended by me adding you to their group. <br>\n<br>\nAs far as being controversial or edgy, neither thought ever crossed my mind.  I stated my opinion, which is that being politically correct is blatantly stupid in all regards. If someone is mentally slow (for instance), why is it morally wrong to say \"retarded?\"  The word \"retard\" was an integral part of the English language long before it ever became some sort of insult.  The same goes for the word \"gay,\" which in reality means nothing whatsoever about sexual preference.  If anything, being gay (joyful, happy, cheerful) should be a good thing.  Some random person took offense to this word though somewhere down the line, and all of a sudden it is \"morally reprehensible\" to use it.  The same goes for \"fag,\" which we've all heard is a bundle of sticks.  Again, somewhere down the line, some overly sensitive individual was literally called a \"bundle of sticks\" and took such offense that the word itself became a slur.  The real problem there lies in the first person who took such great offense to the word, rather than the idiots who attacked someone based on their sexuality.<br>\n<br>\nLet us not forget that being PC is essentially just an over-compensation for stereotypes.  That's understandable to a point, but really, it is a logical fallacy.  Just because someone takes offense to something doesn't mean it isn't also true.  Airports scan for arab/muslim individuals far closer than some white, 90-year old grandmother, but being PC would say that anyone has an equal chance to be a terrorist, and targeting arabs is racial profiling.  The issue is that while it is true that anyone can be a potential terrorist, it is far more likely that someone from a middle-eastern nation would be far more likely to be involved in an Islamic terrorist organization than the white, 90 year old grandmother from the suburbs.  If in the future, there is a large upswing of white, 90 year old grandmother terrorist groups, I'm positive that they will be targeted at airports as well.  <br>\n<br>\nAll that being said, my point is that words are words no matter what.  The INTENT of the word is what really matters, rather than what the exact word is.  You hear people call each other the N word multiple times, even though the word's root is based on slavery and oppression of African Americans, but in the modern age, people mostly use it as a term of endearment.  Should you be offended by this?  Yes/No?  Politically correctness says you should, regardless of the usage of the word.  I find this stupid.<br>\n<br>\nSo yeah, call me 'controversial and edgy' for having an opinion if you want, but I simply call it an opinion.  You bashing that opinion for no reason, assuming to know my mindset (I'm not sure why you'd ever think you would know what I'm thinking, but you aren't very good with the whole intuition thing), and assuming I would be embarrassed for stating my opinion means frankly that you are a self-centered asshole with no understanding of other people's motives, thought processes, or personalities.<br>\n<br>\nThat being said as well, you claim Flames is scummy due to you not being able to figure out his thought process.  I think you probably have trouble doing this with everyone, so it's no surprise to me if you assume anyone that thinks on different wave-lengths are scummy.  You and Droog agree on everything, so naturally you assume you both are town, but that's another fallacy which I think is based on your personality.  A lack of intuition in the game of mafia means you either go the ultra-logical statistical route (sort of like what Naomi tried), or you simply remain bad at the game due to being naturally deficient at reading people.", "time": "Wed Nov 19, 2014 12:55 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=59806&start=575", "forum": "53", "thread": "59806"}

The simple fact of the matter is that town players should try to find information that will lead to scum, and scum players will attempt to misdirect or confuse the town players so that they can't find that information. That Willow suddenly sees me as scum for the sole reason of calling out Flubber for making intentionally chaotic and confusing posts makes me very suspicious of his intentions. If you actually read my posts, while I personally disagree with his use of inflammatory language, I am MUCH more agitated at his insistence on causing general chaos and confusion, not \"leveraging the slur rigamarole\". If I was forced to say what my thought on the slur were, in the context of the game I would say that it is a carefully chosen tactic to elicit an emotional reaction out of the town, which serves to prevent the town from making cautious and rational analysis and judgment. <br>\n<br>\nAdditionally, Droog's 588 is questionable. I think Flubber is antitown, so that makes me scummy? I cannot conceive of what leap in logic you managed to make to arrive at that conclusion. <br>\n<br>\nRight now, my two highest candiatess are Flubber and Droog, Flubber for causing anti-town chaos and Droog for not only encouraging that sort of chaos, but for pointing a finger at those who call it out. Flubber's 524 is exactly the kind of misdirection and poisoning the well that I'm talking about. Also notice the buddy-buddy with Droog; I could easily see a scumbuddy relationship there.", "time": "Wed Nov 19, 2014 4:02 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=59806&start=600", "forum": "53", "thread": "59806"}

I just think you should know this.  I don't care what your sexual preference or anything else pertaining to the real life you is or isn't, but I can say that online, you are a total tool.  I say this hoping that all the douchebags and tools of the world don't get offended by me adding you to their group. <br>\n<br>\nAs far as being controversial or edgy, neither thought ever crossed my mind.  I stated my opinion, which is that being politically correct is blatantly stupid in all regards. If someone is mentally slow (for instance), why is it morally wrong to say \"retarded?\"  The word \"retard\" was an integral part of the English language long before it ever became some sort of insult.  The same goes for the word \"gay,\" which in reality means nothing whatsoever about sexual preference.  If anything, being gay (joyful, happy, cheerful) should be a good thing.  Some random person took offense to this word though somewhere down the line, and all of a sudden it is \"morally reprehensible\" to use it.  The same goes for \"fag,\" which we've all heard is a bundle of sticks.  Again, somewhere down the line, some overly sensitive individual was literally called a \"bundle of sticks\" and took such offense that the word itself became a slur.  The real problem there lies in the first person who took such great offense to the word, rather than the idiots who attacked someone based on their sexuality.<br>\n<br>\nLet us not forget that being PC is essentially just an over-compensation for stereotypes.  That's understandable to a point, but really, it is a logical fallacy.  Just because someone takes offense to something doesn't mean it isn't also true.  Airports scan for arab/muslim individuals far closer than some white, 90-year old grandmother, but being PC would say that anyone has an equal chance to be a terrorist, and targeting arabs is racial profiling.  The issue is that while it is true that anyone can be a potential terrorist, it is far more likely that someone from a middle-eastern nation would be far more likely to be involved in an Islamic terrorist organization than the white, 90 year old grandmother from the suburbs.  If in the future, there is a large upswing of white, 90 year old grandmother terrorist groups, I'm positive that they will be targeted at airports as well.  <br>\n<br>\nAll that being said, my point is that words are words no matter what.  The INTENT of the word is what really matters, rather than what the exact word is.  You hear people call each other the N word multiple times, even though the word's root is based on slavery and oppression of African Americans, but in the modern age, people mostly use it as a term of endearment.  Should you be offended by this?  Yes/No?  Politically correctness says you should, regardless of the usage of the word.  I find this stupid.<br>\n<br>\nSo yeah, call me 'controversial and edgy' for having an opinion if you want, but I simply call it an opinion.  You bashing that opinion for no reason, assuming to know my mindset (I'm not sure why you'd ever think you would know what I'm thinking, but you aren't very good with the whole intuition thing), and assuming I would be embarrassed for stating my opinion means frankly that you are a self-centered asshole with no understanding of other people's motives, thought processes, or personalities.<br>\n<br>\nThat being said as well, you claim Flames is scummy due to you not being able to figure out his thought process.  I think you probably have trouble doing this with everyone, so it's no surprise to me if you assume anyone that thinks on different wave-lengths are scummy.  You and Droog agree on everything, so naturally you assume you both are town, but that's another fallacy which I think is based on your personality.  A lack of intuition in the game of mafia means you either go the ultra-logical statistical route (sort of like what Naomi tried), or you simply remain bad at the game due to being naturally deficient at reading people.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nWell this reply is very late (as I took a 2 day unannounced break when I found myself unmotivated to talk after no one took my huge data collecting seriously) I find on the issue of PC, I don't think people should be getting so offended so easily, the off hand 'gay' statement is something 14 year old boys tend to toss around in a play ground, Taking 'offence' to it when used as a casual descriptive adjective (Not directly using it as a insult based on personal sexual prefence) It is perfectly acceptable as when someone toss's the word Nerd/Geek/Otaku around at me in personal interactions.

He has shown aggression towards a few people, but not inproportionately. Currently I trust willow as a slight town read (maybe about 15% in the town side) content seems about average so... yeah all good here. Wish I had a stronger read though..<br>\n<br>\nOriginalchris - At the start of the game, it was pretty obvious he wasn't reading our medium length posts well enough to understand them, and wasn't going back to double check his theories, and that flipp out moment, is very painful to read back over, he pretty much attacked all my town reads at the time. However, this gave me a STRONG town feeling about him, thoughing Cation to the wind and trying to attack the most active 3 players at the time was brave and bold, It showed to me as a move that only a townie would make as scum don't really have any need to attack strong town players as a lynch on a bad town is easier and less suspicious to execute. In 242 I did feel it was slightly scummy on review as it says he trusts no one, but I guess paranoid townies are a thing. So, Good Town read on them (about 61%) As including everything above, they also defended me, and as I have said many times before and will continue to do so, like a annoying funny little meme; I Know I'm Town. (why yes this is just to urk Pianist)<br>\n<br>\ncrazypianist1116 - Attacked; Me, Willow, Droog, Munkir (sort of) O Chris, and Flub (though flub deserved it) So far he has attacked around half the player base, but comes off super confident when doing so, also all his pushes look either opportunistic or anti-lurky. Much like after the first time, still think he is scum. (-50%)<br>\n<br>\nistott - Eeeh... looks townish... just boarding really... not really sure about them... got a few points... but not really getting where they are... 3% town?<br>\n<br>\nMunkir - 90% sure he is town, all the tells are there and after a rocky start, I believe he has come out unto himself lately and is making a great contribution to town. keep it up.<br>\n<br>\ndroog - While he started off good and I enjoyed my conversation, as its gone on my feelings have dropped. It was all good until he shadowed me with doubt, and I can't understand why, he said it was because I explained my thought process but how does it make me scummy...whatever, But as I contuined reading my feelings got more and more doubtful to the point that now im leaning scummy side of things (maybe a -17%) sure he is ssaying alot... but im not really getting the feeling of any active looking... just reacting to situations as they arise with no time taken for his own investigating, i'm just not really seeing any original stuff bar his attack on me which I'm biest on of course, not that I think it had a well constructed anything...<br>\n<br>\nGGG - Don't like him still, Like Droog, not much oringal content, he asks alot of questions but this IMO is only questions that make others look scummy when they try to answer, then again after our ealier fight and his reaction to my last post, I could be letting my emotions get the better of me in part, but either way my feels on GGG is; -34% ish Scummy<br>\n<br>\nAWA - AWA had a slow start but when he has posted (which is only occasionally), I find he always address's a point or gives a large wall of thoughts on players, which seems like he is doing stuff, got a good feeling about awa, +15% Townish<br>\n<br>\nkuror0 - I Don't like kuror0, lack of activity really, 6 posts across the game... 1 of which attacking me for 'fence sitting' which I don't really get, how is staying out of arguments between two people you think is town/ Arguments that are not useful for town (Ironic... I just posted a pointless response to one said argument.. I should follow my own advice..) bad for town.? in fact most every post he made has been saying something about me... personally dislike the guy now :I -40% scummy<br>\n<br>\nRiddleton - replaced out, but didn't really say much when he was in...

By <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6387583#p6387583\" class=\"postlink\">219</a> Willow had been posting several content posts, none of which I personally got a scum tell from. His entire case against Willow appears to be the \"scumtell of the year\" (commenting on the word \"anyway\"), and an apparent obsession with deflection, which is a convenient counter to almost any response and which can be both confusing and frustrating for the town. He also seems to be of an extremes mindset, by which I mean that if someone is accused to scum, then reasonable doubt is not enough to save, them, but rather we must go beyond a shadow of a doubt. This can be very dangerous later in the game, where a scum player can simply put a random town up for examination, and then cast doubt to create the lynch.

The only one I could find is <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6387135#p6387135\" class=\"postlink\">170</a>, but it is a very important post. I agree that if Munkir were not town, he would not have asked the question, though there are indeed some strange things with his post style (more on him later though). Not enough content here. My stance: Neutral.<br>\n<br>\nPedit: <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6389053#p6389053\" class=\"postlink\">373</a> is great, similar to 370 above. Again, I disagree with some of the points, but more content = good. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">istott:</div> I'd say that the most important interaction here is Riddleton's fake dayvig (actually had to look up what that was, had no clue that that even existed), his reaction to it, and his reaction to the aftermath. In my opinion, his reaction was fairly normal for a town, though a properly skilled scum player could fake it fairly easily I suppose. In order to arrive at this conclusion, we have to look at what a scum would do: <br>\n<br>\nIstott, having no knowledge of whether there was in fact a dayvig, has three options: Post a claim saying that he he's town, post a claim admitting to scum, or not posting at all and waiting to see if there was a mod announcement. <br>\n<br>\nIif he thinks there is indeed a dayvig, then:<br>\n<br>\n-Claiming town as scum does nothing; he's already dead. Claiming town as town also does nothing.<br>\n-Claiming scum as scum does nothing; he's already dead. Claiming scum as town is stupid. <br>\n-Therefore posting nothing is the only sensible response. He did not post nothing, so he must have thought that there was not a dayvig. Therefore:<br>\n<br>\n-Claiming town as scum could possibly save him. Claiming town as town could also save him.<br>\n-Claiming scum as scum would do nothing. Claiming scum as town is stupid.<br>\n-Posting nothing would lead to an accusation of dodging, although we don't know if the mod would immediately make an announcement of death, so it might lead to an examination to see if the dayvig actually existed based on mod response (or lack thereof). <br>\n<br>\nThe only conclusion that it is possible to draw is that istott did not think that there was a dayvig, but felt compelled to respond in the only logical manner, which was to claim town. This does not tell us anything about his role in and of itself, and I'm not experienced enough at reading forced tells to make a judgment on <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6387275#p6387275\" class=\"postlink\">192</a>. That said, he seems rather chilly in ISO 29-33. I don't know whether to label this as a scum trying to imitate a town keeping their emotions down, or the genuine article. Basically, my read is that I have no clear reads, however IGMEOY. My stance: Neutral.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Naomi-Tan:</div> Her biggest post by far is <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6387774#p6387774\" class=\"postlink\">245</a>, although <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6382825#p6382825\" class=\"postlink\">22</a> and <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6386982#p6386982\" class=\"postlink\">165</a> warrant consideration.<br>\n<br>\n22: I agree somewhat that acting newbish and naive in the beginning seemed like a possible smokescreen, but in my opinion she has since shown enough caution and general competence to be disavowed of that defense. I also share her views toward RVS in general, so I'm glad that she wanted to move on as soon as possible.<br>\n<br>\n165: There are lots of words here, but not much content. You say that 94 (you said 92 but meant 94) was a possibly-good, possibly-bad post, which is convenient waffling. You also state your ideas on how a point-by-point post should be structured, which doesn't really tell us anything at all. Moral of the story here is that lots of words does not mean lots of content.<br>\n<br>\n245: Another big post with very little actual content. The most important things are right at the end: She lists several negative things about originalchris, yet also states that she doesn't see him as scummy, and then proceeds to vote GGG for not talking, where her vote still stands, despite him actually posting several comments, both before and after her vote, of meaningful content. <br>\n<br>\nMy big problem with Naomi is that she tends to talk a lot but say very little. This can be detrimental in the long run, but I don't really get a scum vibe from it, either. That said, I haven't seen any town tells. My stance: Neutral.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Munkir: </div>Almost entirely no content at all. The most curious thing that I see is that in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6388698#p6388698\" class=\"postlink\">323</a>, he uses the term WIFOM. Either Naomi is giving him coaching (which I'm not particularly fond of in principle) or he's more familiar with the game than would be expected of a true newbie (in which case he has been <a href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity\" class=\"postlink\">obfuscating stupidity</a>). Either way, while I haven't seen any explicit scum tells, I'm uneasy about this player. My stance: Neutral, but IGMEOY.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">droog:</div> The first thing I have to say is that I really dislike his posting style. It reminds me of Runescape, and there's really no point to it on a forum where posts can be typed out in their entirety and be made grammatically correct. However, that doesn't really have a bearing on the game, and since he seems to be consistent with using that style over his previous games, I don't believe that there is some kind of posting restriction associated with his role.<br>\n<br>\nHis \"plan\" to prod out Riddleton as his neighbor was kind of strained and his reaction was very disproportionate. Can someone clarify to me if neighbors necessarily know the other neighbor's role? If so, then I could see a scum's attempt at a fake bus backfiring. Other than this, he's posted almost nothing of any substance. His freakout gave me a very negative vibe. My stance: Scum.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">GGG:</div> He brings up a good point about the isott-Riddleton dayvig exchange, which I hadn't considered. However, it would only be able to be staged if the scum were able to communicate outside of the thread. Is this possible? I'm not sure how the neighbor mechanic works (I had to look it up when analyzing droog above). I sort of agree with him about Riddleton bailing too easily on the fake dayvig. I don't know if it's enough to make me vote, since as I said such a ploy would only be possible if they were able to communicate, which we don't know is possible. So far, I get at least a neutral feeling, leaning toward town. My stance: Town.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">AWA:</div> obvious scum pls lynch.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">kuror0:</div> No content. I certainly understand the time problem, since I've been rather sparse myself, but with only one post so far it's very difficult to get any kind of read. My stance: Neutral.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Riddleton: </div>His dayvig test really unsettles me. It seems very forced, and he gives it up very quickly for something that is by nature only usable once per game. However, Like I said above, it's hard to see how this could be construed as scummy UNLESS he and istott were both scum, AND could have communicated outside of the thread. IGMEOY. My stance: Neutral, dependent on my views toward istott. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Flames682:</div> Just to address something that happened WAY back and has already been moved on from, I didn't IGMEOY Willow for bandwagoning GGG, but for bandwagoning Riddleton in the beginning. This sounds dumb, but I got to the bottom of the first page of posts and didn't realize that there were more pages before I replied (it's been a long time since I've post on any kind of message board). <br>\n<br>\nWhat I really don't like about him is that ISO 28-65 is all fluff, there's absolutely zero content whatsoever. In addition, his only other useful substance relates to the istott-Riddleton exchange (which I've already gone over several time); he jumps on istott for reacting in the only possible way he could have reacted (see above) and puts a vote down on top of that. Combined with his general rude and aggressive attitude and posting style, I get a negative vibe from him. Perhaps lower on my list than others, but still suspicious. My stance: Scum.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Flubbernugget: </div>First things first: Your avatar creeps me out. A lot. I would appreciate it if you would change it, but if you don't I'll live.<br>\n<br>\nIn regards to his content, there is actually very little here to go off of. The only thing is a vote on droog for his overreaction to the \"hammer\" on Riddleton (where it still stands, by the way). The vote itself is innocuous, in my opinion; less so is the fact that it still stands, without any reasonable justification, and in fact an explicit refusal to justify it. All of his other posts have been fluff. My stance: Scum. <br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\nTo sum up, I think that there are some people who lean further toward scum than others, and some people who are VERY tenuously on the fence, but who can easily fall one way or the other. For now, I think I will <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: droog</div>. His Riddleton hammer response and subsequent neighbor claim both seemed contrived.

No, at the moment I simply find his actions to be anti-town. <br>\n<br>\n2.) At the moment, droog and Willow are my two highest reads, for their insistence on misrepresenting my charges against Flubber and chainsawing anyone who comes to my defense.<br>\n<br>\nYou can be as philosophically against not making solid scum reads Day One as you want, but that will only lead you to influence your own play; my play will be dictated by my own philosophy. You may think that there are other cases where I can evaluate as scum or town; this is true, however the two cases which I mentioned above only struck me as scum <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">after</div> I made my case against Flubber. If you look at the timeline of when droog and Willow begin to make sparse cases focused on me, it's only after (and, importantly, <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">because</div>) I made my case on Flubber.<br>\n<br>\nAlso, and this tends to be a trend I've noticed with a few later posts, your comment that I could be bussing is something I'd like to address. You say that you find me scummy for pushing my case against Flubber. However, you say that if Flubber turns out to be scum, then I'm scummy for bussing. So there's literally no way to appease you here. I'm not going to dance in circles just to make you personally happy, I'm going to try to find the people I think are most detrimental to the town and get rid of them.<br>\n---<br>\nRe: GGG and Naomi's defense of me<br>\n<br>\nI'm glad that at least a few other people in this thread are able to use critical thinking and reading comprehension to actually understand what I'm trying to say. GGG's <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6402629#p6402629\" class=\"postlink\">781</a> and Naomi's <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6402525#p6402525\" class=\"postlink\">773</a> perfectly encapsulate what I was trying to say. Droog and Willow's unwillingness to read what I'm saying and connect the dots that I lay out clearly are what strike me as scummy. <br>\n---<br>\nRe: <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6403235#p6403235\" class=\"postlink\">807</a><br>\n<br>\nFor something that is supposedly \"glaringly obvious\", very few other people appear to have jumped onto that particular bandwagon. Rather, it seems to me that you are trying to plant the idea in everyone's mind that I was being opportunistic with a wagon, when in reality I was calling out Flubber's general anti-town play. <br>\n<br>\nYou seem to either be of the mindset or want to force other people into the mindset that people can only think that others players a A.) Town or B.) Scum; this kind of black-and-white mentality is both iincorrect and hazardous. People lie on a sliding scale of Town-Scum, and the fact that you apparently want me to hold up a \"neon sign with the words 'I am scumreading Flubber'\" when I do not, in fact, hold that belief is indicative that you are trying to pressure people into rushing decisions and using the same kind of \"100% good or 100% bad\" mentality that you have, or want to project as having. <br>\n<br>\nFurther, your language is leading. \"It was glaringly obvious...\". \"His attack... is pure desperation.\" You make assertions with strong language to attempt to influence other people into whatever agenda you want to push; I'm reminded of both politicians and lawyers, neither of whom I tend to trust. That you tend to use this kind of assertive language without first constructing an argument, forcing the reader to either search through the thread and construct the argument themselves (doing your work for you) or blindly believe you is something that I find to be detrimental to players who would be particularly susceptible to that kind of suggestion. <br>\n---<br>\nRe: <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6402090#p6402090\" class=\"postlink\">748</a><br>\nHoly shit you're like a dog with a bone with this fucking post. If this is your only cause for voting for me then that's sad. How about you stop spinning what I say into whatever agenda you want to push instead of looking at what I'm saying and doing your homework.<br>\n<br>\nWhen I said in 648 that I had already explained, I was referring back to <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6397075#p6397075\" class=\"postlink\">603</a> where I make my initial explanations of why I'm against Flubber. In 648 I elaborated specifically upon the posts you asked for. Your entire argument here appears to be that I was inconsistent with my chain of events, but in reality you didn't bother to do your homework and even attempt to make the some connections I made, you simply saw what might be construed as a fallacy and jumped on it, and haven't let go since.<br>\n---<br>\nRe: <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6403578#p6403578\" class=\"postlink\">812</a><br>\n<br>\n...what? Munkir your play is inconsistent. In <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6399366#p6399366\" class=\"postlink\">656</a> you ask me specific questions. I answer them in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6400592#p6400592\" class=\"postlink\">683</a>, but you don't acknowledge this. In <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6402078#p6402078\" class=\"postlink\">742</a>, you say that you see my point of view, and in fact imply that you are leaning toward voting in my favor. Now in 812 you suddenly pull a complete 180, and join the wagon against me and pile a vote on for good measure. You say you were leaning more and more toward me being scum, but you don't say where or why. You say that if I were scum then I would have dropped my case on Flubber to save face, but then you say that since other people seem to think that since I didn't drop my case, that makes me scummy too (even though you admit that you wouldn't necessarily think that on your own; perhaps droog and Willow's leading diction is working by influencing the though processes of a newer player?). This is like with CP above; I'm damned if I do, damned if I don't, and I'm not going to do that dance for you, I'm going to go after the people I think will hurt the town. You then bring up 801 for some reason, saying that it was a \"cave\" and that you think it is basically an OMGUS vote. First of all, I didn't \"cave\", I was out (real life exists, what do you know), I had had a moment to check on the game, and wanted to drop in a few corrections. Secondly, unless you <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">also</div> haven't been reading what I've been posting, my vote on droog is <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">not</div> an OMGUS, which is characterized by voting for a person for the sole reason that they are voting for you, but rather a vote based on his insistence on misrepresenting my posts in order to push his agenda (seemingly to wagon me, although it has the added effect of protecting Flubber; I still see a buddy-buddy there). Overall, I don't necessarily think you're scum, but I think that you are dangerously naive at some of the ore complex situations that can arise from this game, and I think that you could be easily manipulated by the true scum. I'll be keeping a careful watch on you.<br>\n---<br>\nRe: <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6403599#p6403599\" class=\"postlink\">814</a><br>\n<br>\nI agree completely; Flubber, as I have noted several times, hasn't actually posted any real content, preferring rather to poke and prod and make other people post content for him, while seeming to look like he's contributing. Droog and Willow's attack on me has had the serendipitous side effect of reducing the pressure on Flubber; more evidence of a buddying.<br>\n---<br>\nRe:<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6403639#p6403639\" class=\"postlink\">818</a><br>\n<br>\nWhat? You don't find Flubber town; I don't find Flubber town. Yet you attack me because I decided to actually push in that direction? Your play is inconsistent, which is something I guess I should expect from a self-admitted troll account.<br>\n---<br>\nRe <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6403810#p6403810\" class=\"postlink\">820</a><br>\n<br>\nShe's actually not. The characteristic of a chainsaw defense is that it is attacking an attacker solely because the initial attacker is attacking a different person (i.e. A is attacking B, so C attacks A). This is seemingly, but <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">not</div> similar to the situation where a person is attacking a different person, and then another person finds flaws in that person's arguments and decides to attack them (i.e. A is attacking B, but C notices issues with A's arguments, so C attacks A). While the end result is similar, the motives are different. Be careful not to fall victim to the fundamental attribution error. <br>\n---<br>\nRe: <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6404216#p6404216\" class=\"postlink\">825</a><br>\n<br>\nBringing up a player's meta is not indicative of anything. In this game, and this game alone, it is possible to analyze Flubber's ISO and discover that his posts do not tend to have any significant substance. Again you refuse to actually do any real work, preferring instead for other people to make your connections for you. Maybe instead of telling us to find examples where he doesn't post content, you can provide examples where he does post content? That would be more constructive.<br>\n---<br>\nRe<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6404391#p6404391\" class=\"postlink\">828</a><br>\n<br>\nThis is a classic example, of which many more can be found in Flubber's ISO. He doesn't actually say anything himself, he just pokes another player to make a claim or answer a question, while he himself sits in the background and looks busy.<br>\n---<br>\nRe: <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6404422#p6404422\" class=\"postlink\">833</a><br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Generic defenses/hand waves are scummy. </div></blockquote> <br>\n<br>\nOh really?

Again we have leading diction which will lead less experienced players to believe that only one perspective exists, and that perspective is coincidentally perfectly aligned with the agenda that I should be lynched. It is my opinion, as I have stated many times, that policy lynches are a tool that can and should be used when thinking in the long-term, since they will, over the course of the game, produce a healthier environment for finding and lynching scum.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div> And your ate over being scum read reeks the same scum stench of CP.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nFirst of all, \"ate\"?

This to means showed that you cared more about town itself rather than keeping your own hide alive viva being friends. But in post 801 you abandoned your quarry meaning that all that pressure and work was for a whole another reason other than town preservation. I feel as though your pursuit in ridding town of Flubber wasn't a bad one but your abandonment of the pursuit was.<br>\n<br>\n3- You voted Droog and while i have been keeping my eye on him I don't particularly see any the major flags that you attempted to point out so my only logical conclusion is your ether mad at him so you voted or are scum and trying to rid yourself of a problem.

Naomi does a fine job of breaking it down, why don't you look at her post? <br>\n<br>\nTo address the second paragraph, what you're saying is that you would only not consider me scum if I pushed and pushed and pushed on Flubber until he or I was dead.

This has come up twice now, leading me to believe that it's a strong part of your mental case against me. Kindly strike that, as it is an analytical leap made purely on your end that has no basis in reality. <br>\n<br>\nThe only way that I could have played droog in the manner that you suggest is if I thought that he would react precisely the way that he did. Is it not clear from my responses to his posts that not only did I not expect that, but that I abhor that kind of posting in general? This point, as you admit, is very weak, and incredibly convoluted. At this point you're reaching for reasons to vote for me. You also seem to not take any notice of the hive mind that droog and Willow are planting against me. Or perhaps is this all Naomi's plot, since she can attack droog for attacking me for attacking Flubber? Maybe Originalchris will come out of the woodwork and attack Naomi for attacking droog for attacking me for attacking Flubber.

He proceeds to say this <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">and only this</div> in his case against me, even though I respond to it many times.

To me, policy lynches occur AFTER there are no solid scum candidates. To answer your question directly, yes, you would be my next policy lynch after Flubber, IF I DID NOT HAVE ANY SCUMREADS. I currently have a strong scumread (droog) and a light scumread (Willow). That is why I am voting for droog, and not Flubber, and not you. And for the record, as you seem to be unclear about this, I am not suspicious of you because I turned against you (that is OMGUS). I am wary of you because you have faulty thinking regarding the mechanics of this game, and you seem to be easily suggested by the leading questions and directives of the people that I suspect to be scum (droog and Willow).

You want me to post something that beyond a shadow of a doubt vindicates me from your personal schema of justice. That's impossible, because A.) If you are scum and know that I am town you can arbitrarily move the goalposts, or B.) If you are town, and legitimately think I am scum, you can arbitrarily move the goalposts. The only way for me to meet your demands is for you to be town and think I am town, in which case you wouldn't be grilling me at all. <br>\n<br>\nDo I know for a fact that droog is scum? No. I won't know for a fact that droog is scum until we lynch him and he flips scum. However, my read on him is scum, and more relevantly, more scum than Flubber, who I believe to be simply behaving in an anti-town manner (although I could shift my perspective and see him as scum). Droog's insistence on pushing a weak case that has already been addressed as wrong (several times by several different players), coupled with him chainsaw defense of Flubber, is what leads me to think he is scum.<br>\n<br>\nRegarding your grand \"Flag 4\" plot, you have an image in your head of some convoluted scheme, and you're only looking at \"evidence\" which supports your theory. This is called confirmation bias, and it's a bad thing. That you readily admit that it will need \"all the evidence it can get\" is a gold mine for scum, because they will just feed you whatever you want to hear in order to solidify your mental image. Instead of trying to cram all of the evidence into an admittedly unnecessarily complex and unrealistic scheme, try to look at the evidence FIRST and come to the conclusion AFTER. Relevant logical fallacies are affirming the consequent (you think this \"Flag 4\" is the truth, so therefore whatever needed to happen for it to be true must have happened) and fallacy of the single cause (\"Flag 4\" is the only possible explanation).", "time": "Sun Nov 23, 2014 7:12 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=59806&start=850", "forum": "53", "thread": "59806"}

There is definitely some kind of buddy relationship between him and Flubber, no matter how much Flubber tried to distance himself. <br>\n<br>\nFlubber: Very clear OMGUS vote on me, he didn't really post any kind of case against me (as is usual with his posts) other than 833 which I've already addressed and am waiting for a response (he's posted other responses since 842, so I'm curious as to why he hasn't responded to my direct response to his entire \"case\"). His trend in posting is very backseat-driver-ish; I don't like how he can just get away with posting tons of fluff and no content, ever, but still look like an active player. If Flubber would do even one wallpost stating his analysis of every player, that would be more useful to the town than the entirety of his posts to date.

His apparent case that my attack on Flubber was opportunistic has been addressed by myself several times (once AGAIN for those in the audience, Flubber's general posting style is detrimental to a healthy atmosphere of scumhunting, and in lieu of any strong scumreads, I was pressuring Flubber). His early \"scumread\" of me for not voting him in RVS is so absurd that it hardly bears mentioning, but it conveniently sets him for \"having already had suspicions about me\" (air quote there, I'm not saying you actually said that /preempting the misrep). After that he just hops onto droog's train AND has the gall to accuse me of misrep (himself misrepping me). He then proceeds to call my attack on droog \"pure desperation\", when someone who didn't have an agenda (GGG) could reach the conclusion that it was a genuine frustrated reaction. His sudden buddying up to droog, overlooking his misreps that other players have seemed to be able to see without any significant problems, and attacking me without being able to put up a case that stands to cross-examination are my suspicions for scum.<br>\n<br>\nMunkir: I don't really know what to think about this guy.

You can't simply wave off every accusation as chainsawing, at some point everyone is going to be attacking someone else, does that make them immune to accusations because their attacker is simply chainsawing? No, you have to look at the specific behaviors and motivators behind the attack. <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>In terms of the whole Flubber bus thing, I pointed that out in the event that Flubber flips scum. My read on your argument was totally independent of that.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nMy problem with this is that if Flubber flips scum, and I was right, then you will automatically suspect me for bussing. However, if he flips town, and I was wrong, then you will automatically suspect me for pushing onto someone who turned out to be town, AND we will have lost a townie.

I know that I look at the game from the perspective as the only confirmed townie, and I go from there as things progress.  Convincing others that you are town though, I agree with that part.  I don't give a shit who thinks I'm town or not, as long as I catch scum in the process.  That being said, I naturally assume everyone around me is either dense and/or scum until proven otherwise in some way (especially when I haven't played any games with them before), and I trust bad townies as much as I do scum, which is to say not at all.

That said, I don't have any particular leaning either way: I don't necessarily gather a scum vibe from him, but I haven't gotten any clear town tells from him either. My stance: Neutral. (Side note: I explicitly didn't vote for you in RVS because I dislike RVS in general; especially in this forum format where people may vote and then be away for an extended period, a person may be mistakenly lynched due to an RVS vote that would otherwise have been prevented in a different format. IGMEOY does the same thing, perhaps slightly less strongly, without the chance of mislynch). <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Originalchris:</div> My inclination here is scum. By <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6387583#p6387583\" class=\"postlink\">219</a> Willow had been posting several content posts, none of which I personally got a scum tell from. His entire case against Willow appears to be the \"scumtell of the year\" (commenting on the word \"anyway\"), and an apparent obsession with deflection, which is a convenient counter to almost any response and which can be both confusing and frustrating for the town. He also seems to be of an extremes mindset, by which I mean that if someone is accused to scum, then reasonable doubt is not enough to save, them, but rather we must go beyond a shadow of a doubt. This can be very dangerous later in the game, where a scum player can simply put a random town up for examination, and then cast doubt to create the lynch. My stance: Neutral.<br>\n<br>\nPedit: <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6389031#p6389031\" class=\"postlink\">370</a> is a great post. I don't necessarily agree with everything in it, but that he posted some more content is great, something that everyone should do, instead of posting fluff in order to look active. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">crazypianist1116: </div>Despite him asking both myself and kuror0 to post more, he has almost no posts of content. The only one I could find is <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6387135#p6387135\" class=\"postlink\">170</a>, but it is a very important post. I agree that if Munkir were not town, he would not have asked the question, though there are indeed some strange things with his post style (more on him later though). Not enough content here. My stance: Neutral.<br>\n<br>\nPedit: <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6389053#p6389053\" class=\"postlink\">373</a> is great, similar to 370 above. Again, I disagree with some of the points, but more content = good. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">istott:</div> I'd say that the most important interaction here is Riddleton's fake dayvig (actually had to look up what that was, had no clue that that even existed), his reaction to it, and his reaction to the aftermath. In my opinion, his reaction was fairly normal for a town, though a properly skilled scum player could fake it fairly easily I suppose. In order to arrive at this conclusion, we have to look at what a scum would do: <br>\n<br>\nIstott, having no knowledge of whether there was in fact a dayvig, has three options: Post a claim saying that he he's town, post a claim admitting to scum, or not posting at all and waiting to see if there was a mod announcement. <br>\n<br>\nIif he thinks there is indeed a dayvig, then:<br>\n<br>\n-Claiming town as scum does nothing; he's already dead. Claiming town as town also does nothing.<br>\n-Claiming scum as scum does nothing; he's already dead. Claiming scum as town is stupid. <br>\n-Therefore posting nothing is the only sensible response. He did not post nothing, so he must have thought that there was not a dayvig. Therefore:<br>\n<br>\n-Claiming town as scum could possibly save him. Claiming town as town could also save him.<br>\n-Claiming scum as scum would do nothing. Claiming scum as town is stupid.<br>\n-Posting nothing would lead to an accusation of dodging, although we don't know if the mod would immediately make an announcement of death, so it might lead to an examination to see if the dayvig actually existed based on mod response (or lack thereof). <br>\n<br>\nThe only conclusion that it is possible to draw is that istott did not think that there was a dayvig, but felt compelled to respond in the only logical manner, which was to claim town. This does not tell us anything about his role in and of itself, and I'm not experienced enough at reading forced tells to make a judgment on <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6387275#p6387275\" class=\"postlink\">192</a>. That said, he seems rather chilly in ISO 29-33. I don't know whether to label this as a scum trying to imitate a town keeping their emotions down, or the genuine article. Basically, my read is that I have no clear reads, however IGMEOY. My stance: Neutral.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Naomi-Tan:</div> Her biggest post by far is <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6387774#p6387774\" class=\"postlink\">245</a>, although <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6382825#p6382825\" class=\"postlink\">22</a> and <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6386982#p6386982\" class=\"postlink\">165</a> warrant consideration.<br>\n<br>\n22: I agree somewhat that acting newbish and naive in the beginning seemed like a possible smokescreen, but in my opinion she has since shown enough caution and general competence to be disavowed of that defense. I also share her views toward RVS in general, so I'm glad that she wanted to move on as soon as possible.<br>\n<br>\n165: There are lots of words here, but not much content. You say that 94 (you said 92 but meant 94) was a possibly-good, possibly-bad post, which is convenient waffling. You also state your ideas on how a point-by-point post should be structured, which doesn't really tell us anything at all. Moral of the story here is that lots of words does not mean lots of content.<br>\n<br>\n245: Another big post with very little actual content. The most important things are right at the end: She lists several negative things about originalchris, yet also states that she doesn't see him as scummy, and then proceeds to vote GGG for not talking, where her vote still stands, despite him actually posting several comments, both before and after her vote, of meaningful content. <br>\n<br>\nMy big problem with Naomi is that she tends to talk a lot but say very little. This can be detrimental in the long run, but I don't really get a scum vibe from it, either. That said, I haven't seen any town tells. My stance: Neutral.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Munkir: </div>Almost entirely no content at all. The most curious thing that I see is that in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6388698#p6388698\" class=\"postlink\">323</a>, he uses the term WIFOM. Either Naomi is giving him coaching (which I'm not particularly fond of in principle) or he's more familiar with the game than would be expected of a true newbie (in which case he has been <a href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity\" class=\"postlink\">obfuscating stupidity</a>). Either way, while I haven't seen any explicit scum tells, I'm uneasy about this player. My stance: Neutral, but IGMEOY.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">droog:</div> The first thing I have to say is that I really dislike his posting style. It reminds me of Runescape, and there's really no point to it on a forum where posts can be typed out in their entirety and be made grammatically correct. However, that doesn't really have a bearing on the game, and since he seems to be consistent with using that style over his previous games, I don't believe that there is some kind of posting restriction associated with his role.<br>\n<br>\nHis \"plan\" to prod out Riddleton as his neighbor was kind of strained and his reaction was very disproportionate. Can someone clarify to me if neighbors necessarily know the other neighbor's role? If so, then I could see a scum's attempt at a fake bus backfiring. Other than this, he's posted almost nothing of any substance. His freakout gave me a very negative vibe. My stance: Scum.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">GGG:</div> He brings up a good point about the isott-Riddleton dayvig exchange, which I hadn't considered. However, it would only be able to be staged if the scum were able to communicate outside of the thread. Is this possible? I'm not sure how the neighbor mechanic works (I had to look it up when analyzing droog above). I sort of agree with him about Riddleton bailing too easily on the fake dayvig. I don't know if it's enough to make me vote, since as I said such a ploy would only be possible if they were able to communicate, which we don't know is possible. So far, I get at least a neutral feeling, leaning toward town. My stance: Town.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">AWA:</div> obvious scum pls lynch.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">kuror0:</div> No content. I certainly understand the time problem, since I've been rather sparse myself, but with only one post so far it's very difficult to get any kind of read. My stance: Neutral.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Riddleton: </div>His dayvig test really unsettles me. It seems very forced, and he gives it up very quickly for something that is by nature only usable once per game. However, Like I said above, it's hard to see how this could be construed as scummy UNLESS he and istott were both scum, AND could have communicated outside of the thread. IGMEOY. My stance: Neutral, dependent on my views toward istott. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Flames682:</div> Just to address something that happened WAY back and has already been moved on from, I didn't IGMEOY Willow for bandwagoning GGG, but for bandwagoning Riddleton in the beginning. This sounds dumb, but I got to the bottom of the first page of posts and didn't realize that there were more pages before I replied (it's been a long time since I've post on any kind of message board). <br>\n<br>\nWhat I really don't like about him is that ISO 28-65 is all fluff, there's absolutely zero content whatsoever. In addition, his only other useful substance relates to the istott-Riddleton exchange (which I've already gone over several time); he jumps on istott for reacting in the only possible way he could have reacted (see above) and puts a vote down on top of that. Combined with his general rude and aggressive attitude and posting style, I get a negative vibe from him. Perhaps lower on my list than others, but still suspicious. My stance: Scum.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Flubbernugget: </div>First things first: Your avatar creeps me out. A lot. I would appreciate it if you would change it, but if you don't I'll live.<br>\n<br>\nIn regards to his content, there is actually very little here to go off of. The only thing is a vote on droog for his overreaction to the \"hammer\" on Riddleton (where it still stands, by the way). The vote itself is innocuous, in my opinion; less so is the fact that it still stands, without any reasonable justification, and in fact an explicit refusal to justify it. All of his other posts have been fluff. My stance: Scum. <br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\nTo sum up, I think that there are some people who lean further toward scum than others, and some people who are VERY tenuously on the fence, but who can easily fall one way or the other. For now, I think I will <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: droog</div>. His Riddleton hammer response and subsequent neighbor claim both seemed contrived. However, depending on how the next few pages of discussion go, I could easily see this vote switching to Riddleton/istott or Flubber.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#408000\"><div style=\"font-size: 80%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Tag fixed<br>\n~Mod</div></div></div></div></blockquote></div></div></div><br>\nI could see myself ending up on this.

As of 842, the only thing you have consistently said is that since I \"said\" (remember that I never actually said this) that \"Flubber is anti-town, and therefore scum\" then it follows that I am scum. Not only did you not convince me, but I specifically addressed your case. It is you who have chosen to dismiss my refutation out of hand. <br>\n<br>\nSecond paragraph: Never have I discouraged anyone from posting. Show me where I say \"X, don't post.\" Rather, I am trying to get everyone to use critical thinking, not saying that only the people who have displayed it until this point are allowed to post. Once again, you read into my words just enough to be able to twist them into a very narrow interpretation where I am scummy. Also, saying that my walls shut down discussion is fallacious; I can post whatever I want in whatever format I want, the onus is on everyone else to read it.

In fact, THAT WAS THE WHOLE REASON I WAS VOTING FOR HIM IN THE FIRST PLACE. No more, no less. Somehow, you made the jump from \"AWA thinks Flubber is anti-town\" to \"AWA thinks anti-town = scum, AWA thinks Flubber is anti-town, AWA thinks Flubber is scum, therefore AWA must be scum.\" <br>\n<br>\nAddressing the \"chain of events\" argument: You seem to be of the mindset that if I hadn't explained my vote, you wouldn't have thought I was suspicious. Alternatively, if I had placed my vote earlier in the sequence, then I wouldn't be suspicious. However, if you aren't aware of it by now, or if you haven't gone through my meta, <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">I never place a vote without an explanation.</div> Also, your point that none of the other three people presented themselves as pro-town is irrelevant; I ALSO did not present myself as pro-town, any more than GGG did for saying he was okay with a policy lynch. I note that you are conspicuously NOT going after GGG at any point. To continue with that vein, I did not directly call Flubber anti-town, I said that his behavior may become anti-town in the future if he continued to stir up emotional responses. I specifically said that he would be \"nonproductive\" (not anti-town) at best, and \"anti-town at worst\". That you automatically assume that I only cared for the worst possible outcome is saying something about your own mentality. <br>\n<br>\nYour insistence that my trait of providing an explanation whenever I take an action is somehow scummy is perplexing. It implies that if I were to not provide an explanation, then you would find me not scummy. In what way does less logic and reasoning help the town? <br>\n<br>\n\"the other opinions were made for the sake of the people speaking<br>\nyours was for the people listening\"<br>\n<br>\nSo if I were to speak for the sake of speaking, while not caring at all about why I was saying what I was saying, that would be perfectly acceptable to you. I call this absolute hogwash. Behaving without thought or reason does nothing except add an element of unpredictability to people's reads, which ultimately serves to help the scum hide in the confusion.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>droog wrote:</cite><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>You seem to either be of the mindset or want to force other people into the mindset that people can only think that others players a A.)

However, he conveniently ignores the possibility that <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">I did not think that Flubber was guaranteed scum.</div> When I say that Willow didn't have the capacity to understand the sliding scale, it was in response to the apparent fact that he couldn't understand that I could possibly believe that Flubber was acting anti-town without being outright scum.

I'm not trying to convince Willow of anything regarding Willow himself, that would be stupid. I'm trying to convince the people whose opinion I can actually influence (i.e. everyone else) by pointing out Willow's manipulative language. <br>\n<br>\nThe last three lines of this section are a not-so-subtly veiled jab at my posting style.

Quite a bold statement, when you can't even take the time to read my posts with any kind of critical thinking.<br>\n<br>\nYou say that 603 was solely in response to 588. That is incorrect and yet another example of you taking whatever flimsy connection you can find that supports your already-confirmed-in-your-head conclusion and hanging on to it until it's beaten to death. The ONLY PART of 603 that was in response to 588 was the second paragraph. If you look at the points in question that I addressed (in post 645, the first selfquote), the primary accusation is that I capitalized on the \"gay\" nonsense in order to start a wagon of opportunity. If you read the first paragraph of 603, you will find that I address this accusation: Flubber's incitement of players who had already been demonstrated to be vulnerable to emotional appeals was an intentionally chaotic and confusing post, and I felt that that sort of behavior warranted a policy lynch. Your carefully chosen \"snipping\" of my post illustrates exactly how you cherrypick which parts of my posts to focus on, instead of taking all of the information I give and all of the analysis that I provide, and from there construct a strawman that is easy for you to burn down. <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>droog wrote:</cite>for those playing at home<br>\ni will summarize this in my next post<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>What?

Great. I don't like the way you pushed on me. Is that grounds enough for a lynch? I don't like the way Willow pushed on me. Is that grounds for a lynch? The difference between the way I pushed on Flubber and the way you and Willow pushed on me is that I published a large quantity of information and analysis, and you two posted primarily cherrypicked strawmen of my arguments. <br>\n<br>\nI never said that Willow should townread me, I was asking why Willow decided to scumread me for going after a person who we each felt was anti-town. If you are correct and Willow was going after me for my methodology instead of my attack in principle, then I can only agree with that. However, I find Willow's methodology also lacking. <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>droog wrote:</cite><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Bringing up a player's meta is not indicative of anything.

I do expect however that you at least entertain my perspectives when I give massive amounts of information and analysis.<br>\n<br>\nRegarding meta, it's hypocritical that you took the time to go through Flubber's history to find that he's being \"town-consistent\" (which doesn't mean anything, a player can easily go against their own meta) but you won't go through my meta to find that I always post in a verbose, logical manner, even though that's apparently a scumread in this game. <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>droog wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6404794#p6404794\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6404794#p6404794\" data-post-id=\"6404794\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 855</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10346\">AWA</a> wrote:</cite><br>\nIf you can't see that droog is purposefully being obstinate regarding my repeated clarifications about why I pressured Flubber, then I can't help you, because I'm not going to cater to three people now (droog, Willow, and you) who either can't or refuse to see what I'm saying, even after multiple clarifications.

(Side note: I explicitly didn't vote for you in RVS because I dislike RVS in general; especially in this forum format where people may vote and then be away for an extended period, a person may be mistakenly lynched due to an RVS vote that would otherwise have been prevented in a different format.

By <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6387583#p6387583\" class=\"postlink\">219</a> Willow had been posting several content posts, none of which I personally got a scum tell from. His entire case against Willow appears to be the \"scumtell of the year\" (commenting on the word \"anyway\"), and an apparent obsession with deflection, which is a convenient counter to almost any response and which can be both confusing and frustrating for the town. He also seems to be of an extremes mindset, by which I mean that if someone is accused to scum, then reasonable doubt is not enough to save, them, but rather we must go beyond a shadow of a doubt. This can be very dangerous later in the game, where a scum player can simply put a random town up for examination, and then cast doubt to create the lynch.

The only one I could find is <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6387135#p6387135\" class=\"postlink\">170</a>, but it is a very important post. I agree that if Munkir were not town, he would not have asked the question, though there are indeed some strange things with his post style (more on him later though). Not enough content here.

Again, I disagree with some of the points, but more content = good. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">istott:</div> I'd say that the most important interaction here is Riddleton's fake dayvig (actually had to look up what that was, had no clue that that even existed), his reaction to it, and his reaction to the aftermath. In my opinion, his reaction was fairly normal for a town, though a properly skilled scum player could fake it fairly easily I suppose. In order to arrive at this conclusion, we have to look at what a scum would do: <br>\n<br>\nIstott, having no knowledge of whether there was in fact a dayvig, has three options: Post a claim saying that he he's town, post a claim admitting to scum, or not posting at all and waiting to see if there was a mod announcement. <br>\n<br>\nIif he thinks there is indeed a dayvig, then:<br>\n<br>\n-Claiming town as scum does nothing; he's already dead. Claiming town as town also does nothing.<br>\n-Claiming scum as scum does nothing; he's already dead. Claiming scum as town is stupid. <br>\n-Therefore posting nothing is the only sensible response. He did not post nothing, so he must have thought that there was not a dayvig. Therefore:<br>\n<br>\n-Claiming town as scum could possibly save him. Claiming town as town could also save him.<br>\n-Claiming scum as scum would do nothing. Claiming scum as town is stupid.<br>\n-Posting nothing would lead to an accusation of dodging, although we don't know if the mod would immediately make an announcement of death, so it might lead to an examination to see if the dayvig actually existed based on mod response (or lack thereof). <br>\n<br>\nThe only conclusion that it is possible to draw is that istott did not think that there was a dayvig, but felt compelled to respond in the only logical manner, which was to claim town. This does not tell us anything about his role in and of itself, and I'm not experienced enough at reading forced tells to make a judgment on <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6387275#p6387275\" class=\"postlink\">192</a>. That said, he seems rather chilly in ISO 29-33. I don't know whether to label this as a scum trying to imitate a town keeping their emotions down, or the genuine article. Basically, my read is that I have no clear reads, however IGMEOY. My stance: Neutral.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Naomi-Tan:</div> Her biggest post by far is <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6387774#p6387774\" class=\"postlink\">245</a>, although <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6382825#p6382825\" class=\"postlink\">22</a> and <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6386982#p6386982\" class=\"postlink\">165</a> warrant consideration.<br>\n<br>\n22: I agree somewhat that acting newbish and naive in the beginning seemed like a possible smokescreen, but in my opinion she has since shown enough caution and general competence to be disavowed of that defense. I also share her views toward RVS in general, so I'm glad that she wanted to move on as soon as possible.<br>\n<br>\n165: There are lots of words here, but not much content. You say that 94 (you said 92 but meant 94) was a possibly-good, possibly-bad post, which is convenient waffling. You also state your ideas on how a point-by-point post should be structured, which doesn't really tell us anything at all. Moral of the story here is that lots of words does not mean lots of content.<br>\n<br>\n245: Another big post with very little actual content. The most important things are right at the end: She lists several negative things about originalchris, yet also states that she doesn't see him as scummy, and then proceeds to vote GGG for not talking, where her vote still stands, despite him actually posting several comments, both before and after her vote, of meaningful content. <br>\n<br>\nMy big problem with Naomi is that she tends to talk a lot but say very little. This can be detrimental in the long run, but I don't really get a scum vibe from it, either. That said, I haven't seen any town tells. My stance: Neutral.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Munkir: </div>Almost entirely no content at all. The most curious thing that I see is that in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6388698#p6388698\" class=\"postlink\">323</a>, he uses the term WIFOM. Either Naomi is giving him coaching (which I'm not particularly fond of in principle) or he's more familiar with the game than would be expected of a true newbie (in which case he has been <a href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity\" class=\"postlink\">obfuscating stupidity</a>). Either way, while I haven't seen any explicit scum tells, I'm uneasy about this player. My stance: Neutral, but IGMEOY.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">droog:</div> The first thing I have to say is that I really dislike his posting style. It reminds me of Runescape, and there's really no point to it on a forum where posts can be typed out in their entirety and be made grammatically correct. However, that doesn't really have a bearing on the game, and since he seems to be consistent with using that style over his previous games, I don't believe that there is some kind of posting restriction associated with his role.<br>\n<br>\nHis \"plan\" to prod out Riddleton as his neighbor was kind of strained and his reaction was very disproportionate. Can someone clarify to me if neighbors necessarily know the other neighbor's role? If so, then I could see a scum's attempt at a fake bus backfiring. Other than this, he's posted almost nothing of any substance. His freakout gave me a very negative vibe. My stance: Scum.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">GGG:</div> He brings up a good point about the isott-Riddleton dayvig exchange, which I hadn't considered. However, it would only be able to be staged if the scum were able to communicate outside of the thread. Is this possible? I'm not sure how the neighbor mechanic works (I had to look it up when analyzing droog above). I sort of agree with him about Riddleton bailing too easily on the fake dayvig. I don't know if it's enough to make me vote, since as I said such a ploy would only be possible if they were able to communicate, which we don't know is possible. So far, I get at least a neutral feeling, leaning toward town. My stance: Town.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">AWA:</div> obvious scum pls lynch.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">kuror0:</div> No content. I certainly understand the time problem, since I've been rather sparse myself, but with only one post so far it's very difficult to get any kind of read. My stance: Neutral.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Riddleton: </div>His dayvig test really unsettles me. It seems very forced, and he gives it up very quickly for something that is by nature only usable once per game. However, Like I said above, it's hard to see how this could be construed as scummy UNLESS he and istott were both scum, AND could have communicated outside of the thread. IGMEOY. My stance: Neutral, dependent on my views toward istott. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Flames682:</div> Just to address something that happened WAY back and has already been moved on from, I didn't IGMEOY Willow for bandwagoning GGG, but for bandwagoning Riddleton in the beginning. This sounds dumb, but I got to the bottom of the first page of posts and didn't realize that there were more pages before I replied (it's been a long time since I've post on any kind of message board). <br>\n<br>\nWhat I really don't like about him is that ISO 28-65 is all fluff, there's absolutely zero content whatsoever. In addition, his only other useful substance relates to the istott-Riddleton exchange (which I've already gone over several time); he jumps on istott for reacting in the only possible way he could have reacted (see above) and puts a vote down on top of that. Combined with his general rude and aggressive attitude and posting style, I get a negative vibe from him. Perhaps lower on my list than others, but still suspicious. My stance: Scum.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Flubbernugget: </div>First things first: Your avatar creeps me out. A lot. I would appreciate it if you would change it, but if you don't I'll live.<br>\n<br>\nIn regards to his content, there is actually very little here to go off of. The only thing is a vote on droog for his overreaction to the \"hammer\" on Riddleton (where it still stands, by the way). The vote itself is innocuous, in my opinion; less so is the fact that it still stands, without any reasonable justification, and in fact an explicit refusal to justify it. All of his other posts have been fluff. My stance: Scum. <br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\nTo sum up, I think that there are some people who lean further toward scum than others, and some people who are VERY tenuously on the fence, but who can easily fall one way or the other. For now, I think I will <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: droog</div>. His Riddleton hammer response and subsequent neighbor claim both seemed contrived. However, depending on how the next few pages of discussion go, I could easily see this vote switching to Riddleton/istott or Flubber.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#408000\"><div style=\"font-size: 80%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Tag fixed<br>\n~Mod</div></div></div></div></blockquote></div></div></div><br>\nI could see myself ending up on this.

That said, I don't have any particular leaning either way: I don't necessarily gather a scum vibe from him, but I haven't gotten any clear town tells from him either. My stance: Neutral. (Side note: I explicitly didn't vote for you in RVS because I dislike RVS in general; especially in this forum format where people may vote and then be away for an extended period, a person may be mistakenly lynched due to an RVS vote that would otherwise have been prevented in a different format. IGMEOY does the same thing, perhaps slightly less strongly, without the chance of mislynch). <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Originalchris:</div> My inclination here is scum. By <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6387583#p6387583\" class=\"postlink\">219</a> Willow had been posting several content posts, none of which I personally got a scum tell from. His entire case against Willow appears to be the \"scumtell of the year\" (commenting on the word \"anyway\"), and an apparent obsession with deflection, which is a convenient counter to almost any response and which can be both confusing and frustrating for the town. He also seems to be of an extremes mindset, by which I mean that if someone is accused to scum, then reasonable doubt is not enough to save, them, but rather we must go beyond a shadow of a doubt. This can be very dangerous later in the game, where a scum player can simply put a random town up for examination, and then cast doubt to create the lynch. My stance: Neutral.<br>\n<br>\nPedit: <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6389031#p6389031\" class=\"postlink\">370</a> is a great post. I don't necessarily agree with everything in it, but that he posted some more content is great, something that everyone should do, instead of posting fluff in order to look active. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">crazypianist1116: </div>Despite him asking both myself and kuror0 to post more, he has almost no posts of content. The only one I could find is <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6387135#p6387135\" class=\"postlink\">170</a>, but it is a very important post. I agree that if Munkir were not town, he would not have asked the question, though there are indeed some strange things with his post style (more on him later though). Not enough content here. My stance: Neutral.<br>\n<br>\nPedit: <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6389053#p6389053\" class=\"postlink\">373</a> is great, similar to 370 above. Again, I disagree with some of the points, but more content = good. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">istott:</div> I'd say that the most important interaction here is Riddleton's fake dayvig (actually had to look up what that was, had no clue that that even existed), his reaction to it, and his reaction to the aftermath. In my opinion, his reaction was fairly normal for a town, though a properly skilled scum player could fake it fairly easily I suppose. In order to arrive at this conclusion, we have to look at what a scum would do: <br>\n<br>\nIstott, having no knowledge of whether there was in fact a dayvig, has three options: Post a claim saying that he he's town, post a claim admitting to scum, or not posting at all and waiting to see if there was a mod announcement. <br>\n<br>\nIif he thinks there is indeed a dayvig, then:<br>\n<br>\n-Claiming town as scum does nothing; he's already dead. Claiming town as town also does nothing.<br>\n-Claiming scum as scum does nothing; he's already dead. Claiming scum as town is stupid. <br>\n-Therefore posting nothing is the only sensible response. He did not post nothing, so he must have thought that there was not a dayvig. Therefore:<br>\n<br>\n-Claiming town as scum could possibly save him. Claiming town as town could also save him.<br>\n-Claiming scum as scum would do nothing. Claiming scum as town is stupid.<br>\n-Posting nothing would lead to an accusation of dodging, although we don't know if the mod would immediately make an announcement of death, so it might lead to an examination to see if the dayvig actually existed based on mod response (or lack thereof). <br>\n<br>\nThe only conclusion that it is possible to draw is that istott did not think that there was a dayvig, but felt compelled to respond in the only logical manner, which was to claim town. This does not tell us anything about his role in and of itself, and I'm not experienced enough at reading forced tells to make a judgment on <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6387275#p6387275\" class=\"postlink\">192</a>. That said, he seems rather chilly in ISO 29-33. I don't know whether to label this as a scum trying to imitate a town keeping their emotions down, or the genuine article. Basically, my read is that I have no clear reads, however IGMEOY. My stance: Neutral.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Naomi-Tan:</div> Her biggest post by far is <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6387774#p6387774\" class=\"postlink\">245</a>, although <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6382825#p6382825\" class=\"postlink\">22</a> and <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6386982#p6386982\" class=\"postlink\">165</a> warrant consideration.<br>\n<br>\n22: I agree somewhat that acting newbish and naive in the beginning seemed like a possible smokescreen, but in my opinion she has since shown enough caution and general competence to be disavowed of that defense. I also share her views toward RVS in general, so I'm glad that she wanted to move on as soon as possible.<br>\n<br>\n165: There are lots of words here, but not much content. You say that 94 (you said 92 but meant 94) was a possibly-good, possibly-bad post, which is convenient waffling. You also state your ideas on how a point-by-point post should be structured, which doesn't really tell us anything at all. Moral of the story here is that lots of words does not mean lots of content.<br>\n<br>\n245: Another big post with very little actual content. The most important things are right at the end: She lists several negative things about originalchris, yet also states that she doesn't see him as scummy, and then proceeds to vote GGG for not talking, where her vote still stands, despite him actually posting several comments, both before and after her vote, of meaningful content. <br>\n<br>\nMy big problem with Naomi is that she tends to talk a lot but say very little. This can be detrimental in the long run, but I don't really get a scum vibe from it, either. That said, I haven't seen any town tells. My stance: Neutral.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Munkir: </div>Almost entirely no content at all. The most curious thing that I see is that in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6388698#p6388698\" class=\"postlink\">323</a>, he uses the term WIFOM. Either Naomi is giving him coaching (which I'm not particularly fond of in principle) or he's more familiar with the game than would be expected of a true newbie (in which case he has been <a href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity\" class=\"postlink\">obfuscating stupidity</a>). Either way, while I haven't seen any explicit scum tells, I'm uneasy about this player. My stance: Neutral, but IGMEOY.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">droog:</div> The first thing I have to say is that I really dislike his posting style. It reminds me of Runescape, and there's really no point to it on a forum where posts can be typed out in their entirety and be made grammatically correct. However, that doesn't really have a bearing on the game, and since he seems to be consistent with using that style over his previous games, I don't believe that there is some kind of posting restriction associated with his role.<br>\n<br>\nHis \"plan\" to prod out Riddleton as his neighbor was kind of strained and his reaction was very disproportionate. Can someone clarify to me if neighbors necessarily know the other neighbor's role? If so, then I could see a scum's attempt at a fake bus backfiring. Other than this, he's posted almost nothing of any substance. His freakout gave me a very negative vibe. My stance: Scum.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">GGG:</div> He brings up a good point about the isott-Riddleton dayvig exchange, which I hadn't considered. However, it would only be able to be staged if the scum were able to communicate outside of the thread. Is this possible? I'm not sure how the neighbor mechanic works (I had to look it up when analyzing droog above). I sort of agree with him about Riddleton bailing too easily on the fake dayvig. I don't know if it's enough to make me vote, since as I said such a ploy would only be possible if they were able to communicate, which we don't know is possible. So far, I get at least a neutral feeling, leaning toward town. My stance: Town.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">AWA:</div> obvious scum pls lynch.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">kuror0:</div> No content. I certainly understand the time problem, since I've been rather sparse myself, but with only one post so far it's very difficult to get any kind of read. My stance: Neutral.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Riddleton: </div>His dayvig test really unsettles me. It seems very forced, and he gives it up very quickly for something that is by nature only usable once per game. However, Like I said above, it's hard to see how this could be construed as scummy UNLESS he and istott were both scum, AND could have communicated outside of the thread. IGMEOY. My stance: Neutral, dependent on my views toward istott. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Flames682:</div> Just to address something that happened WAY back and has already been moved on from, I didn't IGMEOY Willow for bandwagoning GGG, but for bandwagoning Riddleton in the beginning. This sounds dumb, but I got to the bottom of the first page of posts and didn't realize that there were more pages before I replied (it's been a long time since I've post on any kind of message board). <br>\n<br>\nWhat I really don't like about him is that ISO 28-65 is all fluff, there's absolutely zero content whatsoever. In addition, his only other useful substance relates to the istott-Riddleton exchange (which I've already gone over several time); he jumps on istott for reacting in the only possible way he could have reacted (see above) and puts a vote down on top of that. Combined with his general rude and aggressive attitude and posting style, I get a negative vibe from him. Perhaps lower on my list than others, but still suspicious. My stance: Scum.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Flubbernugget: </div>First things first: Your avatar creeps me out. A lot. I would appreciate it if you would change it, but if you don't I'll live.<br>\n<br>\nIn regards to his content, there is actually very little here to go off of. The only thing is a vote on droog for his overreaction to the \"hammer\" on Riddleton (where it still stands, by the way). The vote itself is innocuous, in my opinion; less so is the fact that it still stands, without any reasonable justification, and in fact an explicit refusal to justify it. All of his other posts have been fluff. My stance: Scum. <br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\nTo sum up, I think that there are some people who lean further toward scum than others, and some people who are VERY tenuously on the fence, but who can easily fall one way or the other. For now, I think I will <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: droog</div>. His Riddleton hammer response and subsequent neighbor claim both seemed contrived. However, depending on how the next few pages of discussion go, I could easily see this vote switching to Riddleton/istott or Flubber.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#408000\"><div style=\"font-size: 80%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Tag fixed<br>\n~Mod</div></div></div></div></blockquote></div></div></div><br>\nI could see myself ending up on this.

Someone said she pulled such a terrible play she must be town but i don't agree whit that.

Next thing to work out was how often did he vote, See chart 1 (Votes Over days) I put the number of times he had voted accross an axis with the number of days the game had been running and saw a VERY sharp slope, all most 1 for 1 (days to votes) this would be an indicator of 1 of 3 things;1) Uncertain town. A town who is not really sure who is scummy and who is not, kinda bumbling about and wondering around, posts by these kinds of players sound all most unsure of themselves when they vote. 2) A long RVS - They happen, can last all most 7 days in extreme cases, however that is not applicable here. 3) Scum - Scum like suttlely pushing with votes here and there, unlike the unsure town, they are all most certain to know what they are doing. and it shows, there actions tend to be high aggression looking for a weaker target, and they tend to vote for people who are easy lynches.<br>\n<br>\nSo with point 1, Lots of vote Switching, Full filled I looked at point 2, Lurking (See the unlabled pie chart) I went and put all our names and the number of times we posted down and told google, put this into a pie chart, using this we can see that He makes up 4.4% of the total posts, given the post average of 7.5356% you could say that he has just over a half of average posts per a player. that was awkwardly phrased... anyway, yeah Lurking Check.<br>\n<br>\nThen I took a look at the content See pie chart 4. <br>\n<br>\nBelow all the charts you can see my Post x Post ISO of the entirity of what he said, with little comments on anything major, but the majority of his posts have been either attacking others or Null reads, with only a single post where he talks about someone else being townish, now as a town player, you need to be looking for townish as much as Scumish, and with only 1 defence, of munkir who is pretty clueless (or was so) but even that was followed with a counter point to it (effectively balancing it to null (though i count that as 1 attack 1 defence) this was 1 of the 3 yellow posts. which are the ones I wanna talk about. As you can see, he isn't really looking for town reads or at least hasn't commented on any, which doesn't seem like a town mind set. but even with that I wasn't certain, until I reviewed the people he had voted for.<br>\n<br>\nI Know i'm confirmed town, I have a slight feeling Whomping is town, and a fair feeling that Droog is town, so by combining my feelings on his vote count, and looking at the durations of the votes the stronger the player, the less the duration of the vote, which looks less like putting votes on who they think is scummy and more like pressuing to force lynches.<br>\n<br>\nso, going back a step, to his post contents, everything don't look too bad, alot of posts are Nulls, either correcting what he said, or stating stuff that isn't one way or another. the vast majority though are pointing of things that are 'scummy' but im repeating myself moving onto the yellow posts. <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6387135#p6387135\" class=\"postlink\">post 170 the first one I've already spoken about in the paragraph two above this.</a><br>\n<br>\n[quote=\"In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6389053#p6389053\" class=\"postlink\">post 373 The second one</a> I wanted to talk about was the post where he voted for me in it at first he Talks about the Willow O Chris thing, where he tried to pair Willow and Droog, At that point in the arguement though it had cooled off and it was obvious where most people stood it would been easy to join in right then taking a side to show that you was with the town majority, Then commented on the reaction test BS basicly saying its null like me. then proceeds to attack me, claiming I say i'm town too much. which is kinda a stupid argument <br>\n<br>\nbut in the next 2 posts he tries to defend his argument pretty much backing down on the second, less than 2 posts after he made his point, this doesn't seem like he either didn't believe or care about his views..<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: crazypianist1116</span><br>\nFor full filling all 3 suspicious thingys that I said above :3<br>\nSorry about the wait, was doing alot of number games.</div></div></div></div></blockquote><br>\nI don't like this.

Next thing to work out was how often did he vote, See chart 1 (Votes Over days) I put the number of times he had voted accross an axis with the number of days the game had been running and saw a VERY sharp slope, all most 1 for 1 (days to votes) this would be an indicator of 1 of 3 things;1) Uncertain town. A town who is not really sure who is scummy and who is not, kinda bumbling about and wondering around, posts by these kinds of players sound all most unsure of themselves when they vote. 2) A long RVS - They happen, can last all most 7 days in extreme cases, however that is not applicable here. 3) Scum - Scum like suttlely pushing with votes here and there, unlike the unsure town, they are all most certain to know what they are doing. and it shows, there actions tend to be high aggression looking for a weaker target, and they tend to vote for people who are easy lynches.<br>\n<br>\nSo with point 1, Lots of vote Switching, Full filled I looked at point 2, Lurking (See the unlabled pie chart) I went and put all our names and the number of times we posted down and told google, put this into a pie chart, using this we can see that He makes up 4.4% of the total posts, given the post average of 7.5356% you could say that he has just over a half of average posts per a player. that was awkwardly phrased... anyway, yeah Lurking Check.<br>\n<br>\nThen I took a look at the content See pie chart 4. <br>\n<br>\nBelow all the charts you can see my Post x Post ISO of the entirity of what he said, with little comments on anything major, but the majority of his posts have been either attacking others or Null reads, with only a single post where he talks about someone else being townish, now as a town player, you need to be looking for townish as much as Scumish, and with only 1 defence, of munkir who is pretty clueless (or was so) but even that was followed with a counter point to it (effectively balancing it to null (though i count that as 1 attack 1 defence) this was 1 of the 3 yellow posts. which are the ones I wanna talk about. As you can see, he isn't really looking for town reads or at least hasn't commented on any, which doesn't seem like a town mind set. but even with that I wasn't certain, until I reviewed the people he had voted for.<br>\n<br>\nI Know i'm confirmed town, I have a slight feeling Whomping is town, and a fair feeling that Droog is town, so by combining my feelings on his vote count, and looking at the durations of the votes the stronger the player, the less the duration of the vote, which looks less like putting votes on who they think is scummy and more like pressuing to force lynches.<br>\n<br>\nso, going back a step, to his post contents, everything don't look too bad, alot of posts are Nulls, either correcting what he said, or stating stuff that isn't one way or another. the vast majority though are pointing of things that are 'scummy' but im repeating myself moving onto the yellow posts. <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6387135#p6387135\" class=\"postlink\">post 170 the first one I've already spoken about in the paragraph two above this.</a><br>\n<br>\n[quote=\"In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6389053#p6389053\" class=\"postlink\">post 373 The second one</a> I wanted to talk about was the post where he voted for me in it at first he Talks about the Willow O Chris thing, where he tried to pair Willow and Droog, At that point in the arguement though it had cooled off and it was obvious where most people stood it would been easy to join in right then taking a side to show that you was with the town majority, Then commented on the reaction test BS basicly saying its null like me. then proceeds to attack me, claiming I say i'm town too much. which is kinda a stupid argument <br>\n<br>\nbut in the next 2 posts he tries to defend his argument pretty much backing down on the second, less than 2 posts after he made his point, this doesn't seem like he either didn't believe or care about his views..<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: crazypianist1116</span><br>\nFor full filling all 3 suspicious thingys that I said above :3<br>\nSorry about the wait, was doing alot of number games.</div></div></div></div></blockquote><br>\nI don't like this.

That said, I don't have any particular leaning either way: I don't necessarily gather a scum vibe from him, but I haven't gotten any clear town tells from him either. My stance: Neutral. (Side note: I explicitly didn't vote for you in RVS because I dislike RVS in general; especially in this forum format where people may vote and then be away for an extended period, a person may be mistakenly lynched due to an RVS vote that would otherwise have been prevented in a different format. IGMEOY does the same thing, perhaps slightly less strongly, without the chance of mislynch). <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Originalchris:</div> My inclination here is scum. By <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6387583#p6387583\" class=\"postlink\">219</a> Willow had been posting several content posts, none of which I personally got a scum tell from. His entire case against Willow appears to be the \"scumtell of the year\" (commenting on the word \"anyway\"), and an apparent obsession with deflection, which is a convenient counter to almost any response and which can be both confusing and frustrating for the town. He also seems to be of an extremes mindset, by which I mean that if someone is accused to scum, then reasonable doubt is not enough to save, them, but rather we must go beyond a shadow of a doubt. This can be very dangerous later in the game, where a scum player can simply put a random town up for examination, and then cast doubt to create the lynch. My stance: Neutral.<br>\n<br>\nPedit: <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6389031#p6389031\" class=\"postlink\">370</a> is a great post.

The only one I could find is <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6387135#p6387135\" class=\"postlink\">170</a>, but it is a very important post. I agree that if Munkir were not town, he would not have asked the question, though there are indeed some strange things with his post style (more on him later though). Not enough content here.

Again, I disagree with some of the points, but more content = good. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">istott:</div> I'd say that the most important interaction here is Riddleton's fake dayvig (actually had to look up what that was, had no clue that that even existed), his reaction to it, and his reaction to the aftermath. In my opinion, his reaction was fairly normal for a town, though a properly skilled scum player could fake it fairly easily I suppose. In order to arrive at this conclusion, we have to look at what a scum would do: <br>\n<br>\nIstott, having no knowledge of whether there was in fact a dayvig, has three options: Post a claim saying that he he's town, post a claim admitting to scum, or not posting at all and waiting to see if there was a mod announcement. <br>\n<br>\nIif he thinks there is indeed a dayvig, then:<br>\n<br>\n-Claiming town as scum does nothing; he's already dead. Claiming town as town also does nothing.<br>\n-Claiming scum as scum does nothing; he's already dead. Claiming scum as town is stupid. <br>\n-Therefore posting nothing is the only sensible response. He did not post nothing, so he must have thought that there was not a dayvig. Therefore:<br>\n<br>\n-Claiming town as scum could possibly save him. Claiming town as town could also save him.<br>\n-Claiming scum as scum would do nothing. Claiming scum as town is stupid.<br>\n-Posting nothing would lead to an accusation of dodging, although we don't know if the mod would immediately make an announcement of death, so it might lead to an examination to see if the dayvig actually existed based on mod response (or lack thereof). <br>\n<br>\nThe only conclusion that it is possible to draw is that istott did not think that there was a dayvig, but felt compelled to respond in the only logical manner, which was to claim town. This does not tell us anything about his role in and of itself, and I'm not experienced enough at reading forced tells to make a judgment on <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6387275#p6387275\" class=\"postlink\">192</a>. That said, he seems rather chilly in ISO 29-33. I don't know whether to label this as a scum trying to imitate a town keeping their emotions down, or the genuine article. Basically, my read is that I have no clear reads, however IGMEOY. My stance: Neutral.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Naomi-Tan:</div> Her biggest post by far is <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6387774#p6387774\" class=\"postlink\">245</a>, although <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6382825#p6382825\" class=\"postlink\">22</a> and <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6386982#p6386982\" class=\"postlink\">165</a> warrant consideration.<br>\n<br>\n22: I agree somewhat that acting newbish and naive in the beginning seemed like a possible smokescreen, but in my opinion she has since shown enough caution and general competence to be disavowed of that defense. I also share her views toward RVS in general, so I'm glad that she wanted to move on as soon as possible.<br>\n<br>\n165: There are lots of words here, but not much content. You say that 94 (you said 92 but meant 94) was a possibly-good, possibly-bad post, which is convenient waffling. You also state your ideas on how a point-by-point post should be structured, which doesn't really tell us anything at all. Moral of the story here is that lots of words does not mean lots of content.<br>\n<br>\n245: Another big post with very little actual content. The most important things are right at the end: She lists several negative things about originalchris, yet also states that she doesn't see him as scummy, and then proceeds to vote GGG for not talking, where her vote still stands, despite him actually posting several comments, both before and after her vote, of meaningful content. <br>\n<br>\nMy big problem with Naomi is that she tends to talk a lot but say very little. This can be detrimental in the long run, but I don't really get a scum vibe from it, either. That said, I haven't seen any town tells. My stance: Neutral.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Munkir: </div>Almost entirely no content at all. The most curious thing that I see is that in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6388698#p6388698\" class=\"postlink\">323</a>, he uses the term WIFOM. Either Naomi is giving him coaching (which I'm not particularly fond of in principle) or he's more familiar with the game than would be expected of a true newbie (in which case he has been <a href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity\" class=\"postlink\">obfuscating stupidity</a>). Either way, while I haven't seen any explicit scum tells, I'm uneasy about this player. My stance: Neutral, but IGMEOY.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">droog:</div> The first thing I have to say is that I really dislike his posting style. It reminds me of Runescape, and there's really no point to it on a forum where posts can be typed out in their entirety and be made grammatically correct. However, that doesn't really have a bearing on the game, and since he seems to be consistent with using that style over his previous games, I don't believe that there is some kind of posting restriction associated with his role.<br>\n<br>\nHis \"plan\" to prod out Riddleton as his neighbor was kind of strained and his reaction was very disproportionate. Can someone clarify to me if neighbors necessarily know the other neighbor's role? If so, then I could see a scum's attempt at a fake bus backfiring. Other than this, he's posted almost nothing of any substance. His freakout gave me a very negative vibe. My stance: Scum.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">GGG:</div> He brings up a good point about the isott-Riddleton dayvig exchange, which I hadn't considered. However, it would only be able to be staged if the scum were able to communicate outside of the thread. Is this possible? I'm not sure how the neighbor mechanic works (I had to look it up when analyzing droog above). I sort of agree with him about Riddleton bailing too easily on the fake dayvig. I don't know if it's enough to make me vote, since as I said such a ploy would only be possible if they were able to communicate, which we don't know is possible. So far, I get at least a neutral feeling, leaning toward town. My stance: Town.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">AWA:</div> obvious scum pls lynch.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">kuror0:</div> No content. I certainly understand the time problem, since I've been rather sparse myself, but with only one post so far it's very difficult to get any kind of read. My stance: Neutral.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Riddleton: </div>His dayvig test really unsettles me. It seems very forced, and he gives it up very quickly for something that is by nature only usable once per game. However, Like I said above, it's hard to see how this could be construed as scummy UNLESS he and istott were both scum, AND could have communicated outside of the thread. IGMEOY. My stance: Neutral, dependent on my views toward istott. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Flames682:</div> Just to address something that happened WAY back and has already been moved on from, I didn't IGMEOY Willow for bandwagoning GGG, but for bandwagoning Riddleton in the beginning. This sounds dumb, but I got to the bottom of the first page of posts and didn't realize that there were more pages before I replied (it's been a long time since I've post on any kind of message board). <br>\n<br>\nWhat I really don't like about him is that ISO 28-65 is all fluff, there's absolutely zero content whatsoever. In addition, his only other useful substance relates to the istott-Riddleton exchange (which I've already gone over several time); he jumps on istott for reacting in the only possible way he could have reacted (see above) and puts a vote down on top of that. Combined with his general rude and aggressive attitude and posting style, I get a negative vibe from him. Perhaps lower on my list than others, but still suspicious. My stance: Scum.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Flubbernugget: </div>First things first: Your avatar creeps me out. A lot. I would appreciate it if you would change it, but if you don't I'll live.<br>\n<br>\nIn regards to his content, there is actually very little here to go off of. The only thing is a vote on droog for his overreaction to the \"hammer\" on Riddleton (where it still stands, by the way). The vote itself is innocuous, in my opinion; less so is the fact that it still stands, without any reasonable justification, and in fact an explicit refusal to justify it. All of his other posts have been fluff. My stance: Scum. <br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\nTo sum up, I think that there are some people who lean further toward scum than others, and some people who are VERY tenuously on the fence, but who can easily fall one way or the other. For now, I think I will <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: droog</div>. His Riddleton hammer response and subsequent neighbor claim both seemed contrived. However, depending on how the next few pages of discussion go, I could easily see this vote switching to Riddleton/istott or Flubber.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#408000\"><div style=\"font-size: 80%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Tag fixed<br>\n~Mod</div></div></div></div></blockquote></div></div></div><br>\nI could see myself ending up on this.

Crap :/ My bad!<br>\n3: When did i directly ask how someone viewed me?<br>\n4: I look for misunderstandings, lies, and contradictions. Town responses will generally benefit them, as if they dont have as solid a grasp on the case against them, the misunderstanding is brought to light and it allows a town to better defend themselves. Conversely, a scum has to think more deeply about why they are being voted. They have to put themselves in the shoes of a town voting them, which is difficult and can lead to mistakes.

Perhaps this is a gameplay flaw of mine, but I feel that a vote is an extremely powerful tool, and should be used as a tool, not as a cudgel. When I saw AGar throwing cotes around like candy, I naturally got worried about his free usage of this most powerful tool. I was \"quiet for a while\" because I did not get the chance to check mafiascum.net for the remainder of the day; check the timestamps before making time-related posts. While I did target AGar, I did not target Michel. I question the validity of this FOS, especially as the reasoning is \"There is nothing concrete here\". When why FOS?/I don't understand the FOS on Michel, either. What I got from this \"analysis\" is that he confused you, so he's suspicious. I'm not buying it./TBM garners the most questions, yet does not receive an FOS. Interesting./This is your only slightly valid FOS, and even then I thihnk it's flimsy. yes, AGar's been unwieldy with his attacks, but you construct your \"argument\" based on his clout.<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=2345043#p2345043\" class=\"postlink\">Post #69</a>: I refuse to allow you to force anything, be it alcohol, a movie, or whatever, take responsibility for your actions.

Implausible, yes. But not impossible. Particularly as a new player, though I hesitate to bring this into the discussion, he would be more jumpy than others when a case, and a flimsy, ad hominem one at that, was being built against him. <br>\n<a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=2351035#p2351035\" class=\"postlink\">Post #110</a>: \"When I think someone is scum, I pressure them until they break.\" This has never occurred to you to be a poor way to play?

No read.<br>\n<br>\nscrel1- A lot of his reactions can be chalked up to newbishness, but I want to stay away from that. That said, his reactions, when viewed objectively, are fairly natural. Not willing to say protown, however.<br>\n<br>\nOso- Nothing.<br>\n<br>\nEquinox- Nothing of interest.<br>\n<br>\nTheButtonmen- Currently my candidate for the scummiest player in the game. I believe that his terse attitude, combined with his blunt posts can be called a scumtell. He has provide zero reasoning behind any of his actions thus far in the game, and is promoting mob mentality and therefore directly anti-town. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: TheButtonmen</div><br>\n<br>\nAGar- Not a fan of his penchant for ad hominem and insults. They frankly muddy the posts of relevance by steeping them in emotion, which in turn allows players to interpret facts differently when there should be a single truth for a given fact.

The only pause I have about this is that some of AWA's 'caught me for the wrong reasons' indignation perhaps suggests that Flubber might have flipped scum and AWA was hoping to get towncred for dumping him, but if it was a bussing attempt then AWA bungled it badly early on.

But the most compelling piece of evidence for the existence of a mafia faction is the 1-shot Gunsmith Werewolf flip.  As per the wiki page, gunsmiths can detect other gunsmiths, cops, vigilantes, and mafia.  Two deaths over one night makes vigilante unlikely.  Cops and town gunsmiths wouldn't pose a threat to werewolves even if they did exist, so if the intent of including the role was that, there's very little utility in it for them.  The only alternative is that the moderator is trying to mislead the werewolves into thinking there's mafia.  There doesn't seem to be much of a goal in doing that, aside from a sadistic moderator who just likes to confuse his players.<br>\n<br>\nAs for Naomi's objection that there isn't 4 scum in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6432231#p6432231\">Post 1303</a>, I can think of two open 13 player set-ups that involve 4 scum and 9 town: <a href=\"http://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Fire_and_Ice\" class=\"postlink\">Fire and Ice</a> and <a href=\"http://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Enemy_of_My_Enemy\" class=\"postlink\">Enemy of My Enemy.</a>  Two scum factions are explicitly normal as per the <a href=\"http://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Normal\" class=\"postlink\">Normalcy Wiki page.</a>  There's nothing about 2 scum factions of two members each that's beyond the pale.<br>\n<br>\nThat leaves us with the objection of why there have been so few kills, but failed kills could be explained by the existence of a doc, bulletproof, or jailkeeper.  There's also the potential that mafia are playing a gambit by declining to kill to push the idea that there's only one scum faction and establish bogus assumptions off of which most of the town scumhunts.  This leads into my next section.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\"><div style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">ChannelDelibird</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\nThe first problem that greets us in this ISO is that there doesn't seem to be very much thinking beyond the superficial in terms of setup and, specifically, how many factions there are.  <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6432379#p6432379\">Post 1308</a> is the major \"catch-up\" post where he establishes very firmly that he's looking for another werewolf.  Considering he spends a <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">great</div> deal of time in formulating these reads, the basic assumption making up their foundation receives a shockingly superficial examination.  There's no mention of the monkey wrench in the \"one faction\" theory: the gunsmith flip.  I think the reason the faction issue is receiving so little scrutiny is because there's something to gain by not giving it any.  It's obvious from other posting that ChannelDelibird is capable of doing in-depth analysis, but he chooses not to do it when it comes to the setup.<br>\n<br>\nThen there's the reads themselves and how they show up Day 3.  Here's his summary of the entire post: \"<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">I strongly suspect that there's only one scumteam and that GGG</div> is its final member. If not him, originalchris would be the next place to look. Whatever you do, <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">never lynch TellTaleHeart</div> or droog. Don't listen to anything DGB said after her self-vote.\"  Fast-forwarding to Day 3, we see there's a pretty drastic change in the reads list.  In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6451015#p6451015\">Post 1428</a>, he said he was a lot less confidence in the townread on my slot based on a factually inaccurate case made by someone he was scumreading.  There's already something wrong with that by itself, and that's before you even consider how the GGG read got to the state it's in now.  At the time of the catch up, GGG was the leading scumread by a \"reasonably wide\" gap.  To fill in that gap, ChannelDelibird cited <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6439534#p6439534\">Post 1383</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6439654#p6439654\">Post 1385</a>, neither of which <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">should</div> have assuaged his suspicions.  Post 1383 is GGG calling attention to his own interactions with DGB in an attempt to make the argument that it's exculpatory evidence, an argument which should void itself once made given that you can manipulate your own interactions.  The idea of distancing seems to not occur to ChannelDelibird, though it should have because he was approaching the reread with a strong GGG scumread.  Post 1385 is an admission that GGG botched the read.  This is an undeniable fact at this point and as scum GGG would only make himself look bad by continuing to deny it or excuse it, so why that post would indicate GGG is town is not apparent.<br>\n<br>\nIn short, the changing reads don't make sense given the goings on in the thread, what GGG said, and the scant explanation given by ChannelDelibird himself.  That read feels too malleable to be genuine.  I think ChannelDelibird is scum.", "time": "Mon Dec 15, 2014 10:08 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=59806&start=1425", "forum": "53", "thread": "59806"}
