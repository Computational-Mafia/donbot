When I vote, there are only two questions: do I find this person scummy, and does this scummyness warrant a vote? If yes, then I vote. Are you really saying that you decide that you want to vote before you decide who to vote for? That really doesn't make sense, outside of RVS. But that still doesn't make sense: you don't decide the aim of a vote after you decide to vote. We, as human beings, don't act without a reason. We don't perform an action randomly and make up a reason to do it later. That's just silly.<br>\n<br>\n2. The thing that bothers me the most is how you are acting. The first question posed to you concerned why you voted on a bandwagon but said it was random. You could've just admitted you lied about it being random to get a bandwagon. That's more or less what you're saying now: that vote was to get a bandwagon going and lead us out of RVS. Which is fine. But you refused to admit that you lied, or made a mistake, or used ambiguous grammar, or whatever concerning the random part. Basically, you keep saying that this misunderstanding is ALL OUR FAULT and you are NOT TO BLAME AT ALL. Which is a total overreaction. The worst you could have been accused of is trying to end RVS early or using a poor choice of words, neither of which are proper tells. You seem VERY concerned with keeping your reputation in this game as clean as possible, which doesn't make sense unless you have something to hide.<br>\n<br>\n3.

When I vote, there are only two questions: do I find this person scummy, and does this scummyness warrant a vote? If yes, then I vote. Are you really saying that you decide that you want to vote before you decide who to vote for? That really doesn't make sense, outside of RVS. But that still doesn't make sense: you don't decide the aim of a vote after you decide to vote. We, as human beings, don't act without a reason. We don't perform an action randomly and make up a reason to do it later. That's just silly.<br>\n<br>\n2. The thing that bothers me the most is how you are acting. The first question posed to you concerned why you voted on a bandwagon but said it was random. You could've just admitted you lied about it being random to get a bandwagon. That's more or less what you're saying now: that vote was to get a bandwagon going and lead us out of RVS. Which is fine. But you refused to admit that you lied, or made a mistake, or used ambiguous grammar, or whatever concerning the random part. Basically, you keep saying that this misunderstanding is ALL OUR FAULT and you are NOT TO BLAME AT ALL. Which is a total overreaction. The worst you could have been accused of is trying to end RVS early or using a poor choice of words, neither of which are proper tells. You seem VERY concerned with keeping your reputation in this game as clean as possible, which doesn't make sense unless you have something to hide.<br>\n<br>\n3. So... you voted me when you thought I was on your case, and unvoted when you thought I was off? Can you get any OMGUS than that?</div></blockquote>\n\n1. Umbrage there are those two questions but that doesn't take out the three decisions you make while you vote. No matter how you do it you still have to decide if you are going to vote, who you are going to vote and how serious it is, I'll give you that order doesn't matter, but you still make those three decisions. There is no skipping it. It doesn't make sense that vote someone you want to lynch with out having decided who it is, you don't target someone you find very suspicious with out deciding whether he warrants a vote or not. These decisions have to be there otherwise it doesn't make sense. At best you can skip the seriousness of it but that isn't recommended for good town play.<br>\n<br>\n2. I'm over reacting? I'm being wagoned (or was) because you claimed my vote wasn't random, despite it being so. You understand from my point of view, you're the one over reacting? You want to lynch me because you think my random vote wasn't random? Good luck with that.<br>\n<br>\n3. No I voted you when I thought you were purposely taking my quotes out of context to show me in a scummy manner, I unvoted you when I realized you were claiming not to understand what I was saying. &lt;- Not OMGUS.<br>\n<br>\nAs for Furcolow, I was waiting for this. I IC'd him in a newbie game and defended him to my death. <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=11&amp;t=15073\" class=\"postlink\">Read it here.</a> I actually suggest the read, otherwise very shortly you will all be pushing Furcolows wagon and I'll end up dying because of it.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>ThAdmiral wrote:</cite>If he had admitted straight up it was a joke vote or a vote specifically to push the bandwagon I wouldn't have stayed on his case.

These are just groups of players that I have paired up for one reason or another (aka not at random - I'll let everyone else attempt to figure out why these people are grouped together), in an attempt to help us find scum.

I have created these groups with this and other things in mind, and I guarantee I am semi-correct in my assumptions. I have to note that some scum will buddy up to one of their teammates but not the other, in order to go against the typical scum behavior I just mentioned. So, Groups 2-5 can have both scum, while Group 1 is highly unlikely to be a three-man scumteam. Does that make sense?<br>\n<br>\nLike I said, Groups 2 and 4 are most likely to have scum in them. Group 3 is also possible, depending on the alignments of groups 2 and 4, but 2 and 4 are my primary suspect groups.

Logically, that would seem true, but my gut says that each group <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">possibly</div> has at least one town member in it.

These are just groups of players that I have paired up for one reason or another (aka not at random - I'll let everyone else attempt to figure out why these people are grouped together), in an attempt to help us find scum. I'll repeat the groups:<br>\n<br>\nGroup 1: el simo, Olinea, Furcolow<br>\nGroup 2: Thirdkoopa, TheLonging<br>\nGroup 3: oritz, Umbrage<br>\nGroup 4: Cyberbob, sorasgoof<br>\nGroup 5: chamber, ThAdmiral<br>\n<br>\nScum typically try to distance themselves from one another most of the time. I have created these groups with this and other things in mind, and I guarantee I am semi-correct in my assumptions. I have to note that some scum will buddy up to one of their teammates but not the other, in order to go against the typical scum behavior I just mentioned. So, Groups 2-5 can have both scum, while Group 1 is highly unlikely to be a three-man scumteam. Does that make sense?<br>\n<br>\nLike I said, Groups 2 and 4 are most likely to have scum in them. Group 3 is also possible, depending on the alignments of groups 2 and 4, but 2 and 4 are my primary suspect groups. I said earlier that each group has at least one town member in it, however, I'd like to correct myself. Logically, that would seem true, but my gut says that each group <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">possibly</div> has at least one town member in it.

First off, thanks Pie for actually getting us going (imo).  Looking back on it, Umbrage and El Simo both look town (or atleast not scum) and the votes on them came from our lack of anything else to go on.<br>\n<br>\n-Pie is coming off very town.  Pretty sure, but he could be messing with his meta because I think I caught him in our last game together (F&amp;I), and Fugi is getting a good grasp on his scum meta too.  <br>\n<br>\n-I don't think TK is scum.  I can see a few scummy things he's done, but he just comes off as having an r2r meta to me (the one where r2r lacks the ability to make a decision on Day 1 so people always call him scum for it).  I guess I wouldn't be surprised if he flipped scum, but I just don't think he is, and definitely not worth a vote.  Someone said something earlier along the lines of \"town being made scummy\" and I think that could be happening here.  I stand by the scummiest thing he did was unvoting as soon as he got called out.<br>\n<br>\n-I'm still suspicious of Soras, mainly because of his posts involving Pie.  <br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Soras wrote:</cite>This whole group thing and the huge posts seem like very over the top ways of trying to make yourself look town, Pie.</div></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Soras wrote:</cite>@Olinea, Pie: This is the same thing Pie did in GHM1, if I remember correctly. I'm not saying he's scum here, but everyone went along with what he said in GHM1, and the town lost because of it (his mafia team did too, but that's not the point <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\">).

Those are his (valid) opinions, but people looking at these groups should take other things into account, and not take them to heart so quickly (I don't know if people have yet).</div></blockquote>\n\nThis comes off to me as trying to discredit Pie as soon as he starts his case on TK.  The first thing I thought was chainsaw, but that would require TK being scum, and then he voted TK in the next post so idk.  I still don't like it.  <br>\n<br>\nAlso, I don't like his reactions to suspicion being placed on him.  His reactions to Chamber early in the game, the last vote on him, and my post just don't read well to me.  He just comes off overly hostile in those posts.  <br>\n<br>\n+I think TK is the second wagon he jumped on (I think he was on one earlier when chamber voted for him), which isn't necessarily a scumtell, but still worth mentioning.  <br>\n<br>\nThat is the reasoning behind soras being second on my scumlist.  <br>\n<br>\n--<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">unvote, vote CyberBob</div><br>\n<br>\nYou think TK got away with a lot?

I think pretty much every player has commented on my switch to soras now, and a few have found it scummy. soras switch to 3K didn't sit right with me. Admittedly, my case on 3K was weak - the only thing to come out of it was a rise in his activity level and his unvote, which is scummy, yes. But... here's where I have to concede. 3K is looking less scummy the more I read his posts. I still want 3K dead at some point soon, but he's posting decent content. I don't mind keeping him alive for today, yet I'll still hammer his wagon if it builds to that point. Especially if, with lack of pressure, his activity level drops. If he is scum, now he has to keep posting at a decent rate because I called him out for lurking, which means more chances for him to slip. If he's town, I helped motivate him to help the town.

I'm not going to go back and take a million quotes, because that's close to how many there are, but it's mostly about his gameplay. He's playing a very OMGUS style, people suspicious of him garner his suspicion back. Then awhile ago when he claimed a VI account that set off some major alarms, but that seems to have been covered to death. I'm not going to let it go though. I still can't see a town member actually claiming to be a VI account simply because they've caught some suspicion. And notice how the posting dropped off after the VI claim. Seems to be a common scum tactic to fly under the radar like that as well. The \"content\" that he posts is sketchy at best. Seems to be to be full of fake scum-tells and filler material. Example:<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Furcolow wrote:</cite>I'm going to be busy tomorrow<br>\nmoving my placeholder vote, because cyberbob is probably town (yes, i know what a placeholder vote is!)<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">unvote: cyberbob</div><br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: umbrage</span><br>\nI feel like his posting is too-defensive and is forced</div></blockquote>\n\nDefensive? How is he supposed to talk to people who are suspicious of him? By not defending himself. Forced? Saying something feels forced is usually a load of shit and usually seems to be a scum-tell used by scum to fake gut reads on people. And I can bet he'll defend those reasons by saying it's just a placeholder, but even placeholder votes need good reasons. There's no town motivation for using bad reasons for any vote.<br>\n<br>\nIf completely necessary, I can do a post-by-post, but just ISO him and you'll see what I'm talking about.

Some good cases have been made on ortiz, el simo, and myself, yet none of us appear to be a valid lynch option. In my opinion, the scum are likely very active posters and thinkers in this game and are trying to steer attention toward the ones who aren't as active. I don't like how wagons grew so quickly on ThirdKoopa and sorasgoof. I'm surprised nobody has suggested I'm scum with TK, because if I was, I couldn't have done a better job of redirecting everyone's attention to soras and saving my partner.

All I saw before my last post was diddin's flame warning, Furcolow claiming miller, and the last votals.  I went and got my phone out so I could read the thread from my sora vote forward and people (apparently) calling me out for lurking (and then posting after I got called out for it?) pissed me off enough to come up stairs and post.  I LAST POSTED ON JANUARY 4TH.  I have never felt a need to flame someone and call them an idiot in a mafia game until now.  I literally stayed up posting until midnight, went to bed, went to school, went straight to work from school, came home and immediately went to my computer.  If we're playing a game where we start calling people for lurking after a fucking school day I will replace out because I won't be able to keep up.  /rant<br>\n<br>\nI also just realized I can only respond to certain things because the posting is outgoing what I can post right now so if I missed something I need to comment on bring it up specifically.  <br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Cyberbob wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Fugitive wrote:</cite>@CB - what was wrong with what ortiz said?

Considering I posted my reasons for voting you, when I uhh voted you?  Yes I'm bringing suspicion on you, it's called trying to get scum lynched.  Your \"in lieu of a case\" is a blatant lie.  And I don't get c.  <br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Umbrage wrote:</cite>ortiz: I said I was trying to see the case on him, and I still am, because everyone else has called him scummy as various points in the game. Obviously, I'm starting to feel that I'm missing something. Obviously, I would want to understand why other find him scummy.</div></blockquote>\n\nI don't get it either, there is no case on me at all.  The only point I've seen made that holds merit was buddying with Pie.  Olinea and Thadmiral litterally made something up, and other people keep saying \"oritz is scum or oritz is scummy\" without any reasoning.  I tore Admiral's case to pieces and he just unvoted (no one has mentioned this btw) and then I think he still called me scum again in his last post, can't remember and don't have time to look right now.  <br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>simo wrote:</cite>Great two votes hopped off TK now we are no where near a lynch.

Word for word.  <br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>CB wrote:</cite>don't much like el simo pushing the deadline paranoia thing + the \"I want x gone but if I really have to would go with y\" thing either</div></blockquote>\n\nSeems perfectly fine to me.

If soras (or even fur) hadn't claimed, I'd still be pushing for Umbrage or 3K. =/</div></blockquote>\n\nThis feels over cautious and prematurely defensive to me, qualifying your actions like that. The \"I know I said this but I'm not being a hypocrite because...\" <br>\n<br>\nIt's kind of like a sophisticated inb4 so you can do something suspicious but claim it's not suspicious. \n</div></blockquote>\n\nGot a similar read off of it.  Just to note right now (because I can't call it a good vote later when someone votes Pie without voicing suspicion previously apparently) I've been getting bad vibes from Pie the last few pages.  <br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Fugi wrote:</cite>ortiz is falling under the radar too.</div></blockquote>  Is this where Fugi called me for lurking?

I slowed down my posting on like page 4 when they were complaining about us going too quickly.  Seriously I have posted as much as anyone and I bet as much as 2/3 of the players in this game.  I guess I could just hide my online status like you. <br>\n<br>\n--<br>\n<br>\nI posted here.  I just looked at the votals and put my vote on my 2nd scumread, which I've proclaimed for a while.  I even said yesterday (I think?) that I'd like to get a soras wagon going or a CB lynch and if neither then I\"d lynch whoever to make sure a lynch went through.  I followed through on my post.  That put it at 4-4.  I even said I wasn't going to have much time to post and that I'll check again and vote to make sure we have a lynch go through.  <br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>CB wrote:</cite>\nlmao ortiz you best be prepared tomorrow son</div></blockquote>\n\nFor what?

You're pushing this hard and I think I mentioned a long time ago that you're playing scummy by pretty much trying to get a PR wagoned/suspicioned/lynched.  Yes I have also read your posts and do not recall you ever saying Fugi is scummy for xxx that isn't involved with the softclaim.  <br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>soras wrote:</cite>Ortiz, that was an awful post.

This is actually the first time I've ever done anything like this, so I'm sure some parts of it are not going to make sense and could perhaps contradict itself.

However, he kept his composure during that whole \"random\" thing, and after an explanation, I don't think he's necessarily scummy.<br>\n-Question: Why do you think my unvote on you is scummy? You used it as part of your case on me (or at least as part of your vote), but in your ISO27, you said you felt comfortable with an unvote on Ortiz because you felt like he understood you. I finally understood you, and my unvote earned me suspicion? What the fu...<br>\n-Just noting a connection between Furcolow and el simo. NOT SAYING THIS IS NECESSARILY SCUMMY.<br>\n-WOW. Everyone read el simo's ISO51. Does that not sound EXACTLY LIKE ME? Except he's defending Furcolow for it? I don't even...His ISO63 is much the same.<br>\n-Seems very interested in TK..<br>\n(Anywhere from leaning town to leaning scum, actually. Hard for me to get a read at this point).<br>\n<br>\n3. ThAdmiral- I don't remember anybody saying anything about THAdmiral, actually. I'm getting townish vibes from him, and no, not just because he said he thinks I'm town. Maybe it's just the fact that he needs to post more; the town read isn't solid, and I'd need to see more from him to lean far in either direction.<br>\n(Neutral leaning town)<br>\n<br>\n4. Furcolow- Claimed Miller, correct? The way he is acting makes me think he really is a Miller. Claiming Miller early in the game does have a town motivation, as it keeps investigative roles from investigating him. In fact, I did this same thing in the last game I played in (I WAS a Town Miller). Overall, seems like a solid town read to me. I like his content, such as ISO39 and ISO40 (the confident way in which he delivers it is giving me town vibes). However, the claim does make me want to keep an eye on him, just because of the nature of the claim.<br>\n(Town)<br>\n<br>\n5. Umbrage- Boy, where do I even begin? Extremely hostile for no real reason. I never have liked his completely horrible case on el simo in his ISO9. I also very much dislike his ISO23. That reaction is awful. Also, what was that about a Mason claim? Where did that come from? I don't like that, either. Connection between Cyberbob and Umbrage established in ISO24. ISO25: Detached? What does that even mean? Like, not caring? ISO26: You don't care to play with people \"spouting off slurs?\" Oh, like you? &gt;_&gt; *Not part of my read, just annoying* ISO29: Hahahahah. Ha. *Not part of my read* ISO31: Misrepping me all the way. I had no intention of anything you said. Then, in your next post, you say that wagoning is fine, while wagoning without reasoning is not. You were suspicious of me because I \"wagoned\" TK, even though I gave reasoning. Therefore, my \"wagon\" should have been okay. Also, I don't like your read on Cyberbob in ISO34. You said he was the most town player in the game, yet you wouldn't weep at his lynch? What the I don't even... Then there's the whole voting Fugitive despite thinking he softclaimed. That doesn't make any sense whatsoever. You're voting someone who you think is trying to softclaim? Okay. In your ISO38, you say you would most like to lynch Furcolow, despite all the stuff you did with me in your previous posts. Literally seven hours before, you liked where your vote was on me, then you say you want to lynch Furcolow (yet you DON't move your vote). THEN, after being sort of called out by Pie over the Fugitive softclaim thing, you vote Fugitive. I REALLY do not like this part AT ALL. That was an AWFUL vote. Woooow. ISO45 has you moving your vote to Furcolow. This is so...okay. After all of this, you still don't have your vote on me. Why? You still think I'm scum, yet your vote is on Furcolow.<br>\n(SCUM)<br>\n<br>\n6. chamber-bad vote on me in ISO17 (I feel like it was a bad vote because he Voted me because I was the fourth on the wagon). Up until this point, I had a feeling that his posts didn't really have any content at all, despite what he says. He hasn't posted enough for a great read, like THAdmiral. I'm getting an \"airy\" feel from his posts, if that makes sense.<br>\n(neutral)<br>\n<br>\n8. InflatablePie- I hate the groups thing. I don't see a connection between most of those groups. What I REALLY don't like about IP is the way he says he's 100% positive on TK and moves his vote to me without any clear new reasoning/content. He commends Umbrage on his reasoning, and it looks like he blatantly bandwagons. Then, Pie says how he is becoming unsure on TK. I thought you were 100%? I'm starting to see a connection between IP and Fugi, also. I'll show you the examples of that if you ask for it. I want to get this whole thing over with tonight. ISO33: I DO care if people find me scummy, actually. I WANT to win, and when I feel people are voting reasons I feel are unjustified, I get bitter. ISO36: Woah, back to TK. So, you were 100% on TK, you move to me after bandwagoning with Umbrage, you say you had a bad (or at least lackluster) case on TK, then you move back to TK. You say it's because you're feeling worse about Umbrage, but I don't know if I buy that. This whole situation with Umbrage, you, TK, and me is scummy, in my opinion. THEN HE VOTES UMBRAGE. I don't get it! WHO ARE YOU MOST SUSPICIOUS OF? Somehow, I jump back above Umbrage even though I wasn't doing anything differently than before, and now TK is only an FoS. I'm genuinely confused.<br>\n(leaning scum to scum)<br>\n<br>\n9. Olinea-I'm feeling him as town, as well, though he was been completely flying under the radar. I think Olinea is one of the only players who hasn't had any suspicion placed upon him. I like his content, especially concerning TK and Umbrage<br>\n<br>\n10. Cyberbob- I can't believe no one has said anything about his ISO24. What is with those reads? Then there's a bad vote on Thirdkoopa. A BLATANT bandwagon. \"duck duck duck duck duck duck goose Unvote, Vote: Thirdkoopa\" REALLY? It looks like you think Umbrage and ortiz are scummier, yet you vote TK, presumably because that was the biggest wagon at the time. I mean, come on. Your ISO38 is where I get confused, really. You say you still think the scum team is Ortiz/TK/Umbrage. Okay. Well, you voted Furcolow in your last vote post, for a bad reason (what is with all the bad votes this game?). In your ISO38, you say Pie could replace TK, implying that you think TK is the least scummy of the three. Otherwise, Pie would replace the others. However, in your next post, you vote TK again! I really...In ISO39, he puts suspicion on TK/Umbrage/Pie/el simo/already had a scum read on ortiz. Too many, man.<br>\n(leaning scum)<br>\n<br>\n11. Thirdkoopa-No longer my biggest scum read. I don't like his reads, and I don't like many of his votes, but I don't feel like he's as scummy as other players in this game. TK is a strange player, and TK seems to be a big focus for most of my more scummy suspects, if that means anything/makes sense. The end of his ISO18 pretty much sums up how I feel, yet I can't help but feel like he's getting by easier doing the same thing (to a lesser degree, I guess). Okay, I'm done reading TK. WHAT IS THAT IN ISO22? \"Since I know now that people will still care, I'll argue the points I need to.\"??? That is my feeling exactly. Why did no one say anything about this when TK did, but they jump on me when I say it? I really don't know about this game, man.<br>\n(neutral)<br>\n<br>\n12. Fugitive- Hard for me to get a read. Influential player. Not saying this is scummy, but in his ISO15, it looks like he's using Pie's old meta. Like I tried to point out. Yet, I get a bunch of BS for it. That seems to be happening a lot, which I've discovered as I've done this post. He also says I'm playing my scum meta, which I'm not (I'm sure of that). Just pointing out that he's wrong. Uh...what else? I like the content he puts out, yet I don't like his vote on me. He even says that there is no original reasoning. I don't like this mentality of \"I DON'T <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">NECESSARILY</div> AGREE, BUT I WANT TO LYNCH SOMEBODY!!!!\" Overall, a neutral read.<br>\n(neutral)<br>\n<br>\nSummary:<br>\n<br>\nScum or leaning scum:<br>\nortiz<br>\nmaybe el simo<br>\nUmbrage<br>\nIP<br>\nCyberbob<br>\n<br>\nNeutral<br>\nmaybe el simo<br>\nchamber<br>\nTK<br>\nFugitive<br>\n<br>\nTown or leaning town<br>\nmaybe el simo &gt;_&gt;<br>\nTHAdmiral<br>\nFurcolow</div></blockquote>\n\nAND- <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: deadline extension</div> if we can still do that.

Furcolow- Claimed Miller, correct? The way he is acting makes me think he really is a Miller. Claiming Miller early in the game does have a town motivation, as it keeps investigative roles from investigating him. In fact, I did this same thing in the last game I played in (I WAS a Town Miller). Overall, seems like a solid town read to me. I like his content, such as ISO39 and ISO40 (the confident way in which he delivers it is giving me town vibes). However, the claim does make me want to keep an eye on him, just because of the nature of the claim.</div></blockquote>\n\nI know you were miller in SHM, so you feel claiming miller is townie, but you seem to base the town read simply off a miller claim. Don't you think scum would be claiming miller all the time if it made them look insta-town like that?

I haven&#8217;t been too involved in the game due to not a lot of arguments taking place around me, and as such my incentive to read has been a bit&#8230; low.  So I&#8217;m going to give my point of view via a recap of the entire thread, pointing out things which I thought were significant and giving my views.  This may be helpful to any replacees as well as explain my thoughts on the game thus far.<br>\n<br>\nIf anyone wants to do this as well, good on ya.<br>\n<br>\nConfirmation phase happens.  RVS goes on until Umbrage jokes about how he doesn&#8217;t RVS and how it&#8217;s scummy and how it&#8217;s scummy to point out how it&#8217;s scummy.  The notable vote on Umbrage is el simo&#8217;s.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>&#8221;el simo&#8221; wrote:</cite> I agree.<br>\n<br>\nOn a completely unrelated note I think I'll randomly Vote: Umbrage.</div></blockquote>\n\nUmbrage self-votes and Ortiz does as well.  Cyberbob votes for Ortiz, I ask him about it, and we get snippets between me and chamber as to the relevance of my question until Umbrage tells us that the snippets are distracting.  ThAdmiral brings up el simo&#8217;s supposedly &#8220;random&#8221; vote and calls Umbrage out for &#8220;mudslinging&#8221;.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>ThAdmiral wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Umbrage wrote:</cite>Anyway, my 'stifling discussion' post spawned more discussion than anything so far, so I'm calling it a success. The scummiest players so far are ThAdmiral and Cyberbob. They come in, vote un-randomly, and disappear. Don't like.<br>\n<br>\nOlinea and chamber have to stop the posting diarrhea.

Ortiz agrees with ThAdmiral.  Admiral pushes the case on el simo, who appears to defend himself by saying the vote was on a bandwagon to create discussion.  Umbrage votes for el simo.  El simo says:<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>el simo wrote:</cite>The vote was random, the target wasn't.</div></blockquote>\n\nCyberbob admits to active lurking.  I also notice a fair amount of mudslinging coming from him. Sorasgoof puts a vote on el simo and chamber votes Sorasgoof for being 4th on the wagon, claiming el simo&#8217;s reasoning is valid.  Oriz drops the el simo case, Umbrage and Admiral continue to push it.<br>\n<br>\nFurcolow drops in to make his first post on page 7.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Furcolow wrote:</cite>hi</div></blockquote>\n\nUmbrage calls him a &#8220;useless waste of space&#8221; causing a warning.<br>\n<br>\nFurcolow proceeds to vote for Ortiz before reading, claiming ties to el simo via an old Newbie game.  He validates el simo&#8217;s points before educating himself.  Furcolow discusses the old Newbie game in which el simo reportedly defended Furcolow who made a big fuss by claiming Cop D1 which led to el simo&#8217;s death N1.  chamber calls Umbrage&#8217;s pressure &#8220;transparently scum driven&#8221;.  Furcolow makes a long series of posts which noticeable target ThAdmiral as scum and defend el simo as town.  The series of posts cause diddin to tell Furcolow to stop spamming, leading to this.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Furcolow wrote:</cite>ive done that on my alt<br>\ni dont do that on this<br>\nthis is my VI account<br>\nget over it</div></blockquote>\n\nThis post causes a bit of confusion for some and is ignored by others.<br>\n<br>\nUmbrage, after noticing Furcolow has put ThAdmiral and himself on Furcolow&#8217;s scum list, pushes the lynch of Furcolow <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">and</div> el simo.  He calls Furcolow a &#8220;piece of shit&#8221; in response to the &#8220;VI account&#8221; statement for another warning.  TK returns and votes for Umbrage.<br>\n<br>\nInflatablePie replaces Nicodemus.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Cyberbob wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>el simo wrote:</cite>Yeah well check his record, he hasn't got away with it.</div></blockquote>\nGood.

He tells everyone to ISO ThirdKoopa but nobody sees the case on him.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>ortiz1193 wrote:</cite>Pie: Go ahead and give us the case on why TK is scum.

Cyberbob is unconvinced and still wants to policy lynch Furcolow until Cyberbob and el simo get into an argument about who&#8217;s been on the site longer and all that jazz.  Interrupted by InflatablePie and his case on ThirdKoopa.  Calls TK defensive in the beginning of the game, then trying to appear town, then fencesitting, then bandwagoning.  None of these arguments are fully developed and all appear to be isolated incidents.  Sorasgoof says InflatablePie is also trying to appear town.  Pie doesn&#8217;t care and says the Umbrage bandwagon is a horrible one.<br>\n<br>\nThis is through the bottom of Page 12, will continue later but I&#8217;m at a friend&#8217;s house so I can&#8217;t really finish this ISO without being extremely rude.", "time": "Thu Jan 06, 2011 4:16 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=15883&start=600", "forum": "53", "thread": "15883"}

I've been town with him. I've been scum with him. I've been on opposite alignments with him. I think I can read him very well. Pie is another one of those people I've played with a LOT and have had every combination of alignment with him (though our scum team failed &gt;_&gt; and his meta this game is nothing I've ever seen). oritz is not playing his scum meta. He's playing his town meta, in fact. Maybe I'm just off, but I think the fact that he's under so much suspicion actually points to a town oritz.<br>\n<br>\nNote: I re-read this before I posted and this paragraph I make it look like I'm more qualified to read oritz than anyone else. I'm really not trying to come across this way, I'm just trying to demonstrate my knowledge of his meta. <br>\n<br>\nThe main tell I ALWAYS use for him is caution vs. recklessness. The feeling I'm getting from oritz is that he doesn't care that people find him suspicious when he posts, which is usually a town-tell. A very big town-tell, I might add. Everyone should read his SHM5 game in his completed games. It was his most recent game. He was scum. He was extremely cautious all game. Dodging around reasons. Fence sitting. Playing safe. Now go find a town game, something which he hasn't played recently actually. He scum hunts like a pro. He's out there kicking ass and taking names. That's closer to what he's doing this game from what I've seen. I don't usually agree with his scum-tells, actually, but I see him as legitimately trying. <br>\n<br>\nThat's where I become conflicted, becuase I've seen him up to this point as sitting under the radar. When I read his posts though, I get the impression that he's really out there, they're just not very frequent and he doesn't garner much attention. My read on him really depends on whether or not I think he's trying to dodge the spotlight on purpose. If I had to go one way right now, I'd say it's not on purpose. When called out for lurking/under the radar-ing, he posts. That speaks volumes for me. I think it would be scummier to be called out then be afraid to post right after for being called out. <br>\n<br>\nOverall, I an NOT on board with an ortiz lynch. I have a town leaning read, plus I wasn't able to gain a single connection (besides the Pie/ortiz thing that was beaten to death and I think is too obvious to be a real connection) through the ISO.

Yeah, I know that's kind of lame, but his posting style is indicative of what I usually find to be town. Short, sweet, original ideas, kind of sarcastic but very set in his ways. Maybe I just haven't played mafia that much, but every time I see a scum flip it's usually a playstyle that's almost the exact opposite of that. I do wish he would elaborate a bit more, as I'm a fan of wordy posting (go figure) but that doesn't make him scum in my eyes. <br>\n<br>\n------<br>\n<br>\nStill exhausted but I forced myself to do this tonight when I got home because I'd been promising content for 2 days now, I think.

This is playing it safe because it builds a backdoor right into the vote. This vote as a way for him to draw attention to el simo's \"random vote\" without having to push a case. <br>\n- Later he casts suspicion on Ortiz and Pie, and both cases are lame. He unvotes as soon as this is pointed out to him. Next he decides to vote Ortiz for being wishy-washy, which is another lame case. Ortiz points this out to him and he unvotes again. <br>\n<br>\nThis feels to me as though he doesn't really believe that the people he is building cases against are scum because he is happy to let them off once they explain themselves to him.<br>\n<br>\nHe mudslings:<br>\n- He accuses chamber of playing coy, which I think is mudslinging considering that it was completely unnecessary since chamber had already provided reasons for his vote. <br>\n- He accuses Umbrage of backtracking regarding how fast he wants people to post. This is another example of mudslinging because there is no scum motivation for what Umbrage did that I can think of. <br>\n<br>\nAlso, as Furcolow has already pointed out, he later \"This's\" the post of someone he thinks is scum, who is attacking someone who he just unvoted, and who he is about to vote again. To me this shows a lack of sincerity in his vote and unvote on el simo and his vote on Umbrage.<br>\n<br>\nI'd like to address the following two posts specifically.<br>\n<br>\nISO12:<br>\nHe says that there is a discrepancy between what el simo is saying and what he has done. I think this choice of words was designed to paint el simo as scummy, when asked to explain what the discrepancy is he says that he thinks el simo made a random or jokey vote, copped heat for it and that he is now trying to explain his way out of it. I think this is exactly what is happening, but there is no discrepancy. <br>\n<br>\nHe also says that he thinks el simo \"was backed into the corner by an early vote,\" which is a bizarre attack because el simo is free to change his vote and doesn't really have to justify it.<br>\n<br>\nHe suggests el simo is scummy for posting five times in a row, which is more mudslinging.<br>\n<br>\nISO17 (Post 308): <br>\nPro-town fluff: \"I don't believe playing out the rvs for the rvs's sake is good play.

I felt like we had a nice brolliance like ReaperCharlie tries to create in certain games.</div></blockquote>\n\nYet, from Newbie 1002,<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>el simo wrote:</cite>A cop claim is very easy to produce and very easy to cover. \"A didn't get an investigation last night I was role blocked,\" or \"Maddie is a townsman.\" I've claimed cop as scum before and we won the game because of it.<br>\n<br>\nMaddie you state his claim makes no sense, but he is trying to lynch players because of poor grammar. He has consistently made no sense this in entire thread, why does his bogus cop claim any different?</div></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>el simo wrote:</cite>I'm incredibly against the idea of a policy lynch, but I do believe we have found our scum, either that or an unbelievably inept townsman. He is not the cop.</div></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>el simo wrote:</cite>Furcolow<br>\nPlaying much more aggressively than he has in his other games, using probably much worse logic too. Had a really bad claim and has been incredibly bigoted, how ever his play has been improving as of lately. I really want to lynch him (because I do think he is scummy) but I'd much rather give him time to prove his claim.</div></blockquote>\n\nOf course, later on we get this:<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>el simo wrote:</cite>I'm not saying that he is a townie, or the cop or even scum, because at this point it is too hard to say. He's claimed cop and he deserves a chance to prove his claim. I'm not asking to keep him in the game and not lynch at all, but rather just to postpone it until we have more information.</div></blockquote>\n\nBut that&#8217;s not so much &#8220;defending&#8221; as it is &#8220;dropping the case on Furcolow&#8221;.<br>\n<br>\nAlso, of note, your posting style is in very frequent snippets as it is now, although I would attribute that to the fact that you were under extreme pressure.  I have no idea how you play scum, and perhaps that&#8217;s a posting style that isn&#8217;t variable based on alignment.<br>\n<br>\nSo:<br>\nWhy do you say el simo defended you in that game and you had a good partnership when he criticized you and called you scummy for a much larger portion of the game than the period where he ignored you (note that I couldn&#8217;t find any point in which he decisively gives a town read on you)?", "time": "Sun Jan 09, 2011 8:42 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=15883&start=650", "forum": "53", "thread": "15883"}

That's a very best case scenario 8:3:1. You're really calling a 2:1 town to anti-town ratio with multiple kills per night? I'm not sure if this is a scum slip and you know there's a 3 man team and the setup really is that crooked or you're town and just off your rocker. I would say the setup is almost guaranteed 9:2:1 at this point, otherwise it's completely and utterly unbalanced toward anti-town forces. <br>\n<br>\nThen don't get me started how lumping me into a scumteam based on other people's reads when we don't even have a scum flip yet is just absurd in itself. <br>\n<br>\nI really REALLY don't like this post, but I don't even think it's scummy, it's just not good. <br>\n<br>\nOnto my reads:<br>\n<br>\nLooks like my CB read was shot to hell, but it sorta makes sense to try to make yourself a little scummy as a BG. And now 3 of my scum reads flip town and I'm doing something wrong. I'm going to reread the thread tomorrow and look at Pie's VCA to try to start reads over from scratch with knowledge of soras, 3k, and CB town. Also want to hear everyone weigh in on the two kills. I still think I can't be wrong on every read though, so process of elimination says Furc is VERY likely scum. Umbrage/Z was the other scum read that was left. Everybody else here was town/neutral, which I'm pretty obviously wrong on at least one of them. I can almost guarantee one of the furc/Z is scum. I'll be looking into those two the most heavily, and from a brief pass over the VCA I don't like Umbrage's votes. Lastly, Ad is looking scummier when more pressure is applied, I'm not so confident in that town read anymore, but I'll delve deeper into that tomorrow.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Pie wrote:</cite>He agrees on Zdenek, calls me suspicious, but then votes oritz.

I have never seen a situation where a no lynch should even be considered unless it's guaranteed MYLO, and even then, lynching is probably a good idea since there is a better town:scum ratio. I don't like that at all. If the setup is a vig and 3 scum then the vig can no shoot in the case of a mislynch. No lynch = terrible. <br>\n<br>\nThen Z comes out (see, I'm glad I waited for everyone to post) with absolutely no real content and a post entirely speculative, then pushed a no lynch despite saying his vote would be on someone who's very likely to get lynched.

I'm getting a cautious, knows-too-much, scum-vibe from that post.

I have a hard time believing Admiral would push a case that soon on a fellow scumbuddy, especially if they were a scum PR.

I explained my read in that snippet of the post, so I'm not sure what's left to explain. I guess you're searching for some explanation on my part since he flipped scum? I was wrong, that's about all there is to it, though he was admittedly much scummier Day 2 and his VCA was really bad, I still never had a scum read on him. <br>\n<br>\n2nd one: I think Umbrage voting Furc was a bus.

There's always a way to defend your actions without rolling over, giving up and saying \"well all I can do is WIFOM.\" Even the WIFOM defense wasn't really good. It's not much of a bus when you know the person cannot be lynched. It was a safe vote all day, and one that I'm now convinced was there to make you look more town, because that WIFOM defense you pulled out about how you wouldn't bus a buddy Day 1 was crap and you know it. <br>\n<br>\nWhy did you suddenly change your mind on Day 2 from NLing to voting Thad?

I&#8217;ll kick it off.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Claim: Town Gunsmith</div><br>\n<br>\nTo be honest, I have no idea how I&#8217;m still alive.  My post on D3 detailing my reads was my biggest slip ever and I spent 3 days convinced I would die.  I posted about a <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Godfather</div> which, after looking at a few Mini Normal setups, seems like a guess that none other than a PR would make.<br>\n<br>\nNight 1 I investigated <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Cyberbob</div> due to his astoundingly unreadable (but mostly anti-town, not so much <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">scummy</div>) play.  I was under the impression that no Mafia member would kill Cyberbob due to the fact that a lynch could be made on him so easily.  Well, you all saw his flip &#8211; diddin was nice enough to tell me that Cyberbob had no gun, but fat lot of good that&#8217;s doing us now.<br>\n<br>\nDuring the day I flip-flopped on the possibility of SK vs. Vigilante.  I figured since Serial Killers generally work with knives then it&#8217;d be a way for an SK to remain investigation-immune (Unlike a certain SK I knew =_=).  Of course, the lack of stabbing flavor should have tipped me off in the first place, plus the fact that a lack of a Vigilante would dampen the thing that differs a Gunsmith from a regular Cop.<br>\n<br>\nNight 2 I investigated <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Fugitive</div> as he, too, was unreadable.  He&#8217;s an aggressive sort of player as Town, I don&#8217;t know much about scum Fugitive but knowing him as a notoriously good player as both scum and Town I figured it&#8217;d settle any sort of doubts I had about him.  Fugitive returned with no gun, and I crumbed it in my list.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Olinea wrote:</cite><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Fugitive</div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">N</div>o idea what to think of this.  <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">O</div>riginally I thought one of Fugi/Pie but I think that was mostly me trying to <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">appear</div> experienced.  <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">G</div>ot a Town read on him early on (I know most everybody does) and I haven't seen anything that makes me want to change that.  <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">U</div>sually I find out that my scumreads are always Town and the scum are who I least suspect but it appears ThAdmiral takes that spot so this leaves me the tiniest bit more confident in town Fugi.  <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">N</div>ot going to abandon any moderate reads in favor of him.</div></blockquote>\n\nFor those of you playing at home, that spells N-O   G-U-N.<br>\n<br>\nI thought Fugitive MIGHT be a Godfather, hence my statement being ambiguous enough to suggest that I would actually consider lynching him, but today I learned that Godfathers return &#8220;no result&#8221; from Gunsmiths so at this point I&#8217;d consider Fugitive clear from my point of view unless he&#8217;s some sort of insane Serial Killer who didn&#8217;t kill anyone for three nights.<br>\n<br>\nAfter my list that pretty much SCREAMED Power Role (at least I thought so), I figured I was likely dying, but I investigated <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Baby Spice</div> as I was sold on Ortiz but I just couldn&#8217;t bring myself to think of a scum Furcolow in this game.  I got no result, so I think I was blocked last night.<br>\n<br>\nRight now Ortiz is my number one read.  I think his metas completely contrast mine.  I think I doubt myself a LOT as Town and when I&#8217;m scum (only in short little games, not actual forum games, so I don&#8217;t know how accurate I am on this) I push WAY hard on people and try to act like a Town leader.  Ortiz seems to be very self-deprecating when he&#8217;s scum, stuff like &#8220;Geez I can&#8217;t believe I was wrong&#8221; or lots of those smiley faces that go :/ (I noticed quite a few of them in SHM5) but when I read SHMWT where he was a Doctor he appeared to take a very pro-town stance, almost as a leader, trying to get everyone involved and active.  In that regard, while meta has always failed me in the past, I think I&#8217;ve got a successful meta argument here (inb4 meta is useless, I get it) and I can go re-read him except all of my ISOs on players I find scummy just turn into tunnel vision walls.<br>\n<br>\nPREVIEW EDIT: Diddin&#8217;s PM to me was delayed.  Baby Spice has no gun so at this point I&#8217;m almost sold on an Ortiz/Furcolow scumteam.  I'd still like everyone else to claim but this is what I've got and I'd like to get this on the table since I don't think I'll be doing anything but Chemistry and Physics for the remainder of the night.", "time": "Mon Jan 24, 2011 5:57 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=15883&start=800", "forum": "53", "thread": "15883"}
