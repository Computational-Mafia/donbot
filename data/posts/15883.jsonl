At least they were until the Mafia came into town. The first night, the town mayor was found face down in the same river they lived on, a single bullet in his brain. That was when the town decided to destroy the Mafia at any cost.

You may vote for a no lynch if you want, which only requires 50% of the players.<br>4. Make sure I know who you are talking about if you use nicknames.<br>5. Each day will have a 3 week time limit. The deadline may be extended, but only for replacements.<br>6. A lynch is reached after a majority of votes are on one player. During twilight, everyone may talk except for the lynched player.<br>7. Each Night will be 72 Hours long. Any action not sent to me by then will not be accepted.<br>8. If there is not a majority at deadline, there will be a no lynch.<br><br>Activity:<br>1.

I'm not. I pointed this out in my vote post. He misrepresented the facts and specifically used a word to make his case look bigger than it is. I did it once, he incorrectly claimed I did it repeatedly. This is a lie, lying is scummy, to claim I am voting him mainly because he is voting me is to completely ignore and disregard the posts where I prove that he is wrong.<br><br>Also, despite what you might believe, OMGUS isn't a scum tell, or a town tell, it's a null tell. It is more indicative of your level of experience than your alignment in game.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Umbrage wrote:</cite>CONCLUSION: We have a player that disguises his reasons for voting, denies any deception even when it's been clearly pointed out, and attacks a player that made a case on him.

But that still doesn't make sense: you don't decide the aim of a vote after you decide to vote. We, as human beings, don't act without a reason.

The first question posed to you concerned why you voted on a bandwagon but said it was random. You could've just admitted you lied about it being random to get a bandwagon. That's more or less what you're saying now: that vote was to get a bandwagon going and lead us out of RVS. Which is fine. But you refused to admit that you lied, or made a mistake, or used ambiguous grammar, or whatever concerning the random part. Basically, you keep saying that this misunderstanding is ALL OUR FAULT and you are NOT TO BLAME AT ALL. Which is a total overreaction. The worst you could have been accused of is trying to end RVS early or using a poor choice of words, neither of which are proper tells. You seem VERY concerned with keeping your reputation in this game as clean as possible, which doesn't make sense unless you have something to hide.<br><br>3.

Umbrage there are those two questions but that doesn't take out the three decisions you make while you vote. No matter how you do it you still have to decide if you are going to vote, who you are going to vote and how serious it is, I'll give you that order doesn't matter, but you still make those three decisions. There is no skipping it. It doesn't make sense that vote someone you want to lynch with out having decided who it is, you don't target someone you find very suspicious with out deciding whether he warrants a vote or not. These decisions have to be there otherwise it doesn't make sense. At best you can skip the seriousness of it but that isn't recommended for good town play.<br><br>2. I'm over reacting?

First off, thanks Pie for actually getting us going (imo).  Looking back on it, Umbrage and El Simo both look town (or atleast not scum) and the votes on them came from our lack of anything else to go on.<br><br>-Pie is coming off very town.  Pretty sure, but he could be messing with his meta because I think I caught him in our last game together (F&amp;I), and Fugi is getting a good grasp on his scum meta too.  <br><br>-I don't think TK is scum.  I can see a few scummy things he's done, but he just comes off as having an r2r meta to me (the one where r2r lacks the ability to make a decision on Day 1 so people always call him scum for it).  I guess I wouldn't be surprised if he flipped scum, but I just don't think he is, and definitely not worth a vote.  Someone said something earlier along the lines of \"town being made scummy\" and I think that could be happening here.  I stand by the scummiest thing he did was unvoting as soon as he got called out.<br><br>-I'm still suspicious of Soras, mainly because of his posts involving Pie.  <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Soras wrote:</cite>This whole group thing and the huge posts seem like very over the top ways of trying to make yourself look town, Pie.</div></blockquote><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Soras wrote:</cite>@Olinea, Pie: This is the same thing Pie did in GHM1, if I remember correctly. I'm not saying he's scum here, but everyone went along with what he said in GHM1, and the town lost because of it (his mafia team did too, but that's not the point <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\">).

The first thing I thought was chainsaw, but that would require TK being scum, and then he voted TK in the next post so idk.  I still don't like it.  <br><br>Also, I don't like his reactions to suspicion being placed on him.  His reactions to Chamber early in the game, the last vote on him, and my post just don't read well to me.  He just comes off overly hostile in those posts.  <br><br>+I think TK is the second wagon he jumped on (I think he was on one earlier when chamber voted for him), which isn't necessarily a scumtell, but still worth mentioning.  <br><br>That is the reasoning behind soras being second on my scumlist.  <br><br>--<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">unvote, vote CyberBob</span><br><br>You think TK got away with a lot?

When I voted 3K, I got some support, 3K got riled up a bit, but a quite a few players ignored me or posted one or two sentences.. I think pretty much every player has commented on my switch to soras now, and a few have found it scummy. soras switch to 3K didn't sit right with me. Admittedly, my case on 3K was weak - the only thing to come out of it was a rise in his activity level and his unvote, which is scummy, yes. But... here's where I have to concede. 3K is looking less scummy the more I read his posts. I still want 3K dead at some point soon, but he's posting decent content. I don't mind keeping him alive for today, yet I'll still hammer his wagon if it builds to that point. Especially if, with lack of pressure, his activity level drops. If he is scum, now he has to keep posting at a decent rate because I called him out for lurking, which means more chances for him to slip. If he's town, I helped motivate him to help the town. It's a win/win situation right now.<br><br>Soras' death will give us more information, and his reaction to pressure is pretty bad to boot, what with the OMGUS-y attitude of him casting suspicion on anyone who suspects him."}

He votes people for policy and doesn't scumhunt for half the game. And he also complains about the players. A lot. He's improved a bit, but not much.

He also blatantly copied Olinea's case on ortiz. But these are the scummiest things he's done. CONCLUSION: Needs to be more active. It's hard to get a good read on him.

His posts confuse the game more than anything. It's hard to put my finger on it, but there's something about his style of play that is deliberately anti-town.<br><br>Furcolow: Knows he's a VI, yet doesn't try to improve his play. Jesus. Does anyone here take him seriously? And WHAT is with the constant buddying to el simo? Am I the only one who's seeing this? CONCLUSION: Scum if el simo is scum.<br><br>el simo: Reads as frustrated town, or more likely, impatient scum. Buddies with Furcolow, they defend each other whenever one comes under suspicion. CONCLUSION: Since I appear to be the only player that still finds him scummy, I'll let it drop, but do me a favour and read over him and Furcolow. I see a TON of buddying and coaching going on.<br><br>InflatablePie: Very aggressive, but not in a scummy way. Doesn't vote without a series of reasons explaining why. The only thing I don't like is the switch from 3K to soras. Appears to be trying to buddy me. CONCLUSION: No reason to think he's scum now, we need more information of alignment.

No obvious bandwagoning, or tunneling, or any of the usual tells. CONCLUSION: Probably the person I suspect the least. Therefore, I suspect him.<br><br>Thirdkoopa: Plays Civ IV too much. Honestly, I don't get much of a scum vibe from his posts. CONCLUSION: Call it gut if you want, but I think he's town.<br><br>TheLonging: All his posts have been bullshit so far, I look forward to some content from his replacement.

I'm not going to go back and take a million quotes, because that's close to how many there are, but it's mostly about his gameplay. He's playing a very OMGUS style, people suspicious of him garner his suspicion back. Then awhile ago when he claimed a VI account that set off some major alarms, but that seems to have been covered to death. I'm not going to let it go though. I still can't see a town member actually claiming to be a VI account simply because they've caught some suspicion. And notice how the posting dropped off after the VI claim. Seems to be a common scum tactic to fly under the radar like that as well. The \"content\" that he posts is sketchy at best. Seems to be to be full of fake scum-tells and filler material. Example:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Furcolow wrote:</cite>I'm going to be busy tomorrow<br>moving my placeholder vote, because cyberbob is probably town (yes, i know what a placeholder vote is!)<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">unvote: cyberbob</span><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: umbrage</span><br>I feel like his posting is too-defensive and is forced</div></blockquote><br><br>Defensive? How is he supposed to talk to people who are suspicious of him? By not defending himself. Forced? Saying something feels forced is usually a load of shit and usually seems to be a scum-tell used by scum to fake gut reads on people. And I can bet he'll defend those reasons by saying it's just a placeholder, but even placeholder votes need good reasons. There's no town motivation for using bad reasons for any vote.<br><br>If completely necessary, I can do a post-by-post, but just ISO him and you'll see what I'm talking about. Then he seems to fly back under the radar with intervals of non-posting."}

Two for the price of one.<br><br>I'd also like to state my distaste for the way we're heading. I believe it was Fugitive who said 'whoever posts the least is the scummiest'. Some good cases have been made on ortiz, el simo, and myself, yet none of us appear to be a valid lynch option. In my opinion, the scum are likely very active posters and thinkers in this game and are trying to steer attention toward the ones who aren't as active. I don't like how wagons grew so quickly on ThirdKoopa and sorasgoof. I'm surprised nobody has suggested I'm scum with TK, because if I was, I couldn't have done a better job of redirecting everyone's attention to soras and saving my partner. It seems there are some players who are untouchable in this game, which is a very unhealthy arrangement."}

Just look at SHM5. I don't think it's notable. Especially around this time of year. He should be posting more though. Furcolow was notable because his posting was consistent until suspicion, then dropped without a word about why. That's not the main reason I'm suspicious of him though, so I'd rather not blow it out of proportion. It's convenient, yes, but as I said this time of year is a bit hectic, so my other reasons for why he's scum are much more important to me. <br><br>soras, as you can see by my reads, is already a large suspect of mine. I think el simo's recent post about his votes is really quite telling. I'm not really getting the OMGUS vibe so much from him though. I think he's more following than anything, I don't see him turning around on people that are suspicious of him simply because they're suspicious of him."}

If 3K is scum, so is Umbrage, but it's completely possible that Umbrage is scum without 3K being scum.

I don't even know that he's posted since I replaced in and he's not even being considered as scum by anyone because of the inactivity. Granted, I don't think he's scum from what I read early on, but he still needs to post. <br><br>On a side note, I think we have 3 players that have just given up. That's pretty absurd and entirely annoying to sign up for a mafia game where 1/4 of the players don't even care about playing mafia. I'd expect this on an off site game, but on Mafiascum? You guys should replace out or something."}

This is actually the first time I've ever done anything like this, so I'm sure some parts of it are not going to make sense and could perhaps contradict itself. Ask questions, and I will do my best to explain.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>1. ortiz1193- Was a fairly neutral read until his last post, now a large scum suspect. <br>(Scum)<br><br>2. el simo- Don't necessarily agree with his points of view/don't really like the way we've been interacting. However, he kept his composure during that whole \"random\" thing, and after an explanation, I don't think he's necessarily scummy.<br>-Question: Why do you think my unvote on you is scummy? You used it as part of your case on me (or at least as part of your vote), but in your ISO27, you said you felt comfortable with an unvote on Ortiz because you felt like he understood you. I finally understood you, and my unvote earned me suspicion? What the fu...<br>-Just noting a connection between Furcolow and el simo. NOT SAYING THIS IS NECESSARILY SCUMMY.<br>-WOW. Everyone read el simo's ISO51. Does that not sound EXACTLY LIKE ME? Except he's defending Furcolow for it? I don't even...His ISO63 is much the same.<br>-Seems very interested in TK..<br>(Anywhere from leaning town to leaning scum, actually. Hard for me to get a read at this point).<br><br>3. ThAdmiral- I don't remember anybody saying anything about THAdmiral, actually. I'm getting townish vibes from him, and no, not just because he said he thinks I'm town. Maybe it's just the fact that he needs to post more; the town read isn't solid, and I'd need to see more from him to lean far in either direction.<br>(Neutral leaning town)<br><br>4. Furcolow- Claimed Miller, correct? The way he is acting makes me think he really is a Miller. Claiming Miller early in the game does have a town motivation, as it keeps investigative roles from investigating him. In fact, I did this same thing in the last game I played in (I WAS a Town Miller). Overall, seems like a solid town read to me. I like his content, such as ISO39 and ISO40 (the confident way in which he delivers it is giving me town vibes). However, the claim does make me want to keep an eye on him, just because of the nature of the claim.<br>(Town)<br><br>5. Umbrage- Boy, where do I even begin? Extremely hostile for no real reason. I never have liked his completely horrible case on el simo in his ISO9. I also very much dislike his ISO23. That reaction is awful. Also, what was that about a Mason claim? Where did that come from? I don't like that, either. Connection between Cyberbob and Umbrage established in ISO24. ISO25: Detached? What does that even mean? Like, not caring? ISO26: You don't care to play with people \"spouting off slurs?\" Oh, like you? &gt;_&gt; *Not part of my read, just annoying* ISO29: Hahahahah. Ha. *Not part of my read* ISO31: Misrepping me all the way. I had no intention of anything you said. Then, in your next post, you say that wagoning is fine, while wagoning without reasoning is not. You were suspicious of me because I \"wagoned\" TK, even though I gave reasoning. Therefore, my \"wagon\" should have been okay. Also, I don't like your read on Cyberbob in ISO34. You said he was the most town player in the game, yet you wouldn't weep at his lynch? What the I don't even... Then there's the whole voting Fugitive despite thinking he softclaimed. That doesn't make any sense whatsoever. You're voting someone who you think is trying to softclaim? Okay. In your ISO38, you say you would most like to lynch Furcolow, despite all the stuff you did with me in your previous posts. Literally seven hours before, you liked where your vote was on me, then you say you want to lynch Furcolow (yet you DON't move your vote). THEN, after being sort of called out by Pie over the Fugitive softclaim thing, you vote Fugitive. I REALLY do not like this part AT ALL. That was an AWFUL vote. Woooow. ISO45 has you moving your vote to Furcolow. This is so...okay. After all of this, you still don't have your vote on me. Why? You still think I'm scum, yet your vote is on Furcolow.<br>(SCUM)<br><br>6. chamber-bad vote on me in ISO17 (I feel like it was a bad vote because he Voted me because I was the fourth on the wagon). Up until this point, I had a feeling that his posts didn't really have any content at all, despite what he says. He hasn't posted enough for a great read, like THAdmiral. I'm getting an \"airy\" feel from his posts, if that makes sense.<br>(neutral)<br><br>8. InflatablePie- I hate the groups thing. I don't see a connection between most of those groups. What I REALLY don't like about IP is the way he says he's 100% positive on TK and moves his vote to me without any clear new reasoning/content. He commends Umbrage on his reasoning, and it looks like he blatantly bandwagons. Then, Pie says how he is becoming unsure on TK. I thought you were 100%? I'm starting to see a connection between IP and Fugi, also. I'll show you the examples of that if you ask for it. I want to get this whole thing over with tonight. ISO33: I DO care if people find me scummy, actually. I WANT to win, and when I feel people are voting reasons I feel are unjustified, I get bitter. ISO36: Woah, back to TK. So, you were 100% on TK, you move to me after bandwagoning with Umbrage, you say you had a bad (or at least lackluster) case on TK, then you move back to TK. You say it's because you're feeling worse about Umbrage, but I don't know if I buy that. This whole situation with Umbrage, you, TK, and me is scummy, in my opinion. THEN HE VOTES UMBRAGE. I don't get it! WHO ARE YOU MOST SUSPICIOUS OF? Somehow, I jump back above Umbrage even though I wasn't doing anything differently than before, and now TK is only an FoS. I'm genuinely confused.<br>(leaning scum to scum)<br><br>9. Olinea-I'm feeling him as town, as well, though he was been completely flying under the radar. I think Olinea is one of the only players who hasn't had any suspicion placed upon him. I like his content, especially concerning TK and Umbrage<br><br>10. Cyberbob- I can't believe no one has said anything about his ISO24. What is with those reads? Then there's a bad vote on Thirdkoopa. A BLATANT bandwagon. \"duck duck duck duck duck duck goose Unvote, Vote: Thirdkoopa\" REALLY? It looks like you think Umbrage and ortiz are scummier, yet you vote TK, presumably because that was the biggest wagon at the time. I mean, come on. Your ISO38 is where I get confused, really. You say you still think the scum team is Ortiz/TK/Umbrage. Okay. Well, you voted Furcolow in your last vote post, for a bad reason (what is with all the bad votes this game?). In your ISO38, you say Pie could replace TK, implying that you think TK is the least scummy of the three. Otherwise, Pie would replace the others. However, in your next post, you vote TK again! I really...In ISO39, he puts suspicion on TK/Umbrage/Pie/el simo/already had a scum read on ortiz. Too many, man.<br>(leaning scum)<br><br>11. Thirdkoopa-No longer my biggest scum read. I don't like his reads, and I don't like many of his votes, but I don't feel like he's as scummy as other players in this game. TK is a strange player, and TK seems to be a big focus for most of my more scummy suspects, if that means anything/makes sense. The end of his ISO18 pretty much sums up how I feel, yet I can't help but feel like he's getting by easier doing the same thing (to a lesser degree, I guess). Okay, I'm done reading TK. WHAT IS THAT IN ISO22? \"Since I know now that people will still care, I'll argue the points I need to.\"??? That is my feeling exactly. Why did no one say anything about this when TK did, but they jump on me when I say it? I really don't know about this game, man.<br>(neutral)<br><br>12. Fugitive- Hard for me to get a read. Influential player. Not saying this is scummy, but in his ISO15, it looks like he's using Pie's old meta. Like I tried to point out. Yet, I get a bunch of BS for it. That seems to be happening a lot, which I've discovered as I've done this post. He also says I'm playing my scum meta, which I'm not (I'm sure of that). Just pointing out that he's wrong. Uh...what else? I like the content he puts out, yet I don't like his vote on me. He even says that there is no original reasoning. I don't like this mentality of \"I DON'T <span style=\"font-style: italic\">NECESSARILY</span> AGREE, BUT I WANT TO LYNCH SOMEBODY!!!!\" Overall, a neutral read.<br>(neutral)<br><br>Summary:<br><br>Scum or leaning scum:<br>ortiz<br>maybe el simo<br>Umbrage<br>IP<br>Cyberbob<br><br>Neutral<br>maybe el simo<br>chamber<br>TK<br>Fugitive<br><br>Town or leaning town<br>maybe el simo &gt;_&gt;<br>THAdmiral<br>Furcolow</div></blockquote><br><br>AND- <span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: deadline extension</span> if we can still do that.

El simo says:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>el simo wrote:</cite>The vote was random, the target wasn't.</div></blockquote><br><br>Cyberbob admits to active lurking.  I also notice a fair amount of mudslinging coming from him. Sorasgoof puts a vote on el simo and chamber votes Sorasgoof for being 4th on the wagon, claiming el simo\u2019s reasoning is valid.  Oriz drops the el simo case, Umbrage and Admiral continue to push it.<br><br>Furcolow drops in to make his first post on page 7.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Furcolow wrote:</cite>hi</div></blockquote><br><br>Umbrage calls him a \u201cuseless waste of space\u201d causing a warning.<br><br>Furcolow proceeds to vote for Ortiz before reading, claiming ties to el simo via an old Newbie game.

Furcolow discusses the old Newbie game in which el simo reportedly defended Furcolow who made a big fuss by claiming Cop D1 which led to el simo\u2019s death N1.  chamber calls Umbrage\u2019s pressure \u201ctransparently scum driven\u201d.  Furcolow makes a long series of posts which noticeable target ThAdmiral as scum and defend el simo as town.  The series of posts cause diddin to tell Furcolow to stop spamming, leading to this.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Furcolow wrote:</cite>ive done that on my alt<br>i dont do that on this<br>this is my VI account<br>get over it</div></blockquote><br><br>This post causes a bit of confusion for some and is ignored by others.<br><br>Umbrage, after noticing Furcolow has put ThAdmiral and himself on Furcolow\u2019s scum list, pushes the lynch of Furcolow <span style=\"font-style: italic\">and</span> el simo.  He calls Furcolow a \u201cpiece of shit\u201d in response to the \u201cVI account\u201d statement for another warning.

Interrupted by InflatablePie and his case on ThirdKoopa.  Calls TK defensive in the beginning of the game, then trying to appear town, then fencesitting, then bandwagoning.  None of these arguments are fully developed and all appear to be isolated incidents.  Sorasgoof says InflatablePie is also trying to appear town.  Pie doesn\u2019t care and says the Umbrage bandwagon is a horrible one.<br><br>This is through the bottom of Page 12, will continue later but I\u2019m at a friend\u2019s house so I can\u2019t really finish this ISO without being extremely rude."}

I think that's a good reason to read a player over.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Furcolow wrote:</cite>What are your thoughts on me not voting ortiz, and forcing two competing wagons, which was then offset</div></blockquote><br><br>This question confuses me kind of. I don't really have an opinion on you not voting ortiz, but the fact that you asked me about it makes me a little suspicious because it seems like you're trying really hard to point to the fact that you're not wagoning which seems like you're trying too hard.<br><br>-------<br><br>ortiz's ISO:<br><br>oritz is someone I've played with a lot now. I've been town with him. I've been scum with him. I've been on opposite alignments with him. I think I can read him very well. Pie is another one of those people I've played with a LOT and have had every combination of alignment with him (though our scum team failed &gt;_&gt; and his meta this game is nothing I've ever seen). oritz is not playing his scum meta. He's playing his town meta, in fact. Maybe I'm just off, but I think the fact that he's under so much suspicion actually points to a town oritz.<br><br>Note: I re-read this before I posted and this paragraph I make it look like I'm more qualified to read oritz than anyone else. I'm really not trying to come across this way, I'm just trying to demonstrate my knowledge of his meta. <br><br>The main tell I ALWAYS use for him is caution vs. recklessness. The feeling I'm getting from oritz is that he doesn't care that people find him suspicious when he posts, which is usually a town-tell. A very big town-tell, I might add. Everyone should read his SHM5 game in his completed games. It was his most recent game. He was scum. He was extremely cautious all game. Dodging around reasons. Fence sitting. Playing safe. Now go find a town game, something which he hasn't played recently actually. He scum hunts like a pro. He's out there kicking ass and taking names. That's closer to what he's doing this game from what I've seen. I don't usually agree with his scum-tells, actually, but I see him as legitimately trying. <br><br>That's where I become conflicted, becuase I've seen him up to this point as sitting under the radar. When I read his posts though, I get the impression that he's really out there, they're just not very frequent and he doesn't garner much attention. My read on him really depends on whether or not I think he's trying to dodge the spotlight on purpose. If I had to go one way right now, I'd say it's not on purpose. When called out for lurking/under the radar-ing, he posts. That speaks volumes for me. I think it would be scummier to be called out then be afraid to post right after for being called out. <br><br>Overall, I an NOT on board with an ortiz lynch. I have a town leaning read, plus I wasn't able to gain a single connection (besides the Pie/ortiz thing that was beaten to death and I think is too obvious to be a real connection) through the ISO. I don't think much information could be gained from his lynch<br><br>-------<br><br>@Z - mind if I call you that?<br><br>I have a town read on Admiral mostly for gut. Yeah, I know that's kind of lame, but his posting style is indicative of what I usually find to be town. Short, sweet, original ideas, kind of sarcastic but very set in his ways. Maybe I just haven't played mafia that much, but every time I see a scum flip it's usually a playstyle that's almost the exact opposite of that. I do wish he would elaborate a bit more, as I'm a fan of wordy posting (go figure) but that doesn't make him scum in my eyes. <br><br>------<br><br>Still exhausted but I forced myself to do this tonight when I got home because I'd been promising content for 2 days now, I think. If there's anything I missed addressed to me or any questions let me know and I'll try to get to it by the day after tomorrow."}

It appears to me that el simo took almost no initiative in defending your D1 Cop claim and you clung to the Cop claim as evidence of the fact that you were confirmed town despite the chance of a Goon-Goon-Doc-6 VTs setup which would mean no Cop Counterclaim.  Yet you claim that simo helped you out in that game.  <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Furcolow wrote:</cite>the fact you died in that newbie game was like *facepalm* for me, because you were the only person who really was actively defending the fact that I was a detective. I was really, really upset about it because in extended mafia games I have only been a detective 3-4 times, and every single time something happens that severely messes with me. In that newbie game it was an early wagon. Hell, I believe it was even you that was like OMG HE'S AT L-2 or something similar when I was really at L-3 or L-4 which I found scummily motivated. For some reason, though, I ended up not taking your buddying to be town and I trusted you wholeheartedly. I felt like we had a nice brolliance like ReaperCharlie tries to create in certain games.</div></blockquote><br><br>Yet, from Newbie 1002,<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>el simo wrote:</cite>A cop claim is very easy to produce and very easy to cover. \"A didn't get an investigation last night I was role blocked,\" or \"Maddie is a townsman.\" I've claimed cop as scum before and we won the game because of it.<br><br>Maddie you state his claim makes no sense, but he is trying to lynch players because of poor grammar. He has consistently made no sense this in entire thread, why does his bogus cop claim any different?</div></blockquote><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>el simo wrote:</cite>I'm incredibly against the idea of a policy lynch, but I do believe we have found our scum, either that or an unbelievably inept townsman. He is not the cop.</div></blockquote><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>el simo wrote:</cite>Furcolow<br>Playing much more aggressively than he has in his other games, using probably much worse logic too. Had a really bad claim and has been incredibly bigoted, how ever his play has been improving as of lately. I really want to lynch him (because I do think he is scummy) but I'd much rather give him time to prove his claim.</div></blockquote><br><br>Of course, later on we get this:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>el simo wrote:</cite>I'm not saying that he is a townie, or the cop or even scum, because at this point it is too hard to say. He's claimed cop and he deserves a chance to prove his claim. I'm not asking to keep him in the game and not lynch at all, but rather just to postpone it until we have more information.</div></blockquote><br><br>But that\u2019s not so much \u201cdefending\u201d as it is \u201cdropping the case on Furcolow\u201d.<br><br>Also, of note, your posting style is in very frequent snippets as it is now, although I would attribute that to the fact that you were under extreme pressure.  I have no idea how you play scum, and perhaps that\u2019s a posting style that isn\u2019t variable based on alignment.<br><br>So:<br>Why do you say el simo defended you in that game and you had a good partnership when he criticized you and called you scummy for a much larger portion of the game than the period where he ignored you (note that I couldn\u2019t find any point in which he decisively gives a town read on you)?"}

That's a very best case scenario 8:3:1. You're really calling a 2:1 town to anti-town ratio with multiple kills per night? I'm not sure if this is a scum slip and you know there's a 3 man team and the setup really is that crooked or you're town and just off your rocker. I would say the setup is almost guaranteed 9:2:1 at this point, otherwise it's completely and utterly unbalanced toward anti-town forces. <br><br>Then don't get me started how lumping me into a scumteam based on other people's reads when we don't even have a scum flip yet is just absurd in itself. <br><br>I really REALLY don't like this post, but I don't even think it's scummy, it's just not good. <br><br>Onto my reads:<br><br>Looks like my CB read was shot to hell, but it sorta makes sense to try to make yourself a little scummy as a BG. And now 3 of my scum reads flip town and I'm doing something wrong. I'm going to reread the thread tomorrow and look at Pie's VCA to try to start reads over from scratch with knowledge of soras, 3k, and CB town. Also want to hear everyone weigh in on the two kills. I still think I can't be wrong on every read though, so process of elimination says Furc is VERY likely scum. Umbrage/Z was the other scum read that was left. Everybody else here was town/neutral, which I'm pretty obviously wrong on at least one of them. I can almost guarantee one of the furc/Z is scum. I'll be looking into those two the most heavily, and from a brief pass over the VCA I don't like Umbrage's votes. Lastly, Ad is looking scummier when more pressure is applied, I'm not so confident in that town read anymore, but I'll delve deeper into that tomorrow.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Pie wrote:</cite>He agrees on Zdenek, calls me suspicious, but then votes oritz.

The problem is you play exactly like I used to as scum.  <span class=\"noboldsig\">You post in a really protown style and then avoid voting for the people who are under suspicion to avoid voting for a mislynch, which makes you look more town.</span>  For example, we had like 4 scum candidates at one point that everyone's attention was on, you posted and called Soras town and then voted Umbrage (who wasn't suspicious at the time.)  It's just a style I'm familiar with and it makes you seem likely scum to me.</div></blockquote><br>Note that he left his vote on cyberbob for the majority of the day. Not only was cyberbob town but he got up to a grand total of 2 whole votes at one point. I would say he was \"avoiding voting for the people who are under suspicion\".</div></blockquote><br><br>This is the 2nd time you've come up with a bullshit reason to vote me.  This is a complete misrep.  My vote was on el simo, umbrage, and soras during Day 1, who all had wagons on them.  Olinea had his vote on Umbrage pretty much the entire day, who hadn't been a lynch candidate since the beginning of the game when I posted that.  The whole point of what I said was that he would make a townie-sounding post, and then stay out of the action for most of the day.  Pretty much the complete opposite of my play.  <br><br>You called me wishy-washy again, prove it.  Show me something wishy-washy I did because you're just making stuff up now.  I'm pretty sure I already proved you wrong on this earlier.  <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">vote: ThAdmiral</span>, from the looks of it, the scummiest people entering the day are me/Admiral/Z.

I have a hard time believing Admiral would push a case that soon on a fellow scumbuddy, especially if they were a scum PR.

I explained my read in that snippet of the post, so I'm not sure what's left to explain. I guess you're searching for some explanation on my part since he flipped scum? I was wrong, that's about all there is to it, though he was admittedly much scummier Day 2 and his VCA was really bad, I still never had a scum read on him. <br><br>2nd one: I think Umbrage voting Furc was a bus. I think that's a pretty straight-forward theory and doesn't really need much explaining either.<br><br>-----------<br><br>I don't care for Z's \"defense.\" That should be enough to convince any other townie left that he needs the noose now.  There's always a way to defend your actions without rolling over, giving up and saying \"well all I can do is WIFOM.\" Even the WIFOM defense wasn't really good. It's not much of a bus when you know the person cannot be lynched. It was a safe vote all day, and one that I'm now convinced was there to make you look more town, because that WIFOM defense you pulled out about how you wouldn't bus a buddy Day 1 was crap and you know it. <br><br>Why did you suddenly change your mind on Day 2 from NLing to voting Thad? Especially directly after I call you and Furc on it.<br><br>Why do you think you cannot defend your actions?<br><br>Who's your top scum read? Second?"}

I posted about a <span style=\"font-style: italic\">Godfather</span> which, after looking at a few Mini Normal setups, seems like a guess that none other than a PR would make.<br><br>Night 1 I investigated <span class=\"noboldsig\">Cyberbob</span> due to his astoundingly unreadable (but mostly anti-town, not so much <span style=\"font-style: italic\">scummy</span>) play.  I was under the impression that no Mafia member would kill Cyberbob due to the fact that a lynch could be made on him so easily.  Well, you all saw his flip \u2013 diddin was nice enough to tell me that Cyberbob had no gun, but fat lot of good that\u2019s doing us now.<br><br>During the day I flip-flopped on the possibility of SK vs. Vigilante.

Of course, the lack of stabbing flavor should have tipped me off in the first place, plus the fact that a lack of a Vigilante would dampen the thing that differs a Gunsmith from a regular Cop.<br><br>Night 2 I investigated <span class=\"noboldsig\">Fugitive</span> as he, too, was unreadable.  He\u2019s an aggressive sort of player as Town, I don\u2019t know much about scum Fugitive but knowing him as a notoriously good player as both scum and Town I figured it\u2019d settle any sort of doubts I had about him.

I think I doubt myself a LOT as Town and when I\u2019m scum (only in short little games, not actual forum games, so I don\u2019t know how accurate I am on this) I push WAY hard on people and try to act like a Town leader.  Ortiz seems to be very self-deprecating when he\u2019s scum, stuff like \u201cGeez I can\u2019t believe I was wrong\u201d or lots of those smiley faces that go :/ (I noticed quite a few of them in SHM5) but when I read SHMWT where he was a Doctor he appeared to take a very pro-town stance, almost as a leader, trying to get everyone involved and active.  In that regard, while meta has always failed me in the past, I think I\u2019ve got a successful meta argument here (inb4 meta is useless, I get it) and I can go re-read him except all of my ISOs on players I find scummy just turn into tunnel vision walls.<br><br>PREVIEW EDIT: Diddin\u2019s PM to me was delayed.  Baby Spice has no gun so at this point I\u2019m almost sold on an Ortiz/Furcolow scumteam.  I'd still like everyone else to claim but this is what I've got and I'd like to get this on the table since I don't think I'll be doing anything but Chemistry and Physics for the remainder of the night."}

He would have gone much better to list WHY they were scummy at first than that +S +T nonesense that could mean anything.

You guys are being a little hard on him. FHPOV there was a PR on lylo that was essentially confirming 2 scum and he was one of them. Anyone could easily think that's a fake PR.
