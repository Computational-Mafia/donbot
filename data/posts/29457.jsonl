If I edit a post, I\u2019ll sign it.</li><li>The only places outside of this thread you are permitted to talk about this game are in mod-provided quicktopics.</li><li>If you\u2019re unsure whether something you post could count against the \u201cplaying to your wincon\u201d rule, think about how you would perceive it if someone else made the same post.</li><li>Personal remarks and insults are not welcome at all. There is no problem with criticising how others play <span style=\"font-style: italic\">in this game</span>, but as soon it goes beyond that line there will be one warning before I start force-replacing.</li><li>If someone is modkilled, their alignment will change to \u201cneutral survivor\u201d and there will be no chance of them winning the game, even if their original faction does so.</li><li>I reserve the right to change rules at any time, including while the game is ongoing, although there will be warning in-thread if this happens.<br><br><br><span style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;\">Activity Rules</span></li><li>If a player does not post in the game thread for over 48 hours, they will be prodded.

If a player has received three or more prods, I reserve the right to search for their replacement if their activity does not pick up.</li><li>Please post V/LA notices in-thread at least 24 hours in advance of them starting.</li><li>Game days will be at most 2 weeks long, unless a replacement is required within the last 48 hours of a game day.</li><li>Game nights will last 48 hours.<br><br><br><span style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;\">Voting Rules</span></li><li>When making votes, please use the vote or bold tags. For a vote (or unvote) to be counted, it must be at the start of a new line.</li><li>Unvoting before voting again is not compulsory.</li><li>If one player receives a majority (at least 51%) of votes, they are that day\u2019s lynch and any further voting/unvoting will be futile.<br><span style=\"padding-left:0.3in\"></span>(Players - including the lynchee - may still comment after majority has been reached and until the mod locks the thread.)</li><li>If a majority of votes is not reached before deadline, there will be no lynch for that day.</li><li>Dead players may make one \u201cbah\u201d post after their death.

Yeah, there have been a lot of votes. But they do seem to have sparked some discussion, which always is nice. I'm liking Kid A calling it out as strange, although he didn't vote. Scum probably would have placed an opportunistic vote there.<br><br>Generic, the bracketed stuff are the two heads this hydra is made out of. Hence, why I accidentally posted on my main account. So, both notscience and The Irish Pope are together here. Usually it's pretty easy to tell us apart xd<br><br>Anyways, I'm waiting to hear King's reasoning for that vote.<br><br>RC/King/DCL/Smudger, feel like there are at least 2 scum within those 4."}

If you look back over what I have said I was quite up front about being stuck with the phone to play this off. Doesn't help with regards to reading people.

The original vote is back. Anyone would think this indecision is filler without anyone being able to push them in why that vote (because even they disagree on the validity of it)<br>Then a series of posts very self focused and seemingly lacking in any sort of content or scum hunting. More filler basically. Then laughably tells me I need to get scum hunting.<br>When he finally begins to show signs if scumhunting he identifies DCL as scummy, but the next post they make has yessiree as one who needs pressure. Again it's a naked vote just for pressure, no case attached.<br>Then we move to a vote on me. Liking the point about me, but can't remember who said it and never says what that point was, but again hints at the vote being for pressure purposes. <br>Basically no scum hunting I can identify even though there's two of them, several naked votes to appear active, a vote on me with some vague reasoning attached that someone somewhere said something...<br><br>I refused to vote just because someone had told me I hadn't, and the reason I hadn't was I hadn't been able to do any assessments.

I would have expected DCL to stick to his guns instead of argue semantics over \"serious\" vs. \"<span class=\"noboldsig\">more</span> serious.\"<br>24 (NTP) - Would have expected NTP to vote for DCL after calling him out. Instead shifts to RC. AJ spots this in 25.<br>26 (Smudger) - Inappropriate RVS vote. Really should have had something to say by then.<br>38-40 (Kid A, RC, Gen) - Ditto. Where's the content? Some points for wagoning though.<br>42 &amp; 43 (absta) - I might be biased, but I like this pair of posts.<br>44 (NTP) - NTP spends an awful lot of time arguing with DCL in defense of Bub. Especially considering that NTP is voting for RC.<br>49 (absta) - Good point against AJ.<br>51 (Bub) - And Bub manages to show exactly why wagons move the day along. Also, he calls NTP town. Definite link, but that doesn't mean much while they're both still alive.<br>54 (NTP) - What is this hydra bullshit. One head thinks RC is town and the other thinks he's scum. Great.<br>58 (Smudger) - No stance taking, but I'll hold my judgment until his next post.<br>65 &amp; 66 (KR &amp; Kid A) - Thanks for the input...<br>79 (Om) - Case on NTP feels padded, but at the same time I can't say that NTP is very townish.<br>98 (levio) - So levio is annoyed that people don't think absta is scum but levio isn't even voting absta, she's voting NTP.<br>I guess levio's newbTown, but the .gif avatar and the run-on writing style just makes her posts annoying to read.<br>105 (RC) - Good post.<br>112 (Smudger) - I still don't know who you think is scum. Looks like absta was thinking the same thing (114).<br>119 (Smudger) - Trying to discredit Bub. Kind of like OMGUS, except without a vote and actually scummy.<br>132 (Kid A) - Bad vote on RC. Wouldn't call it scummy, though.<br>137 (RC) - Also a bad vote on Kid A. Should have stuck with the DCL vote.<br>152 (absta) - I guess this is a decent point about AJ. I'm not \"feeling\" AJ as scum though, but that might change depending on what I see as I catch up.<br>157 (AJ) - Satisfies me somewhat... still think that AJ is placing less pressure on Bub than one would expect from town. Though AJ is hardly the only one to do this.<br>I'm a little weary of someone with \"Best Mafia Performance\" under their username, though. I don't know how recent that is.<br>160 (Kid A) - Blunt. I kinda like it.<br>159-162 - People need to learn to cut down their quotes. It reduces clutter.<br>169 (Smudger) - It's around this time that I realize that half the players in this game will OMGUS at the drop of a hat.<br>176 (N) - This is some of the most scattered voting I've ever seen. With only Gen not voting anyone, 9/13 players have a vote on them, and no one has 3 or more votes. Also these jokes really are extremely shitty.<br>206 (DCL) - Nothing scummy, but I don't see any new scumhunting from a player who has just been sitting on a levio vote for what seems like forever.<br>231 &amp; 232 (NTP, Om) - Agree with Om's analysis for the  most part. Definitely think NTP is exaggerating his case on Gen massively.<br>242 (yessiree) - Wow, thanks for quoting Generic's posts about NTP. I can't think of a feature literally encoded into mafiascum that could have enabled me to find this information myself. This will greatly help my analysis of Generic, which is important because you didn't provide any yourself.<br>248 (yessiree) - You've got to be fucking kidding me. Could you be any more useless? You're not fooling me with your smilies.<br>233-249 and so on - Feeling better about DCL after this exchange with Om. Had a scum read on DCL,  but this bumps him up to null.<br>251 (NTP) - Can I just say how shitty the bolded-replies-within-the-quote system of responding is? I would literally prefer a series of broken up quotes, even though that's cluttery as hell too.<br><blockquote><div><cite>NotThePope wrote:</cite>What makes those games take prominence over this one? Maybe the fact he [Generic] ALREADY KNOWS THE SCUMTEAM</div></blockquote>Do you read what you type?<br>255 (N) - The real shitty jokes are the ones that people are trying to pass off as cases in this game.<br>260 (RC) - Well, at least this case is well-constructed for a change. But I feel like it fails to account for the fact that Kid A is a wildcard/newbTown.<br>278 &amp; 279 (Smudger) - I will grant Smudger that this is a legitimate callout of DCL and RC, respectively.<br>295, 296, 300 (yessiree (x2), Kid A) - This game. This fucking game. Is ridiculous.</div></div></div><br><br>CONCLUSIONS:<br>This game is plagued by inactivity and players of questionable quality. The Kid A wagon sucks and is exactly the sort of wagon I would expect to come out of a game like this (i.e., let's wagon a player for bad reasons because he can't defend himself well).<br><br>List of players who have a vote on someone but aren't actually pressuring that person: Alabaska J, Kid A, Smudger, TMT.<br>In addition, yessiree and NTP both need to just plain get it together.<br><br>Quick list of pending questions (mostly for my benefit): Kid A needs to answer more clearly why an NTP lynch gets more info, DCL should probably followup on #207 somehow, and yessiree should actually analyze the players he is basically posting the ISOs of.<br><br>@Om and/or Generic: Convince me that NTP is scum."}

Continues the case on Levio with decent logic, then switches to cowbell based on not much input of her own, leans on alabaska for an NTP read, goes back to cowbells to point out their OMGUS and show the difference in how each voted for people (the assumption here is that kid gives an explanation and cowbell doesn't).<br>From here there is an abusive outburst to alabaska to give his NTP read, moves his vote to NTP before then switching to NTP with the short reason of it giving most information.<br>He then in single sentence responses pushes NTP, and at one point explains he unvoted alabaska because he went v/la (dies that count as a reason?) before seemingly dodging responses to people who are pushing on him.<br><br>Summarised, there are a few concerns about his play, such as the leaving cases he built in favour of an NTP push which has very little case from him or indeed an explanation, and also the leaving of the alabaska vote I don't fully understand the reasoning given.<br>But beyond that he has been applying pressure and the vote changing up until NTP has always had a strong logic attached to why.<br><br>Is the wagon building solely to force him to stop dodging questions or have I missed something more damning on him?

Also, ald I got that award in 2012 when i briefly came back to the site to play like two games before school prevented me from really rejoining. it was for arrested development mafia, in which i did not play as large a role as the award might indicate due to being v/la for part of endgame."}

And before you state the obvious I know how that sounds, but that is the reason. what is also frustrating is that most of what is happening in this thread is happening when I am asleep, however it would seem we are in similar time zones so now maybe I can get into the flow of this game.

Either DCL was protecting a townier player and ended up dying instead, or they killed DCL over a townier player in case of protection on the townier player. I don't see killing either of you as a particularly good strategy because both of you could easily then have a case made on you the next day (saying this from the perspective that you're both town, though I think that's unlikely considering I'm thinking Bub is scum) because of your chainsaw defending of NTP."}

Call it trying to keep a measure of control if you like, but what have we really learned from day 2 besaides you crack under pressure, cowbells hasn't changed his/her view of kid A but isn't totally tunnelled they cant look elsewhere, and smudger the hammerer has not done an awful lot yet.<br><br>I have 4 im reading as town right now, and thats (in order of how much I believe them to be town) Adlusskel, alabaska, om the nom, kid A.<br><br>In the middle I have cowbells and yessiree. Both of you are very commited, and aggression I know all too well can be born out of frustration so you guys get a null simply because I can empathise with that mindset but cannot call you town while you have these scummy actions.<br><br>I also have to null TMT for bias reasons, I feel very anti him purely because of his tunnelled push on me yesterday. I know I need to be objective, and its why I have shelved him in null, but he has dropped a couple of anti town posts (non committal to the hammer in general and leaned towards kid A without actually commiting a vote) but also been pro town at times, including being willing to put out an updated TS list, although it was very short and lacking in commitment. <br><br>So that leaves:<br>Mutleyddmc - Came in late, was the one who set up the hammer for smudger, but my concern there is that NTP was sinking and had claimed bomb at that point. Posts in single sentences, can really get any major sign of scumhunting or full participation. Feels like he is flying under the radar for me. Leaning scum.<br><br>Bub Bidderskins - Not showing signs of heavy involvement day 2 after being a strong feature of day 1. don't want to see a fast lynch on anyone today while I collect my thoughts, but of the remaining players is the most likely to get my vote if he doesn't put anything down in text that shows me some pro town effort.<br><br>smudger - hammered the scum player. was very keen to hammer it too, so I cant get over the idea he set that up to get major town cred. hasn't really commited much in the analysis  of players, feels like he is flying under the radar.

But then at the same time I am not able to understand why scum would kill off TMT either, because he is very lurky and not contributing much.<br><br>I am thinking maybe scum just wanted to throw us off track by killing TMT. I mean, when you think about it, he didn't really have enough of a presence in this game to really be read either way, and that includes not being read as scum. RC however had a lot of variation in reads between everyone and was probably someone who people's opinions could be swayed on (with more stuff to incriminate, as opposed to little contribution from TMT).<br>RC as a vig kill makes sense because after Bub, he was the most likely scum pushing the Kid A wagon due to his discrediting the NTP wagon without pushing his own wagon (aka basically what I said for Bub yesterday).<br><br><br>NK analysis aside though, I am quite happy to lynch Smudger today.

It was just a bunch of waffles and only a couple decent reasons in there. Most of what you said appeared to be based on nothing and there was no conclusion drawn in the end. It's just useless words designed to look like content. You pointed out no similar reasons for an NK on either of them, and the only similar reason you had for them both potentially being a vig shot was that the vig thought they might be scum (which is completely baseless and not backed up with reasons).<br><br>Why don't we take a look at the progression of your NTP scum read at the end of the day then, shall we?<br><br><div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: Relevant posts (if you think any of the posts between the first and the last that I didn't quote are essential, then feel free to challenge)</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display: none;\"><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5079592#p5079592\" class=\"postlink\">post 377</a>, Smudger wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5077278#p5077278\" class=\"postlink\">post 367</a>, NotThePope wrote:</cite>We found scum, we're just waiting until people realize this and start voting.</div></blockquote><br>unfortunately I do not agree with the \"both\" of you and this persistence is somewhat irritating to the point of making me take another look at the gibberish I find in many of your posts.  maybe people are right about your scummy interaction?</div></blockquote><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5080917#p5080917\" class=\"postlink\">post 380</a>, Smudger wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5080555#p5080555\" class=\"postlink\">post 379</a>, Generic wrote:</cite>With the deadlock being unlikely to change without the remaining three people not voting for either kid A or NTP can those three assess the cases against both and see if either wagon appeals. <br><br>I don't know how the site handles a deadlock at deadline.</div></blockquote><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5079592#p5079592\" class=\"postlink\">post 377</a>, Smudger wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5077278#p5077278\" class=\"postlink\">post 367</a>, NotThePope wrote:</cite>We found scum, we're just waiting until people realize this and start voting.</div></blockquote><br>unfortunately I do not agree with the \"both\" of you and this persistence is somewhat irritating to the point of making me take another look at the gibberish I find in many of your posts.  maybe people are right about your scummy interaction?</div></blockquote><br><br>already am reassessing and prone to move my vote TBH</div></blockquote><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5092894#p5092894\" class=\"postlink\">post 403</a>, Smudger wrote:</cite>My weekend and will not be active until Sunday.

This idea was furthered by the mob mentality of NTP being scum. These are very lackluster reasons to potentially change a read on someone because there is little thought in actually analysing the posts before making the decision to reread.<br>After that you are under the pretense of rereading NTP while waffling on the vote despite claims of you wanting to vote NTP. This is where the idea of indecision comes from, in that you are unsure of whether or not you are really going to follow through with what you are saying.<br>Then comes a few more posts with the intention to vote NTP but not delivering on those intentions.<br>Once you looked at the claim you decided that NTP had to be lynched regardless of the claim's authenticity. This is really beginning to show that you just want the lynch already. This is where the newb-scum impatience comes from (newb-scum would be more excited than newb-town at the idea of being seen as town among everyone).<br>Then after that you were asking about the current town consensus. This looks like a final ditch effort to try and save your buddy by trying to find out if a switch to Kid A is really worth it.<br>Then finally, before the post in which you hammer, you claim that you are wanting to hammer NTP, but then you waffle on it yet again under the pretense of allowing discussion to go a little longer. At the same time you claim that you are not willing to vote Kid A because you weren't very convinced and you were worried that him being at L-1 would be bad (reasons not specified). Here is where you really begin to warm up to the idea of bussing, but it's too late to try any new tactics now so you just solidify your opinion on the matter."}

So my thoughts regarding #501 are wrong, it looks very much like the wagon on Kid A was all town.  which then by default pushes the FoS at Kid A, again.  That does not mean that I should not be considered as scummy based on how you take Oms case on me, although I am not,  I am stating the obvious read given by the events surrounding the lynch of NTP and wagon on Kid A followed by the events of last night and the fact that once again the FoS, by association also points at Kid A.  is it convenient and a very good long term scum rouse or too good to be true?  I for one will go back to the original case made on Kid A that resulted in the wagon that built along side NTPs, has that case been disproved?"}

Either looking to create doubt about me or distance himself from that kill.<br>Fishes on me to give him a case against you by trying to establish whether you had much input into om getting the invite.

Sarcasm through inside knowledge?<br>You were pushing DCL as scum then he does, making you very unlikely as the killer... Distancing?<br>You push TMT as a will add, again distancing from someone who is night killed.
