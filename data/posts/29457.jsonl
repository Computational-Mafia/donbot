You're playing it too safe to be town.</div></blockquote>\n\nobviously most of your case seems to stem from differing opinions on how to use an FoS in a game, so i see it as pretty flimsy and subjective. if i see one person as the most scummy, and see other people being scummy but not as scummy as the person i am voting is continually acting, what should i do? votehop every other post??? again, i use the fos as a marker of sorts to let myself know that i felt so-and-so was scummy at this time. i think bub is scummier than DCL and yessiree, but that is not a reason to not point out when the other two do stuff that sets off my scumdar. i'm curious, do you just votehop constantly the minute someone else does something scummy? you say me and DCL are both good votes; by your logic you should vote both of us since you think we are scummy (obviously impossible, but this demonstrates how absurd i find your argument).<br>\n<br>\ni don't think you are scummy, just misguided. its obvious we have different points of view on a fundamental part of the game, so we may inevitably have to agree to disagree, but you are basically putting together a poor case based on my playstyle. i suggest you strongly consider the points i have made here, since i think i have elucidated why your argument is flawed and hopefully you can move on.", "time": "Tue Jun 25, 2013 4:35 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=29457&start=150", "forum": "53", "thread": "29457"}

So far kid A has opened in RVS with a vote on NTP, then a naked vote to bub, followed by a return to NTP with what looks to be a serious vote based on indecision between the two users making up the hydra. He then criticises NTP for not explaining themselves, explains to me how to read a hydra mindset, then at post 106 changes vote to Levio based on the theory now that NTP will flip town and Levio knows this. Continues the case on Levio with decent logic, then switches to cowbell based on not much input of her own, leans on alabaska for an NTP read, goes back to cowbells to point out their OMGUS and show the difference in how each voted for people (the assumption here is that kid gives an explanation and cowbell doesn't).<br>\nFrom here there is an abusive outburst to alabaska to give his NTP read, moves his vote to NTP before then switching to NTP with the short reason of it giving most information.<br>\nHe then in single sentence responses pushes NTP, and at one point explains he unvoted alabaska because he went v/la (dies that count as a reason?) before seemingly dodging responses to people who are pushing on him.<br>\n<br>\nSummarised, there are a few concerns about his play, such as the leaving cases he built in favour of an NTP push which has very little case from him or indeed an explanation, and also the leaving of the alabaska vote I don't fully understand the reasoning given.<br>\nBut beyond that he has been applying pressure and the vote changing up until NTP has always had a strong logic attached to why.<br>\n<br>\nIs the wagon building solely to force him to stop dodging questions or have I missed something more damning on him?

He then criticises NTP for not explaining themselves, explains to me how to read a hydra mindset, then at post 106 changes vote to Levio based on the theory now that NTP will flip town and Levio knows this. Continues the case on Levio with decent logic, then switches to cowbell based on not much input of her own, leans on alabaska for an NTP read, goes back to cowbells to point out their OMGUS and show the difference in how each voted for people (the assumption here is that kid gives an explanation and cowbell doesn't).<br>\nFrom here there is an abusive outburst to alabaska to give his NTP read, moves his vote to NTP before then switching to NTP with the short reason of it giving most information.<br>\nHe then in single sentence responses pushes NTP, and at one point explains he unvoted alabaska because he went v/la (dies that count as a reason?) before seemingly dodging responses to people who are pushing on him.<br>\n<br>\nSummarised, there are a few concerns about his play, such as the leaving cases he built in favour of an NTP push which has very little case from him or indeed an explanation, and also the leaving of the alabaska vote I don't fully understand the reasoning given.<br>\nBut beyond that he has been applying pressure and the vote changing up until NTP has always had a strong logic attached to why.<br>\n<br>\nIs the wagon building solely to force him to stop dodging questions or have I missed something more damning on him?

I would have expected DCL to stick to his guns instead of argue semantics over \"serious\" vs. \"<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">more</div> serious.\"<br>\n24 (NTP) - Would have expected NTP to vote for DCL after calling him out. Instead shifts to RC. AJ spots this in 25.<br>\n26 (Smudger) - Inappropriate RVS vote. Really should have had something to say by then.<br>\n38-40 (Kid A, RC, Gen) - Ditto. Where's the content? Some points for wagoning though.<br>\n42 &amp; 43 (absta) - I might be biased, but I like this pair of posts.<br>\n44 (NTP) - NTP spends an awful lot of time arguing with DCL in defense of Bub. Especially considering that NTP is voting for RC.<br>\n49 (absta) - Good point against AJ.<br>\n51 (Bub) - And Bub manages to show exactly why wagons move the day along. Also, he calls NTP town. Definite link, but that doesn't mean much while they're both still alive.<br>\n54 (NTP) - What is this hydra bullshit. One head thinks RC is town and the other thinks he's scum. Great.<br>\n58 (Smudger) - No stance taking, but I'll hold my judgment until his next post.<br>\n65 &amp; 66 (KR &amp; Kid A) - Thanks for the input...<br>\n79 (Om) - Case on NTP feels padded, but at the same time I can't say that NTP is very townish.<br>\n98 (levio) - So levio is annoyed that people don't think absta is scum but levio isn't even voting absta, she's voting NTP.<br>\nI guess levio's newbTown, but the .gif avatar and the run-on writing style just makes her posts annoying to read.<br>\n105 (RC) - Good post.<br>\n112 (Smudger) - I still don't know who you think is scum. Looks like absta was thinking the same thing (114).<br>\n119 (Smudger) - Trying to discredit Bub. Kind of like OMGUS, except without a vote and actually scummy.<br>\n132 (Kid A) - Bad vote on RC. Wouldn't call it scummy, though.<br>\n137 (RC) - Also a bad vote on Kid A. Should have stuck with the DCL vote.<br>\n152 (absta) - I guess this is a decent point about AJ. I'm not \"feeling\" AJ as scum though, but that might change depending on what I see as I catch up.<br>\n157 (AJ) - Satisfies me somewhat... still think that AJ is placing less pressure on Bub than one would expect from town. Though AJ is hardly the only one to do this.<br>\nI'm a little weary of someone with \"Best Mafia Performance\" under their username, though. I don't know how recent that is.<br>\n160 (Kid A) - Blunt. I kinda like it.<br>\n159-162 - People need to learn to cut down their quotes. It reduces clutter.<br>\n169 (Smudger) - It's around this time that I realize that half the players in this game will OMGUS at the drop of a hat.<br>\n176 (N) - This is some of the most scattered voting I've ever seen. With only Gen not voting anyone, 9/13 players have a vote on them, and no one has 3 or more votes. Also these jokes really are extremely shitty.<br>\n206 (DCL) - Nothing scummy, but I don't see any new scumhunting from a player who has just been sitting on a levio vote for what seems like forever.<br>\n231 &amp; 232 (NTP, Om) - Agree with Om's analysis for the  most part. Definitely think NTP is exaggerating his case on Gen massively.<br>\n242 (yessiree) - Wow, thanks for quoting Generic's posts about NTP. I can't think of a feature literally encoded into mafiascum that could have enabled me to find this information myself. This will greatly help my analysis of Generic, which is important because you didn't provide any yourself.<br>\n248 (yessiree) - You've got to be fucking kidding me. Could you be any more useless? You're not fooling me with your smilies.<br>\n233-249 and so on - Feeling better about DCL after this exchange with Om. Had a scum read on DCL,  but this bumps him up to null.<br>\n251 (NTP) - Can I just say how shitty the bolded-replies-within-the-quote system of responding is? I would literally prefer a series of broken up quotes, even though that's cluttery as hell too.\n<blockquote><div><cite>NotThePope wrote:</cite>What makes those games take prominence over this one? Maybe the fact he [Generic] ALREADY KNOWS THE SCUMTEAM</div></blockquote>Do you read what you type?<br>\n255 (N) - The real shitty jokes are the ones that people are trying to pass off as cases in this game.<br>\n260 (RC) - Well, at least this case is well-constructed for a change. But I feel like it fails to account for the fact that Kid A is a wildcard/newbTown.<br>\n278 &amp; 279 (Smudger) - I will grant Smudger that this is a legitimate callout of DCL and RC, respectively.<br>\n295, 296, 300 (yessiree (x2), Kid A) - This game. This fucking game. Is ridiculous.</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\nCONCLUSIONS:<br>\nThis game is plagued by inactivity and players of questionable quality.

Bub is the person who seems to fit the bill here. yesiree would be my second guess. However, if scum had been bussing instead then it was most likely Smudger, who could have been unsure of whether or not to bus which is why he waited so long to hammer (but I'm not as sure of this theory).

Call it trying to keep a measure of control if you like, but what have we really learned from day 2 besaides you crack under pressure, cowbells hasn't changed his/her view of kid A but isn't totally tunnelled they cant look elsewhere, and smudger the hammerer has not done an awful lot yet.<br>\n<br>\nI have 4 im reading as town right now, and thats (in order of how much I believe them to be town) Adlusskel, alabaska, om the nom, kid A.<br>\n<br>\nIn the middle I have cowbells and yessiree.

I know I need to be objective, and its why I have shelved him in null, but he has dropped a couple of anti town posts (non committal to the hammer in general and leaned towards kid A without actually commiting a vote) but also been pro town at times, including being willing to put out an updated TS list, although it was very short and lacking in commitment. <br>\n<br>\nSo that leaves:<br>\nMutleyddmc - Came in late, was the one who set up the hammer for smudger, but my concern there is that NTP was sinking and had claimed bomb at that point.

Leaning scum.<br>\n<br>\nBub Bidderskins - Not showing signs of heavy involvement day 2 after being a strong feature of day 1. don't want to see a fast lynch on anyone today while I collect my thoughts, but of the remaining players is the most likely to get my vote if he doesn't put anything down in text that shows me some pro town effort.<br>\n<br>\nsmudger - hammered the scum player. was very keen to hammer it too, so I cant get over the idea he set that up to get major town cred. hasn't really commited much in the analysis  of players, feels like he is flying under the radar.

This idea was furthered by the mob mentality of NTP being scum. These are very lackluster reasons to potentially change a read on someone because there is little thought in actually analysing the posts before making the decision to reread.<br>\nAfter that you are under the pretense of rereading NTP while waffling on the vote despite claims of you wanting to vote NTP. This is where the idea of indecision comes from, in that you are unsure of whether or not you are really going to follow through with what you are saying.<br>\nThen comes a few more posts with the intention to vote NTP but not delivering on those intentions.<br>\nOnce you looked at the claim you decided that NTP had to be lynched regardless of the claim's authenticity. This is really beginning to show that you just want the lynch already. This is where the newb-scum impatience comes from (newb-scum would be more excited than newb-town at the idea of being seen as town among everyone).<br>\nThen after that you were asking about the current town consensus. This looks like a final ditch effort to try and save your buddy by trying to find out if a switch to Kid A is really worth it.<br>\nThen finally, before the post in which you hammer, you claim that you are wanting to hammer NTP, but then you waffle on it yet again under the pretense of allowing discussion to go a little longer. At the same time you claim that you are not willing to vote Kid A because you weren't very convinced and you were worried that him being at L-1 would be bad (reasons not specified). Here is where you really begin to warm up to the idea of bussing, but it's too late to try any new tactics now so you just solidify your opinion on the matter.", "time": "Tue Jul 16, 2013 4:06 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=29457&start=725", "forum": "53", "thread": "29457"}

However you will go and meta to see if the scumhunting is normally like this.<br>\n<br>\nHowever 3 of your posts later you come back and vote for not scum hunting. Had you done your meta you would have seen that is the hyrda heads from NTP, they dont do a lot of quality scumhunting on day 1 especially. So why did you come back and vote? meta would have agreed that it was a disorganized hydra.
