I'd say that Town is more challenging, based solely on the fact that even if you get lynched as Mafia, there's potential for your team to benefit from your death, whereas a townie lynch tends to get the wrong people suspected.<br>\n<br>\nMafia requires a more nuanced social game, while Town requires a lot more brainpower and reasoning skills.

Easy.</div></blockquote><br>\nSo now that I have questioned you about it, why are you keeping your vote up without justification? You are voting to put someone to death without providing reasoning for why you think they are scum. If that up there was your only reason for the vote, then why continue to have an unproductive vote up?</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">unvote: Vote Avasthearties</div><br>\n<br>\nFor that exact reason. There was more to react to. Yonzy was at two votes, safely five away from a lynch. Do you believe that a vote has to just mean a call to lynch? What about the vote is suspicious, besides the lack of explanation. <br>\n<br>\n@Wicked; I chose yonzy for the no explanation vote for a comment I saw about not reading shorter posts. Settled with me the wrong way but it's hardly worth lynching over. So the vote went unexplained, to get information on two fronts. The first being pressure on yonzy and the second to catch an overreaction. Judging an overreaction to me is intuition. To explain in this instance, Yonzy was at two votes, mine being the second. Hardly close to a lynch. When Avas voted me for being 'suspicious' it seemed off. <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Yonzy wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Wickedestjr wrote:</cite><br>\n<br>\nYonzy, why no random vote? <br>\n<br>\nI have more to say in a few minutes.</div></blockquote><br>\nI didnt know RVS stage was still on lol<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: Kid Know Nothing</div><br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Wickedestjr wrote:</cite>I'm going to <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Unvote.

It smells slightly like an off-handed comment to make us feel like simo is town using slight AtE.  It's not a lynch-worthy case at this point, but it's a better than random vote.<br>\n<br>\nAlso, you'd seriously trust an old lady?

I don't see how saying he's been town in all of his other games is meant to imply he's town this game. Secondly, there's no reason for him to add the phrase \"It's not a lynch-worthy case at this point, but better than an RV.\" unless he's scum giving himself room to backpedal. Finally, he adds a jokey reason to his vote despite already having a serious reason. The vote feels off.</div></blockquote><br>\nImo it seemed liek a legit reason to vote El simo.. I would've done the same thing, and even if it wasn't, he had reason for his suspicion.. so there's really no need to vote him. <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>HezLucky wrote:</cite><br>\nYes I can. Most people in this game have had a little bit of fun and randomness to your answers, but YankCane seems to think he'll get town cred by answering them completely seriously.

Furthermore, his sentence \"Regarding the Miller claim\" adds nothing substantial to this game, while making it seem like he is doing some early analysis.</div></blockquote><br>\nI'd think that if most people answered with fun and randomness, then he wouldnt really see an attempt to joke as risky.<br>\n<br>\nbtww im ignoring the small posts soo if my points are repetitive thats why.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nJust this post in general, which has already been commented on, is deserving of pressure in some form.

Hmm. I wouldn't call it an \"OMGUS tirade\" without explaining why you feel it's such. You're not going to get people believing you by saying one thing but not expanding more. That goes back to that \"trying to appear town\" thing which, by the way, you're voting <div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">me</div> for. avasthehearties just posted a case and isn't lurking anymore, so there's another fallacy.

Furthermore, his sentence \"Regarding the Miller claim\" adds nothing substantial to this game, while making it seem like he is doing some early analysis.</div></blockquote><br>\nCan this point be used against avasthearties who also answered my questions seriously?</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nNo, avasthehearties answered my \"WHO WANTS PIE?\" question, which satisfies the quota of randomness I'm looking for. He's also not trying at all to be useful.<br>\n<br>\nYankCane is just cautious, <div style=\"display:inline-flex;text-decoration:line-through\">period.</div></div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nOk, we've got another tidbit.

I'm also a lynch target for proof.

That, itself, isn't suspicious, but a miller's allignment can't be determined via cop investigation. So we determine their allignment based solely on their play during the day.

But at that junction, nobody expects you to be doing anything, so the only motivation is trying to look town.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n----------------------TWO----------------------<br>\n<br>\nLook at Yank's behaviour over the course of the game. He cannot actually respond to any of my points, and is freaking out about that, so he decides that the best defense is a good offense. He is trying to shift the focus from himself to me, simply<br>\nbecause I'm attacking him, in hopes that I will go away.<br>\n<br>\nFurthermore, Yank makes it look like he is scumhunting -- but where has he actually committed to anyone? Besdies me, BECAUSE I'M VOTING FOR HIM. Yank's behaviour is highly self-preservationist. Make yourself look good. Pretend you are scumhunting.<br>\nBut don't actually commit to anyone being scum unless they attack you. This is not scumhunting. Scumhunting means you have opinions on people OTHER than those who are voting for you.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n---------------THREE-------------------<br>\n<br>\nOkay, let's get to the posts he makes in response to me:<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Yank wrote:</cite>Hez, You were after Anon until he finally agreed with you on something. I believe you're letting him direct your vote. Is it possible bussing during RVS then teaming later? Sure, but I can't say that for certain yet. #118 is trying to look town but really says nothing \"I did an Iso, see! So what they have 3 posts?\" (There's no need to brag about doing an ISO, it just screams of looking for towncred), when you were/are voting me for such. #90 Contradicts #50 about unfair scumtells. You wrap up that quote on #50 with \"But it's all cool, no worries\" (did the same in #67). This gives me a vibe of not trying to offend anyone. Do you see the contradictions with your case on me and your own play? (Keep in mind I think your whole argument is based one 1-2 posts while I can name multiple where you're doing the same thing as me)<br>\n<br>\nUnvote, Vote:Hezlucky</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nHe's directing my vote? I had two suspects, I liked one's response and now I'm testing the other (that's you, by the way). I don't like your response at all. <br>\n<br>\n#118 - Yes, I did an ISO. Yes, I found very little. Would you like me not to post? I was actually contemplating voting the mastin/lateralus hydra before the set of ISOs I did, and I stumbled upon a relevant point (one I was hoping I could have gotten a response to -- but I don't seem to have. lateralus: why do you replace in and out of so many games?)<br>\n<br>\nBut your number system is annoying, because now I actually have to look at my own ISO:<br>\n<br>\nOkay, looked at it. Your points are pathetic. You've basically decided ahead of time that I'm scum, and tried to fit the evidence to match your case. I don't know how familiar you are with the game of Mafia, but you can make a reasonable case on ANYONE that isn't obvtown in any game at any time. Games aren't won by cases. They are won by looking for intentions. I believe when you were writing the above post, you were specifically looking for evidence and things you could accuse me of doing rather than objectively evaluating my posts. This makes you either vengeful town, or scum that needs to hang. Seeing as I've already got a scumread on you, I know which one I'll be going with.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nBUT I do understand the gist of your argument: You claim that I am voting you for a few small points, that also apply to me. If you think my posts are filler, consider the following similarities between me and you:<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nHOW YANKCANE AND I ARE SIMILAR (aka. why yankcane thinks I'm voting for him because of things I have also done)<br>\n<br>\n- we both ask questions to others to help us scumhunt and determine alignment<br>\n- YankCane thinks we both \"are trying to appear pro-town and not offend anyone\"<br>\n<br>\nHOW YANKCANE AND I ARE DIFFERENT (aka. the truth about the second point)<br>\n<br>\n- First of all, I could care less whether or not I offend anyone. I've called several people out this game already, a point which you seem to have conveniently forgotten. The second part of your argument is now moot.<br>\n<br>\n- More importantly, the argument that \"he's so town he's scum\" is a ridiculous one. You can make that argument about anyone who hasn't committed any sort of scumtell. Speaking of fallacious arguments, that's one right there. The reason I am voting for you is, I'll repeat, YOU WERE TRYING TO LOOK PROTOWN DURING A PORTION OF THE GAME WHERE NOBODY EXPECTS YOU TO BE USEFUL. You were posting fluff (ie. things that look like they are game-related, but really say nothing) during a moment where a lot of randomness was happening. <br>\n<br>\n- Oh, and your response to me. You have no case whatsoever, yet you insist that you do and cry that \"OMG HEZ IS NOT RESPONDING TO MY POSTS HE MUST BE SCUM\". Basically, I wouldn't be holding any of this against you except for the fact that you are voting for me. If you said \"Hey Hez, you've done the exact same things, let me list them ALL out for you\" and you weren't voting for me, I would think you were trying to prove a point. Yet since you are voting for me, you are instead trying to manipulate the evidence in order to form a case on me. You aren't trying to make a point anymore, you are trying to form a counterwagon. Why should I let your buddies hide while you do the talking? It's very obvious from the way your posts are constructed that you decided AHEAD of time that you wanted to attack someone that was attacking you, and since a) I provided less evidence in my votepost and (b) I had no one suspecting me, meaning that your vote would look more like actual scumhunting, you chose me.<br>\n<br>\n- Finally, if you are town (OH MY GOD WHAT? ... yeah, I'm wrong sometimes. Bite me.), Read Open 302. Not the whole thing. Focus on Me and MagnaofIllusion. Note that our argument over-took the entire game in the later days, and eventually lead to a lynch on a townie and a near guaranteed scum victory. If you continue to attack me, please argue better, because I am quite vengeful and WILL get you lynched if I don't believe you are legitimate. At the moment, I don't think your arguments are (your providing evidence to fit your hypothesis, and not the other way around - I didn't think you were scum until I READ that post of yours. You've essentially made up a case on me and looked for evidence to fit your facts. This is a mafia tactic, not a town one. Vote stands.)<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nI want to hear from OTHERS on this. I don't really care for having a back and forth dialogue with scum.

It's just the way he went about it. A vote with \"suspicious thing is suspicious\" does very little to really further hunting. What was suspicious about it? Was the vote opportunistic? No. If I was looking for an easy wagon, CA would have been a better choice. He was already getting suspicion thrown at him. Why go after someone who had an FoS and people were largely ignoring? No benefit. Was the vote an OMGUS?

I have seen his type enough to know that regardless of everything he is going to come off as Derpy Hooves and get lynched or vig shot in most games.

Despite him simply needed to be replaced, your Yonzy case holds a whole lot more water than the Avas one that you are pushing because its based on what you think the proper reaction to your just vote post was.  What if I think that him voting you was the correct thing to have done in that situation, and another pony thinks ignoring it was, and then you think simply commenting on it was and so on.  My point is, everypony sees things like that differently, and that is your entire case, theory of YOURS.  Yes what are tells are generally just applied theory, but its common concensus theory, this is not.<br>\n<br>\nWhat this also does has allowed you to essentially ignore the rest of the game.  I have no clue where you stand on the whole back and forth between HezLucky and YankCane.  I have no clue what you think of HH and the fakeclaim (which was AMAZINGLY stupid, I would expect play like that from Mastin but not Lat).

Just because I don't comment on something does not mean I am ignoring it. This question also wasn't meant for you. <br>\n<br>\nI've seen a similar fake-claim before. In fake, it was the first game I played with CA. Hoopla claimed PGO to a similar effect. It didn't phase me. Miller is a safer claim and there are some differences, but the principle remains roughly the same.<br>\n<br>\nCA is town. You are most likely town. Yonzy needs to be replaced or post.

Your vote and CA's?] Why should I let your buddies hide while you do the talking? <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">It's very obvious from the way your posts are constructed that you decided AHEAD of time that you wanted to attack someone that was attacking you, and since a) I provided less evidence in my votepost and (b) I had no one suspecting me, meaning that your vote would look more like actual scumhunting, you chose me.</div><sup>3</sup> [A)there was enough evidence to begin questioning you and B) The points are valid whether there's 1 or 9 people questioning you.]<br>\n<br>\n- Finally, if you are town (OH MY GOD WHAT? ... yeah, I'm wrong sometimes. Bite me.), Read Open 302. Not the whole thing. Focus on Me and MagnaofIllusion. Note that our argument over-took the entire game in the later days, and eventually lead to a lynch on a townie and a near guaranteed scum victory. If you continue to attack me, please argue better, because I am quite vengeful and WILL get you lynched if I don't believe you are legitimate. At the moment, I don't think your arguments are (your providing evidence to fit your hypothesis, and not the other way around - I didn't think you were scum until I READ that post of yours. You've essentially made up a case on me and looked for evidence to fit your facts. This is a mafia tactic, not a town one. Vote stands.)<br>\n<br>\n[Whole paragraph=Empty Threat and an ATE]<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nI want to hear from OTHERS on this. I don't really care for having a back and forth dialogue with scum.

If you want to build up a legitimate case to throw at me, I'll be all for defending it.

Point to me where HH Is voting Hez, again? Point to me where I voted Wicked again?  <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\"> <br>\n<br>\nChainsaw defense time folks!<br>\n<br>\n2) First, that was a snarky reaction to the fallacy behind HH directing my vote. It's just as easy for me to say the same thing about you and Hez. Of course in this case, it is absolutely true, (he's even said such), Hez DID agree with his suspect and then voted me. There's no need to defend him for something <div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">he didn't even do.</div> Oh, unless you're talking about agreeing on votes, or reads, which, hmm, what did I do as to HH's read on Wicked? Agreed that my gut was also off regarding Wicked. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Which is it, Anon?</div> Am I guilty for agreeing with someone else (Like Hez did with you but you find that pro-town), or am I guilty for letting HH direct my vote (which Hez did with you but you find that pro-town). If you're being special because he's agreeing with you, then that's asinine because HH and I aren't even talking about you or Hez, we're talking about Hez (Unless the team is Anon-Wicked-Hez?  <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\"> )<br>\n<br>\nBasically, that first line regarding my post is not a good point in any way because, gasp, it's a contradiction. (Scumtell for the folks at home who aren't following)<br>\n<br>\n3) Jeez, this seems familiar, someone taking my words and stretching them then accusing me of stretching my own words. Who does that remind us of? (Hint: HezLucky). Either you're secretly the same person or you're buddies. Let's strikethrough all the false assumptions again! Like Hez, you are also calling this a horrid case(without addressing it or even seemingly reading it.) and that no one should consider it. Always a good thing to convince people that you're right and I'm wrong.<br>\n<br>\n4)I'm scum trying to debunk you about HH? What in the world does that have to do with my case again Hez? Again, you're not reading my Case. It has nothing to do with HH at all, it has to do with Hez's contradictory vote, bandwagon, bussing of you (that's now relevant with this post), etc.<br>\n<br>\n5)Why does his response give you major town points? Did you not read the contradictions I again pointed out the post after his? Read it again if so. Be more open than tunnelheaded. Hez isn't confirmed town so stop treating him like such. I'm not confirmed scum so stop treating ME as such. Which is what you're doing. Hez's whole case seems to me like opportunistic scum trying to pounce on a newer player's mistake, but at least, if you're town, be more open minded and don't team up with Hez for the heck of it. Really, tell me WHY Hez is town, not just that he \"is.\"", "time": "Sat Jul 23, 2011 10:49 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=18365&start=175", "forum": "53", "thread": "18365"}

You're new, but I'm not. I have a meta. And your refusal to read any of the game I've listed is noted. Why does that make you scum? Because reading dozens and dozens of pages in Open 302 gives yuo no actual payoff, while inventing a case on me does. And it's just that. You are exactly like Magna. I told Magna that he could invent a case on ANYONE in an attempt to get them lynched, but it does not make them scum. Magna did not understand that. I got him lynched as a result. I was frustrated. I am frustrated like that right now too. The thing is: you're dropping all the \"scumtells\" he dropped (aka. not scumtells) in that you're acting like him, but you've dropped several additional ones as well. Magna didn't tunnel -- you are over the top. Magna wasn't trying to form a case against me at all costs like his life depended on it -- you are. And you are trying to bait me, unlike Magna. It seems like you are trying to intentionally make me angry, and then point and say \"OH LOOK HIS REACTION\". No, this will not do. Read the game. I want to know what you find. I know you have way more time on your hands than anyone else, and it's a fascinating read or your money back. Then tell me what you find.

Point to me where HH Is voting Hez, again? Point to me where I voted Wicked again?   <br>\n<br>\nChainsaw defense time folks!<br>\n<br>\n2) First, that was a snarky reaction to the fallacy behind HH directing my vote. It's just as easy for me to say the same thing about you and Hez. Of course in this case, it is absolutely true, (he's even said such), Hez DID agree with his suspect and then voted me. There's no need to defend him for something he didn't even do. Oh, unless you're talking about agreeing on votes, or reads, which, hmm, what did I do as to HH's read on Wicked? Agreed that my gut was also off regarding Wicked. Which is it, Anon? Am I guilty for agreeing with someone else (Like Hez did with you but you find that pro-town), or am I guilty for letting HH direct my vote (which Hez did with you but you find that pro-town). If you're being special because he's agreeing with you, then that's asinine because HH and I aren't even talking about you or Hez, we're talking about Hez (Unless the team is Anon-Wicked-Hez?   )<br>\n<br>\nBasically, that first line regarding my post is not a good point in any way because, gasp, it's a contradiction. (Scumtell for the folks at home who aren't following)<br>\n<br>\n3) Jeez, this seems familiar, someone taking my words and stretching them then accusing me of stretching my own words. Who does that remind us of? (Hint: HezLucky). Either you're secretly the same person or you're buddies. Let's strikethrough all the false assumptions again! Like Hez, you are also calling this a horrid case(without addressing it or even seemingly reading it.) and that no one should consider it. Always a good thing to convince people that you're right and I'm wrong.<br>\n<br>\n4)I'm scum trying to debunk you about HH? What in the world does that have to do with my case again Hez? Again, you're not reading my Case. It has nothing to do with HH at all, it has to do with Hez's contradictory vote, bandwagon, bussing of you (that's now relevant with this post), etc.<br>\n<br>\n5)Why does his response give you major town points? Did you not read the contradictions I again pointed out the post after his? Read it again if so. Be more open than tunnelheaded. Hez isn't confirmed town so stop treating him like such. I'm not confirmed scum so stop treating ME as such. Which is what you're doing. Hez's whole case seems to me like opportunistic scum trying to pounce on a newer player's mistake, but at least, if you're town, be more open minded and don't team up with Hez for the heck of it. Really, tell me WHY Hez is town, not just that he \"is.\"</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nThis is crap.<br>\n<br>\nI'll outline why, but only by request of a player other than Yank.

Anon, Hez, and Rainbowdash.(TBF, I'm not that sure on Rainbowdash) Hmm, Interesting, as they're the ones I suspect. Stop stalling, either defend yourselves or lynch yourselves, one of the two.

Realize I have stated multiple times my case against Hez and Anon, with legitimate proof and arguments, and yet both of them continue to skirt my attacks. Does anyone want to copy and paste what I said so they can defend it? Vifam, are you ever going to post your case againse Hez? Can we do anything here? They obviously can't defend themselves against me because they know I'm right.

Im done responding to you.<br>\n<br>\nYou are probably town, but at this point you are nearly as big of a liability to the town as scum are, since you dont get it.  The game does not revolve around you, but it resolves around us, as a collective, working together to figure out who stands up for friendship and who stands up for evil.  When you bypass the us aspect of the game, you take away one of the biggest things that we can have going for us in discussion, which creates information.  Asking for people to comment on a case is all well and good, and it should be done by everyone on a regular basis to keep the database full, however you are not perfect, even I am not perfect (shocking I know), so you need to be willing to listen to reason.  You also need to be willing to change when its necessary to change, and at this juncture, you need to give up your current wagon and move on.  Hez is not going to be lynched today, ponies have been posting and no one agrees with it.  No matter how many times you post what is essentially (it is) the same thing, you will probably not change anyponies minds.  You will more likely accomplish the opposite in ponies deciding to no longer take you seriously and instead ignore further opinions of yours, you can see it happening already.  The worst part is as ive already said, you are probably town, and doing just about the worst job of using that status as possible.  So please, for all of our sakes move on so this GAME can move forward.

I want him to respond so we can be done, I don't want him immaturely calling me a troll or something to that extent.<br>\n<br>\nHez is scum because:<br>\n-His case on me is wishy washy and also wrong. He originally voted for me for my RQS post, but unvoted me, only to re-vote me when CA made a case against me.<br>\n-I pointed out his contradictions, to which he responded that my case was \"utter crap\" \"garbage\" \"waste of time\". aka, an IIoA defense.<br>\n-I also point out the contradictions in CA's post, to which Hez immediately comes in and also calls that case the same words as before.<br>\n-Annoyed, I decide to change my approach. I post wiki links to all his fallacies. I start analyzing deeper into his posts, and come up with some valid points. Hez does not do anything but continue to call my case \"crap\" and call me \"sure scum\" because I'm voting him.(And he called me out on OMGUS, too.)<br>\n-I took this as him slipping. He then posts a link to Open 302 which he wishes to use to drive me off without answering the questions of me, then he unvotes me in an AtE to try and get me off. (Meanwhile he accused me of attacking him so he'd get off me)<br>\n-In Open 302, I was surprised to find that HezLucky's playstyle there(he was town) is different from this game. Alot more analysis, he actually defended himself, etc. I asked him where that attitude was this game. He responds by calling me a troll.<br>\n-All the while that he's had his vote off of me, he hasn't weighed in anywhere else on the game, including a post where I asked him his opinion on the KKN wagon. I fear he may end up trying to cruise trough the rest of the game because our argument was majority-deemed townVtown.<br>\n<br>\nThose are the points I want Hez to respond too.

The IIoA shrug off of my post in #13 is what bothers me the most.<br>\n<br>\nI don't want to start another argument, don't worry. I just want my concerns answered.

Mostly that it was based off a \"bad reaction\" to an unexplained vote, which really is about as subjective as you can get.  I actually don't have avas as a strong town read here, as he hangs more around the neutral area, but how he is getting pushed there is something that is very wrong and needs to be shut down since it threatens to degrade into theory and semantics arguements instead of scumhunting.  Sometimes its best to just make the play that will keep everyone in line regardless of how you view somepony.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>@EVERYONE: Does anyone have any meta on bobsnox? Does he play like this as town?</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nQuick meta-alignment skim shows he was scum in Simpsons Large.  Haven't been able to read that game though.  Work the early shift this week and am out of town this weekend (lets say im going back to Cloudsdale for housekeeping chores), although I expect access.  If somepony else wants to tl;dr it for me I would appreciate it.  Tarin is the only one I have meta'd and the recent posts lean heavy to her town game, although the first few aren't even all that close to anyalignment games.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3275771#p3275771\" class=\"postlink\">Love Rainbow's Post 209 just for the colorful picture.</a> Although I disagree on his lynch pool. </div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nI have plenty of pictures.  And all the links to MLP: FiM episodes.  If you haven't watched those you really should, its one of the biggest surprise kids TV shows since Total Drama Island.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>@Rainbow: Why are you not willing to consider anyone else's vote?</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nNo one else is making much of an attempt in this game if we remove what went down between Yank and Hez.  We have had a continual promise of a case from HH, the avas case from KKN which almost annoys me more then is a tell as I think more since he misses all the possible points I see for the nullest of nulls, there is also the case of... well... hrmm... I actually don't think anyother pony has made a case this game.  I may be all for friendship, but they have to make some sort of effort for me not to just consider them off in their own world and needing direction, which I am all to willing to give.<br>\n<br>\nBesides, look at the wagons we got.  Yank, HH, KKN and HEZ?  I mean, lets throw dice while we are at it.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Shit why is the pressure on Yank going away. What the hell, people. KKN is town and TO is possibly town too. Neither of them are anyone I'd feel comfortable lynching at this point. </div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nI actually agree with everything but Yank, who really hasn't responded like anypony I have ever seen who is scum being throttled by a strong personality, at least in his followup posts to the inital attack.  Maybe I have a wrong read here due to that type of play being one area I personally avoid getting into so my mindset misses some tells there, but if he is scum then he made some very risky plays.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>@Rainbow: Why is Yank town?</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nI think the first thing that got me sided with Yank was his response to the questions from Hez, which are near mirror images of what I think the \"correct\" ones are.<br>\n<br>\nWhen he got attacked though, he firmly stood his ground and didn't give up what his beliefs were, despite the multiple lifelines that I was trying to throw him in order to stop the continual back and forth that was going on.  Attacking Hez was probably about the hardest thing that Yank could have done in that situation, especially when I was opening the doors for a KKN wagon and he never even slightly bit on it.  Almost every single one of his posts are worded in ways that do nothing to try and convince people to move off of him, and all set him up to have to spend a long period of time digging out of holes as he continued to attack Hez and CA, who were regarded for the most part as town, instead of going for anypony that may possibly be construed as an easy target.  I mean, you saw me take almost ten pages of constant poking to get him to give up what was a complete dead end for him.  I just dont see scum so unwilling to cooperate with me, and the only way I really can see Yank scum at this point is if its with someponies like Wicked/Vifam/KKN.  Even then, its a bit of a stretch.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Best place for the vote for now. He needs a lot more pressure than he's been getting.

Attacking Hez was probably about the hardest thing that Yank could have done in that situation, especially when I was opening the doors for a KKN wagon and he never even slightly bit on it. Almost every single one of his posts are worded in ways that do nothing to try and convince people to move off of him, and all set him up to have to spend a long period of time digging out of holes as he continued to attack Hez and CA, who were regarded for the most part as town, instead of going for anypony that may possibly be construed as an easy target. I mean, you saw me take almost ten pages of constant poking to get him to give up what was a complete dead end for him.

Especially after how he deflects it towards ConfidAnon in his next post. Saying \"it's not a lynch-worthy case\" shows that he's not out thirsting for blood over something that small. I don't see it as any sort of scumtell.</div></blockquote><br>\nFirstly, I don't see how I shied away from HH's suspicion of me. He never gave any reasons and refused to explain his vote even when I asked. What the heck was I supposed to do instead and how exactly did I even shy away?   <br>\n<br>\nSecondly, I still think it was unneccessary to mention that the case wasn't lynch-worthy. That was something that was fairly obvious anyway and it just gives him room to backpedal if he gets suspicion for his vote. Also, I would like to point out that LobsterCatapult, the player that Friend replaced and supposedly knows was town, also used this point against ConfidAnon.

Weak wagon-hop on someone who's obviously pretty confident on him being scum.</div></blockquote><br>\nFirstly, what does it matter if HH suspects me? Is it always suspicious to vote somebody that suspects you? Secondly, HH wasn't explaining any of his reads and I wanted that to change. I figured the only way to force them to explain was by pressuring them. I noticed HH had a bandwagon and realized that bandwagon might not be there forever. I took advantage of the attention on him and voted him then. <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Friend wrote:</cite>God, again.

I was V/LA!!! No wonder I was slipping into the background. Kind of hard not to when you have out-of-game reasons for not being capable of posting.

Those contradictory points are the only reasons avasthearties provides to justify his Vifam read and this whole paragraph seems like useless fluff. And IIRC there was never any followup to these comments, anyway. <br>\n<br>\nFor these reasons, I'm curious why avasthearties even felt the need to give his read on Vifam rather than wait until after seeing more from him. I don't think it was because anybody asked him about his read (or at least I didn't see anybody ask him about his Vifam read). It wasn't because he was giving his thoughts on all of the players. It wasn't because he was giving his thoughts on the replacements, because he didn't say anything about Rainbowdash. He didn't have anything helpful to say about Vifam, wanted to hear more from him, and didn't give a strong read on him either way, so why did he even post his read on Vifam? I see a possible connection. It looks like avasthearties scum may have felt obligated to say something about his scumbuddy. Either that, or avasthearties scum is just trying to appear helpful and didn't do a very good job of it. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:red\">II.</div></div> This was something avasthearties said after I voted him, but I find it suspicious and thought I'd include it in my case anyway.

He says that my vote looks like an attempt to save myself, but this logic is bad for two reasons:<br>\n<br>\n<ul><li>This same point could easily be used against me if I had voted for bobsnox or tarsonisocelot (somebody I had already expressed suspicion of) instead.<br>\n</li><li>Trying to prevent my lynch this late in the day isn't a scumtell.

This post includes IIoA because he implies suspicion of me but never does say that he actually suspects me. I also think that the implied suspicion feels pretty opportunistic. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:red\">III.</div></div> For most of the day avasthearties tunneled on Kid Know Nothing for what I felt were weak reasons. The vote boils down to Kid Know Nothing casting a reasonless vote IIRC. This is especially strange considering Kid Know Nothing wasn't the only person to vote without giving a reason. bobsnox, HH, and I are all also guilty of voting without reason in this game. YankCane brought up bobsnox's reasonless vote and avasthearties responded by saying:<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3277840#p3277840\" class=\"postlink\">avasthearties</a> wrote:</cite>And as for 13, <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">he explained his vote in between then and my post,</div> unlike KKN who only provided a BS \"I wanted to see who would overreact\" answer after the fact.</div></blockquote><br>\n...which strikes me as an unusual defense because bobsnox only explained the vote in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3276243#p3276243\" class=\"postlink\">post 257</a> because Vifam questioned it. So bobsnox didn't explain his vote until Vifam asked him about it, but avasthearties let him get away with it simply because he ('he' being avasthearties) didn't have to bother asking him about it. <br>\n<br>\navasthearties never does try to explain why they didn't question Horrifying Hero and I. This is even worse. He voted Kid Know Nothing for <div style=\"display:inline;color:blue\">posting a vote without giving reasons</div>, <div style=\"display:inline;color:green\">explaining</div> only after being asked about it, and <div style=\"display:inline;color:purple\">giving bad reasons</div> for withholding his case. However, I would think that avasthearties would be much more interested in voting Horrifying Hero for <div style=\"display:inline;color:blue\">posting a vote and insisting they are voting scum, but without giving reasons</div>, <div style=\"display:inline;color:green\">not explaining</div> even after being asked to, and <div style=\"display:inline;color:purple\">giving no reasons</div> for withholding their case. Instead, avasthearties, when commenting on Horrifying Hero, says:<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3277636#p3277636\" class=\"postlink\">avasthearties</a> wrote:</cite>I don't really get the calls against HH though. I don't really see anything scummy coming from them, and the gambit in the beginning just strikes me as a little too... conspicuous, I guess, to be done by scum.</div></blockquote><br>\nSo Horrifying Hero's reasonless suspicion was too suspicious to be coming from scum, but Kid Know Nothing's reasonless vote was voteworthy. avasthearties completely ignored my reasonless vote. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:red\">IV.</div></div> My biggest issue with avasthearties is his take on the Yank vs. Hez exchange in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3277636#p3277636\" class=\"postlink\">post 296</a>:<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3277636#p3277636\" class=\"postlink\">avasthearties</a> wrote:</cite>Ah Christ that was a pain in the ass to read, and frankly for little value. There really wasn't much actual content to be garnered from those several back and forth pages, except for a few interesting statements like:<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>YankCane151 wrote:</cite>bobsnox: Look again. Determine again. Hez is scum, let's not look elsewhere.</div></blockquote><br>\nThat big show managed to achieve that, as it is pretty hard to look anywhere but there with several pages of arguing. Now discussion has been moved off of KKN and onto that firestorm. I don't like the result of this attention whoring, which leads me to <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">FOS: Yank</div> for now. I just find it suspicious that when the bandwagon on KKN started growing suddenly an arguement forms that overshadows everything else. Obviously Hez is responsible for that as well, but the reason it's Yank I am FOSing is simply that unusual statement above. If anything, there is the possibility that they could both be scum bussing eachother to get the heat off of KKN.</div></blockquote><br>\nTown's role in this game is to scumhunt. We do this by figuring out if a player truly believes everything they say. I have a lot of trouble believing that avasthearties actually believes what he is saying here and that is a reason why I have reached the conclusion that he is mafia. Specifically, I don't think avasthearties actually believes in the possibility of a Yank-Hez-KKN scumteam and I have many reasons for drawing this conclusion and for disliking this post otherwise, ordered from weakest to strongest:<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:red\">a.)</div></div> avasthearties begins the post by complaining about the exchange. The first two sentences of this quote seem really out of place coming from somebody who has drawn the conclusion that the two players in the exchange could possibly both be scum. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:red\">b.)</div></div> avasthearties gives Yank an FoS simply because he said he didn't want to look elsewhere. So, basically, avasthearties gave Yank an FoS for tunneling. Two problems with this: avasthearties was tunneling on Kid Know Nothing up until he made this post <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">and</div> HezLucky had the exact same attitude towards Yank, so it is odd that avasthearties didn't give Hez an FoS. Also, avasthearties' point seems like a pretty easy/weak reason to attack Yank.  <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:red\">c.)</div></div> It's pretty clear what avasthearties' real motivation is for bringing up a Yank-Hez-KKN scumteam possibility. He's trying to push a KKN mislynch and didn't like how KKN had been forgotten.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:red\">d.)</div></div> Yank and Hez being scumbuddies is, itself, a pretty crazy and unbelievable theory and avasthearties' belief that this could be the case is suspicious. However, the reason he gives for this theory is even worse. He believes that two scum partners would bus the heck out of eachother for 5 pages straight and thus put all of the attention on them just so they could get three serious votes off of their other scumbuddy. So this team would essentially be trying to put all the attention on two of their members just to remove three votes worth of attention from one of their members. <br>\n<br>\nI think that there is no way avasthearties actually believes this is possible.</fieldset><br>\n<br>\nTL;DR - avasthearties is scum, so lynch him instead. <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\">", "time": "Thu Jul 28, 2011 12:07 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=18365&start=425", "forum": "53", "thread": "18365"}

No attempt to distinguish between any of these three, or actually move a wagon is taken.<br>\n<br>\nThen there are the really wierd posts.  For example he calls CA town early, but seems to be interested in another town read (Yank) no longer thinking that CA is scum.  This is the kind of stuff you are supposed to dream of as town, two at war town reads deciding they have been wrong?  Its perfect beyond reason.<br>\n<br>\nThen there is his case on I have no idea who that is incoming apparently.  His little \"oh noez L-1\" post just makes my mane stand on end a bit as well.  Something is seriously wrong here, he has coasted this entire game adding almost nothing, while continuing to work on a post, despite clearly having kept up with this game.", "time": "Thu Jul 28, 2011 3:27 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=18365&start=425", "forum": "53", "thread": "18365"}

There is a strong case against avasthearties and he hasn't done anything to defend himself. He's at L-2 with at least three players off of his wagon who are all fine with his lynch and he's claimed to be a vanilla townie. To me, it seems like a very straight forward decision. Let's avoid making any other players claim and go with the lynch that most of the players here (even a few not voting him already) support. The worst possible outcome is we lose a vanilla townie and the scum go into the night not knowing anybody else's claim and have less of an idea as to who our powerroles are.  The best and most likely outcome is that avasthearties is scum and the scum go into the night not knowing anybody else's claim. <br>\n<br>\nIf we do go through with this lynch, I want to see HH's wall post.

He voted KKN in post 76, the top of page four, and didn't switch his vote until post 346, the bottom of page 14. A majority of the game he had his vote on KKN. And it was for a very weak reason: KKN cast a reasonless vote. This vote could have also gone to bobsnox. Also, if KKN is voteworthy for a majority of the game simply for voting without reason, then I'd think Horrifying Hero would have been nearly confirmed scum from avas's perspective (I've explained why).

He's one of my stronger suspicions but I didn't vote him because he was my top suspect. The vote was purely to add pressure while there was attention on that slot because I wanted them to actually contribute. Secondly, I posted my case against tarsonisocelot AFTER I voted HH. My case had never \"not worked out\". Nobody had suspected her prior to my reasons but I hadn't given up on that suspicion. Also, you think I'm trying to blend in?

The textbook mediation move, if you wish to call it such, would be something more along the lines of what bob did, where they call it town on town but make no attempt to really break it up, in hopes that they decide to more or less destroy themselves as scum is able to craft mid game mislynches.  I will always attempt to break people who are fighting apart, to an extent regardless of my read on him since that is my personality, the game needs to be fun, and I will provide it through my personality, roleplaying if people choose to join in especially, and making sure that others do not create a disruptive environment.

It also tries to get discussion off of a viable discussion avenue.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Twice I've seen a player claim miller and both times I think everyone agreed to just forget about the miller claim and judge that player's alignment based on their play.</div></blockquote> This reeks of scum trying to become a pack leader, trying to take control of the town. It has a scum motive, a scum intent, a scum mind-set, and is once more, artificial in its construction.<br>\n<br>\nAnd we elaborate on this in our QT. <blockquote><div><cite>QT, Paraphrased wrote:</cite>We learned nothing about anyone other than Wicked, because Wicked subtly planted the idea of completely ignoring it in the heads of others. Thereby reducing the information we could have gained from it.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Wicked wrote:</cite>I don't really think a discussion is necessary and I believe that we should just continue the game as normal. </div></blockquote> Tries to get off of the issue, quickly. Contains artificial construction: \"really\", \"necessary\", \"believe\", \"should\", \"as normal\" are all key phrases which tell us that Wicked is using carefully selected words to leave a window of escape--a way out of his current path, leaving a door open to backtrack through if necessary.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>If you are actually a miller, then I believe it was best for you to claim at this point rather than when the cop claims to have a guilty on you.</div></blockquote> This also reeks of inside knowledge. It seems Wicked knows we're town and doubts the claim. (Helpful hint--this means that the game has no godfather and therefore that any investigative role's results can be trusted 100%.)<br>\n<br>\nAdditionally, it is once more artificial in its construction, and once more, it has a lot of words which leave open a way to get out, to backtrack if necessary. This subtle paranoia is a level of overcautiousness only found in scum.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>@HezLucky-<br>\n1. I don't want any pie.<br>\n2. You've lost your scum LAZZZZZZZZER. Now how do you catch the scum? (serious question)</div></blockquote> Continues to push meaningless questions, stalling the game. This also is a serious scum Tone--\"serious question\" in parenthesis feels the need to emphasize that it's a (weak, VERY weak!) attempt at scumhunting (scum motive--trying to appear more town than he really was). Which comes out to absolutely nothing. (Scum mind-set--the question ended up being pointless.)<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Wicked wrote:</cite>Explain.</div></blockquote> This is the first incident of a consistent scum pattern, but far from the last. Asking for the reasons is fine--Wicked just did it in a Scum Tone. It is not the town-way to ask for why someone is suspicious of you (scum mind-set). This is fishing, prodding us in order to try and convince us to go elsewhere. You'll get a better idea for this later.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Yonzy wrote:</cite>Mafia, more challenging I guess. </div></blockquote> Guess what we happen to think Yonzy is? <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\"><br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Wicked wrote:</cite>It wasn't meant to be offensive.</div></blockquote>Scum being over-apologetic.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Can you elaborate/explain this please? Thanks. </div></blockquote> An attempt to look like he's scumhunting, when he really does none--it's a prod into the mind of a pro-town player, to try and extract information about that interaction (scum intention). The subtle scum Tone present here gives away that Wicked is thinking from the perspective of scum--one of the ways to tell the difference is that Wicked includes a word he has no reason to include other than trying to get on one's good side: \"Thanks.\"<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Wicked wrote:</cite>Yonzy, why no random vote? </div></blockquote> This is as blatant as scum interactions can get. It gives Yonzy a hint, while leaving open the option of bussing if need be. It also is very specific, towards a seemingly insignificant player, which is rather suspicious--why was Yonzy receiving special treatment compared to others?<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I'm going to Unvote. Vote: ConfidAnon</div></blockquote> Going after an easy mislynch. (Strong scum motive present.)<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Firstly, the point he uses against el simo seems really weak/invalid.</div></blockquote> Artificial wording once more, and leaving that back gate open if necessary for an emergency backtrack. It's quite weak itself, adding a bit of hypocrisy to it. <blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I don't see how saying he's been town in all of his other games is meant to imply he's town this game.</div></blockquote> More subtle back-gate wording, an escape route in place should he need to back away from the CA suspicion.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div> Secondly, there's no reason for him to add the phrase \"It's not a lynch-worthy case at this point, but better than an RV.\" unless he's scum giving himself room to backpedal.</div></blockquote> This is hypocritical--see how much Wicked has been adding phrases not needed? See how many back doors Wicked has in place if he needs an emergency pedal? It's pure scum Tone, plain and simple.<br>\n<br>\nThere's additionally no town mindset--Wicked's logic seems like it was distinctly formed with a scum view on the game. He's trying to look for weaknesses, not look for scumminess.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>FoS: YankCane So do you agree with ConfidAnon's point? Because you answered ConfidAnon's question for him about his point against el simo, but you haven't exactly said whether or not you agree with the point. It looks like IIoA. Suspicious.</div></blockquote> Scum motive: he's only FoS'ing Yank despite the fact that this was stronger than his ConfidAnon vote. His \"suspicious\" was unnecessary and his usage of it there only comes from a scum outlook on the game--it's artificially constructed; pure scum tone. Additionally, Yank is another easy target to pursue.<br>\n<br>\nIt's weak 'scumhunting', which looks like it is distinctly from a scum mindset, which looks like it'd take thirty seconds to throw together as scum because it's the first scum impulse.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>It still doesn't make sense. You either agree with ConfidAnon's point or you don't. If you didn't agree with it, then your post 37 seems out of place.</div></blockquote> Weak scumhunting which is fencesitting, because he refuses to take a stronger stance on Yank. Artificial construction with his careful wording choices, and a scum outlook on the game. His stance on Yank is prodding into another option, another possible voting avenue, rather than locking into his ConfidAnon suspicion.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Wicked wrote:</cite>Can this point be used against avasthearties who also answered my questions seriously?</div></blockquote> Scum posting what's essentially junk, trying to pass it off as legitimate scumhunting. It's also further going after yet ANOTHER easy target. It's pure scum motive, working under a scum mind-set, and declaring a scummy intention.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Yonzy wrote:</cite>I didnt know RVS stage was still on lol<br>\nVote: Kid Know Nothing</div></blockquote> As pointed out, this was quite suspicious. Yonzy did an RV to attempt to blend in. It is one of the strongest Wicked/Yonzy connections, too. <blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Imo it seemed liek a legit reason to vote El simo.. I would've done the same thing, and even if it wasn't, he had reason for his suspicion.. so there's really no need to vote him. </div></blockquote> Additionally, this looks like Yonzy is trying to get his scumbuddy off of ConfidAnon, through a weak defense of CA.<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3254375#p3254375\" class=\"postlink\">This REEKS of classic scum bussing</a>. The point quoted was MORE than voteworthy, compared to his incredibly weak point against ConfidAnon.<br>\nAs pointed out in our QT, it smells of scum-scum interactions, between Yonzy and Wicked. (It's no coincidence that immediately after this exchanged, we posted about Wicked literally handing us one of his scumbuddies.)<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3254381#p3254381\" class=\"postlink\">This is also fairly fluff</a>. It is artificially constructed, carefully laid out. It has a scum intention behind it (pursuing yet another avenue). More than that, it gave off a slight scum-coaching-town vibe. Mastin was quite vocal about this in the QT, and how it solidified el simo as town.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Wicked wrote:</cite>...and my suspicion of you has strengthened. You didn't agree with ConfidAnon's suspicion of el simo, but still made a post adding on to or explaining ConfidAnon's point. That makes no sense if you're town.</div></blockquote> Exact words leaving a back door open show artificial construction--\"has strengthened\", \"that makes no sense if\", things like that. His case against Yank is stronger than his case against ConfidAnon by this point, but he fails to put his vote where his mouth is, showing a scum motive. Do note however, that we say \"is stronger than his ConfidAnon case\". Not at all that it is strong. It's actually incredibly weak, as all the back door wording shows. His (scum) tone gives off the impression that he doesn't really believe anything he's saying.<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3254640#p3254640\" class=\"postlink\">This is a classic scumbuddy response</a>. In order, \"Sorry I failed you so bad.\" \"What did I do wrong?\" And then addressing Wicked again, on a random point, which he had no reason to do as town. <blockquote><div><cite>Yonzy wrote:</cite>He could have made the point to pressure him more, maybe get more answers.</div></blockquote> More than that, this is the second time Yonzy has defended a player from Wicked's attacks, in a way which screams \"weak (and subtle) distancing\".<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Yonzy wrote:</cite>sooo nobody is telling me what I did </div></blockquote> This is a far more blatant, \"what did I do wrong?!?\". <blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I posted what I thinkkk why/how am I giving scumvibes?</div></blockquote> This furthers that, by essentially looking to improve his play. Additionally, this is a dead-ringer for Wicked asking, \"explain\" in its purpose--scum prodding town, essentially. As <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3259258#p3259258\" class=\"postlink\">bob pointed out</a>, Yonzy was overall far more concerned with self-defense rather than scumhunting.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Wicked wrote:</cite>Firstly, Hez only said that one of my points wasn't a fair scumtell. He didn't call the whole case unfair.</div></blockquote> Defending Hez. In this situation, it comes from a scum mind-set, with a pure scum motive and brilliant scum intention. It deprives Hez of answering, while simultaneously getting Yank all riled up on Hez, getting Yank to further attack Hez. It also weakly attacks Yank back, something Wicked doesn't follow through on, but leaves open. (Sound familiar? It should--this is becoming a signature Wicked move: leaving open doors that a pro-town player would close.)<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Secondly, while I don't agree/support this point, if you honestly believe in it, why didn't you bring it up earlier? And if you found it voteworthy, why didn't you vote him until now?</div></blockquote> Exact wording, for the back door. \"while\" \"don't agree/support\", \"honestly believe\", \"until\". Essentially, Scum Tone, Artificially constructed. Also an attempt to pass something off as legitimate scumhunting, when it really is a load of junk. (Scum motive.)<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>@Yonzy - What originally made you think that the RVS was over? The facepalm was because you didn't random vote in the RVS stage and when the game got serious you did random vote. Is there anybody you suspect at this stage of the game? Why?</div></blockquote> This is about as blatant as Scum-Coaching-Scum can get. It leaves the door open to Yonzy, but at the same time, paints him in a more positive light than his original interaction implied.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Read the thread again, please. My vote on ConfidAnon is serious. Not random. And even if you had acted more suspicious than him I wouldn't unvote until ConfidAnon had responded to the vote and defended himself. </div></blockquote> 1: Scum tone. Seriously bad scum tone. \"again, <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">please</div>\", \"serious. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Not random.</div>\", \"even if\", \"acted\", \"more suspicious\". All of these words (and in the case of the bolded, the particular ways of emphasizing them--please at the end of the sentence rather than the beginning, a period rather than a comma for the emphasis), combined, are carefully constructed.<br>\n<br>\n2: poor justification of his reasons. He feels the need to point out that his vote is serious, he feels the need to justify not having switched, he feels the need to justify still being on the dead wagon. Speaking of which...<br>\n<br>\n3: Admitting to staying on an overall stale wagon.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>...because, IIRC, Dizzy hasn't even made a post outside of the confirmation stage. </div></blockquote> Looks like scum defending buddy.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Care to actually explain your reads?</div></blockquote> Again, this is exactly the same scum way of asking that he did earlier, and Yonzy also displayed. It has a scum Motive behind it in the need for elaboration (\"all the better to manipulate you with, my dear\"), has a particular scum mind-set displayed in the Tone, unique to scum players.<br>\n<br>\nOne of the best ways to describe this tone is to compare it to a similar tone from scum: the \"I CAN'T BELIEVE I'VE BEEN CAUGHT FOR ALL OF THESE *BEEP* REASONS!\"<br>\n<br>\nThe relation here being that the scum see a significant need for reasons. The scum need to understand the reasoning of a pro-town player, because it's in their best interest to avoid getting caught. The scum want to avoid the things which players show suspicion of. They want to manipulate the town. They have a specific purpose, a specific need, for the reasons to be explained.<br>\n<br>\nThe town acts more curiously, more intrigued by the reads of another. They don't necessarily want the information--they're just naturally inquisitive.<br>\n<br>\nAdditionally, Wicked was also asking KKN about Yonzy, which is a slight Yonzy/Vifam defense.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>That might be useful.</div></blockquote> Though he can't explain it logically (gut), Mastin believes this to be Pure scum tone.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Mastin, if you are so certain that I'm scum, why not try to convince others to vote for me or explain why you are voting me?</div></blockquote> There is no greater scumtell than a player who is familiar with the old '09-style Mastin than asking for Mastin to explain himself.<br>\n<br>\nWicked was asking Mastin, specifically. Not us, the hydra Horrifying Hero. Not Lat. He asked, specifically, Mastin to explain himself. He should KNOW better than to ask it of Mastin--he's familiar with the easily-self-destructing Mastin and a question like that is trying to provoke Mastin.<br>\n<br>\nAdditionally, this was also one of Lat's strongest scum-reads on Wicked, because Lat thought, paraphrased, \"town wouldn't be this passive aggressive. Town response would be, 'wait, hold on, why do you think I'm scum'. Town would be naturally suspicious, but Wicked just accepts it. He waited until it was acceptable to attack us.\"<br>\n<br>\nWhich holds mostly true. Wicked basically was saying he thinks (no, make that knows) we're town and wanted to get rid of us.<br>\n<br>\nIt is very carefully constructed in the way most meant to provoke a reaction, a reaction which Wicked can twisted and bend to his will. That kind of artificial construction can only come from scum.<br>\n<br>\nContrast with Lobster's version, soon after. <blockquote><div><cite>Lobster wrote:</cite>can you explain this?</div></blockquote> This was done naturally, from a town mind-set and no manipulation was involved. It was a pure thought, unfiltered, undistorted, uncensored, direct from Lobster's mind. Wicked's wasn't, as clearly demonstrated above.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Wicked wrote:</cite>If you were a townie in his position, how would you have phrased his question?</div></blockquote> This comes off as scum defending town, while weakly attacking town. (Strong scum motive, in that it furthers an attack on town and creates an intentional red herring with a pro-town player.) It's also artificially constructed and gives very little actual content.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Wicked wrote:</cite>Before I elaborate on and defend my point against you, can you please explain what the purpose of your vote for el simo was, originally?</div></blockquote>Pure scum Intention, pure scum Motive. Wicked leaves open a huge door, and subtly traps ConfidAnon into being forced on the offensive-defense, by forcing ConfidAnon to make the first move, rather than taking the initiative. This permits Wicked to compile evidence more easily against ConfidAnon and better attack him as a mislynch.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I never said that joking was a scumtell. Did you actually think I was saying that? LobsterCatapult explained this point pretty well and I can't think of a better way to elaborate on it, so I'll just quote it for you since you ignored it anyway:</div></blockquote> This displays a scum tone--it is carefully constructed and rather artificial (\"never said\", \"actually think\", \"pretty well\", \"can't think\", \"better way\", etc.), it contains some blatant buddying to Lobster, and shows a scum intention, once more by furthering a weak offense and buddying to town.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Some VCA wrote:</cite>Kid Know Nothing - 3 (YankCane151, <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Yonzy</div>, avasthearties)<br>\nConfidAnon - 3 (<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Wickedestjr</div>, LobsterCatapult, hezlucky)</div></blockquote>When you combine these lead two wagons, it comes to being L-1. You expect 1-2 scum to be present. Naturally, it should be one per wagon, and I've bolded the obvious choices which stand out from each of them.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Wicked wrote:</cite>I'm not a fan of avasthearties play so far. </div></blockquote> Scum Tone. It's artificially constructed. More than that, Wicked has left a back door to pedal through. (\"not a fan\".) It also has scum Motive, in that avasthearties is an easy mislynch. <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Correct me if I'm wrong. You asked HezLucky the question, then, before HezLucky had responded, I asked you who you suspect. You voted HezLucky and explained your point before HezLucky answered your question. If I'm correct, why did you wait until after I asked about your suspicions before you voted? I might be a little bit confused. </div></blockquote> This displays some of the worst back dooring there can be. \"might be a little bit confused\"? You either are or aren't confused; there's no \"might\" in it. \"correct me\", \"if I'm correct\", \"might\" and \"little\". It's is artificially constructed, has a scum tone to it. More than that, it is pursuing a very weak suspect, leaving open another door.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>If you're right, then that would explain why they believe Yonzy is my scumbuddy</div></blockquote> \"if\", \"that would\", \"they believe\". More leaving room for a back door.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>It isn't irrelevant. I questioned Yonzy because he made a post in the RVS that didn't have a random vote. Dizzy never made any posts in the RVS so if I were to question him I would just be asking him why he hasn't been posting. And for all I know, Dizzy would have cast a random vote if he had made a post outside of the RVS. </div></blockquote> Once more, this defense of Dizzy reads as blatant defense of his buddy.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Whose ISO did you read instead?</div></blockquote> Artificial construction, scum intention via pursuing another possible direction--again, Wicked's leaving open a ton of Doors. Wicked's made pretty much no calls of a player town, and pretty much no hints of it other than possibly Hez. He's essentially been calling everyone a suspect, leaving open any mislynch he were to choose. Speaking of which...<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Wicked wrote:</cite>Unvote. Vote: tarsonisocelot.</div></blockquote> He goes for yet another easy wagon. (Inside tarsonis's sig she even SAYS she's a VI!) Can't get more scum in your intention than this.<br>\n<br>\nJumping back a little, <blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>So do you suspect Yonzy and why? Also, what do you consider an overreaction and what does a player overreacting to your vote say about that player's alignment?</div></blockquote> This is an artificial scum tone. \"So\", \"do\", \"and why\", \"consider\", etc. Additionally, it shows scum intention, by prodding KKN. More than that, it shows scum motive, in this case, to defend Yonzy. It contains pretty much no legitimate scumhunting. Put bluntly, it has that distinctive scum mind-set.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I like both YankCane151 and ConfidAnon's reaction to my suspicions of them. Also, I'm no longer interested in arguing with them at this point (I'm aware that I seem to be beating a dead horse and if I continued questioning them I don't think it would get us anywhere). </div></blockquote> And suddenly, a reversal of BOTH his main suspects, out of seemingly nowhere. It's a pure scum motive and mind-set, revealing he knows both Yank and CA are town. It's a scum intention, in that he's intentionally trying to get below their radars because they're both becoming somewhat suspicious of him. It's also artificially constructed--it has a lot of backpedalling room, should the need arise. \"like\", \"no longer\", \"at this point\", etc.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Wicked wrote:</cite>So what do you guys think about tarsonisocelot?</div></blockquote> Pure scum motive, prodding around to see if he'll have support. I'm willing to bet Wicked didn't have a case on Tarsonis before this, and was looking to see if there might be some interest.<br>\n<br>\nWicked's essentially been consistently searching the town for the ways to best pull their strings, the ways best to manipulate the situation to his advantage, the ways to most stay out of sight while pushing a scum agenda.<br>\n<br>\nLobster pointed this out, essentially, but was probably convinced by Wicked's \"Oh, crud, they caught on to it\" response of <blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I want to see who agreed with me and could explain why without parroting my reasoning.</div></blockquote> Which is itself a horrendously bad excuse, because it could also mean he was trying to get others' to give THEIR reasons so he could parrot THEM. It's also artificially constructed, but despite his best efforts, he let through a slight tint of scum panicking in there, that Lobster was catching on.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>He voted KKN in post 76 just because he didn't give a reason for his Yonzy vote. Not really a strong point and it feels like he was going after an easy target at that point.</div></blockquote> This is once more leaving many back doors to pedal through. It's artificially constructed, and gives off a scum tone. It also is a very weak explanation of his actions.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Wicked wrote:</cite>Y'know what. I really like the HH bandwagon- even better than my tarsonisocelot vote. Unvote. Vote: Horrifying Hero </div></blockquote> This is blatant bandwagonning. It also contains a scum tone, and is carefully constructed. (\"y'know\", \"really like\" \"even better\", etc.) It gives off the paranoid feeling, that Wicked feels he needs to explain himself well to justify the change.<br>\n<br>\nIt's also blatant OMGUS. (Scum mind-set.)<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>-They've stated two suspicions but haven't explained either of them and haven't made any effort to convince others to follow their vote for me. </div></blockquote> This is once more a careful artificial construction, scum tone written all over it--\"stated\", \"explained\", \"effort\", \"convince\", \"follow\", etc. More than that, the game had just begun by that point, one head was V/LA, and the other head was busy elsewhere. Furthermore, by saying this, he is hoping to weaken the support we would otherwise have gained (scum motive). <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>-They haven't posted a lot recently. This is especially strange considering they were pretty active the day the game started. </div></blockquote> Related to the above, he failed to note (flat-out ignoring, in fact) the detail that we were both preoccupied with other affairs. Additionally, it contains back doors. \"a lot\", \"recently\", \"especially\", \"considering\", \"pretty\" \"the day\".<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>-They are a miller. That, itself, isn't suspicious, but a miller's allignment can't be determined via cop investigation. So we determine their allignment based solely on their play during the day. Horrifying Hero, however, is giving us hardly anything to work with. They're playing with their cards too close to their chest. That isn't the way that a miller should be playing this game. </div></blockquote> Scum inside knowledge--Wicked gave off the impression he knew our claim was false, a deduction he'd only make with a Scum Mind-set and the informed minority's bonus intel on what the setup is (roughly) like.<br>\n<br>\nAdditionally, it is artificially constructed--it has a scum tone in it: there's a lot of back door wording, leaving a way out (do we need to point out these words every single time?). It also has a scum Motive, declaring a scum intent: he once more wants to force us to make the move, to put the pressure on us rather than him.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I still suspect tarsonisocelot, but I'm not explaining why until 2-3 more players post in the thread.</div></blockquote> Again, this is carefully constructed. Wicked is prodding the town to see what they'll respond to, is looking for the strings to manipulate things. He's leaving open any number of doors for tarsonis, and wants feedback before he makes a conclusion. Scum intention, artificial posting, leaving too many doors open.<br>\n<br>\nWhen we said after we unclaimed that Wicked was caught scum, we really did mean that Wicked was, indeed, caught scum who was living breathing scum in every post.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>More VCA wrote:</cite>Kid Know Nothing - 5 (YankCane151, Yonzy, avasthearties, bobsnox, el simo)<br>\nHorrifying Hero - 3 (Lobster Catapult, ConfidAnon, Wickedestjr)<br>\nWickedestjr - 1 (Horrifying Hero)<br>\nel simo - 1 (tarsonisocelot)<br>\navasthearties - 1 (Kid Know Nothing)<br>\nConfidAnon - 1 (hezlucky)<br>\nNot voting: Dizzle.</div></blockquote> One scum on all the main wagons. That is, one scum on KKN (Yonzy), one scum on us (Wicked), and one scum in all of the (1) wagons combined, including \"not voting\". (Dizzle.)<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Wicked wrote:</cite>Then how are we supposed to determine your allignment? </div></blockquote> Scum tone--It's artificially constructed. \"then\", \"how\", \"are\", \"supposed\", \"determine\", everything in there carefully selected to maximize the impact. It shows a distinct scum motive as well. He wants us to put our cards down, immediately, so that he can counter them and take control.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Answer the question, please. </div></blockquote> This is once more scum tone, only stronger. (\"please\", mainly) It also displays a scum motive--refer to him wanting control.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>And how did your fakeclaim tell you all that? </div></blockquote> Strong, Stronger, Strongest. Scum tone. It again shows a scum motive, in that he's prodding for the sort of information he can manipulate as scum to get the game best under his control.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>You might be interested in taking a look at my previous games. </div></blockquote> Scum tone, though not as strong as the previous incidents of it--artificially constructed. Additionally, Wicked is using meta to defend himself. (Meta can be manipulated.)<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Wicked wrote:</cite>I don't believe that you are capable of doing this. Try and prove me wrong.</div></blockquote>So, have we missed any posts? We're pretty sure we've delivered on the \"bleeding scum in every single post\" part of our claim for you being scum. <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\";)\" title=\"Wink\"><br>\n<br>\nHeck, in this post alone, we've got scumtells. For starters, there's the artificial construction of the post. In addition to that, there's a scum tone in Wicked's taunt. Said taunt is a deliberate scum intention, because it shows a scum motive--trying to provoke a response from us.<br>\n<br>\nAs mentioned previously, Wicked is well aware that one of the players in this Hydra is Mastin, and a player who knows Mastin from 2009 provoking Mastin is one of Mastin's greatest scumtells, because back then, Mastin was easily caught in that type of trap.<br>\n<br>\nIt also displays a distinctive scum mind-set. What town player wants to provoke another town player?<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Wicked wrote:</cite>Okay sure. Sorry for referring to you as him.

Any thoughts regarding the game. tarsonisocelot hasn't given us anything to work with and aside from 2-3 questions (there was no follow-up to the only answered question), hasn't done any scumhunting. She's scum.</div></blockquote> For starters--the way Wicked built up this case, it looked like it was actually going to be something large. Contrast with our wall here, which is every bit as long as we promised.<br>\n<br>\nHe also has that over-apologetic approach to Tarsonis. It gives off the distinct feeling of additionally not being so much a case as \"scum-coaching-town\". It's also a very weak case against Tarsonis. It additionally is extremely artificial, constructed once more in a strategic fashion.<br>\n<br>\nFurthermore, he shows a scum tone in these posts. He displays a scum intention by going after a weak suspect, and a scum motive by wording things carefully--particularly in his last paragraph. It leaves a lot of back doors, to pedal out of if necessary.<br>\n<br>\nIt's also an extremely scum mind-set, by trying to single out her among many others, disregarding others who had contributed equally as little--Yonzy, for instance, had no suspects and did no scumhunting, yet got no more than a single abandoned FoS.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Wicked wrote:</cite>Hmm.... I like ConfidAnon's points against YankCane. ConfidAnon, what do you think of tarsonisocelot after reading my points against him?</div></blockquote> This is once more artificially constructed. It contains that back door to escape from, in that it contains those key words to leave open the chance to change his mind. Additionally, it shows pure scum motive, in that he's further prodding ConfidAnon to see what he can use against all three players--CA, tarsonis, AND Yank.<br>\n<br>\nOn a side-note, <blockquote><div><cite>tarsonis wrote:</cite>I do have a bad feeling about Wicked, but I want to wait a few RL days before deciding if that's actually merited by the tone/content of their posts or whether it's a knee-jerk reaction to them voting for me while saying \"I have a case and I won't tell you!\".<br>\nMaybe yonzy, the \"Is it still RVS? I didn't notice! vote:random\" thing was odd.</div></blockquote> Everyone should be ashamed. Tarsonis does better scumhunting in this post than most people have done for the entire game.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Rainbowdash wrote:</cite>I realize that we have some Derpy Hooves types like Yonzy here that are more of a threat to themselves than friendship, but a few others are getting by much more slyly.<br>\n<br>\nVote Kid Know Nothing<br>\n<br>\nHe has done nothing useful in this game but attempt to trap people with shadows of overaggression when its actually pro-town to ask questions about why votes exist. He also is passively attacking punching bag Derpy, which is far more mallicious than voting for them. It feels like egging a wagon on, when that would best be served by actually voting there. Now I know everyone is going to be all like \"But Rainbow, he already is voting for somepony!\". Well yeah he is, but he is doing nothing to further that case, just sitting on it.</div></blockquote> This is what instantly convinced us that Rainbowdash was the third scum. For starters, Rainbow defends Yonzy as being idiot-town. Furthermore, the vote for KKN is for reasons which can better be applied to Wicked. (See also: our massive case so far against Wicked.) Everything said against KKN here, in fact, looks like it could (and very well might have been!) be on Wicked. (Who knows, maybe it was and Rainbow switched names at the last second to decide not to bus.)<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Rainbow wrote:</cite>You are sitting on a nonexistant case. What you are pushing them for is that they reacted like scum would react to somepony throwing out a vote without any reasoning by voting for them AND asking questions about a baseless vote. If that is the scum reaction, what the hay is the town reaction? Blindly bandwagoning you? Ignoring the vote? Asking questions but NOT voting you?<br>\n<br>\nSomepony must have been kicked in the head as a filly. Or is a threat to the magic of friendship.</div></blockquote> Wicked is not the only one in this game who displays an artificial tone. Rainbowdash's post here definitely contained it. It gives a \"scum-coaching-town\" feel to it. It also feels weak.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Like give me a paragraph on why someone in this game is mafia. In their next post. Or suffer wrath.</div></blockquote> Scum tone. Mastin says that he believes it's the usage of full stops, but isn't sure. He just knows it's a scum tone.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>So you are supposed to call somepony out on it WITHOUT a vote to be town and WITH a vote to be scummy?</div></blockquote> It appears that in the absence of Wicked, Rainbow has stolen all of his scumtells. This has scum tone, it's artificial, it now has a clear back door, it has a scum motive in that it's prodding town and looking for things to use against them.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>He is. I have seen his type enough to know that regardless of everything he is going to come off as Derpy Hooves and get lynched or vig shot in most games. You just can't put much trust in them, much like that one time we sent that one pony that couldn't tell directions to go help the birds migrate, learned that one the hard way. Anyways, he should be replaced since he hasnt even posted for almost five days. </div></blockquote> Contradiction--Rainbow had earlier implied a town-view on Yonzy. This makes it clearly null. Also employs that back door.<br>\n<br>\nIt's like the scum have a constant rear view mirror and have their hands on the gear, ready to shift into reverse without so much as a moment's hesitation.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nWe got so sick of how scummy this post was (post 162, on page seven) that we decided to skip it for later, as it was just that bad for us. We never came back, due to time restraints, but it is a rather horrible post.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Rainbow wrote:</cite>They have purpose if utilized corretly, but I really don't think this falls under that category since from what you are trying to argue. Your first vote wasn't scummy at all either, it wasnt a good time and place for it, but that wasnt something that caused any concern, it was the follow up of it.</div></blockquote> Screw leaving a back door. Rainbow is ramming through it in full reverse--this goes beyond leaving open a chance to backpedal; it IS backpedaling.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>What are the town reactions? The scum reactions? Remember what I said about how everpony is different in their reactions and mindset? I sincerely doubt that this will manage to catch scum at a greater rate then scum exist in the game.</div></blockquote> Scum motive--prodding town once more. Additionally, more back door wording.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Is this really one of those \"I wouldnt have done this if I was scum\" comments?</div></blockquote> Scum tone, via the back door.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>@Hez/Yank - Ok, stop arguing now. Everpony gets the points and can decide for ourselves. Weigh in on other things.</div></blockquote> 1: Scumslip. It reveals that both Hez and Yank are town. 2: Artificial scum tone, in the way that Rainbow is asking them to contribute elsewhere, in that it has a scum motive. (See also: prodding town to see what can be used against them.)<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Best VCA Ever wrote:</cite>Kid Know Nothing - 5 (Yonzy, avasthearties, bobsnox, el simo, Rainbowdash)<br>\nHorrifying Hero - 2 (Lobster Catapult, Wickedestjr)<br>\nYankCane151 - 2 (ConfidAnon, HezLucky)</div></blockquote> One to two scum on the KKN mislynch. Better yet, I think it's at the beginning and end of the wagon. This is further backed up by the fact that el simo is town, and bob and avas are both strong town-reads of ours.<br>\n<br>\nThere's also one scum in the (2) voters, which can only be Wicked. This clears Lobster (obviously), Hez (obv-town anyway), and ConfidAnon. (Less obvious, but still present.)<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Vifam wrote:</cite>Who should I vote?</div></blockquote> There's nothing wrong with this.<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Us, responding wrote:</cite>Wicked, naturally.</div></blockquote><br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Vifam wrote:</cite>If that's true why is there a wagon on KKN?</div></blockquote> ...Until you combine it with this.<br>\n<br>\nVifam confirmed that Vifam's scum with Wicked due to this.<br>\n<br>\nTown response to being told who to vote: blindly following and voting the first name called out. (I called out Wicked.)<br>\nScum response to being told to vote someone who is town: voting the person who is town.<br>\nScum response to being told to vote for scumbuddy:<br>\n<br>\nTo question the logic behind the choice. Which Vifam just did. It's one of the strongest scumtells applicable to this situation. Vifam essentially trapped himself with one of his first posts, without realizing the damage he was doing.<br>\n<br>\nTo paraphrase what went on, Vifam: \"Hi. Tell me who to vote.\" \"Wicked.\" \"On second thought, I take it back--not voting.\"<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Rainbow wrote:</cite>Wake me when it gets here. You have been holding out on a case of him since the first page.</div></blockquote> Mastin says Scum tone. He can't explain it. (Gut.)<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Vifam wrote:</cite>Don't be a cunt.</div></blockquote> Pointless insult, deflection, provocation.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Okay<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">FOS:HezLucky/b]<br>\n<br>\nI skimmed through the thread, I think I might open up on a case of him being scum.</div></div></blockquote> Refuses to take a stronger stance, and scumslips with his back-door wording by revealing he knows Hez is town. Gives a FoS (suspicion) on Hez, implying he thinks Hez is scum. Yet only \"might open up on a case of him being scum\", which says that he isn't that suspicious of Hez at the moment, not enough to warrant an FoS. (Generally, if you have an FoS, you're the one making/quoting the case, not waiting for it!)<br>\n<br>\nAdditionally, it shows lack of initiative and willingness to sheep a case, no matter how weak it might be, and not put any original thought into Vifam's suspicion of Hez. This accusation is augmented by the next post, <blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Yank pretty much nailed it.</div></blockquote> But there's more to Vifam's post than just that.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I'm going to take my scumhunting elsewhere.</div></blockquote> So, instead of trying to focus on a target, Vifam chooses to branch out and now follow through on the vote, instead opting to look elsewhere. This is a pure scum mind-set, as there's no town reason to not focus on your primary suspect. It shows a scum motive, in that Vifam is looking for other potential mislynch targets to pin besides Hez.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Vifam wrote:</cite>Holy shit.<br>\n<br>\nThis game just got emotional.</div></blockquote>This was basically fluff, meant to be passed off as an attempt to defuse the situation. Only, it didn't. It added nothing.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Rainbowdash wrote:</cite>Seriously<br>\n<br>\nNo fighting, yes friendship. This WILL work itself out. I can bring up some great stories about how competition can get in the way of friendships if you want.</div></blockquote> It's like Rainbow is looking at his scum partners and singing, \"anything you can do, I can do betteeeeeeeer, anything you can do, I can do too!\" Mastin says This also has a scum tone to it, but he doesn't want to waste time explaining it so will allow it to be called gut.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Lynch pool today is KKN and Tarin (could also be swayed to el simo). One we get one of those flips we can move on from there. Right now this is going to become a black hole that will draw everypony into it by dominating discussion. Hez is being AMAZINGLY stubborn to the point where he is threatening anypony who attack him, even moreso then Yank who needs to drop his case at this point and move on.</div></blockquote> Rainbow is lining up mislynches here. All three of KKN, Tarsonis, and el simo are town for various (but quite obvious when you look for them) reasons.<br>\n<br>\nHis attempt to defuse the situation reads as instead trying to actually subtly encourage it. Like trying to fight a Forest Fire by dumping gasoline on it--it might initially appear to be dousing the flames and calming things down, but it's actually fueling the flames further.<br>\n<br>\nIt has an overall scum tone to it, in the way it was worded came from a scum mind-set encouraging the fighting.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Because he is probably town, and you are probably town, and if everypony would realize that the best way to deal with a situation like this one is to diffuse it, use a lynch flip then followed by the night actions to learn more about the ponies in the arguement its better. You are not allowed to argue \"more stubborn\" either as a reason to carry on an attack, this isnt eye for and eye and hoof for a hoof.</div></blockquote> This is a minor backtrack, in that Rainbow is no longer showing the same level of confidence in both being town. Instead of strongly implying it, Rainbow's now only saying it kinda weak, by comparison. It's also false, in that a lynch elsewhere would not shed any light on either combatant's alignment. (Well, it would--Rainbow/Vifam as scum would reveal them both to be town. Other than that...)<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Lynch pool is two because those are my two strongest scum reads. Their flips catch scum and/or clear up reads on neutral players while cementing stronger reads.</div></blockquote> This is also false, and blatantly trying to control the town. The second part is self-evident. As for the names, the players who reveal the most are not KKN (who was obv-town via the quick L-2 wagon), Tarsonis (who has connections to literally nobody), or even el simo (...less so, admittedly, in that el simo's town-flip somewhat-condemns Wicked, but not that much). The players revealing the most are Wicked and Yonzy/Vifam.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Also please tell me you are kidding with Anon scum. I mean, if thats serious you are making Derpy look like Twilight.</div></blockquote> Scum tone: Degrading the quality of another's scumhunting, while casting weak suspicion on them shows a very strong scum motive, with a good scum intention as well.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>@bob - There we go. Voice of reason. While HH is more of an unpredicatble entity in this game, they arent a great lynch. The continual ignoring of the game is a slight tell, especially given that mastin is known for being one of the more overboard posters and Lat is definantly competent. Just would rather go in a different direction</div></blockquote> Classic examples of both fencesitting and buddying. It displays a strong scum motive, as well as a slight scum tone--comes across as being artificially constructed.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I see Hez has come around. Good. We can start to move on.</div></blockquote> Scum tone, which reveals the scum intention behind this.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Vifam wrote:</cite>What purpose was this going to serve? Do you actually think he is scum? Or are you actually trying to apply some pressure on him?<br>\n<br>\nIf it's the former, what makes you think he is scum over KKN?<br>\n<br>\nIf it's the latter, what makes you think he will hurry if he's been holding out for this long?<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nI don't see what made you want to hop on this joke, since I've read HH's ISO, and he's doing some MAJOR foreshadowing, so I think it's best to just wait. If his proof is inconclusive, this vote would be justified. But at the moment a HH lynch seems rushed and not very well thought out.</div></blockquote> Artificial construction: Scum tone--Back Door Wording--Vifam is leaving a LOT of room to backpedal out of here if need be. Scum intention--this prod declares things that only can come from scum wanting to foreshadow their own future votes.<br>\n<br>\nScum motive, too, in that prodding Bob like this simultaneously tests grounds for an HH mislynch and a Bob mislynch, to see if either can get support. (Which itself is a scumslip revealing Bob to be town.)<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Vifam wrote:</cite>There is probably scum on the KKN wagon, we should put some of our thought there.</div></blockquote> ...Yet Vifam was ON the KKN wagon for a significant amount of time.<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3275869#p3275869\" class=\"postlink\">His name is included</a>. Vifam refuses to state WHO the scum are in there, instead referring to the general, \"there has to be scum in there\". Yet Vifam refuses to state why.<br>\n(LINK ABOVE INTENTIONALLY BROKEN DUE TO QUICKTOPIC'S ANNOYING FOUR-LINK LIMIT; THIS WILL NEED FIXING.)<br>\nAnd I think I know why. His buddy is in there. He could safely say, \"excluding me\", and focus on the other four--but he doesn't, because he knows it'll cast more suspicion onto Rainbowdash. Instead of focusing on these four, his vote's outside the wagon, on Hez.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Rainbowdash wrote:</cite>His ISO.<br>\n<br>\nIt continually shifts viewpoint not to go along with the pacing of the game but instead to respond to point that are made for and against people being scum, without showing any real motivation to move towards or away from certain players baselessly which tend to be indicative of scum. The only way I start to secondguess this read is with a Tarin-scum flip, even then though, he is a leaning town player.</div></blockquote> This seems weaker than Rainbow's defense of him. In other words, it seems like Rainbow shouldn't have this strong of a town-read for that little. (Scum mind-set.) Which makes me think Rainbow scumslipped. Additionally, it contains an artificial construction, leaving multiple back doors to trail through if need be. Scum intention, too, by leaving open the wagon options.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I want to diffuse this because its massively counter intuitive and if you guys really are both town, exactly what scum want to create and will thrive off of in these games, which is why we are going to stop it. Bob either realizes this, or doesnt realize it and still has come to the correct path of action.</div></blockquote> This comes from a scum mind-set, in that town don't think of a townVtown situation in this way. It reeks of scum trying to get town-cred for stopping the situation being described. It has an extremely forced, artificial feel to it.<br>\n<br>\nAdditionally, the bob part contains back door wording, in that Rainbow is leaving open a backtrack on bob being a voice of reason to use if a chance to take advantage of bob presents itself (doubling as a scum intention).<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nThis is where we stopped, sorry, due to time constraints. Our apologies for taking so long and only covering half of the game.

It's a good comparison of what a productive townie would do versus scum pretending to be productive.<br>\n<br>\nWicked's also scum for not having claimed--You're at L-1. Why the heck wouldn't you claim as town?<br>\nAs scum, there's clear motivation--talk your way out of a lynch, and you can save claiming for later. You don't have to lock a claim in.<br>\nAs town, there's no motivation.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nMiscellaneous Extras:<br>\nThese are things which'd be worked into the case at the appropriate spots if we had more time.

You don't talk WITH your suspects, unless you WANT them to convince you they're town.<br>\n<br>\nWicked isn't posting about Yank per say, in words he is, but his intention is different.

Wicked's play has degenerated to the point where he isn't even TRYING to scum hunt anymore. Paragraph One is preposterous. First off, We don't negotiate with scum. Next, what kind of Cop thinks like this? Wicked's agenda is purely based on upping his survival time for the sake of investigations. The problem here is that in Wicked's agenda, His Survival &gt; REAL Scum Hunting. Look! Instead of persuading of us his townie motivations he outright says \"lol since im scum you shouldn't lynch me because i haz investigation!\"<br>\n<br>\nHis argument for survival is based on chance. This is what we call WIFOM. And this is very important! The argument for not lynching Wicked isn't even based on any type of analysis or reading his motivations. It's based on fucking WIFOM. Wicked-Scum isn't even arguing about how could bring scum to justice to prove his innocence, he isn't stating that he will give thorough reads like a REAL townie should do. He just wants to fake more investigations to live longer.<br>\n<br>\nNow, paragraph two is more scummy gold. Appeal to fuckin authority when he has none. Discrediting Hez's reads based on his uncertainty. These are tied together into one very important fact.<br>\n<br>\nHez was correct about Vifam-Scum while Wicked wasn't even trying to read him. And Wicked STILL asserts that Hez should be lacking confidence and turn to WICKED'S <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">expert</div> authority.

Voting five out of the twelve people in the game is a lot, sure counting it up it's not majority but it's a significant number and considering the sheer number of people you voted the fact that your vote never landed on Avas or Vifam is highly revealing. I've taken a step back, relooked at my case and your refrainment from voting Vifam and Avas isn't wifom at all, heck it's not even near the defnition of wifom but nice attempt to decredit the case against you by throwing a catch-phrase like wifom out there.<br>\n<br>\nThere seriously needs to be more votes on Lobster or Avas.", "time": "Wed Aug 17, 2011 3:25 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=18365&start=675", "forum": "53", "thread": "18365"}

{"number": 768, "id": "3369111", "user": "Wickedestjr", "user_id": "10668", "content": "Okay, so originally I strongly believed that avasthearties was scum, but now, after looking at interactions and actually taking the Vifam scumflip into account, I've found stronger evidence. The remaining scum are tarsonisocelot and el simo. If I'm wrong about that, then avasthearties is almost definitely scum, but I'm pretty sure it's right. Below I've commented on all the telling interactions between Yonzy/Vifam and each of my top four suspects. I noticed a very strong connection between el simo and tarsonisocelot but I'll get to that later. I've made you guys wait long enough and it's time for me to post what I have, now. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: normal; display: inline\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vifam/Yonzy + avasthearties:</div></div> </div><br>\n<br>\nFirstly, avasthearties comments regarding Vifam/Yonzy. At the end of day 1 I posted a case against avasthearties which partially had to do with his <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3277636#p3277636\" class=\"postlink\">comments on vifam/Yonzy</a> which I felt were unusual/awkward and came out of nowhere. I have no idea why he mentioned Vifam/Yonzy in the post in question unless he was scum who felt obligated to comment on his scumbuddy. <br>\n <br>\nSecondly, Vifam's posts. He's shown that <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3276304#p3276304\" class=\"postlink\">he's aware of avasthearties' coasting and lack of contribution</a>, but for some reason <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3276232#p3276232\" class=\"postlink\">he didn't think avasthearties was an option we should have directed our scumhunting towards</a>. Vifam and avasthearties could be connected. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: normal; display: inline\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vifam/Yonzy + el simo:</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\nYonzy defends ConfidAnon's post 35 where he votes el simo. He says:<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Yonzy wrote:</cite>Imo it seemed liek a legit reason to vote El simo.. I would've done the same thing, and even if it wasn't, he had reason for his suspicion.. so there's really no need to vote him.</div></blockquote><br>\nThis sounds like somebody that knows el simo is scum and that ConfidAnon is right to vote him. Yonzy says he would've done the same thing, but he was the first player to post after el simo's supposed AtE and didn't pay any attention to it. Even after it was pointed out Yonzy doesn't vote for el simo nor does he even express suspicion of him. This is weird considering he wasn't seriously voting or suspecting anybody else (in fact, this was the same post he placed his late RVS vote <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\">).<br>\n<br>\nSecondly, Vifam said that el simo was one of the options he thought was worth looking into, however, he never (unless I missed something) interacted with el simo. This could be because he was scum, but he did interact with his other two suspects, LobsterCatapult and bobsnox. <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3276304#p3276304\" class=\"postlink\">Vifam called el simo's vote for KKN opportunistic</a>, but there was no followup even after <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3276877#p3276877\" class=\"postlink\">el simo elaborated on the vote for KKN</a>. You could say this was because Vifam was scum, but if that's the case, why did he get in an exchange with his other suspect, bobsnox, who was town?<br>\n<br>\nThirdly, <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3278415#p3278415\" class=\"postlink\">el simo expresses suspicion of Vifam but isn't capable of explaining why</a>. If you read through his iso, you'll notice he never does explain which shows a lack of interest in Vifam which is odd considering all the attention Vifam was getting at the end of day 1.      <br>\n<br>\nFinally, I have trouble seeing the Vifam bandwagon be an all town bandwagon considering the speed of it. This was the final votecount of day 1:<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Amor wrote:</cite>Day 1 Final Votecount<br>\n<br>\nVifam - 7 (Rainbowdash, ConfidAnon, YankCane151, HezLucky, HorrifyingHero, el simo, Wickedestjr)<br>\nRainbowdash - 1 (bobsnox)<br>\navasthearties - 1 (Kid Know Nothing)<br>\nHezLucky - 1 (Vifam)<br>\nbobsnox - 1 (avasthearties)<br>\n<br>\nNot Voting - tarsonisocelot, LobsterCatapult</div></blockquote><br>\nThe people voting Vifam were... Rainbowdash, confirmed town. ConfidAnon, probably town. YankCane151, likely town. HezLucky, likely town. Horrifying Hero, likely town. Wickedestjr, confirmed town (from my perspective). That leaves el simo. So I believe either this bandwagon was all town or el simo is scum. <br>\n<br>\nIn conclusion, I believe there's a pretty strong connection between el simo and Vifam. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: normal; display: inline\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Vifam/Yonzy + LobsterCatapult</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\nFirstly, LobsterCatapult's comments regarding Yonzy. Originally, her response to Yonzy's late/unneccessary random vote was <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3254595#p3254595\" class=\"postlink\">'lol Yonzy'</a>. Combined with the reasoning for her 'lol Yonzy' comment which she gives <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3258300#p3258300\" class=\"postlink\">later</a>, I get the impression that LobsterCatapult isn't Yonzy/Vifam's scumbuddy. When she does give her reasoning for the 'lol Yonzy' comment, she never does explicitly express suspicion of Yonzy- it is IIoA. IIRC, aside from myself, nobody else commented or acknowledged Yonzy's weird post prior to LobsterCatapult's acknowledgement. So LobsterCatapult didn't comment on it because she felt obligated to so the only other reason for her commenting on it was to distance herself from Yonzy. But she did a poor job of that if that was the motive. She never even expresses suspicion of Yonzy. <br>\n<br>\nNext, Friend's wall post. His stance on Vifam is really weird, but I'm unable to determine the scum motive for taking such a strange stance. I'll be more specific. My main issue with Friend's wall post is that his reads don't match up with the pool of players he wouldn't mind getting lynched:<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Friend wrote:</cite>Out of that group (Yonzy, avast, bobs, el simo, Rainbow), my list looks something like this from towniest to scummiest:<br>\n<br>\nBobs<br>\nel simo<br>\nYonzy (Vifam)<br>\nRainbow<br>\nAvast<br>\n<br>\nThey're all pretty scummy, TBH. None of those are town reads. Wouldn't be surprised if there were 2.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Friend wrote:</cite>TLDR:For all you lazy fucks that don't like reading, here's a pool of people that I wouldn't mind seeing get some rope: <br>\n<br>\nWICKED<br>\nYANK<br>\nSIMO<br>\nBOBS<br>\nAVAST<br>\nTARSON<br>\n<br>\nThat's not in any particular order, but I consider everyone not on that list prob-town for the time being.</div></blockquote><br>\nNote that, in the first quote, Friend says that Vifam is pretty scummy, but in the second list Friend doesn't put Vifam in his lynch pool and says that Vifam is prob-town. That's really weird. The only reasons I don't find it too suspicious are because I don't see a scum motive and Friend's stance on Rainbowdash is just as weird (and Rainbowdash was town). <br>\n   <br>\nFinally, LobsterCatapult's comments regarding Vifam in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3290154#p3290154\" class=\"postlink\">post 403</a> and <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3302752#p3302752\" class=\"postlink\">post 535</a>. Her comment in post 535 is a bit weird, but I have trouble imagining post 403 coming from Vifam's scumbuddy. <br>\n <br>\nIn conclusion, there are a few reasons to believe LobsterCatapult is connected to Vifam and it's not a terrible lynch, but I'm leaning town. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: normal; display: inline\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Vifam/Yonzy + tarsonisocelot:</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\nAfter reading tarsonisocelot in isolation, I am <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">extremely</div> bothered by the lack of attention she has gotten recently. She mentioned the Vifam/Yonzy once throughout the course of day 1. Her one mention of Vifam/Yonzy was <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3268642#p3268642\" class=\"postlink\">here</a> where she mentions a very small suspicion of Yonzy. However, this suspicion was only given when asked for it by ConfidAnon. Aside from that, she completely ignored Yonzy/Vifam for the rest of the game. She completely ignored the Vifam bandwagon at the end of day 1 and never even expressed interest in joining it.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: normal; display: inline\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Summary:</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\nThere's a small connection between LobsterCatapult and the dead scum and a slightly stronger connection between avasthearties and the dead scum, but there is a strong connection between el simo and the dead scum and a very strong connection between tarsonisocelot and the dead scum. I wouldn't mind any of these four players getting lynched, but I would prefer to see an el simo lynch or a tarsonisocelot lynch. There's also a strong connection between el simo and tarsonisocelot (so my suspicion isn't just based on this post) which I'll get to later. Also, I have some other points against these two players which I noticed when doing my analysis.

If that was the case, why wasn't she able to seriously vote anybody later in the game until we got more information to work with? It's because her vote for el simo was an early distancing vote.

I see the game as a massive probability tree that branches at every role and every outcome possible. As scum then I begin with several of the most important branches already set. The aim is always to end up in the set of branches where the win condition is set, and it's easier to work out which set that is when you know the more of the set-up. Both are challenging but I currently prefer scum more because I enjoy trying to convince others to head down the paths that lead to my win condition over trying to work out which paths those are.<br>\n2. With magnets. And by trying to keep track of inconsistencies.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nThis is post 41. The serious vote she made against me came on page 2 and with not additional information, just a vote and some answers to the RQs. Right.. super cereal!<br>\n<br>\nAsked to explain it, Wicked says that it was because my supposed AtE bothered her more than anyone else at the time, and that this is inconsistent with her post later on page 6 where she says she needs more information before expressing her suspicion, therefore it must be a scum distancing vote.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>tarsonisocelot wrote:</cite>I didn't have any strong feelings about any player at the time, and the \"I've been town every other game on this account\" thing bothered me more than anything else that had happened at that point. As post 35 had already explained why one might dislike that post, and I was at the time pretty much apathetic about everything I didn't state my reasons. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">It's not a post I would lynch for, but it is one I would vote for to see if the reaction was worth lynching for.</div> My lack of commitment at the time pretty much stopped me from actually doing anything useful though.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nThis is her explanation of her vote on me. The bolded part is relevant. She says it is something she would vote for to see if the reactions meritted my lynching.<br>\n<br>\nThis was a pressure vote, she was fishing for reactions as she clearly explained. This is exactly what she said she needed to do before forming any suspicions, she was looking for more information on me! How is this inconsistent with her claims on page 6?<br>\n<br>\nIn his first point on our connection Wicked has over stated his evidence, claiming serious votes during RVS and relevantly leaves out important information, such as the fact that her vote on me was fishing as that would ruin his case on me.<br>\n<br>\n<div align=\"center\"><hr style=\"height:14px;width:99%\"></div><br>\nHis second point against me is that tar never explained her null read on me when she was asked for her thoughts on four players.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Wickedestjr wrote:</cite>[Secondly, in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3280090#p3280090\" class=\"postlink\">post 322</a> tarsonisocelot gives her reads on four of the players because she was asked to (IIRC). el simo is one of the players tarsonisocelot gave her read of. My issue with this post is that, unlike the other three reads, tarsonisocelot doesn't justify her el simo nullread- it's IIoA. This reeks of scum reluctant to give a read on their scumbuddy.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nHere are his exact words and here are tars exact words on me:<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>tarsonisocelot wrote:</cite>el simo - null, <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">most of the activity was around the start of the game</div> when they were targetted for saying they'd been town every other game on this account, <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">lurky since they stopped being attacked, little scumhunting.</div></div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nDoes this not explain why she has a null read on me? Is this not enough justification for you? She's clearly stated that I was lurking, but had done some little scum hunting. She did explain her null read.<br>\n<br>\n<div align=\"center\"><hr style=\"height:14px;width:99%\"></div><br>\nHis third point is that Tar votes me three times with out explaining it or pushing it further.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Wickedestjr wrote:</cite>Thirdly, you'll notice that throughout the course of the game, tarsonisocelot has voted el simo three times. She voted him in her <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3252653#p3252653\" class=\"postlink\">post 41</a> but never did explain the vote or express suspicion of el simo, despite stating her vote was serious <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3365891#p3365891\" class=\"postlink\">later</a>. There was also no followup to the vote and she never asked el simo any questions (which is odd considering she had her vote on him) until <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3278827#p3278827\" class=\"postlink\">this post</a> where she finally switched her vote. She votes el simo again in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3299238#p3299238\" class=\"postlink\">post 496</a> but removes the vote immediately after el simo responds <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3301652#p3301652\" class=\"postlink\">here</a> and states that she didn't really even remember her reasoning. tarsonisocelot votes el simo a third time in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3338302#p3338302\" class=\"postlink\">post 644</a> but this vote doesn't come until after LobsterCatapult expresses suspicion of him and votes him first. tarsonisocelot uses bandwagoning as a point to justify this vote but never mentioned the point earlier. What's worse is that tarsonisocelot does nothing with this vote. el simo asks her about the case before defending and tarsonisocelot never elaborates which shows that she doesn't actually care about el simo defending himself. She switched her vote before even seeing a defense from him. I strongly get the impression that tarsonisocelot is desperately trying to distance herself from her scumbuddy.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nFirstly, as we have established, Wickeds definition of a serious vote is pretty loose. Her serious vote against me in post 41 was a reaction vote like she explained later. So this vote is null for his argument.<br>\n<br>\nThe second vote against me was an entire misunderstanding.<br>\n<br>\nThe third vote, she expressed legitimate suspicion and removed it once Ethos gave her an explanation of their meta read on me.<br>\n<br>\nAnd this implies desperately distancing to you? She desperately is trying to distance herself from me with an unexplained reaction vote on page 2, a misunderstanding and a legitimate vote?<br>\n<br>\n<div align=\"center\"><hr style=\"height:14px;width:99%\"></div><br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Wickedestjr wrote:</cite>Fourthly, one of the more important points, IIRC, el simo has completely ignored tarsonisocelot throughout the whole game and only interacted with her when defending himself from her votes.

Tommie jumped in with four \"I'm going to make a post next post\" posts. Krazy's done nothing to change that. If I didn't specifically ISO Krazy and his replaced predecessors, I doubt I would have even noticed his presence in this game, and he would continue to go unnoticed. His slot is likely lurker/active-lurker scum trying to stay under the radar. Slight lack of content is a null-tell, but this is beyond a simple nulltell-ridden wildcard.<br>\n<br>\nBefore going further, I'd like to say a couple things. I am stating very clearly: <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">I believe HH is the remaining scum</div>. I'm also re-re-re-reading their ISO as I write this next section, so feel free to read along. I will refer to them as \"he\" and \"him\" because it's much simpler that way.<br>\n<br>\nHH's fake miller claim gave little in the way of information and confused the town. Even worse, after his rather enlightening (not) explanation, he defended Hez whilst attacking Yonzy. In his super-wall post as well as many of his regular posts, he has done the same (<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3302371#p3302371\" class=\"postlink\">and after the Yonzy lynch,  Hez and HH become rainbow powered best friends</a>). It's very evident that he's pushing for a polarity there (as in, Yonzy is obvscum and Hez is obvtown). Knowing both of their alignments enlightens us as to how scummy that is.<br>\n<br>\nHH's reads are ridiculously backwards, calling Hez town, but consistently reading town PRs as scum (until today, of course, when he casually announces a win while bandwagoning a townie). He tunneled Wicked for over a month and a half just to drop it within a day, when tunneling PRs fails to suit his purposes. Also, rapid vote switch to me when the Krazy wagon gets no support (which, by the way, was <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">never</div> supported by HH before his vote, which had no explanation whatsoever).
