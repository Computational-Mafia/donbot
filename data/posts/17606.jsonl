Votes and unvotes must be in bold in order to be counted. Unvoting before casting a new vote is not necessary, but a good habit nonetheless. (e.g. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Unvote, vote Bunnylover</div>)<br>\n2. Lynches always require a majority of votes (I.E. This means 4 votes are required for a lynch when 6 people are still alive). After a lynch has been reached, votes or unvotes are no longer counted.<br>\n3. You may vote No Lynch. (e.g. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote No Lynch</div>) If a majority votes No Lynch, the day will end without a lynch.<br>\n4. If days take too long, the mod may impose a deadline. If no majority of votes has been reached by the deadline, whoever has most votes at that time will be lynched. In case of a tie or in case No Lynch has most votes, the day will end without a lynch.<br>\n5. After your death scene has been posted, you may no longer post. If you can't resist the urge, you may post exactly one very short post saying nothing more than \"bah\".<br>\n6. You're not allowed to quote personal messages from me. Communication with the mod is not to be used as part of the gameplay. Pretending to quote the mod is punishable too.<br>\n7. You're not allowed to edit your posts, unless that post is the last post in the topic. I will be comparing the time the post was last edited and the time the next post was made to check if this rule is being honoured.<br>\n8. Do not use fonts smaller than normal or in hard-to-read colours. Also, do not hide messages in the post subject or links in your post.<br>\n9. It's forbidden to discuss the game outside of the thread, unless specifically stated by your role.<br>\n10. If a situation arises where these rules are ambiguous or incomplete in any way, what the mod says will go. If you have any questions or comments, please PM the mod rather than posting it in the game thread.<br>\n11. Every 48 hours, I will be sending out a prod check if you haven't posted.", "time": "Wed May 25, 2011 5:11 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=17606&start=0", "forum": "53", "thread": "17606"}

It also shows that you're not reading the thread very well if you can confuse two players who play nothing alike, have usernames that aren't remotely similar, and don't even have avatars that look anything alike.<br>\nI almost want to say that Imat realized chkflip was his partner and was reluctant to bus this early in the game, so he switched.

Of course a vig SHOULDN'T claim in response to this post, but there's a chance someone is stupid or unattentive and still does it (or more likely, makes a comment that can help the scum guess their role).

If you notice in my original post, I never said arrogance was a scumtell. I voted to spark discussion. You are clearly a competent player, but the tunnel vision I dislike with a passion. To be honest, I voted on an extremely tentative grasp of straws. But Tunnel Vision isn't productive. I'll keep my vote where it is now. Waiting for people to either back me up or shoot me down...People who aren't Parama.</div></blockquote><br>\nSo you're going to rely on others to try and point out any legitimate reasoning while you keep your vote and say \"yeah bro i agree lololol\" so that you don't hold any responsibility in the scenario of a lynch?<br>\n...sure.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Imat wrote:</cite>But wait...You say you have nothing on me...Then Slaxx comes along and agrees with your suspicions, suddenly you're going to \"break me?\" Then Slaxx comes and votes...Could be he's simply following your argument, but I'm not so sure.

It reads like stream-of-consciousness-style writing, but at the same time his posts feel strangely forced a lot of the time, as if he constantly needs to remind himself of things (like \"try not to say anything scummy\"). There's also a lot of \"The correct way to play this game is like this, not like that\", but then he isn't always very consistent (saying that the second vote is the most important one, and then trying to downplay the importance of his own second vote for Parama). From a psychological point of view though, I don't expect scum would allow themselves to post in that particular style, as they'd intuitively feel it's easy to screw up.<br>\n<br>\n---   ---   ---   ---   ---<br>\n<br>\nI don't like Peabody's last two posts. He puts the fourth vote on Imat, adding that he's also suspicious of chkflip, but he thinks an Imat vote is \"more beneficial\". Then suddenly when petroleumjelly makes it five votes, he's worried that the bandwagon is growing too fast, and he realizes that chkflip is voting Imat, and that if one of them is scum, chkflip is more likely. What happened in the six hours between those two posts? Why are you worried about the speed of a bandwagon that you just helped creating yourself?

The little content there is is extremely non-committal, with the exception of the fake attack he is making on Peabody. Where Parama is shooting nuclear weapons, Bezu is merely faintly slapping Peabody around. That whole post a few days ago on Imat is simply useless. Its not a read, its narration. Its the same thing he did for Peabody.<br>\n<br>\nThat reads to me like a scum waiting for something to latch on too.

You're wrong about me being scum, but you're right that I have been less active and less helpful than I could have been. I think this has to do with the play style of a number of players in this game: very aggressive (also in their language), jumping around a lot, trying to generate reactions. I'm talking about Parama, MarchHare, Slaxx, you. I find it very hard to get an idea of the alignment of this type of player.<br>\n<br>\nThe way I look for scum (at least on Day 1) is completely different: I try to read posts that reveal someone's thought process and analyze if their thought process is more likely to be that of a townie or that of scum (psychologically speaking). See my post about Imat that you didn't like. It's not \"narration\", it's analysis. See also my questioning of Peabody (which I probably went about the wrong way; my questions didn't give him much chance to screw up the answers). It's just that there's been a distinct lack of posts that reveal much thought process in this game, so it's been hard for me to find something concrete.<br>\n<br>\nI can't help but notice that Peabody just now did something very similar to the earlier Imat/chkflip switch: voting petroleumjelly and then changing his mind to Marble shortly thereafter. Only now nobody posted in between, so it feels to me even more as being hasty. Being hasty is more of a town tell than a scumtell, IMO.<br>\n<br>\nI'm going to do a close reread and ISO some people and see if I can get some clearer reads about everyone.

The other 2 simply state that Petrol \"Still thinks Marble needs to die,\" more or less. I've stated before that this kind of campaigning is not a good thing, especially on Day 1, because the time between confirming your suspicions by voting and somebody actually getting lynched could be spent doing something useful for the Town, such as more Scumhunting.

Just to let you know, this is not my first game, but I've played a couple games on another site, so I know my way around. <br>\n<br>\nThis post not be as detailed as I would have liked it, since I accidentally refreshed the page and lost a few paragraphs.<br>\n<br>\nI've noticed a lot of people seem to be suspecting bez, but I didn't find anything scummy about him in particular. Going through several days' worth of posts in a few hours makes me forget things. Anyone care to elaborate on their vote for me? <br>\n<br>\nI'm suspicious of PJ. I think Imat is town. These opinions are viable to change, and are mostly based on vibes.<br>\n<br>\nI'd like to note that I'm kind of bummed because I was hoping for some more drama between Parama and IS after reading the first page or so worth of posts. I'd also like to say that I'm suspicious of IS because he was making such a big deal about RVS at the beginning and the amount of posts he made as the game went on has lowered quite a bit. Other than that, he hasn't done much else to make me think he is scum.<br>\n<br>\nI'm wary of IS and Parama. They seem to be really experienced, and IS doesn't seem to be as tough as brick wall as I thought. Slightly suspicious of IS, and Parama seems to be leaning to town.<br>\n<br>\nMaybe he's just ditched the game or is lurking, but I'd like to see some posting from E_Lou_Sive. He hasn't exactly posted anything helpful to the town, and I don't have anything to use to read him with, so I'm assuming he's scum. Anyone not posting like him, or just making fluff posts either doesn't give a damn or is scum, and mafia games with those types of people aren't fun for anyone. Hopefully whoever is soon to replace him will prove me wrong.<br>\n<br>\nI find it suspicious how Peabody was making such a big deal about having a second vote on the third post during RVS. I've been in games where someone was at 4 votes before the second page and that game went alright. I'm most suspicious of Peabody, as he changed his vote to the easy newbie prey. And he seems to be ordering the vig around to kill off players he doesn't like.

This is play I would expect from newbies.<br>\n<br>\nMarble101: Right now, the correct strategy is to investigate whoever you want.  To quickly explain, consider the alternative.  Assuming you are Town, if you announce your plans, it allows for scum to create their most optimal counter-attack.  This most often includes (i) deciding if your investigation is not a threat and thus not doing anything about, and thus using any scum powers for more efficient ends, or (ii) killing your investigation target from under you as Internet Stranger has alluded, or (iii) role-blocking you.  And in theme games &#8211; which this game is not &#8211; there may also be other ways to screw with investigations.<br>\n<br>\nScum should, on the whole, have to <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">worry</div> about claimed Cops.  By telling the world who you choose to investigate, the scum have to worry a good deal less because it effectively tells them what they need to do to work around it.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">4.)</div> Ah.

I'm pretty sure he's just been lynched, so we'll find out the outcome soon. In the meantime I'll go back over bezu. I suspected him earlier, much earlier, but perhaps his disappearance and my reads on first PJ, then Marble as a Scummate, dropped him back under the radar for me. <br>\n<br>\nSomething a bit off for me: It would appear we have a group of 2 to 4 people leading the Town around.

Internet Stranger-difficult leaning town: He's actively scumhunting...something I can say about less than half of the players in this game. I'd like to see every townie doing that. There should be more town-aligned, than mafia or third party-aligned. <br>\n<br>\nHonestly though, can you please show me the exact posts that showed I was scum? (Since I'm *still* confused.)<br>\n<br>\n2. Parama-helpful, leaning town to town: I don't like you as a player, but you're scumhunting. You can be persuasive and you write good cases. <br>\n<br>\n3. Marble101-VI, *SCUM* Well, you scum slipped. If you actually had some good posts, I would be willing to give you the benefit of doubt, and say that you worded what you said wrong. Anyways, you show no sign of being town, you're either really stupid, in elementary school, or trying to act noobish, because you don't know how to be scum. <br>\n<br>\nBy the way, I don't think I'll ever be regretting my vote on you, since you're detrimental to the town, whether you're scum or not. <br>\n<br>\n4. jilynne1991-town. duh: Well, let's see. My post said I'm town-aligned, so I must be, unles the mod screwed up, which I doubt.<br>\n<br>\n5. Peabody-leaning town-null: You're posts seem town, but I do need to see some more, before I decide. <br>\n<br>\n6. E_Lou_Sive-what? post more. null-I need more posts from you. You seem to be rewording what other people say. Not sure yet.<br>\n<br>\n7. LittleGrey-who? post more. null: Sorry, I need more posts from you too. You slipped my mind when I was making this post, so that's a problem. <br>\n<br>\n8. Slaxx-leaning town: You seem to be trying. I do need to see some scumhunting from you, but at least you're trying.<br>\n<br>\n9. MarchHare-lol, ur sarcasm is interesting, leaning town: You amuse me. You seem to be trying to help, but you seem to be using a gut feeling as a read, and then making up cases, and I don't think that's how you're supposed to do it.<br>\n<br>\n10. Imat-possibly scum, null (a.k.a ur confusing me)-Well, you seem to be attempting to help, but what you write is confusing me. It's like, if I decide you're scum, I can see why, but if I decide you're town, I can see why you'd be town too. So you're still kind of a null for me. <br>\n<br>\n11. petroleumjelly-seems to be scum: You're posts are scummy, but you haven't scum slipped or majorly screwed up yet, so I'm still not sure about you.<br>\n<br>\n12. CryMeARiver-chkflip seemed to be leaning town, so leaning town- You have pretty good judgement, but I need to see you scumhunting a bit more.<br>\n<br>\nTell me when I need to claim.

There's also a lot of \"The correct way to play this game is like this, not like that\", but then he isn't always very consistent (saying that the second vote is the most important one, and then trying to downplay the importance of his own second vote for Parama).

Here's why:<br>\n<br>\n1) A strange but very plausible thought popped into my head earlier: Elusive was mafia roleblocker. Marble claimed cop night 1, yet got a report. Marble should have been blocked. Now, as I said, Elusive could have just been afk as he often does, but I looked back and Parama was very sure Elusive was scum, making me think he was there for deciding the kill, and probably there for the roleblock. I think it is a possibility that the reason there were only two kills night 1 is Elusive, thinking Marble was cop, roleblocked him, but he was actually SK and missed his kill. This isn't a particularly strong thought, but its what I have right now. There are many ways we can support or disprove this idea with a mass claim. If we have a lot of PRs (not going to go into specifics for obvious reasons) we might have to consider the possibility Marble is indeed fake. If there is only 2 weak PRs or 1 strong PR left hiding in the bushes, then Marble is probably legit and either SK happened to target mafia's kill or got blocked.<br>\n2) It narrows down the suspect pool with clears from reports. If there is a Jailkeeper, Roleblocker, or Tracker, they need to claim TODAY if they have at least on alive clear. This forces the SK to narrow down who he kills. It also narrows down our suspect pool. I think if Marble is legit the SK will be investigation immune, so one of the three PRs above would be really helpful.<br>\n3) The actual PR claims get narrowed down. If SK claims PR, he is forced to continue outting reports and explaining why he is still alive.<br>\n<br>\ntldr; I am for the mass claim, but I will wait on more people first.", "time": "Thu Jun 23, 2011 8:41 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=17606&start=725", "forum": "53", "thread": "17606"}

{"number": 832, "id": "3177960", "user": "Imat", "user_id": "8734", "content": "That seems like an obvious answer...Everybody is Trying to act Pro-Town. The only way we can get confident in a lynch is slips in this behavior. Mafia are more likely to slip than SKs because they know too much. They knew, in this game, at least 2 other players, and that changed how they behaved towards those players. Our job, as Town, is to weed out these slips through pressure and \"deductive reasoning\" before we are outnumbered. If somebody is literally trying to act Anti-Town, they would be in a whole heap of trouble.<br>\n<br>\nPeabody, this would probably be a good time to claim. And to pipe up. Which is probably hypocritical coming from me at this stage of the game. I really haven't been able to keep my head in this.<br>\n<br>\nBeck brings up some interesting points. Hey Beck, your thoughts on Peabody vs IS? You can wait until after the claim, if it comes, but I'd like to know where you're sitting at for those two. For instance, if Peabody/IS is lynched today (Looking more like the former, but things can change quickly in this game) and flips Town, will you try to get the other lynched the following day? Or would this change your opinions of some players enough to push a different lynch?<br>\n<br>\nIS, you say you're playing the \"cull the herd\" game. Who is next on your \"herd\" list if peabody is lynched today and flips Town? Also, do you think it is entirely appropriate to play said game yet? It is difficult to catch a good SK in a slip, because they only know a little bit more than the rest of us, but could it be that the SK has already slipped, and a careful read could generate some clues?<br>\n<br>\nHere's where I stand: Peabody is currently the Scummiest to me. I'm not sold on him, but the next in line is Cookie. I'm wary of his claim. It would be so easy, as the SK, to mime a Cop by simply handing out Innocent results. Then again, he did investigate some of the top suspects. Giving innocents would be risky on those. Which actually changes my opinion mid-typing. After Peabody would be IS, then Beck.<br>\n<br>\nIS's reactions are way too over-the-top. There is really no call to lash out because a single person voices concerns over your gameplay. And lash out he has.<br>\n<br>\nAs for Beck: He comes in here and immediately accuses somebody. Not Scummy. However, he makes it a point to say that both himself and Petro are Confirmed Town. This could have been a simple case of not knowing about Cop-immune SKs, yet it could also have been trying to keep himself out of suspicions. The weakest of my suspicions, yet I'm going to keep him in mind as the Day continues.", "time": "Thu Jun 30, 2011 10:36 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=17606&start=825", "forum": "53", "thread": "17606"}

I didn't mention your name either, so why did you think it was directed at you?<br>\n<br>\nThe only lynch I'm ok with is Peabody today. I think he is Scum. Yet I won't stop hunting just because I may have found Scum. That would be silly. Clearly you lot are doing the same thing. <br>\n<br>\nSo here's the real problem: If, on any other day, somebody had asked somebody who they would prefer to lynch and how they would react to that player's role, it would have been fine. People are wondering where other players are at, some want confirmation of their own suspicions, others want to know if they missed something. Now it is anathema. I would point out that nothing has changed. If the SK would ask those questions today, they would be asking the same questions, for the same reasons, yesterday. And yet Day 1 and Day 2, which saw this behavior, aren't being scrutinized. Wouldn't it actually be more beneficial to check out the previous days, when the SK knew he/she was safe from scrutiny? They could easily target those most Town-like, seeing as how we've all been making nice, detailed lists for them, which wouldn't really narrow down our suspect pool in the slightest. But to ask those same questions now is simply asking for scrutiny. The SK wants to lie low, stay off radars as long as possible. I ask you, does that post look like something you would post in an attempt to \"lay low?\" It doesn't to me.<br>\n<br>\nHere's how I see it, and I'll answer my own questions to some extent in the process: Peabody is the most likely suspect. Based on his overall behavior, he has been most Scummy. So I'll vote to lynch Peabody today. If he flips Town, always a possibility, I'll be looking at IS tomorrow. The SK, of all of us, is the only one who doesn't care who, besides himself, gets lynched. He/she is also the only one who cares, to any huge extent, whether or not he/she gets lynched. IS's planned strategy is to \"cull the herd,\" a plan which invariably has a \"Don't care who gets lynched\" attitude behind it. IS also overreacts to every attack on his person. I think he'll be the good backup lynch if Peabody flips Town. After IS, I don't really have a plan. This is what my reading has come to so far. If you want to lynch me to get me out of the way as a suspect, fine.

Making cases up as you go along is putting on blinders to the truth.  It's called tunneling.  A person can say anything and then make a case to prove it.  For example, I can just say a banana is like a lawyer and then make up crap to support my case.  If this is the way you choose to condemn me, admit it and forget it.<br>\n<br>\nOk, now onto the Imat iso. <br>\n<br>\nIs this what you were referring to, Beck, by this 'no matter my alignment' talk?  <blockquote><div><cite>Imat 74 wrote:</cite><br>\nFinally...You can't \"break\" Town, so you aren't gonna get anywhere with me. If you truly are this fantastic player, which has some merit I'll admit, why not focus on getting the actual Scum?

If me repeating that I want discussion is \"useless and counterproductive,\" how is repeating that you want somebody lynched any better? Time and again you've voted for an already suspected player, but Marble was different. It didn't take an expert to see that Marble could be scum questioning the existence of a second scum, and I've gone back and forth on Marble's alignment every time I try to post, yet you pointed it out as your entire argument and left it at that. This was such an obvious thing, you thought you had a lynch in the bag. Didn't even have to read any of his posts beyond the one to form your evidence. I believe it was chkflip who accused me of Scum Skimming, and I think that is exactly what happened here. You spotted an easy BW and ran with it.</div></blockquote><br>\nThis case one PJ looks legit, and from that point forward, I considered Imat a town read until recently.  The fact that he said he was wavering between reads on Marble helped me out because there was a lot of confusion on Marble at that time.  <br>\n<br>\nHowever, I also see A LOT of theory talk which I've seen in scum before (talk about second votes, how 'discussion' helps, whether Marble was noobtown/noobscum/or even pro scum, etc).<br>\n<br>\nLining up lynches for the next couple days caught my attention today, and the 'regardless of my alignment' talk/theory talk is icing on my case.

Even though the whole \"Good Luck!\" post makes me grimace, I think he is Town.  Although multiple players say Peabody is not really coming up with his own cases (or something to that effect, I don't claim I really understand the \"case\" on him), when I read his posts it looks to me like he has constantly revised his opinions and seems to be genuinely hunting for scum.  Though I understand a SK could just as well do the same thing (and I also think Slaxx has done a convincing job of adjusting his reads throughout the game), it has simply felt very genuine.  And more often than not, it feels like when Peabody starts to second-guess a wagon, it is usually somewhat against-the-grain, and just as importantly, he seems to pretty accurate when he's done it.  Additionally, Peabody's start to today pretty much mirrored my thoughts exactly: overnight, I had given the game a quick read, and decided that LittleGrey would probably get my vote if I survived the night.  So I was a bit surprised that LittleGrey was killed at all, and from what I can tell, so was Peabody.  Still, the biggest niggling doubt for me is that LittleGrey did express moderate suspicion of Peabody, but it's not enough to push me into thinking Peabody is scum here.<br>\n<br>\nI also think Marble101 is Town, barring something interesting from a mass-claim.  I suspect Beck is probably Town -- and at the very least he is mostly my pool today because of the investigation result on him, <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">just</div> in case Marble101 still gives is significant results.<br>\n<br>\nSo I am pretty much left with a pool of three players: {Imat, Slaxx, Internet Stranger}.  Of the three, I still prefer an Imat lynch.  Internet Stranger is next, and Slaxx would be last.<br>\n<br>\nI would still like a mass-claim.  If we can narrow down our lynches to three players right now, we will win the game because we have three lynches left.  If y'all decide not to lynch Peabody, I still strongly suggest that when Imat is replaced, we pressure his replacement into claiming <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">immediately</div> and before reading the game.

Basically, his first post of substance that day (and really, perhaps his first substantive post of the game &#8211; which notably only came after we were clearly forced into hunting for a Serial Killer) was essentially to list out every single player in the game besides himself and promptly cast doubt on them, with the exception of MarchHare because Marble101 had just claimed his innocent result on MarchHare:<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Internet Stranger, Post 728 wrote:</cite>Any particular reason why the scum isnt killing Marble? <br>\nAny particular reason the scum didnt shoot PJ?<br>\n<br>\nIf Marble was scum, he would have to kill a confirmed innocent every night from here on out to get into lylo wifom time. Otherwise, he paints himself into a corner and loses since we would run out of cleared suspects and it would come back to him.<br>\nLike this:<br>\nDay 3: 7 alive, 2 confirmed, 4 unconfirmed, 1 cop(?)<br>\nDay 4: 5 alive, 2 confirmed, 2 unconfirmed, 1 cop(?)<br>\nDay 5: 3 alive, 1 confirmed, 1 unconfirmed, 1 cop(?)<br>\n<br>\nIf what Marble says is true, then the only suspects are Slaxx, Imat, Peabody, IS. <br>\n<br>\nSlaxx has been trying to act like a White Knight all game, that deserves death just in itself.<br>\nPeabody has been coasting most of the game, thats a definite scum trait.<br>\nImat hasnt really contributed all that much, another case for being the last scum.<br>\n<br>\nFor now:<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Unvote: Marchhare</div></div></blockquote><br>\nEssentially, Internet Stranger had just had another prospective Town temporarily taken out of his pool of potential mislynches.  And given how on Day Three the Serial Killer needed three mislynches to win, it cuts against him that Internet Stranger's first order of business was to make everybody look suspicious, rather than trying to decide if somebody is Town.<br>\n<br>\nAnd then, Internet Stranger promptly suggested that the Serial Killer intentionally did not kill on Night One:<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Internet Stranger, Post 731 wrote:</cite>So the serial killer is just laying in the bushes avoiding kills until now just for the explicit purpose of impersonating scum later?</div></blockquote><br>\nWhich, as I quickly pointed out in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3152118#p3152118\" class=\"postlink\">Post 734</a>, is a rather absurd jump to make given the multitude of things that could explain a missing kill.  Given Internet Stranger&#8217;s experience, I am more than comfortable in saying he knows better than to jump to the most unlikely conclusion over explanations which are far more probable.  This post in particular feels like a contrived attempt to show ignorance about the goings-on of the Serial Killer.", "time": "Tue Jul 12, 2011 12:03 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=17606&start=1025", "forum": "53", "thread": "17606"}
