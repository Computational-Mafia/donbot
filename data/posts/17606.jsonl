Votes and unvotes must be in bold in order to be counted. Unvoting before casting a new vote is not necessary, but a good habit nonetheless. (e.g. <span class=\"noboldsig\">Unvote, vote Bunnylover</span>)<br>2. Lynches always require a majority of votes (I.E. This means 4 votes are required for a lynch when 6 people are still alive). After a lynch has been reached, votes or unvotes are no longer counted.<br>3. You may vote No Lynch. (e.g. <span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote No Lynch</span>) If a majority votes No Lynch, the day will end without a lynch.<br>4. If days take too long, the mod may impose a deadline. If no majority of votes has been reached by the deadline, whoever has most votes at that time will be lynched. In case of a tie or in case No Lynch has most votes, the day will end without a lynch.<br>5. After your death scene has been posted, you may no longer post. If you can't resist the urge, you may post exactly one very short post saying nothing more than \"bah\".<br>6. You're not allowed to quote personal messages from me. Communication with the mod is not to be used as part of the gameplay. Pretending to quote the mod is punishable too.<br>7. You're not allowed to edit your posts, unless that post is the last post in the topic. I will be comparing the time the post was last edited and the time the next post was made to check if this rule is being honoured.<br>8. Do not use fonts smaller than normal or in hard-to-read colours. Also, do not hide messages in the post subject or links in your post.<br>9. It's forbidden to discuss the game outside of the thread, unless specifically stated by your role.<br>10. If a situation arises where these rules are ambiguous or incomplete in any way, what the mod says will go. If you have any questions or comments, please PM the mod rather than posting it in the game thread.<br>11. Every 48 hours, I will be sending out a prod check if you haven't posted."}

Then I'll say that you're right, you're formulating your own opinions and following through on them. Heck, give a good reasoning for voting me and I'll put you back on neutral ground. Not having good leads is one thing. Following someone else's lead while they vote, with little to no contributing reads, is a good sign of a guy who wants somebody lynched, no matter the cost. At least Parama has considered the cost. You want me ded. You are actively campaigning for my death. First day campaign for the death of any player, unless they claim Scum, is bad. Parama can keep his vote on me all he wants, long as he tries to find the real Scum while he's at it. You have no interest in the latter, so it seems, only in finding more votes for the bandwagon. How is there anything Pro-Town about that?"}

What happened in the six hours between those two posts? Why are you worried about the speed of a bandwagon that you just helped creating yourself? And is there a particular reason to assume one of Imat and chkflip is scum?</div></blockquote><br><br>1) I was worried about the speed of the bandwagon because for a bandwagon to form that quickly, it is probable that one or two scum are on the wagon.  I understand that this isn't always the case, but the fact that I realized chkflip was on the bandwagon causes me to believe that <span style=\"font-style: italic\">is</span> what is happening.<br>2) I guess its not set in stone that one of the two are scum, but there is some definite crossfire between the two.  I'm more voting chkflip because I think he's scum, and not really because I think one of the two are scum.<br><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Slaxx wrote:</cite>0-1 scum is in<br><br>(Peabody, Petroleum)<br><br>They arent buddies because of Petro's opening post.

Maybe I'm town, concerned about another possible town lynch?  Besides, I actually expected a lot more flak for jumping off that bandwagon.  In a previous game, I actually jumped on and off a bandwagon as town and got a lot of attention for it.  A bandwagon formed on me immediately.  Needless to say, if I were PeabodyScum, I would probably have just rolled with that bandwagon (Yeah yeah, WIFOM...).<br><br>I'm unsure what to think about Marbles calling out a possible two faction setup.

You're wrong about me being scum, but you're right that I have been less active and less helpful than I could have been. I think this has to do with the play style of a number of players in this game: very aggressive (also in their language), jumping around a lot, trying to generate reactions. I'm talking about Parama, MarchHare, Slaxx, you. I find it very hard to get an idea of the alignment of this type of player.<br><br>The way I look for scum (at least on Day 1) is completely different: I try to read posts that reveal someone's thought process and analyze if their thought process is more likely to be that of a townie or that of scum (psychologically speaking). See my post about Imat that you didn't like. It's not \"narration\", it's analysis. See also my questioning of Peabody (which I probably went about the wrong way; my questions didn't give him much chance to screw up the answers). It's just that there's been a distinct lack of posts that reveal much thought process in this game, so it's been hard for me to find something concrete.<br><br>I can't help but notice that Peabody just now did something very similar to the earlier Imat/chkflip switch: voting petroleumjelly and then changing his mind to Marble shortly thereafter. Only now nobody posted in between, so it feels to me even more as being hasty. Being hasty is more of a town tell than a scumtell, IMO.<br><br>I'm going to do a close reread and ISO some people and see if I can get some clearer reads about everyone.

But in more recent posts, #223 and #234, Petrol states that Marble needs to be lynched. Same message in 3 posts, and only 186 has reasoning. The other 2 simply state that Petrol \"Still thinks Marble needs to die,\" more or less. I've stated before that this kind of campaigning is not a good thing, especially on Day 1, because the time between confirming your suspicions by voting and somebody actually getting lynched could be spent doing something useful for the Town, such as more Scumhunting. Petrol's constant pleas for votes on Marble don't strike me as coming from a guy who is actively Scumhunting, but rather from somebody who wants a BW to form as fast as possible and won't stop pushing until the target gets the rope. <br><br>This also goes against his own logic. If me repeating that I want discussion is \"useless and counterproductive,\" how is repeating that you want somebody lynched any better? Time and again you've voted for an already suspected player, but Marble was different. It didn't take an expert to see that Marble could be scum questioning the existence of a second scum, and I've gone back and forth on Marble's alignment every time I try to post, yet you pointed it out as your entire argument and left it at that. This was such an obvious thing, you thought you had a lynch in the bag. Didn't even have to read any of his posts beyond the one to form your evidence. I believe it was chkflip who accused me of Scum Skimming, and I think that is exactly what happened here.

Just to let you know, this is not my first game, but I've played a couple games on another site, so I know my way around. <br><br>This post not be as detailed as I would have liked it, since I accidentally refreshed the page and lost a few paragraphs.<br><br>I've noticed a lot of people seem to be suspecting bez, but I didn't find anything scummy about him in particular. Going through several days' worth of posts in a few hours makes me forget things. Anyone care to elaborate on their vote for me? <br><br>I'm suspicious of PJ. I think Imat is town. These opinions are viable to change, and are mostly based on vibes.<br><br>I'd like to note that I'm kind of bummed because I was hoping for some more drama between Parama and IS after reading the first page or so worth of posts. I'd also like to say that I'm suspicious of IS because he was making such a big deal about RVS at the beginning and the amount of posts he made as the game went on has lowered quite a bit. Other than that, he hasn't done much else to make me think he is scum.<br><br>I'm wary of IS and Parama. They seem to be really experienced, and IS doesn't seem to be as tough as brick wall as I thought. Slightly suspicious of IS, and Parama seems to be leaning to town.<br><br>Maybe he's just ditched the game or is lurking, but I'd like to see some posting from E_Lou_Sive. He hasn't exactly posted anything helpful to the town, and I don't have anything to use to read him with, so I'm assuming he's scum. Anyone not posting like him, or just making fluff posts either doesn't give a damn or is scum, and mafia games with those types of people aren't fun for anyone. Hopefully whoever is soon to replace him will prove me wrong.<br><br>I find it suspicious how Peabody was making such a big deal about having a second vote on the third post during RVS. I've been in games where someone was at 4 votes before the second page and that game went alright. I'm most suspicious of Peabody, as he changed his vote to the easy newbie prey. And he seems to be ordering the vig around to kill off players he doesn't like. Seems very scummy, and I'm disappointed with the amount of posts he's made so far.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: Peabody</span><br><br>Unfortunately, I'm tired so I won't have time to give my opinions on other players. I just want to let you guys know whom I most suspect at this point. If there are any players in particular you want me to give my reads on, go ahead and ask.

Some have said this is a Towntell, but from the way he has been playing I would have to disagree. I think he saw that Marble would have to claim, and he knows Marble is his noobScum partner. Any claim made would probably be poor and a good indication of Scumminess. I think he was trying to protect Marble from having to make that claim, but he was also protecting himself by not participating in the wagon. The number of people who changed their minds on him when he did this would seem to confirm that idea. <br><br>Any Pro-Town would have waited for the claim before hammering, so why was PJ so afraid of the hammer? I'm thinking that the Scum is PJ/Marble, if the common setup is 2 and 10, or PJ/Marble and another, one I haven't yet been able to pick up. With that, I say that Marble's slip truly was Scum wondering after the existence of more Scum. I would still rather go after my stronger suspicions, however, and knock out the better player, PJ. Marble is more likely to slip up in the future, giving further evidence against him, whereas PJ is likely to get better at hiding his Scumminess."}

Assuming you are Town, if you announce your plans, it allows for scum to create their most optimal counter-attack.  This most often includes (i) deciding if your investigation is not a threat and thus not doing anything about, and thus using any scum powers for more efficient ends, or (ii) killing your investigation target from under you as Internet Stranger has alluded, or (iii) role-blocking you.  And in theme games \u2013 which this game is not \u2013 there may also be other ways to screw with investigations.<br><br>Scum should, on the whole, have to <span style=\"font-style: italic\">worry</span> about claimed Cops.  By telling the world who you choose to investigate, the scum have to worry a good deal less because it effectively tells them what they need to do to work around it.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">4.)</span> Ah.  Now that I\u2019ve checked Bezukhov\u2019s posts outside of this game, I can understand the votes on him.

I shouldn't have to point out why it's so obviously coming from a town player, and I don't think I will, because I've had to try and retype this paragraph several times to put into words what's so town about it, but I can't.

Haven't really had much to say. Also, is assuming a Mafia Roleblocker good practice? I'm asking that for lack of experience, but I wouldn't think a 2-3 man Mafia would be given a PR. And lynching a guaranteed cop would indeed be a problem, as the RB would then have the ability to block other targets and not worry about investigations.<br><br>On Marble: <br>There is simply no way to think of what he said as anything but a slip. With the multiple mafias bit, it may have been simply an error from a noobTown, but this mistake couldn't even be read as Town. And 2 such mistakes in a single game seems...Unlikely. I'm pretty sure he's just been lynched, so we'll find out the outcome soon. In the meantime I'll go back over bezu. I suspected him earlier, much earlier, but perhaps his disappearance and my reads on first PJ, then Marble as a Scummate, dropped him back under the radar for me. <br><br>Something a bit off for me: It would appear we have a group of 2 to 4 people leading the Town around. I don't like that one bit. I'm thinking somebody in that group must be Scum. 4 leaders and everybody else follows like sheep? Alarms are going off somewhere for that one. And the fact that each claims others in the group are most likely Town scares me. With the players in this game, I could see the Mafia simply taking charge and letting the less experienced among us (Myself included) simply jump to their own doom."}

(Also, I hope you don't mind me abbreviating your name.)<br><br>1. Internet Stranger-difficult leaning town: He's actively scumhunting...something I can say about less than half of the players in this game. I'd like to see every townie doing that. There should be more town-aligned, than mafia or third party-aligned. <br><br>Honestly though, can you please show me the exact posts that showed I was scum? (Since I'm *still* confused.)<br><br>2. Parama-helpful, leaning town to town: I don't like you as a player, but you're scumhunting. You can be persuasive and you write good cases. <br><br>3. Marble101-VI, *SCUM* Well, you scum slipped. If you actually had some good posts, I would be willing to give you the benefit of doubt, and say that you worded what you said wrong. Anyways, you show no sign of being town, you're either really stupid, in elementary school, or trying to act noobish, because you don't know how to be scum. <br><br>By the way, I don't think I'll ever be regretting my vote on you, since you're detrimental to the town, whether you're scum or not. <br><br>4. jilynne1991-town. duh: Well, let's see. My post said I'm town-aligned, so I must be, unles the mod screwed up, which I doubt.<br><br>5. Peabody-leaning town-null: You're posts seem town, but I do need to see some more, before I decide. <br><br>6. E_Lou_Sive-what? post more. null-I need more posts from you. You seem to be rewording what other people say. Not sure yet.<br><br>7. LittleGrey-who? post more. null: Sorry, I need more posts from you too. You slipped my mind when I was making this post, so that's a problem. <br><br>8. Slaxx-leaning town: You seem to be trying. I do need to see some scumhunting from you, but at least you're trying.<br><br>9. MarchHare-lol, ur sarcasm is interesting, leaning town: You amuse me. You seem to be trying to help, but you seem to be using a gut feeling as a read, and then making up cases, and I don't think that's how you're supposed to do it.<br><br>10. Imat-possibly scum, null (a.k.a ur confusing me)-Well, you seem to be attempting to help, but what you write is confusing me. It's like, if I decide you're scum, I can see why, but if I decide you're town, I can see why you'd be town too. So you're still kind of a null for me. <br><br>11. petroleumjelly-seems to be scum: You're posts are scummy, but you haven't scum slipped or majorly screwed up yet, so I'm still not sure about you.<br><br>12. CryMeARiver-chkflip seemed to be leaning town, so leaning town- You have pretty good judgement, but I need to see you scumhunting a bit more.<br><br>Tell me when I need to claim. I seem to be at L-1 already. (If I haven't counted wrong.)"}

There's also a lot of \"The correct way to play this game is like this, not like that\", but then he isn't always very consistent (saying that the second vote is the most important one, and then trying to downplay the importance of his own second vote for Parama).

Which is a paradox, by the way. You are coming across as too...something. Can't think of the word. But it is like you're trying to deflect all suspicions onto a player who no longer exists, as far as this game is concerned. If Bez was scummy, odds are there was a reason for it. A new player doesn't change that reason. I think that is what PJ was getting at. And I kind of agree with that."}

Sure the Town works better with a focused leader, but you've set yourselves up as the definitive group of Pro-Towns. If one among you was Scum, there'd be problems later on. I feel like it is a flaw in the strategy, one which good Scum will take advantage of."}

I don't like the idea of lynching a claimed cop, and will certainly give it another night, but I think it is something we should at least look into.<br><br>On the agenda then: Reread Day 1. It has the most information to sort through, and should reveal something of note.<br><br>As a side question to more experienced players: How many PRs does the Town typically get in a 12 man game? We've seen 1 confirmed and 1 claimed, is 2 about right? Or would there be more in this case because of more Scum. I don't have much experience in the field of role assignments on this site. I mod for my friends, but things tend to play out quite a bit differently there."}

Here's why:<br><br>1) A strange but very plausible thought popped into my head earlier: Elusive was mafia roleblocker. Marble claimed cop night 1, yet got a report. Marble should have been blocked. Now, as I said, Elusive could have just been afk as he often does, but I looked back and Parama was very sure Elusive was scum, making me think he was there for deciding the kill, and probably there for the roleblock. I think it is a possibility that the reason there were only two kills night 1 is Elusive, thinking Marble was cop, roleblocked him, but he was actually SK and missed his kill. This isn't a particularly strong thought, but its what I have right now. There are many ways we can support or disprove this idea with a mass claim. If we have a lot of PRs (not going to go into specifics for obvious reasons) we might have to consider the possibility Marble is indeed fake. If there is only 2 weak PRs or 1 strong PR left hiding in the bushes, then Marble is probably legit and either SK happened to target mafia's kill or got blocked.<br>2) It narrows down the suspect pool with clears from reports. If there is a Jailkeeper, Roleblocker, or Tracker, they need to claim TODAY if they have at least on alive clear. This forces the SK to narrow down who he kills. It also narrows down our suspect pool. I think if Marble is legit the SK will be investigation immune, so one of the three PRs above would be really helpful.<br>3) The actual PR claims get narrowed down. If SK claims PR, he is forced to continue outting reports and explaining why he is still alive.<br><br>tldr; I am for the mass claim, but I will wait on more people first."}

I would say that the SK would be on the cop's town list again here (but the cop is not leading, which btw, is not a good sign), but I think right now I am the most influential player alive, Petroleum or I anyway, so I would be looking at Preto+My town list if this was the case<br>3.

More for self preservation than anything else. I don't think he has been on the offense at all since the last scum flip.

The only way we can get confident in a lynch is slips in this behavior. Mafia are more likely to slip than SKs because they know too much. They knew, in this game, at least 2 other players, and that changed how they behaved towards those players. Our job, as Town, is to weed out these slips through pressure and \"deductive reasoning\" before we are outnumbered. If somebody is literally trying to act Anti-Town, they would be in a whole heap of trouble.<br><br>Peabody, this would probably be a good time to claim. And to pipe up. Which is probably hypocritical coming from me at this stage of the game. I really haven't been able to keep my head in this.<br><br>Beck brings up some interesting points. Hey Beck, your thoughts on Peabody vs IS? You can wait until after the claim, if it comes, but I'd like to know where you're sitting at for those two. For instance, if Peabody/IS is lynched today (Looking more like the former, but things can change quickly in this game) and flips Town, will you try to get the other lynched the following day? Or would this change your opinions of some players enough to push a different lynch?<br><br>IS, you say you're playing the \"cull the herd\" game. Who is next on your \"herd\" list if peabody is lynched today and flips Town? Also, do you think it is entirely appropriate to play said game yet? It is difficult to catch a good SK in a slip, because they only know a little bit more than the rest of us, but could it be that the SK has already slipped, and a careful read could generate some clues?<br><br>Here's where I stand: Peabody is currently the Scummiest to me. I'm not sold on him, but the next in line is Cookie. I'm wary of his claim. It would be so easy, as the SK, to mime a Cop by simply handing out Innocent results. Then again, he did investigate some of the top suspects. Giving innocents would be risky on those. Which actually changes my opinion mid-typing. After Peabody would be IS, then Beck.<br><br>IS's reactions are way too over-the-top. There is really no call to lash out because a single person voices concerns over your gameplay. And lash out he has.<br><br>As for Beck: He comes in here and immediately accuses somebody. Not Scummy. However, he makes it a point to say that both himself and Petro are Confirmed Town. This could have been a simple case of not knowing about Cop-immune SKs, yet it could also have been trying to keep himself out of suspicions. The weakest of my suspicions, yet I'm going to keep him in mind as the Day continues."}

I didn't mention your name either, so why did you think it was directed at you?<br><br>The only lynch I'm ok with is Peabody today. I think he is Scum. Yet I won't stop hunting just because I may have found Scum. That would be silly. Clearly you lot are doing the same thing. <br><br>So here's the real problem: If, on any other day, somebody had asked somebody who they would prefer to lynch and how they would react to that player's role, it would have been fine. People are wondering where other players are at, some want confirmation of their own suspicions, others want to know if they missed something. Now it is anathema. I would point out that nothing has changed. If the SK would ask those questions today, they would be asking the same questions, for the same reasons, yesterday. And yet Day 1 and Day 2, which saw this behavior, aren't being scrutinized. Wouldn't it actually be more beneficial to check out the previous days, when the SK knew he/she was safe from scrutiny? They could easily target those most Town-like, seeing as how we've all been making nice, detailed lists for them, which wouldn't really narrow down our suspect pool in the slightest. But to ask those same questions now is simply asking for scrutiny. The SK wants to lie low, stay off radars as long as possible. I ask you, does that post look like something you would post in an attempt to \"lay low?\" It doesn't to me.<br><br>Here's how I see it, and I'll answer my own questions to some extent in the process: Peabody is the most likely suspect. Based on his overall behavior, he has been most Scummy. So I'll vote to lynch Peabody today. If he flips Town, always a possibility, I'll be looking at IS tomorrow. The SK, of all of us, is the only one who doesn't care who, besides himself, gets lynched. He/she is also the only one who cares, to any huge extent, whether or not he/she gets lynched. IS's planned strategy is to \"cull the herd,\" a plan which invariably has a \"Don't care who gets lynched\" attitude behind it. IS also overreacts to every attack on his person. I think he'll be the good backup lynch if Peabody flips Town. After IS, I don't really have a plan. This is what my reading has come to so far. If you want to lynch me to get me out of the way as a suspect, fine. It'll ruin the record, but the win is all I really care about."}

Making cases up as you go along is putting on blinders to the truth.  It's called tunneling.  A person can say anything and then make a case to prove it.

If me repeating that I want discussion is \"useless and counterproductive,\" how is repeating that you want somebody lynched any better? Time and again you've voted for an already suspected player, but Marble was different. It didn't take an expert to see that Marble could be scum questioning the existence of a second scum, and I've gone back and forth on Marble's alignment every time I try to post, yet you pointed it out as your entire argument and left it at that. This was such an obvious thing, you thought you had a lynch in the bag. Didn't even have to read any of his posts beyond the one to form your evidence. I believe it was chkflip who accused me of Scum Skimming, and I think that is exactly what happened here. You spotted an easy BW and ran with it.</div></blockquote><br>This case one PJ looks legit, and from that point forward, I considered Imat a town read until recently.  The fact that he said he was wavering between reads on Marble helped me out because there was a lot of confusion on Marble at that time.  <br><br>However, I also see A LOT of theory talk which I've seen in scum before (talk about second votes, how 'discussion' helps, whether Marble was noobtown/noobscum/or even pro scum, etc).<br><br>Lining up lynches for the next couple days caught my attention today, and the 'regardless of my alignment' talk/theory talk is icing on my case.

Even though the whole \"Good Luck!\" post makes me grimace, I think he is Town.  Although multiple players say Peabody is not really coming up with his own cases (or something to that effect, I don't claim I really understand the \"case\" on him), when I read his posts it looks to me like he has constantly revised his opinions and seems to be genuinely hunting for scum.  Though I understand a SK could just as well do the same thing (and I also think Slaxx has done a convincing job of adjusting his reads throughout the game), it has simply felt very genuine.  And more often than not, it feels like when Peabody starts to second-guess a wagon, it is usually somewhat against-the-grain, and just as importantly, he seems to pretty accurate when he's done it.  Additionally, Peabody's start to today pretty much mirrored my thoughts exactly: overnight, I had given the game a quick read, and decided that LittleGrey would probably get my vote if I survived the night.  So I was a bit surprised that LittleGrey was killed at all, and from what I can tell, so was Peabody.  Still, the biggest niggling doubt for me is that LittleGrey did express moderate suspicion of Peabody, but it's not enough to push me into thinking Peabody is scum here.<br><br>I also think Marble101 is Town, barring something interesting from a mass-claim.  I suspect Beck is probably Town -- and at the very least he is mostly my pool today because of the investigation result on him, <span style=\"font-style: italic\">just</span> in case Marble101 still gives is significant results.<br><br>So I am pretty much left with a pool of three players: {Imat, Slaxx, Internet Stranger}.  Of the three, I still prefer an Imat lynch.  Internet Stranger is next, and Slaxx would be last.<br><br>I would still like a mass-claim.  If we can narrow down our lynches to three players right now, we will win the game because we have three lynches left.  If y'all decide not to lynch Peabody, I still strongly suggest that when Imat is replaced, we pressure his replacement into claiming <span style=\"font-style: italic\">immediately</span> and before reading the game.  And then we can wrap-up mass-claiming in a timely manner."}

Otherwise, he paints himself into a corner and loses since we would run out of cleared suspects and it would come back to him.<br>Like this:<br>Day 3: 7 alive, 2 confirmed, 4 unconfirmed, 1 cop(?)<br>Day 4: 5 alive, 2 confirmed, 2 unconfirmed, 1 cop(?)<br>Day 5: 3 alive, 1 confirmed, 1 unconfirmed, 1 cop(?)<br><br>If what Marble says is true, then the only suspects are Slaxx, Imat, Peabody, IS. <br><br>Slaxx has been trying to act like a White Knight all game, that deserves death just in itself.<br>Peabody has been coasting most of the game, thats a definite scum trait.<br>Imat hasnt really contributed all that much, another case for being the last scum.<br><br>For now:<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Unvote: Marchhare</span></div></blockquote><br>Essentially, Internet Stranger had just had another prospective Town temporarily taken out of his pool of potential mislynches.  And given how on Day Three the Serial Killer needed three mislynches to win, it cuts against him that Internet Stranger's first order of business was to make everybody look suspicious, rather than trying to decide if somebody is Town.<br><br>And then, Internet Stranger promptly suggested that the Serial Killer intentionally did not kill on Night One:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Internet Stranger, Post 731 wrote:</cite>So the serial killer is just laying in the bushes avoiding kills until now just for the explicit purpose of impersonating scum later?</div></blockquote><br>Which, as I quickly pointed out in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3152118#p3152118\" class=\"postlink\">Post 734</a>, is a rather absurd jump to make given the multitude of things that could explain a missing kill.  Given Internet Stranger\u2019s experience, I am more than comfortable in saying he knows better than to jump to the most unlikely conclusion over explanations which are far more probable.  This post in particular feels like a contrived attempt to show ignorance about the goings-on of the Serial Killer."}

I don't know =/. Marble was in fact the cop. I wanted you to feel that you had inside information when in fact you didn't v_v.<br>Or I'm forgetful.........<br><br>And I think the reason i put DK as VT was because Marble in fact did investigate you. I knew the game was over (in that slaxx lost <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\"> ) and therefore didn't bother to check. STupid error and I will never repeat that again.<br><br>Slaxx coulda won this game if he had killed Marble (as he intended), but fear of the doc protect (I assume) made him switch. Although he played an excellent game."}
