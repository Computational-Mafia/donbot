All <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=6470\" class=\"postlink\">site rules</a> apply.<br>2. Be nice. Mafia games can get heated but remember never to attack the person.<br>3. Play to your wincon.<br>4. Days are approximately 14 days long, nights are approximately 48 hours long. Extensions may be given the circumstances warrant it.<br>5. Failure to post at least once every 48 hours will result in a prod. If you do not pick up your prod in 24 hours, or if I have to prod you a fourth time, I will look for a replacement.<br>6. <span class=\"noboldsig\">Please</span> put votes in this format: <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Something_Smart</span>. Technically, bolded votes are allowed (<span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: Something_Smart</span>), but they are a lot harder to see. It's easier for you and easier for me. In case you don't know, you can vote with:<br><dl class=\"codebox\"><dt>Code: <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"selectCode(this); return false;\">Select all</a></dt><dd><code>[vote]Something_Smart[/vote]</code></dd></dl><br>and unvote with<br><dl class=\"codebox\"><dt>Code: <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"selectCode(this); return false;\">Select all</a></dt><dd><code>[unvote][/unvote]</code></dd></dl><br>Unvotes are not necessary to change your vote.<br>7. If more than half the players are voting for a player, then that player is lynched and removed from the game, and the day will end. If the deadline is reached before a lynch occurs, the day will end without a lynch.<br>8. If you have a question for me, put it in bold and say <span class=\"noboldsig\">@Mod</span> or <span class=\"noboldsig\">@Something_Smart</span>. If it's not something you want made public, feel free to shoot me a PM.<br>9. <span style=\"color: #FFBF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">This lovely shade of yellow (#FFBF00) is the mod color.</span></span></span> Do not use it. Do not impersonate me.<br>10. Do not discuss this game in any other thread except in PTs created specifically for this game. Do not discuss any other ongoing game in this thread.<br>11. Do not quote any out-of-thread communications with me or with any other player.<br>12. The day after you are lynched or nightkilled, you may make one \"bah!\" post with no game-related information in it.<br>13. Do not pretend to break any of these rules. Pretending to break a rule is punishable just as harshly as actually breaking it.<br>14. My word is law. Just because it is not stated here does not mean that it is acceptable. I am generally a nice person and will give you a warning if you do something I don't approve of, but it's always better to ask than risk the consequences (see rule 7).<br>15. This game is <span style=\"color: #FF0000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">3 mafia-aligned players</span></span> versus <span style=\"color: #00FF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">10 town-aligned players</span></span>.<br>16. Mafia members may kill and use a personal action in the same night.<br>17. The Mafia have unrestricted daytalk in this game.<br>18. This game follows the <a href=\"http://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Normal_Game\" class=\"postlink\">Normal Guidelines</a>. At least one player has the following role PM:<br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Welcome, XXXX, to Mini 1836: Space Mafia!<br><br>You are a <span style=\"color: #00FF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Vanilla Townie.</span></span><br>You have no special abilities.

No way town makes that post. It's obvious he was sharing his thoughts and even VI's (which I didn't get the impression he was) and n00bs (which he probably is) are perfectly capable of doing. He's an easy target for scum to go after.  Then I saw the very next post and that screams scum. Who freaking cares if massive dropped an Rvs vote and didn't comment on anything else. It's not AI at all. You then accuse him of ignoring the game which you don't even know it's true(which he later confirms isn't). <br><br>It's basically seems like you are trying too hard and being very manipulative"}

I'm gonna just rebut your last statement; You should care that Greens are heading towards miss lynching you.

I think this attitude may hurt your game in the long run unless you can build a stable meta (like the one I've been building as town for a few games now.) Still if you do have that kinda stable meta, it may be best to point it out like I generally do second post.

Given this, it's pretty likely that if you're being lynched, scum is involved, and it's your duty as town to at least find out the arguments to see if they're legit in any way. Cause if they're not, and you say so, not only do you have a chance of someone else realizing it too, and thereby not dying, you also have a good chance of catching scum.<br><br>Why shouldn't you care if someone wants to lynch you?

I can't make that call, Its like trying to choose someones alignment based on a single argument. Yeah it was incorrect, but I can over look that part as; we as Greens don't know anyones alignment and being so close to that thing I didn't want to judge you for it, as it was my fault for using another colour. I felt that Nos was kinda lurking so thought I'd go that way as I had no majorly strong reads."}

So my gimmick isn't a liability.<br><br>2. What strong disagreements exactly? <br><br>2A. This is a game where people are often going to agree and disagree. Like for example you strongly disagree with anyone who wants to lynch Naomi. I'd say right now that you have the strongest disagreement in the game so if we used your own logic people should be lynching you because you strongly disagree with people<br><br>3. Why would having ne at lylo be an issue? I have shown that i am able to use logic and reason when I have the proper time. <br><br>your reasons for wanting me lynched are terrible. if you are town you should be ashamed of yourself."}

I feel that reds would made more of an effort to push something with his level of post frequency. <br><br>itlepip<br>&lt;Pre-Iso*&gt; Didn't have any stand out memoryies<br>&lt;Post-Iso*&gt; Eh after reading they read pretty Green right now.. they look like they are trying to work out the game and its pretty stable to me.<br><br>grapes<br>&lt;Pre-Iso*&gt; I dunno how I feel about them. a little opportunistic could just be brashness.. <br>&lt;Post-Iso&gt; I'm still a bit on the fence after my ISO read. there are a few things that I find a little scummy such as the simple plan vote <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8384889#p8384889\">440</a> <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8371163#p8371163\">441 </a> and then on a later post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8385157#p8385157\">486</a> he implys that Simple plan is scummy. I can see him Scum reading me based on how he looked at my stuff though. I'm just thinking its a case of him not playing with me before so.. takes a while for him to switch to understanding how I play. But then there are greenish things like this request for a read list. which was a good idea and something good for the game as it gives more content. So i'm just rather on the fence about  this entire thing.<br><br>MariaR<br>&lt;Pre-Iso*&gt; Pretty much what I expect out of MariaR will be later in the game where I can work her out.. so yeah<br>&lt;Post-Iso&gt; Sigh.. Okay one of my stronger green! reads. MariaR has played with me before and understands sorta how I act/play the game and If she was !red motivated I feel she would be taking what would be a nearly free lynch on her part. The fact she stepped upto the plate to defend me just confirms her Green status to me. as there is no major !Red motivation for doing so.<br><br>Xkfyu<br>&lt;Pre-Iso&gt; Ehh.. I feel like he is taking an easy vote on myself.. but .. its kinda hard to punish him for that... so.. yeah People who havn't played with me, refuse to look at my meta and ignore my self meta tend to get these red flags that he is voting me for.. its a little cheap but I sorta live with that being a thing.<br>&lt;Post-Iso&gt; Okay. looking over them I think they are likely a Green! player who is just miss reading myself (partly on the color thing, maybe not taking my meta into account) but thats fine. there iso reads like someone who is taking the time to read and try to understand the game finding things to comment and ask about and generally reading people as they go. So.. Green Leaning.<br><br>massive<br>&lt;Pre-Iso&gt; Thinking the colour thing was a genuine Red slip kinda makes me sad inside but I don't really wanna lynch him yet because its such an easy thing to OMGUS I just hope that at some point down the line he will get that I'm Green Aligned and that kinda asorbs most my thoughts on his activities.<br>&lt;Post-Iso&gt; I think this MIGHT be his green game... I did play with them recently and it does KINDA feel the same.. but its really hard to tell as I found them suspicious there too.. I guess I just have a hard time grasping massive... But he does seem committed to my lynch and that still is kinda sad.. I guess I gotta null read them.<br><br>gerryoat<br>&lt;Pre-Iso&gt; Err... struggling to remember any stand out Green or Red moments on this one.. so.. guess not much to put here<br>&lt;Post-Iso&gt; Err.. Well this is.. why I forgot him at least..; So he hasn't really spoke much for the first 500 odd posts just kinda lurking with the occasional post.. and then he just kinda goes ape on two-face.. As I'm Green reading Two-face it kinda doens't work with me.. and the huge lurkyness with a lack of reads is also unhealthy... he is either a bad-Green or a Red... but.. he says he is better after day1 so I'd like to give him another day regardless.. I think he would be my lynch pick of the day if he hadn't said that..<br><br>Dunnstral<br>&lt;Pre-Iso&gt; Still think they are probably Green<br>&lt;Post-Iso&gt; Wow.. this massive tunnel.. voted Zach page 66 and still on him 600 posts later XD but placing that on the; NAI Pile lets get back to the ISO ... urgh.. Okay.. not so keen on them now :s I think there reactions are just too.. aggressive? like i'm reading this as a player who was hammered (metaphorically speaking) but a Red  player last game so hard that I broke and started ignoring them whenever possible.. and it seems like he is reading both his Red picks mostly on meta, which is cool and all... but at the same time I feel like he ignored the meta for the game we just finished that he modded.. I'm wondering if he read the main thread now.. as I feel that if he was reading along he should of had more of a Green vibe only the color thing standing out, which he ignored anyway. I am curious to know what his thoughts on Red!Maria is in relation to his previous play with them compared to this game though.<br><br>This block is poorly worded.. Sorry town. bit muddled up here.<br><br>Nosferatu<br>&lt;Pre-Iso&gt; I find there play style a little suspicious but For now I'm still giving them the benefit of the doubt. <br>&lt;Post-Iso&gt;Bleh.. rather light in stuff... so.. For now.. my fos will stand. Just seems like there not trying to solve just stating kinda known stuff or making funnies.. there is no real meat to there posts yet.. which is kinda hard for me to read them on .. im gonna Slight!Red this<br><br>Zachstralkita<br>&lt;Pre-Iso&gt; I really struggle to Red read him... they are just cute.. and thats my greatest weakness..<br>&lt;Post-Iso&gt; Okay pretty sure they are Green.. there seems to be a fair bit of game solving going on and looking critically at peoples posts which I like. I have a much stronger read than last time now. so thats good. <br><br>*These parts was written in on monday and do not reflect changes in my opinion from then till now<br><br><br><br>This has been kinda a weird game for me. the color slip thing has tarnished my usual Day 1 play where I post my meta post then do my normal thing with people all thinking i'm townie by the end of the day. with this slip its made most people go that I'm red and thats tricky for me as I know and understand why those who see me that way would do so. which means I'm kinda now having to adapt and use other people I think are green to look for reds rather than myself.. which is kinda a weird thing as I don't really know who is town? so.. yeah.."}

I think it may be some time to look in depth at this now... I guess when I next get hours to work with i'll go back over and work on this. Sorry kinda a strange post, beacuse I'm not sure if it'll lead anywhere and dunno what I'll find but massive has at least given me an idea and when I'm done i'll share all the results I can that might be useful to us."}

What massive inspired me to do was take a look at the people on my train and try to use that to see who red is. The theory goes as followed;<br><br>Okay so for now I'm going to do a bit of roleplay with myself. in this part I'm playing the part of a Red player.<br>We have just started a new game. One of the players is a bit quirky and bubbly might be a gimmick account. Just posted a bunch of NAI Wifom admitting they do lots of things that can be scum read as town. This can be useful. The player just accidentally called town blue instead of green and given their content so far they are not the best player. Looks like an Easy lynch. So I'll vote.<br><br>This Is the example of the red thought pattern going into my train. Seeing a weaker player make what can easily be placed as a red slip they decide to push on it as its a really easy misslynch if they cannot stop people attacking the red slip but then I come out stronger than they expect and by this point most people who started on that train have backed off due to my content and other reasons (im sure everyone has there own) <br><br>Now continuing on. Lets have a look at each player on my train at some stage (mostly focusing around the events time nothing for the stuff after right now) We have; <br>A Simple Plan <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8376857#p8376857\">282</a><br>grapes <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8384893#p8384893\">441</a><br>Massive <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8375060#p8375060\">210</a><br>Xkfyu <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8375083#p8375083\">211</a><br><br>Now Given I'm Green and know I'm green (no matter where you stand on me right now, Just roll with me here) Lets say everything I have said is true and you was a red player? Now some of you would leap at it. its a real free kill that'll have next to no repercussions. Easy to quickly vote and if it turns out there good. no problem unvote till later. Others of you would want to vote but want to have more of a reason than; thats a red slip.. those players would wait till a bit later to post. Now.. I don't believe the entire red team would go in on it. as there are some people who might see it as a bait or just think it's a bit too easy.<br><br>I will say however, that I expect at least 1 scum member minamum to take the free kill.. so out of the 4 players I am gonna take an explore and see which one is most likely to be scum.<br>Starting with the first;<br><br>Massive - He hesitated at first. he was unsure about my slip at first and questioned it. It was only after a misinterpretation that he finally voted and started my bandwagon. Now.. lets look at <br><br>Green!Massive; <br>Okay so now I'm going to roleplay as massive!Green.<br>This player just called Town Blue instead of green. I would of missed it, but someone pointed it out to me, (\u275a\u275a) Okay So Pausing for a second; If Massive thought this way, it would lead to a more Greenish veiw on Dun; now looking back we can see in; <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8375901#p8375901\">264</a> Just this he is questioning Dunn why he too didn't vote having pointed it out, this makes sense from a Green!Massive Perspective. Moving onwards. (\u25ba) I voted them after pressing the issue and getting what I see as a second scum slip. (see latter half of <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8375060#p8375060\">210</a>) As Naomi couldn't give me a satisfactory explanation I kept my vote on them until bigger threats came about. (\u25a0)  This here follows rather cleanly. You can read the thoughts as it goes and see his confliction on someone he had a town read on suddenly slipping like this.<br><br>Red!Massive <br>Okay Naomi is acting like she did in our last town game. She should be a NK as she generally is obvious and townie. I'll just town read her. Wait she just slipped.. Well I can't shoot her late game lets push her and tunnel right now. Looks like this lynch won't happen I'll switch to two face. (\u25a0) Okay so... looking at this its pretty okay bar a few things, it doesn't explain why he was questioning dunn and why he didn't vote right away in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8374954#p8374954\">198</a><br><br>Massive; Conclusion<br>Given his posts It makes much more sense to have a massive!Green than a Massive!Red as scum he wouldn't feel the need to hesitate partially as he has seen me play before and knows im really strong at making town read me as town. So to make use of a miss step like the one I did he would had to act quickly and that wasn't really evident in his post directly following changing blue to green. <br><br>Reference List; Massive<br>Green!Massive - <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8375060#p8375060\">210</a> (His vote post) <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8372748#p8372748\">78</a> (My Slip Post) <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8374917#p8374917\">196</a> (Post I started calling town green) <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8372782#p8372782\">81</a> (Dunn pointing it out) <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8375901#p8375901\">264</a> (Him questioning why dun didn't post) <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8371163#p8371163\">770 </a>(Where he voted someone else) <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8371163#p8371163\">194 </a>(His town read on me) <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8374954#p8374954\">198</a> (Him hesitating and questioning if I am scum)<br><br>Red!Massive - <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8371163#p8371163\">194 </a>(His town read on me) <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8372748#p8372748\">78</a> (My Slip Post) <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8375060#p8375060\">210</a> (His vote post) <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8371163#p8371163\">770 </a>(Where he voted someone else) <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8374954#p8374954\">198</a> (Him hesitating and questioning if I am scum)<br><br>Okay, So next person Xkfyu -they havn't played with me before so is not used to my play style.<br><br>Green!Xkfyu<br>Okay this new person has come in with a lamist/NAI post. I don't like self meta and don't really trust it and cba to check her meta. Hmm she seems slightly scummy based on her activities. Oh and Massive pointed out a slip time to vote! eh taking some pressure better make a follow up post explaining why (\u275a\u275a) Okay I'm just gonna pause a second as I think its important to note now, that I'm struggling to come up with Green! reasoning going forward from here. but I'll attempt it. (\u25ba) Hmm Well I guess I could mention how I hesitated voting for her before 211... Okay I guess Naomi has been doing stuff... time to switch to someone else. I guess I'll vote Gerryoat (\u25a0) Okay.. So.. the jumps here are kinda big and don't really chain well together but gonna look at this from Red! view and see if that makes less sense<br><br>Red!Xkfyu<br>Okay this new person has come in with this WIFOM/LAMIST/NAI post. Hmm.. there content is kinda strange and weak. they are doing just what they said looks like a pretty easy day one scapegoat/miss lynch target. I'll scum read them as I'm not sure how good they are later. OH snap! that Blue for Green mix up! this looks like an Easy vote for free!. Votes. Hmm.. looks like they want reasoning.. I'll say its psychology as its hard to argue against. Hmm.. looks like she gave lots of examples of why she could of done it..  but town still seem suspicious i'll just hold. Okay i'm taking a bit of heat. lets just disperse the pressure by saying I don't believe her early post and am scum reading her for those things.. okay. two face seems a little lost lets restate why i'm voting and I guess I can justify not voting right away. Hmm.. this miss lynch isn't happening I'll switch to gerryoak as he is getting a bit of heat(\u25a0) Okay so this chains much neater post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8371163#p8371163\">509 </a> Is still a bit out of place but it fits much smoother.<br><br>Xkfyu; Conclusion<br>So.. New people who play with me often get this miss impression that I'm an easy miss lynch with my play style having lamist and fear of lynching and other Red flags built in. However, Scum who havn't played with me often make the mistake of seeing me as an easy target early on before I start kicking my major posts like this one out. This mistake is something they often note going on and start backing off. Xkfyu matches this pattern and given some of his posts such as <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8383157#p8383157\">410</a> Its obvious that he didn't check my meta out. This leads me to believe he would not be able to expect me bursting my longer read posts and now this post out on red. His Red! meta matches much better than his Green!meta and it also matches a Red! view on Gerryoat. Someone he barely mentioned suddenly got his vote over someone who 'slipped' in his mind. as Green! there is little to no reason to switch to Oat and I also think his vote switch onto me was more 'sudden' and reactionary than hesitant like he said. In my mind Xkfyu is likely a Red now. <br><br>Xkfyu Reference List;<br>Green!Xkfyu<br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8371163#p8371163\">78 </a><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8371163#p8371163\">79 </a>(my introduction post he disbelieved) <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8372795#p8372795\">83</a> (proof he understood the post unused in both green and red but thought I'd note it anyway.) <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8371163#p8371163\">185 </a> (when he voices feeling im slightly scummy with no reasons given but used in both red and green) <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8371163#p8371163\">211 </a>(His Vote Post) <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8375203#p8375203\">214</a>(His follow up post giving a short explanation on his vote) <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8371163#p8371163\">409 </a>(him explaining what he meant by psychological)<br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8383157#p8383157\">410</a> (A short follow up restating his reasons for voting me with a more proper and real explanation) <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8371163#p8371163\">417 </a>(an unrelated and unused post of interest that other people might get more out of) <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8387243#p8387243\">509</a> (Mention of this hesitance and his reason again) <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8391357#p8391357\">768</a> (his vote switch to Gerryoat)<br><br>Red!Xkfyu<br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8371163#p8371163\">78 </a><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8371163#p8371163\">79 </a>(my introduction post he disbelieved) <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8372795#p8372795\">83</a> (proof he understood the post unused in both green and red but thought I'd note it anyway.)

I think the second post he did is more likely to be scum motivated but with so little to go on there is no way to easily cut this so its kinda a null result leaning on scumish. but without more information it would be impossible to tell and after this post too easy to forge.<br><br>A Simple Plan; Refrences<br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8376857#p8376857\">282</a> <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8384703#p8384703\">438</a><br><br>Okay last person Grapes - Much later onto the train he joined around A Simple Plans prod So lets go. No puns intended on the following area<br><br>Green!Grapes <br>Okay. So.. A rookie player sorta slipped with the color thing.. but thats mostly NAI. But that read list is a bit meh and that null vote is way too safe. Okay.. I see a quote wall with a lot of scummy things.. Yeah you know what I'll vote. Hmm.. Naomi isn't really doing anything too scummy.. while dunn is been pushing softly for a while and shading. lets switch over. (\u25a0) This follows a clear logical path I partially like the double post hesitation before finally voting me. I would think Red! players would just vote on that right away and changing to dunn is MUCH cleaner than X's movements off me.<br><br>Red!Grapes Okay So a rookie player made a colour mess up. too easy I'll say I'm not town reading her for that while still saying I'm scum reading her. Hmm another player made a post with a bunch of reasons to vote naomi lets jump on that train. Hmm.. this isn't going anywhere but dunn is about to pick up so lets jump there (\u25a0) This on the other hand makes kinda big leaps in logic and doens't path too well..<br><br>Grapes Conclusion; <br>Given there actions It seems far more likely that Grapes is Green aligned rather than Red aligned if he was a red player he could of gone onto me when I did the slip and read list citing his dislike of it. with multiple players on it at that time it would of also made sense and helped build momentum but waiting until later and hesitating is much more a Green move like he couldn't choose if I was Red or Green but was convinced by a simple plan. <br><br>Grapes References;<br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8371163#p8371163\">293 </a>(where he says he didn't think I scum slipped but thinks im scummy for my read list) <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8371163#p8371163\">440 </a>(His reaction to ASP's post part 1) <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8371163#p8371163\">441 </a>(His reaction to ASP's post part 2) <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8394627#p8394627\">856</a> (his dun vote) <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8371163#p8371163\">860 </a>(Some of his dun reasons; there are many reasons why scattered before this vote too it wasn't a sudden jump, for more Grapes thinking dun is suspicious posts please iso grapes there are a bunch of them)<br><br>Final Conclusion<br>Over all I think that Massive and Grapes was Green on my train. given the reasons above and there reactions. I also think that ASP COULD be Green as well but there is no way to tell.. however, I find Xkfyu Actions fit much more neatly into the Red Bracket. This was a lot of leg work and typing but I hope it was worth it. So thoughts would be nice. But for now I'm resting my arms because my god this was a lot of typing and I hope it puts in context my votes over the last couple days as I have been influenced by writting this post (I started on Wednesday inspired by Massives post where he said so much information would be given on his flip)"}

We have different point of views on them and maybe I'm missing something, and I'd like to adjust my reads based on that.<br><br>You said you have seen them play as &gt;&gt;mafia&lt;&lt; before, and they are behaving as &gt;&gt;town&lt;&lt; so far.<br><br>I'm sorry if you find me too picky here. But this statement doesn't make too much sense to me.<br><br>My interpretation is that you said: \"I've seen grapes play as mafia before [and I don't see their scumtells so far], therefore I'm reading them as town\". <br><br>But is that the right conclusion? Why not just neutral? what makes them different from your other neutral reads?</div></blockquote><br><br>I think they're town because I think they're not mafia<br><br>It's not the lack of \"scumtells\", it's Grapes acting contrary. I Know meta can change and all but from what I've seen Grapes as scum knows how to get people to relax around them in a way, and they look like they're scumhunting and helping town. Whereas Grapes here is all over the place, honestly doesn't seem to know what they're doing and seems understandably confused having drawn town. And they don't have the facade. Unfortunately the \"competence\" aura doesn't seem to have transferred over as Grapes really does appear to be washed up town here</div></blockquote><br><br>This was 100% why I had an early townread on Grapes, it dissipated a bit on reread but I remember having Grapes as my top town in the beginning of the game for this reason.<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8387864#p8387864\" class=\"postlink\">post 538</a>, Dunnstral wrote:</cite>Willimg to lynch MariaR</div></blockquote><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8387866#p8387866\" class=\"postlink\">post 539</a>, Dunnstral wrote:</cite>And Zach</div></blockquote><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8390692#p8390692\" class=\"postlink\">post 722</a>, Dunnstral wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8390651#p8390651\" class=\"postlink\">post 717</a>, TwoFace wrote:</cite>I'm not into policy lynches but if itlepip, Gerry, or something smart got to l-1 I'd hammer.</div></blockquote><br><br> :?: itlepip is pretty towny</div></blockquote><br>My only worry with my Dunn read is that maybe I got pocketed, but I think is makes so much sense for TownDunn to give me the townread he has and in the way that he has that this sort of defending for me also seems really towny.<br><br><br>pedit: good timing."}

The existence of one has no effect on the existence of the other. When thinking about game balance, no mod has ever said \"Well, I have an Ecryptor in the game, I guess I can't include a Roleblocker.\"<br><br>Setups are balanced based on Town vs Scum PRs, not Mafia vs Mafia PRs. Ie any combination of Mafia PRs can exist, given the right combination of Town PRs, and vice versa.<br><br>Therefore, if you were trying to find correlations between different PRs, in an attempt to determine whether or not there really is a Roleblocker, then you'd be better served by looking for the existence of Mafia Roleblockers when there is a Town Tracker in the game.<br><br>However, don't do this either, because this is also a waste of time, and here's why.<br><br>With the exception of a select few semi-uncommon roles that resolve before the roleblocks, a Mafia Roleblocker directly counters any active Town PR. Therefore, any game in which Town has an active PR, a Mafia Roleblocker is a viable role to include in the setup.<br><br>And since we already know that itlepip was a Tracker (an active Town PR), we know that the existence of a Mafia Roleblocker is possible.<br><br>That's pretty much as good as we can get right now. However, if you are set on doing this kind of research, what you should be looking for is what is the percentage of Mini Normal games that included a Mafia Roleblocker out of the total number of Mini Normal games in which a Mafia Roleblocker was a viable role.<br><br><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8449980#p8449980\" class=\"postlink\">post 2100</a>, Toto wrote:</cite>@Xk: If I'm wasting my time I'm open to suggestions of what to do instead.

He does put effort in. I just don't think it was from the right place. the trick of red is to do enough to look green without being green and pushing the red agenda. The iso read looks at individual posts.. Roleplay posts take much more time as I have to speculate in my head possible red and green positions then cross reference the material and try to find the best fit which is like trying to slot circle pegs into square holes.. it can be done but it takes time. iso posts already burn my brain out without the extra effort of trying to roleplay everyone at once.."}

It had no relation to my general feelings on him which up until his roleclaim was just nullish, neither good nor bad. however, when he claimed RB and claimed to have targeted someone other than the person we know was roleblocked I instantly changed my stance. Check the tone in my vote post to after his claim. You can tell one of them is like my votes late yesterday where I'm just looking to prevent a no lynch and not really keen on it but supporting it so we don't no lynch.. then when he claimed my tone did shift as it doesn't match up the actions we know happened at night."}

It had no relation to my general feelings on him which up until his roleclaim was just nullish, neither good nor bad. however, when he claimed RB and claimed to have targeted someone other than the person we know was roleblocked I instantly changed my stance. Check the tone in my vote post to after his claim.

I was mostly frustrated by the fact that I don't understand why scum would play the way they did. The only alternative to Zach not being scum is that you were scum. So I spent some time thinking about possibility and the only thing that was suspicious was your role. So I spent more time thinking about it and thought your role was too OP considering the other roles. So my frustration comes from the fact that this game doesn't make any sense to me.<br><br>If you can't understand how that can make me frustrated then we've lost already.

That was by design. They keep calling each other scum and other names without really questioning each other. There is no real game solving here. Just a show that was meant to pollute the thread and make them look like they are not partners.<br><br>That\u2019s the same with pretty much all of his \u201creads\u201d.<br><br>His scum read on me never changed throughout the game. He never did any serious attempt to actually question me. To solve the game. Notice the difference how you and grapes reacted to me when you thought I was scum. He says I slipped under his radar lately where I have been a consistent scum read of his. He was probably leaving me for last because he knows I\u2019m the easiest lynch and you were scum reading me at some point too.<br><br>Same for Xk. He says he is scum all the game but never does anything to actually question the guy. Pure shading, zero game solving. Xk was one of the strongest and more logical players on the game and notice how badly he wanted to get rid of him not just yesterday but the previous days too.<br><br>His massive tunnel was the same shit.<br><br>The main tell in Zach\u2019s ISO is the lack of actual game solving. All he does is pollute the thread with filler posts, and make half-arsed pushes that makes him look like he is doing something but when you look closely there is no real bone behind it. He doesn't expose his neck. His reads never adapt based on new information because they are not real reads, and there is no new information for him because he is mafia.<br><br>Look at his behavior in the last 3 days. He is voting but never really tried to game solve or provide reasons why he is voting.<br><br>I'll pull more stuff later."}

I never scumread him. He played different from the other game I was in with him where he was also scum<br><br><br>Ya my ISO screams scum.. like that was the goal for a scum player. You are just pandering to TwoFace trying to get this win handed to you.<br><br>I'm pretty sure JKing me was Dunn's final refuge. I doubt he planned for things to play out as they did but it still benefits him and it does even more in terms of people seeing me as scum. You and Nosferatu were more to the side but was the central player in the team. He just drew too much attention to himself which will inevitably be why you lose here. I know him, his personality is too loud and if he does not have scumpartners that can make him not seem as overt he will probably not be very compatible with them.<br><br>If you look at Dunn's ISO it looks like he played a really shitty game but it seemed deliberate. Dunn always tunnels me so I wouldn't have scumread him for doing that. A few  on this player list are familiar with him so I doubt they would have either. It probably was a subterfuge to coast and his contigency plan was to JK me. I presume that's why I was kept alive, because almost no one save for grapes agreed with me fully and if I was kept alive there would be no credence to Dunn being scum in the town's eye because the guy who was presumably the loudest threat to him was kept alive. I'm pretty sure I only agreed with TwoFace about massive at the time. Toto has yet to show where I've sheeped anything. You just said a bunch of shit that I did and next to it put your own explanations to support your agenda. This is different from those posts actually supporting your agenda because you're making up an entirely new intention for them.<br><br>You said I bussed Dunn and that we \"designed\" it to be sort of noncommital. You support this by saying there was no progression or gamesolving in my read. That's faulty because I was sure Dunn was scum based off of what I mentioned when I voted him. If I had to sort him, I wouldn't have been pushing for his lynch the whole fucking game. The truth is as carefree as I played this game I was dead on right about scum once and still got no credit for it, instead I got pushed exactly how Dunn wanted me to. And you're still going to lose when I start posting about <span style=\"font-style: italic\">your</span> posts."}

Dunn is quite obviously aware of this because he's not stupid, but he has to create a reason to validate calling Toto scum here so that when he dies, Toto can be sort of cleared. The fact that no one called him out on this at the time including me is pretty bad. The other names he talks about are all town, save for Nos. He half-assedly tries to doubtcast Panther.

When Dunn makes his return, he does not answer this either or interact further. All that happens is a bunch of shit about lynching gerryoat and everyone giving Dunn the benefit of the doubt, much to my disdain. Note that Panther posted a lot on this day and Dunn practically had him pocketed,(a la PocketPunt) which gave the scum team a bit more credibility because Panther is a strong town player and if you manage to mislead him there's not a whole lot of people who will oppose you. Proof is shown in that a lot of people(like Xk) got suckered and defended Dunn.<br><br>None of the townies really talk about Toto. He like slinks into the background while all the chaos is going on. He pops in at #1830 and #1835 to speculate on the setup but does not really comment on most of the other stuff like gerryoat being posed as a possibility. I think it was because he did not want to put himself more in the spotlight when Dunn already has center stage. Nos did the same thing. Dunn and Toto don't speak for the remainder of the day, which reads to me like the interaction they had at the start was simply fleshed out in daychat for that TOWN AESTHETIC but not followed up on strongly. You see, I've hydra'd with Dunn and he tends to put too much faith in his abilities and bobble all over the place.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8439605#p8439605\" class=\"postlink\">post 1959</a>, Toto wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8439567#p8439567\" class=\"postlink\">post 1945</a>, grapes wrote:</cite>@Toto<br>I doubt your reasoning now because I've broken out of my confbias tunnel on dunn for the time being.

BUT what Toto does is attempt to link Grapes and Dunn together with a little dash of Xk. Unlike the \"one of Grapes/Dunn is scum\", this reasoning does not seem sound because there's not really a town basis for it. There's no logical reason to assume as a town member that Grapes and Dunn could even be scum together.

I'm also ok with Zach today.</div></blockquote><br><br><br><br>AND AFTER That, Dunn does not address Toto or attempt to push him, which would be a natural response if Dunn was town and the two weren't on a team. But because Dunn is less likely to die at this point and so the main focus has been shifted to other things, there's really no point in the two engaging each other as strongly anymore.<br><br>Dunn doesn't really appear in force after all this, and then only sometimes to push those who are antagonizing him.<br><br>The key here is that since you can't get a whole lot from Toto by himself, the Dunn activity is pretty telling. Nosferatu is a nonissue because he was about as absent this game as my father when he went to grab cigarettes 23 years ago. Dunno dude, the fact that most of the townies ALSO ignored Toto and a lot supported Dunn tended to shift the momentum of the game in a certain direction. Despite the fact that things fucked up for scum they still had a pretty good game and it is even evident today. I tried to show you here man, but if you find scum based on what people are not doing alone then I cannot change your mind or show you something to counter this because most of my games are filled with noise regardless of what alignment I am. I also did not look at Day 3 yet but I get the feeling here it's largely in vain.</div></div></div>"}

The reason it was a jailkeeper instead of a roleblocker was because if it did get vigged, the people it targeted (as reported by the Archaeologist) would not be cleared just because of the small chance that scum might target their own. I definitely think jailing Zach N2 was an error, especially after Dunn had said he was okay with being vigged."}
