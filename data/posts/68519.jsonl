All <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=6470\" class=\"postlink\">site rules</a> apply.<br>\n2. Be nice. Mafia games can get heated but remember never to attack the person.<br>\n3. Play to your wincon.<br>\n4. Days are approximately 14 days long, nights are approximately 48 hours long. Extensions may be given the circumstances warrant it.<br>\n5. Failure to post at least once every 48 hours will result in a prod. If you do not pick up your prod in 24 hours, or if I have to prod you a fourth time, I will look for a replacement.<br>\n6. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Please</div> put votes in this format: <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Something_Smart</span>. Technically, bolded votes are allowed (<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: Something_Smart</div>), but they are a lot harder to see. It's easier for you and easier for me. In case you don't know, you can vote with:<br>\n<div class=\"codebox\"><p>Code: <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"selectCode(this); return false;\">Select all</a></p><pre><code>[vote]Something_Smart[/vote]</code></pre></div><br>\nand unvote with<br>\n<div class=\"codebox\"><p>Code: <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"selectCode(this); return false;\">Select all</a></p><pre><code>[unvote][/unvote]</code></pre></div><br>\nUnvotes are not necessary to change your vote.<br>\n7. If more than half the players are voting for a player, then that player is lynched and removed from the game, and the day will end. If the deadline is reached before a lynch occurs, the day will end without a lynch.<br>\n8. If you have a question for me, put it in bold and say <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">@Mod</div> or <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">@Something_Smart</div>. If it's not something you want made public, feel free to shoot me a PM.<br>\n9. <div style=\"display:inline;color:#FFBF00\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">This lovely shade of yellow (#FFBF00) is the mod color.</div></div> Do not use it. Do not impersonate me.<br>\n10. Do not discuss this game in any other thread except in PTs created specifically for this game. Do not discuss any other ongoing game in this thread.<br>\n11. Do not quote any out-of-thread communications with me or with any other player.<br>\n12. The day after you are lynched or nightkilled, you may make one \"bah!\" post with no game-related information in it.<br>\n13. Do not pretend to break any of these rules. Pretending to break a rule is punishable just as harshly as actually breaking it.<br>\n14. My word is law. Just because it is not stated here does not mean that it is acceptable. I am generally a nice person and will give you a warning if you do something I don't approve of, but it's always better to ask than risk the consequences (see rule 7).<br>\n15. This game is <div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF0000\">3 mafia-aligned players</div> versus <div style=\"display:inline;color:#00FF00\">10 town-aligned players</div>.<br>\n16. Mafia members may kill and use a personal action in the same night.<br>\n17. The Mafia have unrestricted daytalk in this game.<br>\n18. This game follows the <a href=\"http://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Normal_Game\" class=\"postlink\">Normal Guidelines</a>. At least one player has the following role PM:\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>\nWelcome, XXXX, to Mini 1836: Space Mafia!<br>\n<br>\nYou are a <div style=\"display:inline;color:#00FF00\">Vanilla Townie.</div><br>\nYou have no special abilities.

September 29, 2016: the launching of NASA's newest project, the <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Scumhunter 1</div>, with its revolutionary crew of 13. There was much good cheer and rejoicing.<br>\n<br>\nThe 13 intrepid explorers gathered at the launch pad, said goodbye to their families for a final time, and began to board the spacecraft. As they did, they heard a voice over the radio:<br>\n<br>\nSOMETHING_SMART: This is Something_Smart from Mission Control. We've set everything up just perfectly for you; if you ever have a problem, you come to me. If I'm ever unavailable for some reason, just ask my second-in-command, Aristophanes.<br>\n<br>\nARISTOPHANES: Hey! <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\"><br>\n<br>\nSOMETHING_SMART: Now, you all get buckled in and prepare for liftoff. As one final thing before launch, I'd like to address the rumor that some of you are anarchist spies sent to sabotage the mission. I can assure you that this is nothing you'll have to worry about.<br>\n<br>\n[There is somewhat of a disconcerted muttering among the crew.]<br>\n<br>\nSOMETHING_SMART: But never mind that; prepare for liftoff! 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1...<br>\n<br>\nAs the rockets ignite and the craft begins to accelerate, some of the astronauts begin to ponder nervously what Something_Smart had said.

No way town makes that post. It's obvious he was sharing his thoughts and even VI's (which I didn't get the impression he was) and n00bs (which he probably is) are perfectly capable of doing. He's an easy target for scum to go after.  Then I saw the very next post and that screams scum. Who freaking cares if massive dropped an Rvs vote and didn't comment on anything else.

Not sure why I would ask that, I mean, I explained why I think you are voting me before but I'm not sure how that question would help me get more clarity than that.

I understand the intent of townsfolk asking trick questions to make scum slip but I actually think it's a bad strategy for town at this stage. Scum will eventually slip (logically) because they have no choice. But it is too early in the game for that to work, and I think the strategy is more likely to get us a mislynch at this stage of the game. That is something scum would benefit from so I guess I should read her a bit scummy.

Basically your line; \"They know other players calling them scum are either scum or wrong\" may be true, but you can't tell the difference unless you look into it and not looking into it gives others (like myself) the feeling that you don't care who is green or red.

I'm gonna just rebut your last statement; You should care that Greens are heading towards miss lynching you. I find that Reds are generally more apathetic as well as greens who often get miss lynched. I think this attitude may hurt your game in the long run unless you can build a stable meta (like the one I've been building as town for a few games now.) Still if you do have that kinda stable meta, it may be best to point it out like I generally do second post.

Hi, I'm kinda a strange town player. As both Red and Blue I'm afraid of dying and this influences my posts making them sometimes be more scummy. to counter act this I tend to play very open handed and honestly (unless i'm using PR information or trying to trap scum in which case I come clean as soon as I have the chance) I also like to make read lists every now and then and comment often during the day (staying active) not all my posts will have good content but .. Thats more me being a not strong player :3 This kinda Post I tend to do at the front of my games so.. count this post as an ENTIRE post of NAI but I feel that its important to say so town don't go out there way to lynch me for my normal town play style. If you guys wish you may review my entire history on my wiki page which I update when games close out. Finally I also do LAMIST stuff as I don't wanna die, so if I go around doing that. its normal :3 so with all this said I'm now ready to start properly <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\"></div></blockquote>\ndo you copy paste this in every single game you enter\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8372763#p8372763\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8372763#p8372763\" data-post-id=\"8372763\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 79</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=19768\">Naomi-Tan</a> wrote:</cite>I think while i'm doing stuff I'd like to point 3 things out<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Reds Have Day Talk And May Talk As Much As They Like<br>\nThere Is 3 Red Players and 10 Blues<br>\nMafia Can Use There PR And Take The Shots</div><br>\n<br>\nBut yeah anyone who read the rule thing on page 1 would know this :3 but just pointing it out to avoid any possible confusion.</div></blockquote>\nplease stop\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8373078#p8373078\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8373078#p8373078\" data-post-id=\"8373078\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 99</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=315\">massive</a> wrote:</cite><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: grapes</span><br>\n<br>\nAin't no grapes in space.</div></blockquote>\ndeep.\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8373155#p8373155\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8373155#p8373155\" data-post-id=\"8373155\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 114</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=27717\">Dunnstral</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8373138#p8373138\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8373138#p8373138\" data-post-id=\"8373138\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 112</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=24596\">grapes</a> wrote:</cite>How so?</div></blockquote>\n\nWent from looking like a vi to knowing exactly what they're talking about<br>\n<br>\nThe way they talked was different along with what they were saying</div></blockquote>\n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/7XYz9Fg.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8373193#p8373193\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8373193#p8373193\" data-post-id=\"8373193\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 122</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=28506\">TwoFace</a> wrote:</cite>Vote Dunn or no?<br>\n<br>\nHeads<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">vote: Dunn</div></div></blockquote>\ndear god", "time": "Sat Oct 01, 2016 12:34 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=68519&start=300", "forum": "53", "thread": "68519"}

Given this, it's pretty likely that if you're being lynched, scum is involved, and it's your duty as town to at least find out the arguments to see if they're legit in any way. Cause if they're not, and you say so, not only do you have a chance of someone else realizing it too, and thereby not dying, you also have a good chance of catching scum.<br>\n<br>\nWhy shouldn't you care if someone wants to lynch you?

In my experience, especially with me in particular when I try to disprove arguments against me people, myself included are often ignored, called defensive or dismissive and any counter attacks are disregarded as omgus.

Whereas Grapes here is all over the place, honestly doesn't seem to know what they're doing and seems understandably confused having drawn town. And they don't have the facade.

Zach basically picked a gimmick from the start about going after Dunn and then reacted to a single post visa a vise massive's color thing.

Grapes asked me for an update. so.. here is another read list <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\"><br>\n<br>\nToto<br>\n&lt;Pre-Iso*&gt; Eh... kinda forgot about them<br>\n&lt;Post-Iso*&gt; Ah this guy. yeah I'm getting more Greenish reads off them now, I like there read list and how they took the time to go over the game. There comments seem fair and to be coming from a more !Green focus.<br>\n<br>\nA Simple Plan<br>\n&lt;Pre-Iso*&gt; The guy who's only notable thing was a wall of quotes;<br>\n&lt;Post-Iso*&gt; The guy who made 2 posts so far about 2 days apart I dislike them right now. The long gap between posts makes it hard to get a fix on them as any number of posts may changed there opinion on the game between points A and B. There comments also lack focus only really rail roading me for things I can't really say anything about. I don't wanna Red! read them as its kinda omgusy but its hard not to as there comments keep coming after things have resolved so have little to no risk and he doesn't go deep into those things (taking the one post other than the quote wall as basis for this) I hope this improves. <br>\n<br>\nTwoFace<br>\n&lt;Pre-Iso*&gt; I think he has been pretty good, posting every now and then nothing stand out in either direction. but thats kinda cool with me right now.<br>\n&lt;Post-Iso*&gt; Eeehh.. nothing bad nothing great very middle of the road.. Very Slight greenish? I feel that reds would made more of an effort to push something with his level of post frequency. <br>\n<br>\nitlepip<br>\n&lt;Pre-Iso*&gt; Didn't have any stand out memoryies<br>\n&lt;Post-Iso*&gt; Eh after reading they read pretty Green right now.. they look like they are trying to work out the game and its pretty stable to me.<br>\n<br>\ngrapes<br>\n&lt;Pre-Iso*&gt; I dunno how I feel about them. a little opportunistic could just be brashness.. <br>\n&lt;Post-Iso&gt; I'm still a bit on the fence after my ISO read. there are a few things that I find a little scummy such as the simple plan vote <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8384889#p8384889\">440</a> <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8371163#p8371163\">441 </a> and then on a later post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8385157#p8385157\">486</a> he implys that Simple plan is scummy. I can see him Scum reading me based on how he looked at my stuff though. I'm just thinking its a case of him not playing with me before so.. takes a while for him to switch to understanding how I play. But then there are greenish things like this request for a read list. which was a good idea and something good for the game as it gives more content. So i'm just rather on the fence about  this entire thing.<br>\n<br>\nMariaR<br>\n&lt;Pre-Iso*&gt; Pretty much what I expect out of MariaR will be later in the game where I can work her out.. so yeah<br>\n&lt;Post-Iso&gt; Sigh.. Okay one of my stronger green! reads. MariaR has played with me before and understands sorta how I act/play the game and If she was !red motivated I feel she would be taking what would be a nearly free lynch on her part. The fact she stepped upto the plate to defend me just confirms her Green status to me. as there is no major !Red motivation for doing so.<br>\n<br>\nXkfyu<br>\n&lt;Pre-Iso&gt; Ehh.. I feel like he is taking an easy vote on myself.. but .. its kinda hard to punish him for that... so.. yeah People who havn't played with me, refuse to look at my meta and ignore my self meta tend to get these red flags that he is voting me for.. its a little cheap but I sorta live with that being a thing.<br>\n&lt;Post-Iso&gt; Okay. looking over them I think they are likely a Green! player who is just miss reading myself (partly on the color thing, maybe not taking my meta into account) but thats fine. there iso reads like someone who is taking the time to read and try to understand the game finding things to comment and ask about and generally reading people as they go. So.. Green Leaning.<br>\n<br>\nmassive<br>\n&lt;Pre-Iso&gt; Thinking the colour thing was a genuine Red slip kinda makes me sad inside but I don't really wanna lynch him yet because its such an easy thing to OMGUS I just hope that at some point down the line he will get that I'm Green Aligned and that kinda asorbs most my thoughts on his activities.<br>\n&lt;Post-Iso&gt; I think this MIGHT be his green game... I did play with them recently and it does KINDA feel the same.. but its really hard to tell as I found them suspicious there too.. I guess I just have a hard time grasping massive... But he does seem committed to my lynch and that still is kinda sad.. I guess I gotta null read them.<br>\n<br>\ngerryoat<br>\n&lt;Pre-Iso&gt; Err... struggling to remember any stand out Green or Red moments on this one.. so.. guess not much to put here<br>\n&lt;Post-Iso&gt; Err.. Well this is.. why I forgot him at least..; So he hasn't really spoke much for the first 500 odd posts just kinda lurking with the occasional post.. and then he just kinda goes ape on two-face.. As I'm Green reading Two-face it kinda doens't work with me.. and the huge lurkyness with a lack of reads is also unhealthy... he is either a bad-Green or a Red... but.. he says he is better after day1 so I'd like to give him another day regardless.. I think he would be my lynch pick of the day if he hadn't said that..<br>\n<br>\nDunnstral<br>\n&lt;Pre-Iso&gt; Still think they are probably Green<br>\n&lt;Post-Iso&gt; Wow.. this massive tunnel.. voted Zach page 66 and still on him 600 posts later XD but placing that on the; NAI Pile lets get back to the ISO ... urgh.. Okay.. not so keen on them now :s I think there reactions are just too.. aggressive? like i'm reading this as a player who was hammered (metaphorically speaking) but a Red  player last game so hard that I broke and started ignoring them whenever possible.. and it seems like he is reading both his Red picks mostly on meta, which is cool and all... but at the same time I feel like he ignored the meta for the game we just finished that he modded.. I'm wondering if he read the main thread now.. as I feel that if he was reading along he should of had more of a Green vibe only the color thing standing out, which he ignored anyway. I am curious to know what his thoughts on Red!Maria is in relation to his previous play with them compared to this game though.<br>\n<br>\nThis block is poorly worded.. Sorry town. bit muddled up here.<br>\n<br>\nNosferatu<br>\n&lt;Pre-Iso&gt; I find there play style a little suspicious but For now I'm still giving them the benefit of the doubt. <br>\n&lt;Post-Iso&gt;Bleh.. rather light in stuff... so.. For now.. my fos will stand.

I'm just gonna answer the bottom one. Asking for a read list shows you care and wish to understand how other people think which doesn't have any Red! motivation. As you are trying to work out the game it gives Green Credit. Likewise Toto's read list showed he was trying to work out the game and made him more green. in comparison MariaR's Read list didn't help her as there was no reasons given and I couldn't dig into it.<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8394431#p8394431\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8394431#p8394431\" data-post-id=\"8394431\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 838</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=24596\">grapes</a> wrote:</cite>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8389859#p8389859\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8389859#p8389859\" data-post-id=\"8389859\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 680</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=19768\">Naomi-Tan</a> wrote:</cite>MariaR<br>\n&lt;Pre-Iso*&gt; Pretty much what I expect out of MariaR will be later in the game where I can work her out.. so yeah<br>\n&lt;Post-Iso&gt; Sigh..

MariaR has played with me before and understands sorta how I act/play the game and If she was !red motivated I feel she would be taking what would be a nearly free lynch on her part.

{"number": 896, "id": "8397860", "user": "Naomi-Tan", "user_id": "19768", "content": "okay guys, you remember on my last read list that I said I'm strongest when reading things from a view point of myself? What massive inspired me to do was take a look at the people on my train and try to use that to see who red is. The theory goes as followed;<br>\n<br>\nOkay so for now I'm going to do a bit of roleplay with myself. in this part I'm playing the part of a Red player.<br>\nWe have just started a new game. One of the players is a bit quirky and bubbly might be a gimmick account. Just posted a bunch of NAI Wifom admitting they do lots of things that can be scum read as town. This can be useful. The player just accidentally called town blue instead of green and given their content so far they are not the best player. Looks like an Easy lynch. So I'll vote.<br>\n<br>\nThis Is the example of the red thought pattern going into my train. Seeing a weaker player make what can easily be placed as a red slip they decide to push on it as its a really easy misslynch if they cannot stop people attacking the red slip but then I come out stronger than they expect and by this point most people who started on that train have backed off due to my content and other reasons (im sure everyone has there own) <br>\n<br>\nNow continuing on. Lets have a look at each player on my train at some stage (mostly focusing around the events time nothing for the stuff after right now) We have; <br>\nA Simple Plan <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8376857#p8376857\">282</a><br>\ngrapes <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8384893#p8384893\">441</a><br>\nMassive <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8375060#p8375060\">210</a><br>\nXkfyu <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8375083#p8375083\">211</a><br>\n<br>\nNow Given I'm Green and know I'm green (no matter where you stand on me right now, Just roll with me here) Lets say everything I have said is true and you was a red player? Now some of you would leap at it. its a real free kill that'll have next to no repercussions. Easy to quickly vote and if it turns out there good. no problem unvote till later. Others of you would want to vote but want to have more of a reason than; thats a red slip.. those players would wait till a bit later to post. Now.. I don't believe the entire red team would go in on it. as there are some people who might see it as a bait or just think it's a bit too easy.<br>\n<br>\nI will say however, that I expect at least 1 scum member minamum to take the free kill.. so out of the 4 players I am gonna take an explore and see which one is most likely to be scum.<br>\nStarting with the first;<br>\n<br>\nMassive - He hesitated at first. he was unsure about my slip at first and questioned it. It was only after a misinterpretation that he finally voted and started my bandwagon. Now.. lets look at <br>\n<br>\nGreen!Massive; <br>\nOkay so now I'm going to roleplay as massive!Green.<br>\nThis player just called Town Blue instead of green. I would of missed it, but someone pointed it out to me, (&#10074;&#10074;) Okay So Pausing for a second; If Massive thought this way, it would lead to a more Greenish veiw on Dun; now looking back we can see in; <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8375901#p8375901\">264</a> Just this he is questioning Dunn why he too didn't vote having pointed it out, this makes sense from a Green!Massive Perspective. Moving onwards. (&#9658;) I voted them after pressing the issue and getting what I see as a second scum slip. (see latter half of <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8375060#p8375060\">210</a>) As Naomi couldn't give me a satisfactory explanation I kept my vote on them until bigger threats came about. (&#9632;)  This here follows rather cleanly. You can read the thoughts as it goes and see his confliction on someone he had a town read on suddenly slipping like this.<br>\n<br>\nRed!Massive <br>\nOkay Naomi is acting like she did in our last town game. She should be a NK as she generally is obvious and townie. I'll just town read her. Wait she just slipped.. Well I can't shoot her late game lets push her and tunnel right now. Looks like this lynch won't happen I'll switch to two face. (&#9632;) Okay so... looking at this its pretty okay bar a few things, it doesn't explain why he was questioning dunn and why he didn't vote right away in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8374954#p8374954\">198</a><br>\n<br>\nMassive; Conclusion<br>\nGiven his posts It makes much more sense to have a massive!Green than a Massive!Red as scum he wouldn't feel the need to hesitate partially as he has seen me play before and knows im really strong at making town read me as town. So to make use of a miss step like the one I did he would had to act quickly and that wasn't really evident in his post directly following changing blue to green. <br>\n<br>\nReference List; Massive<br>\nGreen!Massive - <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8375060#p8375060\">210</a> (His vote post) <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8372748#p8372748\">78</a> (My Slip Post) <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8374917#p8374917\">196</a> (Post I started calling town green) <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8372782#p8372782\">81</a> (Dunn pointing it out) <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8375901#p8375901\">264</a> (Him questioning why dun didn't post) <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8371163#p8371163\">770 </a>(Where he voted someone else) <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8371163#p8371163\">194 </a>(His town read on me) <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8374954#p8374954\">198</a> (Him hesitating and questioning if I am scum)<br>\n<br>\nRed!Massive - <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8371163#p8371163\">194 </a>(His town read on me) <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8372748#p8372748\">78</a> (My Slip Post) <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8375060#p8375060\">210</a> (His vote post) <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8371163#p8371163\">770 </a>(Where he voted someone else) <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8374954#p8374954\">198</a> (Him hesitating and questioning if I am scum)<br>\n<br>\nOkay, So next person Xkfyu -they havn't played with me before so is not used to my play style.<br>\n<br>\nGreen!Xkfyu<br>\nOkay this new person has come in with a lamist/NAI post. I don't like self meta and don't really trust it and cba to check her meta. Hmm she seems slightly scummy based on her activities. Oh and Massive pointed out a slip time to vote! eh taking some pressure better make a follow up post explaining why (&#10074;&#10074;) Okay I'm just gonna pause a second as I think its important to note now, that I'm struggling to come up with Green! reasoning going forward from here. but I'll attempt it. (&#9658;) Hmm Well I guess I could mention how I hesitated voting for her before 211... Okay I guess Naomi has been doing stuff... time to switch to someone else. I guess I'll vote Gerryoat (&#9632;) Okay.. So.. the jumps here are kinda big and don't really chain well together but gonna look at this from Red! view and see if that makes less sense<br>\n<br>\nRed!Xkfyu<br>\nOkay this new person has come in with this WIFOM/LAMIST/NAI post. Hmm.. there content is kinda strange and weak. they are doing just what they said looks like a pretty easy day one scapegoat/miss lynch target. I'll scum read them as I'm not sure how good they are later. OH snap! that Blue for Green mix up! this looks like an Easy vote for free!. Votes. Hmm.. looks like they want reasoning.. I'll say its psychology as its hard to argue against. Hmm.. looks like she gave lots of examples of why she could of done it..  but town still seem suspicious i'll just hold. Okay i'm taking a bit of heat. lets just disperse the pressure by saying I don't believe her early post and am scum reading her for those things.. okay. two face seems a little lost lets restate why i'm voting and I guess I can justify not voting right away. Hmm.. this miss lynch isn't happening I'll switch to gerryoak as he is getting a bit of heat(&#9632;) Okay so this chains much neater post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8371163#p8371163\">509 </a> Is still a bit out of place but it fits much smoother.<br>\n<br>\nXkfyu; Conclusion<br>\nSo.. New people who play with me often get this miss impression that I'm an easy miss lynch with my play style having lamist and fear of lynching and other Red flags built in. However, Scum who havn't played with me often make the mistake of seeing me as an easy target early on before I start kicking my major posts like this one out. This mistake is something they often note going on and start backing off. Xkfyu matches this pattern and given some of his posts such as <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8383157#p8383157\">410</a> Its obvious that he didn't check my meta out. This leads me to believe he would not be able to expect me bursting my longer read posts and now this post out on red. His Red! meta matches much better than his Green!meta and it also matches a Red! view on Gerryoat. Someone he barely mentioned suddenly got his vote over someone who 'slipped' in his mind. as Green! there is little to no reason to switch to Oat and I also think his vote switch onto me was more 'sudden' and reactionary than hesitant like he said. In my mind Xkfyu is likely a Red now. <br>\n<br>\nXkfyu Reference List;<br>\nGreen!Xkfyu<br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8371163#p8371163\">78 </a><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8371163#p8371163\">79 </a>(my introduction post he disbelieved) <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8372795#p8372795\">83</a> (proof he understood the post unused in both green and red but thought I'd note it anyway.) <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8371163#p8371163\">185 </a> (when he voices feeling im slightly scummy with no reasons given but used in both red and green) <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8371163#p8371163\">211 </a>(His Vote Post) <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8375203#p8375203\">214</a>(His follow up post giving a short explanation on his vote) <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8371163#p8371163\">409 </a>(him explaining what he meant by psychological)<br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8383157#p8383157\">410</a> (A short follow up restating his reasons for voting me with a more proper and real explanation) <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8371163#p8371163\">417 </a>(an unrelated and unused post of interest that other people might get more out of) <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8387243#p8387243\">509</a> (Mention of this hesitance and his reason again) <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8391357#p8391357\">768</a> (his vote switch to Gerryoat)<br>\n<br>\nRed!Xkfyu<br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8371163#p8371163\">78 </a><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8371163#p8371163\">79 </a>(my introduction post he disbelieved) <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8372795#p8372795\">83</a> (proof he understood the post unused in both green and red but thought I'd note it anyway.)

(&#9632;) Not much to work with here. Kinda follows a chain of thought might be confirm bias? eh.. Onto red veiw<br>\n<br>\nRed!A Simple Plan<br>\nOkay I been lurking a while, better give some reads quickly.. oh ha a town member just made a grand fuck up okay Free lynch lets do this. Votes. Hmm.. Naomi's train is losing momentum I know she said a post about the stuff she posts but lets make a scummy post collection and see if I can get this moving again. (&#9632;) Well once again logical red train<br>\n<br>\nA Simple Plan; Conclusion<br>\nInconclusive; I find that the Red thoughts and Green thoughts are about equally as likely. I think the second post he did is more likely to be scum motivated but with so little to go on there is no way to easily cut this so its kinda a null result leaning on scumish. but without more information it would be impossible to tell and after this post too easy to forge.<br>\n<br>\nA Simple Plan; Refrences<br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8376857#p8376857\">282</a> <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8384703#p8384703\">438</a><br>\n<br>\nOkay last person Grapes - Much later onto the train he joined around A Simple Plans prod So lets go. No puns intended on the following area<br>\n<br>\nGreen!Grapes <br>\nOkay. So.. A rookie player sorta slipped with the color thing.. but thats mostly NAI. But that read list is a bit meh and that null vote is way too safe. Okay.. I see a quote wall with a lot of scummy things.. Yeah you know what I'll vote. Hmm.. Naomi isn't really doing anything too scummy.. while dunn is been pushing softly for a while and shading. lets switch over. (&#9632;) This follows a clear logical path I partially like the double post hesitation before finally voting me. I would think Red! players would just vote on that right away and changing to dunn is MUCH cleaner than X's movements off me.<br>\n<br>\nRed!Grapes Okay So a rookie player made a colour mess up. too easy I'll say I'm not town reading her for that while still saying I'm scum reading her. Hmm another player made a post with a bunch of reasons to vote naomi lets jump on that train. Hmm.. this isn't going anywhere but dunn is about to pick up so lets jump there (&#9632;) This on the other hand makes kinda big leaps in logic and doens't path too well..<br>\n<br>\nGrapes Conclusion; <br>\nGiven there actions It seems far more likely that Grapes is Green aligned rather than Red aligned if he was a red player he could of gone onto me when I did the slip and read list citing his dislike of it. with multiple players on it at that time it would of also made sense and helped build momentum but waiting until later and hesitating is much more a Green move like he couldn't choose if I was Red or Green but was convinced by a simple plan. <br>\n<br>\nGrapes References;<br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8371163#p8371163\">293 </a>(where he says he didn't think I scum slipped but thinks im scummy for my read list) <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8371163#p8371163\">440 </a>(His reaction to ASP's post part 1) <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8371163#p8371163\">441 </a>(His reaction to ASP's post part 2) <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8394627#p8394627\">856</a> (his dun vote) <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8371163#p8371163\">860 </a>(Some of his dun reasons; there are many reasons why scattered before this vote too it wasn't a sudden jump, for more Grapes thinking dun is suspicious posts please iso grapes there are a bunch of them)<br>\n<br>\nFinal Conclusion<br>\nOver all I think that Massive and Grapes was Green on my train. given the reasons above and there reactions.

She's only doing it to the best of her ability.

No one apparently sees how scummy Massive is, that TwoFace/gerryoat debate was either largely useless or elaborate scum theatre(unlikely, I like TwoFace),no one really pays attention to people like Xkfyu and Toto who just POP in and POP out, Naomi is still blatant town and people are still trying to read her, Dunn garners towncred by existing apparently no matter how scummy he is, in fact itlepip has given him an obligatory defense, and Nosferatu disappeared like my dad when he went to go get cigarettes 20 years ago.<br>\n<br>\nNo one gives a shit about this tho, but Zach is scum.

I Know meta can change and all but from what I've seen Grapes as scum knows how to get people to relax around them in a way, and they look like they're scumhunting and helping town. Whereas Grapes here is all over the place, honestly doesn't seem to know what they're doing and seems understandably confused having drawn town. And they don't have the facade.

I was opening under the assumption that if Dunn was town, you were probably lying. The idea of both sides having a blocking role wasn't in my realm of possibility yet.(that came later once more claims came out). <br>\n<br>\nI was trying to determine if scum would block and kill the same person and that scenario made no sense. <br>\n<br>\nDunn being the scum roleblocker came in because again I knew that pip was blocked and nobody had any idea we were working with dual blocking roles. I was trying to figure out if mafia would block and kill pip because I never in a million years would have thought town RB would have blocked pip. We were also discussing the RB being scum who blocked town Dunn which is why the talk was about mafia RB. <br>\n<br>\nI pushed you as scum now because you were trying to discredit me when I've helped town out more than anyone else.

At least that's how I remember it.<br>\n<br>\nHe was in the same category of (Nos, massive, Xkfyu) for me because of how background he was. If he was not background then he went relatively unnoticed.<br>\n<br>\nAlso I don't see how looking at partner interactions is the most valuable here. Dunn talks to literally everyone.

He never did any serious attempt to actually question me. To solve the game. Notice the difference how you and grapes reacted to me when you thought I was scum.

All he does is pollute the thread with filler posts, and make half-arsed pushes that makes him look like he is doing something but when you look closely there is no real bone behind it. He doesn't expose his neck. His reads never adapt based on new information because they are not real reads, and there is no new information for him because he is mafia.<br>\n<br>\nLook at his behavior in the last 3 days.

I never scumread him. He played different from the other game I was in with him where he was also scum<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nYa my ISO screams scum.. like that was the goal for a scum player. You are just pandering to TwoFace trying to get this win handed to you.<br>\n<br>\nI'm pretty sure JKing me was Dunn's final refuge. I doubt he planned for things to play out as they did but it still benefits him and it does even more in terms of people seeing me as scum. You and Nosferatu were more to the side but was the central player in the team. He just drew too much attention to himself which will inevitably be why you lose here. I know him, his personality is too loud and if he does not have scumpartners that can make him not seem as overt he will probably not be very compatible with them.<br>\n<br>\nIf you look at Dunn's ISO it looks like he played a really shitty game but it seemed deliberate. Dunn always tunnels me so I wouldn't have scumread him for doing that. A few  on this player list are familiar with him so I doubt they would have either. It probably was a subterfuge to coast and his contigency plan was to JK me. I presume that's why I was kept alive, because almost no one save for grapes agreed with me fully and if I was kept alive there would be no credence to Dunn being scum in the town's eye because the guy who was presumably the loudest threat to him was kept alive. I'm pretty sure I only agreed with TwoFace about massive at the time. Toto has yet to show where I've sheeped anything. You just said a bunch of shit that I did and next to it put your own explanations to support your agenda. This is different from those posts actually supporting your agenda because you're making up an entirely new intention for them.<br>\n<br>\nYou said I bussed Dunn and that we \"designed\" it to be sort of noncommital. You support this by saying there was no progression or gamesolving in my read. That's faulty because I was sure Dunn was scum based off of what I mentioned when I voted him. If I had to sort him, I wouldn't have been pushing for his lynch the whole fucking game. The truth is as carefree as I played this game I was dead on right about scum once and still got no credit for it, instead I got pushed exactly how Dunn wanted me to.

No one apparently sees how scummy Massive is, that TwoFace/gerryoat debate was either largely useless or elaborate scum theatre(unlikely, I like TwoFace),no one really pays attention to people like Xkfyu and Toto who just POP in and POP out, Naomi is still blatant town and people are still trying to read her, Dunn garners towncred by existing apparently no matter how scummy he is, in fact itlepip has given him an obligatory defense, and Nosferatu disappeared like my dad when he went to go get cigarettes 20 years ago.<br>\n<br>\nNo one gives a shit about this tho, but Zach is scum. Okay. Zach is supposed to will forth the energy to dispel this bullshit, but he cannot.\n</div></blockquote>\n\nyea twoface i just rolled scum and put my feet up on my keyboard this game<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nyou act  like I didn't push massive. maybe I didn't state it a lot but you were there and you yourself SAW how massive acted with naomi's color slip stuff. it was bullshit and that was like the main driving force for that push. it looked like he was trying to set up the easiest mislynch. You're also soley looking at my offense and not even mentioning my stances on major things in the game like the Naomi wagon or player interactions. I cannot win if you only see things one way so just vote now because I doubt it will make much of a difference if you wait and then continue to.. reinforce what you already believe<br>\n<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Toto wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8373821#p8373821\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8373821#p8373821\" data-post-id=\"8373821\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 165</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=28566\">Toto</a> wrote:</cite>@Dunn, why do you think Grapes is town?</div></blockquote>\nYou ask them important questions.</div></blockquote>\n\nAre you trying to imply you're not Dunn's teammate here?<br>\n<br>\nit might actually work", "time": "Tue Nov 15, 2016 10:47 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=68519&start=3375", "forum": "53", "thread": "68519"}

But it's really stupid distancing that gives him away because in the situation that we had (Dunn fake claiming a visit on grapes) where no one knows that Dunn is lying yet, a fair and probably the most standard town rationale would be to say that one of the two are lying. It's basic common sense. Dunn is quite obviously aware of this because he's not stupid, but he has to create a reason to validate calling Toto scum here so that when he dies, Toto can be sort of cleared. The fact that no one called him out on this at the time including me is pretty bad. The other names he talks about are all town, save for Nos. He half-assedly tries to doubtcast Panther. Nosferatu's name is literally only tossed in here for funsies.<br>\n<br>\nSure enough, the conversation with the two begins to get sort of to the point where the bus may become unsustainable because it will attract attention that will put both of the scum players in peril.<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8425885#p8425885\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8425885#p8425885\" data-post-id=\"8425885\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 1563</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=28566\">Toto</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8425763#p8425763\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8425763#p8425763\" data-post-id=\"8425763\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 1558</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=27717\">Dunnstral</a> wrote:</cite>Toto is scum for sure in a scenario where Grapes is town.

When Dunn makes his return, he does not answer this either or interact further. All that happens is a bunch of shit about lynching gerryoat and everyone giving Dunn the benefit of the doubt, much to my disdain. Note that Panther posted a lot on this day and Dunn practically had him pocketed,(a la PocketPunt) which gave the scum team a bit more credibility because Panther is a strong town player and if you manage to mislead him there's not a whole lot of people who will oppose you. Proof is shown in that a lot of people(like Xk) got suckered and defended Dunn.<br>\n<br>\nNone of the townies really talk about Toto. He like slinks into the background while all the chaos is going on. He pops in at #1830 and #1835 to speculate on the setup but does not really comment on most of the other stuff like gerryoat being posed as a possibility. I think it was because he did not want to put himself more in the spotlight when Dunn already has center stage. Nos did the same thing. Dunn and Toto don't speak for the remainder of the day, which reads to me like the interaction they had at the start was simply fleshed out in daychat for that TOWN AESTHETIC but not followed up on strongly. You see, I've hydra'd with Dunn and he tends to put too much faith in his abilities and bobble all over the place.<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8439605#p8439605\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8439605#p8439605\" data-post-id=\"8439605\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 1959</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=28566\">Toto</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8439567#p8439567\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8439567#p8439567\" data-post-id=\"8439567\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 1945</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=24596\">grapes</a> wrote:</cite>@Toto<br>\nI doubt your reasoning now because I've broken out of my confbias tunnel on dunn for the time being.

It is very likely you would end up lynched today. So trade here means you still lose 1 scum, but the other one gets some significant towncred.

But because Dunn is less likely to die at this point and so the main focus has been shifted to other things, there's really no point in the two engaging each other as strongly anymore.<br>\n<br>\nDunn doesn't really appear in force after all this, and then only sometimes to push those who are antagonizing him.<br>\n<br>\nThe key here is that since you can't get a whole lot from Toto by himself, the Dunn activity is pretty telling. Nosferatu is a nonissue because he was about as absent this game as my father when he went to grab cigarettes 23 years ago. Dunno dude, the fact that most of the townies ALSO ignored Toto and a lot supported Dunn tended to shift the momentum of the game in a certain direction. Despite the fact that things fucked up for scum they still had a pretty good game and it is even evident today. I tried to show you here man, but if you find scum based on what people are not doing alone then I cannot change your mind or show you something to counter this because most of my games are filled with noise regardless of what alignment I am. I also did not look at Day 3 yet but I get the feeling here it's largely in vain.</div></div></div>", "time": "Thu Nov 17, 2016 7:54 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=68519&start=3400", "forum": "53", "thread": "68519"}
