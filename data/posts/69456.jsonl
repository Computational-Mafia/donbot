All rules from <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=4&amp;t=6470\" class=\"postlink\">this post</a> apply here too.<br>2. Don't directly quote any game-related PMs I've sent you. Paraphrasing is OK.<br>3. Don't intentionally obfuscate your messages; cryptography, tiny text, and the like are not allowed.<br>4. Provable randomness, such as dice tags, is banned.<br>5. Treat your fellow users with respect. As a cool guy on this site once said, \"Attack the play, not the player.\"<br>6. Don't pretend to be the mod. Green is my color. Please don't use it. Specifically [color=#00BF00]#00BF00 and <span style=\"color: #008000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">#008000</span></span><br>7. Each in-game day will last 14 days and each in-game night will last two days.<br>8.  I will prod players that haven't posted with game-advancing content for 48 hours. If a player is prodded and doesn't post within 24 hours of the prod, I will look for a replacement for that slot. I will replace a player if the player receives three prods. If you're in V/LA, you are exempt from the above rules for the duration of your V/LA. You must announce the V/LA either in-thread or in a PM to me.<br>9. If more than half of the live players vote for another player, they are lynched and removed from the game. After a lynching, all living players may post until the thread is locked: this time is called Twilight.<br>10. I will count votes if they are placed by the vote tag or in bold, and are recognizable as votes. Don't abuse this rule for trickery. Examples of these votes:<br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: eagerSnake</span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: eagerSnake</span><br>11. If a player wants to end the day without a lynching, they may vote for \"No Lynch.\" If a majority votes for No Lynch, the night will start early. If there is no majority vote by the deadline, no lynch will take place that Day.<br>12. Every player will have a Role, dictating what they can do during the night, if anything. Here's a sample PM for the role \"Vanilla Townie.\"<br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Hello!<br><br>You are a <span style=\"color: #008000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Vanilla Townie</span></span>.<br><br>Your powers include your voice and your vote! Use them well.<br><br>You win the game when all threats to the Town have been eliminated.<br><br>Confirm your role by replying to me with your Role and Alignment.<br><br>Good luck!<br><br>Game Thread</div></blockquote><br>13. Players with roles and factional abilities, if any, can only choose one to use each night.<br>14. If you die, you are allowed one \"Bah\" post. You may not say anything game-related in it.<br>15. If you have any questions about these rules, PM me and I'll answer them. <br>And last but not least, don't forget to have fun!"}

Mafia isn't a science anyways.  It's a psychological game with lots of manipulation.  You really think those great players you mention can't/don't manipulate their meta?  Look at GerryOats doing it.

You wouldn't keep your eye on me if Keyan flipped town?  Really?  Only scum know alignments, so if i were scum, wouldn't it make sense for me to not defend my scum buddy, but defend a townie wagon?  I think that's common sense.  What I don't like is you trying to pair me with Keyan for no reason other than me asking why the Keyan wagon got so large without any reasoning behind it.  You don't seem to like that though.  Why?  You don't like bad wagons explained?  There are plenty of things to vote Keyan for that were no apparent at that point in the game.  That means those votes need explanations.<br><br>Also, you're not aggressive, just abrasive.  There's a difference.  You haven't added anything to the conversation that justifies it though."}

You wouldn't keep your eye on me if Keyan flipped town?  Really?  Only scum know alignments, so if i were scum, wouldn't it make sense for me to not defend my scum buddy, but defend a townie wagon?  I think that's common sense.  What I don't like is you trying to pair me with Keyan for no reason other than me asking why the Keyan wagon got so large without any reasoning behind it.  You don't seem to like that though.  Why?  You don't like bad wagons explained?  There are plenty of things to vote Keyan for that were no apparent at that point in the game.  That means those votes need explanations.<br><br>Also, you're not aggressive, just abrasive.  There's a difference.

Well sorry I disagree which is why I said what I said. <br><br>Also there is no black and white with regards to what scum will do to their buddies. Some people bus, others don't. Early day 1 if a scum buddy gets into trouble it's a tough decision on what's the best way to handle it and I could totally see you as a buddy attempt to discredit the votes like you did. It's the type of defense that can be written off as a cautious townie.(for example,  in the game I just finished where scum got lynched fairly early day 1, one scum flat out called the guy town.) There's no one absolute way to handle a partner getting run up. <br><br>I'm also not concerned with what you like. I call things as I see them. If that makes somebody upset/nervous/etc that's not my problem. <br><br>Also I'm not trying to pair you with anyone. You're the second person to make that mistake. Keeping an eye on somebody doesn't mean I automatically think they are scum. It just means I'll have to reread their posts to see if they make sense as a buddy. That post you made just struck me as odd."}

I think that's common sense.  What I don't like is you trying to pair me with Keyan for no reason other than me asking why the Keyan wagon got so large without any reasoning behind it.  You don't seem to like that though.  Why?  You don't like bad wagons explained?  There are plenty of things to vote Keyan for that were no apparent at that point in the game.

Well sorry I disagree which is why I said what I said. <br><br>Also there is no black and white with regards to what scum will do to their buddies. Some people bus, others don't. Early day 1 if a scum buddy gets into trouble it's a tough decision on what's the best way to handle it and I could totally see you as a buddy attempt to discredit the votes like you did. It's the type of defense that can be written off as a cautious townie.(for example,  in the game I just finished where scum got lynched fairly early day 1, one scum flat out called the guy town.) There's no one absolute way to handle a partner getting run up. <br><br>I'm also not concerned with what you like. I call things as I see them. If that makes somebody upset/nervous/etc that's not my problem. <br><br>Also I'm not trying to pair you with anyone. You're the second person to make that mistake.

I also don't like him putting me in as his essentially only town-read in that huge read list he posted.  I was at the top.  I question the wagon and he jumps on me as being super town, while Two Face jumps as if it connects me to Keyan.  Both extreme reactions seem contrived to me.  <br><br>Psychodave has been given excuses for his supposed 'fast environment' as to why he posts fluff and/or scummy things.  He hasn't answered any questions posed to him, and for some reason, nobody has truly jumped on him with votes the way they have with Keyan.  Only a select few have questioned Dave or his motives at all.  That makes me suspicious.  Also, where is TwoFace giving his pairing if Dave flips scum?  I forgot which person it was that explained Dave away as 'fast paced environment' so I'll have to go back and find it, but I'm on my phone so it will take another post to do it.  Regardless, TwoFace should be pairing those two as well if he holds to his current reasoning.  Why hasn't this happened?<br><br>Gamma seems to vote randomly and gives little weight to them.  I questioned Rask's motivations about Lil Uzi, and gamma votes Lil Uzi right after.  I didn't get why, and it looked odd.  Then Rask questions gamma about his casual play, so gamma does a literal 3 minute ISO (supposedly) and changes votes.  Again, I don't see any real reason for it and there's no weight with the vote.  It seems to go on whomever seems easy at the time, but it doesn't look like Gamma legitimately believes they're voting scum in any instance.<br><br>All the mentions of TwoFace above lead me to mention a possible OMGUS read (on my part) on TwoFace. Mainly it's due to him trying to pair me with Keyan for questioning the early vote reasons on him.  He then says if Keyan flips town, he's not going to watch me anymore.  That doesn't seem like a townie statement.  Townie TwoFace should watch everyone regardless.  Whatever Keyan flips wouldn't make me more/less town.  What's the goal with the pairing statement?  He claims he isn't telling anyone else what to do after the fact, but told 'town' to watch me in his original post.  It seems like he's flip flopping his stance based on whether he gets questioned on it or not.  He also gets very defensive/abrasive about it too, which seems odd to me.  This may all be OMGUS/conf bias on my part though.  I'll let everyone else decide.  Regardless, I find his overall play to be scummy, although maybe he just likes being an Internet tough guy.  It's hard to tell RN."}

I no longer think he's scummy since my read was based on something I misunderstood now that it's been shown to me who \"him\" was referring to. I never said Dave is not scummy. I think he's been really inactive and people who are scumreading him seem to be doing so for post 63.

It seems like a stretch to say that Tywin and Keyen are twisting the truth because it looks pretty easy to interpret your posts the way they seem to be doing. Putting you three together in iso doesn't really show me anything right away either so again I'll need to take notes to figure out what I think of the fight going on between Tywin/TwoFace. Both of you look pretty earnest though so that makes me lean towards this being TvT, keeping any other information aside."}

You act like a victim and cried wolf already by saying Keyan broke site rules due to calling your play 'bad' and now you call me a liar by ignoring actual posts in the game.  It's ridiculous.  Either you're completely blind, completely filled with ego to a point where you can't accept when you're wrong, are scum and being manipulative (and doing badly at it), or all of the above.

A very strange position for town to take, and then specifically the series of events where you started as questioning the tywin scumread by gamma, then asked gamma why he isn't voting him which got him to do so, and then when he did vote you voted as well on a sheep. As opposed to, you know, just forming your own read on tywin and thinking for yourself whether to vote or not. The gist of your wagon, \"I don't see how this can be a legitimate town perspective\", is a very common justification for votes and scumhunting, whether your \"theory\" says it's a good or bad approach.<br><br>Your stances if town, true or false are still quite bizarre or at the very least at odds with the norm, so combined with you being \"used to\" this I question how you can be unaware of that and so quick to cast judgement as a result."}

I think it's fairly normal for one to want to step back and take a look at the whole picture again regardless of new information. The analogies didn't help much at all since you can always sample food before tasting the whole thing. A better case or reasoning would've been why he felt the need to rush out reads when the game was still young and no one prompted him too. <br><br>I'm not sure if the latter is a personality thing or scum who was desperate to establish himself early. Gamma's always is  a difficult read for me but that's mainly my fault since for some reason I always seem to not pay attention to him whenever we play. <br><br>I think Tywin's issue with TF wanting to keep on eye on him is that he probably feels he hasn't done anything worthy of being seriously scum read at all. I can relate to that a lot and based on his join date I think it's a fair assessment of the interactions between those two. Really don't think there's anything there other than personalities clashing. <br><br>I liked Key's big response to the pressure in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8592077#p8592077\">371</a>. Explained his actions and thoughts fairly well and while I don't  agree with his view on TF's willingness to vote him, his tone just feels town. Still not really understanding any of his reads at all but hey, most people don't understand mine in general half the time so I'm just going to work harder to understand them. <br><br>My vote is going to go to Grey though. Been keeping an eye on this guy from the start, everything from his entrance to his demeanor gives me the chills. There is no way that Grey didn't know who Gamma was before this game. Someone who has never played with a person or doesn't know their meta doesn't say \"It's Gamma.\" They're a more likely to say that's \"newb town\" or that's \"NAI\". Identifying with play style also doesn't justify that response. Even if he's telling the truth, that is not a reason to TR Gamma. I can identify with at least 3-4 people's play style this game but I'll be fool to TR them just solely on that. This tells me one thing and is that he doesn't have any real reads and he's just voting anyone that's a threat to him which is a big no in my book. <br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Grey</span></div></div></div>"}

Dave feels like lynchbait (or at worst unskilled scum) to me and doesn't have team associations with other players within this pool in the way that most of these players do. Dave's a better target for a vig shot than a lynch right now imo. I've seen Keyen/Gear/Vij, and Keyen/Grey, but haven't noticed Grey/Gear or Grey/Vij yet. I didn't notice Gamma teamtelling with any of them yet so I'm less inclined to lynch him despite liking the case on him (to the point I've analyzed at least).

Absolutely everyone has been more than adamant/willing to lynch him without question.  Not a single person besides me has really even questioned it, and I know I'm town.  That means scum most likely are all aboard the Keyen wagon, and that's where it makes me not like it.  Keyen just seems like the 'easiest' option, but that doesn't make him town or scum.  Regardless, scum love easy lynches that nobody questions.  It gives no information if Keyen flips town, because absolutely all of you were eager to join his wagon.  <br><br>So I really want to hear what the case is on Keyen, and I hope the rest of you question the votes on him as well and pressure everyone to explain their reasons before he (probably) inevitably gets lynched.  If he does flip town, then I want something useful out of it.  At the moment, scum can just play 'everyone was on it!' and have zero explaining or suspicion."}

You don't state an actual stance, you just give an anecdote.</div></blockquote><br><br>Shade throwing?  It's just a story.  I don't have an actual stance on whether grey is fake claiming or not.  It frankly doesn't matter rn anyway.  I just was reminded of when I claimed bodyguard in a past game while not town-aligned.  It is relevant in that I believe bodyguard is an easy claim to fake, but I'm not trying to get grey lynched right now.  <br><br>What is odd to me is that you look at my story, one I didn't have to bring up at all, and again you claim it to somehow be AI.  You did the same when I pointed out that TwoFace lied.  Funny enough, I believe Kyou came and proved it again after the fight was over.  You took that opportunity to vote me for literally proving TwoFace lied about something.  That was your scum read. It seemed awfully fishy and still does.<br><br>What I find extremely interesting is if grey is indeed a bodyguard, then you as scum of course would love him sheeping you.  You also clearly let him lead you to a vote on me without any pushback.  You didn't even question it or provide a reason why.  That's awesome for scum Gamma, because you'd have an out on why you tried to lynch a townie (me) by being led by another townie (grey).  Aside from that, when I asked you if it bothered you that grey was attaching himself to you, you clearly stated that no, you were very happy to have him do that.

Dave, on the other hand, is just posting one sentence. <br><br>So if yall would like to lynch me because I'm an easy lynch, think about it more. Who's more the easiest lynch: Me or Dave? The reason I'm asking this is even though I'm not posting some content-worthy post, but still I'm trying to communicate and help town whilst Dave is actually admitting he's dumb town. So yall would like to remain Dave, who could be just a newbtown who's posting non sense, and if LyLo comes, he'll say: \"I think X is scummy so Vote X\" but Y is the real scum. So yeah, so much for the newbtown to let win the game. <br><br>I don't care if this post itself is scummy, but think about it.

Interesting story there Tywin.<br>...by which I mean that's pretty scummy.</div></blockquote><br><br>How is it scummy?  Lol, you can't throw around the word to fit whatever you want.  I'm sharing a story, and you consider that scummy?  Okay then.  Enjoy your bad reads.  You'll find out eventually one way or another.</div></blockquote><br>It looks like shade throwing. You don't state an actual stance, you just give an anecdote.</div></blockquote><br><br>Shade throwing?  It's just a story.  I don't have an actual stance on whether grey is fake claiming or not.  It frankly doesn't matter rn anyway.  I just was reminded of when I claimed bodyguard in a past game while not town-aligned.  It is relevant in that I believe bodyguard is an easy claim to fake, but I'm not trying to get grey lynched right now.  <br><br>What is odd to me is that you look at my story, one I didn't have to bring up at all, and again you claim it to somehow be AI.  You did the same when I pointed out that TwoFace lied.  Funny enough, I believe Kyou came and proved it again after the fight was over.  You took that opportunity to vote me for literally proving TwoFace lied about something.  That was your scum read. It seemed awfully fishy and still does.<br><br>What I find extremely interesting is if grey is indeed a bodyguard, then you as scum of course would love him sheeping you.  You also clearly let him lead you to a vote on me without any pushback.  You didn't even question it or provide a reason why.  That's awesome for scum Gamma, because you'd have an out on why you tried to lynch a townie (me) by being led by another townie (grey).  Aside from that, when I asked you if it bothered you that grey was attaching himself to you, you clearly stated that no, you were very happy to have him do that.  That's definitely something scum would love, but a skeptical townie would not.<br><br>Aside from that, no votes from you have ever had any conviction or real reason behind them.  You've vote switched a ton of times, and every vote was useless in that you had no reasoning behind it.  You weren't pushing for any lynches, and you aren't scum hunting whatsoever.  You've only thrown doubt on other players, but do not ask questions in any attempt to find scum.  Why?  Is it because you already know they're all town?<br><br>I find that if grey isn't scum, the probability of you being scum is much, much higher.</div></blockquote><br><br>Pinged</div></blockquote><br>what is this"}

It aligns with my general reads so far.  I've been suspicious of Gamma for a while now.  I haven't been paying much attention to gear, but I don't have a town read on him from what I have seen.  Idk about grey anymore after the claim, but i don't think it matters right now.  If he's scum, then he will get lynched eventually regardless.  That may be why he lost interest and wants out.  It isn't like he has much chance to survive RN regardless of alignment.<br><br>As for the rest in that second tier, I largely have neutral reads on most of them.  I've gotten more townie vibes from lil Uzi than anything, but it isn't nearly as strong as I do from Jar Jar, Rask, and TF.  I've also gotten them from Kyou.<br><br><br>Now that I see key's post 222 again, I like it even less.  I'm the only 'real town' read he has, which probably came from questioning his wagon.  I don't like Gamma in the 'leaning town' read.  I don't have a real read on vij yet (need to ISO him, gear, and key I think), and my townie read of Kyou may be due to the 'Tywin was right about TF' post, so it's inherently biased on my part. <br><br>I really don't like Rask/TF in the 'leaning scum' section.  I find myself nodding my head at the majority of Rask's posts this game, and while I disagree with TF on semantics here and there, he reads as an aggressive town.  I can't say I've never played/posted the way he has, and I've always done it as town.  Scum just play more careful in my experience, while town with nothing to lose are usually the hyper-aggressive ones like TF is playing.  Dave is whatever to me.  Now that I see people post key's quotes (plus JJD's perspective on key's wagon/possible scbuddies), I can see how key is the scummier player.  <br><br>Idk about Gear in the 'definite scum' list, but I really don't like JJD there.  His posts have been townie and have largely moved the game forward.  At the least, they're far more helpful to town than any combination of key/gear/Dave/Gamma/grey.<br><br><br>Sorry for wall, but basically, I'm okay with a key lynch, especially after his latest posts.  He really hasn't scum hunted as TF pointed out, and mainly it's been a lot of whining/flailing (no offense key).  My main concern was the early wagon gaining traction so quickly, but I agree with JJD's points in how I could be looking at it wrong.  If I dismiss that one concern, key does look like flailing scum.  There aren't any real pro-town posts from him as far as I've seen.</div></div></div><br><br>Tl;dr:  I like Rask's scum list.  I really dislike key's post 222 read list.  I agree with the points JJD/TF have recently made.  Probably will vote key after I reread a few players I've not been paying much attention to, key included.  My top townies agree that key is probable scum, and I don't disagree with that perspective anymore.  I'm not 100% sold, but if we won't be lynching Gamma, I'll go with key.  Would prefer Gamma though, at least at this juncture."}

Pages 20-21 show Gamma questioning -grey- on basically calling him conf town.  -grey-'s response is 'I identify with his playstyle, so I'm sheeping the town read.'  <br><br>My thought is they can't both be scum, since that would be bad play IMO, and I don't see either as bad players.  Gamma may well be town, and scum -grey- knew it, so it explains how he's so confident in that town read.  Grey led Gamma to vote me at the time (more or less), then hopped on right after.  I know I'm town, so grey pushing for Gamma to vote me would make sense from scum's perspective.  Him 'sheeping' a townie lynch would possibly clear him and implicate Gamma at the same time.  The only reason it didn't work was due to questioning by Rask/Gerry/etc.  grey couldn't legitimately explain either why he was so confident in his town read of Gamma or why he thought I was scum.  After he got called out and voted, he claimed bodyguard and then asks for replacement.  <br><br>So I may need to rethink the Gamma read.  Doesn't really matter today, but it will be worth investigating after the key lynch.  <br><br>Due to that, I think my scum list remains at key/gear/vij with grey/gamma thrown in there somewhere."}

You don't state an actual stance, you just give an anecdote.</div></blockquote><br><br>Shade throwing?  It's just a story.  I don't have an actual stance on whether grey is fake claiming or not.  It frankly doesn't matter rn anyway.  I just was reminded of when I claimed bodyguard in a past game while not town-aligned.  It is relevant in that I believe bodyguard is an easy claim to fake, but I'm not trying to get grey lynched right now.  <br><br>What is odd to me is that you look at my story, one I didn't have to bring up at all, and again you claim it to somehow be AI.  You did the same when I pointed out that TwoFace lied.  Funny enough, I believe Kyou came and proved it again after the fight was over.  You took that opportunity to vote me for literally proving TwoFace lied about something.  That was your scum read. It seemed awfully fishy and still does.<br><br>What I find extremely interesting is if grey is indeed a bodyguard, then you as scum of course would love him sheeping you.  You also clearly let him lead you to a vote on me without any pushback.  You didn't even question it or provide a reason why.  That's awesome for scum Gamma, because you'd have an out on why you tried to lynch a townie (me) by being led by another townie (grey).  Aside from that, when I asked you if it bothered you that grey was attaching himself to you, you clearly stated that no, you were very happy to have him do that.  That's definitely something scum would love, but a skeptical townie would not.<br><br>Aside from that, no votes from you have ever had any conviction or real reason behind them.  You've vote switched a ton of times, and every vote was useless in that you had no reasoning behind it.  You weren't pushing for any lynches, and you aren't scum hunting whatsoever.  You've only thrown doubt on other players, but do not ask questions in any attempt to find scum.  Why?  Is it because you already know they're all town?<br><br>I find that if grey isn't scum, the probability of you being scum is much, much higher.</div></blockquote><br><br>Pinged</div></blockquote><br>Bump.

He's been your only lynch target at all, and it's always been just 'Dave is worse.'  It doesn't explain why, and you don't even claim to think he's scum.  You're just wanting it to be anyone but you.  While I understand that, you aren't giving any real scum reads.  You're ignoring a lot of players and call the most town ones scum.  Even after all that, you continue to say Dave, even though you've never actually called him scum like you have me, Rask, JJD, etc."}

I figured he'd stick around at least to write another post, but apparently not if he already logged. <br><br>The few players I can think of that had objections to this wagon was Gerryoats, vij maybe, you somewhat.  Gerry posted earlier throwing shade on me for switching my stance on Keyen, but didn't exactly give another target.  He's still all for the Dave wagon, which isn't going to happen today.  Key wants Dave too, but only due to it being someone other than him, not due to a scum read.  Vij asked for replacement as far as I know, so unless you can think of anyone that's against the key wagon, I see no reason to wait now."}

And people don't just skip 20 pages and then come back without any content to add but \"what are the votes at\" <br><br>3rd: I didn't scumread key, because he had reactions that I have when I'm scumread as town.

I suspect him the most.  All of the lines in his ISO that I find suspect are highlighted in red or just black.<br><br>In short...I suspect TwoFace for tunneling keyen all D1 despite acknowledging that his vote on keyen was opportunistic and that his case on him was weak.  That there were no better alternatives to keyen despite a solid effort by JJD towards Gamma; and Tywin, who he had prior to this claimed to have caught in a lie.  Wouldn't catching someone in a lie warrant a vote to L-4 more than someone whose case you said was weak and only at L-5?<br><br>Additionally I just find him almost completely ignorant of Grey's existence until Grey is at L-2.  Then all of a sudden he is ok with lynching Grey.  But wait!  A claim!  Let's just stick with the weak opportunistic keyen wagon.  Followed immediately by a vote on the weak opportunistic keyen wagon by Grey... who you are also ok lynching... whose claim you do not believe and  you claim is caught scum?  So why not pass on keyen and go for the sure thing...the caught scum whose claim you do not believe (i.e. Grey)?  Or the liar (Tywin)?<br><br>I also do not think TwoFace and gerry would be a likely scum pairing.  So gerry moves up a little on my town list.  Gear/GreyICE take his place.<br><br>TwoFace or GreyICE are the only two I will vote today.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: TwoFace</span>"}

As for my ISO reads...screw them...when I have 2nd thoughts on my main scum read and now have suspicions towards one of my 2 top TRs (post-ISOs) they obviously aren't worth the pixels they're written in.

Basically if I was making a bunch of negative comments or had a lot of questions asking for clarification I was probably suspecting a player.  Good comments or outright saying I felt someone was town came from good posts I saw and a lack of either left people in the middle.<br><br>**************************<br>Early D3 <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8637618#p8637618\">Post 945</a> I give an update to my reads.  At this point Gamma has been outted as either a vig or an SK.  I lean towards him being a vig but either way he is probably not making it through N3.  He is most definitely not mafia though.  That leaves me gerry, Gear, TwoFace, JarJad and LUV as my scum pool.  As I'd been reading gerry as town throughout the game my focus was on the remaining four so I did ISO's to try to narrow it down.  I started with LUV and Gear because they had low post totals and left the more active posters for last.<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8641197#p8641197\">LUV and Gear ISOs</a>:  LUV's ISO 20 (vote on Grey) was the main reason I bumped up my town read on him.  I thought he made a good post/case on Grey and I did not see it coming from town.  More on this later.<br><br>WRT Gear...as I noted...there wasn't a lot to work with.  The main reason I was giving him a town bump was due to his defense of keyen.  On second look...what I failed to acknowledge was that in Gear's last content post of the game he basically backed off his defense of keyen for what I would call questionable reasons.  So my reason for town bumping him takes a hit.<br><br>The only thing in gerry's ISO that I really had a issue with was the way he ended D2 with the quick vote on Grey.  There were a few other things that piqued my attention a bit (ex. his ISO 59, 69 and 74).  But for the most part I think the good outweighs the bad and we have been of a similar mindset.  Still a town read for me.<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8650809#p8650809\">JarJar's ISO</a> looked town for the most part.  I'm a sucker for un-necessary and early committed bussing on a scum partner so I'm leaning towards JJD not doing this on Grey.  If he did....bravo.  I will say that post ISO on him I have not liked his play towards me.  Call it omgus or whatever but I do not think his reasoning for voting me has been warranted and fmpov he is pushing a mislynch.<br><br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8654816#p8654816\">TwoFace's ISO</a> is pretty self-explanatory and I give my reasons for suspecting him.  Minus the comments about his case on keyen being weak.  I also state that I felt it unlikely gerry and 2F would be scum partners so that moved gerry out of and Gear into my bottom two with 2F.<br><br>*************************<br><br>My opinions since all of the reads before are pretty much the same with the exception of LUV.  It's not a big move but I would drop LUV from my top 2 based on his play today...which IMO has been terrible...and have this <span class=\"noboldsig\">scum pool: 2F, Gear/Cloud and LUV.</span><br><br>In regards to LUV...on further review of his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8595081#p8595081\">Grey case/vote</a> that I gave him a strong town lean for...if LUV is scum, he really did not go out that much on a limb (like JJD) in making a case and placing a vote on Grey.  LUV has shown a willingness to bus and his L-3 vote on Grey came when Grey was the leading wagon and the only other two contenders att were JJD and Dave.  JJD was a LUV town read and Dave hadn't gotten his attention so bussing a partner was his only option.  Actually though...that's not true...he had expressed suspicions earlier towards keyen but rather than get off the Grey wagon after Grey had claimed...and move to the keyen wagon...he stayed camped on Grey and avoided the mislynch.<br><br><br>So there Gamma...those are my reads.  I hope they are clear.<br><br>I'd really be up for a LUV lynch based on that once over of his play.  The only thing I seriously gave LUV town cred for is now IMO  compromised.  And his play today has been terrible."}

This seems to happen a good amount Day 1 so I'm not seeing why it's an issue here. I honestly don't know what I could've said to prevent it from derailing. I stated why I felt he was scum and how that read first came about and assumed most people felt the same way. Key just dug his own hole honestly. Right from the start and probably sealed his fate as soon as he used an ongoing game to discredit TF. You can't prevent that from going through without a clear."}

That's how you play a good game. Regardless if I'm right or wrong about fitz or you, my reasons are out there and explained with detail and people can determine if I'm making sense or not. <br><br>Can you say you've done the same?

You telegraphed your vote on me day 3 from basically the jump and your isos were all biased with the idea that at the end you were going to vote me. <br><br>3. You don't do much if any scum hunting. You don't even really interact with people either. <br><br>4. You show suspicion of Gerry yet drop it without good reasoning and despite me catching him in 3 lies about how things happened in the game, you ignore them all and push me and refuse to vote him (see the point about bussing)<br><br>5. I've done at least 2 things that should at least make you think I could be town, yet you have refused to consider that possibility <br><br>So sorry, if you're town your play has been like scum</div></blockquote><br>1. This point makes no sense.  I very very rarely lynch a scum partner.  If I am on a scum lynch odds it's probably because the lynch was inevitable or unavoidable.  WRT Grey...you yourself have said D2 is of no relevence regarding his lynch (except for the gerry quickhammer).  I stated I would vote Grey and held off to allow some discussion but he was essentially quicklynched in a few hours.  So this is a misrep by you to infer my not being on Grey's D2 wagon is somehow AI towards me when you have already, correctly, stated nothing AI can be taken from being on it.<br><br>2. So you are saying you could tell I had suspicions towards you before I voted you?  Is that a scum tell?  If someone suspects another player and it's pretty obvious....that means the \"telegrapher\" is scum?  LOL wrong.<br><br>3. If by scum hunting you mean I don't tunnel on someone an entire long ass day and get them mislynched?  Or I don't hop on a scum wagon when caught scum is in auto lynch mode like Grey was?  Or I don't repeatedly accuse people of lying when they haven't or say people are doing things that they would normally do as town despite the fact I am not in their heads and do not know how they would act as town?  OK...you are right.  And the amount I intereact with people is NAI.  That depends on the game state..the participants in the game...how busy I may be in RL...and my usual post rate which is a lot less than someone like you or a player like JFSF.  (ahem)<br><br>4.  I have a level of suspicion towards everyone in the game that flutuates constantly.    Could gerry be scum?  Sure.  But who else has been clamoring on his wagon to get him lynched?  It's not like you are getting a ton of support.  Other than 2 pissed at him votes yesterday by LUV and Gamma it's been you pushing him for the most part.  Why isn't everyone else jumping on the GERRY LIED THREE TIMES wagon?  Why aren't you knocking them for not bowing down to the masterful scum case you have presented on gerry?  And you cannot knock me for not \"bussing\" gerry when you don't even know unequivocally that gerry is scum.  And if he is scum and I am not involved in getting him lynched...that doesn't mean I am scum because I am quite often wrong as town and not on scum lynches.  It's when I am ON a scum lynch that is telling....not off.  Also...iirc...I'm pretty sure one or two of the \"lies\" you are accusing gerry of I did not agree with.  I do not remember the 3rd.  I'll go look at them again.<br><br>5.  Where have I refused to consider you town?  That is a misrep.  I have not called you a lock to be scum and in fact I have felt less inclined to think you are scum towards the end of D3. Translation....TwoFace COULD be town.  In fact, right now I'm leaning towards a scumpool of Cloud, LUV and gerry.  I will say gerry and Cloud's opinions towards each other has peaked my suspicion.  Why have you not commented, iirc, on the lovefest between them (Cloud and gerry)?"}

I suspect him the most.  All of the lines in his ISO that I find suspect are highlighted in red or just black.<br><br>In short...I suspect TwoFace for tunneling keyen all D1 despite acknowledging that his vote on keyen was opportunistic and that his case on him was weak.  That there were no better alternatives to keyen despite a solid effort by JJD towards Gamma; and Tywin, who he had prior to this claimed to have caught in a lie.  Wouldn't catching someone in a lie warrant a vote to L-4 more than someone whose case you said was weak and only at L-5?<br><br>Additionally I just find him almost completely ignorant of Grey's existence until Grey is at L-2.  Then all of a sudden he is ok with lynching Grey.  But wait!  A claim!  Let's just stick with the weak opportunistic keyen wagon.  Followed immediately by a vote on the weak opportunistic keyen wagon by Grey... who you are also ok lynching... whose claim you do not believe and  you claim is caught scum?  So why not pass on keyen and go for the sure thing...the caught scum whose claim you do not believe (i.e. Grey)?  Or the liar (Tywin)?<br><br>I also do not think TwoFace and gerry would be a likely scum pairing.  So gerry moves up a little on my town list.  Gear/GreyICE take his place.<br><br>TwoFace or GreyICE are the only two I will vote today.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: TwoFace</span></div></blockquote><br><br>Here he continues his scumread on Twoface. The whole game he has had a SR on Twoface despite all the discussions between me and Twoface yesterday, making it clear we are not teamed. And he also went back to making me a TR at this point in the game. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8694116#p8694116\" class=\"postlink\">post 1635</a>, havingfitz wrote:</cite>Cloud's not getting any traction.<br>I don't like the gerry/Cloud buddy vibe.<br>Perusing some of gerry's scum games I see some similarities to this game.<br>Progressing this game. <br>= <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: gerry</span><br><br>If someone comes in and hammers and gerry is scum....I hope scum are smart enough to NK Gamma.

Now someone tell me does it make sense to suddenly vote with your hard SR the whole entire game, and vote someone who has had similar reads to you the whole game.

Also...if we mislynch and by some miracle Gamma is not NK'd (and he is an SK)...then I do not think the game would be over.  But that just makes my head hurt thinking of how that could play out.  Pretty sure town assured a loss regardless of what Gamma is if we mislynch today though.<br><br>And Gamma...with as powerful as the town has already proven to be with PRs...I highly doubt you are a vig.  But don't get all defensive about that because I have no interest in voting you.  The only way I could envision you being voted is if there were 2 more scum flips and the game was not over yet.

Why would he go straight to claiming if he thought his mafia partner was just posturing and not really going to vote him. I will say again that the timing of the posts are very important, it was a mere 20 mins. I didn't have time to vote him because as soon as i implied i was going to, he went straight to claiming BG. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8597364#p8597364\" class=\"postlink\">post 593</a>, Raskolnikov wrote:</cite>Claim was a little early.<br><br>If there's doctor they should hold off on counterclaiming until d2 minimum.</div></blockquote><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8597317#p8597317\" class=\"postlink\">post 591</a>, Tywin Lannister wrote:</cite><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: </span><br><br>Can't lynch a claim without a counter, at least D1.

Dave has posted all fluff/trash for the majority of his participation.  He did answer my questions, but he ignored gerryoats' for some unknown reason.  He ignored Rask's earlier questions as well, and I may be forgetting a few.  He hasn't posted any reads, because he claimed all are null, but when pushed he did say grey (and key I believe, but I'm on phone so not positive).  Regardless, he hasn't asked questions or scum hunted anyone by default.  It could be a case of being unfamiliar with forum Mafia, but I'd assume he'd still try to participate when he was told how this works.<br><br>So basically, the Dave case boils down to him being 'useless,' which he agreed with when I asked his thoughts on that.  His avoidance of answering questions looks scummy, and his lack of scum hunts does as well.  He does continue to post, so he's not lurking in the strictest sense, but he's added nothing to help town.

I believe my next post after that was 7 hours later at 4 PM. So i literally had no time. And I was not gonna lynch the BG claim. My argument here is that he had no reason to feel pressured to claim if he really thought I wasnt gonna vote him because I was his partner. <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"font-style: italic\">2.</span></span> The whole quick hammering day 2. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8615486#p8615486\" class=\"postlink\">post 809</a>, Gamma Emerald wrote:</cite>Okay, I am personally ready to lynch Grey.</div></blockquote><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8615537#p8615537\" class=\"postlink\">post 812</a>, ssbm_Kyouko wrote:</cite><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: grey</span><br> if this flips scum vig gear or havingfitz, pref gear. <br>L-1 I think</div></blockquote><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8615559#p8615559\" class=\"postlink\">post 815</a>, Gamma Emerald wrote:</cite><span class=\"noboldsig\">intent to hammer</span><br>I'm ready.

And that has been confirmed fmpov with you and LUV having passed on multiple opportunities to hammer me for what I attest would be a town loss."}

Why would he go straight to claiming if he thought his mafia partner was just posturing and not really going to vote him. I will say again that the timing of the posts are very important, it was a mere 20 mins. I didn't have time to vote him because as soon as i implied i was going to, he went straight to claiming BG. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8597364#p8597364\" class=\"postlink\">post 593</a>, Raskolnikov wrote:</cite>Claim was a little early.<br><br>If there's doctor they should hold off on counterclaiming until d2 minimum.</div></blockquote><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8597317#p8597317\" class=\"postlink\">post 591</a>, Tywin Lannister wrote:</cite><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: </span><br><br>Can't lynch a claim without a counter, at least D1.

Dave has posted all fluff/trash for the majority of his participation.  He did answer my questions, but he ignored gerryoats' for some unknown reason.  He ignored Rask's earlier questions as well, and I may be forgetting a few.  He hasn't posted any reads, because he claimed all are null, but when pushed he did say grey (and key I believe, but I'm on phone so not positive).  Regardless, he hasn't asked questions or scum hunted anyone by default.  It could be a case of being unfamiliar with forum Mafia, but I'd assume he'd still try to participate when he was told how this works.<br><br>So basically, the Dave case boils down to him being 'useless,' which he agreed with when I asked his thoughts on that.  His avoidance of answering questions looks scummy, and his lack of scum hunts does as well.  He does continue to post, so he's not lurking in the strictest sense, but he's added nothing to help town.

I believe my next post after that was 7 hours later at 4 PM. So i literally had no time. And I was not gonna lynch the BG claim. My argument here is that he had no reason to feel pressured to claim if he really thought I wasnt gonna vote him because I was his partner. <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"font-style: italic\">2.</span></span> The whole quick hammering day 2. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8615486#p8615486\" class=\"postlink\">post 809</a>, Gamma Emerald wrote:</cite>Okay, I am personally ready to lynch Grey.</div></blockquote><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8615537#p8615537\" class=\"postlink\">post 812</a>, ssbm_Kyouko wrote:</cite><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: grey</span><br> if this flips scum vig gear or havingfitz, pref gear. <br>L-1 I think</div></blockquote><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8615559#p8615559\" class=\"postlink\">post 815</a>, Gamma Emerald wrote:</cite><span class=\"noboldsig\">intent to hammer</span><br>I'm ready.
