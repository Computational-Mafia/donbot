All rules from <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=4&amp;t=6470\" class=\"postlink\">this post</a> apply here too.<br>\n2. Don't directly quote any game-related PMs I've sent you. Paraphrasing is OK.<br>\n3. Don't intentionally obfuscate your messages; cryptography, tiny text, and the like are not allowed.<br>\n4. Provable randomness, such as dice tags, is banned.<br>\n5. Treat your fellow users with respect. As a cool guy on this site once said, \"Attack the play, not the player.\"<br>\n6. Don't pretend to be the mod. Green is my color. Please don't use it. Specifically <div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF00\">#00BF00</div> and <div style=\"display:inline;color:#008000\">#008000</div><br>\n7. Each in-game day will last 14 days and each in-game night will last two days.<br>\n8.  I will prod players that haven't posted with game-advancing content for 48 hours. If a player is prodded and doesn't post within 24 hours of the prod, I will look for a replacement for that slot. I will replace a player if the player receives three prods. If you're in V/LA, you are exempt from the above rules for the duration of your V/LA. You must announce the V/LA either in-thread or in a PM to me.<br>\n9. If more than half of the live players vote for another player, they are lynched and removed from the game. After a lynching, all living players may post until the thread is locked: this time is called Twilight.<br>\n10. I will count votes if they are placed by the vote tag or in bold, and are recognizable as votes. Don't abuse this rule for trickery. Examples of these votes:<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: eagerSnake</span><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: eagerSnake</div><br>\n11. If a player wants to end the day without a lynching, they may vote for \"No Lynch.\" If a majority votes for No Lynch, the night will start early. If there is no majority vote by the deadline, no lynch will take place that Day.<br>\n12. Every player will have a Role, dictating what they can do during the night, if anything. Here's a sample PM for the role \"Vanilla Townie.\"\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Hello!<br>\n<br>\nYou are a <div style=\"display:inline;color:#008000\">Vanilla Townie</div>.<br>\n<br>\nYour powers include your voice and your vote! Use them well.<br>\n<br>\nYou win the game when all threats to the Town have been eliminated.<br>\n<br>\nConfirm your role by replying to me with your Role and Alignment.<br>\n<br>\nGood luck!<br>\n<br>\nGame Thread</div></blockquote>\n13. Players with roles and factional abilities, if any, can only choose one to use each night.<br>\n14. If you die, you are allowed one \"Bah\" post. You may not say anything game-related in it.<br>\n15. If you have any questions about these rules, PM me and I'll answer them. <br>\nAnd last but not least, don't forget to have fun!", "time": "Sat Dec 03, 2016 2:07 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=69456&start=0", "forum": "53", "thread": "69456"}

The fact that Keyen wasn't lynched is not because scum don't want to lynch their buddy or because people (town) are being cautious.

The fact that Keyen wasn't lynched is not because scum don't want to lynch their buddy or because people (town) are being cautious. It should be apparent to everyone involved that the wagon is not going to reach 7 because scum won't hammer town at that point in the game (because it gives them away) and town won't hammer anyone at that point in the game (because it gets them killed the next day).

It seems Rask is trying to avoid conversation here, and regardless if the question was about an older post (this game hasn't even been active long enough for that time lapse excuse), what exactly was wrong with the question to shut it down and claim 'this is so newbie' after?

He quoted posts from the 9 posts that I made back when he was townreading me.  Like I wanted to know which posts I've made SINCE that townread that changed his mind.  Like how in the hell does he quote a post that I made LITERALLY ON THE SAME PAGE that he said he townreads me.

But go back and read page 4.  He gave those reads completely voluntaraly w/o prompting from anyone.<br>\n<br>\n- And the 2nd reason that his answer is so horrible is that the reason he finds those posts scummy is because it \"looks like shoddy distancing\".  And who does it look I'm distancing myself from?  GEAR, the OTHER guy that Gamma gave an unprompted townread to in that post.  I'd like to know what made Gamma change his read of gear also.

I also don't like him putting me in as his essentially only town-read in that huge read list he posted.  I was at the top.  I question the wagon and he jumps on me as being super town, while Two Face jumps as if it connects me to Keyan.  Both extreme reactions seem contrived to me.  <br>\n<br>\nPsychodave has been given excuses for his supposed 'fast environment' as to why he posts fluff and/or scummy things.  He hasn't answered any questions posed to him, and for some reason, nobody has truly jumped on him with votes the way they have with Keyan.  Only a select few have questioned Dave or his motives at all.  That makes me suspicious.  Also, where is TwoFace giving his pairing if Dave flips scum?  I forgot which person it was that explained Dave away as 'fast paced environment' so I'll have to go back and find it, but I'm on my phone so it will take another post to do it.  Regardless, TwoFace should be pairing those two as well if he holds to his current reasoning.  Why hasn't this happened?<br>\n<br>\nGamma seems to vote randomly and gives little weight to them.  I questioned Rask's motivations about Lil Uzi, and gamma votes Lil Uzi right after.  I didn't get why, and it looked odd.  Then Rask questions gamma about his casual play, so gamma does a literal 3 minute ISO (supposedly) and changes votes.  Again, I don't see any real reason for it and there's no weight with the vote.  It seems to go on whomever seems easy at the time, but it doesn't look like Gamma legitimately believes they're voting scum in any instance.<br>\n<br>\nAll the mentions of TwoFace above lead me to mention a possible OMGUS read (on my part) on TwoFace. Mainly it's due to him trying to pair me with Keyan for questioning the early vote reasons on him.  He then says if Keyan flips town, he's not going to watch me anymore.  That doesn't seem like a townie statement.  Townie TwoFace should watch everyone regardless.  Whatever Keyan flips wouldn't make me more/less town.  What's the goal with the pairing statement?  He claims he isn't telling anyone else what to do after the fact, but told 'town' to watch me in his original post.  It seems like he's flip flopping his stance based on whether he gets questioned on it or not.  He also gets very defensive/abrasive about it too, which seems odd to me.  This may all be OMGUS/conf bias on my part though.  I'll let everyone else decide.  Regardless, I find his overall play to be scummy, although maybe he just likes being an Internet tough guy.

I think it's fairly normal for one to want to step back and take a look at the whole picture again regardless of new information. The analogies didn't help much at all since you can always sample food before tasting the whole thing. A better case or reasoning would've been why he felt the need to rush out reads when the game was still young and no one prompted him too. <br>\n<br>\nI'm not sure if the latter is a personality thing or scum who was desperate to establish himself early. Gamma's always is  a difficult read for me but that's mainly my fault since for some reason I always seem to not pay attention to him whenever we play. <br>\n<br>\nI think Tywin's issue with TF wanting to keep on eye on him is that he probably feels he hasn't done anything worthy of being seriously scum read at all. I can relate to that a lot and based on his join date I think it's a fair assessment of the interactions between those two. Really don't think there's anything there other than personalities clashing. <br>\n<br>\nI liked Key's big response to the pressure in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8592077#p8592077\">371</a>. Explained his actions and thoughts fairly well and while I don't  agree with his view on TF's willingness to vote him, his tone just feels town. Still not really understanding any of his reads at all but hey, most people don't understand mine in general half the time so I'm just going to work harder to understand them. <br>\n<br>\nMy vote is going to go to Grey though. Been keeping an eye on this guy from the start, everything from his entrance to his demeanor gives me the chills. There is no way that Grey didn't know who Gamma was before this game. Someone who has never played with a person or doesn't know their meta doesn't say \"It's Gamma.\" They're a more likely to say that's \"newb town\" or that's \"NAI\". Identifying with play style also doesn't justify that response. Even if he's telling the truth, that is not a reason to TR Gamma. I can identify with at least 3-4 people's play style this game but I'll be fool to TR them just solely on that. This tells me one thing and is that he doesn't have any real reads and he's just voting anyone that's a threat to him which is a big no in my book. <br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Grey</span></div></div></div>", "time": "Wed Dec 07, 2016 3:20 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=69456&start=550", "forum": "53", "thread": "69456"}

You don't state an actual stance, you just give an anecdote.</div></blockquote>\n\nShade throwing?  It's just a story.  I don't have an actual stance on whether grey is fake claiming or not.  It frankly doesn't matter rn anyway.  I just was reminded of when I claimed bodyguard in a past game while not town-aligned.  It is relevant in that I believe bodyguard is an easy claim to fake, but I'm not trying to get grey lynched right now.  <br>\n<br>\nWhat is odd to me is that you look at my story, one I didn't have to bring up at all, and again you claim it to somehow be AI.  You did the same when I pointed out that TwoFace lied.  Funny enough, I believe Kyou came and proved it again after the fight was over.  You took that opportunity to vote me for literally proving TwoFace lied about something.  That was your scum read. It seemed awfully fishy and still does.<br>\n<br>\nWhat I find extremely interesting is if grey is indeed a bodyguard, then you as scum of course would love him sheeping you.  You also clearly let him lead you to a vote on me without any pushback.  You didn't even question it or provide a reason why.  That's awesome for scum Gamma, because you'd have an out on why you tried to lynch a townie (me) by being led by another townie (grey).  Aside from that, when I asked you if it bothered you that grey was attaching himself to you, you clearly stated that no, you were very happy to have him do that.  That's definitely something scum would love, but a skeptical townie would not.<br>\n<br>\nAside from that, no votes from you have ever had any conviction or real reason behind them.  You've vote switched a ton of times, and every vote was useless in that you had no reasoning behind it.  You weren't pushing for any lynches, and you aren't scum hunting whatsoever.  You've only thrown doubt on other players, but do not ask questions in any attempt to find scum.  Why?  Is it because you already know they're all town?<br>\n<br>\nI find that if grey isn't scum, the probability of you being scum is much, much higher.", "time": "Thu Dec 08, 2016 11:27 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=69456&start=600", "forum": "53", "thread": "69456"}

I'm sharing a story, and you consider that scummy?  Okay then.  Enjoy your bad reads.  You'll find out eventually one way or another.</div></blockquote>\nIt looks like shade throwing. You don't state an actual stance, you just give an anecdote.</div></blockquote>\n\nShade throwing?  It's just a story.  I don't have an actual stance on whether grey is fake claiming or not.  It frankly doesn't matter rn anyway.  I just was reminded of when I claimed bodyguard in a past game while not town-aligned.  It is relevant in that I believe bodyguard is an easy claim to fake, but I'm not trying to get grey lynched right now.  <br>\n<br>\nWhat is odd to me is that you look at my story, one I didn't have to bring up at all, and again you claim it to somehow be AI.  You did the same when I pointed out that TwoFace lied.  Funny enough, I believe Kyou came and proved it again after the fight was over.  You took that opportunity to vote me for literally proving TwoFace lied about something.  That was your scum read. It seemed awfully fishy and still does.<br>\n<br>\nWhat I find extremely interesting is if grey is indeed a bodyguard, then you as scum of course would love him sheeping you.  You also clearly let him lead you to a vote on me without any pushback.  You didn't even question it or provide a reason why.  That's awesome for scum Gamma, because you'd have an out on why you tried to lynch a townie (me) by being led by another townie (grey).  Aside from that, when I asked you if it bothered you that grey was attaching himself to you, you clearly stated that no, you were very happy to have him do that.  That's definitely something scum would love, but a skeptical townie would not.<br>\n<br>\nAside from that, no votes from you have ever had any conviction or real reason behind them.  You've vote switched a ton of times, and every vote was useless in that you had no reasoning behind it.  You weren't pushing for any lynches, and you aren't scum hunting whatsoever.  You've only thrown doubt on other players, but do not ask questions in any attempt to find scum.  Why?  Is it because you already know they're all town?<br>\n<br>\nI find that if grey isn't scum, the probability of you being scum is much, much higher.</div></blockquote>\n\nPinged", "time": "Thu Dec 08, 2016 8:27 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=69456&start=625", "forum": "53", "thread": "69456"}

Interesting story there Tywin.<br>\n...by which I mean that's pretty scummy.</div></blockquote>\n\nHow is it scummy?  Lol, you can't throw around the word to fit whatever you want.  I'm sharing a story, and you consider that scummy?  Okay then.  Enjoy your bad reads.  You'll find out eventually one way or another.</div></blockquote>\nIt looks like shade throwing. You don't state an actual stance, you just give an anecdote.</div></blockquote>\n\nShade throwing?  It's just a story.  I don't have an actual stance on whether grey is fake claiming or not.  It frankly doesn't matter rn anyway.  I just was reminded of when I claimed bodyguard in a past game while not town-aligned.  It is relevant in that I believe bodyguard is an easy claim to fake, but I'm not trying to get grey lynched right now.  <br>\n<br>\nWhat is odd to me is that you look at my story, one I didn't have to bring up at all, and again you claim it to somehow be AI.  You did the same when I pointed out that TwoFace lied.  Funny enough, I believe Kyou came and proved it again after the fight was over.  You took that opportunity to vote me for literally proving TwoFace lied about something.  That was your scum read. It seemed awfully fishy and still does.<br>\n<br>\nWhat I find extremely interesting is if grey is indeed a bodyguard, then you as scum of course would love him sheeping you.  You also clearly let him lead you to a vote on me without any pushback.  You didn't even question it or provide a reason why.  That's awesome for scum Gamma, because you'd have an out on why you tried to lynch a townie (me) by being led by another townie (grey).  Aside from that, when I asked you if it bothered you that grey was attaching himself to you, you clearly stated that no, you were very happy to have him do that.  That's definitely something scum would love, but a skeptical townie would not.<br>\n<br>\nAside from that, no votes from you have ever had any conviction or real reason behind them.  You've vote switched a ton of times, and every vote was useless in that you had no reasoning behind it.  You weren't pushing for any lynches, and you aren't scum hunting whatsoever.  You've only thrown doubt on other players, but do not ask questions in any attempt to find scum.  Why?  Is it because you already know they're all town?<br>\n<br>\nI find that if grey isn't scum, the probability of you being scum is much, much higher.</div></blockquote>\n\nPinged</div></blockquote>\nwhat is this", "time": "Fri Dec 09, 2016 3:04 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=69456&start=625", "forum": "53", "thread": "69456"}

It aligns with my general reads so far.  I've been suspicious of Gamma for a while now.  I haven't been paying much attention to gear, but I don't have a town read on him from what I have seen.  Idk about grey anymore after the claim, but i don't think it matters right now.  If he's scum, then he will get lynched eventually regardless.  That may be why he lost interest and wants out.  It isn't like he has much chance to survive RN regardless of alignment.<br>\n<br>\nAs for the rest in that second tier, I largely have neutral reads on most of them.  I've gotten more townie vibes from lil Uzi than anything, but it isn't nearly as strong as I do from Jar Jar, Rask, and TF.  I've also gotten them from Kyou.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nNow that I see key's post 222 again, I like it even less.  I'm the only 'real town' read he has, which probably came from questioning his wagon.  I don't like Gamma in the 'leaning town' read.  I don't have a real read on vij yet (need to ISO him, gear, and key I think), and my townie read of Kyou may be due to the 'Tywin was right about TF' post, so it's inherently biased on my part. <br>\n<br>\nI really don't like Rask/TF in the 'leaning scum' section.  I find myself nodding my head at the majority of Rask's posts this game, and while I disagree with TF on semantics here and there, he reads as an aggressive town.  I can't say I've never played/posted the way he has, and I've always done it as town.  Scum just play more careful in my experience, while town with nothing to lose are usually the hyper-aggressive ones like TF is playing.  Dave is whatever to me.  Now that I see people post key's quotes (plus JJD's perspective on key's wagon/possible scbuddies), I can see how key is the scummier player.  <br>\n<br>\nIdk about Gear in the 'definite scum' list, but I really don't like JJD there.  His posts have been townie and have largely moved the game forward.  At the least, they're far more helpful to town than any combination of key/gear/Dave/Gamma/grey.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nSorry for wall, but basically, I'm okay with a key lynch, especially after his latest posts.  He really hasn't scum hunted as TF pointed out, and mainly it's been a lot of whining/flailing (no offense key).  My main concern was the early wagon gaining traction so quickly, but I agree with JJD's points in how I could be looking at it wrong.  If I dismiss that one concern, key does look like flailing scum.  There aren't any real pro-town posts from him as far as I've seen.</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\nTl;dr:  I like Rask's scum list.  I really dislike key's post 222 read list.  I agree with the points JJD/TF have recently made.  Probably will vote key after I reread a few players I've not been paying much attention to, key included.  My top townies agree that key is probable scum, and I don't disagree with that perspective anymore.  I'm not 100% sold, but if we won't be lynching Gamma, I'll go with key.

I'm sharing a story, and you consider that scummy?  Okay then.  Enjoy your bad reads.  You'll find out eventually one way or another.</div></blockquote>\nIt looks like shade throwing. You don't state an actual stance, you just give an anecdote.</div></blockquote>\n\nShade throwing?  It's just a story.  I don't have an actual stance on whether grey is fake claiming or not.  It frankly doesn't matter rn anyway.  I just was reminded of when I claimed bodyguard in a past game while not town-aligned.  It is relevant in that I believe bodyguard is an easy claim to fake, but I'm not trying to get grey lynched right now.  <br>\n<br>\nWhat is odd to me is that you look at my story, one I didn't have to bring up at all, and again you claim it to somehow be AI.  You did the same when I pointed out that TwoFace lied.  Funny enough, I believe Kyou came and proved it again after the fight was over.  You took that opportunity to vote me for literally proving TwoFace lied about something.  That was your scum read. It seemed awfully fishy and still does.<br>\n<br>\nWhat I find extremely interesting is if grey is indeed a bodyguard, then you as scum of course would love him sheeping you.  You also clearly let him lead you to a vote on me without any pushback.  You didn't even question it or provide a reason why.  That's awesome for scum Gamma, because you'd have an out on why you tried to lynch a townie (me) by being led by another townie (grey).  Aside from that, when I asked you if it bothered you that grey was attaching himself to you, you clearly stated that no, you were very happy to have him do that.  That's definitely something scum would love, but a skeptical townie would not.<br>\n<br>\nAside from that, no votes from you have ever had any conviction or real reason behind them.  You've vote switched a ton of times, and every vote was useless in that you had no reasoning behind it.  You weren't pushing for any lynches, and you aren't scum hunting whatsoever.  You've only thrown doubt on other players, but do not ask questions in any attempt to find scum.  Why?  Is it because you already know they're all town?<br>\n<br>\nI find that if grey isn't scum, the probability of you being scum is much, much higher.</div></blockquote>\n\nPinged</div></blockquote>\nBump.

Who knows if he would've even acknowledged my request, and I'm fine with moving the game forward.  I figured he'd stick around at least to write another post, but apparently not if he already logged. <br>\n<br>\nThe few players I can think of that had objections to this wagon was Gerryoats, vij maybe, you somewhat.  Gerry posted earlier throwing shade on me for switching my stance on Keyen, but didn't exactly give another target.  He's still all for the Dave wagon, which isn't going to happen today.  Key wants Dave too, but only due to it being someone other than him, not due to a scum read.

I suspect him the most.  All of the lines in his ISO that I find suspect are highlighted in red or just black.<br>\n<br>\nIn short...I suspect TwoFace for tunneling keyen all D1 despite acknowledging that his vote on keyen was opportunistic and that his case on him was weak.  That there were no better alternatives to keyen despite a solid effort by JJD towards Gamma; and Tywin, who he had prior to this claimed to have caught in a lie.  Wouldn't catching someone in a lie warrant a vote to L-4 more than someone whose case you said was weak and only at L-5?<br>\n<br>\nAdditionally I just find him almost completely ignorant of Grey's existence until Grey is at L-2.  Then all of a sudden he is ok with lynching Grey.  But wait!  A claim!  Let's just stick with the weak opportunistic keyen wagon.  Followed immediately by a vote on the weak opportunistic keyen wagon by Grey... who you are also ok lynching... whose claim you do not believe and  you claim is caught scum?  So why not pass on keyen and go for the sure thing...the caught scum whose claim you do not believe (i.e. Grey)?  Or the liar (Tywin)?<br>\n<br>\nI also do not think TwoFace and gerry would be a likely scum pairing.  So gerry moves up a little on my town list.  Gear/GreyICE take his place.<br>\n<br>\nTwoFace or GreyICE are the only two I will vote today.<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: TwoFace</span>", "time": "Fri Dec 23, 2016 6:10 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=69456&start=1100", "forum": "53", "thread": "69456"}

That there were no better alternatives to keyen despite a solid effort by JJD towards Gamma; and Tywin, who he had prior to this claimed to have caught in a lie.  Wouldn't catching someone in a lie warrant a vote to L-4 more than someone whose case you said was weak and only at L-5?<br>\n<br>\nAdditionally I just find him almost completely ignorant of Grey's existence until Grey is at L-2.  Then all of a sudden he is ok with lynching Grey.  But wait!  A claim!  Let's just stick with the weak opportunistic keyen wagon.  Followed immediately by a vote on the weak opportunistic keyen wagon by Grey... who you are also ok lynching... whose claim you do not believe and  you claim is caught scum?  So why not pass on keyen and go for the sure thing...the caught scum whose claim you do not believe (i.e. Grey)?  Or the liar (Tywin)?<br>\n<br>\nI also do not think TwoFace and gerry would be a likely scum pairing.  So gerry moves up a little on my town list.  Gear/GreyICE take his place.<br>\n<br>\nTwoFace or GreyICE are the only two I will vote today.<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: TwoFace</span></div></blockquote>\n\ngood vote", "time": "Fri Dec 23, 2016 2:26 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=69456&start=1125", "forum": "53", "thread": "69456"}

I'm having 2nd thoughts that someone as misguided and offensive as you is scum.  The fact that your wagon, regardless of your alignment, is not getting more traction is amazing and disconcerting to me as well.  I did not like LUVs quick vote on me to L-1, it felt very convenient and lazy, along with the fact he has never expressed any sort of case on me that I can see.  As for my ISO reads...screw them...when I have 2nd thoughts on my main scum read and now have suspicions towards one of my 2 top TRs (post-ISOs) they obviously aren't worth the pixels they're written in.  Gamma is the only sure thing in this game fmpov and that is that he is not mafia.

Because I had the nerve to leave you as a potential suspect prior to ISO'ing you?

Basically if I was making a bunch of negative comments or had a lot of questions asking for clarification I was probably suspecting a player.  Good comments or outright saying I felt someone was town came from good posts I saw and a lack of either left people in the middle.<br>\n<br>\n**************************<br>\nEarly D3 <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8637618#p8637618\">Post 945</a> I give an update to my reads.  At this point Gamma has been outted as either a vig or an SK.  I lean towards him being a vig but either way he is probably not making it through N3.  He is most definitely not mafia though.  That leaves me gerry, Gear, TwoFace, JarJad and LUV as my scum pool.  As I'd been reading gerry as town throughout the game my focus was on the remaining four so I did ISO's to try to narrow it down.  I started with LUV and Gear because they had low post totals and left the more active posters for last.<br>\n<br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8641197#p8641197\">LUV and Gear ISOs</a>:  LUV's ISO 20 (vote on Grey) was the main reason I bumped up my town read on him.  I thought he made a good post/case on Grey and I did not see it coming from town.  More on this later.<br>\n<br>\nWRT Gear...as I noted...there wasn't a lot to work with.  The main reason I was giving him a town bump was due to his defense of keyen.  On second look...what I failed to acknowledge was that in Gear's last content post of the game he basically backed off his defense of keyen for what I would call questionable reasons.  So my reason for town bumping him takes a hit.<br>\n<br>\nThe only thing in gerry's ISO that I really had a issue with was the way he ended D2 with the quick vote on Grey.  There were a few other things that piqued my attention a bit (ex. his ISO 59, 69 and 74).  But for the most part I think the good outweighs the bad and we have been of a similar mindset.  Still a town read for me.<br>\n<br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8650809#p8650809\">JarJar's ISO</a> looked town for the most part.  I'm a sucker for un-necessary and early committed bussing on a scum partner so I'm leaning towards JJD not doing this on Grey.  If he did....bravo.  I will say that post ISO on him I have not liked his play towards me.  Call it omgus or whatever but I do not think his reasoning for voting me has been warranted and fmpov he is pushing a mislynch.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8654816#p8654816\">TwoFace's ISO</a> is pretty self-explanatory and I give my reasons for suspecting him.  Minus the comments about his case on keyen being weak.  I also state that I felt it unlikely gerry and 2F would be scum partners so that moved gerry out of and Gear into my bottom two with 2F.<br>\n<br>\n*************************<br>\n<br>\nMy opinions since all of the reads before are pretty much the same with the exception of LUV.  It's not a big move but I would drop LUV from my top 2 based on his play today...which IMO has been terrible...and have this <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">scum pool: 2F, Gear/Cloud and LUV.</div><br>\n<br>\nIn regards to LUV...on further review of his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8595081#p8595081\">Grey case/vote</a> that I gave him a strong town lean for...if LUV is scum, he really did not go out that much on a limb (like JJD) in making a case and placing a vote on Grey.  LUV has shown a willingness to bus and his L-3 vote on Grey came when Grey was the leading wagon and the only other two contenders att were JJD and Dave.  JJD was a LUV town read and Dave hadn't gotten his attention so bussing a partner was his only option.  Actually though...that's not true...he had expressed suspicions earlier towards keyen but rather than get off the Grey wagon after Grey had claimed...and move to the keyen wagon...he stayed camped on Grey and avoided the mislynch.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nSo there Gamma...those are my reads.  I hope they are clear.<br>\n<br>\nI'd really be up for a LUV lynch based on that once over of his play.  The only thing I seriously gave LUV town cred for is now IMO  compromised.

So you are saying you could tell I had suspicions towards you before I voted you?  Is that a scum tell?  If someone suspects another player and it's pretty obvious....that means the \"telegrapher\" is scum?  LOL wrong.<br>\n<br>\n3. If by scum hunting you mean I don't tunnel on someone an entire long ass day and get them mislynched?  Or I don't hop on a scum wagon when caught scum is in auto lynch mode like Grey was?  Or I don't repeatedly accuse people of lying when they haven't or say people are doing things that they would normally do as town despite the fact I am not in their heads and do not know how they would act as town?  OK...you are right.  And the amount I intereact with people is NAI.  That depends on the game state..the participants in the game...how busy I may be in RL...and my usual post rate which is a lot less than someone like you or a player like JFSF.  (ahem)<br>\n<br>\n4.  I have a level of suspicion towards everyone in the game that flutuates constantly.    Could gerry be scum?  Sure.  But who else has been clamoring on his wagon to get him lynched?  It's not like you are getting a ton of support.  Other than 2 pissed at him votes yesterday by LUV and Gamma it's been you pushing him for the most part.  Why isn't everyone else jumping on the GERRY LIED THREE TIMES wagon?  Why aren't you knocking them for not bowing down to the masterful scum case you have presented on gerry?  And you cannot knock me for not \"bussing\" gerry when you don't even know unequivocally that gerry is scum.  And if he is scum and I am not involved in getting him lynched...that doesn't mean I am scum because I am quite often wrong as town and not on scum lynches.  It's when I am ON a scum lynch that is telling....not off.  Also...iirc...I'm pretty sure one or two of the \"lies\" you are accusing gerry of I did not agree with.  I do not remember the 3rd.  I'll go look at them again.<br>\n<br>\n5.  Where have I refused to consider you town?  That is a misrep.  I have not called you a lock to be scum and in fact I have felt less inclined to think you are scum towards the end of D3. Translation....TwoFace COULD be town.  In fact, right now I'm leaning towards a scumpool of Cloud, LUV and gerry.  I will say gerry and Cloud's opinions towards each other has peaked my suspicion.  Why have you not commented, iirc, on the lovefest between them (Cloud and gerry)?", "time": "Thu Jan 05, 2017 2:44 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=69456&start=1550", "forum": "53", "thread": "69456"}

I suspect him the most.  All of the lines in his ISO that I find suspect are highlighted in red or just black.<br>\n<br>\nIn short...I suspect TwoFace for tunneling keyen all D1 despite acknowledging that his vote on keyen was opportunistic and that his case on him was weak.  That there were no better alternatives to keyen despite a solid effort by JJD towards Gamma; and Tywin, who he had prior to this claimed to have caught in a lie.  Wouldn't catching someone in a lie warrant a vote to L-4 more than someone whose case you said was weak and only at L-5?<br>\n<br>\nAdditionally I just find him almost completely ignorant of Grey's existence until Grey is at L-2.  Then all of a sudden he is ok with lynching Grey.  But wait!  A claim!  Let's just stick with the weak opportunistic keyen wagon.  Followed immediately by a vote on the weak opportunistic keyen wagon by Grey... who you are also ok lynching... whose claim you do not believe and  you claim is caught scum?  So why not pass on keyen and go for the sure thing...the caught scum whose claim you do not believe (i.e. Grey)?  Or the liar (Tywin)?<br>\n<br>\nI also do not think TwoFace and gerry would be a likely scum pairing.  So gerry moves up a little on my town list.  Gear/GreyICE take his place.<br>\n<br>\nTwoFace or GreyICE are the only two I will vote today.<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: TwoFace</span></div></blockquote>\n\nHere he continues his scumread on Twoface. The whole game he has had a SR on Twoface despite all the discussions between me and Twoface yesterday, making it clear we are not teamed.

Even if we lynch scum today I'm not sure how it plays out tonight if Gamma is not the NK.  If he actually is the vig then a scum lynch today would at least enable him to try another shot tonight and town would still have a chance.<br>\n<br>\nI'm pretty sure a mislynch results in end of game, unless there were only 2 scum in this game to begin with which I highly doubt with as powerful town has been.  Also...if we mislynch and by some miracle Gamma is not NK'd (and he is an SK)...then I do not think the game would be over.  But that just makes my head hurt thinking of how that could play out.  Pretty sure town assured a loss regardless of what Gamma is if we mislynch today though.<br>\n<br>\nAnd Gamma...with as powerful as the town has already proven to be with PRs...I highly doubt you are a vig.  But don't get all defensive about that because I have no interest in voting you.  The only way I could envision you being voted is if there were 2 more scum flips and the game was not over yet.  And it was you and 2 others still alive.  Then you would of course be the lynch.<br>\n<br>\nGerry...that case you presented on me is terrible.  If you look over my game...at some point I have suspected everyone in this game.  Even you.

Dave has posted all fluff/trash for the majority of his participation.  He did answer my questions, but he ignored gerryoats' for some unknown reason.  He ignored Rask's earlier questions as well, and I may be forgetting a few.  He hasn't posted any reads, because he claimed all are null, but when pushed he did say grey (and key I believe, but I'm on phone so not positive).  Regardless, he hasn't asked questions or scum hunted anyone by default.  It could be a case of being unfamiliar with forum Mafia, but I'd assume he'd still try to participate when he was told how this works.<br>\n<br>\nSo basically, the Dave case boils down to him being 'useless,' which he agreed with when I asked his thoughts on that.  His avoidance of answering questions looks scummy, and his lack of scum hunts does as well.  He does continue to post, so he's not lurking in the strictest sense, but he's added nothing to help town.

I believe my next post after that was 7 hours later at 4 PM. So i literally had no time. And I was not gonna lynch the BG claim.

Dave has posted all fluff/trash for the majority of his participation.  He did answer my questions, but he ignored gerryoats' for some unknown reason.  He ignored Rask's earlier questions as well, and I may be forgetting a few.  He hasn't posted any reads, because he claimed all are null, but when pushed he did say grey (and key I believe, but I'm on phone so not positive).  Regardless, he hasn't asked questions or scum hunted anyone by default.  It could be a case of being unfamiliar with forum Mafia, but I'd assume he'd still try to participate when he was told how this works.<br>\n<br>\nSo basically, the Dave case boils down to him being 'useless,' which he agreed with when I asked his thoughts on that.  His avoidance of answering questions looks scummy, and his lack of scum hunts does as well.

I believe my next post after that was 7 hours later at 4 PM. So i literally had no time. And I was not gonna lynch the BG claim.
