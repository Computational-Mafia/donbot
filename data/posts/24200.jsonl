I was pointing out that you asked what was so scummy about scumhunting while in fact you weren't actually scumhunting, just showing your eagerness to scumhunt - which is the tell that Mephistopheles voted you for.

If I recall correctly, my post was in reference to the lack of material for anyone to scumhunt at all.</div></blockquote><br><br>That's nitpicking. There are many ways to skin a cat, and although you included the rest of the players in your complaint, you did implicitly go somewhat out of your way to draw attention to your eagerness for scumhunting, which is a textbook scumtell. My phrasing may have been off there (at least in your eyes) but I believe the tell is still there. Mind you, I don't think it's super-strong tell, but it's something to go on at this stage.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4513975#p4513975\" class=\"postlink\">post 29</a>, Kthxbye wrote:</cite>Grats, you are scum.</div></blockquote><br><br>I'm not sure whether that's meant to rattle me or whether you're just that rattled yourself, but at any rate <span style=\"font-style: italic\">I'm perfectly calm.

I read it as such because Kthxbye devotes the post that Conman was responding to mainly to complaining about lurkers (something that I myself feel is a problem in this game btw) and then votes Conman for lurking and not paying attention, and Conman responds to this by saying that Kthxbye is 'rather quick to try and take votes of [himself] and try to blame other people', where other people seems to mean just him, Conman. If this was really referring to Kthxbye's behavior in general, I'd have thought that Conman would have said something about Kthxbye earlier, which he never did. And the blaming other people part seems pretty weird in a game that's all about finding some fault with the other players (although it could be a newbie thing, but I get a bad vibe from it). Adding fuel to the kneejerk-feel fire, Conman completely ignores NS's question about the reason behind his earlier vote - as Slandaar has already pointed out."}

Yet he asks Conman for his reasons in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4516991#p4516991\" class=\"postlink\">post 69</a>; why not ask for mine? Is he hoping I'll drop him in favour of Conman who I had previously expressed suspicion of?<br><br>My original case was the fuss about scumhunting and his going after people who did seem to me to be hunting (<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4514562#p4514562\" class=\"postlink\">post 41</a>, <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4514631#p4514631\" class=\"postlink\">post 43</a> and <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4514990#p4514990\" class=\"postlink\">post 48</a>). <br><br>In addition the first line of 66 is odd. Why did he expect Meph to comment on a question addressed to Conman before Conman had replied to it?

Instead of providing a straight answer, absta fires back a question implying that the reason should have been obvious. That's not townish in my eyes, and neither is the relentlessness with which absta has been pursuing this matter. It seems to me that Huntress simply did what one does in this game; proposed a hypothesis based on a hunch, a wild guess even, to check the reaction, keep things moving, etc. Mind you, this was on page 3 where some guesswork is to be expected. The accusation was certainly not terrible and absta could have handled it gracefully instead of getting argumentative.<br><br>tl;dr: I agree with Huntress here.

Kthxbye is tunneling pretty hard, which means that he's doing the scum's job for them if Conman is town.

SK has posted virtually nothing.<br>If we decide that \"yeah, these players are playing like shit\" and we lynch them, we will not win. The entire point of the game of mafia is that a group of contributing people determines \"okay, this person is scum and this person is scum\" and then campaigns for votes to get that person lynched. If we wait for the point of the game where everyone is contributing, we will lose. Remember that newbie game where you and Jon were scum and you coasted to victory on PM and Arugula lynches?

He's leaning scum to you, but you are willing to hammer him and you want a claim. <br>There's many reasons why players wouldn't want scum to support their own lynch. It makes it harder to actually find the other remaining scum. I'd be all for scum to support their own lynch when they are the last one alive, but not during Day 1 or even other Days without scum flips. It makes it so much easier to find connections with scum flips when they don't support their own lynch as opposed to days when they support it.<br><br>5.

I get where you're going with your case though and I note that absta responds to it in very much the same way as he responds to Huntress' case (regarding the very same post #44 but for a different reason, funnily enough); fires back with a question instead of explaining what he was thinking back then.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4540507#p4540507\" class=\"postlink\">post 325</a>, Malakittens wrote:</cite>2.

I'd be all for scum to support their own lynch when they are the last one alive, but not during Day 1 or even other Days without scum flips.

While self-votes possibly give some information, scum being on their own lynch wagon gives no real information about any player except said scum, which doesn't matter since the scum is confirmed and dead at the end of the day anyway. Which incidentally make scum more likely than town to self-vote in my eyes, especially when they seem to be close to getting lynched anyway, as the self-vote works to deprive the town of information, especially if the scum hammers himself and just ends the day.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4540507#p4540507\" class=\"postlink\">post 325</a>, Malakittens wrote:</cite>@Gorgon:<br><br>After reading my current posts do you still think I'm scummy?

Conjecturing on why someone replaced out 6 days after the fact once you start getting in hot water is super weaksauce.  Some might even call it scummy.  In fact, I think I am."}

And last, you honestly think we are so damned good that the 2 largest wagons on DAY ONE were BOTH on scum?  Wow...I can't wait to see the answer to these...<br><br>I really thought that huntress was scum and am surprised to see she wasn't only town but a PR.

Not gonna speculate at what PR shot huntress at this time, but I'm guessing it's probably a town shot as I thought she was scum and could easily imagine other town thinking the same due to Conman flipping scum.

If they thought he would draw the Lynch (obv from their perspective),  it'd be a grand opportunity to gain TownCred by riding that shit to the end. <span class=\"noboldsig\">I actually like my Slandaar Wagon from yesterday for that very reason.</span><br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Slandaar</span></div></blockquote><br><br>Can't believe I missed this.  From this post, the bold looks in reference to the \"grand opportunity to gain TownCred by riding that shit to the end\"....yet, Slandaar didn't right that to the end did he?  So you recommend looking for the weakest and/or earliest votes on Conman that rode it to the end, yet like your Slandaar wagon even though Slandaar didn't do what you recommend us looking at first?"}

SK seems suspicious of Dun's vote, but then switches over to the vote being not suspicious when Conman flips scum since he feels that scum voting scum at that point would have been an unlikely move. This strengthens SK's claimed read of Conman as town VI in my eyes and makes SK more likely town in my eyes than I had pegged him as (I have had a gut feeling about something being off about his posts, which I've have a hard time nailing down though). I read a townish sincerity into the flow of these thoughts, to wax poetic.<br><br>And oh, merry Christmas!"}

A Policy Lynch pretty much covers all Lynches that are not for the expressed purpose of Lynching Scum.  A VI is, by definition, not Scum.  It's an AntiTown player, but if you don't feel the VI is scummy, you're not Lynching for Scum, you're Lynching to make the game easier or more palatable.

Yeah, I'm still wishy-washy like that. <br><br>I have been rereading the game and even focusing on particular people and seeing reasons that they might be scum, but then I see good reasons that they are not scum too.

If someone gets a train of thought like that wrong it's most likely that it's because that someone doesn't have his train of thought neatly railed down, as scum do. Their derailments have to be faked, and they are seldom as obvious as that in my experience.<br><br>I have a few people that I'm pretty convinced are <span style=\"font-style: italic\">town</span>, but the rest are pretty much in the same unfruitful 50/50 category as of yet.

You kept your Vote on me and were definitely around when the Wagons were neck and neck.  How is this twisting anything, check the Iso Vote counts and your posts.  I'll wait...<br><br>So, when did you plan to get back on the Wagon?  You abandoned the Conman Wagon when it lost steam for a weak Vote against me.  You didn't get back on the Conman Wagon.  You were pushing hard against me while the Conman Wagon gained steam back.  If you had jumped back on right before the Lynch, yes, it would've looked terribad.

There is no 'defending' something that doesn't need defending.  I'm not ignoring anything.  I came out in the 1st post of D2 and said it, I even said that I can see how others would find that scummy.  What do you think I've been ignoring, exactly?  If that's it, I'm not doing a very good job of ignoring something that I'm pointing out, huh?<br><br>The rest of your post is Confirmation Bias.  Of course I can call his play like it was D2, I know he was Scum now.  Nothing in his play pointed Scum to me.  If I didn't read the flip, I'd still think he was VI.  I would've backed a Policy Lynch on him before MyLo, but that's it {unless he started acting scummy, imo}.

Also, you yourself were also amongst the ones pushing strongly for Conman's lynch while your claim that several townies were going so far as to defend Conman is something of an overstatement as far as I can tell. Especially on the pages leading up to Conman's lynch, the overall mood was much more 'Conman is obvscum or deserves a policy lynch' and SiN was really the only player to consistently defend him hard. You may correct me if I'm wrong but that's how I read it. Dun voting Conman right after NS states an intent to hammer Slandaar and asks him to claim also makes a lot of sense in this scenario, as Conman was very obviously a weaker player than Slandaar, so it was much better to just let Conman go than having Slandaar be forced to claim or even being lynched. To put it simply, with Dun/Slaandar/Conman being the scum team, Dun had to choose between scumpartners as one of them was obviously getting lynched at the end of the day - and that choice was pretty much a no-brainer.<br><br>So in short, your claimed inconsistency in d3x's case is simply not there."}

Considering that absta was absent for the later half of day 2, it might be more plausible than I thought. And slandaar's lack of a counter-vote on conman at the end of day 1 is also pretty scummy. Maybe you're right about the set-up after all, and dun's last second switch doesn't clear him.<br><br>Re-reading day 1 has convinced me that your case is at least plausible. And the absta posts begging conman to get out do look pretty bad. <br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: d3x</span><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: dunhamganger</span>"}

I think L-1 should only really be maintained when there is a very clear emerging consensus that the wagoned player should be lynched. Early hard pressure is all good, but L-1 is where that fun ends as far as I'm concerned. If you find this attitude not to be protown I would love to hear more about it. I can kind of get that this could be, in this particular case, attributed to wanting to protect a scumbuddy, but that's nothing but confirmation bias unless you can explain why a town me would not have been likely to unvote at that point.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4617130#p4617130\" class=\"postlink\">post 692</a>, Slandaar wrote:</cite>then never rejoins</div></blockquote><br><br>Well, neither did you, although to be fair you stated your intention to rejoin pretty clearly. I was leaning towards it in my second to last post before the lynch, but the actual lynch happened in my absence. I probably would have contributed to Conman's lynch if the day had been longer but I do realize that those words are just wind now as it's actions that count the most. But as I said I wasn't around for the final push no more than you were, so it's strange for you to paint it as sketchy, unless of course you can explain why it's sketchy in my case and not in your own case.<br><br>And my reason for voting other people than Conman? Partly the same as your stated reasons for the same behavior, exploring other options and reaction testing. Also, I was genuinely very confused by the guy (in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4520634#p4520634\" class=\"postlink\">#130</a> I was even leaning town on him) which was yet more reason to find it profitable to kind of leave him on the backburner for a while and concentrate on people I could get a better read on, and I think it was, all things considered.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4617130#p4617130\" class=\"postlink\">post 692</a>, Slandaar wrote:</cite>and his dodging argument was beyond laughable I don't see town making it; 'he is dodging explaing why conman inventing reads is scummy!, he is dodging explaining why voting people with no reason is scummy! he is also dodging why avoiding questions is scummy!' nonsensical.</div></blockquote> <br><br>I thought I had finally managed to state this relatively clearly in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4551233#p4551233\" class=\"postlink\">#430</a>, but obviously you disagree. Going back through that convo I see that I never addressed your question regarding what you were supposed to be trying to achieve by this dodging ... so let's see. As I said in #430, instead of addressing d3x's request in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4544859#p4544859\" class=\"postlink\">#372</a> that you explained your vote on Conman, you jumped on him claiming to have found scum. This was my main reason for voting you back then. I felt your case against d3x to be contrived and overly militant considering what you (as I see it) actually had to work with, i.e. not protown. So I guess if I had to answer your question it seems to me that scum-you might have been trying to aggressively push a contrived case at the expense of a more 'civilized', protown discourse. I can definitely see the need for aggression for reaction checking from time to time of course, but this push of yours just seemed off to me. Manufactured, just as you say you feel about my posts. It's also pretty convenient that you were already painting d3x as Conman's buddy on D1 and attacking his 'Conman is VI' line and now that Conman is confirmed scum that's an easy line to follow through on. Maybe a bit too convenient, as scum-you would of course know full well that Conman is in fact scum and would be able to manufacture just such an attack to make someone defending him look bad and gain town cred for yourself. I'm not going to be so cruel as to discount the possibility that you were simply spot-on about Conman, but again, I am leaning somewhat towards contrivance here.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4617130#p4617130\" class=\"postlink\">post 692</a>, Slandaar wrote:</cite>Dex ignored him asking the question which is suspect to say the least.</div></blockquote><br><br>This I agree with, and I would very much like an answer to that question, but since you mention it I would also like you to address the points I raised re you in that same post."}

You said he ignored this issue entirely, which is what I was refuting with a simple example of him not ignoring it. You're moving the goalposts here, but fine, I'll play along as it's still an interesting issue. In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4557576#p4557576\" class=\"postlink\">#496</a> it seems d3x is frustrated with Conman's behavior and even asks him to replace out, so obviously he is attributing Conman's behavior to VI town rather than scum, as you have so diligently pointed out that he did. Your argument therefore seems to be that at this point town d3x 'should' have become suspicious of Conman for his behavior, which I don't agree with. One thing I would like to point out here is that there was a bunch of other people not exactly jumping on Conman for not answering questions and basically being what he was, so why is d3x scummy for this? At least he tried to make some sense of the guy. <br><br>Heck, let's make this simple by you simply explaining what you think town-d3x should have done differently.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4625197#p4625197\" class=\"postlink\">post 719</a>, Slandaar wrote:</cite>Eh you were both basically sheeping Dex from what I could tell so he basically sheeped him also; nitpicking.<br><br>Him voting later when he had the chance earlier is probably because he wouldn't just hop on straight away with his buddy needs at least one town vote...</div></blockquote><br><br>OK, I admit it might be nitpicking but it's good to discuss what exactly what was going on and get some reactions to it.

In the spirit of full honesty, I was actually getting a little worried that I might have been getting a bit too certain about my town read on d3x and my scum read on you so I decided to reread you both thoroughly, and wouldn't you know it, I missed that little gem of his which was very similar to what I had picked on you for earlier - so I posted this not least in the interest of fairness and to prove that I wasn't tunneling on you while defending d3x hard, which definitely might have made me look bad later, especially if you turn out to be town and d3x scum. <br><br>It's certainly a funny cooincidence that I seem to have done this at pretty much exactly the right moment to give you some second thoughts about the d3x/Gorgon case you were building, which by the way is exactly what I thought you might be doing, town or scum - but something about that comment about you being annoyed at my timing seems quite townish to me (I guess it might be that you're expressing some real doubts for the first time, which is always townish when it seems genuine), and the same goes for a lot of your other reactions to my questions and comments.<br><br>So, I think the right thing to do now is ...<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: </span><br><br>Back to the drawing board for me, I guess."}

Given the info I had at hand it was the right move at the time. Regardless of Conman's alignment (which I had very few reasons to know much about for sure though statistics this early in the game say any given player is more likely to be town than scum unless he does something ridiculously scummy) such a short first day would have left us with very limited information on day 2.

My unvote was on page 4, and my Slandaar vote was on page 17. The Conman lynch then happened on page 21, so that's about 5 pages of me riding the Slandaar wagon and about 13 pages of me not doing it. Or putting it in post terms, 5 posts vs. 14. How about you address the actual content of my post in a wider context instead of just reading around Conman looking for partners? That's fine per se but pretty unreliable all on its own with no further backup."}

I don't really see the cons for at least one mason to claim as soon as today, as masons can't be blocked and can't really be killed unless scum successfully play WIFOM against a very possible doc. It's more of a headache than a benefit for scum, really, and a clear benefit for town; knowing about at least one live person that can be trusted. One possible con is of course that nobody would vote that player so no info from that could be gained, but I think it's a fair tradeoff at this point in the game."}

Or to put it another way, I'm asking Slandaar how he reconciles the notion that Conman has a Town read on him simply b/c he's not Voting:Conman {as Slandaar suggests in p643}, when Slandaar doesn't say anything about changing his read, just his Vote.<br><br>I think that about does it.

After his original post, he still had 4 days to lurk until deadline, which would have meant he would have gotten prodded. He couldn't pop up in thread after qwints told him to vote conman without explaining why he wouldn't, and if he didn't show up in thread, he would be a huge suspect after he got prodded and avoided the conman lynch altogether.

As town or scum, it makes no sense not to jump on someone's counterwagon so close to deadline when it's essentially a choice between you or the counterwagon, unless you know that person's alignment for sure. I don't know why Slandaar keeps pushing his vanity wagon even though the entire game pretty much disagrees with him.

For a while I thought it was such a weak and unconvicing tangent that it reeked of a manufactured case to look like he was being proactive and making a case of his own, which is why I voted him (twice now), but as can be seen by my unvote I'm now leaning more town on him now."}

That he was only playing this one game is irrelevant. D3x's case about absta's reasons for flaking out of this game is pretty well reasoned and consistent with his thoughts on the matter back in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4557576#p4557576\" class=\"postlink\">#496</a>, and I agree with him that a comparison with Slandaar's Meph flake case is unwarranted. While I can actually see some merit in the latter case it's not very fair to refuse to acknowledge that the fact that Meph flaked out completely and silently while absta did anything but that is a relevant factor."}

The roleblock actually functions as an investigation now that there seems to be just one scum left. No mafia kill -&gt; blocked player is probably scum.<br><br>I have been thinking that based on what Kthx has said today he would probably want to vig me tonight if SiN gets lynched (which seems most likely and makes the most sense today IMO, although I must say that from rereading D1 he still looks pretty town on that day, but his later play is not nearly as solid) and turns out to be town - so I have been preparing a defense explaining what makes me unlikely scum that I might post eventually, but then I thought that the best defense is always offense. So this is what I was thinking along those lines ...<br><br>I'm not quite sure who is scum if it's not SiN although it seems obvious now that it's highly likely that it's one of Slandaar, d3x, and rofl (in that order of likelihood the way I see it). But killing one of d3x or Slandaar makes a lot of tactical sense since three outcomes are possible:<br><br>1) The killed player is scum. Yay.<br>2) They are both town. The one who didn't get killed stops tunneling on the other and can make himself useful in other more fruitful ways.<br>3) The surviving player is scum. He then can no longer hide under the smokescreen of tunneling on the killed player.<br><br>I don't think it makes much of a difference in the long run who is vigged tonight though, since I think there is very little chance that town loses no matter how this plays out. But that's no reason not to play it as optimally as possible."}

It pushed Kthx away from Slandaar and I like to that believe that my push against qwints had a lot to do with him ending up getting lynched. He was getting away with lurking and not answering important questions and I spotted it and kept the case going. Of course, as scum I could not have predicted, for instance, that he would keep ignoring me - but there still would always have been leeway for me to play this more tactically, such as not pushing that hard, lurking a bit more or like, you know, not explicitly defending others from getting lynched.<br><br>I am a pretty risk averse guy and I am pretty sure that I would never have done what I did as scum.

The Odd Night Vig and JoaT NKs were intended to create the illusion of an SK.  The mason Gunsmith shot was intended to add to that too whilst being able to clear a vig claim.  The mafia having only a BP and a goon in the group at first was to add to that illusion for the scumteam too.  Although Slandaar ended up joining the QT at the end of N1 anyways <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\">.<br><br>I wanted the masons for a subversion of knowledge element that masons/ICs bring (alongside the illusion of an SK and the scumteam not knowing about the Traitor).  <br><br>Mason/Mason/OddVig/JoaT were all fairly confirmable roles since the masons can claim relatively safely and the Vig/JoaT have an NK to 'prove' themselves.  Masons and Vig shots don't gel super well (obviously), ESPECIALLY with a BP scum out there to eliminate 1/3 of the good Vig targets.  The JoaT was intended to round out that slightly conflicting power with an RB (strong because it cant affect the masons, or even the Odd Vig on N2), a 1 shot investigate, and a 3rd way for the town to kill.  I felt the extra vig shot was important because vig shots are only really effective when you can get 2 successful ones to achieve odds.  (Or 1 and a block).  So the extra vig shot gave 3ish potential vig shots so that the town could put itself at odds fairly reliably and get the full benefit of a vig entity despite the scum having a counter to it.<br><br>Originally I wanted the mafia goon to be a rolecop and one of the masons to ALSO be an odd night watcher.  I also had the JoaT's RB as a 1xCommute originally.<br><br>The Mason/Watcher was deemed fairly non normal in review and turned to a regular mason.  Also axed the Rolecop for balance at that point.  But then it was decided the town was a little underpowered since mason/odd vig/(commute/gs/vig shot) didn't really flow together very well, so the commute was swapped for an RB that could also help control evens/odds and provided a moderately powerful shot without affecting any other town roles negatively.  I was originally tickled by the benefit that the mafia rolecop role could get from finding the traitor for the mafia team before he would join the QT.<br><br>EDIT: Dead QT. <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.quicktopic.com/48/H/vEyTJYjCfEkw\">http://www.quicktopic.com/48/H/vEyTJYjCfEkw</a><!-- m --><br>Mason QT. <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.quicktopic.com/48/H/fDQhmHXW4iEu9\">http://www.quicktopic.com/48/H/fDQhmHXW4iEu9</a><!-- m --><br>Scum QT. <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.quicktopic.com/48/H/fSiJjqNCZL75d\">http://www.quicktopic.com/48/H/fSiJjqNCZL75d</a><!-- m -->"}
