{"forum": "53", "thread": "64916", "pagelink": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=64916&start=0", "number": "1", "timestamp": "Sat Jan 09, 2016 2:49 am", "user": "Dierfire", "content": "<div style=\"text-align: center\">RULES</div><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">General</span></span><br>01. All site-wide rules apply. They may be found <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=6470\" class=\"postlink\">here</a> for reference.<br>02. I will deal with any violations of these rules as I think appropriate, including by replacing a player or by removing a player from the game (in which case the player will be declared to have lost regardless of prior win conditions). I will consult with site leadership as necessary to ensure appropriate responses to rule violations.<br>03. I have written these rules with the intent that they will cover all foreseeable situations. However, it is possible that I may have overlooked something, and the rules are subject to change at my discretion to correct any such errors. Should any changes be implemented, they will be announced in the same format as the original rule (for example, changes to the main set of rules will be announced in the main thread; changes to role-specific rules will be sent by PM).<br>04. Pretending to violate any of these rules will be treated the same as an actual violation.<br>05. In the event that I make an error, please call it to my attention by PM or by addressing me in the relevant thread (I will look for \u201c@Mod\u201d).<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Posting</span></span><br>06. Players should not discuss this game in any channels other than those I have provided.<br>07. Players should not use any form of hidden or encoded text. Players should use English exclusively.<br>08. Once I have declared a player to be dead, that player should not post in the main thread until I have declared the game to be over.<br>09. Players should not provide direct quotations from, images of, or other provable references to any game-related PM or PT.<br>10. Players may not use any form of provable randomness for any reason.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Timing</span></span><br>11. Each Day Phase will last 10 days. Each Night Phase will last 48 hours. In between, there will be a period not to exceed 24 hours for me to write the transition.<br>12. Players who have not posted in 48 consecutive hours will receive a prod. After receiving a prod, a player has 24 hours to post before I will begin seeking a replacement.<br>13. If a player being replaced for inactivity should return to the game before a replacement is found, that player may be allowed to continue in the game at my discretion. However, once a player has been replaced, that player may not continue in the game.<br>14. Players on V/LA will be exempt from the prod requirements above. However, if a player requires an extensive period of V/LA, I may determine that the game would be better served by a replacement and replace that player at my discretion.<br>15. Deadlines may be extended at my discretion as necessary to ensure that the game continues smoothly. Any such extension will be announced in the main thread.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Day Phase</span></span><br>16. Players may vote to lynch another player using either vote tags or bold tags as demonstrated below.<br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Name</span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: Name</span><br>17. In order to be counted votes should appear on a separate line and not within spoiler tags or otherwise concealed. Votes not following this format may be counted if I believe that a vote was intended.<br>18. When one player has achieved a majority of votes (more living players voting for that player than living players not voting for that player), that player will be lynched and the phase will end. If the deadline is reached before a lynch is achieved, no player will be lynched.<br>19. Players may vote to end the phase without a lynch. An example of such a vote is given below:<br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: No Lynch</span><br>If the number of living players voting for this option is greater than or equal to the number of living players not voting for this option, the phase will end without a lynch and the game will proceed directly to Night Phase.<br>20. Players may continue to post in the main thread until I have announced the end of the phase, regardless of whether or not a lynch has occurred.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Miscellaneous</span></span><br>21. Players should not edit or delete their posts. I will fix formatting errors upon request.<br>22. Players should not attempt to impersonate me in any way.<br>23. Everyone is here to have fun, and I hope that we will all keep this in mind throughout the game. Please contact me directly (by PM) with any problems or questions.<br>24. In addition to the site-wide rules, it may be useful to review the <a href=\"http://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Normal_Game\" class=\"postlink\">Normal Game guidelines</a> and the <a href=\"http://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Natural_Action_Resolution/Normal_Game\" class=\"postlink\">Natural Action Resolution guidelines</a>.<br>25. At least one player will receive the following role:<br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Welcome, (name), to Mini 1755!<br><br>Your role is: Vanilla Town, aligned with <span style=\"color: green\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Town</span></span>.<br>Abilities: You have no special abilities.<br>Win Conditions: You win if all living players are aligned with Town.</div></blockquote>"}

Though, to put it another way, at the time, your question made me suspicious of you and you were the only person who did anything that was suspicious to me.<br><br>Therefore, since no one else was suspicious to me, you were my top suspect.<br><br>I did not vote you for a few reasons: 1) We're still in RVS 2) Voting shows that you strongly believe someone is scum. I didn't strongly believe you were scum; I simply felt more suspicious of you versus everyone else. 3) It isn't a good thing to constantly be changing our votes. Since I had miniscule evidence suggesting you were scum, it wan't worth the effort.<br><br>Now, I voted Keyser for a few reasons: 1) He did seem to be rreally defending you. I found it a bit suspicious. 2) Combined with my suspicion of you, it did make you two seem like scum partners.<br><br>Finally, I have yet to unvote Keyser because I don't have a lot of reads. When I get more reads and find someone who is more deserving of a vote, I will probably change votes.<br><br>So far, my reads are as follows:<br><br>Lean Scum (Very Weak) - Keyser, Axle -- I've explained myself<br>Lean Town (Weak) - AI -- His joking attitude is actually town-indicative. I don't thing too many scums are as carefree as he is acting right now."}

I think there's a misunderstanding between Heat and me. The reason why I sugget PL Pisskop was because he was unpleasant and self-voted. As explained in my first game here, self-voting is objectively bad and good evidence of scum. I did not vote because I am wary of mislynches. Which, in Newbie 1666, you will be able to see I tend to err on the cautious side of things. Not to mention that we had three mislynches in a row that game (Zombie, who self-voted, Jake, who was being stubborn and uncooperative, and myself, because we were in lylo and there was lke a wall between me and DoTA who was town.) My reaction is normal.<br><br>2.

I get that he might be unsure if he actually reads scum or not, however I feel like getting us all to agree to a PL is a great way to get a lynch and a way out of suspicion if PK were to flip town. I do like his response to Heat's thoughts on him, seemed rational.<br><br>Heat wants to know about AI's read list and reasons for it, but isn't giving one himself. Actually, he's only responded to Keyser's reads after Keyser directly asked him about it when trying to get him to engage more.

Would you like to give us your reads and explanations for them?<br><br>I like Keyser for town. He asks proactive questions, and actively tries to engage people (Heat, PK). I really like his interactions with PK. They're more productive than most people's have been, as he's not just feeding into PK's bad attitude.<br><br>I believe Pisskop is just fishing for reactions tbh.

If we Policy Lynch like Ircher is suggesting, he may flip town and we\u2019re already down on day 1, which isn't a good start.

I know scum can counterwagon to save one of their own but I'm not sure if everytime you say it you mean it's meant in that specific way or in a more general sense.

Ircher was really bad because he was complicit in the wagon and actively supporting it from the side without committing. It's a weird thing to believe because if he was actually indifferent I think he wouldn't say much about it, and if he wanted it he would vote and take responsibility. Deus isn't so good for wanting to policy but he's automatically better than Ircher because he commits and I can believe he's being honest and he believes in what he's doing."}

The more recent one, I was 1-shot BP (note that everyone had a PR) and town lost in lylo. The other was never finished and I was a 1-shot BP (again, everyone had a pr). I had died N1 from getting shot by both the vig and the scum. Anyway, if you haven't figured it out, the rules are a lot more casual, and there is way less discussion. My first game on this site prob. has double the number of words those two games combined had.

Some go so far as to be reluctant to vote at all ,and yet are town. If you had <span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"font-style: italic\">tendencies in that direction</span></span>, that could lead you to have a tendency to jump at being by surprise on wagon of substance when you started with an RVS. My reading of your meta indicates you as a player are totally willing to pressure players early D1 and are comfortable with them being on L-1. That read is despite me seeing that you were basically LOL hammered during RVS in a completed game. So no I dont get that you are by nature a player that would jump in surprise as town like that.

I prob. wouldn't be suspicious of this post except for the fact that my page 2 behavior seems to warrant an automatic vote.

Neither you nor Ras has explained the alarm bells. Personally, I don't see the huge problem with those posts.<br><br>5. Maybe I'm not explaining well, but Droog just didn't get me when he wrote <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7570896#p7570896\">430</a>. - <span style=\"font-style: italic\"> \"what you have is me saying your entrance was scummy and if you werent experienced i wouldve voted on it\" - Exactly. I'm fine with the former, but find the latter oportunistic.</span><br><br>6. In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7570910#p7570910\">432</a>, Droog misinterprets my wish to hear other people's thoughts as an attempt to get confirmation to switch votes to Ras. - <span style=\"font-style: italic\">First of all, you completely missed the motive of my post. Which means, you're either ignorant, scum misleading town, or I am doing a poor job expressing my thoughts. Second of all, you claim I am trying to get permission to change votes. Do you take me to be an idiot? I am well aware I do not need permission to change votes. Third, the longer the day, the better for town, as ton can get more info. So, rather than stay on the Ras wagon and lynch probable scum, I take the time to switch focus to another person and attempt to find the other scum. Bearing this in mind, I always know that if deadline is near, I can always switch to the Ras wagon. My post was completely town motivated. I see this as another post attempting to mislead town.</span><br><br>7. Consensus is necessary to arrive at the right conclusions. Although, I could've worded that response post a little better. See point #6.<br><br>8. In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7571098#p7571098\">437</a>, you decide to vote ,e at <span class=\"noboldsig\">12:11 AM</span> my time complaining I had not answered your concerns despite the fact that I specifically stated \"I will post my case tommorrow\". Give me time to answer - <span style=\"font-style: italic\">I understand your arguments, but the timing of your vote is rather unreasonable.</span><br><br>9. In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7571920#p7571920\">449</a>, you attack AI for \"whiteknighting\" me. - <span style=\"font-style: italic\">No problem with that part but there is something else I want to address here. You state I am not the perfect town read. I completely agree with you on that. But, let me ask you, are you the perfect? I think not. Do you make mistakes? I'm sure you do even if you don't admit to it. Therefore, AI is using my meta (as he played a game with me) as the basis of his read of me. If AI thought I was being inconsistent in my play style, he'd prob. call me out on it. Here, A is simply saying that ya'll haven't provided enough AI enough evidence to show I am scum. You accuse me of doing the same thing to you, so why don't you present a case on me yourself? (Note - I nullread this post)</span><br><br>10. Last point: your slot got replaced. While not necessarily alignment indicative, it does add some weight to my scumread of you.<br><br><br>I will admit I kinda exaggerated when I had said I'd nail Droog, but nonetheless, this is my ISO on Droog and why I think we should lynch him."}

I'm unsure of whether or not this is his style of playing but nonetheless, it's not useful. <br>- Interestingly, at one point he votes himself. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7555337#p7555337\">#100</a>. Self-resignation? Creating a negative view(maybe that is what he wants) but regardless, my current view of him is definitely leaning towards scum/null. I'd be surprised if anybody ACTUALLY thought he was a town member with that post. Maybe that is just his style, idk.<br>- This conflict between PK and AI is quite interesting.

She breaks down and analyses what has been going. She states concisely that AI jumped onto the PK wagon and Keyser sheeps. PK at this point gives up, self-votes and Ircher wants to lynch him on his bad attitude. <br>       - Analysis and summary of what happened. PK has had no post with substance other than one or two maybe, maybe he wanted to see the reaction of town? She explains that we're put in a bad situation if we PL him and flips town, or we leave him and he continues with the lack of substance. <br>       - Agree with the idea that we're put in a bad spot if we PL him and he does flip town?

He was scummy in his flipflop on it, though it isn't unbelievable that he would change his mind I think he bailed WAY too early and I'm not sure how serious he was about it to begin with from that move. I guess he just wanted some credit for doing something? Right after he unvotes ircher PK becomes scummy for him again and we have the glorious reads list in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7572980#p7572980\">542</a> which I'm not in again. Boonskiies is even in there as (lurksakc) so I'm thinking its intentional, but I don't see how withholding information would help town. His case on performer is pretty bad and it seems retaliatory considering he was townreading him just before, it does show he can try to find things that can be seen as scummy if he feels the motivation to but he just doesn't seem interested in it if he isn't in threat. I feel like he could be an SK or otherwise neutral if there was one, rather than seeming entirely mafia I'm just finding it hard to believe he has a town wincon here."}

I reread some things, and decided to see if I could get a reaction out of him as to maybe lend some insight into his thought process. He has been defending Ircher all game, no great reasons why. So, I decided to put pressure on Ircher to see 1) how he would react and 2) if he would give any more insight as to why he\u2019s so sure Ircher is town.<br><br>He dodges getting asked about his reads on me by PK, decides Droog is town, and moves his vote off of me to pressure Boon.

The thing with voting people for low activity is you're pretty much admitting it's a shallow wagon and out of annoyance or to get them to post rather than alignment indicative reasoning.

The most depth I saw from you was early in the game and since then you've actually put almost no critical thought into finding actual scum, and rather seem to settle for whatever's easy. Posting without scumhunting is called active lurking and it's worse than inactivity because I know you were here and aren't that invested whereas a lurker is often actually busy."}

I had originally had a town lean on AI, but I thought more about it, and the fact that he won't answer questions is off putting, as is his defense for someone from pretty much the beginning who he shouldn't \"know\" is town. So I had moved him down to a scum lean, along with Ircher by association. As for your question, I had moved them to a null town.

He comes in as the 4th man on my wagon (though sort of 5th as ircher had just switched to droog for a while at the time), which is involved but not a focus point as the l-1 or a later hammer-decider would be. I think it's BS how he tried to twist my intentions (trying to paint my RVS as scummy which is absurd, and also assuming that me not liking the PK wagon = must have strong townread on him despite statements to the contrary) and justifies his vote with meta despite it all being ongoing-game and not much of it either. Overall I hate his primary tool of reading everyone being meta (see: his conclusion on ircher, PK, and me) which isn't something that people can really engage over, and his wishy-washy focus. I feel he's been involved in pretty much every going-on in the thread but his actual actions feel half-hearted and weak. My concern is that the weirdness I feel in his posts is partially from his quirks as a player and I might be going too hard on him for that. Medium Scumlean.<br><br>Ircher + AI<br>My previously made points on Ircher all still stand. What spooked me off the Ircher wagon was the Ircher &lt;-&gt; AI interaction, recently reinforced. Yeah, AI's hard defended Ircher all game from a level of confidence that doesn't match his reasoning (a shared game and no idea of what scumIrcher looks like). But now in addition Ircher is saying he gut-reads AI despite not liking his posts and its based on something that'd be \"prob. be best I didn't say.\", which is kind of fishy. I don't think being in a scumteam would explain this behaviour, I get the feeling they're in a neighbourhood or something else is going on I can't understand. I don't feel as comfortable with this as before though at this rate I don't think I'll get what I want anyways.<br><br>Droog<br>Hasn't changed particularly much from the null-scum earlier (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7574391#p7574391\">610</a>). Since then, he admits I wasn't on his reads lists for lack of impression one way or another but soon after states he'd be down joining the wagon on me so that's meh. I haven't looked into the performer case and wagon so I'll reserve judgement on that, but I do remember previous to his scumread him saying everything on the page by performer was town which is funny. Still a weak read to do anything but I'd take this wagon over one on a townread or me.<br><br>I'm going to bed now. Keyser if you can summarize your reasons for voting me again it would be appreciated, I know the other people who are voting me thoughts pretty well but I'm thinking you have a decent chance at being town."}

Instead, she put forth a thoughtful post about her understanding of his wagon. Though I only have 1 meta on her (when she was a Goon), she\u2019s looking different than her scum play in this game.

Deus was a slot that substantial detective work was coming from, and his vote on pk during pk\u2019s interaction with him to post more, looked like honest scumhunting from Deus.

However, he didn\u2019t constructively criticize town  in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7562846#p7562846\">270</a>. Yet in linked post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7557723#p7557723\">170</a>, he\u2019s trying to help us better figure out AI\u2019s alignment\u2026and seems genuinely frustrated about AI being scum. <br><br>Later he posts this to droog, which comes off very strange to me: \u201cThen vote. Id love to 1v1 you. You arent good enough to beat me.\u201d<br><br>I'm townreading him. He's much more involved here, than when he's scum. When he was scum against PantherPunt and scum against me, he posted extremely brief posts that didn't dig deeper than the surface. He was still posting very much but the depth of his posts weren't apparent in those games, when he was scum.

Definitely will try to get a good read on this slot over the night and on D2.<br>8. Performer - This is one of my weaker reads.

Massive - My weakest read right now. This guy, I don't really understand. As far as I can tell, he hasn't contributed anything useful, and he has barely participated in the game. While Massive (seems) to have a habit of leaving on weekends, he didn't tell anyone, not even the mod. He assumed his meta was sufficient to explain his absence from the game. Imo, that's just wrong. Oh, and speaking of meta, he seems to assume that his meta is enough for anyone to read his alignment. Sounds to me like a scummy excuse to not participate in the game. I haven't read his meta (and prob. won't), but I'm pretty sure it is not that clear cut as he assumes. <span class=\"noboldsig\">FoS Massive</span><br>10. Boonskies - To be truthful, aside from his case against me, he hasn't really acted scummy. BUT, his case against me is extremely exaggerated and doesn't seem very genuine to me. Even after pointing out that I wasn't wagon hopping by actually quoting vc's as proof, he didn't seem to believe me. It could be Confirmation Bias on his end, but I think its prob. more scum-related motives trying to frame me.<br></span></span><br><span style=\"color: #DD3000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Likely Scum</span> - In Order<br>11.

I'm not really beliving her alibi either. I'll reevaluate my read though in my Night review of the thread.<br>12. AlwaysInnocent - Well, it seems that AI has gione from an early likely town read to my currently highest scumread....<br><br>First of all, I will explain my \"gut\" read of AI that I earlier stated \"prob. be best I didn't say\". To begin with, when I made that statement, I was trying to avoid giving the scum more reasons to lynch me. Anyway, it boils down to three things: 1) (The oart that I didn't want to share) Confirmation Bias that AI is town (is that proper usage?) and 2) AI has posted way more this game than he did in Newbie 1666 as scum. and 3) AI was defending me. (Another thing I really didn't want to share then).<br><br>So, even that aside, why is AI now my top scum read? I've thought about AI's interactions, and they don't seem to be town motivated:<br><br>Refusing to answer questions? Check.<br>Buddying up to a townie to try to get that townie avoid lynching you? Check.<br>Providing very vague and terse reasons for scumreads? Check.<br>Not really scumhunting? Check.<br><br>I am convinced that AI is not really helping the town and the few useful things he has said seem to be more opportunistic and fabricated rather than town-motivated and genuine.

This led me to get questioned by Keyser due to the way I worded the post (more likely, the statement was a typo -- I type stuff and don't bother checking).

I will admit, D1 is early for a PL suggestion, but later along the line, if the player in question persists (and isn't replaced), then he/she will eventually get lynched as people find irritable players scummier than other players (at least that's how I see it).

In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7572774#p7572774\">504</a>, AI merely shrugs when Performer brings up a question to him. - <span style=\"font-style: italic\">This just jumps out as anti-town... - <span class=\"noboldsig\">Scum-Indicative</span></span><br><br>38. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7572842#p7572842\">517</a> is a good catch by Droog - Performer finds it scummy when I switch from Ras to Droog yet does the same thing himself. -- <span style=\"font-style: italic\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Null-Indicative but weakens Performer Town-Read</span></span><br><br>39.

The Droog vs Pisskop fight on page 22 strikes me as <span class=\"noboldsig\">Townie vs.\u00a0 Townie.</span><br><br>41. Starting at <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7573002#p7573002\">548</a>, Golden shares his thoughts on some players. - [i]Nothing really seems fabricated here - <span class=\"noboldsig\">Null-Town Indicative</span></span><br><br>42. In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7573060#p7573060\">556</a>, Pisskop lists a few points against Droog and says in the next post that it is ironic on so many levels. - <span style=\"font-style: italic\">I see nothing ironic in what Droog has said and what you posted in the list. Droog is definitely not a troll - <span class=\"noboldsig\">Null-Scum Indicative</span></span><br><br>43. I like how <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7573114#p7573114\">568</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7573115#p7573115\">569</a> by Droog both just say \"(That was sarcasm). - <span style=\"font-style: italic\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Null-Indicative</span></span><br><br>44. Why does the mod feel a need to bump the thread every so often? Like in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7573131#p7573131\">574</a><br><br>45. In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7545612#p7545612\">676</a>, UTL states he voted me as a reaction test for AI. - <span style=\"font-style: italic\">I really find this ridiculous - <span class=\"noboldsig\">Scum-Indicative</span></span><br><br>46. In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7577325#p7577325\">699</a>, Boon accuses me of wagon-hopping. - <span style=\"font-style: italic\">As I have proven, that is not the case, but rather, I am considering other possibilities while we still got time in D1. Aka, I am trying to get reads on other people, so I'm better equipped for D2 - <span class=\"noboldsig\">Scum-Indicative</span></span><br><br>(The next series will probably be all about Boon)<br><br>47. Boon somehow takes <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7575902#p7575902\">664</a> as a scumslip in\u00a0 <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7577332#p7577332\">702</a>. - <span style=\"font-style: italic\">Am I not allowed to have fun like AI and Pisskop have basically been doing the entire game? - <span class=\"noboldsig\">Scum-Indicative</span></span><br><br>48.

Second of all, since when has saying you do not want to lynch someone D1 become budding/WK.

I hate to admit it, but Ras's analysis of me in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7578207#p7578207\">723</a> was fairly accurate.<br><br>52. In post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7578338#p7578338\">730</a> by Boon, Boon considers my <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7578422#p7578422\">732</a> as me admitting I'm scum. - <span style=\"font-style: italic\">At the very least, I'm pretty sure Boon is guilty of confirmation bias against me here. - <span class=\"noboldsig\">Null-Indicative</span></span><br><br>53. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7578207#p7578207\">723</a> is interesting... - <span style=\"font-style: italic\">I scumread Massive for this.... - <span class=\"noboldsig\">Very Scum-Indicative</span></span><br><br>54.

And how was Ras in your town pool???<br><br>55. I'm seeing a probable association between <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Performer</span> and Ras on page 32.<br><br>56. I'm not buying UTL's explanation in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7584016#p7584016\">804</a><br><br>57.

He then calls Droog's hammer \"scummy ****\". I see no problems with Droog's hammer -- no one can stay up for 24 hrs ad we were only 6 or less hours to deadline.

Golden Robster - Between Deus and him, they haven't posted much which is the main reason this is a lean read. The posts Golden have made are reasonable and seem thought-out.<br>5. Pisskop - I've reconsidered my read here. He does seem to be contributing to the town but my earlier read of his gameplay style I think is somewhat invalid. It seems this is how he always plays.<br>6.

Definitely haven't see anything very towny from this slot. He could start by being more active. He could also stop assuming that 1) everyone will read his meta and 2) his alignment is easy to discern. Finally, he should really communicate with the mod if he's going to be absent; just cuz his meta says he doesn't play on weekends doesn't mean everyone will know that.

Ircher - Role PM</span></span><br><span style=\"color: #40FF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Likely Town</span> - In Order<br>2. Keyser S\u00f6ze - Definitely my strongest read aside from myself<br>3. Pisskop - Along with what other people have commented on Pisskop's behavior, I think there's a 90% chance Pisskop is town.<br></span></span><br><span style=\"color: #90FF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Leaning Town</span> - In Order<br>4. Golden Robster - Nothing sticks out from here, but I would like more from the slot.<br>5. AxleGreaser - I would say that he is very commited to the game and is genuinely trying to find scum. The way he approaches stuff I definitely like. Still, I think there is a good margin of error here.<br>6. Droog - He is fairly active and seems to be actively trying to solve the game.<br></span></span><br><span style=\"color: #FFAA00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Neutral</span> - In Order<br>7. Heat - I really haven't had a good chance to update my read of him. Still, I think my earlier scumread of him was personal reasons. Definitely will try to get a good read on this slot over the night and on D2.<br>8. Performer - This is one of my weaker reads. He had a great start, then seemed to just like vanish from the game, and then around deadline, he's back but plays in a way that is scummy. <span class=\"noboldsig\">FoS Performer</span><br></span></span><br><span style=\"color: #CC7000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Leaning Scum</span> - In Order<br>9. Massive - My weakest read right now. This guy, I don't really understand. As far as I can tell, he hasn't contributed anything useful, and he has barely participated in the game. While Massive (seems) to have a habit of leaving on weekends, he didn't tell anyone, not even the mod. He assumed his meta was sufficient to explain his absence from the game. Imo, that's just wrong. Oh, and speaking of meta, he seems to assume that his meta is enough for anyone to read his alignment. Sounds to me like a scummy excuse to not participate in the game. I haven't read his meta (and prob. won't), but I'm pretty sure it is not that clear cut as he assumes. <span class=\"noboldsig\">FoS Massive</span><br>10. Boonskies - To be truthful, aside from his case against me, he hasn't really acted scummy. BUT, his case against me is extremely exaggerated and doesn't seem very genuine to me. Even after pointing out that I wasn't wagon hopping by actually quoting vc's as proof, he didn't seem to believe me. It could be Confirmation Bias on his end, but I think its prob. more scum-related motives trying to frame me.<br></span></span><br><span style=\"color: #DD3000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Likely Scum</span> - In Order<br>11. UpTooLate - First of all, I'm starting to believe what others have said about her. As Keyser pointed out, her \"reaction test\" of me was not only ineffective, but also rather far-fetched. I'm not really beliving her alibi either. I'll reevaluate my read though in my Night review of the thread.<br>12. AlwaysInnocent - Well, it seems that AI has gione from an early likely town read to my currently highest scumread....<br><br>First of all, I will explain my \"gut\" read of AI that I earlier stated \"prob. be best I didn't say\". To begin with, when I made that statement, I was trying to avoid giving the scum more reasons to lynch me. Anyway, it boils down to three things: 1) (The oart that I didn't want to share) Confirmation Bias that AI is town (is that proper usage?) and 2) AI has posted way more this game than he did in Newbie 1666 as scum. and 3) AI was defending me. (Another thing I really didn't want to share then).<br><br>So, even that aside, why is AI now my top scum read? I've thought about AI's interactions, and they don't seem to be town motivated:<br><br>Refusing to answer questions? Check.<br>Buddying up to a townie to try to get that townie avoid lynching you? Check.<br>Providing very vague and terse reasons for scumreads? Check.<br>Not really scumhunting? Check.<br><br>I am convinced that AI is not really helping the town and the few useful things he has said seem to be more opportunistic and fabricated rather than town-motivated and genuine. I definitely need to sort this slot out D2. <span class=\"noboldsig\">FoS AI</span><br></span></span><br><span style=\"color: #AAAAAA\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Watch List:</span> - People who I need to keep a close eye on:<br>1.

It could be Confirmation Bias on his end, but I think its prob. more scum-related motives trying to frame me.<br></span></span><br><span style=\"color: #DD3000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Likely Scum</span> - In Order<br>11. UpTooLate - First of all, I'm starting to believe what others have said about her. As Keyser pointed out, her \"reaction test\" of me was not only ineffective, but also rather far-fetched. I'm not really beliving her alibi either. I'll reevaluate my read though in my Night review of the thread.<br>12. AlwaysInnocent - Well, it seems that AI has gione from an early likely town read to my currently highest scumread....<br><br>First of all, I will explain my \"gut\" read of AI that I earlier stated \"prob. be best I didn't say\". To begin with, when I made that statement, I was trying to avoid giving the scum more reasons to lynch me. Anyway, it boils down to three things: 1) (The oart that I didn't want to share) Confirmation Bias that AI is town (is that proper usage?) and 2) AI has posted way more this game than he did in Newbie 1666 as scum. and 3) AI was defending me. (Another thing I really didn't want to share then).<br><br>So, even that aside, why is AI now my top scum read? I've thought about AI's interactions, and they don't seem to be town motivated:<br><br>Refusing to answer questions? Check.<br>Buddying up to a townie to try to get that townie avoid lynching you? Check.<br>Providing very vague and terse reasons for scumreads? Check.<br>Not really scumhunting? Check.<br><br>I am convinced that AI is not really helping the town and the few useful things he has said seem to be more opportunistic and fabricated rather than town-motivated and genuine.

Maybe I was too demanding, but I'd really like more than 20 posts from him.<br><br>Basically, what I have against Massive is that he isn't allowing himself to be scrutinized; it would be impossible to get a fair read on him because there isn't enough material to consider. The fact that he has seemed to regard my request for a reads list from him as pointless is a bit strange. If we allow him to coast through this game, then we could be doomed; apparently, I'm the only who thinks he should be a bit more active, regardless of meta.<br><br>The way I see it, mods give 48 hrs before prods because sometimes you get super busy and cannot play for awhile. I see the way Massive plays as an abuse of the system: he posts only 2-3 times a weeks and is completely absent on weekends. That isn't proper in my opinion. While I don't think you shouldn't spam the thread, I also think you should stay engaged in the thread and strive to post at least once a day. I know some people have a busy schedule, but if you are so busy that you cannot post once a day regularly, I question why you signed up/haven't replaced out yet.<br><br>My biggest issue is how Massive takes the weekends off. With only 10 days to a day, that is a very efficient way (as scum) to avoid having to scumhunt and appear as town.<br><br>So, let me ask all of you:.<br><br>What has Massive done that makes you townread him?"}

This led me to get questioned by Keyser due to the way I worded the post (more likely, the statement was a typo -- I type stuff and don't bother checking). Well, I eventually cleared this up with Keyser and Axle. I did suggest a pre-flip association of Keyser and Axle, but I think that would no longer be the case.<br><br>5.

In post <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7550481#p7550481\" class=\"postlink\">27</a> by me, I make the rather confusing statement that a lot of people think Axle is the scummiest player currently in the game when I meant that I thought Axle was the scummiest player in the game based off the comments of other players. This led me to get questioned by Keyser due to the way I worded the post (more likely, the statement was a typo -- I type stuff and don't bother checking). Well, I eventually cleared this up with Keyser and Axle. I did suggest a pre-flip association of Keyser and Axle, but I think that would no longer be the case.<br><br>5.

I also see evidence that Heat doesn't fully understand how PL works. I'll put it this way: some players are so irratable that keeping them as town does more harm than conducting a PL on them. I will admit, D1 is early for a PL suggestion, but later along the line, if the player in question persists (and isn't replaced), then he/she will eventually get lynched as people find irritable players scummier than other players (at least that's how I see it).

He tends to be very analytical, sometimes to the point of paranoia. I\u2019m only speaking about his town game because I\u2019ve never seen his scum game. <br>-----<br>Ircher - <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7578224#p7578224\">726</a> touched on 4 players in a vague, ambiguous manner. Along with all the analyses on Ircher between pgs 21-30, I was not believing that slot to be town anymore. However, his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7584853#p7584853\">814</a> unvote of Ras when we were about 13 hours before d1 ended, because he was concerned about accidental hammer \u2013 looks highly Townie to me \u2013 and if anything, it looks like a rookie town move. <br><br>Heat\u2019s ISO was massively focused on Ircher on d2. Ircher was looking more likely to be rookie town by the way of his posts, saying things like the below (scumreading me for a non-scum reason) Also, he is 16. I'm thinking scum sees Ircher as an easy person to lynch because of these 2 reasons.<br>\u201cAs to your question -- It does look a desparate Performer who is doing a last minute bus of his partner. Definitely dob't think a read can change that quick.\u201d<br><br>Ircher could\u2019ve hammered me after UTL put me at L-1 on d2, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7613409#p7613409\">1086</a>. Instead in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7613909#p7613909\">1088</a>, he voted UTL so that makes me continue thinking he\u2019s town since I\u2019d think scum would go for the hammer in that situation. His willingness to push us all the way to the end of deadline, is something many new Townies and even I did, in my first town game on this site. <br>-----<br>Axle \u2013 has been trying to sort things out in his posts. His reads list of the following people looking town - I only agree with 4 of them: Kesyer, Pisskop, Droog, Massive, Ircher.<br><br>The problem with this slot though, is on d2, he\u2019s been pushing heavily on me. Not sure if this is supposed to be a trait of good town, something coming from stubborn town, or scummy. Still, I am thinking the chance of him being town are more likely than him being scum.<br>-----<br>pisskop \u2013 self voted himself on d1 \u2013 typically an anti-town move but in the context he did it for, to get some conversation going, along with his continued behavior in trying to figure things out \u2013 I\u2019m willing to give him benefit of the doubt that he\u2019s town. However, his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7562846#p7562846\">270</a> post wasn't helpful, it came off as scum AtE to me. Yet in post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7557723#p7557723\">170</a>, he\u2019s trying to help us better figure out AI\u2019s alignment\u2026and seems genuinely frustrated about thinking AI was scum. <br><br>He's much more involved here, than when he's scum. When he was scum against PantherPunt and scum against me, he posted extremely brief posts that didn't dig deeper than the surface. He was still posting very much but the depth of his posts weren't apparent in those games, when he was scum. Here, he's providing info and pressuring people.<br><br>Something that is still strange to me, was this post of his to droog: \u201cThen vote. Id love to 1v1 you. You arent good enough to beat me.\u201d<br><br><br><span style=\"color: #0080BF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Null <br></span></span><br><br>Boon \u2013 his posts since his replace-in earlier in d1, have touched on Droog/pk/Ircher. His predecessor voted pk, Boon unvoted him. His posts looked like he\u2019s just standing on the periphery regarding those 3, and his lurking to me, it was scummy.<br><br>At first his play before his first big post of d1, appeared to resemble the game where he was scum versus Keys  &amp; I.<br><br>Then his  <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7574431#p7574431\">611</a> &amp; <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7574436#p7574436\">612</a> defense against my pressure on him, actually sounded sensible to me. His scumread of Rask at the time of his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7574431#p7574431\">611</a> post , was still odd.<br><br>Another positive from Boon is that he\u2019s been consistent from d1 to d2, as represented by his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7595948#p7595948\">913</a> post in voting for his 3 scumreads between Ras/Ircher/me.<br><br>However, Boon is notorious for lurking - he even admitted it, and he lurked in the large normal I played with him and Keyser. This isn't a comfortable thought to me.<br><br>My read evolved on him and I put him at null.<br>-----<br>massive \u2013 disliked how he stated he\u2019s easy to read as every alignment. His catch-up after the weekend  on pg 30, looked like empty posting. His <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7579227#p7579227\">754</a> was alright, as he ended it with stating things that sound like typical town - sure on a few things, unsure on a few things. <br><br>Later on in d2, he posted nothing that stood out as scummy.<br><br>On d2, I went through a few of massive's scum games again, compared them to the one where him and I were town, as well as this one. He did vote Rask but he\u2019s had no vote from what I recall, on all of d2. Not certain where to sort him."}

Deus was a slot that seemed to be doing substantial detective work, and his vote on pk during pk\u2019s interaction with him to post more, looked like honest scumhunting from Deus.  <br><br>Also, Ras\u2019s <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7567859#p7567859\">392</a> about rallying votes onto Deus/Golden, made me townread Golden. But nothing even came out of that. <br><br>Golden unvoted pisskop, posted near deadline, and ended up not voting on d1. This sequence is still suspicious to me \u2013 his reason of no vote being he forgot to vote because he had an interview.<br><br>Moreso, Golden claimed to have gut townread me in his posts 906-989. Then out of nowhere, he posted in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7615091#p7615091\">1110</a> about being alright with my lynch, which is extremely scummy because of the sudden unexplained contradiction. So he\u2019s been gut townreading me and suddenly he\u2019s ok with my lynch - as if he knows I am town. He continues the passive aggressive charade for my death, with <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7615219#p7615219\">1112</a> &amp; <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7615250#p7615250\">1114</a>. massive, you recall the last time FB used \"gut\" to read people? He turned out scummy. This is a similar case with this slot, in addition - Golden is fine with my lynch . Wow. That doesn't add up to him being town.<br><br>His scumreads include Heat/UTL \u2013 he thought one of them is scum. He took all the way until his  1/29, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7614041#p7614041\">1095</a> post to say he wants more from Heat \u2013 then he stated he didn\u2019t have a chance to engage with him, yet he never followed up on engaging with Heat. Empty words.<br>-----<br>Heat - in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7597074#p7597074\">917</a>, he scumread Ircher, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7599554#p7599554\">955</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7599557#p7599557\">956</a> was the extent of his pressure on Ircher on d2. Then only 3 hours later, he unvotes Ircher. His continued desire for AI's death on d1, his vote on AI since the RVS, and the rest of his sparse ISO , doesn\u2019t add up to being town. <br>Later he replied to my pressure about his unvote of Ircher and addresses my skepticism of him leaving his vote on AI, in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7604937#p7604937\">1016</a> &amp; <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7604948#p7604948\">1017</a> \u2013 both which could easily be faked as scum. <br>On top of that, he votes me because of the \u201cspeed\u201d of UTL\u2019s wagon compared to mine, being his basis for voting me\u2026you\u2019ve got to be kidding me. That\u2019s it? <br><br>His <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7557959#p7557959\">194</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7557966#p7557966\">195</a>, and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7558905#p7558905\">205</a> interactions with Ras, could\u2019ve been Heat trying to separate association with Rask.<br>-----<br>RC/droog \u2013 his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7572729#p7572729\">493</a> reply to me was that UTL and Heat were moving to null for him, yet he thought one of them could still be scum. That doesn\u2019t follow neatly.<br><br>In the same post reply, he stated he agreed with AI more than he thought he would...which I think is a scummy excuse for creating fluff.  Later on, he added the UTL &amp; Heat 2 to his townreads, which caused me to null read him.<br><br>Then his peculiar <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7572483#p7572483\">485</a> regarding Boon, his bare agreement with AI's reads, the oddness of his posts, his erroneous scumread of me, his exclusion of Rask in the below reads list from him - I\u2019m back to scumreading droog.<br><br>Something about Rask &amp; droog's interactions about droog voting Rask, is peculiar. Rask expected droog to get called out on hammering him out of cowardice - cowardice because droog was bussing his partner, is my thought. <br><br>Then RC replaces in within 3 days of d2 deadline, but told us he hasn\u2019t caught up. The entirety of his ISO is about catching up and indecisiveness \u2013 the latter being a classic scum tell. We\u2019re so close to deadline yet the entirety of his posts are just about those 2 things. <br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>(town)<br>Keyser (same reasons as before)<br>ai (same wavelength, doesnt take pk crap)<br>axle (he gets in-depth in a way not worth faking as scum)<br>irchir (misguided but coming from the right place)<br>heat (nothing sets off alarm bells)<br>utl (ive decided my old scumtells were crap here)<br>boonskiiies (lurksakc)<br><br>pisskop<br>performer<br>(scum)</div></blockquote><br><br>Droog's read on me without any valid reasoning, his scummy reasons for townreading Heat &amp; Boon without engaging them much, and his question-mark reason for townreading UTL .  <br>-----<br>UTL - misrepresented me, UTL voted me, UTL misrepresented me again \u2013 scummy.

If you were paying attention, I said I was going to hammer hours prior to that. Somehow that doesn't factor into your argument -- you continue to leave that out. And somehow \"demanding answers from pisskop about his jump\" doesn't factor into any of your other reads, so it can't be that scummy in isolation. I'm curious how long you'll be able to ride this \"I play differently than other people on site, that's why I'm so scummy as town\" angle you're slinging. It's really ONLY the N1 kill that is preventing me from helping run you up at this point, so maybe I need to go back and reread Day 1."}

I doubted myself yesterday when I stopped pushing for ircher, and then I went Performer, even though I was more sure of Ircher, I doubted my self earlier in this day with Massive. Who are you all to accuse me of not 're-evaluating'. Massive was one of my higher town reads, yet I decided to be open to pushing him earlier. I don't see this is as scum-massive.

In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7611481#p7611481\">1062</a>, Boon demands I just vote Performer. - <span style=\"font-style: italic\">As much as I want to say this is scum trying to get players to somewhat quicklynch Performer, I just don't see that coming from Boon. It seems more likely a Boon who is just extremely frustrated with me and Performer and wants the day to end. Yes, I consider this a gut read for the most part despite the fact that I would generally think scum would encourage such behavior. - <span class=\"noboldsig\">Town-Indicative</span></span><br><br>10.

Imho, 2 sounds more plausible right now, so by Golden\"s own words -- <span class=\"noboldsig\">Very Scum Indicative</span></span><br><br>11. We need to reconsider the weight of !<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7619933#p7619933\">1147</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7619977#p7619977\">1148</a> by Performer.

When you do they frequently don't make sense to me nor do i find them persuasive.  That means that as scum your get to just shit up the thread with various theories that dont make sense to people(me) and it looks pretty much just like town RC.</fieldset><br><fieldset style=\"border:3px outset grey; padding:5px 10px\"><legend style=\"text-transform:uppercase; margin:0px 0.6em; padding:0em 0.33em\">conclusion</legend>So one conclusion is none hijacked your accoutn and you are posting pretty much like yourself, but an even more IDGAF version than usual.</fieldset></div></div></div><br><br>In a more general sense<br><br>As you are not in fact putting that reason for not lynching GR forward, it also means you are not actually trying to make sure that GR doesn't get lynched, you just want for some reason to be seen saying you oppose it, without actually making a determined push. Id point out how scummy doing that kind of thing can be, but TBMrecollection that is pretty much how you play. There do also exist towny possible reasons to adopt stance like that, and at this time I have no expressed opinion about whether you are doing like that(for a towny reason) or not. (also I have not actually drawn that conclusion, youd need to have started actually playing the game, for me to make judgments like that.)<br><br>If i was just reading your play this game your slot would have significantly different read to what Droog made of it before he left.<br><br>So pulling things in isolation like, \"RC is reluctant to vote GR, is not all that useful\", analysing or requesting analysis of points in isolation like that is bad. So that is SNAFU too.<br><br>and then there is the rest of the post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7640231#p7640231\">1624</a> that you seem to have overlooked which is Heat also scum reading GR recently<br><br>You recently suggested massive might be scum.  I have different view. One of the things he has been doing is generally known as \"Working the game out\", one of the ways i have observed him do that is he has no problem working out by reading the thread things such as:<br><br>Ircher at no point gave any indication he had a role related check. Indeed reading the thread and trying to work it out would have made it abundantly clear that was not what was going on.<br>You by way of contrast &gt;claimed&lt; not to understand that, you have effectively by your loose/bad PR related play, claimed vanilla town, go you, now your survival which apparently is way more important to you than your town wincon is greatly enhanced.  <span class=\"noboldsig\">or</span> ... that would also be &gt;&gt;consistent&lt;&lt; with a scum RC trying to establish in advance reason why they have not been night killed. That is becuase IMO RC, is so frequently sure they are so good and dangerous to scum that RC is bound to be the night kill. So as scum I expect you will frequently try and establish reasons your not dead.  But as i said I have also got the read on your slot from Droogs townier play, so that is just dripping tap material so far. <br><br>I suppose,<br>I could spoon feed you what I observed like you're a rank noob if you like?"}

Primary wagon at this time is Rask; UTL is already on the counterwagon (Ircher) at this time so why jump if scum? (The Heat wagon ultimately goes nowhere.) The follow-up in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7576998#p7576998\" class=\"postlink\">686</a> is kinda wishy-washy, like she's concerned about pressure she's receiving from AI/Keyser and that it's directly related to her scumread of Ircher.

Heat is probably even less likely than Ircher to NK AI N1 since he spent all D1 attacking him. <br><br>... I just realized I skimmed over a ton of Heat's ISO because the head changed. <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7594370#p7594370\" class=\"postlink\">880</a> is Heat's first post on D2. Like, <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7577323#p7577323\" class=\"postlink\">698</a> is fine but it's almost like Heat is a hydra and the other head started posting, and there's suddenly not a lot of content in the posts and I get to <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7611305#p7611305\" class=\"postlink\">1056</a> and was like wha huh? (Yes I realize Heat is not a hydra, what I mean is that his content changed unexpectedly, which could be to divert attention.) I do like 1056 though, did Heat follow-up on looking at AI? Nope and he forgets he already unvoted Ircher when he moves onto Performer (L-1) in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7618654#p7618654\" class=\"postlink\">1137</a> ... at this point he has mentioned Performer / interacted with Performer only once (in a joke post no less) up to listing him on par with Ircher as a scumread in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7597074#p7597074\" class=\"postlink\">917</a>?

UTL is more likely to kill AI N1 than Heat (both were being pressed by AI but UTL was trying to placate him whereas Heat was attacking back)<br><br>... UTL is more likely to be actually scumhunting; I can follow the logic in most of her reads and read changes, whereas Heat has shifts that don't track<br><br>I do think one of them is likely scum (not both) and it's a pick-em for me at this point.

One thing that I know for sure is that not a single one of us has any real idea as to where this game is going (well, that's not strictly the truth, but you get the gist). Most games have some kind of leader by this point, and if I'm not mistaken, Keyser was our leader ('least D2) and he's been nk'd and we have yet to chosen a successor.<br><br>Going back to D1, one of Rask's last posts included UTL, Axle, and Droog as the people he wanted lynch. As of right now, none of them have been lynched. Now, I'm delving in to the wifom territory, but let's consider why he wants each of these guys lynched.<br><br>If UTL is town: then it seems to me that Ras was taking advantage of the fact that a lot of people scumread him, so in essence, he was going for an easy mislynch on UTL. On the other hand, if UTL is scum, then this is an attempt to distance himself from one of his partners.<br><br>We know that for balance purposes, at least one of the people Ras listed has to be town. I'm thinking he most likely included Axle because he knew Axle was town and he knew that Axle was unlikely to be lynched. It was an attempt to cast doubt on a person who few people scumread. It had no point other than to try to make us second-guess each other.<br><br>Finally, we have Droog. Overall, I must say that I was pretty satisfied with Droog's play; however, I am rather displeased with RC's play. Nonetheless, I am thinking that RC is more likely town and that RC is following his meta that I prob. won't read. So, this slot is prob. also town.<br><br>With that being said, (this is the part that is def. subj. to fallancies), do you think that Ras would've on purposely included only players he knew were town? I think its plausible, as it would be a bit out of the normal flow and ebb of the game. People wouldn't expect it from scum as they would a mixed group.<br><br>With that being said, I think I'd prefer lynching Heat before UTL.<br><br>Last of all --&gt; What happened to the GR wagon??? RC dismantled almost the entire wagon! If we're going to lynch for info as PK suggested, I would think a Heat flip bit more informative than lynching GR.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: Golden Robster</span><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Heat</span>"}

My problem was i knew where the friendly neighbor and last power role was, so as scum has hit 3 for 3 power roles this game they might too. The value of a continuing charade seemed marginal. Also there exists the ??? possibility if PK, really denies knowledge of the PM, that boon had some kind of plan and it involved some confusion about where his PMs had gone, and for example heat picking up the vibe, acting as if they knew Boon was a FN, then boon killing everyone else and puppeting heat to victory? Well I have no idea what a highly implausible scum Boons plan might be.<br><br> But I also had a piece that didn't fit, I had believed Ircher was probably getting the I am a FN PM .<br> and now some movement, \"im not against a boon lynch\"<br><br> but that(trying to let a boon lynch go through) is also an impossible play by scum PK.</div></div></div><br><br>So to be terribly clear the straight up plain observation that Heat confirmed Boon's role, is worth pretty much nothing as that is the direct explicit largely unequivocal advice of the wiki.<br>The point of towniness is just the feel read on just how it was done and the words.<br><br>Also town reading of PK is not based on Boon not dying. Not killing boon, if you are town read and notified n1 is I believe required as the N2 notification will i believe still go out. <br>Secondly, scum nking a FN who was not heavily impacting the game like Keyser was, hints at knowledge of the role by player strongly town read.

I apparently got jumped on this a lot. - <span style=\"font-style: italic\">On reflection, my suggestion wasn't an attrocious one, and while I never committed to it but more stood on the sidelines (one way to put it), I think it's understandable. PK was annoying the heck out of me, but I really didn't feel PK was scum. Hence, the reason I didn't act proactively in my PL suggestion.</span><br><br>3. I am the first person to vocalize a scumread of Ras; I did so in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7559225#p7559225\">213</a>; furthermore, I voted Ras in that post. Really consider that before lynching me, it is prob. one of the few things that I've done in this game that kinda fits site norm.<br><br>4. Later on, I have a little clash with Droog. Upon looking back over it, my reaction was more \"Droog seems to be scumreading me for poor reasons\" rather than an actual scummy feel to it. What I am saying is that it wasn't like Droog was dropping scumtells, it was more that I found him opportunistic because he seemed to scumread me for reasons I thought were unreasonable. Am I being clear here?<br><br>5. One thing I would like to point out in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7569900#p7569900\">418</a> is the fact I <span style=\"font-style: italic\">generally</span> agreed with what Ras said. I didn't say I completely agreed, I really didn't say I mostly agreed with Ras's post that I quoted. I actually said that I agreed with the general ideas in Ras's post. Huge difference between the two imho.<br><br>6. By <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7573063#p7573063\">558</a>, I've changed from Droog to Boon. Apparently, my reasoning was AI's read and the fact that Boon was lurking. - <span style=\"font-style: italic\">First of all, I probably valued AI's opinion the most out of all of you early game; mainly because I played with him before. Next, as I later realized this game, activity truly is a null tell, but I was the mindset that if they weren't active, they were scum lurking around. In truthfulness, I ought to lynch myself based off of that reasoning as everyone gets busy at times. So, yeah, this wasn' my best move, but it could be worse -- I could just switch without any reason. And I'm sure there are worse reasons for voting him at the time than activity.<br><br>7. Boon accuses me of making fluff. In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7575803#p7575803\">659</a>, I challenge him to highlight some of it. - [i]In hindsight, the way I worded that post is kinda scummy. While the premise is reasonable, I think I could've made my challenge in a way that sounded less defensive, etc.</span><br><br>8. One thing that is notable in D1 is that of all my scumreads, I only consistently kept 1. That read was Ras -- from beginning to end, I scumread him. Why did I scumread other people, well, as a person elsewhere put it, I'm a reflexive voter. I tend to vote anyone who jumps on me cuz I think I'm not acting scummy but truly I do do things that look very culpable. Ras was the only person that day that I scumread for a reason besides activity or scumreading me. <span class=\"noboldsig\">@Ras (For Post-Game) --&gt; I am a bit disappointed. You probably could've fooled me if you tried a bit harder and stayed engaged in the game even after your crucial mistake. It was your lack of commitment, of fighting to survive, that ultimately got you lynched. Keep that in mind the next time you are scum.</span><br><br>9. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7575902#p7575902\">664</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7576042#p7576042\">667</a> are fun, joking posts that shouldn't be taken as alignment indicative.<br><br>10. Ok, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7578206#p7578206\">722</a> just sounds wrong. First of all it is a logical fallancy (not that I really care. Also, I'm hinting at a possibility of me being scum. Despite the way it sounds, I actually like the post; context is the key here. In this case, we have Boon tunnelling me hardcore. So, what I am effectively doing here is suggesting that if he would look at it at a more neutral standpoint, he may not see as much scum in me. Aka, this post is a good example where context and interpretation matter a lot --&gt; Boon thought it was scumslip which it is if you just skim over it. If you understand the context though, you will realize it is more of a post that a frustrated townie would make.<br><br>11. I remind people in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7581031#p7581031\">756</a> that deadline is approaching. - <span style=\"font-style: italic\">This is me shooting for towncred, but think about it. Scum could VERY EASILY just \"ignore\" the deadline and later pretend they didn't notice; they would IMHO prefer NOT to mention that a deadline is looming, ESPECIALLY when the obvious lynch at the time is one of their buddies. No lynch in general hurts town, and scum would PREFER no lynch over the lynch of their buddy. Just my own attempt to garner towncred, just don't all me out on it, as I'm being honest. Oh and last of all, you must always consider the sum of the actions, one little instance like this is never something you should base your entire read upon.</span><br><br>12. As I demonstrated throughout this game, I always maximize daytime if it is in my control. One such post is <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7584853#p7584853\">814</a> where I unvote Ras despite knowing that he is almost certainly the D1 lynch and there is almost no more discussion to take place. - <span style=\"font-style: italic\">I prefer if you don't take these things as alignment indicative, it is just the way I play. In general, more time imo means more time to find scum and their partners, so it is my opinion that unless the next lynch will end the game REGARDLESS of flip, time shouldn't be cut short.</span><br><br>13. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7585605#p7585605\">826</a> is my final D1 post. I made a total of 63 posts that day out of about 860 or so posts.<br><br>14. My notes in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7594344#p7594344\">877</a> are still somewhat relevant and should definitely be reviewed. One of the few times this game I've paid close attention to stuff. Some interesting things --&gt; Droog vs. PK I marked as TvT, so that furthers my PK townread. Point 19 is kinda interesting albeit no longer relevant. Still useful to consider though.<br><br>15. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7600109#p7600109\">971</a> began a mini off-topic discussion.<br><br>16. Around the <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7603156#p7603156\">1000</a>s, I'm trying to use activity to show that Massive is scummy. - <span style=\"font-style: italic\">If I were more experienced, I would probably say that most people would find that opportunistic. The thing is I'm not; I am just now starting to understand why activity is non-alignment indicative. I'm also starting to understand how meta affects reads -- that has greatly influenced my read of PK throughout the game. I never read meta, but I ought to. Just as I tend to be seen as a good mislynch target, so do other people have their own metas they follow. I really at least give them more weight than I have; sure, you can manipulate them, but that isn't normally the case and I shouldn't just flagrantly disregard it. As I like to say, it is simply another tool to be used. Not too much but not too little emphasis on it.</span><br><br>17. In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7610371#p7610371\">1040</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7610407#p7610407\">1044</a>, I pose a question to UTL. The question is simply whether scum would generally tend to write posts like <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7594344#p7594344\">877</a> during the night phase. When UTL gave me his specific answer (I wanted the more general answer), I asked for a clarification. - <span style=\"font-style: italic\">I won't lie to myself, it certainly does look like an attempt for towncred, esp. the 2nd question. But, again, I think context is important and that the fact I asked that first question is also imperative.</span><br><br>18. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7614386#p7614386\">1098</a> is important. I voted UTL over Performer NOT because I thought UTL was scummier BUT because I didn't want to hammer Performer.<br><br>19. I made a pretty good point to Boon in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7634077#p7634077\">1387</a>. And quite frankly, I think it made quite a difference in his outlook on me. Personally, I do try to keep an unbiased perspective, which often leads to trouble. Basically, what I'm saying here is that everyone has a different POV and sometimes you get really biased (tunnel vision). But, when people point out your tunnel, you should step back for a minute (or more) and reconsider your view to determine if what you think is based on facts or your outlook.<br><br>20. Post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7636183#p7636183\">1488</a> ended up being a lot more of a link dump than anything. This was mainly because not too much interesting stuff happened in D2 til like the last 3 or so days. Nonetheless, even link dumps have their purposes: quick access to relevent info, so I'd say the post was worth it.<br><br>21. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7655157#p7655157\">1854</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7656916#p7656916\">1893</a> seem a bit weird. So, as crazy as this sounds, I thought that by voting my biggest townread, I'd get a reaction out of someone. When I noticed everyone ignored it, I think I realized I was too blatant about it. Scum could see the trap too easily and avoid it. So, obviously, it didn't work, BUT it shows people are engaged in this game and are paying significant attention to it.</div></div></div><br>And, that's it! I hope this self-assessment will prove useful. In both solving this game and understanding my perspective."}

While the way Performer worded his response could lead to ambiguity, the intended meaning imho was rather clear. I wouldn't necessarily say this is scum trying to look like they are scumhunting, but it's definitely something to keep in mind.<br><br>3. Axle basically just repeats what he quoted from PK in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7563738#p7563738\">282</a>. So, it is a bit late, but do you (Axle) remember exactly what you meant or trying to accomplish with the bottom part of that post?<br><br>4. Towards the end of <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7576723#p7576723\">680</a>, Axle mentions the fact that he saw two jesters yet it was a normal game. In a much later post, he says that the two he felt were jesters were AI and me (didn't realize he thought I was trying to get lynched.....). I'm just curious as to why this fact was important, did it really matter that you thought there was two jesters in the game, yet knew there couldn't be? Meh, I'll give it a null read.<br><br>5. Not part of Axle's ISO but relevant: In Ras's <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7581375#p7581375\">761</a>, he says I'm a red herring and his next strongest s.cumread is Axle. Ras flipped scum, but for some reasons, I get a slight associative scumread on Axle from here.<br><br>6. What was <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7581654#p7581654\">771</a> about? I really don't see the value in the post (aka fluff).<br><br>7. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7614535#p7614535\">1105</a> is interesting in that two ML's are his biggest scumreads. Though, I'm not getting opportunistic vibes in Axle's reads right now, I see reasonable logical and evidence behind them.</div></div></div><br><br>Meh. I think I'll stop there -- initial thoughts are Axle isn't really pushing a scum agenda."}

Ras's utter derailment of the PK wagon. This really didn't look like WK of a scumbuddy, it seems more like scum trying to get towncred off of someone they **know** are town but failed epicly at.<br><br>2. PK's disinterest (self-vote to prove a point, etc) at the beginning of the game. PK has said himself that he loves to play as scum, much more so than as town. So, PK's lack of interest at the beginning could be used as a sign he's town --&gt; He wasn't interested cuz he didn't roll scum.<br><br>3. The way PK switched wagons D2..... While I'd still like a reason for it, I feel that it wasn't just a move to try to garner towncred by jumping off the wagon of a person he **knew 100%** was town.<br><br>4. Similarly, PK began to feel GR was town during D4. Once again, I get town vibes; if you think  about it, the reasons against GR weren't very extreme, and myself was starting to think he was town. Unlike UTL and Ras, GR DID seem to be trying to engage and help town, he just failed to.<br><br>5. Idc what you say, but it was not 100% obvious that Boon was town after his hammer D3. The very fact that PK missed the pm from Boon loojs very genuine. Plus, PK did imo have the option to deny the pm, and when Boon flips later, if he's questioned about it, he could mention the fact that town has a roleblocker who could've roleblocked Boon D1.<br><br>6. D1, I saw what looked like a TvT fight between him and AI, as both were using poor reasoning to say the other was scum. If PK was truly scum, he'd prob. would've tried harder to get AI lynched; it really wouldn't've been hard. No, PK was just trolling AI."}

Sure, he was a nuisance and may be a bit difficult to lynch, but imo, there seemed to be way better canidates than AI for the n1 nk (most notably Keyser).<br><br>So, as I understand, Axle believes that AI was mainly nk'd cuz scum thought there was a high prob. of him being a PR. It is a reasonable conclusion, and in retrospect, it makes a lot of sense, although I never considered that explanation earlier. (Part of the reason why I asked someone else's opinion on the matter).<br><br>Now, at this point, I'm a bit lost (actually a lot). I haven't been following as well with everything (Axle can have...\u00a0 eh poor grammar a lot which can make it quite difficult sometimes). For the most part, I just feel that this game has too many people who are just goofing off or apathetic rather than actually trying to solve the game. One thing that I know for sure is that not a single one of us has any real idea as to where this game is going (well, that's not strictly the truth, but you get the gist). Most games have some kind of leader by this point, and if I'm not mistaken, Keyser was our leader ('least D2) and he's been nk'd and we have yet to chosen a successor.<br><br>Going back to D1, one of Rask's last posts included UTL, Axle, and Droog as the people he wanted lynch. As of right now, none of them have been lynched. Now, I'm delving in to the wifom territory, but let's consider why he wants each of these guys lynched.<br><br>If UTL is town: then it seems to me that Ras was taking advantage of the fact that a lot of people scumread him, so in essence, he was going for an easy mislynch on UTL. On the other hand, if UTL is scum, then this is an attempt to distance himself from one of his partners.<br><br>We know that for balance purposes, at least one of the people Ras listed has to be town. I'm thinking he most likely included Axle because he knew Axle was town and he knew that Axle was unlikely to be lynched. It was an attempt to cast doubt on a person who few people scumread. It had no point other than to try to make us second-guess each other.<br><br>Finally, we have Droog. Overall, I must say that I was pretty satisfied with Droog's play; however, I am rather displeased with RC's play. Nonetheless, I am thinking that RC is more likely town and that RC is following his meta that I prob. won't read. So, this slot is prob. also town.<br><br>With that being said, (this is the part that is def. subj. to fallancies), do you think that Ras would've on purposely included only players he knew were town? I think its plausible, as it would be a bit out of the normal flow and ebb of the game. People wouldn't expect it from scum as they would a mixed group.<br><br>With that being said, I think I'd prefer lynching Heat before UTL.<br><br>Last of all --&gt; What happened to the GR wagon??? RC dismantled almost the entire wagon! If we're going to lynch for info as PK suggested, I would think a Heat flip bit more informative than lynching GR.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: Golden Robster</span><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Heat</span></div></blockquote><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7643065#p7643065\" class=\"postlink\">post 1687</a>, Ircher wrote:</cite>Yeah, kinda.<br><br>My gist was that it was very possible that in his wifom, Ras decided to give the names of 3 townies rather than go for the more standard mixed group.

It is however consistent with *quite a few* other things I said today. So like duh.<br>Boon hammer looked townier than PK's flip onto UTL because it went to an actual hammer and flipped scum. It was in no sense certain the lynch on UTL was going through as i was hammering on RC pretty hard. So given the flip, Boon hammering then as scum seems exceedingly sketchy. So yeah maybe \"practically conftown\".<br><br>However describing that RC was lying about the friendly neighbor is straight up wrong.<br><br>History of Boons FN claim. (which becomes clear in hindsight.)<br><br>Boon:<br>hard top town read PK d1, friended him N1.<br>then top town read Droog, friended him N2.<br>RC replaced in. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7628712#p7628712\">1344</a> happened <br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7628719#p7628719\">1347</a> and while the friendly neighbor could say that to the person they friended, it make so much more sense the other way around. Espceially when you include <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7630893#p7630893\">1364</a><br>During the day Boon basically breadcrumbed his actions in plain sight... AKA: Discussed them.  <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7634690#p7634690\">1409</a> and more.<br><br>In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7643824#p7643824\">1732</a> Boon sets up for the lie he is going to tell.<br>In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7643851#p7643851\">1741</a> Boon tells the lie<br>This is RC agreeing with confirmed town boons <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7643884#p7643884\">1760</a> lie. (not RC lying for themselves)<br><br>BTW IMO RC's Town RB is the more useful role than FN, if UTL is scum as RC and boon thinks likely will flip scum. As with 1 scum left RB is reasonably quite investigative.<br>But yeah RC went along with it, thus painting an nk target on their own back. Not sure there was an other way out that wasn't worse at that point.<br><br>So yeah id reallllllly prefer less/fewer huge look at MEEEEEEE! flash in pan go big or go home plays, and more ones that milked the power of FN and RB for all they can be, by living longer.<br>But nope... Red check!!!!,  L-1 hammer, oops I'd better claim plays are seemingly the order of the day.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">@Boon</span>. yeah I know what you did.</div></div></div>"}

Regardless of the case, I see a genuine reason for Heat to express suspicion of me here, and that healthy suspicion leads to a townread.</span><br><br>2. The associative case of <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7557959#p7557959\">194</a> by Ras also leads to a townread.<br><br>3. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7557994#p7557994\">198</a> does not look like scum asking scum questions. - <span style=\"font-style: italic\">Again, what I see motive wise here is Heat wants to know why Ras gives him a bare townread. I don't see any hidden pretexts here.</span><br><br>4. Early on, AI expresses a scumread of Heat for \"opportunistically voting Ircher\". The logical reaction as conducted by Heat is to scumread AI, esp. considering AI wasn't supporting his read at all. - <span style=\"font-style: italic\">Again, you notice the pattern -- even if Heat may be wrong, etc, Heat has yet to show any scum motive in his actions.</span><br><br>5. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7610603#p7610603\">1049</a> by Heat follows the pattern.<br><br>6. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7634838#p7634838\">1417</a> by Heat is an example of a concept called \"empathy\". - <span style=\"font-style: italic\">What I like a lot about this post is the fact that Heat was not only able to consider the possibility I was town, but he also thought about how he would react in such a position. Sure, scum could make such a post, but when the target is very likely to get lynched eventually, that just seems like it's making scum's job harder. The way Heat was able to see my perspective and think about it from an unbiased perspective really makes me townread him. Empathy is a concept I think Boon couldn't understand well this game.</span></div></div></div><br><br>So, my strongest townread right now is actually Heat.<br><br>I've already explained my view of PK though I gotta keep in mind he can be sneaky at scum, aka, someone to look at during lylo.<br><br>Finally, I have a mild townlean on Axle as I don't see him pushing a scum agenda. Unfortunately, his analysis of stuff is a good way to keep suspicion off of him. Now that I spilled the beans about Axle and tonights nk, I wouldn't be surprised if scum choose a different target. (Thanks a lot, Axle <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif\" alt=\":|\" title=\"Neutral\"> )<br><br>That leaves me with Massive. Massive has done very little scumhunting and partially wants to lynch me just because I added in a part tellling him not to hammer Axle. It is no unheard of for someone to just go hammer someone early, so I added it as a precaution to allow Axle some time to speak, and what I get out of it is apparently a scumread (granted its not the only reason) and a L-1 vote.<br><br>@PK<br>I'm fine with an Axle lynch but would prefer a Massive lynch. Massive looks more opportunistic in his voting of me than Axle does. Axle has at least explained his read whereas Massive is not expressing his views well and continues to use his meta as an excuse for providing virtually zero useful content. While with all the other slots, I actually see good reasons to townread them, I do not with Massive.<br><br>Assuming:<br><br>1. Lynch Massive, Axle NK'd --&gt; I would lynch PK next simply because I'm town and PK acts the same regardless of alignment.<br><br>2. Lynch Massive, Someone else NK'd --&gt; I would lynch Axle<br><br>3. Lynch Axle, I'm NK'd (doubtful) --&gt; Lynch Massive<br><br>4. Lynch Axle, Massive NK'd --&gt; Would reexamine evidence. (PK may not have a motive for NKing Massive)<br><br>5. Lynch Axle, Someone else NK'd --&gt; Lynch Massive<br><br>6. Lynch Ircher, Axle NK'd --&gt; Please lynch Massive<br><br>7.

Sorry guys<br>Gg scum. <br><br>Thanks for modding, dier!</div></blockquote><br>Heat you need to be way more active when you play as town. Also, when people like pk, Ircher , and Axle put in so much effort (as seen in their proactive posting this game), that tends to be a town sign. You also should discern whether a player is town frustrated or scum feigning town frustration. This is a subtle thing but with more games, you should be able to tune that skill as a town player.<br>I hope you continue improving and use this game as a big learning experience.

(3) is also an extremely rare situation and there are usually better and more simple alternatives.</div></blockquote><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7433633#p7433633\" class=\"postlink\">post 53</a>, pieguyn wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7432420#p7432420\" class=\"postlink\">post 36</a>, Antihero wrote:</cite>fakeclaiming as town is about the equivalent of pulling down your pants and taking a dump on the board while playing a board game.<br><br>it might not be the worst thing anyone can do but it's still inconsiderate and annoying.</div></blockquote><br>I love you.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7431805#p7431805\" class=\"postlink\">post 31</a>, Cheetory6 wrote:</cite>What about underclaiming your results?<br>Like saying youre a weaker version of your role to try and get maximal value out of it?</div></blockquote><br>i.e., claiming \"2-shot Informed Tracker\" as a full gunsmith and mindfucking me cos I didn't stop to realize you had a role that would have allowed you to get another inno?  yes <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\"><br><br>claiming a tracker guilty when you have a cop guilty is one I also used to hear about a lot but I hardly ever see it done now</div></blockquote><br>I am against taking dump on the board while playing board game with people.

By the time I could come in and explain that \"cop + doc\" is viewed as overpowered in this day and age (especially compared to scum power level), it had already been Boon'ed.

(Not like I wasn't already working against at least half a town I knew I could never get lynched.)<br><br>One of the things that I needed to learn after coming back to the game after four or five years was that \"just scumhunting\" isn't enough any more -- this is a team game and there's a real amount of work that needs to go into determining who is on your team and then working with those people to attain your shared goal. It's still something I am fairly bad at, but I still don't get a \"W\" in the win/loss column if I'm completely correct in my scumreads but the town still loses, so that's why I keep trying."}

Give it time, maybe a page or more to see how people interact (or how they don't interact), regarding your vote. You can gain valuable information that way<br>-Learn how to better read people as town and scum. A number of people don't manipulate their meta very well, like myself and SilverWolf for instance. You can find out more about my playstyle in my Wiki webpage, the link you'll find in my profile<br>-Try not to lynch high-quality players early on (like day 1). RC is a wildcard but I've come to find out he's very sharp as  town. pk seems to be pushy as town, as he has his own way of scumhunting - but he's also quite sharp as town too. As for newer players that you're not familiar with, if they're not producing quality content, a general rule I follow is to vote them if there are no other strong scumreads<br>-When you're wagoned, perform wagon analysis. Go into why you believe each person voted for you<br>-When people are lurking heavily and/or not scumhunting, you should call them out on that. Don't let them get away with this, as it's dangerous to town<br>-PROTECT your PRs . For example, in d1, if someone claims PR, you do NOT want to keep your vote on them unless you want to increase your chance of loss<br>-If people aren't making sense, ask them to clarify. If they still aren't making sense, they could be scum<br>-If people continue to not answer your questions, they could be scum<br>-If people vote you or someone for super-strange reason (\"he's playing differently here than the other game,\" for example), they could be scum<br>-Look at people's reasoning to determine where they're coming from<br>-By d3, if there was no scum lynch, this means you should adjust your play accordingly. The other reason is other Townies aren\u2019t playing skillfully enough in lynching scum<br>-On d4 and onward, mass claiming can be a great idea to out scum<br>-Halfway through a day phase, especially after d1, we should get a wagon to L-1 to force a claim. However, on d1, if we end up with no lynch, that can still help town since it minimizes chance of a PR mislynch or PR nk \u2013 overnight, the town PRs do work and find information\u2026AFTER d1 though, no lynch is generally bad for town because it causes superfluous suspicion<br>-FoS X for\u2026<br>-Cops should ideally be targeting people they have trouble reading, to maximize the information gain, so if you were well-townread in game you can minimize the chance you are investigated.<br>-If you\u2019re a PR like Tracker, Cop, or Follower, and you discover something about someone else \u2013 and they end up revealing the next day your, you should play carefully so that your play doesn't automatically indicate things about yourself. You do NOT want to risk yourself AND the other PR on the same phase, generally speaking<br>-why were the nk targets targeted, analyze vote counts for who they targeted, order of claims, look at connections between flipped scum and pr votes<br>-reasons for no nk: scum didn\u2019t submit an nk target, Bp was hit, Jailkeeper/Roleblocker action, someone was protected by a Doctor<br>-Don't drop a case if you're being ignored because then you become That Guy in the post-game. There may be a reason behind your being ignored, and you want to root that out as soon as possible. Be annoying about your case. Start bugging people individually about why they're not giving it attention. Aim for the most likely town player who happens to have more charisma than you.<br>-Before we policy lynch someone, we have to carefully consider what information we can gain from that. If we don\u2019t gain information from that regardless of the flip, then we must seriously consider better alternatives.<br>-Collaborate with others - you have strength in numbers. Work on logical, consistent, truthful arguments, which are pro-town.<br>-Keeping things clear and concise is usually a good way to go<br>-Stay active since town mistrusts lurkers; when breadcrumbing as PR, you may want to breadcrumb in d1 so you can refer back to breadcrumbs in order to make them more believable; do wagon analysis when you\u2019re heavily wagoned; don\u2019t put forth too many convoluted hypothetical cases because that\u2019ll be tough to defend and scum will twist that to mislynch you; don\u2019t just take someone\u2019s word for it - ask why they townread you; on d1 if someone fake claims, we can have no one cc, therefore overnight, we can find have the PRs use their actions, the next day we can find out if the d1 claim was truthful, and decide from there on who to lynch; vote count analysis, night kill analysis (discovering motives), what the dead posted<br>-because Vanilla Townies have no special powers (active powers), they have to depend on traditional scumhunting methods - analysis of actions, intent, voting, previous posts, etc. - to win; The most practical purpose a Vanilla Townie has is its capacity to draw the Mafia's Night-kill away from power roles via Day play. A Vanilla Townie may also attempt gambits they would not consider otherwise (if they were PR), such as fake claims (which are highly dependent on a number of factors). If you somehow during the game, get the possibility to reveal a lie, don\u2019t hesitate to do it, even though it would mean your probable demise soon (as it\u2019ll turn you into a confirmed innocent, most likely the next target for the Mafia ). Trading a Townie\u2019s life for a Mafia member is always a good deal for the Town. As you can see, by just staying out of the way and avoiding getting lynched, investigated or protected, a Townie can help his group a great deal. The less people yelling \u201cthis and that are Mafia\u201d, the more clearly the situation can be analyzed. I\u2019m not saying all the Townies should shut up every game. That\u2019s incorrect, as it would encourage Mafias being silent as well, and help them blend in the crowd. What I AM saying is that, in order to be a good Townie, you have to use your brain before posting, ESPECIALLY before voting, and never hesitate to sacrifice yourself if the situation allows for it. Add to that acting in a non-suspicious manner, and you\u2019ve increased the Town\u2019s chances greatly<br>-Be aware of the weak points of your reads list. For instance you may be townreading scum and scumreading town, which is one critical reason you could be left alive throughout nights.<br>-If you are suspicious of people who turn out town after all, at least it won\u2019t cost us a power role by lynching. If you assume that town always tell the truth about their role (which they should), then lynching a VT claim is inherently safer than lynching a power-role claim. That's not to say that claiming VT is a surefire way to get lynched - you should judge people on their play in the current game <br>-I think I gave a bit of advice a few pgs ago as well, for your play<br><br>-----<br>If you have anymore specific questions, feel free to let us know. <br>And remember, please don't ask questions about ongoing games."}
