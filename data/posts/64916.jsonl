{"number": 1, "id": "7545628", "user": "Dierfire", "user_id": "25388", "content": "<div style=\"text-align:center\">RULES</div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">General</div></div><br>\n01. All site-wide rules apply. They may be found <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=6470\" class=\"postlink\">here</a> for reference.<br>\n02. I will deal with any violations of these rules as I think appropriate, including by replacing a player or by removing a player from the game (in which case the player will be declared to have lost regardless of prior win conditions). I will consult with site leadership as necessary to ensure appropriate responses to rule violations.<br>\n03. I have written these rules with the intent that they will cover all foreseeable situations. However, it is possible that I may have overlooked something, and the rules are subject to change at my discretion to correct any such errors. Should any changes be implemented, they will be announced in the same format as the original rule (for example, changes to the main set of rules will be announced in the main thread; changes to role-specific rules will be sent by PM).<br>\n04. Pretending to violate any of these rules will be treated the same as an actual violation.<br>\n05. In the event that I make an error, please call it to my attention by PM or by addressing me in the relevant thread (I will look for &#8220;@Mod&#8221;).<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Posting</div></div><br>\n06. Players should not discuss this game in any channels other than those I have provided.<br>\n07. Players should not use any form of hidden or encoded text. Players should use English exclusively.<br>\n08. Once I have declared a player to be dead, that player should not post in the main thread until I have declared the game to be over.<br>\n09. Players should not provide direct quotations from, images of, or other provable references to any game-related PM or PT.<br>\n10. Players may not use any form of provable randomness for any reason.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Timing</div></div><br>\n11. Each Day Phase will last 10 days. Each Night Phase will last 48 hours. In between, there will be a period not to exceed 24 hours for me to write the transition.<br>\n12. Players who have not posted in 48 consecutive hours will receive a prod. After receiving a prod, a player has 24 hours to post before I will begin seeking a replacement.<br>\n13. If a player being replaced for inactivity should return to the game before a replacement is found, that player may be allowed to continue in the game at my discretion. However, once a player has been replaced, that player may not continue in the game.<br>\n14. Players on V/LA will be exempt from the prod requirements above. However, if a player requires an extensive period of V/LA, I may determine that the game would be better served by a replacement and replace that player at my discretion.<br>\n15. Deadlines may be extended at my discretion as necessary to ensure that the game continues smoothly. Any such extension will be announced in the main thread.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Day Phase</div></div><br>\n16. Players may vote to lynch another player using either vote tags or bold tags as demonstrated below.<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Name</span><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: Name</div><br>\n17. In order to be counted votes should appear on a separate line and not within spoiler tags or otherwise concealed. Votes not following this format may be counted if I believe that a vote was intended.<br>\n18. When one player has achieved a majority of votes (more living players voting for that player than living players not voting for that player), that player will be lynched and the phase will end. If the deadline is reached before a lynch is achieved, no player will be lynched.<br>\n19. Players may vote to end the phase without a lynch. An example of such a vote is given below:<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: No Lynch</span><br>\nIf the number of living players voting for this option is greater than or equal to the number of living players not voting for this option, the phase will end without a lynch and the game will proceed directly to Night Phase.<br>\n20. Players may continue to post in the main thread until I have announced the end of the phase, regardless of whether or not a lynch has occurred.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Miscellaneous</div></div><br>\n21. Players should not edit or delete their posts. I will fix formatting errors upon request.<br>\n22. Players should not attempt to impersonate me in any way.<br>\n23. Everyone is here to have fun, and I hope that we will all keep this in mind throughout the game. Please contact me directly (by PM) with any problems or questions.<br>\n24. In addition to the site-wide rules, it may be useful to review the <a href=\"http://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Normal_Game\" class=\"postlink\">Normal Game guidelines</a> and the <a href=\"http://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Natural_Action_Resolution/Normal_Game\" class=\"postlink\">Natural Action Resolution guidelines</a>.<br>\n25. At least one player will receive the following role:<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Welcome, (name), to Mini 1755!<br>\n<br>\nYour role is: Vanilla Town, aligned with <div style=\"display:inline;color:green\">Town</div>.<br>\nAbilities: You have no special abilities.<br>\nWin Conditions: You win if all living players are aligned with Town.</div></blockquote>", "time": "Fri Jan 08, 2016 8:49 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=64916&start=0", "forum": "53", "thread": "64916"}

To be truthful, I never really said Axle was scum. I guess I kinda implied it, but later I stated that when I say \"scummiest\", it is a relative term; it doesn't necessarily mean I think you're scum. Anyway, I can see town Axle doing it, but out of everyone at that point, Axle seemed to be the most suspicious.<br>\n<br>\n2. Because you do seem to be defending Axle a lot. I will say it is too early to be making judgment calls, but I got to start somewhere. Don't worry, you're not in jeopardy of being lynched (yet).<br>\n<br>\n3. That's just the way I saw it.

I wrote the post poorly though, so Keyser interpreted it as me saying other people stated you were the scummiest. Upon looking back over the post, I realized I meant to say \"for the reason(s) others have stated.\"<br>\n<br>\nSecondly, my only reason was simply your question. Though, to put it another way, at the time, your question made me suspicious of you and you were the only person who did anything that was suspicious to me.<br>\n<br>\nTherefore, since no one else was suspicious to me, you were my top suspect.<br>\n<br>\nI did not vote you for a few reasons: 1) We're still in RVS 2) Voting shows that you strongly believe someone is scum. I didn't strongly believe you were scum; I simply felt more suspicious of you versus everyone else. 3) It isn't a good thing to constantly be changing our votes. Since I had miniscule evidence suggesting you were scum, it wan't worth the effort.<br>\n<br>\nNow, I voted Keyser for a few reasons: 1) He did seem to be rreally defending you. I found it a bit suspicious. 2) Combined with my suspicion of you, it did make you two seem like scum partners.<br>\n<br>\nFinally, I have yet to unvote Keyser because I don't have a lot of reads. When I get more reads and find someone who is more deserving of a vote, I will probably change votes.<br>\n<br>\nSo far, my reads are as follows:<br>\n<br>\nLean Scum (Very Weak) - Keyser, Axle -- I've explained myself<br>\nLean Town (Weak) - AI -- His joking attitude is actually town-indicative.

The reason why I sugget PL Pisskop was because he was unpleasant and self-voted. As explained in my first game here, self-voting is objectively bad and good evidence of scum. I did not vote because I am wary of mislynches. Which, in Newbie 1666, you will be able to see I tend to err on the cautious side of things. Not to mention that we had three mislynches in a row that game (Zombie, who self-voted, Jake, who was being stubborn and uncooperative, and myself, because we were in lylo and there was lke a wall between me and DoTA who was town.)

AI, I was going to ask you yesterday why you had me leaning more town, but now I'd also like to know why such the drastic change in read in a single day? <br>\n<br>\nI dislike Ras' townread on me with no explanation. I also dislike his lack of content in the few posts he's written. More please?<br>\n<br>\nPerformer is a town lean for me. His behavior is consistent with what I know town Performer to be, but I'd like to see more since I'm not huge on pure meta reads on people.<br>\n<br>\nI understand Ircher's want to PL Pisskop, but I don't like his unwillingness to do something about it. I get that he might be unsure if he actually reads scum or not, however I feel like getting us all to agree to a PL is a great way to get a lynch and a way out of suspicion if PK were to flip town. I do like his response to Heat's thoughts on him, seemed rational.<br>\n<br>\nHeat wants to know about AI's read list and reasons for it, but isn't giving one himself. Actually, he's only responded to Keyser's reads after Keyser directly asked him about it when trying to get him to engage more. After that he only says he doesn't like Ras because of questionable town read, and then we get nothing else. Do you have opinions on anybody else in the game? Would you like to give us your reads and explanations for them?<br>\n<br>\nI like Keyser for town. He asks proactive questions, and actively tries to engage people (Heat, PK). I really like his interactions with PK. They're more productive than most people's have been, as he's not just feeding into PK's bad attitude.<br>\n<br>\nI believe Pisskop is just fishing for reactions tbh. The following is in PK's sig:<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Taking the piss out of the First Day<br>\nTaking the piss - an expression meaning to mock, tease, ridicule, or scoff. most widely used in the United Kingdom, Ireland, South Africa, New Zealand and Australia.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nThe purpose of this guide:<br>\n<br>\nCreate a challenge for players<br>\nTeach early combat tips and techniques<br>\nPrioritize how to obtain basic needs under pressure<br>\nExplain to quickly reach a state of self-sufficiency and reach mid-game.<br>\nHighlight the value of Preventative Maintainance, which in game-terms is primarily tailoring and mechanics.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nI'm null on his behavior based on this.

His recent post with reads is rather cookie-cutter and I want to note him putting PK as perfect neutral/null. It is hypocritical coming from me but I'm not seeing that depth or insight in these, basically townreads on people logical and active, weak scumread on axle for low scumhunt and scumread on me. This isn't straight up scummy it's moreso that I'm not feeling it to be so genuine, so you can call that gut or w/e.<br>\n<br>\nKeysor I didn't like earlier from 1 post that I responded to but skimming her ISO she's ok. null<br>\n<br>\nPK still rough. I actually never talked about PK, I thought I did. He's a weak townlean, though it's hard to read someone acting like that I think his emotions are genuine, and maybe more importantly his actions have for the most part benefited town or at least moved the game forward. I am a little surprised he hasn't mentioned me considering I am leading wagon and I think the counterwagon to his so that's weird. (inb4 he hates me)<br>\n<br>\nDeus I went over. Initially overanalyses/nitpicks which I don't like that early in the game. Joining PK wagon was meh since it was policy, but it's believable she cares and so is passable. And I see she actually hasn't visited the website since then. OK I should have checked that first she'll prob get replaced.<br>\n<br>\nMy read on UTL was pretty much entirely from <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7556195#p7556195\">124</a>, and since then I liked her questions she's asked people and her 264 as well. towny<br>\nIn general idk how to explain townreads.

Accurate about it all as far as I can see, and I get the feeling when you try that hard to be meticulous and thorough in looking in the wagon it shows a certain reservedness to not want an easy or lazy lynch; scum instead not really caring if a lynch is bad and not showing such paranoia. I really see think she's frustrated about the selfvote and about what to do about the situation. I didn't think about it at the time but the only way I could see this from a scum is if they were scum together so that she would have a reason to have the genuine concern I'm feeling.

Which means, you're either ignorant, scum misleading town, or I am doing a poor job expressing my thoughts. Second of all, you claim I am trying to get permission to change votes. Do you take me to be an idiot? I am well aware I do not need permission to change votes. Third, the longer the day, the better for town, as ton can get more info. So, rather than stay on the Ras wagon and lynch probable scum, I take the time to switch focus to another person and attempt to find the other scum. Bearing this in mind, I always know that if deadline is near, I can always switch to the Ras wagon. My post was completely town motivated. I see this as another post attempting to mislead town.</div><br>\n<br>\n7. Consensus is necessary to arrive at the right conclusions. Although, I could've worded that response post a little better.

You state I am not the perfect town read. I completely agree with you on that. But, let me ask you, are you the perfect? I think not. Do you make mistakes? I'm sure you do even if you don't admit to it. Therefore, AI is using my meta (as he played a game with me) as the basis of his read of me. If AI thought I was being inconsistent in my play style, he'd prob. call me out on it. Here, A is simply saying that ya'll haven't provided enough AI enough evidence to show I am scum.

I'm unsure of whether or not this is his style of playing but nonetheless, it's not useful. <br>\n- Interestingly, at one point he votes himself. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7555337#p7555337\">#100</a>. Self-resignation? Creating a negative view(maybe that is what he wants) but regardless, my current view of him is definitely leaning towards scum/null. I'd be surprised if anybody ACTUALLY thought he was a town member with that post. Maybe that is just his style, idk.<br>\n- This conflict between PK and AI is quite interesting. Need to look further into that and I'll post my observations about it later.<br>\n- Interesting, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7572308#p7572308\">#478</a>.

Indeed, I'm also quite suspicious of that question. Why post it on the forum when a private message would equally do the same job?

UpTooLate<br>\n<br>\n- The post that gave town leading read on her was this one. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7556195#p7556195\">#124</a>. She breaks down and analyses what has been going. She states concisely that AI jumped onto the PK wagon and Keyser sheeps. PK at this point gives up, self-votes and Ircher wants to lynch him on his bad attitude. <br>\n       - Analysis and summary of what happened. PK has had no post with substance other than one or two maybe, maybe he wanted to see the reaction of town? She explains that we're put in a bad situation if we PL him and flips town, or we leave him and he continues with the lack of substance. <br>\n       - Agree with the idea that we're put in a bad spot if we PL him and he does flip town? What then? <br>\n<br>\n No RVS vote  ----&gt; Votes Ircher. <br>\n<br>\n05. droog<br>\n<br>\n- <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7564268#p7564268\">#294</a>.

VERY INTERESTING POST. I LIKE IT. Talks about how UTL could be trying to look town with #124 and could be in fact scum. Then again, it could be absolutely possible that she is in fact townie but anyways, I'll delve more into that once one of you flips. <br>\n- <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7567847#p7567847\">#390</a>. \"Everything performer has said on this page is townie\"<br>\n- <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7570910#p7570910\">#432</a>.

PK has been at him with nothing of substance, with no sense of real intent. Unless, of course, he was just trying to see what reaction he could get out of the guy that, at the time, wasn&#8217;t really contributing much either. If that&#8217;s the case, it worked. He definitely got a reaction. <br>\n<br>\nWhat&#8217;s really bothering me is the selfvote. He says he doesn&#8217;t care about this game, and yet, he doesn&#8217;t want to let somebody who does sub in for him. At this point, we&#8217;re put in a crappy situation. If we Policy Lynch like Ircher is suggesting, he may flip town and we&#8217;re already down on day 1, which isn't a good start. If we don&#8217;t and he survives the night, he may just continue with his current level of participation (or lack thereof) and draining attitude.<br>\n<br>\nI guess what I want to know, PK, is what exactly is your intent with the selfvote?</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nWhat parts of the post do you like?

I had originally had a town lean on AI, but I thought more about it, and the fact that he won't answer questions is off putting, as is his defense for someone from pretty much the beginning who he shouldn't \"know\" is town. So I had moved him down to a scum lean, along with Ircher by association. As for your question, I had moved them to a null town.

Post RVS he votes Ircher for ok reasoning, he didn't like Ircher scumreading him based on the innocuous question to keysor about fakeclaiming. <br>\nI think posts like <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7552829#p7552829\">60</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7552862#p7552862\">61</a> are rather awkward from town and especially the latter in which he's trying to teach his vote. He talks a lot about theory and what how he plays the game which never gives me a good feeling about someone. He loves to go into meta, which he did for ircher (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7556078#p7556078\">118</a>), then later for others in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7563940#p7563940\">286</a> <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7564115#p7564115\">288</a> and also for me in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7568718#p7568718\">412</a> which he tries to use as justification to vote me. He comes in as the 4th man on my wagon (though sort of 5th as ircher had just switched to droog for a while at the time), which is involved but not a focus point as the l-1 or a later hammer-decider would be. I think it's BS how he tried to twist my intentions (trying to paint my RVS as scummy which is absurd, and also assuming that me not liking the PK wagon = must have strong townread on him despite statements to the contrary) and justifies his vote with meta despite it all being ongoing-game and not much of it either. Overall I hate his primary tool of reading everyone being meta (see: his conclusion on ircher, PK, and me) which isn't something that people can really engage over, and his wishy-washy focus. I feel he's been involved in pretty much every going-on in the thread but his actual actions feel half-hearted and weak. My concern is that the weirdness I feel in his posts is partially from his quirks as a player and I might be going too hard on him for that. Medium Scumlean.<br>\n<br>\nIrcher + AI<br>\nMy previously made points on Ircher all still stand. What spooked me off the Ircher wagon was the Ircher &lt;-&gt; AI interaction, recently reinforced. Yeah, AI's hard defended Ircher all game from a level of confidence that doesn't match his reasoning (a shared game and no idea of what scumIrcher looks like). But now in addition Ircher is saying he gut-reads AI despite not liking his posts and its based on something that'd be \"prob. be best I didn't say.\", which is kind of fishy. I don't think being in a scumteam would explain this behaviour, I get the feeling they're in a neighbourhood or something else is going on I can't understand. I don't feel as comfortable with this as before though at this rate I don't think I'll get what I want anyways.<br>\n<br>\nDroog<br>\nHasn't changed particularly much from the null-scum earlier (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7574391#p7574391\">610</a>). Since then, he admits I wasn't on his reads lists for lack of impression one way or another but soon after states he'd be down joining the wagon on me so that's meh. I haven't looked into the performer case and wagon so I'll reserve judgement on that, but I do remember previous to his scumread him saying everything on the page by performer was town which is funny. Still a weak read to do anything but I'd take this wagon over one on a townread or me.<br>\n<br>\nI'm going to bed now.

He's been putting the effort to try scumhunt this game and actually focus and prioritize even if it's been on me more often than not. The drawback is his big pool of people he admits to being up for lynching leaving him a ton of flexibility, and his vote on me at this point could be motivated by his own wagon gaining some momentum.

Id love to 1v1 you. You arent good enough to beat me.&#8221;<br>\n<br>\nI'm townreading him. He's much more involved here, than when he's scum. When he was scum against PantherPunt and scum against me, he posted extremely brief posts that didn't dig deeper than the surface. He was still posting very much but the depth of his posts weren't apparent in those games, when he was scum. Here, he's providing info and pressuring people.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF0000\">Null </div><br>\n<br>\nHeat - Just went over Heat 's ISO since AI voted Heat, and Heat left his vote on AI since the RVS. <br>\nHeat's ISO looks sparse.<br>\nUTL questioned why Heat townread her, Heat's next post was to AI about \"Chris Crocker,\" rather than replying to UTL. <br>\nHowever, later Heat addressed UTL and my questions in his posts. So for now, I&#8217;m null on Heat.<br>\n-----<br>\nBoon &#8211; his posts since his replace-in, have touched on Droog/pk/Ircher. His predecessor voted pk, Boon unvoted him. His posts look like he&#8217;s just standing on the periphery regarding those 3.<br>\nHis play here before his first big post of d1, appeared to resemble the game where he was scum versus Keys  &amp; I.<br>\n<br>\nBoon's <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7574431#p7574431\">611</a> &amp; <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7574436#p7574436\">612</a> defense against my pressure on him, actually sounded sensible to me. However, I don't see how Boon was scumreading Rask at the time of his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7574431#p7574431\">611</a> post.

In the same post reply, he stated he agreed with AI more than he thought he would...which I think is a scummy excuse for creating fluff.

While Massive (seems) to have a habit of leaving on weekends, he didn't tell anyone, not even the mod. He assumed his meta was sufficient to explain his absence from the game. Imo, that's just wrong. Oh, and speaking of meta, he seems to assume that his meta is enough for anyone to read his alignment. Sounds to me like a scummy excuse to not participate in the game.

Boonskies - To be truthful, aside from his case against me, he hasn't really acted scummy. BUT, his case against me is extremely exaggerated and doesn't seem very genuine to me. Even after pointing out that I wasn't wagon hopping by actually quoting vc's as proof, he didn't seem to believe me.

I'm not really beliving her alibi either. I'll reevaluate my read though in my Night review of the thread.<br>\n12. AlwaysInnocent - Well, it seems that AI has gione from an early likely town read to my currently highest scumread....<br>\n<br>\nFirst of all, I will explain my \"gut\" read of AI that I earlier stated \"prob. be best I didn't say\". To begin with, when I made that statement, I was trying to avoid giving the scum more reasons to lynch me. Anyway, it boils down to three things: 1) (The oart that I didn't want to share) Confirmation Bias that AI is town (is that proper usage?) and 2) AI has posted way more this game than he did in Newbie 1666 as scum. and 3) AI was defending me. (Another thing I really didn't want to share then).<br>\n<br>\nSo, even that aside, why is AI now my top scum read? I've thought about AI's interactions, and they don't seem to be town motivated:<br>\n<br>\nRefusing to answer questions? Check.<br>\nBuddying up to a townie to try to get that townie avoid lynching you? Check.<br>\nProviding very vague and terse reasons for scumreads? Check.<br>\nNot really scumhunting?

In post <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7550481#p7550481\" class=\"postlink\">27</a> by me, I make the rather confusing statement that a lot of people think Axle is the scummiest player currently in the game when I meant that I thought Axle was the scummiest player in the game based off the comments of other players. This led me to get questioned by Keyser due to the way I worded the post (more likely, the statement was a typo -- I type stuff and don't bother checking).

I also see evidence that Heat doesn't fully understand how PL works. I'll put it this way: some players are so irratable that keeping them as town does more harm than conducting a PL on them. I will admit, D1 is early for a PL suggestion, but later along the line, if the player in question persists (and isn't replaced), then he/she will eventually get lynched as people find irritable players scummier than other players (at least that's how I see it).

Definitely will try to get a good read on this slot over the night and on D2.<br>\n8. Performer - This is one of my weaker reads. He had a great start, then seemed to just like vanish from the game, and then around deadline, he's back but plays in a way that is scummy. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">FoS Performer</div><br>\n</div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#CC7000\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Leaning Scum</div> - In Order<br>\n9. Massive - My weakest read right now. This guy, I don't really understand. As far as I can tell, he hasn't contributed anything useful, and he has barely participated in the game. While Massive (seems) to have a habit of leaving on weekends, he didn't tell anyone, not even the mod. He assumed his meta was sufficient to explain his absence from the game. Imo, that's just wrong. Oh, and speaking of meta, he seems to assume that his meta is enough for anyone to read his alignment. Sounds to me like a scummy excuse to not participate in the game. I haven't read his meta (and prob. won't), but I'm pretty sure it is not that clear cut as he assumes. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">FoS Massive</div><br>\n10. Boonskies - To be truthful, aside from his case against me, he hasn't really acted scummy. BUT, his case against me is extremely exaggerated and doesn't seem very genuine to me. Even after pointing out that I wasn't wagon hopping by actually quoting vc's as proof, he didn't seem to believe me. It could be Confirmation Bias on his end, but I think its prob. more scum-related motives trying to frame me.<br>\n</div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#DD3000\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Likely Scum</div> - In Order<br>\n11. UpTooLate - First of all, I'm starting to believe what others have said about her. As Keyser pointed out, her \"reaction test\" of me was not only ineffective, but also rather far-fetched. I'm not really beliving her alibi either. I'll reevaluate my read though in my Night review of the thread.<br>\n12. AlwaysInnocent - Well, it seems that AI has gione from an early likely town read to my currently highest scumread....<br>\n<br>\nFirst of all, I will explain my \"gut\" read of AI that I earlier stated \"prob. be best I didn't say\". To begin with, when I made that statement, I was trying to avoid giving the scum more reasons to lynch me. Anyway, it boils down to three things: 1) (The oart that I didn't want to share) Confirmation Bias that AI is town (is that proper usage?) and 2) AI has posted way more this game than he did in Newbie 1666 as scum. and 3) AI was defending me. (Another thing I really didn't want to share then).<br>\n<br>\nSo, even that aside, why is AI now my top scum read? I've thought about AI's interactions, and they don't seem to be town motivated:<br>\n<br>\nRefusing to answer questions? Check.<br>\nBuddying up to a townie to try to get that townie avoid lynching you? Check.<br>\nProviding very vague and terse reasons for scumreads? Check.<br>\nNot really scumhunting? Check.<br>\n<br>\nI am convinced that AI is not really helping the town and the few useful things he has said seem to be more opportunistic and fabricated rather than town-motivated and genuine.

While Massive (seems) to have a habit of leaving on weekends, he didn't tell anyone, not even the mod. He assumed his meta was sufficient to explain his absence from the game. Imo, that's just wrong. Oh, and speaking of meta, he seems to assume that his meta is enough for anyone to read his alignment. Sounds to me like a scummy excuse to not participate in the game.

I'm not really beliving her alibi either. I'll reevaluate my read though in my Night review of the thread.<br>\n12. AlwaysInnocent - Well, it seems that AI has gione from an early likely town read to my currently highest scumread....<br>\n<br>\nFirst of all, I will explain my \"gut\" read of AI that I earlier stated \"prob. be best I didn't say\". To begin with, when I made that statement, I was trying to avoid giving the scum more reasons to lynch me. Anyway, it boils down to three things: 1) (The oart that I didn't want to share) Confirmation Bias that AI is town (is that proper usage?) and 2) AI has posted way more this game than he did in Newbie 1666 as scum. and 3) AI was defending me. (Another thing I really didn't want to share then).<br>\n<br>\nSo, even that aside, why is AI now my top scum read? I've thought about AI's interactions, and they don't seem to be town motivated:<br>\n<br>\nRefusing to answer questions? Check.<br>\nBuddying up to a townie to try to get that townie avoid lynching you? Check.<br>\nProviding very vague and terse reasons for scumreads? Check.<br>\nNot really scumhunting?

If we allow him to coast through this game, then we could be doomed; apparently, I'm the only who thinks he should be a bit more active, regardless of meta.<br>\n<br>\nThe way I see it, mods give 48 hrs before prods because sometimes you get super busy and cannot play for awhile. I see the way Massive plays as an abuse of the system: he posts only 2-3 times a weeks and is completely absent on weekends. That isn't proper in my opinion. While I don't think you shouldn't spam the thread, I also think you should stay engaged in the thread and strive to post at least once a day. I know some people have a busy schedule, but if you are so busy that you cannot post once a day regularly, I question why you signed up/haven't replaced out yet.<br>\n<br>\nMy biggest issue is how Massive takes the weekends off. With only 10 days to a day, that is a very efficient way (as scum) to avoid having to scumhunt and appear as town.<br>\n<br>\nSo, let me ask all of you:.<br>\n<br>\nWhat has Massive done that makes you townread him?", "time": "Thu Jan 28, 2016 10:25 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=64916&start=1025", "forum": "53", "thread": "64916"}

This led me to get questioned by Keyser due to the way I worded the post (more likely, the statement was a typo -- I type stuff and don't bother checking).

I also see evidence that Heat doesn't fully understand how PL works. I'll put it this way: some players are so irratable that keeping them as town does more harm than conducting a PL on them. I will admit, D1 is early for a PL suggestion, but later along the line, if the player in question persists (and isn't replaced), then he/she will eventually get lynched as people find irritable players scummier than other players (at least that's how I see it).

This led me to get questioned by Keyser due to the way I worded the post (more likely, the statement was a typo -- I type stuff and don't bother checking).

He could also create a Mafia Discussion thread on the topic or he could've replied to the already existing Mastin Academy thread.

I have the same issue with Heat's <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7566800#p7566800\">357</a> as I do with UTL's <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7566602#p7566602\">354</a>. I also see evidence that Heat doesn't fully understand how PL works. I'll put it this way: some players are so irratable that keeping them as town does more harm than conducting a PL on them. I will admit, D1 is early for a PL suggestion, but later along the line, if the player in question persists (and isn't replaced), then he/she will eventually get lynched as people find irritable players scummier than other players (at least that's how I see it). In particular, you wouldn't want to go in to LyLo with a person like what Pisskop was at the beginning of the game. - <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Null-Indicative</div>[/i] Oh, and no, I don't think that Pisskop deserves a PL anymore, it's no longer postponed.<br>\n<br>\n31.

Yet in linked post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7557723#p7557723\">170</a>, he&#8217;s trying to help us better figure out AI&#8217;s alignment&#8230;and seems genuinely frustrated about AI being scum. <br>\n<br>\nLater he posts this to droog, which comes off very strange to me: &#8220;Then vote. Id love to 1v1 you. You arent good enough to beat me.&#8221;<br>\n<br>\nI'm townreading him. He's much more involved here, than when he's scum. When he was scum against PantherPunt and scum against me, he posted extremely brief posts that didn't dig deeper than the surface. He was still posting very much but the depth of his posts weren't apparent in those games, when he was scum. Here, he's providing info and pressuring people.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF0000\">Null </div><br>\n<br>\nHeat - Just went over Heat 's ISO since AI voted Heat, and Heat left his vote on AI since the RVS. <br>\nHeat's ISO looks sparse.<br>\nUTL questioned why Heat townread her, Heat's next post was to AI about \"Chris Crocker,\" rather than replying to UTL. <br>\nHowever, later Heat addressed UTL and my questions in his posts.

In the same post reply, he stated he agreed with AI more than he thought he would...which I think is a scummy excuse for creating fluff.  Later on, he added the 1st 2 to his townreads, which caused me to null read him.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF0000\">Scum<br>\n</div><br>\n<br>\nRask - I was scum leaning Ras for his very brief and mysterious posts.

His pg 31 didn't look right either - like he didn't care about or wanted to actively impede progress.

His catch-up after the weekend , on pg 30, looks like empty posting. His <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7579227#p7579227\">754</a> is alright, as he ended it with stating things that sound like typical town - sure on a few things, unsure on a few things.

He tends to be very analytical, sometimes to the point of paranoia. I&#8217;m only speaking about his town game because I&#8217;ve never seen his scum game. <br>\n-----<br>\nIrcher - <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7578224#p7578224\">726</a> touched on 4 players in a vague, ambiguous manner. Along with all the analyses on Ircher between pgs 21-30, I was not believing that slot to be town anymore. However, his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7584853#p7584853\">814</a> unvote of Ras when we were about 13 hours before d1 ended, because he was concerned about accidental hammer &#8211; looks highly Townie to me &#8211; and if anything, it looks like a rookie town move. <br>\n<br>\nHeat&#8217;s ISO was massively focused on Ircher on d2. Ircher was looking more likely to be rookie town by the way of his posts, saying things like the below (scumreading me for a non-scum reason) Also, he is 16. I'm thinking scum sees Ircher as an easy person to lynch because of these 2 reasons.<br>\n&#8220;As to your question -- It does look a desparate Performer who is doing a last minute bus of his partner. Definitely dob't think a read can change that quick.&#8221;<br>\n<br>\nIrcher could&#8217;ve hammered me after UTL put me at L-1 on d2, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7613409#p7613409\">1086</a>. Instead in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7613909#p7613909\">1088</a>, he voted UTL so that makes me continue thinking he&#8217;s town since I&#8217;d think scum would go for the hammer in that situation. His willingness to push us all the way to the end of deadline, is something many new Townies and even I did, in my first town game on this site. <br>\n-----<br>\nAxle &#8211; has been trying to sort things out in his posts. His reads list of the following people looking town - I only agree with 4 of them: Kesyer, Pisskop, Droog, Massive, Ircher.<br>\n<br>\nThe problem with this slot though, is on d2, he&#8217;s been pushing heavily on me. Not sure if this is supposed to be a trait of good town, something coming from stubborn town, or scummy. Still, I am thinking the chance of him being town are more likely than him being scum.<br>\n-----<br>\npisskop &#8211; self voted himself on d1 &#8211; typically an anti-town move but in the context he did it for, to get some conversation going, along with his continued behavior in trying to figure things out &#8211; I&#8217;m willing to give him benefit of the doubt that he&#8217;s town. However, his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7562846#p7562846\">270</a> post wasn't helpful, it came off as scum AtE to me. Yet in post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7557723#p7557723\">170</a>, he&#8217;s trying to help us better figure out AI&#8217;s alignment&#8230;and seems genuinely frustrated about thinking AI was scum. <br>\n<br>\nHe's much more involved here, than when he's scum. When he was scum against PantherPunt and scum against me, he posted extremely brief posts that didn't dig deeper than the surface. He was still posting very much but the depth of his posts weren't apparent in those games, when he was scum. Here, he's providing info and pressuring people.<br>\n<br>\nSomething that is still strange to me, was this post of his to droog: &#8220;Then vote. Id love to 1v1 you. You arent good enough to beat me.&#8221;<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#0080BF\">Null <br>\n</div><br>\n<br>\nBoon &#8211; his posts since his replace-in earlier in d1, have touched on Droog/pk/Ircher. His predecessor voted pk, Boon unvoted him. His posts looked like he&#8217;s just standing on the periphery regarding those 3, and his lurking to me, it was scummy.<br>\n<br>\nAt first his play before his first big post of d1, appeared to resemble the game where he was scum versus Keys  &amp; I.<br>\n<br>\nThen his  <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7574431#p7574431\">611</a> &amp; <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7574436#p7574436\">612</a> defense against my pressure on him, actually sounded sensible to me. His scumread of Rask at the time of his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7574431#p7574431\">611</a> post , was still odd.<br>\n<br>\nAnother positive from Boon is that he&#8217;s been consistent from d1 to d2, as represented by his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7595948#p7595948\">913</a> post in voting for his 3 scumreads between Ras/Ircher/me.<br>\n<br>\nHowever, Boon is notorious for lurking - he even admitted it, and he lurked in the large normal I played with him and Keyser. This isn't a comfortable thought to me.<br>\n<br>\nMy read evolved on him and I put him at null.<br>\n-----<br>\nmassive &#8211; disliked how he stated he&#8217;s easy to read as every alignment. His catch-up after the weekend  on pg 30, looked like empty posting. His <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7579227#p7579227\">754</a> was alright, as he ended it with stating things that sound like typical town - sure on a few things, unsure on a few things. <br>\n<br>\nLater on in d2, he posted nothing that stood out as scummy.<br>\n<br>\nOn d2, I went through a few of massive's scum games again, compared them to the one where him and I were town, as well as this one. He did vote Rask but he&#8217;s had no vote from what I recall, on all of d2.

Deus was a slot that seemed to be doing substantial detective work, and his vote on pk during pk&#8217;s interaction with him to post more, looked like honest scumhunting from Deus.  <br>\n<br>\nAlso, Ras&#8217;s <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7567859#p7567859\">392</a> about rallying votes onto Deus/Golden, made me townread Golden. But nothing even came out of that. <br>\n<br>\nGolden unvoted pisskop, posted near deadline, and ended up not voting on d1. This sequence is still suspicious to me &#8211; his reason of no vote being he forgot to vote because he had an interview.<br>\n<br>\nMoreso, Golden claimed to have gut townread me in his posts 906-989.

He continues the passive aggressive charade for my death, with <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7615219#p7615219\">1112</a> &amp; <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7615250#p7615250\">1114</a>. massive, you recall the last time FB used \"gut\" to read people? He turned out scummy. This is a similar case with this slot, in addition - Golden is fine with my lynch . Wow. That doesn't add up to him being town.<br>\n<br>\nHis scumreads include Heat/UTL &#8211; he thought one of them is scum.

Then only 3 hours later, he unvotes Ircher. His continued desire for AI's death on d1, his vote on AI since the RVS, and the rest of his sparse ISO , doesn&#8217;t add up to being town. <br>\nLater he replied to my pressure about his unvote of Ircher and addresses my skepticism of him leaving his vote on AI, in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7604937#p7604937\">1016</a> &amp; <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7604948#p7604948\">1017</a> &#8211; both which could easily be faked as scum. <br>\nOn top of that, he votes me because of the &#8220;speed&#8221; of UTL&#8217;s wagon compared to mine, being his basis for voting me&#8230;you&#8217;ve got to be kidding me.

That doesn&#8217;t follow neatly.<br>\n<br>\nIn the same post reply, he stated he agreed with AI more than he thought he would...which I think is a scummy excuse for creating fluff.  Later on, he added the UTL &amp; Heat 2 to his townreads, which caused me to null read him.<br>\n<br>\nThen his peculiar <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7572483#p7572483\">485</a> regarding Boon, his bare agreement with AI's reads, the oddness of his posts, his erroneous scumread of me, his exclusion of Rask in the below reads list from him - I&#8217;m back to scumreading droog.<br>\n<br>\nSomething about Rask &amp; droog's interactions about droog voting Rask, is peculiar. Rask expected droog to get called out on hammering him out of cowardice - cowardice because droog was bussing his partner, is my thought. <br>\n<br>\nThen RC replaces in within 3 days of d2 deadline, but told us he hasn&#8217;t caught up. The entirety of his ISO is about catching up and indecisiveness &#8211; the latter being a classic scum tell.

Good posts with substance. <br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Null</div> <br>\nBoon - Not paid much attention to him. <br>\nRC - Not caught up. <br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Leaning Scum </div><br>\nUTL - I'm actually reconsidering this scum read partly due to the change in vote from PK to UTL.

No reasoning to back it up?<br>\nPerformer - When I talked about the gut read, he switched me from slightly town to scum. Not only does this seem like an overreaction, but the possibility that scum performer realises he's on his last legs, and is trying to find someone else who looks scummier could be quite possible.<br>\n<br>\nI know, I know.

His explanation for the self-vote? To preserve meta........<br>\nEventually, he starts participating.....<br>\nD2 - When RC replaces in, he demands RC to join the Performer wagon<br>\nLater, he switches to UTL<br>\nWhen questioned by Golden to explain his change, PK refuses to respond.<br>\nFinally, he continues to refuse to explain his change causing massive to hammer performer. <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\"><br>\n<br>\nSo yeah, I'm not so sure this slot is town anymore.

There do also exist towny possible reasons to adopt stance like that, and at this time I have no expressed opinion about whether you are doing like that(for a towny reason) or not. (also I have not actually drawn that conclusion, youd need to have started actually playing the game, for me to make judgments like that.)<br>\n<br>\nIf i was just reading your play this game your slot would have significantly different read to what Droog made of it before he left.<br>\n<br>\nSo pulling things in isolation like, \"RC is reluctant to vote GR, is not all that useful\", analysing or requesting analysis of points in isolation like that is bad.

Indeed reading the thread and trying to work it out would have made it abundantly clear that was not what was going on.<br>\nYou by way of contrast &gt;claimed&lt; not to understand that, you have effectively by your loose/bad PR related play, claimed vanilla town, go you, now your survival which apparently is way more important to you than your town wincon is greatly enhanced.  <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">or</div> ... that would also be &gt;&gt;consistent&lt;&lt; with a scum RC trying to establish in advance reason why they have not been night killed. That is becuase IMO RC, is so frequently sure they are so good and dangerous to scum that RC is bound to be the night kill. So as scum I expect you will frequently try and establish reasons your not dead.

(Not a D1 problem).<br>\n<br>\nReturning to Keyser... <br>\nSo Keysers direction flipped suddenly, I have difficulty trying to work out which kinds of reactions and direction changes were in fact motivated by guessing the play might be role related (Which can easily make townies flipping their read look to be fabricating reasons, because they are), <br>\nwhich were genuine reads that the person is actually in the right place just doing it badly.<br>\nHere is Keyser and pisskop agreeing with a \"reason\", they thought AI was trying to force us out of LYLO. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7555397#p7555397\">104</a><br>\n<br>\nHere is me slowing down the progress, of my and your discussion <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7553629#p7553629\">90</a>, because i need to be able to temporarily walk away from a scum read on you if I am not going to flat out confront AI big time D1.<br>\n(also because I thought time would indeed help)<br>\nHere is me putting it on the never never <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7555889#p7555889\">116</a> <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7556078#p7556078\">118</a><br>\n<br>\nI had already (at 90) decided to go elsewhere that day, but did not want to be seen turning so close to me noticing Keyser turn.<br>\n<br>\nBasically from my own knowledge and my own best guesses, some creative truth telling may have happened D1.</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\nOh well when i wrote the above spoiler, I dipped into other peoples reactions a bit.

Like, <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7577323#p7577323\" class=\"postlink\">698</a> is fine but it's almost like Heat is a hydra and the other head started posting, and there's suddenly not a lot of content in the posts and I get to <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7611305#p7611305\" class=\"postlink\">1056</a> and was like wha huh? (Yes I realize Heat is not a hydra, what I mean is that his content changed unexpectedly, which could be to divert attention.) I do like 1056 though, did Heat follow-up on looking at AI? Nope and he forgets he already unvoted Ircher when he moves onto Performer (L-1) in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7618654#p7618654\" class=\"postlink\">1137</a> ... at this point he has mentioned Performer / interacted with Performer only once (in a joke post no less) up to listing him on par with Ircher as a scumread in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7597074#p7597074\" class=\"postlink\">917</a>?

{"number": 1653, "id": "7642510", "user": "Ircher", "user_id": "26976", "content": "The key in analyzing AI imo was the fact that he didn't seem the most logical nk. Sure, he was a nuisance and may be a bit difficult to lynch, but imo, there seemed to be way better canidates than AI for the n1 nk (most notably Keyser).<br>\n<br>\nSo, as I understand, Axle believes that AI was mainly nk'd cuz scum thought there was a high prob. of him being a PR. It is a reasonable conclusion, and in retrospect, it makes a lot of sense, although I never considered that explanation earlier. (Part of the reason why I asked someone else's opinion on the matter).<br>\n<br>\nNow, at this point, I'm a bit lost (actually a lot). I haven't been following as well with everything (Axle can have...&#160; eh poor grammar a lot which can make it quite difficult sometimes). For the most part, I just feel that this game has too many people who are just goofing off or apathetic rather than actually trying to solve the game. One thing that I know for sure is that not a single one of us has any real idea as to where this game is going (well, that's not strictly the truth, but you get the gist). Most games have some kind of leader by this point, and if I'm not mistaken, Keyser was our leader ('least D2) and he's been nk'd and we have yet to chosen a successor.<br>\n<br>\nGoing back to D1, one of Rask's last posts included UTL, Axle, and Droog as the people he wanted lynch. As of right now, none of them have been lynched. Now, I'm delving in to the wifom territory, but let's consider why he wants each of these guys lynched.<br>\n<br>\nIf UTL is town: then it seems to me that Ras was taking advantage of the fact that a lot of people scumread him, so in essence, he was going for an easy mislynch on UTL. On the other hand, if UTL is scum, then this is an attempt to distance himself from one of his partners.<br>\n<br>\nWe know that for balance purposes, at least one of the people Ras listed has to be town. I'm thinking he most likely included Axle because he knew Axle was town and he knew that Axle was unlikely to be lynched. It was an attempt to cast doubt on a person who few people scumread. It had no point other than to try to make us second-guess each other.<br>\n<br>\nFinally, we have Droog. Overall, I must say that I was pretty satisfied with Droog's play; however, I am rather displeased with RC's play. Nonetheless, I am thinking that RC is more likely town and that RC is following his meta that I prob. won't read. So, this slot is prob. also town.<br>\n<br>\nWith that being said, (this is the part that is def. subj. to fallancies), do you think that Ras would've on purposely included only players he knew were town? I think its plausible, as it would be a bit out of the normal flow and ebb of the game. People wouldn't expect it from scum as they would a mixed group.<br>\n<br>\nWith that being said, I think I'd prefer lynching Heat before UTL.<br>\n<br>\nLast of all --&gt; What happened to the GR wagon??? RC dismantled almost the entire wagon! If we're going to lynch for info as PK suggested, I would think a Heat flip bit more informative than lynching GR.<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: Golden Robster</span><br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Heat</span>", "time": "Mon Feb 08, 2016 11:31 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=64916&start=1650", "forum": "53", "thread": "64916"}

My problem was i knew where the friendly neighbor and last power role was, so as scum has hit 3 for 3 power roles this game they might too. The value of a continuing charade seemed marginal. Also there exists the ??? possibility if PK, really denies knowledge of the PM, that boon had some kind of plan and it involved some confusion about where his PMs had gone, and for example heat picking up the vibe, acting as if they knew Boon was a FN, then boon killing everyone else and puppeting heat to victory?

PK was annoying the heck out of me, but I really didn't feel PK was scum. Hence, the reason I didn't act proactively in my PL suggestion.</div><br>\n<br>\n3. I am the first person to vocalize a scumread of Ras; I did so in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7559225#p7559225\">213</a>; furthermore, I voted Ras in that post. Really consider that before lynching me, it is prob. one of the few things that I've done in this game that kinda fits site norm.<br>\n<br>\n4. Later on, I have a little clash with Droog. Upon looking back over it, my reaction was more \"Droog seems to be scumreading me for poor reasons\" rather than an actual scummy feel to it. What I am saying is that it wasn't like Droog was dropping scumtells, it was more that I found him opportunistic because he seemed to scumread me for reasons I thought were unreasonable. Am I being clear here?<br>\n<br>\n5. One thing I would like to point out in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7569900#p7569900\">418</a> is the fact I <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">generally</div> agreed with what Ras said. I didn't say I completely agreed, I really didn't say I mostly agreed with Ras's post that I quoted. I actually said that I agreed with the general ideas in Ras's post. Huge difference between the two imho.<br>\n<br>\n6. By <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7573063#p7573063\">558</a>, I've changed from Droog to Boon. Apparently, my reasoning was AI's read and the fact that Boon was lurking. - <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">First of all, I probably valued AI's opinion the most out of all of you early game; mainly because I played with him before. Next, as I later realized this game, activity truly is a null tell, but I was the mindset that if they weren't active, they were scum lurking around. In truthfulness, I ought to lynch myself based off of that reasoning as everyone gets busy at times. So, yeah, this wasn' my best move, but it could be worse -- I could just switch without any reason. And I'm sure there are worse reasons for voting him at the time than activity.<br>\n<br>\n7. Boon accuses me of making fluff. In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7575803#p7575803\">659</a>, I challenge him to highlight some of it. - <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">In hindsight, the way I worded that post is kinda scummy. While the premise is reasonable, I think I could've made my challenge in a way that sounded less defensive, etc.</div><br>\n<br>\n8. One thing that is notable in D1 is that of all my scumreads, I only consistently kept 1. That read was Ras -- from beginning to end, I scumread him. Why did I scumread other people, well, as a person elsewhere put it, I'm a reflexive voter. I tend to vote anyone who jumps on me cuz I think I'm not acting scummy but truly I do do things that look very culpable. Ras was the only person that day that I scumread for a reason besides activity or scumreading me. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">@Ras (For Post-Game) --&gt; I am a bit disappointed. You probably could've fooled me if you tried a bit harder and stayed engaged in the game even after your crucial mistake. It was your lack of commitment, of fighting to survive, that ultimately got you lynched. Keep that in mind the next time you are scum.</div><br>\n<br>\n9. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7575902#p7575902\">664</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7576042#p7576042\">667</a> are fun, joking posts that shouldn't be taken as alignment indicative.<br>\n<br>\n10. Ok, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7578206#p7578206\">722</a> just sounds wrong. First of all it is a logical fallancy (not that I really care. Also, I'm hinting at a possibility of me being scum. Despite the way it sounds, I actually like the post; context is the key here. In this case, we have Boon tunnelling me hardcore. So, what I am effectively doing here is suggesting that if he would look at it at a more neutral standpoint, he may not see as much scum in me. Aka, this post is a good example where context and interpretation matter a lot --&gt; Boon thought it was scumslip which it is if you just skim over it. If you understand the context though, you will realize it is more of a post that a frustrated townie would make.<br>\n<br>\n11. I remind people in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7581031#p7581031\">756</a> that deadline is approaching. - <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">This is me shooting for towncred, but think about it. Scum could VERY EASILY just \"ignore\" the deadline and later pretend they didn't notice; they would IMHO prefer NOT to mention that a deadline is looming, ESPECIALLY when the obvious lynch at the time is one of their buddies. No lynch in general hurts town, and scum would PREFER no lynch over the lynch of their buddy. Just my own attempt to garner towncred, just don't all me out on it, as I'm being honest. Oh and last of all, you must always consider the sum of the actions, one little instance like this is never something you should base your entire read upon.</div><br>\n<br>\n12. As I demonstrated throughout this game, I always maximize daytime if it is in my control. One such post is <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7584853#p7584853\">814</a> where I unvote Ras despite knowing that he is almost certainly the D1 lynch and there is almost no more discussion to take place. - <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">I prefer if you don't take these things as alignment indicative, it is just the way I play. In general, more time imo means more time to find scum and their partners, so it is my opinion that unless the next lynch will end the game REGARDLESS of flip, time shouldn't be cut short.</div><br>\n<br>\n13. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7585605#p7585605\">826</a> is my final D1 post. I made a total of 63 posts that day out of about 860 or so posts.<br>\n<br>\n14. My notes in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7594344#p7594344\">877</a> are still somewhat relevant and should definitely be reviewed. One of the few times this game I've paid close attention to stuff. Some interesting things --&gt; Droog vs. PK I marked as TvT, so that furthers my PK townread. Point 19 is kinda interesting albeit no longer relevant. Still useful to consider though.<br>\n<br>\n15. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7600109#p7600109\">971</a> began a mini off-topic discussion.<br>\n<br>\n16. Around the <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7603156#p7603156\">1000</a>s, I'm trying to use activity to show that Massive is scummy. - <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">If I were more experienced, I would probably say that most people would find that opportunistic. The thing is I'm not; I am just now starting to understand why activity is non-alignment indicative. I'm also starting to understand how meta affects reads -- that has greatly influenced my read of PK throughout the game. I never read meta, but I ought to. Just as I tend to be seen as a good mislynch target, so do other people have their own metas they follow. I really at least give them more weight than I have; sure, you can manipulate them, but that isn't normally the case and I shouldn't just flagrantly disregard it. As I like to say, it is simply another tool to be used. Not too much but not too little emphasis on it.</div><br>\n<br>\n17. In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7610371#p7610371\">1040</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7610407#p7610407\">1044</a>, I pose a question to UTL. The question is simply whether scum would generally tend to write posts like <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7594344#p7594344\">877</a> during the night phase. When UTL gave me his specific answer (I wanted the more general answer), I asked for a clarification. - <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">I won't lie to myself, it certainly does look like an attempt for towncred, esp. the 2nd question. But, again, I think context is important and that the fact I asked that first question is also imperative.</div><br>\n<br>\n18. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7614386#p7614386\">1098</a> is important. I voted UTL over Performer NOT because I thought UTL was scummier BUT because I didn't want to hammer Performer.<br>\n<br>\n19. I made a pretty good point to Boon in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7634077#p7634077\">1387</a>. And quite frankly, I think it made quite a difference in his outlook on me. Personally, I do try to keep an unbiased perspective, which often leads to trouble. Basically, what I'm saying here is that everyone has a different POV and sometimes you get really biased (tunnel vision). But, when people point out your tunnel, you should step back for a minute (or more) and reconsider your view to determine if what you think is based on facts or your outlook.<br>\n<br>\n20. Post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7636183#p7636183\">1488</a> ended up being a lot more of a link dump than anything. This was mainly because not too much interesting stuff happened in D2 til like the last 3 or so days. Nonetheless, even link dumps have their purposes: quick access to relevent info, so I'd say the post was worth it.<br>\n<br>\n21. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7655157#p7655157\">1854</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7656916#p7656916\">1893</a> seem a bit weird. So, as crazy as this sounds, I thought that by voting my biggest townread, I'd get a reaction out of someone. When I noticed everyone ignored it, I think I realized I was too blatant about it. Scum could see the trap too easily and avoid it. So, obviously, it didn't work, BUT it shows people are engaged in this game and are paying significant attention to it.</div></div></div></div><br>\nAnd, that's it!

Towards the end of <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7576723#p7576723\">680</a>, Axle mentions the fact that he saw two jesters yet it was a normal game. In a much later post, he says that the two he felt were jesters were AI and me (didn't realize he thought I was trying to get lynched.....). I'm just curious as to why this fact was important, did it really matter that you thought there was two jesters in the game, yet knew there couldn't be? Meh, I'll give it a null read.<br>\n<br>\n5.

This really didn't look like WK of a scumbuddy, it seems more like scum trying to get towncred off of someone they **know** are town but failed epicly at.<br>\n<br>\n2. PK's disinterest (self-vote to prove a point, etc) at the beginning of the game. PK has said himself that he loves to play as scum, much more so than as town. So, PK's lack of interest at the beginning could be used as a sign he's town --&gt; He wasn't interested cuz he didn't roll scum.<br>\n<br>\n3. The way PK switched wagons D2..... While I'd still like a reason for it, I feel that it wasn't just a move to try to garner towncred by jumping off the wagon of a person he **knew 100%** was town.<br>\n<br>\n4. Similarly, PK began to feel GR was town during D4. Once again, I get town vibes; if you think  about it, the reasons against GR weren't very extreme, and myself was starting to think he was town. Unlike UTL and Ras, GR DID seem to be trying to engage and help town, he just failed to.<br>\n<br>\n5. Idc what you say, but it was not 100% obvious that Boon was town after his hammer D3. The very fact that PK missed the pm from Boon loojs very genuine. Plus, PK did imo have the option to deny the pm, and when Boon flips later, if he's questioned about it, he could mention the fact that town has a roleblocker who could've roleblocked Boon D1.<br>\n<br>\n6. D1, I saw what looked like a TvT fight between him and AI, as both were using poor reasoning to say the other was scum.

Sure, he was a nuisance and may be a bit difficult to lynch, but imo, there seemed to be way better canidates than AI for the n1 nk (most notably Keyser).<br>\n<br>\nSo, as I understand, Axle believes that AI was mainly nk'd cuz scum thought there was a high prob. of him being a PR. It is a reasonable conclusion, and in retrospect, it makes a lot of sense, although I never considered that explanation earlier. (Part of the reason why I asked someone else's opinion on the matter).<br>\n<br>\nNow, at this point, I'm a bit lost (actually a lot). I haven't been following as well with everything (Axle can have...&#160; eh poor grammar a lot which can make it quite difficult sometimes). For the most part, I just feel that this game has too many people who are just goofing off or apathetic rather than actually trying to solve the game. One thing that I know for sure is that not a single one of us has any real idea as to where this game is going (well, that's not strictly the truth, but you get the gist). Most games have some kind of leader by this point, and if I'm not mistaken, Keyser was our leader ('least D2) and he's been nk'd and we have yet to chosen a successor.<br>\n<br>\nGoing back to D1, one of Rask's last posts included UTL, Axle, and Droog as the people he wanted lynch. As of right now, none of them have been lynched. Now, I'm delving in to the wifom territory, but let's consider why he wants each of these guys lynched.<br>\n<br>\nIf UTL is town: then it seems to me that Ras was taking advantage of the fact that a lot of people scumread him, so in essence, he was going for an easy mislynch on UTL. On the other hand, if UTL is scum, then this is an attempt to distance himself from one of his partners.<br>\n<br>\nWe know that for balance purposes, at least one of the people Ras listed has to be town. I'm thinking he most likely included Axle because he knew Axle was town and he knew that Axle was unlikely to be lynched. It was an attempt to cast doubt on a person who few people scumread. It had no point other than to try to make us second-guess each other.<br>\n<br>\nFinally, we have Droog. Overall, I must say that I was pretty satisfied with Droog's play; however, I am rather displeased with RC's play. Nonetheless, I am thinking that RC is more likely town and that RC is following his meta that I prob. won't read. So, this slot is prob. also town.<br>\n<br>\nWith that being said, (this is the part that is def. subj. to fallancies), do you think that Ras would've on purposely included only players he knew were town? I think its plausible, as it would be a bit out of the normal flow and ebb of the game. People wouldn't expect it from scum as they would a mixed group.<br>\n<br>\nWith that being said, I think I'd prefer lynching Heat before UTL.<br>\n<br>\nLast of all --&gt; What happened to the GR wagon??? RC dismantled almost the entire wagon! If we're going to lynch for info as PK suggested, I would think a Heat flip bit more informative than lynching GR.<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: Golden Robster</span><br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Heat</span></div></blockquote><br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7643065#p7643065\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7643065#p7643065\" data-post-id=\"7643065\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 1687</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=26976\">Ircher</a> wrote:</cite>Yeah, kinda.<br>\n<br>\nMy gist was that it was very possible that in his wifom, Ras decided to give the names of 3 townies rather than go for the more standard mixed group.

Regardless of the case, I see a genuine reason for Heat to express suspicion of me here, and that healthy suspicion leads to a townread.</div><br>\n<br>\n2. The associative case of <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7557959#p7557959\">194</a> by Ras also leads to a townread.<br>\n<br>\n3. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7557994#p7557994\">198</a> does not look like scum asking scum questions. - <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Again, what I see motive wise here is Heat wants to know why Ras gives him a bare townread. I don't see any hidden pretexts here.</div><br>\n<br>\n4. Early on, AI expresses a scumread of Heat for \"opportunistically voting Ircher\". The logical reaction as conducted by Heat is to scumread AI, esp. considering AI wasn't supporting his read at all. - <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Again, you notice the pattern -- even if Heat may be wrong, etc, Heat has yet to show any scum motive in his actions.</div><br>\n<br>\n5. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7610603#p7610603\">1049</a> by Heat follows the pattern.<br>\n<br>\n6. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7634838#p7634838\">1417</a> by Heat is an example of a concept called \"empathy\". - <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">What I like a lot about this post is the fact that Heat was not only able to consider the possibility I was town, but he also thought about how he would react in such a position. Sure, scum could make such a post, but when the target is very likely to get lynched eventually, that just seems like it's making scum's job harder. The way Heat was able to see my perspective and think about it from an unbiased perspective really makes me townread him. Empathy is a concept I think Boon couldn't understand well this game.</div></div></div></div><br>\n<br>\nSo, my strongest townread right now is actually Heat.<br>\n<br>\nI've already explained my view of PK though I gotta keep in mind he can be sneaky at scum, aka, someone to look at during lylo.<br>\n<br>\nFinally, I have a mild townlean on Axle as I don't see him pushing a scum agenda. Unfortunately, his analysis of stuff is a good way to keep suspicion off of him. Now that I spilled the beans about Axle and tonights nk, I wouldn't be surprised if scum choose a different target. (Thanks a lot, Axle <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":|\" title=\"Neutral\"> )<br>\n<br>\nThat leaves me with Massive. Massive has done very little scumhunting and partially wants to lynch me just because I added in a part tellling him not to hammer Axle. It is no unheard of for someone to just go hammer someone early, so I added it as a precaution to allow Axle some time to speak, and what I get out of it is apparently a scumread (granted its not the only reason) and a L-1 vote.<br>\n<br>\n@PK<br>\nI'm fine with an Axle lynch but would prefer a Massive lynch. Massive looks more opportunistic in his voting of me than Axle does. Axle has at least explained his read whereas Massive is not expressing his views well and continues to use his meta as an excuse for providing virtually zero useful content. While with all the other slots, I actually see good reasons to townread them, I do not with Massive.<br>\n<br>\nAssuming:<br>\n<br>\n1. Lynch Massive, Axle NK'd --&gt; I would lynch PK next simply because I'm town and PK acts the same regardless of alignment.<br>\n<br>\n2. Lynch Massive, Someone else NK'd --&gt; I would lynch Axle<br>\n<br>\n3. Lynch Axle, I'm NK'd (doubtful) --&gt; Lynch Massive<br>\n<br>\n4. Lynch Axle, Massive NK'd --&gt; Would reexamine evidence. (PK may not have a motive for NKing Massive)<br>\n<br>\n5. Lynch Axle, Someone else NK'd --&gt; Lynch Massive<br>\n<br>\n6. Lynch Ircher, Axle NK'd --&gt; Please lynch Massive<br>\n<br>\n7.

Also, when people like pk, Ircher , and Axle put in so much effort (as seen in their proactive posting this game), that tends to be a town sign. You also should discern whether a player is town frustrated or scum feigning town frustration. This is a subtle thing but with more games, you should be able to tune that skill as a town player.<br>\nI hope you continue improving and use this game as a big learning experience.

(3) is also an extremely rare situation and there are usually better and more simple alternatives.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7433633#p7433633\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7433633#p7433633\" data-post-id=\"7433633\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 53</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=22396\">pieguyn</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7432420#p7432420\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7432420#p7432420\" data-post-id=\"7432420\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 36</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=11238\">Antihero</a> wrote:</cite>fakeclaiming as town is about the equivalent of pulling down your pants and taking a dump on the board while playing a board game.<br>\n<br>\nit might not be the worst thing anyone can do but it's still inconsiderate and annoying.</div></blockquote><br>\nI love you.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7431805#p7431805\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7431805#p7431805\" data-post-id=\"7431805\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 31</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=24704\">Cheetory6</a> wrote:</cite>What about underclaiming your results?<br>\nLike saying youre a weaker version of your role to try and get maximal value out of it?</div></blockquote><br>\ni.e., claiming \"2-shot Informed Tracker\" as a full gunsmith and mindfucking me cos I didn't stop to realize you had a role that would have allowed you to get another inno?  yes <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\"><br>\n<br>\nclaiming a tracker guilty when you have a cop guilty is one I also used to hear about a lot but I hardly ever see it done now</div></blockquote><br>\nI am against taking dump on the board while playing board game with people.

Shock.<br>\nSo why the hell do any town players EVER allow themselves to self-vote? You're voting a confirmed town at that stage - that is playing against your wincon, quite frankly. Honestly, if I think i could get away with it I'd petition the board to make that a universally accepted rule that, as town, a self vote is playing against wincon and is thus bannable. That's about how much I'm offended by it when any town player does it.<br>\n<br>\nAnd the benefits for scum? Literally half of them are only there because derp town chooses to self vote as a rage quit type option or as their only answer to a wagon/case.<br>\n<br>\nI used self-voting as scum early in my career to get town read or to dismantle wagons on me. Recently, as an alt account, I used it again, and it worked beautifully. Everyone was all like 'oh dear, look at that poor frustrated town, unvote!' and I skunked a win for my scum team.

Why should town need to try to sort out whether someone is a derp town or a vile scum just due to a single vote?<br>\n<br>\nI am really making this as a rallying cry.<br>\nI want self-votes to become the purview of only scum - and thus crush them as a scum tool barring self-hammers.<br>\nAll it takes is for people to stop self-voting and also to stop treating a self vote as anything but null, and eventually as a scum tell as we weed it out.<br>\nThe only reason I can personally think of for people to keep self voting as town is to defend the tool for their scum game - and I don't need you bolstering your weak scum play by tanking your town games.

What was the plan in bringing up the whole FN bit.<br>\n<br>\nDo note that if scum tried, and worked at like i did overnight they could have become certain that you were in fact the FN.<br>\nWhen they shot RC, I kinda expected they had guessed RC was PR too due to having the gumption to fake claim, but I knew (or think I do) that RC will pull that as any alignment with or without a role.<br>\n<br>\nHowever for RC to be so hard fishing for the PRs earlier meant he likely knew where all the PRs were. <br>\nSo if you were the FN he was seemingly some other role, who went fishing for what he thought was scum feeling out for fake claim.<br>\n(ALLLL the PR stuff was bad from that respect, the best way not to leak PR tells is to play as if you are actually a VT.)<br>\n<br>\nYou had all sorts of crumbs and tells during the day for scum to sort it out once, you raised the idea.<br>\nIt was a fake claim. It was not one of the specific exceptions, it was bad. It was relatively transparent.<br>\nI have seen the scum QT, and yes at some point in time they had indeed believed various claims and not seen through them.<br>\n<br>\nYour damn lucky i wasnt scum or Id have shot you both... Oh wait scum did that anyways.<br>\n<br>\nRegarding RC's RB. Please show me evidence that RC doesn't regularly flap read around like the wind and change their reads and night actions willy nilly.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nSo yours was a good fake claim gambit?<br>\nI am sure Mina will update her advice accordingly.", "time": "Tue Mar 01, 2016 3:04 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=64916&start=2375", "forum": "53", "thread": "64916"}
