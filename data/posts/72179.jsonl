I'm just joking about him lurking. <br>\n<br>\nSo every time I make a post that contains something like lightheartedness and/or AtE I'm scum? What the..... People so need to know my playing style, but then that would be bad for me when I'm actual scum xD Ok, when I'm town I goof off. I'm care free because I have nothing to hide. When I'm scum, I try hard and more serious. <br>\nEmpiricus and Klazam can confirm this. Well, I know Klazam can but idk about Emp tho. If klazam says no, he's lying omg. <br>\nAnyway, my votes stays on Klazam because he's scum. Please vote scum, unless you're scum too, which I think you might be scum. I'm thinking now you are defending him because he's your scum buddy. <br>\n<br>\nAnyway, keep the game from moving forward? I'm bored, jesus. There's not enough people active to actually keep the game moving forward. <br>\n<br>\nOk Honestly, I'm not saying you could be scum because you're thinking I'm scum, I'm thinking you're scum because of trying to put Towny behavior. I feel like you're trying too hard to scum hunt, trying too hard to find scummies. Towns usually relax and think through and here you are asking almost everyone why they voted, etc etc. If you were to target someone else I would still question you anyway. <br>\n<br>\nI even said I have no evidence. What kind of scum would say that? NADA, at least I think xD <br>\n<br>\nI don't remember saying I'm against scum hunting, too lazy to look back as I am writing this. However, Scumhunting is fine, I'm just saying I will still lynch someone although that person is scumhunting due to experience. Like you for example, you're scum hunting, hats off to you, but are you really because you seem like you're doing it too hard. <br>\n<br>\nBut hey, my vote still stays on Klazam. He's scum, PERIOD.

Null on everyone else because it is hard to go through 17 pages of mostly shitposting (again, please lets not keep doing this)</div></blockquote>\n\nShit posting.... well i guess im a shitposter. <br>\n<br>\nTrying too hard to be likable? Ugh this game in general honestly. Makes me less motivated to play since there are too many people in here that are like \"fake reactions. fake emotions, trying to fake, fake trying too hard to be likable, light hearted etc.\" This game should have like a webcam game or something. Would be awesome. THEN yall would know my light hearted personality wouldn't be so fake xD Fine fuck it, lynch me then yall see how real i am. I honestly dare you all. <br>\n<br>\nNo promises on not shitposting tho. <br>\n<br>\nYeah, Im TR on Trivium.", "time": "Mon Jun 12, 2017 6:44 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=72179&start=400", "forum": "53", "thread": "72179"}

Obvious pro is if he is scum, we hit scum on D1. A lot of his posts have pinged me, especially the way he flip flops constantly (see above lol) I also like the read someone gave based on his previous game, saying that he did not sound the same. I'll verify that and read his existing meta when I get a second. <br>\n<br>\nI understand that it could possibly be scum trying to push an easy mislynch maybe, but even if Serg is town, his flip would reveal a lot of information I feel like. Since he has been posting SO MUCH, it would be easy to go back after his flip and analyze his voting, who he was scumreading etc.<br>\n<br>\nAlso tbh I haven't properly caught up with the game since I last posted, I'll do that after work today, but just wanted to ask this Q first</div></blockquote>\nI know exactly what type of player serg is, and I also know that it's the easies mislynch in the world. Why are you and Carcalilly claiming we can get anything out of his reads afterwards if he's town? Scum are the only ones who know alignments for sure, so lynching scum shows us much, much more about the game than lynching town would. Sure he's posted a lot, but like 80% of it is joke posting. <br>\n<br>\nI don't want to come off as having some kind of better opinion than anyone else, but I've lurked a long time on this site, and I've read through a metric ton of games. My main point here is that whenever there's one player who jokes around and posts more than any other player, basically doing exactly what serg is doing now, <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">nearly every single game</div> that person is lynched and they flip town.

But compared to the loss of other members of they were to flip town would be more detrimental in my opinion.

You try to seem town and it doesn't feel natural. then you made your huge \"case\" and dropped a vote and the entire thing seemed forced and the reasons haven't been very good. I don't like the way you are dancing around this taco pressure. It feels to me like you know he is going to flip town. I think the straw that broke the camel's back was when you said there would only be a con to lynching taco if he was some sort of PR. Losing any townie is a con.

I've seen scum post a lot, but the thing is that scum tend to post things that I don't really find a place for, or things that lead me to only one place. That's how lies work, they lead you to a single conclusion and that's it. That's why I'm townreading serg and carcalilly so much, and I know this sounds super vague but I can't be bothered to quote posts, I expect everybody who's going to reply to this to actually have read the game at an analysis level, but generally the way carcalilly and serg have been acting doesn't lead me to one place, it seems like actual content that makes me think about what's happening in the game. Tchill and empiricus don't come across that way, for the main point of this game they both seem to be been posting in ways that seem like they're trying to add to discussion without really doing so in a way I feel is towny and not goal focused in a scummy way. I don't necessarily think either of them are scum because of this, but the fact that I don't really see them as towny makes me feel uncomfortable. Twoface comes across as the type of player I'd want to lynch in a normal game, but I've read into his meta a little bit, and though I hate making decisions based on meta I've decided he's probably just being the way he is playing town. I don't like mulch either, he keeps mentioning he needs to read through stuff but not really seeming like he has, I dunno, seems like scum skirting. I don't mean any offense to him if that's not the case, but I feel like he's either not on top of the game so far as much as he would be normally, or he's just scum. Branson is probably scum, she plays a really focused analysis with a point to make and drops out, comes back in with a focus and drops again. I'm pretty convinced she's scum even if it's just day one.<br>\n<br>\nThere's a couple of things that really get to me when I play mafia, and one of them is memeposting or shitposting or having a joking attitude all of the time, whatever you want to call it, just because it makes people hard to read for me.

You try to seem town and it doesn't feel natural. then you made your huge \"case\" and dropped a vote and the entire thing seemed forced and the reasons haven't been very good. I don't like the way you are dancing around this taco pressure. It feels to me like you know he is going to flip town. I think the straw that broke the camel's back was when you said there would only be a con to lynching taco if he was some sort of PR. Losing any townie is a con.

Like, he has more analysis than anyone in this game thus far. I like how he brought up wanting to wait for the other people he hasn't interacted with to catch up. He says he's a newer player, but I wouldn't be able to tell from his play thus far. He's coming across as incredibly transparent town to me (if he's scum, he's doing that much better. Strongest town read I got.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF00\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">TwoFace</div></div> - lel. 2f is town.

I actually like Klazam a lot, specifically with his interactions with TwoFace. I liked how he just didn't want to deal with Taco either. I feel like scumKla would go along with it more and potentially get a TvT read out of it. I'm going to lean town here. I understand how my reasons can be criticized with \"He could be scum doing all that.\", but I am town reading the slot. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#0040FF\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Sergtacos</div> </div>- So he's the most active this game, and definitely has the biggest presence. He has a lot of NAI posts, but there are some townie like posts in there. I feel like his posting comes from anxious town trying to figure the game out. He's trying out different things, and I don't think he has solidified his reads yet, it's day 1, they don't have to be, and I feel he's pretty genuine. I'm going to lean town here. It's just too early, and too many NAI posts to make me want to full on town read.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#BF00FF\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Trivium</div></div> - Initially I saw his 2F push as forced, but I understand why people push 2F. I thought I was going to end up scum reading him after reading through the rest, but I generally liked his other stuff. I liked his <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9328241#p9328241\" class=\"postlink\">761</a>. I'll null town here.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#BF00FF\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">shuffleplay</div></div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">(now Vedith)</div> - Eh, shuffle was solid. Not much, but she posted some bricks (not quite walls, but solid amount of content per post), and I feel like she was town trying to be active in the game. I'll null town. Vedith will be active, so I'm not worried about lack of content.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#BF00FF\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Fykus</div></div> - Fykus seems really genuine with the little amount of posts he has, but there's really not that much to go off of.

Like I'm 50/50. His carefree-okaywitheverythingexceptthethingshe'sexplicitlynot-yes man demeanor is hard for me to accept whatever read I pick off. I'll probably need a flip to sort this slot.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF0080\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Carcalilly</div></div> - Okay, yeah. I definitely see why this slot is being scum read. I don't feel like stating more; 2f already did. I can't tell if I see her as scum or town feeling some pressure, and trying to get out of it without drawing more people to her. I'll null scum.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF8000\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Dunkerdoodles</div></div> - Most of the posts were on Taco, and I don't really like the 2F/Mulch scum read in addition to Taco. Not a whole lot to go off of, and if you're town, you're gonna have to show me, but I get big gut scum vibes from here. I'll lean scum.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF0000\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Empiricus</div> </div>- Okay, so you all are going to hate this as a reasoning, but his first post in the game screams scum to me. Like, screams. Like, my ex girlfriend just broke into my house at night, started shrieking, ate my pillow, punched my framed picture of ScarJo, and then stabbed me in the leg with a fork at 2:37 am. It just came off to me as \"Oh, hmm, I need to fabricate a post somewhere. This is an obvious joke! This is funny AND safe! I would say this even if I were town...yeah.\" Scum. This piled onto the fact he is pushing Serg/2F as scum seems like he's not scum hunting, and is just going for people he thinks a wagon could be built upon without him making a case. (he does kind of make cases, but meh. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF0000\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Branson</div></div> - He looks like he's fabricating the hell out his reads. Him pushing Carca looks fake as hell. Like, I agree that Carca seemed scummy, but I just get the feeling Branson saw that and ran with it, ya feel? When I'm scum, I can generally see when town is looking super scummy, and I feel that's what Branson did. I'm solidly scum reading this slot. His read list I felt that all his town reads were him trying to gain rapport and potentially turn into town leader and get them to follow him. If someone makes a case that isn't direct crap, i feel like he'd start pushing down a town read of his. This guy is going for a mislynch, and makes me kind of want to move Carca up a little.

He's trying out different things, and I don't think he has solidified his reads yet, it's day 1, they don't have to be, and I feel he's pretty genuine. I'm going to lean town here.

I'm just joking about him lurking. <br>\n<br>\nSo every time I make a post that contains something like lightheartedness and/or AtE I'm scum? What the..... People so need to know my playing style, but then that would be bad for me when I'm actual scum xD Ok, when I'm town I goof off. I'm care free because I have nothing to hide. When I'm scum, I try hard and more serious. <br>\nEmpiricus and Klazam can confirm this. Well, I know Klazam can but idk about Emp tho. If klazam says no, he's lying omg. <br>\nAnyway, my votes stays on Klazam because he's scum. Please vote scum, unless you're scum too, which I think you might be scum. I'm thinking now you are defending him because he's your scum buddy. <br>\n<br>\nAnyway, keep the game from moving forward? I'm bored, jesus. There's not enough people active to actually keep the game moving forward. <br>\n<br>\nOk Honestly, I'm not saying you could be scum because you're thinking I'm scum, I'm thinking you're scum because of trying to put Towny behavior. I feel like you're trying too hard to scum hunt, trying too hard to find scummies. Towns usually relax and think through and here you are asking almost everyone why they voted, etc etc. If you were to target someone else I would still question you anyway. <br>\n<br>\nI even said I have no evidence. What kind of scum would say that? NADA, at least I think xD <br>\n<br>\nI don't remember saying I'm against scum hunting, too lazy to look back as I am writing this. However, Scumhunting is fine, I'm just saying I will still lynch someone although that person is scumhunting due to experience. Like you for example, you're scum hunting, hats off to you, but are you really because you seem like you're doing it too hard. <br>\n<br>\nBut hey, my vote still stays on Klazam. He's scum, PERIOD. You scum buddy scummy scum you xD</div></blockquote>\n\nThanks for the clarification. O_O Would've been nice earlier...<br>\n<br>\nAs I said, I'm totally chill with lightheartedness. I'm taking into account all the possibilities because why the heck not? It just stuck out to me because you're the most lighthearted player I've met so far (though I haven't played many games.)<br>\n<br>\nAlso, you're really concerning me with the \"no talking about the game irl or elsewhere\" rule. You didn't do anything right??? IT LOOKS LIKE YOU DID SOMETHING,, *sirens in the distance*<br>\n<br>\nI agree there's not enough people, but why clog the thread with useless stuff?<br>\n<br>\nI'm bored and wanna play some MAFIA.</div></blockquote>\n\nI'm bored:  gutreading this town", "time": "Fri Jun 16, 2017 2:05 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=72179&start=850", "forum": "53", "thread": "72179"}

Yeah you can turn that back around on me and say the same thing, but hes got 42 posts in the game already - surely you'd think there'd be some scum hunting interspersed in there. Another thing I noticed is his constant flip flop reads on taco. In the beginning of the game he reads taco as town blah blah blah but as the game goes on (and people started scum reading taco for all of his spam) he changes his reads to fit with everyone else - saying that taco is suddenly scum. Once the wagon on taco fell apart though you can see that he goes back to a strong town read on him again. <br>\n<br>\nAnother thing (probably NAI) is the lack of quoting. Like reading through the ISO is a pain in the ass because you don't know what hes responding to so to get a proper feel of it you have to re-read those sections of the game. Seems like this is a good strategy for scum to adopt, but maybe this is just his playstyle, can anyone vouch for that?<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: klazam</span><br>\n<br>\nI'm confident to put my vote here for the moment.", "time": "Sat Jun 17, 2017 1:46 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=72179&start=1075", "forum": "53", "thread": "72179"}

Like reading through the ISO is a pain in the ass because you don't know what hes responding to so to get a proper feel of it you have to re-read those sections of the game. Seems like this is a good strategy for scum to adopt, but maybe this is just his playstyle, can anyone vouch for that?<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: klazam</span><br>\n<br>\nI'm confident to put my vote here for the moment.</div></blockquote>\n\n<br>\nThis is fair, yeah, i was focusing on trying to get a read on taco, basically all my posts related to him was reaction testing to see if hes behaving as i think he would as town. <br>\n<br>\nme not quoting is mainly because quoting is a pain on my phone. <br>\n<br>\nIm gonna reread the game and then post, then if you still want me hung, feel free.

I would actually rather lynch from lurkers, or someone like Branson, than lynch someone who I can't read very well. I guess that's a double edged sword, because the longer serg is here the more risk is involved, but I think sum have to show their face eventually.

Obvious pro is if he is scum, we hit scum on D1. A lot of his posts have pinged me, especially the way he flip flops constantly (see above lol) I also like the read someone gave based on his previous game, saying that he did not sound the same. I'll verify that and read his existing meta when I get a second. <br>\n<br>\nI understand that it could possibly be scum trying to push an easy mislynch maybe, but even if Serg is town, his flip would reveal a lot of information I feel like. Since he has been posting SO MUCH, it would be easy to go back after his flip and analyze his voting, who he was scumreading etc.<br>\n<br>\nAlso tbh I haven't properly caught up with the game since I last posted, I'll do that after work today, but just wanted to ask this Q first</div></blockquote>\nI know exactly what type of player serg is, and I also know that it's the easies mislynch in the world. Why are you and Carcalilly claiming we can get anything out of his reads afterwards if he's town? Scum are the only ones who know alignments for sure, so lynching scum shows us much, much more about the game than lynching town would. Sure he's posted a lot, but like 80% of it is joke posting. <br>\n<br>\nI don't want to come off as having some kind of better opinion than anyone else, but I've lurked a long time on this site, and I've read through a metric ton of games. My main point here is that whenever there's one player who jokes around and posts more than any other player, basically doing exactly what serg is doing now, <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">nearly every single game</div> that person is lynched and they flip town. I see a pattern, and I want to break it to win.</div></blockquote>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=9330362#p9330362\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=9330362#p9330362\" data-post-id=\"9330362\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 814</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=26322\">Trivium</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=9329934#p9329934\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=9329934#p9329934\" data-post-id=\"9329934\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 810</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=29616\">Tchill13</a> wrote:</cite>I'm a newer player I'm learning as I go but to call it a blatant lie playing according to my beliefs on the game I don't understand.
