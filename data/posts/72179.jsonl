I'm just joking about him lurking. <br><br>So every time I make a post that contains something like lightheartedness and/or AtE I'm scum? What the..... People so need to know my playing style, but then that would be bad for me when I'm actual scum xD Ok, when I'm town I goof off. I'm care free because I have nothing to hide. When I'm scum, I try hard and more serious. <br>Empiricus and Klazam can confirm this. Well, I know Klazam can but idk about Emp tho. If klazam says no, he's lying omg. <br>Anyway, my votes stays on Klazam because he's scum. Please vote scum, unless you're scum too, which I think you might be scum. I'm thinking now you are defending him because he's your scum buddy. <br><br>Anyway, keep the game from moving forward? I'm bored, jesus. There's not enough people active to actually keep the game moving forward. <br><br>Ok Honestly, I'm not saying you could be scum because you're thinking I'm scum, I'm thinking you're scum because of trying to put Towny behavior. I feel like you're trying too hard to scum hunt, trying too hard to find scummies. Towns usually relax and think through and here you are asking almost everyone why they voted, etc etc. If you were to target someone else I would still question you anyway. <br><br>I even said I have no evidence. What kind of scum would say that? NADA, at least I think xD <br><br>I don't remember saying I'm against scum hunting, too lazy to look back as I am writing this. However, Scumhunting is fine, I'm just saying I will still lynch someone although that person is scumhunting due to experience. Like you for example, you're scum hunting, hats off to you, but are you really because you seem like you're doing it too hard. <br><br>But hey, my vote still stays on Klazam. He's scum, PERIOD. You scum buddy scummy scum you xD"}

Something people tell me over and over again. Maybe I'll listen one day. Maybe it'll be this game but for right now I like my vote. If these people somehow redeem themselves I'll back off but I have a very low tolerance for lying. I don't lie as town and as scum I do it as little as possible. It's the way I was raised I guess. <br><br>I don't see why a town player would say something about me that is blatantly false. <br><br>Like my stuff later in the game people can clearly make the argument that I'm being defensive (though correcting people who are saying false statements imo isn't being defensive. It's correcting their mistakes) but no way can anyone sit there and honestly say that I was defensive with regards to the whole morning conversation. <br><br>The person who deserved scrutiny in that exchange is mulch. It's normal behavior to say good morning in the morning. It's abnormal behavior to think somebody is strange for saying good morning in the morning. It's even worse to say it's \"weird as hell\" which is what he did. Now if it's not morning in your time zone, that's fine but it's still not weird and it certainly isn't \"weird as hell\""}

Mulch made a comment that didn't really make sense to me (and tbh I don't know it made sense to anyone else) and I responded back explaining and so in and so forth. <br><br>That by definition is a conversation between 2 people. There was no defensiveness nor overreacting. <br><br>If you don't like something somebody does don't just cast shade on it with a lame buzz word like it means something. It makes you sound more intelligent when you actually explain why you don't like something. Like what I did with mulch. <br><br>Explaining myself so my thought process isn't being defensive. Anyone who says it is, I don't trust them or their opinions. <br><br>People need to stop adding \"over\" to things also. A person is defensive and/or reactive. There is no such thing as being overly defensive or too defensive or over reacting and neither of those things are alignment indicative. <br><br><br>If you don't like how someone is acting say so and explain why using words. Much like I did when I explained why I didn't like mulch's posts.</div></blockquote><br><br>I'm not sure on what you are trying to say here in regards to what I've commented. I'm not, as far as I know, trying to throw buzzwords on things to make them mean something or to prove a point. Could you just point out the parts of my posts that you want me to elaborate on and I'll get right on it."}

But it is about weighing pros and cons against each other, which is what I'm doing in my last post. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9320360#p9320360\" class=\"postlink\">post 548</a>, Sergtacos wrote:</cite>Adding shuffle play to my scum read list</div></blockquote><br><br>Classic OMGUS, btw.

I explained why I'm putting you on my scums list. <br><br>To make it clear, you and klazam are both different cases. OFC if you are town you wouldn't know I'm town BUT if you are scum, well duh you know who's town. SO the pushing on a mislynch and saying \"his reads would tell us a lot of info about who he scum read and votes\" which concerns me because I know my votes and reads were eh and you could be using that to your advantage if everyone else agrees with you and sheeps my shitty reads."}

Obvious pro is if he is scum, we hit scum on D1. A lot of his posts have pinged me, especially the way he flip flops constantly (see above lol) I also like the read someone gave based on his previous game, saying that he did not sound the same. I'll verify that and read his existing meta when I get a second. <br><br>I understand that it could possibly be scum trying to push an easy mislynch maybe, but even if Serg is town, his flip would reveal a lot of information I feel like. Since he has been posting SO MUCH, it would be easy to go back after his flip and analyze his voting, who he was scumreading etc.<br><br>Also tbh I haven't properly caught up with the game since I last posted, I'll do that after work today, but just wanted to ask this Q first</div></blockquote><br>I know exactly what type of player serg is, and I also know that it's the easies mislynch in the world. Why are you and Carcalilly claiming we can get anything out of his reads afterwards if he's town? Scum are the only ones who know alignments for sure, so lynching scum shows us much, much more about the game than lynching town would. Sure he's posted a lot, but like 80% of it is joke posting. <br><br>I don't want to come off as having some kind of better opinion than anyone else, but I've lurked a long time on this site, and I've read through a metric ton of games. My main point here is that whenever there's one player who jokes around and posts more than any other player, basically doing exactly what serg is doing now, <span style=\"font-style: italic\">nearly every single game</span> that person is lynched and they flip town. I see a pattern, and I want to break it to win."}

But compared to the loss of other members of they were to flip town would be more detrimental in my opinion. So, comparitvley speaking, its not a con to me. <br>To play Mafia, people will be lynched. There should be no protecting or denying that. My first game, I was so focused on not lynching town that it totally screwed up the game. <br><br>OK, there's no use for me to respond to the forced accusation since I can't change your opinions anyway.

You try to seem town and it doesn't feel natural. then you made your huge \"case\" and dropped a vote and the entire thing seemed forced and the reasons haven't been very good. I don't like the way you are dancing around this taco pressure. It feels to me like you know he is going to flip town. I think the straw that broke the camel's back was when you said there would only be a con to lynching taco if he was some sort of PR. Losing any townie is a con. Losing an active member of the game is a HUGE con. Even if he does spam post a lot that doesn't mean he is detrimental to the game.</div></blockquote><br>I agree with all of this except for the thing about her saying there's only a con if taco is a pr, I can see someone saying that town or scum, even if I disagree with it.

I've seen scum post a lot, but the thing is that scum tend to post things that I don't really find a place for, or things that lead me to only one place. That's how lies work, they lead you to a single conclusion and that's it. That's why I'm townreading serg and carcalilly so much, and I know this sounds super vague but I can't be bothered to quote posts, I expect everybody who's going to reply to this to actually have read the game at an analysis level, but generally the way carcalilly and serg have been acting doesn't lead me to one place, it seems like actual content that makes me think about what's happening in the game. Tchill and empiricus don't come across that way, for the main point of this game they both seem to be been posting in ways that seem like they're trying to add to discussion without really doing so in a way I feel is towny and not goal focused in a scummy way. I don't necessarily think either of them are scum because of this, but the fact that I don't really see them as towny makes me feel uncomfortable. Twoface comes across as the type of player I'd want to lynch in a normal game, but I've read into his meta a little bit, and though I hate making decisions based on meta I've decided he's probably just being the way he is playing town. I don't like mulch either, he keeps mentioning he needs to read through stuff but not really seeming like he has, I dunno, seems like scum skirting. I don't mean any offense to him if that's not the case, but I feel like he's either not on top of the game so far as much as he would be normally, or he's just scum. Branson is probably scum, she plays a really focused analysis with a point to make and drops out, comes back in with a focus and drops again. I'm pretty convinced she's scum even if it's just day one.<br><br>There's a couple of things that really get to me when I play mafia, and one of them is memeposting or shitposting or having a joking attitude all of the time, whatever you want to call it, just because it makes people hard to read for me. I try (and fail, most of the time) to be really mechanical and methodical in the way that I approach things like this, because I want to be able to block a social game like this into something I can <span style=\"font-style: italic\">know</span> and understand in terms of game sense."}

Like, he has more analysis than anyone in this game thus far. I like how he brought up wanting to wait for the other people he hasn't interacted with to catch up. He says he's a newer player, but I wouldn't be able to tell from his play thus far. He's coming across as incredibly transparent town to me (if he's scum, he's doing that much better. Strongest town read I got.<br><br><span style=\"color: #00BF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">TwoFace</span></span></span> - lel. 2f is town. If he's not, I feel like I'll be able to sort him out later.<br><br><span style=\"color: #0040FF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Klazam</span></span></span> - OO. I actually like Klazam a lot, specifically with his interactions with TwoFace. I liked how he just didn't want to deal with Taco either. I feel like scumKla would go along with it more and potentially get a TvT read out of it. I'm going to lean town here. I understand how my reasons can be criticized with \"He could be scum doing all that.\", but I am town reading the slot. <br><br><span style=\"color: #0040FF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Sergtacos</span> </span></span>- So he's the most active this game, and definitely has the biggest presence. He has a lot of NAI posts, but there are some townie like posts in there. I feel like his posting comes from anxious town trying to figure the game out. He's trying out different things, and I don't think he has solidified his reads yet, it's day 1, they don't have to be, and I feel he's pretty genuine. I'm going to lean town here. It's just too early, and too many NAI posts to make me want to full on town read.<br><br><span style=\"color: #BF00FF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Trivium</span></span></span> - Initially I saw his 2F push as forced, but I understand why people push 2F. I thought I was going to end up scum reading him after reading through the rest, but I generally liked his other stuff. I liked his <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9328241#p9328241\" class=\"postlink\">761</a>. I'll null town here.<br><br><span style=\"color: #BF00FF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">shuffleplay</span></span></span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">(now Vedith)</span> - Eh, shuffle was solid. Not much, but she posted some bricks (not quite walls, but solid amount of content per post), and I feel like she was town trying to be active in the game. I'll null town. Vedith will be active, so I'm not worried about lack of content.<br><br><span style=\"color: #BF00FF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Fykus</span></span></span> - Fykus seems really genuine with the little amount of posts he has, but there's really not that much to go off of. I'll null town this slot for now. <br><br><span style=\"color: #80BFBF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Mulch</span></span></span> - Man...mulch could go either way. Like I'm 50/50. His carefree-okaywitheverythingexceptthethingshe'sexplicitlynot-yes man demeanor is hard for me to accept whatever read I pick off. I'll probably need a flip to sort this slot.<br><br><span style=\"color: #FF0080\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Carcalilly</span></span></span> - Okay, yeah. I definitely see why this slot is being scum read. I don't feel like stating more; 2f already did. I can't tell if I see her as scum or town feeling some pressure, and trying to get out of it without drawing more people to her. I'll null scum.<br><br><span style=\"color: #FF8000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Dunkerdoodles</span></span></span> - Most of the posts were on Taco, and I don't really like the 2F/Mulch scum read in addition to Taco. Not a whole lot to go off of, and if you're town, you're gonna have to show me, but I get big gut scum vibes from here. I'll lean scum.<br><br><span style=\"color: #FF0000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Empiricus</span> </span></span>- Okay, so you all are going to hate this as a reasoning, but his first post in the game screams scum to me. Like, screams. Like, my ex girlfriend just broke into my house at night, started shrieking, ate my pillow, punched my framed picture of ScarJo, and then stabbed me in the leg with a fork at 2:37 am. It just came off to me as \"Oh, hmm, I need to fabricate a post somewhere. This is an obvious joke! This is funny AND safe! I would say this even if I were town...yeah.\" Scum. This piled onto the fact he is pushing Serg/2F as scum seems like he's not scum hunting, and is just going for people he thinks a wagon could be built upon without him making a case. (he does kind of make cases, but meh. <br><br><span style=\"color: #FF0000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Branson</span></span></span> - He looks like he's fabricating the hell out his reads. Him pushing Carca looks fake as hell. Like, I agree that Carca seemed scummy, but I just get the feeling Branson saw that and ran with it, ya feel? When I'm scum, I can generally see when town is looking super scummy, and I feel that's what Branson did. I'm solidly scum reading this slot. His read list I felt that all his town reads were him trying to gain rapport and potentially turn into town leader and get them to follow him. If someone makes a case that isn't direct crap, i feel like he'd start pushing down a town read of his. This guy is going for a mislynch, and makes me kind of want to move Carca up a little. Scum.<br><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">()_+_) ()_-_) ()_+_) ()_-_) ()_+_) ()_-_) ()_+_) ()_-_) ()_+_) ()_-_) ()_+_) ()_-_) ()_+_) ()_-_) ()_+_) ()_-_) ()_+_) ()_-_) ()_+_) ()_-_) ()_+_) ()_-_) ()_+_) ()_-_)</span><br><br>Will Carcalilly turn out to be town feeling the pressure?<br><br>Will Branson make more fabricated scum reads?!?!<br><br>Will Taco ever stop spamming up the thread?!?!?!?!<br><br>Find out next time on....<span style=\"color: #800080\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;\">LAST NIGHT TOMORROW!</span></span></span></span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br></span><br>You want it...you need it...your stalker ex will hate it.

I'm just joking about him lurking. <br><br>So every time I make a post that contains something like lightheartedness and/or AtE I'm scum? What the..... People so need to know my playing style, but then that would be bad for me when I'm actual scum xD Ok, when I'm town I goof off. I'm care free because I have nothing to hide. When I'm scum, I try hard and more serious. <br>Empiricus and Klazam can confirm this. Well, I know Klazam can but idk about Emp tho. If klazam says no, he's lying omg. <br>Anyway, my votes stays on Klazam because he's scum. Please vote scum, unless you're scum too, which I think you might be scum. I'm thinking now you are defending him because he's your scum buddy. <br><br>Anyway, keep the game from moving forward? I'm bored, jesus. There's not enough people active to actually keep the game moving forward. <br><br>Ok Honestly, I'm not saying you could be scum because you're thinking I'm scum, I'm thinking you're scum because of trying to put Towny behavior. I feel like you're trying too hard to scum hunt, trying too hard to find scummies. Towns usually relax and think through and here you are asking almost everyone why they voted, etc etc. If you were to target someone else I would still question you anyway. <br><br>I even said I have no evidence. What kind of scum would say that? NADA, at least I think xD <br><br>I don't remember saying I'm against scum hunting, too lazy to look back as I am writing this. However, Scumhunting is fine, I'm just saying I will still lynch someone although that person is scumhunting due to experience. Like you for example, you're scum hunting, hats off to you, but are you really because you seem like you're doing it too hard. <br><br>But hey, my vote still stays on Klazam. He's scum, PERIOD. You scum buddy scummy scum you xD</div></blockquote><br><br>Thanks for the clarification. O_O Would've been nice earlier...<br><br>As I said, I'm totally chill with lightheartedness. I'm taking into account all the possibilities because why the heck not? It just stuck out to me because you're the most lighthearted player I've met so far (though I haven't played many games.)<br><br>Also, you're really concerning me with the \"no talking about the game irl or elsewhere\" rule. You didn't do anything right??? IT LOOKS LIKE YOU DID SOMETHING,, *sirens in the distance*<br><br>I agree there's not enough people, but why clog the thread with useless stuff?<br><br>I'm bored and wanna play some MAFIA.</div></blockquote><br><br>I'm bored:  gutreading this town"}

If someone makes a case that isn't direct crap, i feel like he'd start pushing down a town read of his. This guy is going for a mislynch, and makes me kind of want to move Carca up a little. Scum.</div></blockquote><br><br>Here's Boonskiie's entire case:<br><br>1. I'm faking my read on Carcalilly because I'm apparently seeing her as a really scummy town. Honestly, if it wasn't for that giant case a long time ago, which by the way was already like 90% of the reason I voted for her in the first place, I would've already hopped off of her and onto somebody else. I can accept everything else being weak points because really, they are. I used Carcalilly as a way to kick off my involvement in the game.<br><br>I'd point out the \"trying to become a town leader\" and \"pushing a town read if someone makes a decent case\", but I don't understand how I could both be trying to lead the town down whichever road I want them to go on, yet also be willing to sheep any good case onto anybody. It's complete nonsense.<br><br>The funniest part about this post is that he assumes I'd just sheep any good case I see, when I have both indicated that I don't actually sheep cases and haven't actually moved my vote off of Carcalilly ever since initially putting my vote onto her."}

Yeah you can turn that back around on me and say the same thing, but hes got 42 posts in the game already - surely you'd think there'd be some scum hunting interspersed in there. Another thing I noticed is his constant flip flop reads on taco. In the beginning of the game he reads taco as town blah blah blah but as the game goes on (and people started scum reading taco for all of his spam) he changes his reads to fit with everyone else - saying that taco is suddenly scum. Once the wagon on taco fell apart though you can see that he goes back to a strong town read on him again. <br><br>Another thing (probably NAI) is the lack of quoting. Like reading through the ISO is a pain in the ass because you don't know what hes responding to so to get a proper feel of it you have to re-read those sections of the game. Seems like this is a good strategy for scum to adopt, but maybe this is just his playstyle, can anyone vouch for that?<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: klazam</span><br><br>I'm confident to put my vote here for the moment."}

If we didn't have a scum flip or in this case 2 scum flips to compare it to, sure you could call it cherry picking but since we have actual scum flips it isn't really cherry picking anymore. <br><br>your interactions with the 2 flipped scum is by far the worst of the alive players. you discredited people who pushed them, you even went after people who were going after them, and to top it off you did very odd 180 on your carc read and never explained why you town read carc or why tchill was the wrong lynch.<br><br>if you are town, you are just going to have to take one for the team but right now you are the most obvious partner."}

I would actually rather lynch from lurkers, or someone like Branson, than lynch someone who I can't read very well. I guess that's a double edged sword, because the longer serg is here the more risk is involved, but I think sum have to show their face eventually. My point is, not everyone in the game has posted enough to make a solid read on them yet, so we should chill out on the guy who's going to pose a risk of lynching if scum jump on him.</div></blockquote><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9321451#p9321451\" class=\"postlink\">post 608</a>, Trivium wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9320320#p9320320\" class=\"postlink\">post 543</a>, shuffleplay wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9319857#p9319857\" class=\"postlink\">post 498</a>, Trivium wrote:</cite>And I know I've said this a few times already, but I dislike the taco votes and Dunker's vote seems of the opportune.</div></blockquote><br><br><br>@Trivium or anyone else really, could you explain to me the cons of lynching Sergtacos today? Obvious pro is if he is scum, we hit scum on D1. A lot of his posts have pinged me, especially the way he flip flops constantly (see above lol) I also like the read someone gave based on his previous game, saying that he did not sound the same. I'll verify that and read his existing meta when I get a second. <br><br>I understand that it could possibly be scum trying to push an easy mislynch maybe, but even if Serg is town, his flip would reveal a lot of information I feel like. Since he has been posting SO MUCH, it would be easy to go back after his flip and analyze his voting, who he was scumreading etc.<br><br>Also tbh I haven't properly caught up with the game since I last posted, I'll do that after work today, but just wanted to ask this Q first</div></blockquote><br>I know exactly what type of player serg is, and I also know that it's the easies mislynch in the world. Why are you and Carcalilly claiming we can get anything out of his reads afterwards if he's town? Scum are the only ones who know alignments for sure, so lynching scum shows us much, much more about the game than lynching town would. Sure he's posted a lot, but like 80% of it is joke posting. <br><br>I don't want to come off as having some kind of better opinion than anyone else, but I've lurked a long time on this site, and I've read through a metric ton of games. My main point here is that whenever there's one player who jokes around and posts more than any other player, basically doing exactly what serg is doing now, <span style=\"font-style: italic\">nearly every single game</span> that person is lynched and they flip town. I see a pattern, and I want to break it to win.</div></blockquote><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9330362#p9330362\" class=\"postlink\">post 814</a>, Trivium wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9329934#p9329934\" class=\"postlink\">post 810</a>, Tchill13 wrote:</cite>I'm a newer player I'm learning as I go but to call it a blatant lie playing according to my beliefs on the game I don't understand.
