Doing so will result in a mod-kill. Pretending to break this rule is the same as actually breaking it. You may paraphrase, but use caution. When in doubt, run it by me first.<br>\n 3] Do not edit any of your posts, if you have the ability to do so.<br>\n 4] Do not use encrypted text, hidden text, small text, or any other hard-to-read text when posting.. <br>\n 5] Once you have been lynched or killed, you are out of the game. Do not post anymore until the game is over. That means no \"Bah!\" posts, please.<br>\n 6] Do not talk about this game with anybody else outside of this thread unless your role PM explicitly says that you can.<br>\n <a name=\"7\">7</a>] Aspire to good sportsmanship. Please don't be a jerk to your fellow players. My subjective take on personal attacks is that on the internet, especially in games about lynching, shooting and stabbing where you have to put in considerable effort just to participate let alone deliver an astute performance, obnoxious and poorly argued discrediting of intellectual investment is way more detrimental to enjoyment than derogatory names, insults and flaming. Bearing anonymity in mind I wouldn't censor expression to shield impressionable people from taking vulgarity too personal. But I refrain from imposing my way of seeing it. Heated discussion is fine, but vehement personal attacks, insults and flaming are not. If I feel that your behavior is preventing other players from enjoying the game, I reserve the right to force-replace or mod-kill you.<br>\n 8] Do not talk about ongoing games. Easy peasy.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display: inline; color:#000000 !important; background:#000000 !important; padding:0px 3px;\" title=\"This text is hidden to prevent spoilers; to reveal, highlight it with your cursor.\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FFFFBF\">Day, Night, and Twilight:</div></div></div><br>\n 9] <div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF8000\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Each Day phase will last for 8 days apiece</div></div></div> and each Night phase will last for two days. I will post specific deadlines in the game thread at the start of every Day and Night phase.<br>\n10] Players may continue to talk during Twilight, including the player that has been lynched.<br>\n11] If you do not send me your Night action before the specified deadline, I will assume that you are not performing an action on that Night. <br>\n12] If you know you will be unavailable during a Night phase, you may send me your night action during the preceding Day phase if you so desire.<br>\n13] Deadline extension requests will be considered on a case-by-case basis.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display: inline; color:#000000 !important; background:#000000 !important; padding:0px 3px;\" title=\"This text is hidden to prevent spoilers; to reveal, highlight it with your cursor.\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FFFFBF\">Voting:</div></div></div><br>\n14] Please post all votes and unvotes using either the bold tag or the vote tag. Nicknames are fine, as long as I can understand them. Votes should look like this: <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote:NakedJogger</div> or <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: NJ</span><br>\n15] Unvotes are helpful, but not necessary.<br>\n16] Please refrain from engaging in any kind of voting trickery. If it looks like a vote, I'm counting it as a vote.<br>\n17] A lynch will only occur when a majority (more than 50% of all possible votes) is reached. The number of votes needed to hammer will be included with every vote count.<br>\n18] If a majority is not reached by the deadline, there will be no lynch on that Day.<br>\n19] Once a hammer occurs, no votes or unvotes will prevent the lynch from happening.<br>\n20] You may VOTE: No Lynch to end the Day with no lynch (which will also require a majority). You may VOTE: Draw to end the game in a draw (which will require 100% agreement from all living players) if you wish to insult me.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display: inline; color:#000000 !important; background:#000000 !important; padding:0px 3px;\" title=\"This text is hidden to prevent spoilers; to reveal, highlight it with your cursor.\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FFFFBF\">Activity:</div></div></div><br>\n21] You will be expected to post at least once every 48 hours. If you go more than 48 hours without posting, you will be prodded.<br>\n22] If you receive a prod, you will have 24 hours to post in the game thread. If you do not respond to your prod within 24 hours, you will be replaced. Additionally, if I have to prod you more than <div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF8000\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">two</div></div></div> times, you will be replaced.<br>\n23] If you know that you will have limited access to the game for more than a few days, please let me know either in the thread or via PM.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display: inline; color:#000000 !important; background:#000000 !important; padding:0px 3px;\" title=\"This text is hidden to prevent spoilers; to reveal, highlight it with your cursor.\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FFFFBF\">Communication with the Moderator:</div></div></div><br>\n24] I am perfect and the \"mistakes\" I make are my way of empathizing with stupidity. Nevertheless I will correct any errors you might notice regarding vote counts, deadlines, or anything else related to the game.  <br>\n25] I will not answer any role-related questions in the game thread. If you have any questions about your role, the (theoretical) roles of any other players in the game, or (theoretical) role interactions, send me a PM. Do not try to trick me into confirming a player's role. I will not be amused.<br>\n26] If you need to get my attention, just include @Mod in your post. Also, bolding will help catch my eye.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display: inline; color:#000000 !important; background:#000000 !important; padding:0px 3px;\" title=\"This text is hidden to prevent spoilers; to reveal, highlight it with your cursor.\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FFFFBF\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Miscellaneous:</div></div></div><br>\n27] If you have any problems with another player, send me a PM and I will do my best to resolve the issue. If you like me take my personal views in <a href=\"#7\">the seventh rule</a> to heart. <br>\n28] If a player is mod-killed during the Day phase, then that Day will end immediately.<br>\n29] <div style=\"display: inline; color:#000000 !important; background:#000000 !important; padding:0px 3px;\" title=\"This text is hidden to prevent spoilers; to reveal, highlight it with your cursor.\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FFFFBF\">Don't post like this!</div></div></div><br>\n30] The flavor text is for entertainment purposes only. Analyze it at your own risk.<br>\n31] Do not ask me to mod-kill, force-replace, or discipline any other player in the game. That is my decision to make, not yours.<br>\n32] As the moderator, my word is final. Please respect my instructions and my decisions.<br>\n33] I reserve the right to change these rules during the game if necessary. If this happens, I will inform everybody of the rule change in the thread.<br>\n34] In addition to these rules, all site-wide rules also apply.<br>\n35] Claiming color code is prohibited. <br>\n36] I live in Romania, but the deadlines will be convenient for US Americans: 5 PM California, 8 PM New York, 00:00 UTC.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\"><div style=\"font-size: 120%; line-height: normal; display: inline\"><div style=\"display: inline; color:#000000 !important; background:#000000 !important; padding:0px 3px;\" title=\"This text is hidden to prevent spoilers; to reveal, highlight it with your cursor.\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FFFFBF\">Sample Role PM</div></div></div></div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">At least one person  received this PM</div></div><br>\n<fieldset style=\"border:3px outset grey;padding:5px 10px\">Aloha!<br>\n<br>\nYou are a <div style=\"display:inline;color:#80BF00\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vanilla Townie</div></div>.

We are devoted to the Hydra God and the awesome blossoming the intelligent synergy of its heads provide: godlogic, astute observation, discipline, skill, empathy, curiosity, style, effort, relevance and aesthetics. Heretics will be frowned upon. 3. Don't tell anyone to fuck off out of the game no matter how much they lurk. 4. Naked-claiming town makes you look like a clown. 5. Meta is a lubricant, nothing more nothing less. 6. Votes are luciferous if used in tune with a sense of what is constructively interesting, providing flash means of communicating what would stall and diminish momentum and unleash hell if attempted to be expressed otherwise or absent. Hollow chime wastes everyone's time and soul. 7. Enlightened objectivity is Mazda while immature subjectivity is Pi&#269;a. Noble Mazda may undauntedly bitchslap tawdry Pi&#269;a to assert its hierarchical dominance. Common-senselessly turning the table on this wisdom results in exile from divine love.

There's nothing wrong with sheeping an argument or vote you agree with and can provide valid reasoning as to why you're sheeping. I don't see how where I placed my RVS vote has any relevance as to where my \"real\" vote is. Can you give me a reason why scum is more likely to keep their vote on their RVS than town?<br>\n<br>\nI'm not going to meta grib because I don't really need to. I'll take his word that he often puts out early reads. It's not relevant to the point, which is that grib basically fabricated weak reads out of nowhere that he pushed as legit and said with what seemed like confidence. I don't care if he usually does this, because if he's usually acting scummy as both alignments then he should be a policy lynch. If he's only doing it as town, that's a meta read which can be manipulated, and it holds no weight imo.<br>\n<br>\nIf you see people who I should be pushing, great, tell me. Just say \"Why aren't you pushing so and so for so and so?\" And I'll be happy to answer. If your point's valid, I'll push them, and if I really think you've found a good scumtell or scummy action I'll vote them. I provided reasons because that's what you do every time you make a read or vote unless you're reaction testing. It helps other people understand why you're doing what you're doing, which is beneficial for everyone. I provided a full reads list because of acombination of my own decision and Atum's prompting. <br>\n<br>\nWhat should I do to \"further solidify\" my grib read? I have an idea, I'll wait until he posts some more and then evaluate those posts. If he doesn't post, I'll be more inclined to lynch him. I'm not set in stone on calling him scum.<br>\n<br>\nCan't tell if the \"why\" at the end is a legitamate question or a petty jab at me (in which case it would be pretty ironic, because you've said I make no attempt to solidify my reads, and asking questions is a pretty good way to do that)", "time": "Sat Aug 15, 2015 2:17 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=62993&start=150", "forum": "53", "thread": "62993"}

It's a limited shot, so any night he doesn't die he can claim either that he got town, or that he just hasn't used it yet.

Also like that he's asking more experienced players if something he observed is a tell or not, strikes me as a very genuine gesture where he's looking for advice on his reads, would be a surprising sentiment to fake there as scum. Response to elusive in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7148189#p7148189\" class=\"postlink\">#167</a> also reads as a very honest, particularly the sentiment of \"If you see people who I should be pushing, great, tell me\" - reads as someone who really wants to find scum in this case.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Bellaphant</div> - null/town, I hate to say I like something as vague as the overall tone of her posts, but that's what strikes me, her case on scorp in #190 was solid, #117 seemed to be some solid questioning, but she's tailed off lately.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Maxous</div> - null/town, like that he seems to be actively scumhunting and posting reads, some of his reads are hard to understand though, in fact he names 3 people as town or townish who are all in my scum reads.

Still don't like the fact that she sat on her RVS vote before voting me though, and she ultimately doesn't have a lot of substance to her posts - she's named reads but not really explained most of them, would like to see a bit more elaboration.

Very little actual content to go by.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Grib/shaddowez</div> - null/scum - still don't like that grib essentially never followed up a reads list that was extremely forced coming on page 2, everything he posted after was more or less filler. As for shaddowez, a lot of their reads have just been saying someone looks good or bad without saying why, and they accuse superbowl of repeating someone else's argument, but a lot of their case on scorp is sutff that other people have posted in the topic. Still, they seem to be making something of a legitimate effort and my read on the slot isn't as harsh as it was initially. The point on gray is a nice catch, actually - gray's really said nothing of value recently and doesn't appear to have a followup to his unvote.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Banakai</div> - null/scum. Also very light on content, seems mostly to comment on the main subjects of discussion, <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7144540#p7144540\" class=\"postlink\">#115</a> is very wishy-washy, says my claim's suspicious but comes up with reasons I'm likely to be real, all while sheeping my vote on Grib, then in his very next post goes to vote scorpious over me. Still can see some hint of a legitimate effort in his posts, might get easier to read with a little more content.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Grayfoxxxx</div> - null/scum - Don't like the fact he promised reads in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7148546#p7148546\" class=\"postlink\">#170</a> then never delivered. He complained about not having much to go on early on, but hasn't really developed opinions since then, his one real move was to sheep the vote on scorp but now doesn't want to vote either of us, but hasn't presented an alternative.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Radja</div> - null/scum. essentially very little signs of scumhunting. As far as I can tell, hasn't voiced a stronger suspicion than voting banakai early on for speculating about the existence of a cop role. Throws weak suspicion at scorpious in #111 and #200, then at malakittens in #202, but never makes an outright accusation. A post like <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7145604#p7145604\" class=\"postlink\">#130</a> isn't bothersome in and of itself, but it's all basically safe, neutral statements that appear active but don't really advance anything. Somehow strikes me as worse than other low content posters because he seems to be trying to <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">appear</div> active, while saying very little, and I don't get a real sense of purpose to the posts.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Scum</div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Lalendra</div> - Spends a lot of time talking about my claim, calls it suspicious in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7142039#p7142039\" class=\"postlink\">#81</a>, seems to express doubt over the strategy of claiming right away in #106/#107, but in #120 says she tends to believe my claim, after general sentiment seems to be going toward not lynching me. Then, posts after that - #224 asks a question of superbowl9, no real followup, dismissive of another read, talking about my claim again. <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7150695#p7150695\" class=\"postlink\">#227</a> is just weak suspicion of scorp, reluctance to vote due to the role, but then votes him anyway in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7153696#p7153696\" class=\"postlink\">#286</a> on a day-old post she'd already read/quoted past.

Don't like at all that her response to being attacked for lack of content is to claim there's nothing else to say and everyone else is just as bad (to be fair i've a lot of null/scum reads, but that doesn't make it any more of a good way to respond)<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">elusive</div> -  Wanted to say town when I went into my iso reads, but came away with a far worse impression than my initial one. Can understand why they'd be doubtful of my claim given lack of experience with the meta but the fact is I've never seen a miller that didn't claim day 1 and not doing so seems stupid to me. Vote in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7144605#p7144605\" class=\"postlink\">#116</a> came across as town annoyance, getting fed up with someone not contributing. However, a lot of their posts after that come off as looking to attack others, more than scumhunting - #150, #157, #159, #179, are examples of this, as well as #191 - they're short posts that really just kind of pick at people without going so far as to make a full blown case.<br>\n<br>\nThe lack of a read on Grib is troubling, especially given they seem to have some familiarity with him and seemingly attacked people for voting him (see <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7147591#p7147591\" class=\"postlink\">#165</a>) The implicit critique here is that they think this is just grib's meta, but they don't say it outright and the only plausible motivation I can see is not wanting to defend him outright.<br>\n<br>\nAlso very notable that in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7147200#p7147200\" class=\"postlink\">#150</a> elusive calls out a post by scorpious as \"super scummy\" but a single day later in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7149798#p7149798\" class=\"postlink\">#191</a> They say he's \"a little iffy\" but try to redirect attention away from scorpious and toward gray - they go from saying his actions are \"super scummy\" to soft defending him in a day's time, a dramatic shift in reads that I really don't see much of a rational explanation for. Strongly think this is scum.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Scorpious</div> - yeah, still. overall style of posting has been very much to cast soft suspicion on people rather than making strong accusations, justification of not trusting my miller claim seems incredibly poor - miller's not a remotely uncommon role, and the idea that it's a good role for scum to claim is idiotic, essentially prevents them from claiming anything stronger and runs a risk of a counter claim or being outed by an investigative role. The overall questioning doesn't seem to have a purpose or go anywhere, also frequently pressing other players for content while saying little himself. The fact that he unvoted me when I mentioned his vote hadn't moved from RVS, then immediately re-voted just doesn't make sense from any sort of town mindset.<br>\n<br>\nVote on shaddowez is terrible, too. His mentions of Grib go from asking two randos if they support the lynch on Grib (#110), then never following up on it, asking him if he has reads that don't reference meta (#139), says that about him, which is basically meaningless commentary, along with saying his reaction to my claim is suspect, while trying to push him on my claim (#203), and then says he'd lynch the slot because...his reads were based on meta (as if that's meaningful) (#272). And that's \"wary of the slot from the beginning\"? He'd only begun to express real suspicion of Grib 12 hours ago once it was clear to him I wasn't getting lynched. This just smacks of dishonesty.<br>\n<br>\nFeel strongly on elu-scum but absolutely think Scorpious should be the vote today.<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Scorpious</span><br>\n<br>\ni also really regret how much my claim seems to have monopolized discussion on a reread but i don't know how i'd have played it differently<br>\n<br>\nalso if any of this reads badly i'm sorry it's late and i spent hours typing this and i flip flopped a couple of times so i didn't spend much tiem editing anyway i need to sleep", "time": "Mon Aug 17, 2015 7:25 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=62993&start=300", "forum": "53", "thread": "62993"}

However, a lot of their posts after that come off as looking to attack others, more than scumhunting - #150, #157, #159, #179, are examples of this, as well as #191 - <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">they're short posts that really just kind of pick at people without going so far as to make a full blown case.</div></div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">The lack of a read on Grib is troubling, especially given they seem to have some familiarity with him and seemingly attacked people for voting him (see <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7147591#p7147591\" class=\"postlink\">#165</a>) The implicit critique here is that they think this is just grib's meta, but they don't say it outright and the only plausible motivation I can see is not wanting to defend him outright.</div></div><br>\n<br>\nAlso very notable that in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7147200#p7147200\" class=\"postlink\">#150</a> elusive calls out a post by scorpious as \"super scummy\" <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">but a single day later</div></div> in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7149798#p7149798\" class=\"postlink\">#191</a> They say he's \"a little iffy\" but try to redirect attention away from scorpious and toward gray - they go from saying his actions are \"super scummy\" to soft defending him in a day's time, <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">a dramatic shift in reads that I really don't see much of a rational explanation for</div></div>.

What cases for scum has anyone else in the thread made? Point me to a strong case that someone made where you are following them. <br>\n2. Link me to a day one game where you accurately read players as town\\scum and made full blown cases that were accurate. Kind of want to see where you're at with that.<br>\n3. Scorpious has alleged he is a newbie (could be an alt, idk, I don't give out freebies to newbies - go to newbie school if your expecting hand holding), he also within that time period made a claim to be a doc. Why don't you believe his claim but expect yours to be believed?<br>\n4. Why are you voting for someone other than me if you think I'm strongly scum? Why? Why? Why? Why?

The overall questioning doesn't seem to have a purpose or go anywhere, also frequently pressing other players for content while saying little himself. The fact that he unvoted me when I mentioned his vote hadn't moved from RVS, then immediately re-voted just doesn't make sense from any sort of town mindset.<br>\n<br>\nVote on shaddowez is terrible, too. His mentions of Grib go from asking two randos if they support the lynch on Grib (#110), then never following up on it, asking him if he has reads that don't reference meta (#139), says that about him, which is basically meaningless commentary, along with saying his reaction to my claim is suspect, while trying to push him on my claim (#203), and then says he'd lynch the slot because...his reads were based on meta (as if that's meaningful) (#272). And that's \"wary of the slot from the beginning\"? <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">He'd only begun to express real suspicion of Grib 12 hours ag</div></div>o once it was clear to him I wasn't getting lynched. This just smacks of dishonesty.<br>\n<br>\nFeel strongly on elu-scum but absolutely think Scorpious should be the vote today.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: normal; display: inline\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#800080\"><br>\n1. Actually I've played upwards of idk how many games on MS and this is my first encounter with a miller. So Miller isn't that common, maybe in this queue but not on the site.<br>\n2. So with that in mind and the alleged noob and my own feeling that claiming miller as the Wiki says may not be the best strategy (why not crumb it and then claim when needed?) Etc. You have actually ignored everyone talking about why it isn't the best to claim. The Wiki wasn't written by God nor does the Wiki have stats on how effective it is to claim Miller day one, for all we know wo research its possibly the worst thing ever. <br>\n3. I also pointed that out.<br>\n4. Is casting suspicion on players scummy? Why?  What would town do or what would scum do? How is that different from your potentially 7 scum\\nullscum?</div></div></div><br>\n</div></blockquote>", "time": "Tue Aug 18, 2015 5:52 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=62993&start=300", "forum": "53", "thread": "62993"}

He founded the Altruist Bats Club social network. <br>\n<br>\nWhen he was 5 years old Bat taught himself echolocation during a power outage by smacking his tongue against the roof of his mouth, thereby producing a clicking sound and listening for the variation of its echo. He kept exercising it, alienating himself from his schoolmates, some of which sometimes bullied him by rhythmically tapping his protruded ears with their fingers in rapid succession. <br>\n<br>\nWhen NJ joined his class Bat ceased to be the fastest runner, the only respect-earning atu he had, but NJ envied him for being able to run at full speed with his eyes closed and they quickly became friends until NJ claimed to have kissed the angel-faced girl Bat was stalking, desperately trying to win affection from, even thinking about offering himself to become her slave, and told him she was nothing special. <br>\n<br>\nWitnessing the advent of smartphones Bat realized that the time had come for him to learn coding, but it was tedious and he couldn't do it without help. Eventually he managed to code an app for playing voice forum mafia he called Subaru VFM, an homage to the pleiades in an attempt to get the car company he liked so much to sponsor it but wound up re-branding it Woof instead.<br>\n<br>\nA smarter marketing strategy that did pay off was to encourage the production of satirical voice-commercial sketches &#224; la GTA Radio but community-made, that mimicked real adds until those started accumulating. Once paid adds were abundant he set the probability of a sketch to appear on a player's virtual answering machine to 33%. <br>\n<br>\nWoof VFM featured among other functionalities a compact 3d representation of the index of posts, rendering it clearly discernible which input was a response to which segment of the other, in a practical and visually attractive (reminiscent of star constellations) design. Bat saw its potential outside the game and launched a sister app called Ether and successfully lured forumites from reddit, 4chan etc. in part because they liked how easy it was to use soundboards instead of smileys, a cappella and jam to each other's audioposts and use effects like movie-trailer voice or spooky reverse-reverb, which were unlockable in Woof only through achievements while playing ranked games (3 games played at the same time with identical open setup and the same players out of which only an uninformed couple would be faced-off and ranked). His 3rd app was the prototype for ABC and caught the attention of the council. <br>\n<br>\nA hidden functionality which very few people knew about, inherent in all of Bat's apps was the abuse of the mobile device running it as a sonar, emitting ultrasound frequencies, subsequently capturing and sending them to a hub to which only Bat had access. <br>\n<br>\nIt was nearly impossible for him to remain sufficiently focused to evaluate the complex data by ear while in a waking state, so he began working on a program that could do it for him but he reached the end of his funds and wherewithal. Until winning Womb Mafia games or accumulating Karma otherwise, he had to continue doing it while lucid-dreaming. <br>\n<br>\nIn his most demiurgic one's he solidified the blueprint for a prototype recon drone he called 'Robat', in his most unsettling one he witnessed <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqk2raqOhfE\" class=\"postlink\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">NJ</div></a> die.<br>\nNJ's phone's heart frequency monitor picked up his cardiac arrest and sent a set of texts to the council members and instructions for a forum mafia game to the Commodore.

In this game he's still defensive, prickly but not as aggressive in pointing at scum.  Is that scummy?

The push on to gray is bad, too - really their case on him had amounted to \"his ISO is bad\" due mainly to low content posting but it's never really justified beyond that. Just a weak push that involves calling attention to things and hoping others see it as scummy rather than assembling any real points as to why there's actually anything wrong with gray's posting.

I feel like I've explained myself several times but you avoid saying anything of substance.<br>\n<br>\nAnd to talk of moving the goalposts, you point back at your interactions with scorp, don't actually cite anything and when I say there's nothing there, you tell me to go research your meta.

I don't think Scorpy would've pushed any of his buddies that hard: so we look at who else he's got a stream of negative interactions with: you, catboi, atum. Catboi has claimed town, so that makes me think that maybe you and Atum are also town - which is interesting, because like mala I was concerned about you.<br>\n<br>\nWhat is also interesting is the people Scorp basically ignores: super and radja are only mentioned in passing once. I dunno if this was distancing.<br>\n<br>\nHowever, catboi said scorp ignored elu: this is incorrect, as she was the third most interacted slot from scorp.

In a vacuum what mala did might be suspicious but most people are reluctant to lynch a claimed PR so to me it's not really a tell. Still there's at least a sense of her looking for something to latch on to, not going with the flow. Not sure why I found her all that suspicious on day 1. Still need to see more before I'd be comfortable declaring her town.<br>\n<br>\nbellaphant - ultra lurky, frankly not a lot to go by here. Not a lot of analysis, mostly talks about popular targets.

The lack of tangible reads beyond that bothers me quite a bit.

Don't like that sort of thing because he's just taking potshots without really explaining. Of course never follows up. His vote on malakittens stinks, there's seemingly little to no concern with doing anything productive. So far as I can tell, is voting malakittens because she said gray was a vig kill? Terrible vote (it obviously was a vig) and he's done basically nothing with it. Does make me pause that he was the first to call out Scorp in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7145469#p7145469\">127</a>, though the way he did it was awkward.
