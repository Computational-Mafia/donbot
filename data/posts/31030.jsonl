The sun was shining, the birds were singing, and everything was right in the world. Everyone, all twelve people, were out in the park enjoying the nice weather. The day just couldn&#8217;t get better, when...<br>\n<br>\n<fieldset style=\"border:3px outset grey;padding:5px 10px\">&#8220;Someone&#8217;s been murdered!&#8221;<br>\n<br>\nEveryone rushed over to see what&#8217;s happened. Laying on a bench, in the middle of the park, was John Smith, with a bullet wound in his chest.<br>\n<br>\nGroup hysteria set in immediately.<br>\n<br>\n&#8220;Who could&#8217;ve done this?&#8221;<br>\n<br>\n&#8220;I think I&#8217;m going to be sick!&#8221;<br>\n<br>\n&#8220;Murderville is such a good neighborhood! How could this happen?&#8221;</fieldset><br>\n<br>\nThe population was down by eight percent that day, and the tension in the town was at an all time high. Perhaps they should&#8217;ve had a police force. Never the less, some sweet, sweet, justice was about to go down. The town set up the old hangin&#8217; tree (it was a darker time), and put up some rope. It&#8217;s time for Murderville (Population 11) to put matters into their own hands.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: Living Players (Asterisks indicate prods):</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = '';

Site-wide rules apply.<br>\n2. In all interactions with the moderator, you must be honest.<br>\n3. Don&#8217;t do anything that would be considered cheating.<br>\n4. Don&#8217;t quote your role PM, take a screenshot of it, etc. You may only paraphrase it.<br>\n5. Do not attempt to use a system of robust cryptography, etc. Do not use small or invisible text to attempt to avoid detection.<br>\n6. If you go 72 hours without a post, I&#8217;ll send you an official prod. If you go 48 hours without a post, a player may request an unofficial prod on you. If you get three official prods, I&#8217;ll replace you. If you don&#8217;t respond to a prod after 48 hours, I&#8217;ll replace you.<br>\n7. Try to keep the activity level up so the game doesn&#8217;t stall out.<br>\n8. If you know you&#8217;re going to be absent a period of time, please tell me ahead of time.<br>\n9. Each player gets a single vote to use during the day that they may change as many times as they wish to vote for any player.<br>\n10. When a majority of players are voting for a certain player, that player is \"lynched\" and removed from the game.<br>\n11. Players may vote for \"No Lynch.\" If at least half of the players vote for a \"No Lynch,\" the day ends without a lynch.<br>\n12. Game days will last up to three weeks. If a vote hasn&#8217;t been decided in that time, a &#8220;No Lynch&#8221; will occur.<br>\n13. Don&#8217;t discuss this game elsewhere, and don&#8217;t discuss other ongoing games in here.<br>\n14. I may not have covered everything. If something comes up, I will handle it at my discretion.<br>\n15. Feel free to PM me if you have any concerns.<br>\n16. Days will last two weeks, and nights will last three days. If a day meets the deadline and a lynch hasn't occurred, you lose that day's lynch.<br>\n17.

However, there are a few odd things I find about his posts. First of all, he's never moved off of his RVS vote. In post #78 he asks Lord Mhork to explain his RVS vote that he has kept so far, when he himself is also still on an unexplained RVS vote. Posts #129 and #137 seem to contradict himself. First he wonders if the reason \"I'm trying to act too \"pro-town\" is the only case against me, then he proceeds to tell me that \"trying to act pro-town\" is the reason I'm in trouble. TL;DR: I have a gut town read, but I don't like his back and forth reluctance to hop on my wagon.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Lord Mhork</div> - Leaning Scum - Post #17, he says he's reluctant to let the self vote go. Next time he brings it up, in post #96, he let's the self vote go to jump on so other vulnerable targets. Strangely enough, he keeps his vote on NS, even though he's dismissed the self vote to hydra dissonace and not being alignment indicative. Then, in post #101, he says he is voting notSakura because of the self vote. This makes no sense since Mhork has already dismissed the self vote and is a weak excuse to continue having his vote on NS when he attacked me heavily in post #96. Mhork contradicting himself, and backtracking certainly doesn't look good for town does it? In post #109 he votes me, what happened to that self vote he backtracked on and said he was voting NS for? Why vote me now? I also don't like his post #149. There are definitely plenty of times where claiming is good and can help town.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">fuzzybutternut</div> - Null Leaning Scum - Post #55 is just plain scummy. The entire time this game Fuzzy has been far too eager to jump on others cases and redirect attention away from himself. Post #110 is so fucking scummy. No this is not OMGUS, this really is scummy. Look at that post, do you see how easily he hops on my bandwagon, he is very very eager to direct attention away from him and hops on my wagon for little to no reason. Post #112, apparently I can't ask for people to have actual reasons for voting me. Fuzzy just hops on my wagon and deflects my question on why he hopped on for no reason. Post #120... Again deflects my question. \"There only BS reasons to you buddy.\" Fuzzy's reason (if you can call it that) was BS, he provided little to no reason to join my wagon and tried to do so as quietly as possible, when I called him out on it he redirects attention on to me.<br>\n<br>\nI strongly suspect that both Lord Mhork and Fuzzy are scum.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Porkens</div> - Null - I tried not to include null reads in the post, but there are a few things that are a bit odd about Porkens, can't decide whether they are scummy or not though. First of all, Porkens has been fence sitting this entire game. He stuck with his RVS vote and is afraid to vote anyone else, he says he doesn't know where else to vote, but I find that hard to believe with the two main wagons being myself and Fuzzy. Perhaps Porkens is town who just doesn't have an opinion, or maybe scum not trying to anger anyway. I encourage Porkens to actually vote someone, or keep your vote on Ztife, but only for good reasons. You need to formulate opinions, fence sitting the entire game will not help town.<br>\n<br>\nAnyone else I didn't mention I either don't have a read on, is null, or there just isn't enough to go off of.<br>\n<br>\nPlease reread my Lord Mhork section and hop on on his wagon. He is by far the scummiest player.<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: Fuzzy</span><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Lord Mhork</span>", "time": "Mon Aug 26, 2013 9:59 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=31030&start=150", "forum": "53", "thread": "31030"}

And if you read my previous posts, when I realised town could settle for a not dann lynch that's what I voted for. I said I could see him being scum but I wouldn't even flinch if he flipped town. As I said all the time since my maybe third post or what it was, I can settle with Mhork, Fuzzy and Dann and wanted Fuzzy the most when I saw Fuzzy being a possibility what did I do? I don't know where you're at. oh and ok, I didn't know town couldn't defend themselves, I am sorry.  <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":neutral:\" title=\"Neutral\">", "time": "Thu Sep 05, 2013 7:39 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=31030&start=400", "forum": "53", "thread": "31030"}

The player who actively ignores me when I've made a good point is absolutely scum. You voted me because I *somehow* knew DP was expecting a reaction, and deliberately hid mine. What you've failed to show is the evidence to suggest that I actually knew I was being tested. If your vote is genuine then surely you must have seen something, ANYTHING related to deliberate reaction-hiding. As it stands, it honestly feels like you tried to pull a reason out of the thin fucking air as an excuse to vote me.<br>\n<br>\nHow about it? Gonna explain your vote on me or are you much more comfortable <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5316413#p5316413\" class=\"postlink\">shifting attention towards elle and ztife</a>? I can guarantee I won't shut up about this unless you nightkill me so it's probably in your best interest to stop ignoring me.

The only reason at the moment that he's questionable for me is still the whole Ztife thing that I explain in 495. It pings me - and I don't like it - and while it would ping me harder if Ztife were to flip town, idk that it would alter my other read enough to put him as a contender to ns' scumbud, DP. (But I want this out there before the end of day hits.) And if Ztife flips scum, Mhork is obvtown, almost conftown... and srs props for calling that with four posts.", "time": "Tue Sep 17, 2013 10:23 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=31030&start=525", "forum": "53", "thread": "31030"}

I find it tough to believe scum would be trying to get a compromise vote on their buddy.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">BACK TO THE COUNT</div><br>\nFuzzynut- 2<br>\nMhork- 2<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">SEGWAY 2.0</div><br>\nThe second post in which Shadi mentions Mhork <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5271300#p5271300\">272</a> is in response to a shadi scumread on Mhork where mhork had questioned it, it almost looked like scum asking his buddy what went wrong.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">BACK TO THE COUNT</div><br>\nPorkens- 3 (mostly him bitching about Porkens not reading his answers to questions)<br>\nKJ- 3<br>\n<br>\nSo as I was reading his ISO, some things jumped out at me. He seems to be buddying KJ pretty hard. He's had Dann Fuzzy and Mhork as his primary scumread trio, and I'll bet ANYTHING there is one scum in that grouping. It can't be Dann, so therefore it is between fuzzynut and Mhork. I'm leaning towards Mhork personally. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5273687#p5273687\">320</a> Looks VERY bad for Mhork. I'm moving Elle to town because I just realized something. Mhork was Shadi's scumread yet Shadi was perfectly content in following Mhork while making statements such as that. It looks like him playing safe and using mhork as a fallboy. Porkens is probably town based on Shadi's ISO. His only response to Ztife looks very distancy. However, I'm not sure DP isn't his scumbuddy anymore. So, one scum between Mhork and Fuzzy and one between DP and Ztife. <br>\n<br>\nBecause I know it'll be asked, my reads all shifted after reading through his ISO.
