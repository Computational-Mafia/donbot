Site-wide rules apply.<br>2. In all interactions with the moderator, you must be honest.<br>3. Don\u2019t do anything that would be considered cheating.<br>4. Don\u2019t quote your role PM, take a screenshot of it, etc. You may only paraphrase it.<br>5. Do not attempt to use a system of robust cryptography, etc. Do not use small or invisible text to attempt to avoid detection.<br>6. If you go 72 hours without a post, I\u2019ll send you an official prod. If you go 48 hours without a post, a player may request an unofficial prod on you. If you get three official prods, I\u2019ll replace you. If you don\u2019t respond to a prod after 48 hours, I\u2019ll replace you.<br>7. Try to keep the activity level up so the game doesn\u2019t stall out.<br>8. If you know you\u2019re going to be absent a period of time, please tell me ahead of time.<br>9. Each player gets a single vote to use during the day that they may change as many times as they wish to vote for any player.<br>10. When a majority of players are voting for a certain player, that player is \"lynched\" and removed from the game.<br>11. Players may vote for \"No Lynch.\" If at least half of the players vote for a \"No Lynch,\" the day ends without a lynch.<br>12. Game days will last up to three weeks. If a vote hasn\u2019t been decided in that time, a \u201cNo Lynch\u201d will occur.<br>13. Don\u2019t discuss this game elsewhere, and don\u2019t discuss other ongoing games in here.<br>14. I may not have covered everything. If something comes up, I will handle it at my discretion.<br>15. Feel free to PM me if you have any concerns.<br>16. Days will last two weeks, and nights will last three days. If a day meets the deadline and a lynch hasn't occurred, you lose that day's lynch.<br>17. To prevent meta gaming, if a killing role doesn't submit their kill, I'll randomize it.<br>18. I have final say.<br><br>Sample VT Role PM:</span></span><br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>You are a <span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #00FF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Vanilla Townie.</span></span></span><br>During the day you may use your vote to find the scum.<br><br>You are aligned with the town. You win if all threats to the town are eliminated and at least one town-aligned player is alive. Please confirm by sending me a PM with your role name and alignment. The game thread is <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=31030\" class=\"postlink\">here.</a></div></blockquote>"}

If we are out of RVS than you should have some at least somewhat scummy reads, instead of sticking to your RVS vote, why don't ya vote the person you think is scummiest? If you think NS is scummiest then why?"}

However, there are a few odd things I find about his posts. First of all, he's never moved off of his RVS vote. In post #78 he asks Lord Mhork to explain his RVS vote that he has kept so far, when he himself is also still on an unexplained RVS vote. Posts #129 and #137 seem to contradict himself. First he wonders if the reason \"I'm trying to act too \"pro-town\" is the only case against me, then he proceeds to tell me that \"trying to act pro-town\" is the reason I'm in trouble. TL;DR: I have a gut town read, but I don't like his back and forth reluctance to hop on my wagon.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Lord Mhork</span> - Leaning Scum - Post #17, he says he's reluctant to let the self vote go. Next time he brings it up, in post #96, he let's the self vote go to jump on so other vulnerable targets. Strangely enough, he keeps his vote on NS, even though he's dismissed the self vote to hydra dissonace and not being alignment indicative. Then, in post #101, he says he is voting notSakura because of the self vote. This makes no sense since Mhork has already dismissed the self vote and is a weak excuse to continue having his vote on NS when he attacked me heavily in post #96. Mhork contradicting himself, and backtracking certainly doesn't look good for town does it? In post #109 he votes me, what happened to that self vote he backtracked on and said he was voting NS for? Why vote me now? I also don't like his post #149. There are definitely plenty of times where claiming is good and can help town.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">fuzzybutternut</span> - Null Leaning Scum - Post #55 is just plain scummy. The entire time this game Fuzzy has been far too eager to jump on others cases and redirect attention away from himself. Post #110 is so fucking scummy. No this is not OMGUS, this really is scummy. Look at that post, do you see how easily he hops on my bandwagon, he is very very eager to direct attention away from him and hops on my wagon for little to no reason. Post #112, apparently I can't ask for people to have actual reasons for voting me. Fuzzy just hops on my wagon and deflects my question on why he hopped on for no reason. Post #120... Again deflects my question. \"There only BS reasons to you buddy.\" Fuzzy's reason (if you can call it that) was BS, he provided little to no reason to join my wagon and tried to do so as quietly as possible, when I called him out on it he redirects attention on to me.<br><br>I strongly suspect that both Lord Mhork and Fuzzy are scum.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Porkens</span> - Null - I tried not to include null reads in the post, but there are a few things that are a bit odd about Porkens, can't decide whether they are scummy or not though. First of all, Porkens has been fence sitting this entire game. He stuck with his RVS vote and is afraid to vote anyone else, he says he doesn't know where else to vote, but I find that hard to believe with the two main wagons being myself and Fuzzy. Perhaps Porkens is town who just doesn't have an opinion, or maybe scum not trying to anger anyway. I encourage Porkens to actually vote someone, or keep your vote on Ztife, but only for good reasons. You need to formulate opinions, fence sitting the entire game will not help town.<br><br>Anyone else I didn't mention I either don't have a read on, is null, or there just isn't enough to go off of.<br><br>Please reread my Lord Mhork section and hop on on his wagon.

First of all I point out hydra dissonance as not being alignment indicative. Then I tell dann that meta is dumb. Then I explained post 6.

This is him cut and pasting from the mafia wiki to explain what hydra dissonance is in a post that has no other purpose. That is fluff posting trying to look town and thus very scummy.

Then I explain to dann why he is completely and totally wrong about the self vote, followed by a fluffy 'but town would never do this I don't understand because I'm town guize' post. Then again I call him out on fluff with no real use. Then I talk to porky and Mr. E Roll. Then I repeat to dann that my reasons are my business. Then a BUNCH of chatter not directed at dann.

Then more other stuff.<br><br>The point of me reading my post to do, which apparently you can do, is to show you that dann was in no way being put into a spotlight he can't handle.

Doesn't mean I'm convinced that he's town, and I'm calling it a mislynch as I think others would be a better lynch. I however, didn't really know it'd be possible to pull them off as people were convinced on Dann and there's need of consensus when a lynch has to be made. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5269315#p5269315\" class=\"postlink\">post 255</a>, Mr E Roll wrote:</cite>This means you are trying to convince us that you haven\u2019t relinquished your town read on Dann. <br></div></blockquote><br>No, I am not sure.

Just because I think Mhork could be scum doesn't make him scum, and therefore I cannot be sure that Mhork is bussing.

And if you read my previous posts, when I realised town could settle for a not dann lynch that's what I voted for. I said I could see him being scum but I wouldn't even flinch if he flipped town. As I said all the time since my maybe third post or what it was, I can settle with Mhork, Fuzzy and Dann and wanted Fuzzy the most when I saw Fuzzy being a possibility what did I do?

It's evident that scum was not roleblocked, else the RB would have told us who to lynch D2. And from his point of view a doc'ed target N1 would be likely doc'ed again N2 because of confirmed town status and the such. This suggests that it would be suboptimal play for Ztife-scum to attempt a kill on the same player that he did N1.<br><br>Since E Roll flipped 1shot BP on N2 I'd say he was probably the target on N1 as well (or he was shot twice N2). Using these two points \"Ztife-scum probably would not attempt a kill on the same player twice\" and \"Scum have probably attempted a kill on the same player twice\" I deduce that Ztife is probably town.<br><br>Your move."}

The player who actively ignores me when I've made a good point is absolutely scum. You voted me because I *somehow* knew DP was expecting a reaction, and deliberately hid mine. What you've failed to show is the evidence to suggest that I actually knew I was being tested. If your vote is genuine then surely you must have seen something, ANYTHING related to deliberate reaction-hiding. As it stands, it honestly feels like you tried to pull a reason out of the thin fucking air as an excuse to vote me.<br><br>How about it? Gonna explain your vote on me or are you much more comfortable <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5316413#p5316413\" class=\"postlink\">shifting attention towards elle and ztife</a>? I can guarantee I won't shut up about this unless you nightkill me so it's probably in your best interest to stop ignoring me. It's really not a good strategy.<br><br>And y'know..listing those \"many reasons\" to vote me or Porkens would be nice.

I'm moving Elle to town because I just realized something. Mhork was Shadi's scumread yet Shadi was perfectly content in following Mhork while making statements such as that. It looks like him playing safe and using mhork as a fallboy. Porkens is probably town based on Shadi's ISO. His only response to Ztife looks very distancy. However, I'm not sure DP isn't his scumbuddy anymore. So, one scum between Mhork and Fuzzy and one between DP and Ztife. <br><br>Because I know it'll be asked, my reads all shifted after reading through his ISO.

At the time I considered the possibility of Masons or perhaps NS had an inno investigation on fuzzy, but my feelings have since dissipated (even moreso after the massclaim) and now it just looks like some obnoxious scumplay that I still don't fully understand. And I'm confident enough in my Mhork and elle townreads to label Toomai as scum through PoE as well."}
