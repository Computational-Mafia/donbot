It boils down to this, scum would know that it can't be a 9 player game if there were 3 of them (this argument is invalid if we have 2 Mafia and a SK/Arso) outside of that it's a fair assumption there is probably 3 Mafia, town who decided to not read the setup could possibly say 9 instead of 13. Hence why Cloud said lying scum or townslip. Though if it turns out to be an SK game it can easily have been a scum slip too as Mafia should only have 2 members with and SK I think.<br>-reguardless the argument that Cloud was part of a 4 Mafia team because of the die is pretty much one of the stupidest points I ever saw.<br>While cloud is right Mini seems to be talking a lot about what scum do I don't really think that is AI in particular at this point."}

The intention isn't to gamethrow, it's to try to get a free pass for being scummy. As long as it looks like a joke, townies ignore it and may start townreading you for 'playing risky'.<br><br>Example: Harkonnen in Open 656. He pulled that trick a few times on Day 1 and became a universal town read thanks to it. He was town that game but literally nothing stopped scum!him from doing the same.

Everyone's townread had suddenly evaporated.<br><br>My point is, it's becoming something of a trend and now that I've been fooled a couple times by it, I'm not going to let it slide anymore.

However I think she's wrong and that Cloud is town. <br><br>Generally in my experience scum are relaxed under pressure whilst town panic. I'm guessing this is because scum know they're lying and are expecting (on some level at least) to be caught out. Town however see a wagon as a betrayal - their own allies are turning on them. Therefore when experiencing pressure scum will tend to reply carefully and calmly whilst town will flail wildly. I'm seeing a lot of flailing from cloud. Most particularly him receiving a moderate push from Mini and unleashing a full voiced, totally unironic OMGUS in response. It reads a lot like tunneling something which isn't really beneficial for scum. Maybe it's all just wifom and I've been taken in but for now I'll give him a pass."}

The first one could just be reasonably looking to get more content out of Cloud. The second one addressed to Mini seems to be an invitation for her to run with the idea that the D9 is a scum slip. Something which I've been informed by no fewer than 3 other players definitely could not be the case. I'm not sure why you did not correct me on this and instead appeared to agree with me.</div></blockquote><br>After the fact CK said that he thought the game was a micro with 9 players which is a very understandably reason that he used the D9 so that first quote you presented is null. The second post you have there is aimed at MDS because she is the one that i am more comfortable addressing and talking with in this game. I addressed it towards her because i genuinely wanted her outlook on the situation. I have sense dropped the idea that the D9 situation meant anything, it is a mistake that CK made and he has addressed that. I really dont know what you wanted me to correct you on. If you drop a bag and dont notice it do you want 4 people pointing at it and telling you that you dropped it? No, 1 or 2 people will do. I didnt point out that the die situation wasnt a scumslip, i just dropped it and moved on."}

My opinion of CloudKicker is mostly anchored in the \"Town slip\" business (mistaking the number of players in the game); I find it relatively unlikely that CloudKicker decides to fake this. I think that I have a good question that will help me be certain. My opinion of MiniDeathStar is mostly anchored in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8591603#p8591603\">154</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8591606#p8591606\">155</a> (reconsidering the read on CloudKicker when many players seemed inclined to agree with MiniDeathStar rather than CloudKicker means forfeiting an easy opportunity to be on the \"right\" side--that is, the popular side--of an argument with a Town player unless both are Mafia, and I think that CloudKicker is unlikely to display such hostility to MiniDeathStar at this stage in the game if both are Mafia).<br><br>I'm undecided on Secret Agent Jin and have not much useful to say there at this time.

Ordinarily I consider these things to indicate Town alignment and effort to solve the game; in this case I have a vague feeling that they don't conform to my previous experience with Flubbernugget as Town, so I will check that at some point to be certain.<br><br>I'm agreeing with Aj the Epic in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8592895#p8592895\">178</a> that the vote from Io in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8592580#p8592580\">166</a> doesn't seem to have a good reason for the vote. Also of importance to me is that the other major read that Io seems to have is that CloudKicker is Town, but she fails to make a meaningful attempt to interpret votes on that wagon (in particular, in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8589008#p8589008\">87</a> she declines to cast a vote despite having reasons to be suspicious of -Grey- and Kairal that are, as best as I can see, <span style=\"font-style: italic\">stronger</span> than her reason for voting for Aj the Epic).<br><br>That's it for my first pass.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: CloudKicker</span><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Io</span>"}

My semantic issue doesn't change my opinion, and you're trying to extrapolate shit that isn't there from it.</div></blockquote><br><br>Ok I went back through AJ's ISO. These are the 3 posts discussing it. I'm a bit more sympathetic to Grey's argument now. It is weird that he specifically says confbias can come from scum then clarifies that he DOESN'T mean confbias he means tunneling (which... presumably only comes from town?). I dunno it's still semantics at heart but... yeah it's a bit weird.<br><br>I was actually looking for the post which convinced me he was town the first time. Basically he initially calls out CK for being anti-town but suggests we should move on. I see how there can be scum motivation for this. However when I say I think Cloud looks like flailing town AJ suggests that most experienced players are good enough at faking it that I shouldn't read much into it. That's effectively an attack on cloud rather than a defense. I initially read this as being contrary to scum motives (if they're partners why initially defend and then attack?) (if Aj is the scum and CK is town then surely CK is an easy mislynch so why defend in the first place?). Thinking it over a bit more I guess he could be hoping to get a mislynch without actually doing it himself, and then after the town flip he could be all \"I told you he was prob town\".<br><br>So yeah I dunno. Grey's case isn't as bad as I thought and the reason I was town reading him is pretty flimsy. Most of the rest of his posts are meta or semantics fluff that doesn't really help. That's all getting a bit suspicious. On the other hand I still think the other two votes on him without any reasoning feel a bit scummy.<br><br>I'm not quite ready to vote him yet. I want to hear more of why those other two did but I'm leaning towards it. Sorry Grey. It was unfair for me to dismiss your case as a bad one."}

As I've said, I feel CK's play there was anti-town (aka looking at himself instead of others) but still NAI. Newman should've been tasked at building a case to actually make something happen rather than just stating he didn't like CK. At that point in time, nothing was happening with CK as a wagon so he either needed to drop it and refocus or force a real reason behind it. <br><br>So that's what I've got on Newman for the 4 posts so far."}

There's a large time range from flubber's start to end there. It's actually 50 minutes worth of time. <br>In this post, it's pretty clear you think Flubber, not massive, is scum. Yet you explicitly say Flubber is scum for doing the same things massive has done. This is by your own admission. <br><br>I know you're voting massive, so maybe this is assumed that they're scum together, but your vote took place in 371 (VC not really around so manually checked that). Your lack of vote change suggests you're still concerned with both, but you don't mention massive really at all other than as a point of comparison. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>MiniDeathStar wrote:</cite>If massive is mafia, Flubber could be a partner. Otherwise, not sure. I don't think he looked like an easily mislynchable low-hanging fruit at that time.<br></div></blockquote><br><br>Not sure I agree with this, simply on the basis that Flubber doesn't push it when there are points to be scored, and kinda shows up erratically at awkward times to push Massive's wagon. Assuming no time constrains (which, obviously isn't true), his BEST TIME to push this bus would've been right around when the discussion about CK/MDS alignment sameness reached a peak. Max investment in town read at the time. <br><br>I'm towards the opinion that Flubber obviously has some constrained windows (due to his post style of being so heavy and then completely absent) so maybe that theory won't hold as much weight. However, there was plenty of chances to push that wagon at a better time. It doesn't seem to be a good scum ploy to sit an RVS vote and intend to bus off that vote with minimal effort. Least amount of town points that can ever be gained for a bus, really. An inactive participant on a wagon with participation coming off RVS isn't going to buy much. <br><br>Under the circumstances, I think a massive scum flip would prove Flubber inno basically because this is terrible execution for a bus."}

The only issue is HelloNewman never actually interacts with anyone outside of CK and tunnels a bit that he's scum long after most of us have him as town. I don't mind contradictory viewpoints, but with an unpopular view comes a burden of proof, and I don't think Newman attempts that at all in his post. His reasoning CK is scum doesn't change at all (propped himself up on a townslip) even though he challenges CK multiple times through different wordings for the same thing. As I've said, I feel CK's play there was anti-town (aka looking at himself instead of others) but still NAI. Newman should've been tasked at building a case to actually make something happen rather than just stating he didn't like CK. At that point in time, nothing was happening with CK as a wagon so he either needed to drop it and refocus or force a real reason behind it. <br><br>So that's what I've got on Newman for the 4 posts so far.</div></blockquote><br><br>Building a case? It's day 1. The post you're referring to was on page 6 (if I recall correctly). I gave you my thoughts/read on what I felt was the scummiest play so far. To me, CK was not playing a pro town game. From \"hard claiming scum\", to feeling the need to remind everyone that he \"made a townslip\", to his bizarre fight with MDS. <br><br>Speaking of which.....<br><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8599219#p8599219\" class=\"postlink\">post 409</a>, -Grey- wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8598455#p8598455\" class=\"postlink\">post 374</a>, MiniDeathStar wrote:</cite>I'm going to repeat this: nobody has confirmed that CK and I share alignment.

We know this because the mod told us so. Now, I'm not saying that the mod \"lied\" when he later attempted to clarify. I believe that the mod accidentally said too much when announcing he was replacing Cloud, and was simply trying to cover for it and progress the game, hop get that would be the end of it. <br><br>So, Cloud was playing against his wincon. Which means that when he locked his vote onto MDS for the game, he was playing against his wincon. That is only accomplished in 1 way. If they are BOTH scum. If they are opposite alignments, then him voting her is not against wincon. If they were both town, then his voting her is not against wincon (because as town, Cloud would have no way of knowing that MDS was also town). However, if both are scum, that would punch the ticket. <br><br>I'm more than happy to lynch either MDS or Shadow today, preferably MDS.

The only issue is HelloNewman never actually interacts with anyone outside of CK and tunnels a bit that he's scum long after most of us have him as town. I don't mind contradictory viewpoints, but with an unpopular view comes a burden of proof, and I don't think Newman attempts that at all in his post. His reasoning CK is scum doesn't change at all (propped himself up on a townslip) even though he challenges CK multiple times through different wordings for the same thing. As I've said, I feel CK's play there was anti-town (aka looking at himself instead of others) but still NAI.

His reason for the initial tunnel was also pretty trash with it just being that he claimed scum which no one should even take seriously. The other part of his scum read of Cloud that they were overly pushing the town slip was OK and a valid argument I think. The reason I think he's not scum pushing for 2 mislynches, as he's pushing to lynch both of you, is just because of how genuine he is in the push itself. He is stubborn, but not scum.<br><br>Flubber I just don't really know about to be honest. He shares no read with me, and was very quick to town read AJ who I think is scum. Leaning scum though which would make me think Massive is town because he's done a few quick jabs on him, 2 and the RVS. <br><br>Side note, I'm not even that confident you are town either. I'm getting the Aj &amp; Culted scum team vibe with wither Mini or Flubber<br>Culted just really doesn't ever talk about AJ unless it was asking me to explain the AJ scum read, which Culted also said that other people asked so I don't see why Culted would have felt the need to talk about it. Then the only times he talked about you was at the very beginning asking for a read, something which I personally just notice a lot of scum do to partners they feel wont be too active or slightly scummy, then later on the talked about you and Flubber being TvT which is what is making me think one of you are scum. Culted is mostly a slight scum read for the lack of interactions with my stronger scum read and their overly nice behavior also just kind of feels disgenuine.<br>Honestly though I'm more confident that AJ and Culted are a scum team than you Mini. That's mostly because you're play style right now is basically mimicking how you played in 658, and it's not like I really disagree with you a ton. Though you and Culted do look pretty buddyey right now.</div></blockquote><br><br>And yet your strong scum read has no explanation backing it and you haven't addressed your own blunder (the 'time traveler' issue). Your entire scum/town read is based on an idea that I'm scum, who you've yet to give a reason for in 400 in-game posts. Now associative tells are cool and all but they require a flip, and you're so very far off base to begin with that you've drawn up three additional possible scum reads with no flip and no stated reason on why you think I'm scum. You've already called out an entire group to lynch through, day 1, no flips on 'associative tells'. <br><br>Also your post serves to have another contradiction. In the first line, you state Newman is the scummiest of the group, but town. Then you state Flubber is scum, who was part of the three in the first group. Actually through your entire post, you waffle on this scum/town read on Flubber. You don't have a definitive opinion on him, and basically go from town to scum in all the shades of the rainbow in one post. <br><br>Lastly, burden of proof's on you to EXPLAIN some of this. You've got some reads that are unpopular. Really, as I've stated, this starts with you explaining why I'm scum, and then showing interactions if associative tells are really your only shows altogether.</div></blockquote><br><br>I don't even know how to break up that post so I'll just do it in points.<br>\"Haven't addressed why you are scum\" - You lack reading comprehensions skills.<br>\"Time traveler\" - are you like high and making up terms right now?<br>\"no stated reason on why you think I'm scum.\" - 'cuz you don't actually read any of my posts for some reason.<br>\"In the first line, you state Newman is the scummiest of the group, but town.\" - Literally not a contradiction, you read the first line then stopped.

From \"hard claiming scum\", to feeling the need to remind everyone that he \"made a townslip\", to his bizarre fight with MDS. <br><br>Speaking of which.....<br><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8599219#p8599219\" class=\"postlink\">post 409</a>, -Grey- wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8598455#p8598455\" class=\"postlink\">post 374</a>, MiniDeathStar wrote:</cite>I'm going to repeat this: nobody has confirmed that CK and I share alignment.

I believe that the mod accidentally said too much when announcing he was replacing Cloud, and was simply trying to cover for it and progress the game, hop get that would be the end of it. <br><br>So, Cloud was playing against his wincon. Which means that when he locked his vote onto MDS for the game, he was playing against his wincon. That is only accomplished in 1 way. If they are BOTH scum. If they are opposite alignments, then him voting her is not against wincon. If they were both town, then his voting her is not against wincon (because as town, Cloud would have no way of knowing that MDS was also town). However, if both are scum, that would punch the ticket. <br><br>I'm more than happy to lynch either MDS or Shadow today, preferably MDS.

This is sort of a frustrating position because it means I'm likely to be wrong about a lot of stuff but can't necessarily trust people telling me I'm wrong (since they may be scum).

The best way to catch liars is to force them to generate a lot of content, and the best way to read town is again to see a lot of their content. It is harder to sustain lies long term. Therefore every player should be explaining their votes, and giving reads. If we don't do so we contribute to an atmosphere that makes the game easier for scum.<br><br>There are other benefits to explaining votes and reads too. Like imagine you are town and get nightkilled tonight. You're now a confirmed town to the rest of us and we can pick through your Iso to get what we now know are definitely town based reads. Except we'd get almost nothing from reading yours. We'd know you genuinely suspect MDS and AJ. That's it. We wouldn't even really know why.<br><br>If I get nightkilled though town will have a very good feel for where I am and what I was thinking.

I'm undecided about <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8607061#p8607061\">547</a>; it might fit a similar pattern if HellloooNewman is Town but I don't feel confident in that read the way that I do about Flubbernugget, MiniDeathStar, Kairal, and Aj The Epic. (I sort of agree with the substance of <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8611813#p8611813\">635</a> by I Am Innocent in that I didn't like <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8607023#p8607023\">544</a> by HellloooNewman, but I think that there were good reasons for a Town player to move a vote to the larger wagon, just not the ones given by HellloooNewman)<br><br>At this time I prefer voting for Io to voting for Secret Agent Jin."}

She succeeded in buying town cred but because she never tried to throw suspicion or defend her scum buddy she lost by process of elimination. Scum want to look town but at some point have to start playing towards a scum objective or else they too will find themselves losing from PoE. In this case massive is a possible but not certain lynch - exactly the time for scum buddies to come forward and try to shift the wagon elsewhere.

I was thinking back to previous experience in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&amp;t=61720\" class=\"postlink\">Mini Normal 1669</a>, in which Flubbernugget was Town and tended to post very short snippets without much depth of analysis and certainly never referring to a read over multiple posts as he did in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8590719#p8590719\">135</a> in this game (it felt more like waiting passively for things to wander by rather than actively seeking to understand other players). However, that was a long time ago and in more recent Town games that I reviewed (<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=83&amp;t=68887\" class=\"postlink\">Micro 665</a>, <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=51&amp;t=68953\" class=\"postlink\">Open 658</a>) he was more thorough.<br><br>As it happens someone else in Micro 665 had this exchange with Flubbernugget:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8517971#p8517971\" class=\"postlink\">post 516</a>, TierShift wrote:</cite>I don't remember flub ever being so level-headed.</div></blockquote><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8518113#p8518113\" class=\"postlink\">post 517</a>, Flubbernugget wrote:</cite>That's because I don't work retail anymore</div></blockquote><br><br>That's persuasive to me; the slight change in style is a natural progression and therefore not a result of a change in alignment. To be sure I also checked a game in which Flubbernugget was Mafia (<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=83&amp;t=68700\" class=\"postlink\">Micro 652</a>) and found a similar style there.<br>So, from previous games I'm not concerned that the change in style indicates that Flubbernugget is Mafia. This allows me to go ahead trying to read this game. I stand by my earlier comments that Flubbernugget appears to be putting effort into reading other players in this game, and therefore read him as Town."}

Getting himself lynched? I didn't really need the towncredit from that. Getting me lynched? That's obviously bad, and the most it could do would be chain a next day lynch onto Shadow because of the \"mod confirmed alignment\" bs. Shadow is lynchbaity anyway. As for Jin, uhm.

Given the interactions that I reviewed earlier (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8612594#p8612594\">656</a>), I think that for Secret Agent Jin to be Mafia would require a number of players to be Town (Flubbernugget, MiniDeathStar, Kairal, Aj The Epic). Of those, after reading again I still feel confident about Aj The Epic and Kairal, moderately confident about MiniDeathStar, and less confident about Flubbernugget. Given also that I am independently reading Shadow_step (formerly CloudKicker) as Town, this leaves me with weird hodgepodge POE teams, but I don't really have a lot of...well, it's some concept similar to degrees of freedom, I just can't think how to phrase it...to contemplate teams in which Secret Agent Jin is Town because I rate culted at least as likely to be Town as Flubbernugget is.<br><br>I don't really even have many questions to ask either, which is also weird. I'm going to work very hard on reading the rest of the game again and massive in particular because I don't feel like I have a good handle on this."}

We've effectively had three lynches (I'm considering Newman a lynch protected by a role claim) and missed on all three. Obviously we're not thinking this through right. <br><br>IaI, you questioned us all on our want to lynch Dierfire. Outside of Ehable, is there any specific reason? Also, with the Jin vote the only thing I saw in your ISO was that you weren't happy with his joke vote (Which Grey did the post prior). Was it just second on the list/best remaining option? <br><br>FWIW I completely agree with Massive that the hammer by Kairal did NOT need to happen, but I've been townreading Kairal as essentially a confirmed town member. <br><br>Not feeling a massive lynch anymore. Especially now that it seems like it'd be too easy to push, this is exactly where I'd warn against seeing a wagon form unless we have good reason. Think I'd prefer to look around CK's slot again as Shadowstep's done literally nothing with it since replacing in. We need to hear more from culted because my initial town read is basically stale on that slot (Culted almost didn't post yesterday). <br><br>I think looking towards Dier (depending on IaI's response)/Flubber/Shadow area might be best for today. Looking towards, not wagoning. We have two weeks, apathy aside we should burn a decent portion of it."}

I just thought it was really odd. As town I'd always get upset and emotional when I'm about to be lynched, but as scum I'm more composed and level-headed because I know I'm evil.

By this time, I had called it, as had Kairal (255) and Dierfire (275). Granted, Shadow hadn't replaced in yes (replaces in p345) but the post (167) isn't so far in front of these to not see them, especially mine which came literally the next page. Even then, there has been a lot to happen up until 167 (specifically with CK slot, which he now reads from his conf-alignment view) and doesn't respond to any of it whatsoever. Either he's realized that it isn't particularly relevant for whatever reason (it still was as of 167) or he didn't respond to it for...??? <br></li><li>677 Shadow calls Grey scum. As of this post, his vote is still on MDS, but does not move the vote. He's still on his re-read since the respond is Grey's 375. Realizes two posts later Grey was playing a game here. Specifically I find this weird for a few reasons. I think naturally Shadow would unvote MDS IF HE BELIEVED THE LOGIC he uses in 677 (game got a lot easier w/mod confirmed shit). MDS shares alignment, right? Grey's scum complaining about free pass? Natural progression says that vote moves and then comes off in 681 when he reads through the entire sequence. <br></li><li>So in 683 we can assume Grey scumread is dropped. Replaces with Newman/Io scumreads. No reason given, votes Newman. Doesn't post at all during Io run up and eventual lynch. Votes off D2 with an IAI vote, who had L-1 on Io, his scum read. No explanation here, it's that awkward re-RVS stage that happened early D2. When called on it, it's the quoted post above (reaction test, no reads...). <br></li><li>There's a question put out to massive (p903) (why did he revote newman after claim) but no attempts to revote even after response. Just two irrelevant questions and then 8 IRL days inactivity, coming back with his first interaction with Kairal, asking if Shadow was next on the mislynch list. This:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8671964#p8671964\" class=\"postlink\">post 981</a>, Kairal wrote:</cite>I think the main thing I want right now is to see a bit more from Shadow.</div></blockquote><br><br>Is Kairal's part of the post that prompted Shadow saying: <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8673742#p8673742\" class=\"postlink\">post 983</a>, Shadow_step wrote:</cite>So it seems I'm your next ml target Kairal?<br>I'l get caught up during the weekend.<br>Meanwhile what is everyone's read on Kairal?</div></blockquote><br><br>It's a pretty severe overreaction. He hasn't mentioned Kairal at all before this post, and suddenly wants 'everyone's read on kairal' for suggesting (completely correctly) that we need to hear more from Shadow. Even considering the longass night 2, it had been just under 80 posts and Shadow at this point had little to no content. <br></li><li>1010 where he highlights the earliest parts of Grey's iso to apparently strike up something against me, even labeling it 'important posts from grey's iso' and then fails to commentate on it at all.

Shadow's overreaction to Kairal and then inability to push anything towards me even though his motives obviously suggest he's thinking about it. I'm slightly baffled by 1010 because I think it's so bad that I can't imagine someone actually trying that as either alignment. Literally the definition of throwing shade, since he wouldn't even VOTE off of it. <br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Shadow_step</span><br><br>I still want to know why you think this slot is town, because there's literally nothing in Shadow's iso to prove it. I'm also pretty sure he's still not caught up, because in one of his posts in the 800 range, he quoted a post from Jhin from the 370 range. This was D2, so he obviously had TIME to read through, but just opted not to. This game is one of the shortest games you could replace into and he didn't get through that."}

MDS has a few oddities of play thus far (specifically the use of Io reads as her own until called on it) but nothing super noticeable besides that. If I'm not mistaken, MDS also did this to Flubber earlier in the game (calling him on sheeping reads). She also calls Jin lynchbait like once (rather than 5x), and the other time is actually a call on Shadow being lynch bait, not SaJ. While her read on Jin is waffled a bit, I think it's more a scumread on her part and a defense against Flubber's accused team of Massive/SaJ/MDS. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>culted wrote:</cite>The second half of the saj runup was whimsical and if I'd have been around I probably would have embarrassed myself. : 3<br><br><br><br>massive kinda takes the runup into a more serious zone by being the first person to really try and make a case (at least that day) and gives some pretty OKAY reasons like despite the buzzwords I could follow the thought process on jin seeming more hesitant with voting in certain contexts.<br><br>Then good old grey.<br><br>And then kairal.</div></blockquote><br><br><br>Honestly Grey was really into the Jin lynch. The issue is, no one in the town (outside Jin) really was interested in stopping it. Dierfire in 656 and 935 showed a logical progression that should've had him believing jin as scum (It was conditional on Newman being town, which was found after N1). Everyone voting Jin (other than arguably Kairal) was scumreading Jin. MDS... didn't seem interested in stopping it, and I'm inclined to believe hers was more a scumread on jin than a townread. Shadow doesn't mention Jin once outside a random quote (\"how do you know me\" essentially). Which really leaves me, who was townreading Jin but didn't really do anything to prevent it. The lynch was going to happen, it's more a question of the hammer time."}

Cloud's early posting seemed like the same fake \"I'm scum, wink wink\" bs posting he did in mhsmith's game and Shadow was very inactive which is not like his towngame at all - I've seen him as town twice. <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">@Mod</span> - I'm a little confused by what's happening. Could you do me a favor and update the OP and tell me a) What day we are in, b) full list of dead people, c) who replaced who, and d) links to start of each day. Thanks!"}

I think one was with Titus (who replaced in late day 1) and Lunafox, but i don't explicitly remember if you were in that one. Your play was crisp in that mastin2 game but the town should've never let you get away with 2 cops like that. Also the scum team had control of that game all the way through."}

This is my first time replacing! (mainly cause the cue was a large game and multi-ball Yuk!) so here I am <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\"> Normally I like to make a statement second post but as Im replacing I think i'll just do it here.<br><br>Firstly; I call Town Green and Mafia Reds. this is cause I think the use of Scum and Scummy is kinda mean to say to people who are just playing a game and red and green are much nicer terms. I mean its not like you getta hand select roles <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\"> This is just a thing to bare in mind going forward.<br><br>Secondly; This entire post is NAI. I post this as both alignments the only thing changing being the wording as I tend to just rephrase it a little each game to try and get better wording. You can check this in my Green meta on my Wiki page. as all newer games (prob the last 4 or 5) have this kinda statement (normally on my second iso post)<br><br>Finally; I have an abnormal play style. Unlike the meta on this site I tend to do things that help me survive as both alignments. Sometimes that means bending things to a point and other times it means I'll do LAMIST things for no good reason other than I don't wanna die. I also play with a very open hand though. This is beacuse I feel that being open and forward helps keep me alive with Green members and help me decide who is green and who is red. I struggle when pressured and if I'm pressured by a lot of people my reads get tilted as I am prone to confirm bais at times and unless I have a healthy view point its hard to get reads. additionally if my big reads go wrong I sorta get lost and confused until I can refind my footing. I'm telling you this as Its something that Red players can use to push my misslynch and green players can get tricked by. Additionally as I make this statement as both alignments Its impossible to tell what I am using this statement. Think it a quick overview of green meta. You may look at any of my games on my wiki Ordered first to last to look for these trends but imo they are all there.  Other than that I tend to make long posts every so often and multiple shorter posts in between asking questions or looking into things that I find interesting. I like to exchange information freely to those who ask unless I have a plan that requires not telling people stuff (like I'm baiting a reaction for example) <br><br>And I guess I'll ask whats up with my slot right now while I start looking back at the game. I may spam the thread a bit while reading up as I react and ask questions on the fly. As of now I've replaced into this slot entirely blind to the game."}

No that wasn't a thing and snap shut the trap. This is a thing in the wiki. I did it once to quickly terminate a RVS. Its a highly risky manuver though cause if you fuck it up or reveal it wrong your just gonna end up being under a lot of heat forever. like CK it was a poorly executed one that wasn't designed to catch reds but show them as green which doesn't work the slayer gambits green credit comes from the oh snap and I see what you did there reactions. So yeah.. There is also site meta, which Is why I cover my ass with my meta-post as I go against meta as Green which makes it harder to get an alignment read. Though I can tell you my slayer gambit worked it was offsite so.. not on my wiki. I timed it to be just long enough that people just started to turn generally sour. didn't try to make it out like I was trying to be red to confirm myself as green lol either. CK's start was poorly executed."}

My opinion of MiniDeathStar is mostly anchored in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8591603#p8591603\">154</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8591606#p8591606\">155</a> (reconsidering the read on CloudKicker when many players seemed inclined to agree with MiniDeathStar rather than CloudKicker means forfeiting an easy opportunity to be on the \"right\" side--that is, the popular side--of an argument with a Town player unless both are Mafia, and I think that CloudKicker is unlikely to display such hostility to MiniDeathStar at this stage in the game if both are Mafia).<br><br>I'm undecided on Secret Agent Jin and have not much useful to say there at this time.

They're my one constant outside any death flips: I know their role, their alignment and can glean their reasoning. A lot of people advocate reading their prior's iso, I generally avoid it because they probably came under fire for their play and for their reads, so I consider them less reliable overall, even if I accept them as honest opinions. It's very rare that you'll replace into a conftown or really pro-town slot so I normally talk with the current discussion and figure out how fucked the slot is. if it's not getting lynched for certain, I re-read a bit and develop scum reads. If my slot is an issue, I'll claim what I feel is needed. <br><br>A few issues I have specifically with this (because yeah, it's pretty common to be frustrated with a replace-in slot [see above: rarely ever viewed as protown]) is Naomi's claim that she does a lot of LAMIST. Yeah, we've seen that. However, CK did the same thing and when we're talking about an ahmished tell, I'd expect that part to bother her a lot less considering these two have very similar play in many aspects concerning how they carry themselves. <br><br>That and the fact that I feel a lot of information Naomi has missed has felt intentional. Newman, Grey and Jin were quoted more than anyone else in her reread. Very rarely can a person alive actually account for the person of interest to her questions. More importantly, take the quoted Jin post from last page that she used as an attack on Flubber. Jin's dead and flipped green, making the opinion potentially 'more impactful' to us because we know his alignment. But in the same breath, it's caused Naomi to do nothing more than agree with it instead of offering her own arguments because hey, Jin was honest to god town. I feel as though Naomi isn't telling the truth when she acts like she didn't know Neman/Grey/Jin were dead. Hell, on read throughs, I do ISO people and the corner button to check activity is used often. It would easily trigger that all three had been replaced out or dead. There's just no way that she hasn't realized something's wrong here."}

Obviously Jin's alignment is very important for determining the alignment of people pushing to kill him- since he's town they might be scum.<br><br>At any rate these recent posts by culted: A) attempt to mislynch me which I predicted scum trying to do, B) attempts to cast doubt on massive's cop claim- not definitely a scum action but helpful for scum to push, C) continues to defend Flubber, only making me more certain you're a scum team D) attempts to move some heat onto Naomi, which fits into my theory that she's not your scum buddy.<br><br>In short these posts present a few reasons why you might be scum and don't deviate in the slightest from how I'd expect you to play as scum."}

His reason for the initial tunnel was also pretty trash with it just being that he claimed scum which no one should even take seriously. The other part of his scum read of Cloud that they were overly pushing the town slip was OK and a valid argument I think. The reason I think he's not scum pushing for 2 mislynches, as he's pushing to lynch both of you, is just because of how genuine he is in the push itself. He is stubborn, but not scum.<br><br>Flubber I just don't really know about to be honest. He shares no read with me, and was very quick to town read AJ who I think is scum. Leaning scum though which would make me think Massive is town because he's done a few quick jabs on him, 2 and the RVS. <br><br>Side note, I'm not even that confident you are town either. I'm getting the Aj &amp; Culted scum team vibe with wither Mini or Flubber<br>Culted just really doesn't ever talk about AJ unless it was asking me to explain the AJ scum read, which Culted also said that other people asked so I don't see why Culted would have felt the need to talk about it. Then the only times he talked about you was at the very beginning asking for a read, something which I personally just notice a lot of scum do to partners they feel wont be too active or slightly scummy, then later on the talked about you and Flubber being TvT which is what is making me think one of you are scum. Culted is mostly a slight scum read for the lack of interactions with my stronger scum read and their overly nice behavior also just kind of feels disgenuine.<br>Honestly though I'm more confident that AJ and Culted are a scum team than you Mini. That's mostly because you're play style right now is basically mimicking how you played in 658, and it's not like I really disagree with you a ton. Though you and Culted do look pretty buddyey right now.</div></blockquote><br><br>And yet your strong scum read has no explanation backing it and you haven't addressed your own blunder (the 'time traveler' issue). Your entire scum/town read is based on an idea that I'm scum, who you've yet to give a reason for in 400 in-game posts. Now associative tells are cool and all but they require a flip, and you're so very far off base to begin with that you've drawn up three additional possible scum reads with no flip and no stated reason on why you think I'm scum. You've already called out an entire group to lynch through, day 1, no flips on 'associative tells'. <br><br>Also your post serves to have another contradiction. In the first line, you state Newman is the scummiest of the group, but town. Then you state Flubber is scum, who was part of the three in the first group. Actually through your entire post, you waffle on this scum/town read on Flubber. You don't have a definitive opinion on him, and basically go from town to scum in all the shades of the rainbow in one post. <br><br>Lastly, burden of proof's on you to EXPLAIN some of this. You've got some reads that are unpopular. Really, as I've stated, this starts with you explaining why I'm scum, and then showing interactions if associative tells are really your only shows altogether.</div></blockquote><br><br>I don't even know how to break up that post so I'll just do it in points.<br>\"Haven't addressed why you are scum\" - You lack reading comprehensions skills.<br>\"Time traveler\" - are you like high and making up terms right now?<br>\"no stated reason on why you think I'm scum.\" - 'cuz you don't actually read any of my posts for some reason.<br>\"In the first line, you state Newman is the scummiest of the group, but town.\" - Literally not a contradiction, you read the first line then stopped. If you would have bothered to continue reading you would have seen the explanation as to why he is bad and why the only scummy thing he did was tunnel.<br>\"You don't have a definitive opinion on him\" - Slight scum<br>\"Lastly, burden of proof's on you to EXPLAIN some of this.\" - Which I did.<br>'You've got some reads that are unpopular.\" - That's not a reason to scum read that's called actually bothering to look at someone without just sheeping the crowd.<br>\"Really, as I've stated, this starts with you explaining why I'm scum\" - I did and you chose to ignore them.</div></blockquote><br><br>Given this post I'm entirely sure I'm just being paranoia about AJ as he pulled a thing back here sorta like what happened now and I think its just more his 'style' than anything else."}

Tracker has pure counter in Ninja, JK has more chance to hit town PRs, neighborizor in general is a rather weak role because it relies on A) Neighborizor being townread and B) Neighborizior not hitting scum and getting influenced. Admittedly 1-shot Ninja isn't a great consistent counter but realize that a tracker is normally weaker than a cop (aka in that game it had a 1/12 chance of tracking the actual kill, where a cop has a 1/4 chance of finding scum in this size game). <br><br>My guess is if scum doesn't have a RB, they'll have a GF then. There's almost no case where scum doesn't have a pure counter to an investigative role and cops are countered by sanity, role block, Godfather, Miller... I think that's it. In Normals, I believe sanity isn't allowed, and I've already expressed why I'm confident RB doesn't exist. Miller proper play is to claim early.  <br><br>Town also lost that game you pulled up, so it kinda reinforces my idea that the town was a bit weak.

At least, not before massive/flubber and probably shadow. <br><br>I don't believe grey makes a play to JK newman. Grey knows Newman needs a result to show that he's town and Grey won't interfere with that. Even if Grey protects Newman and no kill comes through, was it newman making the kill or was scum trying to kill newman? More importantly, a JK blocking newman doesn't stop a RB from doing the same and scum killing elsewhere/testing that BP claim. I'm not sure how many players in this game would miss this crucial piece: Newman NEEDED a clear/indictment if he were to survive D2. Pretty sure it's near 0. <br><br>Sure no one's going to believe a cop claim in LYLO without a crumb. But in this case, what's actually the difference? He doesn't have to produce another read until the day after tomorrow, and scum could gambit that that day never happens or that his cop just conveniently dies. And if I'm not mistaken, even getting that far still represents lylo for town. To which the game is cleared before a third clear is ever made. Do you see why this claim is so incredibly suspect? <br><br>Do I want to lynch massive? Yes. More than I did before the claim. I'm nigh positive it's a fake claim because the context around it isn't good. However, as of right now I'd prefer Naomi because there are provable contradictions in what she's said. My question on massive is a claim that is so incredibly suspect that should I have the ability to afford a lynch, I'd be lynching him. But to avoid lylo from here on out, we MUST lynch scum today."}

Personally I looked through his ISO and he looks fine to me. By which I mean he has a reasonable number of posts and doesn't seem afraid to create solid interactions with people, and is actively creating content. Now sure my reads are often poop as previously established but if you post persuasive arguments as to why he should be lynched maybe I'll vote him too :p.</div></blockquote><br><br>As red you'd have no real reason to make people out to be less red for easily ML's So it makes sense to me that their Red.</div></blockquote><br>The last line doesn't make any sense. <br>I don't understand how kairal is trying to make aj a less likely mislynch here all he's doing is asking people why there's votes on him; if anything that's opening the door for him to get more votes."}

Now ... Coming from a town perspective, You just had someone claim your role, someone you thought was red. then you just let them go. You don't chew them out you don't push you don't even type words. you just blank vote and vanish... That is not Green play. In my mind. If I get counter claimed. As green the first thing I do is declare it. this all most always results in the other person or myself getting lynched. Now lets time warp and look what the odds are. If you think there red and your green. You would of had a 90% chance to killing a person you thought was red D1. As the majority of town had voted with 2 declaring intent. That kinda cloud doesn't vanish instantly. You see... here is what I think Actually happened though. you thought it was 100% that you'd die. why? because as red lying about your role (declaring your a cop) and entering in a 1v1 is a bad idea unless your going to win the game off of it (like In Lylo or Mylo. If you'd countered claimed they would of flipped green and a cop and then the crowd would of turned bad. <br><br>So here is a quick round up here.<br>If Massive knew the alignment of Newman. then counter claiming would result in him dying. however, if he didn't know their alignment and thought they was red like they was supposing at the time of the claim. Then there would be no reason not to counter claim as if they DO flip red. you've just confirmed your slot and gotten rid of mafia which is a good trade."}

Cloud's nonsense is bad play for both alignments, Shadow's lurkiness seemed like it could be scummy but he replaced out for it suggesting it wasn't a deliberate strategy.

I guess one of them is bussing. Fine with me!</div></blockquote><br><br>Speaks for itself. <br><br>Outside of that, there are multiple problems at play. <br><br>First, you're manufacturing reads and dropping your old ones entirely for no good reason. It's not natural at all. <br>Second, the method to develop your reads is flawed. It relies on flawed logic, it isn't a thorough case study of your own controls (scum won't all vote together, flawed in itself) and it doesn't add anything to pass the 'eye test' (aka how people have actually interacted). Add to it you add basically arbitrary variables and this starts to get scary with you basically looking to paint the results as you want. <br>Third, the results aren't good. As demonstrated above, you go from \"I scum read Flubber\" to \"I'm not scumreading him for unexplained reasons\" to \"I'm scumreading him because of his arbitrary on/off tendency on lynch wagons <span style=\"font-style: italic\">in relation to other players</span>. Let me remind you that town can be suspicious about others on their wagon, so it immediately poisons this without additional analysis. <br><br>My own conclusion is there's no way in hell these reads you have now could possible be good compared to reads developed through the entire game. Even people who are re-reading and re-accessing have a natural progression (but I didn't notice x, y, z when I first looked through / jin hadn't flipped yet so now I read this post this way). This was a readjustment of you reads that you already had before you started. That's why the on/off declaration of whose scum (even though ANYONE could be with your methods) came up with the results they did even though there's really nothing scientific behind it. Why do you go from Flubber/Culted/Massive --&gt;IAI? to Flubber/Naomi/Me? And now you randomly townread Culted. Enough to tell Naomi off about her read. There is something incredibly wrong with this, and while I can't tell what exactly your end goal with it is, you did this to manufacture new reads to suit you better as opposed to actually believing them. I work with huge sets of data and run all sorts of statistical tests... there's literally nothing in your last page that should instill you with that kind of confidence."}

It... doesn't make a lot of sense to me why he'd do it this way. Here's the thing: One of the major reasons I've townread Kairal for so long is his reads have been fluid, have had natural progression and have made sense, even if they're a bit weak or somewhat waffled (kairal gets talked out of a lot of shit that he really shouldn't...). Especially since kairal wouldn't have a read jump on flubber if it were predetermined. Ergo read the rest of this post with kairal!scum as the control.<br><br>My biggest question is why does Kairal keep flubber's read scum after this? We know the two options: Bus, Mislynch. I think bus can make sense here but mislynch lends to a more advantageous scum motive. Kairal scumreads both me and Naomi. At this point, had he decided, he could've convinced massive/myself rather easily to buy into Naomi before Flubber. That scenario assumes Naomi is town to pass the lynch off in the first place. If Flubber was scum with Kairal, Kairal could attempt to drag him into lylo. Course... it doesn't do much, I think Kairal/Flubber would be the next two lynches. <br><br>It'd actually have been more natural for Kairal to continue a scum read of flubber from beginning to end in a hard bus. Be adamant about the lynch, gain the most town points. Doing this casts a ton of suspicion on Kairal. And really, removing Culted/IAI/Massive from her scumread list is a lot easier than going through this theatrical display. If Flubber was truly scum, this is a hard lynch to drop under any circumstance for a scum partner. Yet there are, as stated above, ways to do it. If he's town, Kairal could fumble on it, be insecure and not look super gung-ho on the lynch going into lylo for two lynches in a row that just look strange. <br><br>The drop of culted as a scum read in and of itself isn't awful. Well. Depends on your definition. Culted had been pressuring kairal pretty hard recently, and IaI, one of Kairal's other beginning scum reads, was/is pressing culted and it seems those two probably don't share an alignment. Had Kairal stated one of the two to be scum, it makes more sense. Picking a side that he believes is probably more useful to the town because it's an opinion and it's someone arguing for/against what's happening. Instead, from the looks of things, Kairal is seeing the entire thing as TvT. The piece of this that's important is culted had started to slip into the null area for a lot of people but IaI so it'd be pretty easy to bust out an easy town read. Is it possible to town read culted? Sure, but I think it's pertinent in 'reaccessing' reads to at least address IaI's point on that. In a way, this read change both follows Kairal's trend of being incredibly easy to persuade but also breaks the mold by not having really put a lot of consideration into it (as I'd argue the entire theory followed suit).<br><br> P-edit: Even with it being a response about culted's reads, it doesn't change the fact that culted has been completely dropped from Kairal's scum reads. <br><br>As far as I know, Naomi wasn't a strong scum read of Culted prior to this. I've mentioned this is odd that Kairal scumreads both Naomi and I (since we've done nothing but argue with me scumreading her, and my read on CK/Shadow/Naomi has been NAI to scum most of the game). Kairal amends it that he thinks it's TvS in 1467, but does little to explain why or who's the extra person. In fact, it's another written-in mislynch that he ADMITS to. A day away from Lylo he's giving himself a mislynch chance on a 50/50. Let's go back to Flubber being innocent for a moment. IF flubber is innocent, LYLO occurs tomorrow and scum have 3 of the 4 remaining. More than likely, they'd take that bet at a 50/50 between Naomi and I and pull ahead. Hell, they'd only need one person to vote me and then win it, so it's not really a 50/50. <br><br>More importantly, Kairal's done zilch for scumreading me all game and only started scumreading Naomi for the short period of time when Shadow came after her to naomi's replace in. And we're to believe off this method he's got a scumread strong enough to believe it on not even full VCA.  <br><br>If I had to guess, Kairal's indication shows Culted scum, Naomi scum, himself scum. Naomi is biased on my own read of her but unless I'm going to read Dierfire as scum, who's basically unmentioned and a consistent town read of mine, there's not a lot that makes sense from this perspective. Flubber could be scum here and it could just be a poorly executed bus/someone that scum has determined to not live through lylo either. The one flaw is Shadow did toss some shade at Kairal, which doesn't make a hell of a lot of sense, though it wasn't followed by a case nor vote so it was just shade. But between this, the Jin incident and some inconsistencies we've seen from Kairal today, I think this is it. <br><br>Culted/Kairal/Naomi|Flubber. <br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Kairal</span><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Kairal wrote:</cite>Ultimately though regardless of the method I've landed exactly on who Aj and Naomi claim is their top scum read.

If he was willing to put his fingerprints on a lynch as he's clearly done with Daya then why not do so with death? There's no consistency there.</span><br><br>So maybe he's scum just playing a risky gambit where he stands out from the crowd and draws a lot of attention early, and then plans to do what I said, until I called him out for it at which point he starts pushing Daya to throw me off. It's possible. But it's also really complicated and at a certain point you have to use Occam's razor. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">It's really vastly more likely that he's just a town player who doesn't like making reads or votes until he's very confident rather than the 4 dimensional chess I outlined above.</span></div></blockquote><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Kairal wrote:</cite>In short if Aelin is a passive defensive player why draw attention to herself by not voting?

For example, you say that it is unlikely that all Mafia players voted for Io, and therefore that either Naomi-Tan or Flubbernugget should be Mafia. If you look at their reads on Io (predecessor's read for Naomi-Tan), does one stand out to you as a Mafia player avoiding the wagon, or are you just tossing a coin?"}

I'm a person who hunts by motive anyways, so of course I'm not really going to agree with this. Kairal's VCA is flawed from the beginning since VCA is normally done over the entirety of the day, not just end of lynches. However, when Kairal suggests I should help him instead of calling him on the bad method, two issues arise. First, I can't actually do VCA. I play with people who do VCA but all I do is make sure it looks right. Secondly, I only call that VCA because that's what it looks closest to. Even VCA will use their own initial reads to benefit their hunt/eliminate certain scenarios. My first issue with Kairal's VCA was it wasn't conclusive. Sure he got results from it, but reading his logic, I didn't get anything close to it. What I got was any single person outside the cleared, cop claim and Kairal himself could be mafia. Not exactly a good way to go, considering now more than ever town reads need to be reinforced. <br><br>If you or Flubber is town, particularly you because you brought it up, I want to see you prove this. Mostly, give me a solid reason for your scum reads and stop playing the LAMIST card so much. AKA stop advocating for your own lynch. I don't buy that kind of stuff because it's all a category of WIFOM. To me, it's you or Flubber as the last mafia, which is why I'd prefer to have you two fight to stay alive as opposed to take a 50/50. <br><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>culted wrote:</cite><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8709148#p8709148\" class=\"postlink\">post 1492</a>, Aj The Epic wrote:</cite>snip</div></blockquote><br>First of all: lol @ the idea of me being scum with kairal.

I'm a person who hunts by motive anyways, so of course I'm not really going to agree with this. Kairal's VCA is flawed from the beginning since VCA is normally done over the entirety of the day, not just end of lynches. However, when Kairal suggests I should help him instead of calling him on the bad method, two issues arise. First, I can't actually do VCA. I play with people who do VCA but all I do is make sure it looks right. Secondly, I only call that VCA because that's what it looks closest to. Even VCA will use their own initial reads to benefit their hunt/eliminate certain scenarios. My first issue with Kairal's VCA was it wasn't conclusive. Sure he got results from it, but reading his logic, I didn't get anything close to it. What I got was any single person outside the cleared, cop claim and Kairal himself could be mafia. Not exactly a good way to go, considering now more than ever town reads need to be reinforced. <br><br>If you or Flubber is town, particularly you because you brought it up, I want to see you prove this. Mostly, give me a solid reason for your scum reads and stop playing the LAMIST card so much. AKA stop advocating for your own lynch.

It... doesn't make a lot of sense to me why he'd do it this way. Here's the thing: One of the major reasons I've townread Kairal for so long is his reads have been fluid, have had natural progression and have made sense, even if they're a bit weak or somewhat waffled (kairal gets talked out of a lot of shit that he really shouldn't...). Especially since kairal wouldn't have a read jump on flubber if it were predetermined. Ergo read the rest of this post with kairal!scum as the control.<br><br>My biggest question is why does Kairal keep flubber's read scum after this? We know the two options: Bus, Mislynch. I think bus can make sense here but mislynch lends to a more advantageous scum motive. Kairal scumreads both me and Naomi. At this point, had he decided, he could've convinced massive/myself rather easily to buy into Naomi before Flubber. That scenario assumes Naomi is town to pass the lynch off in the first place. If Flubber was scum with Kairal, Kairal could attempt to drag him into lylo. Course... it doesn't do much, I think Kairal/Flubber would be the next two lynches. <br><br>It'd actually have been more natural for Kairal to continue a scum read of flubber from beginning to end in a hard bus. Be adamant about the lynch, gain the most town points. Doing this casts a ton of suspicion on Kairal. And really, removing Culted/IAI/Massive from her scumread list is a lot easier than going through this theatrical display. If Flubber was truly scum, this is a hard lynch to drop under any circumstance for a scum partner. Yet there are, as stated above, ways to do it. If he's town, Kairal could fumble on it, be insecure and not look super gung-ho on the lynch going into lylo for two lynches in a row that just look strange. <br><br>The drop of culted as a scum read in and of itself isn't awful. Well. Depends on your definition. Culted had been pressuring kairal pretty hard recently, and IaI, one of Kairal's other beginning scum reads, was/is pressing culted and it seems those two probably don't share an alignment. Had Kairal stated one of the two to be scum, it makes more sense. Picking a side that he believes is probably more useful to the town because it's an opinion and it's someone arguing for/against what's happening. Instead, from the looks of things, Kairal is seeing the entire thing as TvT. The piece of this that's important is culted had started to slip into the null area for a lot of people but IaI so it'd be pretty easy to bust out an easy town read. Is it possible to town read culted? Sure, but I think it's pertinent in 'reaccessing' reads to at least address IaI's point on that. In a way, this read change both follows Kairal's trend of being incredibly easy to persuade but also breaks the mold by not having really put a lot of consideration into it (as I'd argue the entire theory followed suit).<br><br> P-edit: Even with it being a response about culted's reads, it doesn't change the fact that culted has been completely dropped from Kairal's scum reads. <br><br>As far as I know, Naomi wasn't a strong scum read of Culted prior to this. I've mentioned this is odd that Kairal scumreads both Naomi and I (since we've done nothing but argue with me scumreading her, and my read on CK/Shadow/Naomi has been NAI to scum most of the game). Kairal amends it that he thinks it's TvS in 1467, but does little to explain why or who's the extra person. In fact, it's another written-in mislynch that he ADMITS to. A day away from Lylo he's giving himself a mislynch chance on a 50/50. Let's go back to Flubber being innocent for a moment. IF flubber is innocent, LYLO occurs tomorrow and scum have 3 of the 4 remaining. More than likely, they'd take that bet at a 50/50 between Naomi and I and pull ahead. Hell, they'd only need one person to vote me and then win it, so it's not really a 50/50. <br><br>More importantly, Kairal's done zilch for scumreading me all game and only started scumreading Naomi for the short period of time when Shadow came after her to naomi's replace in. And we're to believe off this method he's got a scumread strong enough to believe it on not even full VCA.  <br><br>If I had to guess, Kairal's indication shows Culted scum, Naomi scum, himself scum. Naomi is biased on my own read of her but unless I'm going to read Dierfire as scum, who's basically unmentioned and a consistent town read of mine, there's not a lot that makes sense from this perspective. Flubber could be scum here and it could just be a poorly executed bus/someone that scum has determined to not live through lylo either. The one flaw is Shadow did toss some shade at Kairal, which doesn't make a hell of a lot of sense, though it wasn't followed by a case nor vote so it was just shade. But between this, the Jin incident and some inconsistencies we've seen from Kairal today, I think this is it. <br><br>Culted/Kairal/Naomi|Flubber. <br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Kairal</span><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Kairal wrote:</cite>Ultimately though regardless of the method I've landed exactly on who Aj and Naomi claim is their top scum read.

If there is something there good at its talking others into questioning themselves. Like Flubs and massive have had lots of pressure multiple times this game then they say something or someone does something right near flip. it blows up and then miss lynch. Take Massive D1, All the day everyone was red reading them (same for flubs today) and then right at the end out of no where IO's misslynch comes right off the back of MDS claiming a slip. Though the base arugement wasn't great it was presented in a very convincing way and misslynch. Most of town is paranoid as you can see by how scattered the reads are. If we cannot create a cohesive unit and suspect EVERYONE then we're just gonna die. <br><br>You may be wondering how I'm so clear right now; Its cause i am not looking for the reds. I look for the greens Reds don't want to be noticed while greens don't care. Reds need to give off green traits but still need to focus on Misslynches. While greens will give off consistent and persistent tells.  Kairal I want you to forget about links between players and pick out 4 people who you believe are Town due to the way they play, not poweroles. PR's can be faked interactions cannot be. Find your greens then check whats left. because if you find 4 greens. You have 4 people remaining. which gives you about a 75% chance of each being red.<br><br>Next consider which of your reads are red. look for connections and look for why they didn't make your green list. By the time you done this you should be having a clear understanding of who you feel is red and green. Its harder for red to convince you that your green reads are red and cause confusion and its harder for reds to hide from this POE style hunting."}

I am talking specifically to IamI, Dierfire, Naomi and BV. Well and massive now I guess.<br><br>Alright so massive's questions: My theory is that scum will make sure not to ever all agree with the same position (at least until it's been pointed out as seen in them all currently voting me). I agree that they won't take any other easy to recognize pattern. We can't assume that Flubber voted yes on every wagon or anything like that. What we can assume is that on every wagon (or major position in the case of the cop argument) at least one scum will disagree with the other two.<br><br>Now massive is quite right that I am implicated in this as well. I guess all I can say is I have a bit of advantage over the rest of you in that regard. The pattern is quite clear to me since I know I'm town and perhaps not so clear to the rest of you.<br><br>Not much of a defense but what else is there to say? I guess I don't see why I'd even bother with this whole thing if I were scum. I only had one vote on me beforehand so it's not like I needed to radically change my position in response to pressure or anything. I could've just sat on any random vote for a few days until we got a no lynch which is where we seem to be headed.<br><br>So why not Naomi? Well I did vote Naomi initially. Then everything with AJ happened and it became clear to me that he was protecting Flubber. Why not vote AJ then? Well partially because I think he's a more difficult lynch- start with the weakest link. If I can come to you guys tomorrow with a flipped scum in Flubber I think I've got a much better shot at bagging AJ. Secondly both he and culted are protecting Flubber - I think they're both scum but it's possible only one is. So go for the overlap in the Venn diagram of scumminess if you get what I mean."}

I just don't think it's possible for a scum player to play that way. Kairal is a relative newbie but has more posts than any other player in the game. He's spent a ridiculous amount of time trying to gamesolve, trying to figure out the scumteam and what possibilities work. AJ and others are using his inconsistencies as a reason to attack him.

If you look beyond the minutae and at the big picture, it's incredibly unlikely Kairal is scum here. <br><br>Let me know if you'd be willing to go with any of Culted, AJ, Flubber, and Dierfire and in what order you suspect each of them.

It's unspoken, but this suggests Shadow is scumreading Grey here.<br></li><li>His next real post is 670, which basically calls Io on her vote for me. By this time, I had called it, as had Kairal (255) and Dierfire (275). Granted, Shadow hadn't replaced in yes (replaces in p345) but the post (167) isn't so far in front of these to not see them, especially mine which came literally the next page. Even then, there has been a lot to happen up until 167 (specifically with CK slot, which he now reads from his conf-alignment view) and doesn't respond to any of it whatsoever. Either he's realized that it isn't particularly relevant for whatever reason (it still was as of 167) or he didn't respond to it for...??? <br></li><li>677 Shadow calls Grey scum. As of this post, his vote is still on MDS, but does not move the vote. He's still on his re-read since the respond is Grey's 375. Realizes two posts later Grey was playing a game here. Specifically I find this weird for a few reasons. I think naturally Shadow would unvote MDS IF HE BELIEVED THE LOGIC he uses in 677 (game got a lot easier w/mod confirmed shit). MDS shares alignment, right? Grey's scum complaining about free pass? Natural progression says that vote moves and then comes off in 681 when he reads through the entire sequence. <br></li><li>So in 683 we can assume Grey scumread is dropped. Replaces with Newman/Io scumreads. No reason given, votes Newman. Doesn't post at all during Io run up and eventual lynch. Votes off D2 with an IAI vote, who had L-1 on Io, his scum read. No explanation here, it's that awkward re-RVS stage that happened early D2. When called on it, it's the quoted post above (reaction test, no reads...). <br></li><li>There's a question put out to massive (p903) (why did he revote newman after claim) but no attempts to revote even after response. Just two irrelevant questions and then 8 IRL days inactivity, coming back with his first interaction with Kairal, asking if Shadow was next on the mislynch list. This:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8671964#p8671964\" class=\"postlink\">post 981</a>, Kairal wrote:</cite>I think the main thing I want right now is to see a bit more from Shadow.</div></blockquote><br><br>Is Kairal's part of the post that prompted Shadow saying: <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8673742#p8673742\" class=\"postlink\">post 983</a>, Shadow_step wrote:</cite>So it seems I'm your next ml target Kairal?<br>I'l get caught up during the weekend.<br>Meanwhile what is everyone's read on Kairal?</div></blockquote><br><br>It's a pretty severe overreaction. He hasn't mentioned Kairal at all before this post, and suddenly wants 'everyone's read on kairal' for suggesting (completely correctly) that we need to hear more from Shadow. Even considering the longass night 2, it had been just under 80 posts and Shadow at this point had little to no content. <br></li><li>1010 where he highlights the earliest parts of Grey's iso to apparently strike up something against me, even labeling it 'important posts from grey's iso' and then fails to commentate on it at all.

Shadow's overreaction to Kairal and then inability to push anything towards me even though his motives obviously suggest he's thinking about it. I'm slightly baffled by 1010 because I think it's so bad that I can't imagine someone actually trying that as either alignment. Literally the definition of throwing shade, since he wouldn't even VOTE off of it. <br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Shadow_step</span><br><br>I still want to know why you think this slot is town, because there's literally nothing in Shadow's iso to prove it. I'm also pretty sure he's still not caught up, because in one of his posts in the 800 range, he quoted a post from Jhin from the 370 range. This was D2, so he obviously had TIME to read through, but just opted not to. This game is one of the shortest games you could replace into and he didn't get through that.</div></blockquote><br><br>Pre-Massive claim. No need to rush out and bus a teammate early D3.

It... doesn't make a lot of sense to me why he'd do it this way. Here's the thing: One of the major reasons I've townread Kairal for so long is his reads have been fluid, have had natural progression and have made sense, even if they're a bit weak or somewhat waffled (kairal gets talked out of a lot of shit that he really shouldn't...). Especially since kairal wouldn't have a read jump on flubber if it were predetermined. Ergo read the rest of this post with kairal!scum as the control.<br><br>My biggest question is why does Kairal keep flubber's read scum after this? We know the two options: Bus, Mislynch. I think bus can make sense here but mislynch lends to a more advantageous scum motive. Kairal scumreads both me and Naomi. At this point, had he decided, he could've convinced massive/myself rather easily to buy into Naomi before Flubber. That scenario assumes Naomi is town to pass the lynch off in the first place. If Flubber was scum with Kairal, Kairal could attempt to drag him into lylo. Course... it doesn't do much, I think Kairal/Flubber would be the next two lynches. <br><br>It'd actually have been more natural for Kairal to continue a scum read of flubber from beginning to end in a hard bus. Be adamant about the lynch, gain the most town points. Doing this casts a ton of suspicion on Kairal. And really, removing Culted/IAI/Massive from her scumread list is a lot easier than going through this theatrical display. If Flubber was truly scum, this is a hard lynch to drop under any circumstance for a scum partner. Yet there are, as stated above, ways to do it. If he's town, Kairal could fumble on it, be insecure and not look super gung-ho on the lynch going into lylo for two lynches in a row that just look strange. <br><br>The drop of culted as a scum read in and of itself isn't awful. Well. Depends on your definition. Culted had been pressuring kairal pretty hard recently, and IaI, one of Kairal's other beginning scum reads, was/is pressing culted and it seems those two probably don't share an alignment. Had Kairal stated one of the two to be scum, it makes more sense. Picking a side that he believes is probably more useful to the town because it's an opinion and it's someone arguing for/against what's happening. Instead, from the looks of things, Kairal is seeing the entire thing as TvT. The piece of this that's important is culted had started to slip into the null area for a lot of people but IaI so it'd be pretty easy to bust out an easy town read. Is it possible to town read culted? Sure, but I think it's pertinent in 'reaccessing' reads to at least address IaI's point on that. In a way, this read change both follows Kairal's trend of being incredibly easy to persuade but also breaks the mold by not having really put a lot of consideration into it (as I'd argue the entire theory followed suit).<br><br> P-edit: Even with it being a response about culted's reads, it doesn't change the fact that culted has been completely dropped from Kairal's scum reads. <br><br>As far as I know, Naomi wasn't a strong scum read of Culted prior to this. I've mentioned this is odd that Kairal scumreads both Naomi and I (since we've done nothing but argue with me scumreading her, and my read on CK/Shadow/Naomi has been NAI to scum most of the game). Kairal amends it that he thinks it's TvS in 1467, but does little to explain why or who's the extra person. In fact, it's another written-in mislynch that he ADMITS to. A day away from Lylo he's giving himself a mislynch chance on a 50/50. Let's go back to Flubber being innocent for a moment. IF flubber is innocent, LYLO occurs tomorrow and scum have 3 of the 4 remaining. More than likely, they'd take that bet at a 50/50 between Naomi and I and pull ahead. Hell, they'd only need one person to vote me and then win it, so it's not really a 50/50. <br><br>More importantly, Kairal's done zilch for scumreading me all game and only started scumreading Naomi for the short period of time when Shadow came after her to naomi's replace in. And we're to believe off this method he's got a scumread strong enough to believe it on not even full VCA.  <br><br>If I had to guess, Kairal's indication shows Culted scum, Naomi scum, himself scum. Naomi is biased on my own read of her but unless I'm going to read Dierfire as scum, who's basically unmentioned and a consistent town read of mine, there's not a lot that makes sense from this perspective. Flubber could be scum here and it could just be a poorly executed bus/someone that scum has determined to not live through lylo either. The one flaw is Shadow did toss some shade at Kairal, which doesn't make a hell of a lot of sense, though it wasn't followed by a case nor vote so it was just shade. But between this, the Jin incident and some inconsistencies we've seen from Kairal today, I think this is it. <br><br>Culted/Kairal/Naomi|Flubber. <br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Kairal</span><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Kairal wrote:</cite>Ultimately though regardless of the method I've landed exactly on who Aj and Naomi claim is their top scum read.

We know now that culted was scum so this is a pretty large red flag.<br><br>3)\tMy voting analysis indicated that AJ and Flubber were very likely scum partners- they were consistently opposed on most votes and major arguments<br><br>4)\tWhen AJ saw this argument he refused to vote for Flubber (despite ostensibly scum reading him) instead moving his vote to me- more protection for Flubber from a confirmed scum<br><br>5)\tHaving been caught out by never agreeing the most likely course of action for a scum team is to throw off the pattern by immediately breaking it- in this case that means all voting for the same person.

In the 15 days we had to choose a vote target and justify it Flubber decided on me with one line.<br><br>7)\tDay 3 got very close to a no lynch. 6 players made sure they were available during the last few days before deadline in order to ensure a lynch. Flubber and the two confirmed scum were all absent because they didn\u2019t need a lynch<br><br>8)\tIo, BV and I all called Flubber as the most likely partner on a scum team with AJ and culted and we did so before there were any flips. I can\u2019t prove that I\u2019m town but the other two are confirmed at least.<br><br>9)\tI mentioned before that once a pattern is pointed out scum will try to change it up. On Day 4 both culted and Flubber vote for each other in their first posts \u2013 a clear reaction to culted being caught out for protecting Flubber on Day 3."}

I do think AJ has a point in that 2 cops and a JK are all pretty much confirmable roles that are not going to get lynched. Add to that, in most situations, there will at least be a couple of results or a missing nk and you have a heavily townsided game. I know I'd be frustrated with the balance if I were scum here. Personally my experience here so far has been that mods on mafiascum way underestimate how powerful town roles can be and often make setups far too townsided. But that's just me. I honestly think even a 10:3 all-vanilla game with normal nightkills is winnable if the town is competent enough.<br><br>I do think town deserved to win this one though given how many of us accurately nailed the entire scumteam. Io was brilliant D1 and me, Kairal and IAI had it figured out D3.

When you have a backup mod, you should be adding him to a mod PT and giving him all the info about the game so that he can actually process flips and night actions. I even made a post asking you to give him that info. Frequency of VCs should have been much higher. Eventually we winded up making our own VCs. OP should be up to date. For most of the game, it was about two days behind. I didn't even know what day we were in when I replaced into the game and thought it was D2 since SAJ's and Grey's flip weren't there. Adding the day of the game to the title would have been very helpful. Links to the beginning and end of each day in the OP would have been fantastic. Immediately adding people to a dead/spectator PT would be cool. I only got the link the following night after I got killed along with massive. Just make sure, next time you mod a game, you have enough free time to stay on top of the game and keep everything updated. For an example of a well-modded game, look at even mhsmith's or podoboq's games.<br><br>As far as the Cloudkicker situation is concerned, I think you made a rather subjective decision by force-replacing him. If you really thought he was playing against wincon, you should have modkilled him. Force-replacing really left a lot of people trying to outguess the mod. Eventually I don't think it mattered much since an investigation was wasted on my slot anyways so it didn't make a difference."}

As I explained in the dead PT, I would've loved to have a roleblocker and target out grey night 1. Then what? Newman lives, he has no claims, he either LIES or undergoes some serious suspicion again.

I saw that we had almost no way to win EVEN WITH a perfect game to that point. Flubber dying lost us the game eventually, regardless. MDS clear, another forced kill on massive when he can cop again, and the suspicion that stems that Naomi/CK/S_S share MDS' alignment is really hard to deal with. As I stated in that dead thread, my gambit was to try and win it in a very heavy wifom LYLO. I knew it was 1 for 1 and I don't think culted/Flubber were able to read what I was doing (hey, we ALSO don't get day talk. Which seriously would've been lovely to help flubber out much earlier). Kairal was right to call the attacks, but not right to stick to the analysis. In fact, I'm not sure you really gained much from it.<br><br>Talk to Titus in the future if you want to continue with VCA. I'm pretty sure they look for WHEN people vote than anything else. With scum flips, I know VCA starts to look at WHO voted for scum in meaningful situations, who was easily swayed when it got close to meaningful or if they can find a group vote involving that scum. I'm sure I could've survived probably into D6/7 had I not engaged you there but the issue was that the pieces would've eventually fallen into place to incriminate me in an extended game."}
