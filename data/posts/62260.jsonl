PM me if you have any concerns about a players' actions.<br>\n5) All text must be readily readable, in legible script, and fully visible. No encrypted or otherwise coded text.<br>\n6) I call the shots, but if you feel I make a mistake or have a question - PM me or bold @mod in thread.<br>\n7) Do not quote any PM sent by me to you that regards this game. Paraphrasing is fine.<br>\n9) I prod every 48 hours. I give you 24 hours to respond, or I give you a hard-prod (Another prod basically), to which you have 12 hours to respond or I will begin searching for a replacement. If you return before I find a replacement, you'll be fine. Otherwise, you're gone when I say you are. If you need some time, V/LA or PM me and say so, I can make an exception for a little while longer.<br>\n10) <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF4000\">Bold Orange</div></div> is my color as moderator. Don't even think about pretending to be me. Not even jokingly.<br>\n11) Vote by using either the 'bold' or 'vote' tags. Please be clear about the player (nicknames are okay if they are close enough). If I don't understand you, I won't count the vote. If I think you're making a vote, I will count it.<br>\n12) Lynches happen when &gt;50% of the votes are on a player. You may discuss until I close the thread.<br>\n13) Day phases are 2 weeks, night phases are 48 hours -or- when I have all night actions.<br>\n14) My final rule is this: Don't be a jerk. That's not to say you can't play aggressively, but do no personally insult someone, someone's family, or use excessive/racist comments. I have 0 tolerance for such things, and it -will- earn you a modkill.</fieldset>", "time": "Thu Jun 18, 2015 6:54 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=62260&start=0", "forum": "53", "thread": "62260"}

You have a serious vote on Zakk. What didn't you like about his attitude? Also, \"his posts are lacking\" seems vague to me. I mean, if you look my posts, I don't think I'd said much really at that point either. You didn't feel the need to vote me? Or pressure me? Look at Mahonster, who is still in RVS apparently.

Those posts you quoted of mine are not uncertain at all. I really don't like how you are most suspicious of zakk but are joining the Aero wagon because it's bigger despite saying you haven't had a problem with an Aero post for awhile now. Also, if zakk is the most likely to be scum to you, jumping off his wagon is super scummy, especially since you are basically agreeing with your biggest scumread that Aero is scum via your jump onto the Aero wagon that zakk is also on. And sheeping others reads this early is bad because clearly you aren't paying attention to the person you are sheeping to see if they are a town or scumread to you. I'd rather you explained your reads and also pushed your major scumreads which is what I'd expect town to do. <br>\n<br>\nI don't have super strong reads yet. dragon leans slightly town based on meta because his L-1 push and fake hammer is a lot more aggressive than I've seen him play as scum. zakk leans town VT right now due to the speed of his wagon and his play so far, that's about it until other people post a lot more.<br>\n<br>\nAnother thing that is kind of a red flag to me is pisskop forcing a claim this early but I've seen this kind of play from town enough times, unfortunately, that I'm not ready to scumread him based on that alone.", "time": "Sat Jun 20, 2015 1:45 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=62260&start=175", "forum": "53", "thread": "62260"}

Also, if zakk is the most likely to be scum to you, jumping off his wagon is super scummy, especially since you are basically agreeing with your biggest scumread that Aero is scum via your jump onto the Aero wagon that zakk is also on.

If you must have an explanation, I do say things to people and ask certain questions and wait to elaborate on why until they answer all the time. Why would I tell someone how to answer when that defeats the purpose of asking the question in the first place? I also can't stand when someone jumps in and answers for someone in this situation either. It completely defeats the purpose of what I'm trying to do. Aero was telling zakk it's what scum say when they don't have an answer. I was saying I've done it as town before, therefore disagreeing with him that it's a scum tactic. The I don't know, was me disagreeing with Aero. There is nothing uncertain about it at all.

I strive for any lynch; I think it is more likely that others' reads and suspicions are right than my own are, so this is how I'm going to play this game.

But the initial question posed by SilverWolf presents it as an either/or, with one positive option and one negative option. It is manipulative, and any way Mahonster answer paints him in a bad light. If it's a serious vote, Mahonster then has to explain his reasoning, and the lack of reasoning from the get-go is going to raise suspicion. Claiming the second, of course, looks negative as many players in this game would say blatantly keeping the game in RVS is not a town thing to do. And a middling answer feels non-commital and weak.

But the initial question posed by SilverWolf presents it as an either/or, with one positive option and one negative option. It is manipulative, and any way Mahonster answer paints him in a bad light. If it's a serious vote, Mahonster then has to explain his reasoning, and the lack of reasoning from the get-go is going to raise suspicion. Claiming the second, of course, looks negative as many players in this game would say blatantly keeping the game in RVS is not a town thing to do. And a middling answer feels non-commital and weak. SilverWolf's question trapped Mahonster in a situation to which there are no completely reasonable explanations or positive outcomes.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nNo it did not because he said it was RVS but he was ready to get serious. So, I concluded that he wasn't trying to keep us in RVS. So no, any answer he gave did not put him in a bad light since his answer was fine.<br>\n<br>\nAgain, you are nitpicking word choice and assigning untrue motives to what I was trying to do.

I'm going through and trying to get reads or ask questions of people to get things going but it just seems like I've hit a wall here. It's been a busy holiday weekend and I've taken that into account but it seems like most who were active on D1 are not on D2 and many are not very active at all and some don't post anything of content when they do post and/or don't post very frequently. I'm not sure if it is because the SK flip happened first and there was no NK so there isn't much to analyze or if there isn't someone as suspicious as Chevre was or what but the complete lack of engagement is not good.

I mean, back on last Wednesday when Chev made his fake claim, Silver made her post (273) that looked like a soft Vig claim, which Dragon commented on and Aero also noticed, quoted, and commented on at the time (his 298) but Aero kept trying for two full days to keep Chev alive and then in his post 386 on Friday, he said he 'noticed something' and switched to Chev - but he had noticed and commented on it two days earlier.

It isn't like he was a scumbuddy to Chev, of course, since Chev was an SK, but I can't make sense of the sequence of events or the pretense about not noticing Silver's post two days earlier.<br>\n<br>\nAs noted above, I am hoping to be able to read everyone in ISO prehaps tomorrow evening, but I am happy to answer any questions that anyone may have in the interim.<br>\n<br>\nRegards,<br>\nJazz", "time": "Sun Jul 05, 2015 4:27 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=62260&start=675", "forum": "53", "thread": "62260"}

Same with zakk tbtbh, if you thought he was scum I don't really get why you jumped off instead of trying to make a case on him since he has so many votes</div></blockquote>You're not voting for chevre here.<br>\nHave some scumpoints.<br>\n<br>\nBilli bringing chevre to L-1 is once again friggin' gutsy as heck.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>zakk wrote:</cite>Saw the claim. I say we leave Chevre alive and let him take out someone suspicious tonight.<br>\nI didn't spot the crumb, but there was something about saying inconsistency was scummy, and then doing exactly that in the same post, which has me thinking that he's more likely to be town regardless of poor play. Then again, I don't know much about Chevre, except for seeing that he runs the popularity games in Speakeasy forum, which I would assume requires massive attention to detail, and a very logical and disciplined mind.<br>\n<br>\nSomebody unvote Chevre please before scum lolderphammers and makes a stupid excuse about how they weren't paying attention or didn't believe him. This situation bears more discussion.</div></blockquote>I feel like zakk could be scum trying to get on Chevre's good side to avoid being potentially shot and trying get some townpoints for trying to pull apart a wagon on him. Something about this feels sleazy and I'm gonna take a look at zakk's ISO to make sure this isn't some fuckery.<br>\n****He did kind of waffle on this read earlier and say that he didn't want to lynch chevre prior to the claim so this doesn't seem like it's necessarily coming from a completely bullshit place. I feel like I would expect this kind of reaction from someone new vs someone who's been around since 2013 though.<br>\n********<blockquote><div><cite>zakk wrote:</cite>This is one of my first games out of the Newbie forum and I was playing the same way I did in there, which was aggressive and unafraid and I got treated entirely differently. And now I'm kind of scared to post in this game and give opinions and stuff because I'm not friends with that many people here yet and people would rather lynch someone they don't know, and don't know how to read. It's lazy but it's understandable. And me attempting to \"teach people a lesson\" by insisting on using a particular play style and showing people \"ha, you were wrong, I'm town\" really serves no purpose. Scum laughs and moves on, town hates me more, and moves on too. And that's no fun for me OR my team.</div></blockquote>Oh.<br>\nWell. I have no idea what to think about you anymore. :/<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Shiro wrote:</cite>Eh I generally don't vote much especially early on. </div></blockquote>Trying to decide whether Shiro is careful cautious scum or careful cautious townie.<br>\nMight need to metadive to feel good about a decision.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>davesaz wrote:</cite>Shiro and Aeronaut can be town if Chevre flips town.</div></blockquote>Uh. Why?<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>zakk wrote:</cite>Wow<br>\n<br>\nLurking isn't scum. Town is going to lose this game if all you do is lynch lurkers. It's been part of a game day, untangle your priorities and develop reads on other people in the game too.</div></blockquote>If zakk is scum then he's really likely to have at least one lurker scumbuddy.<br>\n<br>\nQuaroth jumping off the chevre wagon looks less awful in the context of block's last post. Reads less as nervous reaction and more as a reaction to block's lack of content which is pretty shrugs.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Aeronaut wrote:</cite>This seems like a lot more \"Oh, I'm overwhelmed, I'm just out of the newbie queue etc. etc.\". While it's true you haven't played much besides games in the queue, I feel like you're trying to make it sound like this is your second game ever or something, which is not true. You've played like 7 or 8 games there, and while it's not quite the same, that's still experience.<br>\n<br>\nNot to mention most of your posting lately has been about struggling with this game. It's also not your posting style, there's nothing wrong with being agressive. It's mainly that you were trying your hardest to LOOK aggressive, which is really only a think scum has to do, in my opinion. </div></blockquote>I feel like you're trying too hard to make zakk look like scum here, especially in the context of what he's trying to say. I think his play makes a lot of sense knowing that he doesn't have like any experience outside of the newbie queue.<br>\nI just don't get the feeling that you're actually trying to sort through zakk here, even with the question that I'm leaving out for the sake of space. I feel like you're pushing things that you know can come across as acceptable for scumreading people rather than actually trying to read him and figure out whether he's scum.<br>\n<br>\nAnd then Aero realizes something? Will need to follow up on that.<br>\n<br>\nI don't like pisskop's hammer. It feels too calculated. Like, him establishing all of that shit before he actually puts down the hammer feels showy and like he needs to justify the hammer before it happens so he doesn't look like shit post-flip.<br>\n<br>\n--------------------------------------------------------<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">No kill things!</div>:<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>dragon wrote:</cite>I'm speculating that either aero or pisskop are scum.

That looks like something that will take me longer than just the available time I have this evening, so I thought what I would do is start my ISO reads of the players who struck me as most scummy during my initial readthrough and post them up as I complete them rather than waiting until I finish all of the ISO reads.  I tend to prefer to do all of my reads before posting my conclusions because that saves me from having to go back and correct, change or retract stuff later after I've completed a particular ISO read when I (inevitably) missed or misinterpreted some stuff in my initial readthrough, but it occurs to me that doing it this way might be just as good and will break up what might otherwise become either walls of text or a whole bunch of posts in a row.  <br>\n<br>\nSo, starting with zakk, since he's the one I have the strongest scum read on.<br>\n<br>\n- Contradictory:  in #55 he said that he is quite experienced at Mafia, having played &#8220;a number of games here, and also a ton in real life and on other sites&#8221; but more recently he&#8217;s been playing the &#8220;poor me, newbie card&#8221;. <br>\n<br>\n- I don&#8217;t buy his responses to the &#8216;fake hammer&#8217; bit.  He clearly knew that he had 4 votes on him because he was actively posting at the time and responded to them in the thread; then he saw 2 more votes, which put him at L-1, because he posted twice in response then as well, once to claim VT and say that it was preposterous and again to ask people to unvote, etc.  But then a couple of hours later, he posted, &#8220;Oh, am I not actually at L-1? LOL.&#8221;  Then, after the fake &#8220;lynch&#8221; vote, he said that he knew it wasn&#8217;t really a lynch because he knew that Dragon was on his wagon.  This indicates his awareness of not only how many votes he had, but also who the voters were, which is inconsistent with his later claim to have not known he was at L-1 when he was.   Not the biggest deal on the planet, of course, but his posts struck me as false when I read them, and there is no reason for a VT to fib like that.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n- Wanting to keep Chev alive even though Chev was scummy and even though zakk had by then put Silver as &#8220;one of his strongest&#8221; town reads&#8221; (247), and even though zakk noticed the soft vig claim by Silver suggesting that Chev was lying about his vig claim, which ought to have led to suspicion in his mind as to the veracity of Chev&#8217;s claim; this suggests to me scum who didn't believe the vig claim but wanted an SK around to help kill townies for a while.<br>\n<br>\n- Contradictory:  looking at his D1 posts in which he said he is so excited to play, that he&#8217;s really really town, etc., things changed later in the day and he started saying that he&#8217;s going to read the thread and make a real post but hasn&#8217;t had time, then continues not to do so, and then even when he had the opportunity over a twilight/night period that lasted nearly four days, he says he didn&#8217;t bother because he didn&#8217;t want to put in the effort if he was going to be NK&#8217;d.   This doesn&#8217;t really make sense to me because with the amount of suspicion on him on D1, it was highly unlikely that, if he were town, he would be targeted for NKing by scum, and it doesn&#8217;t line up with his previous posts.  When the new day started on June 30, he said he was half way through, but he does not seem to have contributed much since then beyond saying that he&#8217;ll say more later.<br>\n<br>\n- On preview, I just saw his latest post (764) in which he is back to asking Pis what Pis thought he was hinting at way on page 2, even though when he did this the first time (after casting a vote without reasons at the time but saying he would give his reasons later, which he still has not done), it looked like he was trying to get someone else to say something for him to use to try to justify his vote.  <br>\n<br>\nNext up, Mahon.

The first part was a huge red flag to me on zakk. Why is he working so hard to save Chevre? Considering he even pointed out in one of his posts that Chevre could be the SK. I thought he was trying to get towncred for protecting a claimed PR which is something I can totally see coming from scum. BUT, I never even considered he might actually want the SK around because I was always under the impression that scum hate SK's and want them dead. Plus, Chevre had zakk and myself as scumreads so there was a chance Chevre could of shot zakk although I was pretty sure he would of killed me and that's why I wanted him dead. <br>\n<br>\nThe second paragraph perfectly describes my biggest problem with zakk. He is assuming he'll be killed at night which is super ridiculous. Scum aren't going to shoot at a claimed VT who has heavy suspicion on him. That explanation doesn't hold water. He's making excuses and it's scummy. <br>\n<br>\nSo far, this post and others like it, will help me a lot figuring out Jazzmyn. But I do like the train of though so far.", "time": "Mon Jul 06, 2015 4:37 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=62260&start=750", "forum": "53", "thread": "62260"}

Aero, I'm going to look into more today because I have this thing where if I get real wishy washy on my reads and can't figure out scum, it's usually because I am townreading one of them. In Delicious (mini Aero modded) I had all the scum pegged at certain points in the game and ended up chasing after lurkers and bad town and letting the scum go. I think my townread on Aero is because he was in our townblock D1-you, me, Aero, pisskop and it seemed appropriate at the time. He was acting townie. His Chevre push and switch looked more like town trying to figure out alignments rather than scum trying to kill the SK. But I do want to look into him more and make sure my townread on him is appropriate.

I do not understand how Mahon could view Chev as deliberately attempting to manipulate players in order to make them view others as scummy while simultaneously reading Chev as town.    And the repetition of \"honestly\", \"naturally\", and \"truthfully\" in a single post sets my scumdar on edge.

As I mentioned previously, I think that scum do have a motivation to keep a D1 suspected SK alive for a little while in order to help kill townies (when the risk of the SK hitting scum is relatively low).   Later on Day 2, Mahon still has no scum reads (537) but assures us that once he does, he will jump right on them like Brits on tea.<br>\n<br>\n- Another hundred posts go by and then Mahon says (642) that he is &#8220;not giving away&#8221; his reads because he wants to &#8220;wait before he makes a case&#8221; and that if he makes a weak case now &#8220;they may correct themselves of any flaws and continue on hiding better&#8221;.

Billi<br>\n<br>\n---------------------------------------------------------<br>\n<br>\n-Shiro's vote on zakk was RVS and later unvoted-insignificant but I don't like that there's been no voting from Shiro since.<br>\n<br>\n-Blockymann's vote on zakk is nothing but he's suspicious, get him out-I like Cheetory's play so far, but I have mixed feelings about his pisskop push-part of me wants to say it's genuine and part of me wants to say he saw a PR claim and went for the throat<br>\n<br>\n-I'm not analyzing pisskop's or dragonspawn's votes because unless they are playing a super risky and bad scumgame, they are both town, they are both good enough players not to ruin their team's chance with bad plays<br>\n<br>\n-Quaroath RVS votes mahonster<br>\n<br>\n-grimmjow says zakk needs to die with fire-unexplained-later explains it in an o.k. way, was an non-entity all game and Jazzmyn, while understandably busy, had mostly been doing catch-up types of posts and reads which make it hard to get a good read on this slot, grimmjow votes for Chevre with fairly good reasoning, not so sure why he put zakk to town when asked about his vote-seems odd<br>\n<br>\n-Billi puts him to L-1-Billi is a moderate townread so I'm not really all that bothered by this unless he starts looking scummy and he hasn't yet<br>\n<br>\n-Quaroath votes for Chevre after dragon and myself do but it's really hard not to vote for him at this point so that's o.k. <br>\n<br>\n-dave votes for Chevre here-mostly just says he looks scummy and sheeped my reasoning<br>\n<br>\n-Billi votes for Chevre with fine reasoning<br>\n<br>\n-I really don't like zakk's striving so hard to keep Chevre alive here, it looks fake<br>\n<br>\n-I like Quaroath's response to my response to Chevre's claim and his jump to Blocky seems to have good reasoning<br>\n<br>\n-Aero's putting Chevre to L-1 looks to come from a town motivated perspective, could be scum but I think he's trying to resolve alignments and that's more town than scum<br>\n<br>\n-Quaroath revotes Blocky at start of D2 with no reasoning but I get why he had a problem with Blocky as I did too<br>\n<br>\n-zakk's play diminishes a lot and he ticks me off most of D2 but it's probably bad town, although he should be lynched before lylo I believe<br>\n<br>\n-Quaroath votes Grimm with no reasoning, saying he's confused, later explains himself well<br>\n<br>\n-I hate mahonster's reasoning for having zero scumreads<br>\n<br>\n-Cheet replaces in, votes Quaroath, reasoning is fine but weird that he later rescinds this<br>\n<br>\n-Quaroath's unvote is fine because Cheet is now posting and he was voting Blocky for being worthless<br>\n<br>\n-dave's anger here is not justified after a couple votes, it seems out of place <br>\n<br>\n-Billi starts his reads and I really like them<br>\n<br>\n-mahonster's vote for dave over the anger is so-so, meh<br>\n<br>\n-Quaroath votes mahonster for being too neutral-I'm good with this vote<br>\n<br>\n-Aero votes mahonster for the same reasoning<br>\n<br>\n-Quaroath answers my buddy allegations well<br>\n<br>\n-Jazzmyn's catch ups are fine but without engaging the game, I can't read this slot well, however I'm a sucker for well thought out posts with total transparency of thought process and usually attribute those to town but I've been screwed over doing that in the past so meh<br>\n<br>\n-I actually like mahonster's <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7027664#p7027664\">680</a><br>\n<br>\n-Aero's posts here are pretty good<br>\n<br>\n-zakk's asking me if I'm scum over and over is just so much troll-if I was scum dragon, pisskop, and maybe even Aero and Cheetory would of already hung me, we just got out of 2 games where I was scum, I don't know what the hell I'm gonna do if I draw scum in a game with them again in the recent future, especially since I'm so transparently town in this one-bleh<br>\n<br>\n-I don't like dave's reasoning for his vote on pisskop-too wishy washy<br>\n<br>\n-mahonster's vote on Quaroath is meh<br>\n<br>\n-I actually like Quaroath's reaction to the why is pisskop town deal with mahonster-Quaroath wins over mahonster here<br>\n<br>\n-zakk's vote on pisskop is crap because the reasoning is shitty and makes no sense<br>\n<br>\n-the whole pisskop vs dragon thing makes me think dave is scummy because he's always trying to cast it in the worst light-like saying I could be a godfather and pisskop is my team mate, saying rolestopper makes no sense as a town role-I disagree with this BTW<br>\n<br>\n-Cheetory's push on pisskop actually looks town motivated on re-read<br>\n<br>\n-Shiro is just too darn null for me, the lack of voting is hurting my read there although <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7038368#p7038368\">1078</a> is pretty good<br>\n<br>\n-every time dave posts I want to lynch him

I mean, by the time I get through individual reads, there are several more pages of fresh material so then when I post, there is indeed a 'disconnect' of sorts.  So, I think I'm going to alter my original approach and instead skip forward to getting my notes caught up on the most recent (RL) days and jump in with current stuff, and then go back and add in the rest of my catch up stuff as and when I can during periods when I have extra hours to devote to the game.   That way, I think I will be able to post much more spontaneously instead of slogging through the older stuff constantly, and then remaining constantly behind on the newer stuff, and I think maybe that will also help others to get their reads on me.   I think I'm doing okay for being only 5 days into a game that's been going on for nearly a month but if the other way is making it difficult for people to get their reads on me, I am happy to adapt to a different approach.  <br>\n<br>\nRegards,<br>\nJazz", "time": "Thu Jul 09, 2015 2:07 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=62260&start=1150", "forum": "53", "thread": "62260"}

My motivation behind questioning was not to out but to see if Quaroath had legitimate reasons for copying SW on the pisskop townread.

It seems to me that most people would be naturally skeptical of the claims coming out the way that they did, so I don't think there is anything suspicious about people questioning the claims, at least not up until the point where the moderator chimed in because in this case, it was a moderator error that caused the claims to come out as they did and the moderator has confirmed that he made an error in not registering pis' action on N1.   <br>\n<br>\nThat does not mean that pis (or dragon) is 100% mod-confirmed town, but given how the whole thing played out, and given that they could not possibly have known in advance that the moderator would err on the N1 actions, I cannot even fathom that they could have somehow contrived this whole thing as scum, so that's close enough to mod-confirmed town for me.

I mean, by the time I get through individual reads, there are several more pages of fresh material so then when I post, there is indeed a 'disconnect' of sorts.  So, I think I'm going to alter my original approach and instead skip forward to getting my notes caught up on the most recent (RL) days and jump in with current stuff, and then go back and add in the rest of my catch up stuff as and when I can during periods when I have extra hours to devote to the game.   That way, I think I will be able to post much more spontaneously instead of slogging through the older stuff constantly, and then remaining constantly behind on the newer stuff, and I think maybe that will also help others to get their reads on me.   I think I'm doing okay for being only 5 days into a game that's been going on for nearly a month but if the other way is making it difficult for people to get their reads on me, I am happy to adapt to a different approach.  <br>\n<br>\nRegards,<br>\nJazz</div></blockquote><br>\nI'm gonna do this too.

Mod errors happen. No one's alignment was given away. No rules were broken. The game isn't broken and either alignment can still win. While there is a strong townbloc now which is helpful for town, scum also has a lot more info. than they had which is helpful for them so it's a wash. <br>\n<br>\nWhat makes me mad about you zakk, is the fact that you said you weren't posting because you actually thought we'd gang up on you and lynch you because we don't know you as well. Not only is that a shit attitude for a town VT to take, there is zero reason to believe that would happen based on this game so far. Mahonster is not being voted because we don't know him well. I highly suggest you read the game and follow along and if you can't do that, then replace out. I have a very hostile attitude towards lurkers, people who make excuses and don't provide content, or really bad play like naked votes, no explanations for reads, or excessive trolling. I mean as scum, whatever, but as town this is something I don't like much. <br>\n<br>\nOutside the newbie queue, this kind of play makes me want to make sure you don't make it to lylo. <br>\n<br>\nNow, I kind of agree that mahonster is acting more townie in his latest posts. Notice I'm not voting for him right now. However, I will because we need a lynch today and up until recently, he hasn't really looked town to me.<br>\n<br>\nIt is really very simple:<br>\n<br>\n-pisskop is a rolestopper that rolestopped me N1-this means I'm protected from all night actions including kills but can still perform night actions if I have any<br>\n<br>\n-dragon is a BP cop who was shot N1 and informed of it, he copped me N1 and got a town result<br>\n<br>\n-the conflict happened because Oz forgot to register pisskop's night action and let dragon's go through, so when they 1v1'd, dragon thought pisskop was lying about rolestopping me because he was able to get a result on me and shouldn't have, pisskop thought dragon was lying because he rolestopped me and dragon shouldn't have gotten a result on me at all<br>\n<br>\n-because Oz let dragon's result go through, he had to say something because otherwise pisskop and then dragon most likely would of been lynched and that would of severely undermined the integrity of the game because it would of been due to that one mistake by Oz and town would of been put at a huge disadvantage<br>\n<br>\nNow that should be enough of a re-cap. pisskop, dragon, and myself are town. Period. <br>\n<br>\nIf you think mahonster is town, and you are town, your best bet is to put up some good reads and do some scumhunting which is something I haven't seen from you at all since D2 started.<br>\n<br>\nAlso, if one more person says this game is going too fast, I'm gonna be pissed. It's pretty much at the same level as another mini in D2 and there's another mini at 80 plus pages and another one at 90 plus. Not only that but we have a few players who are very inactive and some days where not much at all was going on in this game.<br>\n<br>\nAlso, I wall a lot as either alignment and if one person complains about walls, they can go take a flying leap.", "time": "Thu Jul 09, 2015 8:09 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=62260&start=1175", "forum": "53", "thread": "62260"}

The fact is that he used a rolestop ability. Everything else that has come out of my blunder, such as speculation about the other players involved (the person who the shot was used on, the ones who claim to use their abilities on someone, etc.), is just that: speculation. So yes, the mistake on my end was bad.

The fact is that he used a rolestop ability. Everything else that has come out of my blunder, such as speculation about the other players involved (the person who the shot was used on, the ones who claim to use their abilities on someone, etc.), is just that: speculation.

Dragon could potentially invest Quaroath to avoid another misguided mislynch by me here, but that's up to dragon. If Quaroath flips scum, go and look at everything he's done. I've posted in the past that I think he could be in partnership with Aero, so look at the relationship there. Notice that his reads on the last page are practically the same - potential partnerships are Aero Shiro Dave and (a little less likely) Jazzy.<br>\n<br>\nI don't know why zakk buddied me, perhaps because we're both noobs or something. I think he's just lynch bait now. Scum (like Quaroath who wants zakk lynched more but is still voting me) will go for his slot tomorrow. It's still possible zakk could be scum and just defending me for when I flip VT, but doubt.<br>\n<br>\nI'm assuming Quaroath is scum here for this next part.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Second, lynch Aero</div>. People are unsure here so better Just Do It (Nike product placement). I don't like Aero's play this game (notice how he's up for zakk's lynch), and I don't think that Cheetory is scum.<br>\n<br>\nAnd next, I can't help you with that. Play the game carefully, listen to others minimally. Don't base your votes on the walls of text the scum write, make something for yourself and have your own opinions. <br>\n<br>\nFinal random notes:<br>\n<br>\n<ul><li>-If anybody ever suggests that the town block is indeed not town in a couple of days, lynch the shit out of them.<br>\n-Shiro is in a really easy and nice place for my lynch right now, nobody questioned that.<br>\n-Screw Quaroath. That last wall of text was a whole bunch of empty text, no content.<br>\n-I don't like dave either. Put him somewhere on a check later list.<br>\n-glhf please win town.</li></ul><br>\n<br>\n<br>\nOh, also.

All townies in this game are still alive. Even if he was a mislynch, it isn't going to lose us the game by any means. I think he's made a couple townie looking posts but the reason he got voted in the first place was his unwillingness to share reads and seeming fearfulness of getting involved in any serious discussion where he would be questioned. He just made excuses and only starting posting content when pressured. Plus this secret, you guys will have to not lynch me to figure out how I'm going to help you is BS.

I went back to being IV-hydrated, put on steroids for swelling, and some other medications to clear my throat. Now that I'm fully hydrated again and swallowing fine, I should be okay.

Probably replaced out of the more difficult one.<br>\n<br>\nCheetory comes in strong creating a distance to his known partner, Quaroath. Both for us, and maybe especially for his neighbor partner, Mahonster, so that he wouldn't be grilled about his Quaroath stance when the neighboring partnership would come up. Cheetory then lets this slide so that Quaroath doesn't have too much pressure.<br>\n<br>\nCheetory regularly comments about how strong the mafia is, that there can't be a GF because then it would be way to strong (I see Titus is on the same page there), while I noticed that Shiro (who I also believe is experienced here) has the opposite view, that the mafia is rather weak. So, what I'm pointing at here, is the difference between two players, how they are evaluating the balance in the game, and one of them now dead townie and therefor truthful.<br>\n<br>\nCheetory kills Mahonster, his neighbor partner, and therefor he can control what is said about the neighbor thread, f.ex. that Maho was starting to suspect me more than him. I could not get the vibe from Maho that he was at any time more sure about one or the other of us two.<br>\nHe also kills the player that he doesn't know as well as you, Aero, and dragon. He must believe that he can manipulate his friends (from older games) better than a new player that also has a secondary view of him through the neighbor thread.<br>\n<br>\nCheetory spends the last part of the game to try to finish the game with quick-lynches. I believe that he was sincere in his background reasons of personal interferences, and that would effect that he wanted to finish quickly.

He says he doesn't want to be perfect to minimize suspicion on him. Playing to have some suspicion deliberately is fine if you're a PR, but he isn't. Second, playing as town means that you don't give a fuck regarding suspicion, not that you try to draw it. Most of BB's posts are theory and semantic crafting, no real substance intent on drawing out alignments. There's a distinct lack of followthrough for most of this ISO. #518 is information over analysis. It's too early by that point to do any legit analysis based on reads. There's no flips. #611 is another summary, IIoA post. There's no \"strong\" reads for the most part. It's all \"weak\" and \"null\".<br>\n<br>\nHis vote on Quaroth is unclear. He doesn't really push it there. It's safe because it's one of the two scumreads he has, but he can retract his vote at anytime. He does when the Zakk wagon takes off because Zakk is his other scumread, yet his IIoA implies he has other reads. 1358 is the closest to follow through. He feels that Quaroth never answered his vote question, yet there's no emotion no nothing. This looks like an easy softball designed to get Quaorth talking. He never really follows up on this scumread and has his vote elsewhere when daveaz is lynched.<br>\n<br>\nHis ISO shows no hunting. No questions designed to get scum. Only recapping where everyone's reads are which is excellent if you're setting up endgame scenarios.", "time": "Thu Aug 06, 2015 5:03 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=62260&start=1725", "forum": "53", "thread": "62260"}
