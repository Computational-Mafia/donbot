Depending on the circumstance, you may be able to paraphrase things I have sent you (such as a role PM). Use common sense and if you are unsure feel free to ask me via PM.<br>\n<br>\n4) Be courteous to your fellow player. This is just a game - please don't bring personal grudges into the game. Try and keep it civil. If you cross 'the line' I'll step in. Said line will be judged by me.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">&gt; Voting, Lynching &amp; Death </div><br>\n<br>\n5) For your vote to be counted, it must be bold, and in the form <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: Voidedmafia</div>. Caps and colons are optional, but it does need to be bolded. The vote tags are also appropriate for voting.<br>\n<br>\n5a) Broken bold tags won't count. Mispellings or shortened names are ok as long as it is clear who you are voting. If I can't tell who you're voting, it won't count. <br>\n<br>\n5c) VOTES MUST BE ON A COMPLETELY SEPARATE LINE FROM ANY OTHER TEXT! Any votes that are NOT on a separate line WILL NOT BE COUNTED EVER, and I will NOT be flexible on this. You either have it on it's own line, or suck it up.<br>\n<br>\n6) Unvotes aren't necessary before placing a new vote. However, unvotes are necessary if you want to completely remove your vote. Please bold your unvotes or use the unvote tags. It is not necessary to name the player you are unvoting, except in instances where you may have more than one vote, such as Double Day Unlimited or a Double-Vote-themed game.<br>\n<br>\n7) A lynch will occur when a player achieves 50% +1 of the votes - a majority (for example, if there's 5 people left, there needs to be 3 votes to lynch someone; if there's 4 left, there still needs to be 3). When this has happened, any subsequent votes and unvotes will not be counted, and the game will enter twilight. Night will begin as soon as I have declared the lynch.<br>\n8) You may vote for a no lynch if desired. If at least 50% of the players in the game vote for a no lynch, the game will progress to night without a lynch (if there are 5 people left in the game, 3 need to vote for a no-lynch; if 4 are left, 2 need to). <br>\n9) Once you're dead, you are dead. You are allowed one more post WITHOUT information in it. Something like saying \"Darn, I was NKed!\" is fine.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">&gt; Activity &amp; Deadlines </div><br>\n<br>\n10) Treat this game as a commitment, and try your best to stay active. <br>\n11) Prods will be issued after 72 hours in a row without posting. If I keep having to prod  you (up to 3-4 times) I'll get angry and replace you. Players may request a prod on another player too if they haven't posted within 48 hours. I'm human and I may forget so if you want someone prodded just tell me.<br>\n<br>\n11a) If you do not open a prod within 24 hours of it being sent I will begin looking for a replacement.<br>\n12) Things come up in life, if you need time off for something, please let myself and the players know in-thread (and <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">in bold</div>) for V/LA purposes. I will be flexible, but if you can't be here for a significant amount of time I will replace you.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">13) Deadlines for each game day will be 3 weeks.</div><br>\n<br>\n14) In the event of a deadline ending without a player gaining a majority of votes, there will no lynch. No pluralities for lynching.<br>\n15) Nights will have a 72 hour deadline. If you fail to send in a night choice, I will automatically default to 'no choice' for that night, and you will do nothing. The night scene may not exactly be up after 72 hours, but give or take an hour or 10 and it will be.<br>\n<br>\n16) Deadlines will only be extended if I need a number of replacements, or barring some other freak circumstances. Apart from that, laziness, or anything else, will not result in a deadline extension.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">&gt; Other Information </div><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n17) <div style=\"display:inline;color:red\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">These are my colours and font I will use for modly purposes. All other colors except that used by my co-mod (if there is one) are fair game as long as they are easily read by your other players/myself, just don't post a rainbow.</div></div><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n18) I will try to post Vote Counts as often as possible. Hopefully once a page on the top of every page. If you feel a vote count is needed, don't hesitate to ask for one, and I'll provide one at the next opportunity.<br>\n<br>\n19) It's more than possible I've missed a rule or haven't completely covered something. Don't be a prick and try to exploit it, or I will end your existence. Yes that means modkill.<br>\n<br>\n20) I reserve the right to add more, or modify existing rules at any time. If this happens, I will let everyone know ASAP.<br>\n<br>\n21) No cryptography, not even for injokes. Do it once, and you'll get an in-thread warning. Do it twice, and it's instant mod-killing.<br>\n<br>\n22) <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING I NEED TO SEE (V/LAs, VC or replacement requests), BOLD IT!</div><br>\n<br>\n23) For Hydras: I expect you to post in your hydra account AT ALL POSSIBLE TIMES. I understand that there will be slip-ups and you'll post outside of it, but I expect that such instances to be EBWOP'ed into the hydra ASAP. If one side of a hydra posts outside of the hydra for a sufficient amount of posts/time without any prior reasoning, that head will be force-replaced without question (and possibly without warning if it's bad enough).<br>\n<br>\n24) (This is for replacements) <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">IF YOU ARE REPLACING SOMEONE, DO NOT POST IN THREAD UNTIL I HAVE RECIEVED YOUR CONFIRMATION PM AND HAVE CONFIRMED IN-THREAD THAT YOU HAVE REPLACED IN!</div> This will not only cut down on any potential confusion, but will also help me keep things running smoothly.<br>\n<br>\n25) Have fun!</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Sample VT Role wrote:</cite><br>\nHello, there!<br>\n<br>\nYou are just a regular townsperson here, yet you have one of the most powerful weapons against the maifa: Your ability to vote.

My alignment is VT, and it's definitely nothing special. If there's a PR that can protect people, don't waste your power protecting me. The only power that a VT has is his vote and his own ability to find scum through posting. S'bout it.<br>\n<br>\nThat said, I'm skeptical of ArcAngel, who said they supported my wagon but didn't get on it. Also, there's Amethyst Actor, who I can figure voted for me after I made myself an easy target and voted for him--but once it seemed like my wagon wasn't going anywhere, dropped the vote pretty fast. I could be overthinking hydra play, though, so I wouldn't put much weight into this observation.<br>\n<br>\nAnyway, the three people left on my wagon are Revenus, Magical7, and Fuzzyman, who all have given varying levels of substantial reason for voting for me, and I think their votes and reasons why should be taken into consideration. There's a fine line between scum pushing a wagon and town pressuring scum-suspects, and it lies in how the person joins the wagon and what kinds of questions they ask to the person who they're voting for.

I have a problem with this post not only because it's WIFOM, but because it feels like Mom is going out of her way to defend Varsoon.  Here are some more quotes where Amethyst unneccessesarily defends Varsoon:<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Amethyst Actor also wrote:</cite>[Varsoon] seems like he is a strong player, and I would like to keep him around even if he is VT. hell, even the way he claims VT is pro-town.<br>\n<br>\n~and in another post~<br>\n<br>\nFucking Hell, Dad. WTF is this? I'm not on board with a Varsoon wagon at all. First off, it's a move that's way to obvious and risky to take as scum, it shifts attention to him so WTF would he do it in the first place as scum?<br>\n<br>\nthis Varsoon wagon is retarded as fuck, and the speed of it is... Just no<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nI get an <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">interesting feeling</div> about how Amethyst, or at least Mom, treats Varsoon, relative to how she treats other people.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nWeasel words detected.<br>\n<br>\nScum found.<br>\n<br>\nInitiating scum catching sequence.<br>\n<br>\nPrint: PLEASE VOTE FUZZYMAN EVERYONE, THANKS ~Squidward<br>\n<br>\nEnd scum catching sequence.<br>\n<br>\nOn a more serious note, I don't like his portrayal of Amethyst Actor as a white knight.

My alignment is VT, and it's definitely nothing special. If there's a PR that can protect people, don't waste your power protecting me. The only power that a VT has is his vote and his own ability to find scum through posting. S'bout it.<br>\n<br>\nThat said, I'm skeptical of ArcAngel, who said they supported my wagon but didn't get on it. Also, there's Amethyst Actor, who I can figure voted for me after I made myself an easy target and voted for him--but once it seemed like my wagon wasn't going anywhere, dropped the vote pretty fast. I could be overthinking hydra play, though, so I wouldn't put much weight into this observation.<br>\n<br>\nAnyway, the three people left on my wagon are Revenus, Magical7, and Fuzzyman, who all have given varying levels of substantial reason for voting for me, and I think their votes and reasons why should be taken into consideration. There's a fine line between scum pushing a wagon and town pressuring scum-suspects, and it lies in how the person joins the wagon and what kinds of questions they ask to the person who they're voting for.

My alignment is VT, and it's definitely nothing special. If there's a PR that can protect people, don't waste your power protecting me. The only power that a VT has is his vote and his own ability to find scum through posting. S'bout it.<br>\n<br>\nThat said, I'm skeptical of ArcAngel, who said they supported my wagon but didn't get on it. Also, there's Amethyst Actor, who I can figure voted for me after I made myself an easy target and voted for him--but once it seemed like my wagon wasn't going anywhere, dropped the vote pretty fast. I could be overthinking hydra play, though, so I wouldn't put much weight into this observation.<br>\n<br>\nAnyway, the three people left on my wagon are Revenus, Magical7, and Fuzzyman, who all have given varying levels of substantial reason for voting for me, and I think their votes and reasons why should be taken into consideration. There's a fine line between scum pushing a wagon and town pressuring scum-suspects, and it lies in how the person joins the wagon and what kinds of questions they ask to the person who they're voting for.

This is why I continue to support a Varsoon lynch at the end of this day, everything else remaining the same.<br>\n<br>\nVarsoon started off the day showing an unusual fascination with starting up and maintaining wagons as a way to stir up discussion.  I thought that was interesting, but I didn't chalk it up as a scumtell immediately because I shared his enthusiasm for digging into some conversations.  Then came this post:<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4865884#p4865884\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4865884#p4865884\" data-post-id=\"4865884\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 59</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=20928\">Varsoon</a> wrote:</cite><br>\nI'm waiting for players to produce worthwhile content. I'm not happy with the current wagon, as it is largely based on groundless accusation. There's likely one scum on it, though.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nFortunately, Amethyst Actor calls him out for merely waiting for content rather than taking initiative and making it himself.  Varsoon responds with a flimsy argument in favor of an Amethyst wagon, based primarily on the belief that she had been \"moving attention around\" (what?) and that if she were town, a wagon would help people get a better read on her (Huh? Scum getting a PR read, perhaps?)  <br>\n<br>\nWhat slips by unnoticed here is the way he steps around questions stemming from when he said that \"There's likely one scum on [the wagon], though.\"  He says that he must have mistaken this game for some other, or \"skimmed too hard\" (wtf?), or read an unvote as a vote.  These excuses bother me a lot.  I know from experience that it's a lot easier to play as scum than as town when you aren't paying close attention to the thread.  When Varsoon suspected that there was scum \"on [the wagon],\" he may have been trying to talk without really saying anything.<br>\n<br>\nHalf an hour later, Varsoon asks Snappy to reveal his own role PM as he replaces out.  This is bloody outrageous.  It's even worse than the Varsoon roleclaim debacle which was to come later.  Would anybody have accepted Varsoon asking a random player his role PM when that person wasn't replacing out?  I sure hope not, and I like to think not.  His justification for the random rolefishing is as follows:<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4866489#p4866489\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4866489#p4866489\" data-post-id=\"4866489\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 78</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=20928\">Varsoon</a> wrote:</cite>If his role PM says scum, we get a free lynch.</div></blockquote><br>\nDid Varsoon, or even anyone in the game, think that this had even the slightest, most remote chance of happening?<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>IF otherwise, then we confirm a PR</div></blockquote><br>\nSo Varsoon likes for PRs to be out in the open.<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>or VT.</div></blockquote><br>\nIt has been discussed already in this thread why this is bad.<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>The only situation where this could be bad is if it's a PR and we don't have a PR that can protect players.</div></blockquote><br>\nAnd if he's a protection role himself?????<br>\n<br>\nThis post spoke for itself, and it was the tentative origin of the current Varsoon wagon.  Good.  Varsoon, through roleclaiming VT, was able to distract from this issue, which is why it wasn't discussed nearly enough.  I sincerely invite Varsoon to try and make some sense out it.  If he can.  Who knows?  Last time he was called upon to explain his PR outing attempt, all he could come up with was an appeal to emotion followed by a defensive roleclaim.

Varsoon responds with a flimsy argument in favor of an Amethyst wagon, based primarily on the belief that she had been \"moving attention around\" (what?) and that if she were town, a wagon would help people get a better read on her (Huh?

These excuses bother me a lot.  I know from experience that it's a lot easier to play as scum than as town when you aren't paying close attention to the thread.

Less so GreyICE's slot.  It occurs to me that GreyICE's early votes may have been simply throwing out a bunch of weak names and hoping and waiting so that one would stick.  He's experienced, so he knows that it's better for scum to lead a wagon than to follow on board one.

I had a conversation with Slandaar on his earlier read, during which he promised to add an argument to his read, but he never did. Hence also why I seriously dislike his play style. I am hoping, against my better judgement, that he elaborate on that earlier read and why he decided to change your slot to town in his second read.<br>\n<br>\nAs for the one-slot-two-players situation, I did not and still do not find Revenus' play scummy. That does not make him town. In effect, that does not make you town. You forgetting to unvote while requesting Revenus' name be changed to yours in the votecount is scummy. I would have been more inclined to let that pass if it weren't for Fuzzy explaining why you did it as opposed to you yourself. In total, Rev's null-read and your scum-read combine into a scum-read.

Seriously the major town read and basically going along with what Grey says seems fishy... Where is your sense of suspicion and skepticism?  (From Dad I would like to know why he was glad Grey replaced in?)  <br>\n<br>\n<br>\nI said I would look back since you stated you had a case that was NOT based on Grey's case... Looking at these quotes I do not see it... Everything talks about Grey's case and even Fuzzy's (though you also stated here you suspected him because of the claim.  <br>\n<br>\nYour point to Kid about Jebus... I do want to take another look at him cause his vote on me was rather suspicious.... Not cause he voted me, but the WAY he voted me, of course so is Var's vote, but Var is a newbie Jebus is far from being one.... <br>\nBut again you whiteknight the heck out of Grey as this paragon of towniness... <br>\n<br>\nI also disagree with you on him being the leader, Slandaar would make a far better choice there, if you want someone to pay attention to, Grey is either scum, or totally off in left field as a townie... He uses no logic, makes no real cases, just goes around saying you are scum.  Plus he keeps misrepping me..  I was not defending Fuzzy, I was stating it was possible to have a one shot doc in the game... that's all....  I stated that if deadline came, I would revote Fuzzy to prevent a NL, and clearly no one felt Grey was scum but me, so yeah I did what I said I would do... <br>\n<br>\nI kinda agree with you on this a bit I think Var is prob town and basically making newbie mistakes, I deal with a lot of newbies so yeah.. moving on<br>\n<br>\nLast point the one about Magical most definitely does not hold water... Seriously?  A scum would never go out of their way to defend someone???<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nExhibit A <br>\n<br>\nNewbie 1206....<br>\n<br>\nMeta watches a struggling newbie in her very first game on site... She had done a lot of research so knew a lot about theory but had never played Mafia before anywhere.  He decides to defend her to the utmost..... suddenly toward the end of the game the big crash.....<br>\n<br>\ncome back after the crash and it is LYLO  Newbie chick cant think of a reason why Meta would have defended her so much, plus the other player (Elmo teh Azn), has really lost interest in the game and plays all meh-like.... Newbie chick votes for Elmo....<br>\n<br>\nMeta was scum............. Oh and the Newbie chick was the Doc and was me.  <br>\n<br>\nSo yeah not good enough... <br>\n<br>\nYour case on me sucks... <br>\n<br>\nThat being said, I am not sure you are scum though... I really think Grey is.   But clearly no one is going to vote for him...<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nI am also working in between posts on mafia, so please do intent to hammer and give me time to claim and respond... <br>\n<br>\nThanks.", "time": "Tue Apr 30, 2013 8:06 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=27171&start=700", "forum": "53", "thread": "27171"}

I'm content he's town, subject to his reasons.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Why Jacon must die, a short message</div></div><br>\n<br>\nCompared to most of you, I'm a veteran.  I did not cash in on this status day 1 - I never mentioned my years of experience while pushing Revanus/Rach, I did not use them as arguments.  I use them here for two reasons - the first, you should see the fruits of my experience.  Second, because this is based partially on mafia theory.<br>\n<br>\nJacon is independently scummy.  Look at his behavior day 1.  Willing to push Fuzzy wagon?  Check.  Willing to push Varsoon?  Definitely nosed out in that direction.  Willing to push Rach?  HAHAHAHA.  He never addresses Rach or Revanus in any way.  NO ADDRESS AT ALL.  This independently makes him scummy, because while he was clearly pushing the counterwagons to Rach, he never commented on Rach's scumminess.  He was deep on my radar screen from day 1 (review my comments at the end of the day - I had him and Rach as my firm scum reads, with a 3rd floater).  <br>\n<br>\nHis behavior day 2 should upgrade him to a 100% policy lynch.  There is no reason, NO REASON AT ALL to behave like he did.  Rach's claim had so very many holes in it.<br>\n<br>\n- She believed Fuzzy's terrible claim without question, even though a jailkeeper would question it.  <br>\n- She failed to out the information immediately day 2, even though she should have known she would draw heavy pressure<br>\n- She VOTED FOR ME OVER A PERSON WHO SHOULD HAVE BEEN CONFIRMED SCUM<br>\n- She offered alternate scenarios to Varsoon being scum, even though he should have been confirmed scum to her.  <br>\n<br>\nDespite this, Jacon doesn't even question her claims.  Remember, up until this point, Jacon had directed ZERO questions to her.  None.  He never addresses her at any point.  He does not defend her, he does not attack her.  He simply quietly pushes wagons that are not Rach.  He helped push Fuzzyman to lynch.  He tried to push Varsoon with no plausible reason to think Varsoon was scum.  <br>\n<br>\nYou can hypothesize he is simply a very very dim townie who is bad at mafia.  Does this make sense?  No.  No, it does not stand up to scrutiny.  If you are 100% convinced someone is town, why did he never try and coalition build with her?  Townies address townies all the time in this thread, trying to convince them to vote a certain way.  Yet Jacon never even talks to Rach in any way, despite being so sure that she's town that he's <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">100% convinced</div> Varsoon is scum based on her \"information.\" <br>\n<br>\nMoreover, he tries to push townies to vote.  <br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4920122#p4920122\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4920122#p4920122\" data-post-id=\"4920122\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 733</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=21257\">Jacon</a> wrote:</cite><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Varsoon</span><br>\n<br>\nWhy?

You're once again derping and failed to see when I genuinely tried to be CIVIL, I don't hate anyone, I am just annoyed with your play.  You're just an horrible player. <br>\n<br>\nYou said that you played more 200 mafia games, that must be some kind of joke or some kind of record for people who let you play those many games. Seriously? Is this how you played all those 200 games? <br>\n<br>\nTalking about your reads. That&#8217;s all you could say for 36 pages? <br>\nAnd what exactly you&#8217;re trying to prove by saying that you have a town read on Varson, you know that he is killed right? What is the point of talking about dead flips when everyone knows what it is. <br>\nWho is Jazz? Do you mean Jacon the hdyra? What do you mean he is kind of Green..?   I can clearly tell you that your bolded statement make no sense to me..<br>\n<br>\nSo, you&#8217;re suspicious of me becuz you think I hate you, and what makes you think that I am being friendly to you?  Quote me the post that I looked in a friendly way.. all I tried is to be Civil so that it helps the game. And btw, Like I already mentioned to you.. That I don&#8217;t hate you, but I don&#8217;t like you either. I think you&#8217;re just a bad players with an ugly mouth.  The things you spoke to me on Jason&#8217;s dead QT wasn&#8217;t appropriate, so I am frustrated , that doesn&#8217;t mean that I ll play against my win condition, players on this site knows what kind of person I am. If you had a problem and you know it for certain that I will hate you in regards with no matter, Why did you replace yourself into a game that I am playing?  You could have possibly avoid this and signed up in a new game or got into something else? <br>\n<br>\nYou again contradicted your own statements by saying &#8220;that you have no problem with me&#8221; yet you&#8217;re the one who is running around and screaming that &#8220;I hate you&#8221; Not me. <br>\n<br>\nAnd I would really like to hear how you think I am buddying up with AA,?   Explain or quote my posts that I have said that looked like am buddying with her.  If you don&#8217;t I am so going to put my vote on you for tunneling, accusing falsely and for voting with no reason like an opportunist scum. <br>\n<br>\n And that is all you can say after the catch up? Seriously?  You talked about two dead people, AA and me.  You said the both the dead people are town&#8230; (alas...which we already knew it),  AA appears scum because she acknowledges your opening post which heads up the potential attacks of yours to me. And for the same reason, she became my scum buddy.. Wow, this is some kind of record scum hunting that I have never seen in my life..    <br>\n<br>\nAnd finally, where the hell is your reads on others?  How could you don&#8217;t have any opinion on them yet?", "time": "Tue May 14, 2013 10:01 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=27171&start=900", "forum": "53", "thread": "27171"}

I'm not sure why you left that out of the quote there. If you want my original case on Jebus, I refer you to post 776. Add to that the fact that he seems to have disappeared all of a sudden, only coming back to fail to place a vote on the largest wagon, and I am very confident with his lynch. What I was trying to say in the post you quoted is that should Jebus flip town, I would take a closer look at Slandaar. If Jebus flips scum and the game is not yet over, we have hit scum and kept the better of those two players alive. I don't think they're scum together, though I'd have to reread to be more sure of that.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nAlso, I do not mind getting lynched. My play has been absolutely awful and I'm mostly a distraction from real scum. My mislynch shouldn't really matter too, because you should lynch Jebus as well and it shouldn't be that hard to win the game after that, if the game even continues beyond that.
