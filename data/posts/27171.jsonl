Depending on the circumstance, you may be able to paraphrase things I have sent you (such as a role PM). Use common sense and if you are unsure feel free to ask me via PM.<br><br>4) Be courteous to your fellow player. This is just a game - please don't bring personal grudges into the game. Try and keep it civil. If you cross 'the line' I'll step in. Said line will be judged by me.<br><br><br><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">&gt; Voting, Lynching &amp; Death </span><br><br>5) For your vote to be counted, it must be bold, and in the form <span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: Voidedmafia</span>. Caps and colons are optional, but it does need to be bolded. The vote tags are also appropriate for voting.<br><br>5a) Broken bold tags won't count. Mispellings or shortened names are ok as long as it is clear who you are voting. If I can't tell who you're voting, it won't count. <br><br>5c) VOTES MUST BE ON A COMPLETELY SEPARATE LINE FROM ANY OTHER TEXT! Any votes that are NOT on a separate line WILL NOT BE COUNTED EVER, and I will NOT be flexible on this. You either have it on it's own line, or suck it up.<br><br>6) Unvotes aren't necessary before placing a new vote. However, unvotes are necessary if you want to completely remove your vote. Please bold your unvotes or use the unvote tags. It is not necessary to name the player you are unvoting, except in instances where you may have more than one vote, such as Double Day Unlimited or a Double-Vote-themed game.<br><br>7) A lynch will occur when a player achieves 50% +1 of the votes - a majority (for example, if there's 5 people left, there needs to be 3 votes to lynch someone; if there's 4 left, there still needs to be 3). When this has happened, any subsequent votes and unvotes will not be counted, and the game will enter twilight. Night will begin as soon as I have declared the lynch.<br>8) You may vote for a no lynch if desired. If at least 50% of the players in the game vote for a no lynch, the game will progress to night without a lynch (if there are 5 people left in the game, 3 need to vote for a no-lynch; if 4 are left, 2 need to). <br>9) Once you're dead, you are dead. You are allowed one more post WITHOUT information in it. Something like saying \"Darn, I was NKed!\" is fine.<br><br><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">&gt; Activity &amp; Deadlines </span><br><br>10) Treat this game as a commitment, and try your best to stay active. <br>11) Prods will be issued after 72 hours in a row without posting. If I keep having to prod  you (up to 3-4 times) I'll get angry and replace you. Players may request a prod on another player too if they haven't posted within 48 hours. I'm human and I may forget so if you want someone prodded just tell me.<br><br>11a) If you do not open a prod within 24 hours of it being sent I will begin looking for a replacement.<br>12) Things come up in life, if you need time off for something, please let myself and the players know in-thread (and <span class=\"noboldsig\">in bold</span>) for V/LA purposes. I will be flexible, but if you can't be here for a significant amount of time I will replace you.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">13) Deadlines for each game day will be 3 weeks.</span><br><br>14) In the event of a deadline ending without a player gaining a majority of votes, there will no lynch. No pluralities for lynching.<br>15) Nights will have a 72 hour deadline. If you fail to send in a night choice, I will automatically default to 'no choice' for that night, and you will do nothing. The night scene may not exactly be up after 72 hours, but give or take an hour or 10 and it will be.<br><br>16) Deadlines will only be extended if I need a number of replacements, or barring some other freak circumstances. Apart from that, laziness, or anything else, will not result in a deadline extension.<br><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">&gt; Other Information </span><br><br><br>17) <span style=\"color: red\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">These are my colours and font I will use for modly purposes. All other colors except that used by my co-mod (if there is one) are fair game as long as they are easily read by your other players/myself, just don't post a rainbow.</span></span></span><br><br><br>18) I will try to post Vote Counts as often as possible. Hopefully once a page on the top of every page. If you feel a vote count is needed, don't hesitate to ask for one, and I'll provide one at the next opportunity.<br><br>19) It's more than possible I've missed a rule or haven't completely covered something. Don't be a prick and try to exploit it, or I will end your existence. Yes that means modkill.<br><br>20) I reserve the right to add more, or modify existing rules at any time. If this happens, I will let everyone know ASAP.<br><br>21) No cryptography, not even for injokes. Do it once, and you'll get an in-thread warning. Do it twice, and it's instant mod-killing.<br><br>22) <span class=\"noboldsig\">IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING I NEED TO SEE (V/LAs, VC or replacement requests), BOLD IT!</span><br><br>23) For Hydras: I expect you to post in your hydra account AT ALL POSSIBLE TIMES. I understand that there will be slip-ups and you'll post outside of it, but I expect that such instances to be EBWOP'ed into the hydra ASAP. If one side of a hydra posts outside of the hydra for a sufficient amount of posts/time without any prior reasoning, that head will be force-replaced without question (and possibly without warning if it's bad enough).<br><br>24) (This is for replacements) <span class=\"noboldsig\">IF YOU ARE REPLACING SOMEONE, DO NOT POST IN THREAD UNTIL I HAVE RECIEVED YOUR CONFIRMATION PM AND HAVE CONFIRMED IN-THREAD THAT YOU HAVE REPLACED IN!</span> This will not only cut down on any potential confusion, but will also help me keep things running smoothly.<br><br>25) Have fun!</div></div></div><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Sample VT Role wrote:</cite>Hello, there!<br><br>You are just a regular townsperson here, yet you have one of the most powerful weapons against the maifa: Your ability to vote.

I could be overthinking hydra play, though, so I wouldn't put much weight into this observation.<br><br>Anyway, the three people left on my wagon are Revenus, Magical7, and Fuzzyman, who all have given varying levels of substantial reason for voting for me, and I think their votes and reasons why should be taken into consideration.

I don't want to be opaque.  A few games ago, I was the first in a long string of votes on me as we got out of the RVS.  It turned out later that the last bandwagoner on me was scum.

Don't you see how silly that is?<br><br>Scumhunting isn't about trying to find scum motivations in people's actions; it's more about figuring out whose actions completely lack town motivations.  This is why I continue to support a Varsoon lynch at the end of this day, everything else remaining the same.<br><br>Varsoon started off the day showing an unusual fascination with starting up and maintaining wagons as a way to stir up discussion.  I thought that was interesting, but I didn't chalk it up as a scumtell immediately because I shared his enthusiasm for digging into some conversations.  Then came this post:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=4865884#p4865884\" class=\"postlink\">post 59</a>, Varsoon wrote:</cite>I'm waiting for players to produce worthwhile content. I'm not happy with the current wagon, as it is largely based on groundless accusation. There's likely one scum on it, though.</div></blockquote><br><br>Fortunately, Amethyst Actor calls him out for merely waiting for content rather than taking initiative and making it himself.  Varsoon responds with a flimsy argument in favor of an Amethyst wagon, based primarily on the belief that she had been \"moving attention around\" (what?) and that if she were town, a wagon would help people get a better read on her (Huh? Scum getting a PR read, perhaps?)  <br><br>What slips by unnoticed here is the way he steps around questions stemming from when he said that \"There's likely one scum on [the wagon], though.\"  He says that he must have mistaken this game for some other, or \"skimmed too hard\" (wtf?), or read an unvote as a vote.  These excuses bother me a lot.  I know from experience that it's a lot easier to play as scum than as town when you aren't paying close attention to the thread.  When Varsoon suspected that there was scum \"on [the wagon],\" he may have been trying to talk without really saying anything.<br><br>Half an hour later, Varsoon asks Snappy to reveal his own role PM as he replaces out.  This is bloody outrageous.  It's even worse than the Varsoon roleclaim debacle which was to come later.  Would anybody have accepted Varsoon asking a random player his role PM when that person wasn't replacing out?  I sure hope not, and I like to think not.  His justification for the random rolefishing is as follows:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=4866489#p4866489\" class=\"postlink\">post 78</a>, Varsoon wrote:</cite>If his role PM says scum, we get a free lynch.</div></blockquote><br>Did Varsoon, or even anyone in the game, think that this had even the slightest, most remote chance of happening?<br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>IF otherwise, then we confirm a PR</div></blockquote><br>So Varsoon likes for PRs to be out in the open.<br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>or VT.</div></blockquote><br>It has been discussed already in this thread why this is bad.<br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>The only situation where this could be bad is if it's a PR and we don't have a PR that can protect players.</div></blockquote><br>And if he's a protection role himself?????<br><br>This post spoke for itself, and it was the tentative origin of the current Varsoon wagon.  Good.  Varsoon, through roleclaiming VT, was able to distract from this issue, which is why it wasn't discussed nearly enough.  I sincerely invite Varsoon to try and make some sense out it.  If he can.  Who knows?  Last time he was called upon to explain his PR outing attempt, all he could come up with was an appeal to emotion followed by a defensive roleclaim.  Better luck this time, I hope.<br><br><div align=\"center\"><hr style=\"height:14px; width:75%\"></div><br>I could continue this case easily, but it's 1:00 in my timezone, and I have school in the morning.

I thought that was interesting, but I didn't chalk it up as a scumtell immediately because I shared his enthusiasm for digging into some conversations.

I'm not happy with the current wagon, as it is largely based on groundless accusation. There's likely one scum on it, though.</div></blockquote><br><br>Fortunately, Amethyst Actor calls him out for merely waiting for content rather than taking initiative and making it himself.  Varsoon responds with a flimsy argument in favor of an Amethyst wagon, based primarily on the belief that she had been \"moving attention around\" (what?) and that if she were town, a wagon would help people get a better read on her (Huh? Scum getting a PR read, perhaps?)  <br><br>What slips by unnoticed here is the way he steps around questions stemming from when he said that \"There's likely one scum on [the wagon], though.\"  He says that he must have mistaken this game for some other, or \"skimmed too hard\" (wtf?), or read an unvote as a vote.  These excuses bother me a lot.  I know from experience that it's a lot easier to play as scum than as town when you aren't paying close attention to the thread.  When Varsoon suspected that there was scum \"on [the wagon],\" he may have been trying to talk without really saying anything.</div></blockquote><br><br>So many bad arguments in here, says that Varsoon wanting a wagon on Amethyst to read them is from scum trying to get a PR read (it could be simply town wanting to get a town/scum read off the wagon's pressure).<br><br>The excuses that bother fuzzy a lot, could simply be honest to god what happened, course he turns it into something scummy.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Half an hour later, Varsoon asks Snappy to reveal his own role PM as he replaces out.

Good.  Varsoon, through roleclaiming VT, was able to distract from this issue, which is why it wasn't discussed nearly enough.  I sincerely invite Varsoon to try and make some sense out it.  If he can.  Who knows?  Last time he was called upon to explain his PR outing attempt, all he could come up with was an appeal to emotion followed by a defensive roleclaim.

I had a conversation with Slandaar on his earlier read, during which he promised to add an argument to his read, but he never did. Hence also why I seriously dislike his play style. I am hoping, against my better judgement, that he elaborate on that earlier read and why he decided to change your slot to town in his second read.<br><br>As for the one-slot-two-players situation, I did not and still do not find Revenus' play scummy. That does not make him town. In effect, that does not make you town. You forgetting to unvote while requesting Revenus' name be changed to yours in the votecount is scummy. I would have been more inclined to let that pass if it weren't for Fuzzy explaining why you did it as opposed to you yourself. In total, Rev's null-read and your scum-read combine into a scum-read. Does this clear up my point?"}

Doctor is already the go-to scum fakeclaim.  Literally, the go-to claim.  High value role, impossible to prove, etc.  1-shot means the odds of you being counterclaimed are virtually null (you could conceivably have a town with a doctor AND a 1-shot doctor, if the moderator was sadistic).  It's also a weird include from a moderator.  It's 95% likely to never prevent a kill, so it would basically make the player a VT - but if you calculate the player like a VT, there's a 5% chance the scum lose a night kill, making the role swingy and bad."}

She repeatedly hawked that she hadn't been able to rwad the thread and produce suspects, while she was able to both post elsewhere AND, worse, read and cogently respond to people on what was the most recent page.  When she did say who she suspected, her attacks almost perfectly lined up with who had been accusing her.  She often gives information instead of analysis.  Revenus lurked.  The fact that she immediately unvoted after my claim signals to me that she didn't have much real conviction.  I think she expected more people to unvote.  She is very emotional.  She mireps the ever-loving hell out of other players."}

That light non bolded red on the sepia skin is really hard to read.  I still love our mod dearly, but yeah there are reasons I use bolded blue when I mod.... So much easier to read.  That is my fault though for not reading more carefully knowing that there is low contrast.  I will not blame that on my vision since I should compensate for that. <br><br> Not searching for pity, if you meta stalk all my games I am in currently and the ones that just finished (I can give links to those), you will see I have been having RL issues all over the place, and I definitely do not have the same alignment in every game...

Seriously the major town read and basically going along with what Grey says seems fishy... Where is your sense of suspicion and skepticism?  (From Dad I would like to know why he was glad Grey replaced in?)  <br><br><br>I said I would look back since you stated you had a case that was NOT based on Grey's case... Looking at these quotes I do not see it... Everything talks about Grey's case and even Fuzzy's (though you also stated here you suspected him because of the claim.  <br><br>Your point to Kid about Jebus... I do want to take another look at him cause his vote on me was rather suspicious.... Not cause he voted me, but the WAY he voted me, of course so is Var's vote, but Var is a newbie Jebus is far from being one.... <br>But again you whiteknight the heck out of Grey as this paragon of towniness... <br><br>I also disagree with you on him being the leader, Slandaar would make a far better choice there, if you want someone to pay attention to, Grey is either scum, or totally off in left field as a townie... He uses no logic, makes no real cases, just goes around saying you are scum.  Plus he keeps misrepping me..  I was not defending Fuzzy, I was stating it was possible to have a one shot doc in the game... that's all....  I stated that if deadline came, I would revote Fuzzy to prevent a NL, and clearly no one felt Grey was scum but me, so yeah I did what I said I would do... <br><br>I kinda agree with you on this a bit I think Var is prob town and basically making newbie mistakes, I deal with a lot of newbies so yeah.. moving on<br><br>Last point the one about Magical most definitely does not hold water... Seriously?  A scum would never go out of their way to defend someone???<br><br><br>Exhibit A <br><br>Newbie 1206....<br><br>Meta watches a struggling newbie in her very first game on site... She had done a lot of research so knew a lot about theory but had never played Mafia before anywhere.  He decides to defend her to the utmost..... suddenly toward the end of the game the big crash.....<br><br>come back after the crash and it is LYLO  Newbie chick cant think of a reason why Meta would have defended her so much, plus the other player (Elmo teh Azn), has really lost interest in the game and plays all meh-like.... Newbie chick votes for Elmo....<br><br>Meta was scum............. Oh and the Newbie chick was the Doc and was me.  <br><br>So yeah not good enough... <br><br>Your case on me sucks... <br><br>That being said, I am not sure you are scum though... I really think Grey is.   But clearly no one is going to vote for him...<br><br><br>I am also working in between posts on mafia, so please do intent to hammer and give me time to claim and respond... <br><br>Thanks."}

You're once again derping and failed to see when I genuinely tried to be CIVIL, I don't hate anyone, I am just annoyed with your play.  You're just an horrible player. <br><br>You said that you played more 200 mafia games, that must be some kind of joke or some kind of record for people who let you play those many games. Seriously? Is this how you played all those 200 games? <br><br>Talking about your reads. That\u2019s all you could say for 36 pages? <br>And what exactly you\u2019re trying to prove by saying that you have a town read on Varson, you know that he is killed right? What is the point of talking about dead flips when everyone knows what it is. <br>Who is Jazz? Do you mean Jacon the hdyra? What do you mean he is kind of Green..?   I can clearly tell you that your bolded statement make no sense to me..<br><br>So, you\u2019re suspicious of me becuz you think I hate you, and what makes you think that I am being friendly to you?  Quote me the post that I looked in a friendly way.. all I tried is to be Civil so that it helps the game. And btw, Like I already mentioned to you.. That I don\u2019t hate you, but I don\u2019t like you either. I think you\u2019re just a bad players with an ugly mouth.  The things you spoke to me on Jason\u2019s dead QT wasn\u2019t appropriate, so I am frustrated , that doesn\u2019t mean that I ll play against my win condition, players on this site knows what kind of person I am. If you had a problem and you know it for certain that I will hate you in regards with no matter, Why did you replace yourself into a game that I am playing?  You could have possibly avoid this and signed up in a new game or got into something else? <br><br>You again contradicted your own statements by saying \u201cthat you have no problem with me\u201d yet you\u2019re the one who is running around and screaming that \u201cI hate you\u201d Not me. <br><br>And I would really like to hear how you think I am buddying up with AA,?   Explain or quote my posts that I have said that looked like am buddying with her.  If you don\u2019t I am so going to put my vote on you for tunneling, accusing falsely and for voting with no reason like an opportunist scum. <br><br> And that is all you can say after the catch up? Seriously?  You talked about two dead people, AA and me.  You said the both the dead people are town\u2026 (alas...which we already knew it),  AA appears scum because she acknowledges your opening post which heads up the potential attacks of yours to me. And for the same reason, she became my scum buddy.. Wow, this is some kind of record scum hunting that I have never seen in my life..    <br><br>And finally, where the hell is your reads on others?  How could you don\u2019t have any opinion on them yet?"}

You're once again derping and failed to see when I genuinely tried to be CIVIL, I don't hate anyone, I am just annoyed with your play.  You're just an horrible player. <br><br>You said that you played more 200 mafia games, that must be some kind of joke or some kind of record for people who let you play those many games. Seriously? Is this how you played all those 200 games? <br><br>Talking about your reads. That\u2019s all you could say for 36 pages? <br>And what exactly you\u2019re trying to prove by saying that you have a town read on Varson, you know that he is killed right? What is the point of talking about dead flips when everyone knows what it is. <br>Who is Jazz? Do you mean Jacon the hdyra? What do you mean he is kind of Green..?   I can clearly tell you that your bolded statement make no sense to me..<br><br>So, you\u2019re suspicious of me becuz you think I hate you, and what makes you think that I am being friendly to you?  Quote me the post that I looked in a friendly way.. all I tried is to be Civil so that it helps the game. And btw, Like I already mentioned to you.. That I don\u2019t hate you, but I don\u2019t like you either. I think you\u2019re just a bad players with an ugly mouth.  The things you spoke to me on Jason\u2019s dead QT wasn\u2019t appropriate, so I am frustrated , that doesn\u2019t mean that I ll play against my win condition, players on this site knows what kind of person I am. If you had a problem and you know it for certain that I will hate you in regards with no matter, Why did you replace yourself into a game that I am playing?  You could have possibly avoid this and signed up in a new game or got into something else? <br><br>You again contradicted your own statements by saying \u201cthat you have no problem with me\u201d yet you\u2019re the one who is running around and screaming that \u201cI hate you\u201d Not me. <br><br>And I would really like to hear how you think I am buddying up with AA,?   Explain or quote my posts that I have said that looked like am buddying with her.  If you don\u2019t I am so going to put my vote on you for tunneling, accusing falsely and for voting with no reason like an opportunist scum. <br><br> And that is all you can say after the catch up? Seriously?  You talked about two dead people, AA and me.  You said the both the dead people are town\u2026 (alas...which we already knew it),  AA appears scum because she acknowledges your opening post which heads up the potential attacks of yours to me. And for the same reason, she became my scum buddy.. Wow, this is some kind of record scum hunting that I have never seen in my life..    <br><br>And finally, where the hell is your reads on others?

That means I'm not completely familiar with possible setups. However, that does not mean that I will blindly agree to what you're saying. Also, even if there are certainly PRs, there's still the possibility for someone not outing they're a PR.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Kid A wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=4963297#p4963297\" class=\"postlink\">post 1010</a>, Magical7 wrote:</cite>&lt;snip&gt;<br>Throughout this game, I never really liked you, but this is the first time that I'm starting to feel like you're being scummy.

I'm not sure why you left that out of the quote there. If you want my original case on Jebus, I refer you to post 776. Add to that the fact that he seems to have disappeared all of a sudden, only coming back to fail to place a vote on the largest wagon, and I am very confident with his lynch. What I was trying to say in the post you quoted is that should Jebus flip town, I would take a closer look at Slandaar. If Jebus flips scum and the game is not yet over, we have hit scum and kept the better of those two players alive. I don't think they're scum together, though I'd have to reread to be more sure of that.<br><br><br>Also, I do not mind getting lynched. My play has been absolutely awful and I'm mostly a distraction from real scum. My mislynch shouldn't really matter too, because you should lynch Jebus as well and it shouldn't be that hard to win the game after that, if the game even continues beyond that. Though I'd prefer to survive until after the Jebus lynch if possible."}

Look at his accusations against you, look at how he progressed from attacking the fuck out of you to how he now buddies the fuck out of you, how he has you as very, very likely scum when he replaced in to how he has you as very, very likely town here.<br><br>He now says that you're reaction when he replaced in is legit, even though that was his main reason for calling you scum when he replaced in. even though he used that as the main reason to continue to push you as scum, and how he only now stopped calling you scum because he knows he isn't going to get both townies to vote for you, and he needs both townies to vote for you to pull through on this win.</div></blockquote></span></div></div></div><br>I see.<br>I call one scum in you angel on my second post.. i said i town read you more than her.. it was an early post.I said 1 between you and AA9 were mafia in my second post, and i was right so don't call me noob and don't lie.<br>THe fact i said you were more town then AA9 doesn't mean i thought you were town.<br>sometime i have lapsus ( forgot magic7 was dead) or i miss read since i came in this game when i had a lot to read.. so i focused in the main parts, and i thought jabus and jacob where the only hyra( my bad)<br>I think it hilarious how now you ask angel to defend you, when the mafia it either you or her.<br>And aftet this Tl;dr i more sure.<br>I mean in all the game you post were always shot and like mom say, dad say.<br>Now you getting seriours?<br>you feel like losing the game?<br>oh...Well IF it Angel i'll laugh so hard."}
