Possible reasons why:<br>a) He actually, genuinely wants to warn us that he thinks Boonskiies is completely insane as VT, and the town is better off if he's lynched, regardless of alignment.  Possible but seems unlikely when Boonskiies hasn't done anything to warrant the meta-warning yet.<br>b) Zebulin is scum and wishes to encourage a lynch of Boonskiies, who he knows is town.<br>c) They're both scum and he was trying to provide an excuse for any later mistakes by Boon.<br>d) I'm overanalyzing random chatter from this stage of the game.<br>All of these are possible.  Personally, I suspect Zebulin because he seems outright manipulative already - he's trying to affect how we look at Boonskiies when we've barely even started.<br><br>Also, a point to do with your post that confused me, Zeb: wouldn't tunneling him because you think he's anti-town produce the same negative result as it did in that previous game, since a town-flip by him would inevitably implicate you?

Look at Zeb's reaction.  You can't force someone to claim by saying you're pushing for a claim, not a lynch - it destroys the pressure of being at L-1.  Is this just a poor excuse from BBT to try and avoid responsibility if Zeb flips town?  There are plenty of pro-town reasons for not wanting to claim, as Zeb pointed out.  I'm not saying that Zeb is necessarily town - this doesn't really affect my view of him - but BBT's stated intent to force a claim seems very fishy to me.  Care to share your reasons, BBT?  I'm hoping you have a better excuse than \"I was PR-hunting\", because that's blatant scumminess.<br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: Zebulin</span><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: BlueBloodedToffee</span><br>To clarify, Zeb is far from off the hook in terms of suspicion for me, but I think the issues with BBT are what needs to be brought to peoples' attention.<br><br>PS: I don't think Zeb is likely to PR-claim all game (except if he actually thinks he's about to be lynched), due to the fact that his actions at the start of the game only make sense as VT or scum.

Look at Zeb's reaction.  You can't force someone to claim by saying you're pushing for a claim, not a lynch - it destroys the pressure of being at L-1.  Is this just a poor excuse from BBT to try and avoid responsibility if Zeb flips town?  There are plenty of pro-town reasons for not wanting to claim, as Zeb pointed out.  I'm not saying that Zeb is necessarily town - this doesn't really affect my view of him - but BBT's stated intent to force a claim seems very fishy to me.  Care to share your reasons, BBT?

I... would also like to point out that your third \"associative tells\" scumread is the last person who was pressuring me, although I do agree with you on Slandaar being suspicious.  Still, considering he was trying to make a case against me, it would be awfully convenient if he got lynched.  Most of this argument is paranoia, though - I acknowledge that this particular case is pretty weak and I should probably drop it.  It doesn't really make you look any more like town or scum than you already do.<br><br>Do I think it's good play for scum to openly admit to PR-hunting?  No, but you clearly were trying to get one person to claim, so if you're saying you weren't PR-hunting, you start to contradict yourself.  PR-hunting done one at a time and stopped when someone notices is still PR-hunting, and even if you <span style=\"font-style: italic\">weren't</span> PR-hunting, there's still the point that you wanted Zeb to claim.  <span style=\"font-style: italic\">Why?</span>  This has the same effect as PR-hunting - it reveals to the mafia that they either should or shouldn't NK someone.<br><br>Also, in this very post, you first imply that you admitted you were PR-hunting (citing it as bad scum play and a reason why you aren't scum).  Then you deny PR-hunting.  While I realize that you've been periodically denying it all game, here and in Post #160 you imply that you've admitted to PR-hunting.  Please decide.  Are you less scummy because you've admitted to PR-hunting or less scummy because you haven't been PR-hunting?  You can't use both arguments.<br><br>It's not even the PR-hunting itself that bothers me anymore - it's that you keep contradicting yourself.  I do think that it's very suspicious that Zeb thought PR-hunting might seem like a good idea to you and decided <span style=\"font-style: italic\">not</span> to lynch over it, and I don't like that a few players have next to no actual content, but unless someone does something outstandingly scummy, I'd rather chase you until I've resolved my issues with your posts."}

However, answer this, please: how many times have you run someone up to L-1 with the stated intention not to lynch and gotten a scumclaim.  And for that matter, how many times have you seen scum confess at L-1?  Aren't they more likely to try and lie their way out?  It seems to me like this particular brand of pressure (no intent to lynch but not telling them that) is the kind that exposes PRs, not scum.<br><br>If Page 3 and Page 20 are both on Day 1, you're right, there is no difference.  However, are you really asking me why it's better for town to have a PR survive and be able to use their power for an additional day?  Is that really a question you don't already know the answer to?  It's not like a PR absolutely has to be exposed D1.  Pressuring people with fake L-1 will only expose town PRs, because there's <span style=\"font-style: italic\">no reason</span> for scum to ever confess to being scum.  Do you really not understand why it's bad to force a real PR to claim at all?<br><br>Evidently I did misinterpret your posts.  I'm just going to take that at face value - there's absolutely no reason for anyone to admit to PR-hunting, and it would be one of the weirdest slips I can imagine, so yeah, sorry.

If you really did want to see whether or not Zeb would claim when pressured, why destroy the pressure by admitting to pushing for a claim?  I do also agree that if we're going to force someone to decide whether or not to claim today because we plan to lynch them, it's better to do it earlier rather than later, but I present to you a scenario which could have happened (as a result of us pressuring someone who we had no idea whether we were actually going to lynch at the end of the day).<br>Zeb claims PR (doctor, cop, tracker, whatever).  People aren't entirely convinced, but they find someone else who they'd rather lynch.  Then Zeb is nightkilled and flips PR.  I'm not going to ask a rhetorical question at the end of this, because that would be an insult to your intelligence.  Draw your own conclusions.<br><br>Do people have a problem with early pressure?  I think I said that I <span style=\"font-style: italic\">don't</span> - I just find it very, very strange that you ruined your own attempt to pressure Zeb halfway in.  Early pressure is all well and good, but my impression from your attempt was that you were trying to look like you were pressuring Zeb.  Which... would actually lead me to the conclusion that you're both scum, and you were trying to look like you were bussing him without actually causing a lynch or putting too much pressure on him.  That's the problem I have with what you did."}

In RVS you all come in and vote someone because they have an amusing avatar. 13 players do this. Because all 13 decide not to post anything which isn't 'fluff' how does the game progress?<br><br>Thus we are concluding fluff posting in RVS is productive and in fact pro-town.

He then theorizes that Zeb and Boon are both scum, but rather than voting one of them like a townie, he keeps his vote on himself.  He then posts nonsense, votes MonkeyMan for no apparent reason, comments on other wagons, and tries to get other people to join his completely unexplained wagon.  He follows this up by... making a post I don't understand (#92) about randomidget's posting.  I genuinely have no idea what he was trying to say with the \"lethe gallery\" thing, so if anyone wants to explain...<br><br>tip doesn't contribute any content, and is promptly jumped on by House and then randomidget for his active lurking.  He then posts more fluff and cross-votes randomidget - very shortly after a wagon against random begins to gather weight (ploben hops on).  I really don't like that he jumped into the third spot on a bandwagon which looked like it might have been gathering momentum at the time.<br><br>tip then claims that he was actually pointing out bad play and scumreads (which he obviously wasn't), and suggests that House and pisskop (the latter of whom questioned House's scumread of tip) are scum together.  As I have come to expect from tip, there is no actual justification, and he doesn't bother to vote either of them.<br><br>tip contributes nothing of value until #258, where he attacks Zebulin - quoting the very post in which Zebulin voted him.  This is becoming a pattern - tip is far, far too defensive.  Then tip posts a magnificent timeline, in which I can find no flaw.<br><br>Tip then does not post until #363, then accuses Kaboose of pushing the same argument without justifying it while being inactive.  Does this remind you of anything?  tip then posts more fluff and continues his non-debate with randomidget about who intimidated the other one, then doesn't post until... ever, actually.  That's all he's done.<br><br>All in all, my first reaction would be \"okay, he clearly doesn't care about this game,\" but then I noticed how emotional he seemed when he reacted to people voting him.  TL;DR I think tip's slot is most likely scum, not because he active-lurked but because he reacted very strongly to anyone voting him.  I feel like he dropped out because he knew he was doing a poor job of covering up his alignment, although this is pure gut feeling.<br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: tip's slot</span><br>In light of this, I'm wary of the randomidget wagon because I'm fairly certain that at least one mafioso is on it.  However, something I'm not sure people have realized: <span style=\"font-style: italic\">We're running out of time.</span>  We need to agree on a lynch - the deadline is in two days.  This is an appeal to townies - please don't let the day go by without lynching.  We need the chance of catching scum, and the information the lynch will give us.

He let's the town stall, and he doesn't have post full of content for anything except defending himself or lashing out at the in-game attackers (mainly me and Ponystar). While the low content could just be a player not that intrested in the game, the huge jump in effort when he's the most pressured player in the game strikes me as really suspicious. He also has used strawman defenses on numerous occasions, mainly toward Ponystar (\"This player's stupid, so all her points are invalid!\") and tunnels the players on his wagon.<br><br>Very Town:<br>Town: <span style=\"color: #00BF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Ponystar17, Kaboose</span></span><br>Leaning Town: <span style=\"color: #40BF40\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Slandaar, Boonskiies, curiouskarmadog</span></span><br>Null: <span style=\"color: #808080\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">randomidget, House, pisskop, BlueBloodedToffee</span></span><br>Leaning Scum: <span style=\"color: #FF8000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">MonkeyMan576</span></span><br>Scum: <span style=\"color: #FF0000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">ploben, tip </span></span><br>Very Scum:"}

I'll be able to catch you out eventually if you are scum, but it will be an over time thing. I see no reason not to town read you right now, and no reason to necessarily push you without anybody having flipped yet. You are easy to just town read, and even easier to start scum reading."}

I'm not mentioning tip as much because I'd just be saying the same thing over and over again.  I do think it's as good of a wagon as the ploben one and better than the MonkeyMan one, there's just more new posts and more new things I've noticed from those two.<br><br>With regards to the reaction test, I was trying to make agreeing with the tip wagon as threatening as possible to scum!karma.

I'm not saying it was a good move, and I am sorry.  It was the wrong thing to do in hindsight - I shouldn't have done it.  The first part of this sentence is explanation, I am not trying to excuse my poor judgement.<br><br>Posturing?  No, I'm just not vote-hopping willy-nilly.

The way mafia can spin a town hating them to its favor is OMGUS the townie (or see the townie coming and accuse him/her first) and fill the pages with lots of filler text no one but the accused quite understands.

I'm not mentioning tip as much because I'd just be saying the same thing over and over again.  I do think it's as good of a wagon as the ploben one and better than the MonkeyMan one, there's just more new posts and more new things I've noticed from those two.<br><br>With regards to the reaction test, I was trying to make agreeing with the tip wagon as threatening as possible to scum!karma.
