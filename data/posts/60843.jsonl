Possible reasons why:<br>\na) He actually, genuinely wants to warn us that he thinks Boonskiies is completely insane as VT, and the town is better off if he's lynched, regardless of alignment.  Possible but seems unlikely when Boonskiies hasn't done anything to warrant the meta-warning yet.<br>\nb) Zebulin is scum and wishes to encourage a lynch of Boonskiies, who he knows is town.<br>\nc) They're both scum and he was trying to provide an excuse for any later mistakes by Boon.<br>\nd) I'm overanalyzing random chatter from this stage of the game.<br>\nAll of these are possible.  Personally, I suspect Zebulin because he seems outright manipulative already - he's trying to affect how we look at Boonskiies when we've barely even started.<br>\n<br>\nAlso, a point to do with your post that confused me, Zeb: wouldn't tunneling him because you think he's anti-town produce the same negative result as it did in that previous game, since a town-flip by him would inevitably implicate you?

Look at Zeb's reaction.  You can't force someone to claim by saying you're pushing for a claim, not a lynch - it destroys the pressure of being at L-1.  Is this just a poor excuse from BBT to try and avoid responsibility if Zeb flips town?  There are plenty of pro-town reasons for not wanting to claim, as Zeb pointed out.  I'm not saying that Zeb is necessarily town - this doesn't really affect my view of him - but BBT's stated intent to force a claim seems very fishy to me.  Care to share your reasons, BBT?

I... would also like to point out that your third \"associative tells\" scumread is the last person who was pressuring me, although I do agree with you on Slandaar being suspicious.  Still, considering he was trying to make a case against me, it would be awfully convenient if he got lynched.

If you really did want to see whether or not Zeb would claim when pressured, why destroy the pressure by admitting to pushing for a claim?  I do also agree that if we're going to force someone to decide whether or not to claim today because we plan to lynch them, it's better to do it earlier rather than later, but I present to you a scenario which could have happened (as a result of us pressuring someone who we had no idea whether we were actually going to lynch at the end of the day).<br>\nZeb claims PR (doctor, cop, tracker, whatever).  People aren't entirely convinced, but they find someone else who they'd rather lynch.  Then Zeb is nightkilled and flips PR.

I think I said that I <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">don't</div> - I just find it very, very strange that you ruined your own attempt to pressure Zeb halfway in.  Early pressure is all well and good, but my impression from your attempt was that you were trying to look like you were pressuring Zeb.

He then theorizes that Zeb and Boon are both scum, but rather than voting one of them like a townie, he keeps his vote on himself.  He then posts nonsense, votes MonkeyMan for no apparent reason, comments on other wagons, and tries to get other people to join his completely unexplained wagon.  He follows this up by... making a post I don't understand (#92) about randomidget's posting.  I genuinely have no idea what he was trying to say with the \"lethe gallery\" thing, so if anyone wants to explain...<br>\n<br>\ntip doesn't contribute any content, and is promptly jumped on by House and then randomidget for his active lurking.  He then posts more fluff and cross-votes randomidget - very shortly after a wagon against random begins to gather weight (ploben hops on).  I really don't like that he jumped into the third spot on a bandwagon which looked like it might have been gathering momentum at the time.<br>\n<br>\ntip then claims that he was actually pointing out bad play and scumreads (which he obviously wasn't), and suggests that House and pisskop (the latter of whom questioned House's scumread of tip) are scum together.  As I have come to expect from tip, there is no actual justification, and he doesn't bother to vote either of them.<br>\n<br>\ntip contributes nothing of value until #258, where he attacks Zebulin - quoting the very post in which Zebulin voted him.  This is becoming a pattern - tip is far, far too defensive.  Then tip posts a magnificent timeline, in which I can find no flaw.<br>\n<br>\nTip then does not post until #363, then accuses Kaboose of pushing the same argument without justifying it while being inactive.  Does this remind you of anything?  tip then posts more fluff and continues his non-debate with randomidget about who intimidated the other one, then doesn't post until... ever, actually.  That's all he's done.<br>\n<br>\nAll in all, my first reaction would be \"okay, he clearly doesn't care about this game,\" but then I noticed how emotional he seemed when he reacted to people voting him.  TL;DR I think tip's slot is most likely scum, not because he active-lurked but because he reacted very strongly to anyone voting him.

He then posts nonsense, votes MonkeyMan for no apparent reason, comments on other wagons, and tries to get other people to join his completely unexplained wagon.  He follows this up by... making a post I don't understand (#92) about randomidget's posting.  I genuinely have no idea what he was trying to say with the \"lethe gallery\" thing, so if anyone wants to explain...<br>\n<br>\ntip doesn't contribute any content, and is promptly jumped on by House and then randomidget for his active lurking.  He then posts more fluff and cross-votes randomidget - very shortly after a wagon against random begins to gather weight (ploben hops on).  I really don't like that he jumped into the third spot on a bandwagon which looked like it might have been gathering momentum at the time.<br>\n<br>\ntip then claims that he was actually pointing out bad play and scumreads (which he obviously wasn't), and suggests that House and pisskop (the latter of whom questioned House's scumread of tip) are scum together.  As I have come to expect from tip, there is no actual justification, and he doesn't bother to vote either of them.<br>\n<br>\ntip contributes nothing of value until #258, where he attacks Zebulin - quoting the very post in which Zebulin voted him.  This is becoming a pattern - tip is far, far too defensive.  Then tip posts a magnificent timeline, in which I can find no flaw.<br>\n<br>\nTip then does not post until #363, then accuses Kaboose of pushing the same argument without justifying it while being inactive.

That's all he's done.<br>\n<br>\nAll in all, my first reaction would be \"okay, he clearly doesn't care about this game,\" but then I noticed how emotional he seemed when he reacted to people voting him.  TL;DR I think tip's slot is most likely scum, not because he active-lurked but because he reacted very strongly to anyone voting him.

Not sure how that makes him scum either.<br>\n<br>\nAt the time I posted it, I think Tip was town from his latest couple of posts. It could have come from scum (if he enjoys playing as scum) but I got a townie feel from them, especially the post about really wanting to play. Since then, you only have to look at the speed of Tip's wagon and the people on it to see that he is town. I will go into a little more detail in my next post.<br>\n<br>\nAlso, please join my Ploben wagon. We have 20+ pages of information, that is more than enough for D1.

He let's the town stall, and he doesn't have post full of content for anything except defending himself or lashing out at the in-game attackers (mainly me and Ponystar). While the low content could just be a player not that intrested in the game, the huge jump in effort when he's the most pressured player in the game strikes me as really suspicious. He also has used strawman defenses on numerous occasions, mainly toward Ponystar (\"This player's stupid, so all her points are invalid!\") and tunnels the players on his wagon.<br>\n<br>\nVery Town:<br>\nTown: <div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF00\">Ponystar17, Kaboose</div><br>\nLeaning Town: <div style=\"display:inline;color:#40BF40\">Slandaar, Boonskiies, curiouskarmadog</div><br>\nNull: <div style=\"display:inline;color:#808080\">randomidget, House, pisskop, BlueBloodedToffee</div><br>\nLeaning Scum: <div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF8000\">MonkeyMan576</div><br>\nScum: <div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF0000\">ploben, tip </div><br>\nVery Scum:", "time": "Mon Mar 09, 2015 3:58 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=60843&start=650", "forum": "53", "thread": "60843"}

A reaction test? Are you serious? What reactions where you trying to elicit? <br>\n<br>\nMore posturing to join Ploben wagon as well. Your last few posts have been pretty scummy. More than pretty scummy actually.</div></blockquote><br>\nI believe that one of tip and random is scum because of the way they interacted early on - I find it hard to believe that they're the same alignment.  I can elaborate D2 if you want, but it's 11PM where I am right now and I have to go to bed soon.<br>\n<br>\nI've repeated that I think <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">all three of them are scum.</div>  I've already said before why I think tip is scum, and he hasn't really said anything which doesn't fall under a complaint I've had about him before.  I'm not mentioning tip as much because I'd just be saying the same thing over and over again.  I do think it's as good of a wagon as the ploben one and better than the MonkeyMan one, there's just more new posts and more new things I've noticed from those two.<br>\n<br>\nWith regards to the reaction test, I was trying to make agreeing with the tip wagon as threatening as possible to scum!karma.  Obviously it didn't work - they noticed, which makes it a failed reaction test regardless of alignment (and not something I'll be trying again this game).  I'm not saying it was a good move, and I am sorry.  It was the wrong thing to do in hindsight - I shouldn't have done it.  The first part of this sentence is explanation, I am not trying to excuse my poor judgement.<br>\n<br>\nPosturing?  No, I'm just not vote-hopping willy-nilly.  I'd feel pretty ridiculous if I just hopped back and forth for no reason, and I think both are equally valid.  I said I'd go for the one with more votes at the end of the day and I'm sticking with it.<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: ploben</span><br>\nL-1.

If the scumread seems town throughout the argument, then the argument drops. If the scumread seems like mafia, then he's probably mafia. Town versus mafia arguments tend to focuse around hard evidence like lies or obvious scumtells, and both sides are desperately trying to get the other lynched. The way mafia can spin a town hating them to its favor is OMGUS the townie (or see the townie coming and accuse him/her first) and fill the pages with lots of filler text no one but the accused quite understands.
