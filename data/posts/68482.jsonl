You may not talk about this game outside of this thread or any Private Threads created for this game.<br>\n3. Please remain civil with each other. Things can get heated or intense, but there are several things that will NOT be tolerated. Absolutely no offensive comments or slurs based on race, gender, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, etc. I WILL force replace you.<br>\n4. <div style=\"display:inline;color:#0040FF\">This is my color (Blue).</div> Please don't use this color or attempt to impersonate me in any way. Any other color is fine as long as it isn't too close.<br>\n5. Do not quote or pretend to quote any role PM, anything from a private thread, or mod communication. You can loosely paraphrase, but please use common sense.<br>\n6. Pretending to break a rule can result in the same action being taken as actually breaking the rule.<br>\n7. Do not try to manipulate or trick the mod.<br>\n8. Any minor/simple questions or pointing out errors in vote counts can be pointed out in thread by leading with a bolded <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">@MOD</div> at the start of a line.<br>\n9. Any more sensitive questions can be PM'd to me. Don't hesitate to ask if you have a question, you will not bother me.<br>\n10. If your spot in the game has been compromised due to outside information, please PM me immediately without making any more posts. I will be eternally grateful for your honesty.<br>\n11. I am not perfect. If you notice anything that is incorrect, let me know.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Voting</div><br>\n<br>\n1. Voting must be made using the vote tags <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Clumsy</span> or using bold. I greatly prefer the vote tags though.<br>\n2. Any other variation will not be counted. I will let you know in thread once (if I notice it), but only once.<br>\n3. Misspellings, acronyms, and abbreviations will be valid as long as it is clear who you are voting for. If I perceive it as a vote, it is a vote.<br>\n4. Any votes within spoiler tags or otherwise concealed will not be counted.<br>\n5. A lynch will occur when 50%+1 of the votes are cast for the same player; a No Lynch will occur when 50% of the votes are cast for that option or when there is not 50%+1 majority by deadline. When this has happened, any subsequent votes and unvotes will not be counted, and the game will enter twilight.<br>\n6. You may continue talking after a lynch or deadline has elapsed until the mod posts to end the day. After that, you may not post even if the mod forgets to lock the thread.<br>\n7. I will try to provide vote counts on a regular basis, with exception to the times when I am at work (which varies). You may request a new vote count at any time, and I will post it at my earliest convenience.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Activity/Day Night</div><br>\n<br>\n1. Days will last two weeks. Deadline extensions will be granted only for the case of replacements, holidays, or other extreme circumstances.<br>\n2. Night phases will last for 2 days (48 hours)<br>\n3. Replacement during night phase will extend the deadline to 24 hours past the point of the replacement, whether that slot has a night action or not.<br>\n4. Actions must be PM'd to me or bolded in the Scum PT for it to be accepted. If no action is selected, they will not perform an action.<br>\n5. If mafia have powers other than their factional night kill, they may perform their power and the kill at the same time.<br>\n6. Prods will be sent out after 48 hours of inactivity. These will be announced in thread. At player request (if reasonable), I can \"Poke\" another player. This will not count as a prod.<br>\n7. If a player does not respond IN THREAD within 24 hours or receives 3 prods, they will be replaced out. If they return before a replacement is found, they may keep playing. The next time they are prodded, however, they will be replaced and can not return.<br>\n8. If you will be unable to be active in thread for over 48 hours, please make a V/LA post in bold. As long as the time is reasonable, you will be exempt from prods.<br>\n9. Once you are dead, you may no longer post in thread.

IIRC I've replaced into two/three games and there was prob one Newbie game started from scratch. Replacement slots don't enjoy the luxury of RVS - now, judging that I RVS'd in a single game a year ago is a clear pattern in my play and that my lack of RV is a glaring spot is overdrawn. <br>\nre: my reasoning - I did word that poorly. My <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8369692#p8369692\">83</a> gave a more boring but clear view on how I see \"random.\" Long story short - IMO, RVS feels more like a Day 1 ritual and the \"random\" part mostly is up to one's interpretation.

I don't like his take on the Blix situation since he claims that he felt Blix's vote for Omega is pro town. I personally don't see how he comes to that conclusion since Blix sure didn't seem like he voiced that well, the simple one-liners Blix gave with his vote doesn't give me that indication at all. If Blix really felt concerned about the question not being answered, he would have added a little more meat with his vote for the rest us to chew on. I also don't like how he brought up his meta, as if he has a unique play style.

I don't like his take on the Blix situation since he claims that he felt Blix's vote for Omega is pro town. I personally don't see how he comes to that conclusion since Blix sure didn't seem like he voiced that well, the simple one-liners Blix gave with his vote doesn't give me that indication at all. If Blix really felt concerned about the question not being answered, he would have added a little more meat with his vote for the rest us to chew on. I also don't like how he brought up his meta, as if he has a unique play style. Looking at both sides or playing neutral seems like something everyone is suppose to do as a player.</div></blockquote></div></div></div><br>\n<br>\nI have used one-line reasoning several times as both town and scum.

The purpose was just to get people to interact with me so I can sort of get a feel for who they're as a person. I like knowing what personality types I'm playing with so I know if I'm in for a long ride or not.<br>\n<br>\nAs for Kage, he is right behind Blix and Martha on my scum list right now. I don't like his take on the Blix situation since he claims that he felt Blix's vote for Omega is pro town. I personally don't see how he comes to that conclusion since Blix sure didn't seem like he voiced that well, the simple one-liners Blix gave with his vote doesn't give me that indication at all. If Blix really felt concerned about the question not being answered, he would have added a little more meat with his vote for the rest us to chew on. I also don't like how he brought up his meta, as if he has a unique play style. Looking at both sides or playing neutral seems like something everyone is suppose to do as a player.</div></blockquote>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8371730#p8371730\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8371730#p8371730\" data-post-id=\"8371730\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 129</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=28563\">Blix900</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8369645#p8369645\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8369645#p8369645\" data-post-id=\"8369645\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 77</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=27496\">kagesong</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8369554#p8369554\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8369554#p8369554\" data-post-id=\"8369554\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 74</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=23679\">JarJarDrinks</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8369458#p8369458\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8369458#p8369458\" data-post-id=\"8369458\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 73</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=27496\">kagesong</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8369356#p8369356\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8369356#p8369356\" data-post-id=\"8369356\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 71</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=23679\">JarJarDrinks</a> wrote:</cite>So I actually forgot this but kage, YOU were the one that originally pointed out that Blix should have saw the preview.

I point out both pros and cons.<br>\n<br>\nRight now, you seem to be attempting to corner Blix on something rather insignificant. That is a scum tell to me. You have driven it hard. If I had not considered making similar posts, I would probably fall for your trap. However, I see right through. My vote is stuck.</div></blockquote>\n\nThis whole response seems very scummy to me at this point in the thread. Although Sage is attempting to \"clear\" my name and I support that, he is changing his story after clearly pointing out that he was reading me (acting pro-town) as town. Sage then flips and states that JarJar looks scummy now in his eyes. That is another scum tell to me, flipping your suspicion onto someone accusing you of being scummy.</div></blockquote>\nLet me clarify this ONE MORE TIME. Pro-town does not = townread. Scum can do things that are pro-town and vice versa. Doing something pro-town does NOT make me town read you. I never made a read on you at all.

The purpose was just to get people to interact with me so I can sort of get a feel for who they're as a person. I like knowing what personality types I'm playing with so I know if I'm in for a long ride or not.<br>\n<br>\nAs for Kage, he is right behind Blix and Martha on my scum list right now. I don't like his take on the Blix situation since he claims that he felt Blix's vote for Omega is pro town. I personally don't see how he comes to that conclusion since Blix sure didn't seem like he voiced that well, the simple one-liners Blix gave with his vote doesn't give me that indication at all. If Blix really felt concerned about the question not being answered, he would have added a little more meat with his vote for the rest us to chew on. I also don't like how he brought up his meta, as if he has a unique play style.

He was met with unsolicited responses in my absence and while he did come off defensive, he provided some reasoning and conceded that the questioning on twoface for \"answering for Jean\" was poorly worded. I recognize that exchange so far as an effort to make conversation and allow for more reads. I do agree on how the type of conversation debating \"why/why not RVS?\" can lead to a series bland and distracting posts.<br>\n<br>\nEarlier on, Twoface opted againt RVS by flipping a coin (no one really knows if he did it or rigged it so he could get a tail). Save The Dragons, shannon, kage - they touched on flavour by the mod and a good chunk of players threw \"random\" votes. Each player has their own idea and style of generating activity.<br>\nI admit that I was in a somewhat funny mood when I explained my non-RVS stance but if you were to remove the sarcasm filter - I am skeptical of RVS because I question the true \"randomness\" in votes. We were given randomized roles already so why binge on randomness? There is also a general tendency to frown upon extended RVS and haphazard play.<br>\n<br>\n@Uzi<br>\nRe: Blix and his vote without preview and all, do you find his vote and following responses scummy?

IIRC I've replaced into two/three games and there was prob one Newbie game started from scratch. Replacement slots don't enjoy the luxury of RVS - now, judging that I RVS'd in a single game a year ago is a clear pattern in my play and that my lack of RV is a glaring spot is overdrawn. <br>\nre: my reasoning - I did word that poorly. My <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8369692#p8369692\">83</a> gave a more boring but clear view on how I see \"random.\" Long story short - IMO, RVS feels more like a Day 1 ritual and the \"random\" part mostly is up to one's interpretation. Also, I have little experience with actually living in the moment of RVS (replacement games) so my opinion may clash with a sort of MafiaScum mantra or tradition, if you will<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>ChaosOmega wrote:</cite>While I have you on the line...<br>\n<br>\nYour two main content posts are <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8366811#p8366811\">43</a> &amp; <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8367638#p8367638\">49</a>. 43, you vote Uzi pressuring him for reads, but he had just posted <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8366648#p8366648\">39</a>.

It's not a strong point, and the reasoning is somewhat specious, but he just lets it go in an off-handed sort of way.

The read on Blix that I had to drag out kicking and screaming is lame. \"seemingly lurking\", \"seems sus\", \"I'm giving time and see how his new post turns out\", \"Would rather give time for him to respond (if he ever does, hope he breaks the lurking) than put him at L-1.\" Everything seems, no reasoning, and he's holding back waiting to see how everything plays out.

Is he scum or is the wagon scum to you?</div></blockquote>\n\nHas nothing to do with that. Logic would state that the strongest push on a townie is a scum. However, scum knows that, so backs off a bit, without relieving any pressure. The scummiest person on my wagon, IMO, UP TO THAT POINT, was JarJar. However, the way he is processing seems legit-town. Jean is at L-2 if I count right. I am okay with that lynch. Is anyone opposed to putting him at L-1</div></blockquote>\n\nI disagree with the point you make about logic - a townie could be incorrectly pushing hard on another townie. This is the best thing, from scum's perspective, because they can just sit back and watch the wagon and not have to do anything themselves. An all-town wagon is a fantastic thing for scum, especially if at least one of the townies is super enthusiastic about it. Even better if both scum are off the wagon, then they can get some faux town cred D2 by pointing fingers at the wagoneers. <br>\n<br>\nI need to re-read Jean, I'm not comfortable with L-1 on anyone at this point.", "time": "Fri Sep 30, 2016 7:31 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=68482&start=325", "forum": "53", "thread": "68482"}

They have to decide when and how to lie. Are they making a scumread on a townie? They're lying. Are they saying someone who is lurking is playing that way because they're scum? If they're not, they know its a lie. When someone tells a lie in a game of mafia they have a filter in their head that's asking \"should I tell the truth here?\" And sometimes they decide \"no\" in absolutely stupid, asinine, ridiculous circumstances. Places where it shouldn't even matter at all. The lie itself might mean absolutely nothing.<br>\n<br>\nBut they have that filter. JeanDarc has that filter.

{"number": 429, "id": "8380662", "user": "Lil Uzi Vert", "user_id": "28406", "content": "Was suppose to post a reads list last night, fell asleep. Been a struggle to keep up with this game but I'm going to do my best from here on out. <br>\n<br>\nHere we go:<br>\n<br>\nBlix: Still don't buy that he didn't see the preview before posting. It's just really odd he would lie about not seeing it unless he's scum. I see no problem with following the reasoning at the time for the Omega vote if you're town and are not sure what to do. But scum, as we all know,  have plenty of reasons to lie about something like that so early on in the game. I don't like that he voted for himself in order to try to prove a point. It comes off as frustration but it definitely could have been a cry for sympathy in order to get some of the heat off him. He also hasn't been too active since he got ran up on and has just done more following rather than present his own reasons for voting so he's my second highest scum read right now.<br>\n<br>\nChaos Omega: He's been tunneling Jean all game and so far that's fine, as it hasn't been done in a way that prevents town from getting anything done. I like the case he presented for Jean and would vote for Jean if he was my highest scum read. Other than that though I'd like to see more of his thoughts on other players before feeling really confident about his alignment. Null-town for me. <br>\n<br>\nEager: I didn't like how he opened since it implied that he wasn't going to put any effort in and he even admitted that he might not do so since he stated that he didn't read the first 8-9 pages. But ever since then, he has been the complete opposite. He's attacking anything or anyone he may find scummy and looks like he's truly trying to figure out who's scum. I didn't agree with some of the things he's chose to pick at but it definitely goes with his approach to the game when he said that everyone is scum until you find a reason on why they most likely aren't. He's my second highest town read right now but something he said about knowing who is scum is pinging me still. It's like he openly admitted to bussing. I can find the quote if anyone would like me to.<br>\n<br>\nJar: Pressures and pressures often. I agree with a lot of the connections he's made so far this game and he seems to be very aware of how easily he can sway the town as he often back peddles when he sees a wagon has grown too quickly or his read on a player may have changed based on their responses. Just like Eager, I believe he's truly trying to solve the game. Highest town read right now. <br>\n<br>\nJean: My eye has been on him since page 1 but I've reread his iso and I don't know what to think of him now. His vote on me I didn't mine at all but it doesn't really help me get an idea for his alignment at all which is worrying since it wasn't an RVS vote. As I've said earlier, Omega presented a good case on him but while rereading Jean's explanation for his views on RVS he pointed out that he hadn't played in over a year on here and that he has some offsite experience that had changed his view on RVS. This seems plausible as I'm still quite new to the site myself and this is the first place I've been too that prefers it so I can see why he would defend his views here. Something about the explanation though seems overboard but I'm unsure if this is a personality trait or an act. Need to see more from him.  Null leaning scum for me. <br>\n<br>\nKage: My highest scum read. Starts off with pointing out the obvious lie that Blix is trying to pass off as truth and then does a complete 360 in a matter of seconds and defends Blix except his defense doesn't take into account any of the reasons that Blix had been voted for. To me here it seems like he was trying to defend his scum partner. Shortly after he brings up his play style when no one asked about it, and keeps trying to hammer it home that it's unique. He keeps trying to say that his definition of playing neutral means taking everything into account but that doesn't make sense because that is what someone who is town is suppose to do so calling it that is really weird but justifying it is scummy in my opinion. Playing neutral seems code word here for information or thoughts and views he won't share with the town. The latter is anti-town but I don't feel it's the latter but the former just from the overall vibe his posts explaining it gives off. <br>\n<br>\nLowell: Uh 8 posts, not much to go off here. I don't agree with his assessment on Omega but I can see how one would think that of Omega based on how he opened. Shannon doesn't come off as careful to me but something does seem off about her so I do share a similar view there. After that though it's just stating he agrees with X post and without any explanation for why he does. Null for me. <br>\n<br>\nMartha - Null leaning scum for me. She seems to have a hard time presenting her thoughts and ideas and her reasoning for this doesn't completely sit well with me as she says she's just complicated without giving a reason why. I don't know if this is due to how she thinks or if she's so obsessed with the celebrity she's a big fan of and is acting as that person on here. I really don't like that she has been throwing shade all over the place though but I don't think how's she doing it is being done very well, it might be that she just thinks out loud and blurts it out without thinking. So far, she's easily the most confusing player in this game and is very hard to read. <br>\n<br>\nSave The Dragons: We seem to share a lot of the same reads on a few players and he has asked a few questions and provided some thoughts of his on but not enough for me have him as town yet. Null for now <br>\n<br>\nShannon: I don't agree with her assessment of Martha's play. Her posting gives off vague vibes but I don't see how she was trying to move attention from anyone. No one was seriously bring looked at other than Blix at the time. Most of the action was Jar Jar questioning Blix which means while there was attention on him, there wasn't much since various members of the town was concerned about other things. She gives a case for Blix not being scum earlier in the game by asking what would be his motivation for lying. I'm going to counter and say he could be trying to get other players to feel that he's being nitpicked for something silly and thus trying to make cases against those players bring scum for that reason. Null for me here but I can't shake off a gut feeling I have about her.<br>\n<br>\nThor: Null. Just replaced in for ThinkBig so a big question mark for me. Votes Kage though and says Two Face is town based on what he read. Would like to see how he came to these two conclusions<br>\n<br>\nTwoFace: Asks a lot of questions which is good and just like me doesn't seem to agree with what Eager chooses to question but takes it a step further by stating various times that he can't see and doesn't understand how Eager reaches his conclusions. The rest of his posts just read null to me though and that's basically because I'm purposely choosing to ignore his coin flip posts. Don't know what to make of them but I assume they are not to be taken seriously. Null leaning town for me <br>\n<br>\nToo long, didn't read:<br>\n<br>\nTown: Eager, Jar<br>\nNull leaning town: Omega, TwoFace<br>\nNull: Lowell, Save the Dragons, Shannon, Thor<br>\nNull leaning scum: Jean, Martha<br>\nScum: Blix, Kage<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Kage</span>", "time": "Sun Oct 02, 2016 5:10 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=68482&start=425", "forum": "53", "thread": "68482"}

It looks like the same thing is starting to happen today, there's a very quick wagon developing. So that's why I'm not joining all of you at this point, even though the D1 vote of our dearly departed makes it the obvious choice at this point. <br>\n<br>\nAlso, 'not necessarily in order' doesn't mean 'in reverse order'.

Replacement slots don't enjoy the luxury of RVS - now, judging that I RVS'd in a single game a year ago is a clear pattern in my play and that my lack of RV is a glaring spot is overdrawn. <br>\nre: my reasoning - I did word that poorly.

I think requesting to replace out of a game and turning around and signing up for a new game should also be against the rules. But it wasn't the replace out that made me scum read him. The replace out is what drew my attention to him and once I did that I read his iso and interactions and they look suspect to me. I am not going to write the replacement out automatically town, that is null but the possibility of him replacing out and making up some non game related reason is a possibility and would thus not be considered part of some scum plan.<br>\n<br>\nyou did sort of say you won't look at titus because you called him town. Typically players don't look at their town reads.", "time": "Wed Oct 12, 2016 7:44 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=68482&start=925", "forum": "53", "thread": "68482"}

I have had her as neutral but thinking about it more, what doesn't make sense in a Scum Titus scenario is why she's come out and defended me today. I guess it *could* earn ScumTitus town points to have defended me (because I'll flip town) but I don't see that being an optimal strategy. It's not like anyone on my wagon is going to be criticised for voting me, after my reading fails. So Titus I think is town.<br>\n<br>\neagerSnake - Snake hasn't really done much since his hammer and subsequent apology. To me, this seems a bit ... unusual. Looking back on his interactions with Jar Jar D1, all I see is dodginess. Then there's the hammer and the weird apology. Leaning scum on this one. <br>\n<br>\nThor665 - I am kind of wondering whether the back and forth with Two Face is a bit of scum theatre? It allows them to look busy but not actually solve the game. If it's not both of them as a team, I'd take Thor as scum. The arguing about semantics and drilling down on minor points reminds me of what he did to me D2, but in that instance it was about Snake and why his hammer made him scum vs. the others on the wagon. Again, it didn't help him solve the game, he just pushed me over some random point. I just think it's busy work. <br>\n<br>\nJarJarDrinks - Town at this point. He seems to be trying to solve the game - questioning people about their reads, asking about motivations, etc. since D1. I like his challenges to Snake over Kage D1. The only thing that really twigs me today is the point he tried to make about me and my Titus read (I thought it was weird she wasn't NKed, then suggested my tinfoil theory that she might be scum). He twisted that to make it look like I was both town and scum reading Titus simultaneously, when actually, it was an evolution in thought. (As in - I thought Titus might have been a target because she's a great player, wonder why she wasn't, maybe it's because she's scum). But - I can see the potential town motivation behind this, he thinks he's trapping Scum Me. So, he's town.<br>\n<br>\nTere (new STD) - Can't get a read based on no content<br>\n<br>\nBlix900 - Have I missed a replacement here? Last I see in Blix's ISO is Saturday. Nothing to go on today.

If I had to choose scum from the active players, it's Thor, and Snake. Are we looking for three scum in this game, or four? If four, my last would have to be the Tere/STD slot just for general shiftiness in timing with replacement. I do take the point, though, that strategic replacement would be bannable. Perhaps he just doesn't like someone in this game, or is feeling uncomfortable?

You're claiming his reads haven't changed, while saying he is scum not calling you scum because now he knows he can't lynch you. But, if he's town, then his read on you...changed. So, the only thing you're calling me wrong on is my conclusion, not on my evidence point. The point is correct - his reads have changed. Now, maybe they're false, but I don't think so and you do, but you can't call that wrong.<br>\n<br>\n7. Well, for starters, I also think Two Face's angle on you being scum is crazy - but that doesn't prove that Two Face is scum. It's fully possible for town to have crazy theories - it happens all the time. The theory scum plan you're attributing to him is complicated and obtuse (and also requires him to functionally be soft double bussing all in order to get you lynched). I see that as an unlikely plan.<br>\n<br>\n8. I'm doing so as a discussion of your belief that he was and is double bussing. If he's double bussing a Goon and, say, a roleblocker, his actions don't make a lot of sense for how he did it on top of the plan being a little odd to even begin with. If he's scum doing what you said, I suppose he did position for a potential mislynch after a buddy lynch, yes. I would suggest that it is also (more) likely that one scum bussed, and another went for an alternate push without an elaborate mislynch/bus scheme.<br>\n<br>\n9.

That was painful <br>\n<br>\nDidn't like how thor downplayed the reasons for jean. Given jeans flip that really stands out. I also think eager looks bad. <br>\n<br>\nTitus called eager town for his stubborn confidence but I've seen town get duped by it. Jake from State Farm comes to mind and so does iranop who just recently won a game using stubborn confidence and was universally townread. <br>\n<br>\nEager has motive to hammer kage if he's scum with jean. Using the lolhammer as an excuse and then that apology for sympathy could very easily be faked. Add in his list read is the worst ever and he's not even trying to help figure out the game. I'd totally be down for a snake wagon. <br>\n<br>\nThor worries me now. He called the jean wagon one based on being a bad player and no scum hunting. He attempts to downplay jean by saying she's a bad player. <br>\n<br>\nAlso he joined the kage wagon after replacing in. Nobody really bats an eye about it either. <br>\n<br>\nI reliaze everyone is town reading thor for some reason but I don't think he should. The hated claim shouldn't factor in cause that can easily be a lie. <br>\n<br>\nAs for blix, he's lurked most of the game and it's hard for me to tell if he's linked to jean. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\nJust another thought. I think I have a theory as to why chaos was killed n2 and not n1 of eager is scum. Eager made a post day 1 that implied he thought chaos was a pr. Assume scum has a RB, they probably blocked him instead of killing him cause he would be the idea doc target. Once watcher flipped, they decided to just kill him. <br>\n<br>\nI play tons of scenarios in my head. I think eager would be a better play. I feel like if I'm somehow alive in lylo, I'm not going through be able to figure him out because he's not contributing and if he is somehow town, nobody is going to kill him.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nSo for now I'm against a Shannon wagon.

I have had her as neutral but thinking about it more, what doesn't make sense in a Scum Titus scenario is why she's come out and defended me today. I guess it *could* earn ScumTitus town points to have defended me (because I'll flip town) but I don't see that being an optimal strategy. It's not like anyone on my wagon is going to be criticised for voting me, after my reading fails. So Titus I think is town.<br>\n<br>\neagerSnake - Snake hasn't really done much since his hammer and subsequent apology. To me, this seems a bit ... unusual. Looking back on his interactions with Jar Jar D1, all I see is dodginess. Then there's the hammer and the weird apology. Leaning scum on this one. <br>\n<br>\nThor665 - I am kind of wondering whether the back and forth with Two Face is a bit of scum theatre? It allows them to look busy but not actually solve the game. If it's not both of them as a team, I'd take Thor as scum. The arguing about semantics and drilling down on minor points reminds me of what he did to me D2, but in that instance it was about Snake and why his hammer made him scum vs. the others on the wagon. Again, it didn't help him solve the game, he just pushed me over some random point. I just think it's busy work. <br>\n<br>\nJarJarDrinks - Town at this point. He seems to be trying to solve the game - questioning people about their reads, asking about motivations, etc. since D1. I like his challenges to Snake over Kage D1. The only thing that really twigs me today is the point he tried to make about me and my Titus read (I thought it was weird she wasn't NKed, then suggested my tinfoil theory that she might be scum). He twisted that to make it look like I was both town and scum reading Titus simultaneously, when actually, it was an evolution in thought. (As in - I thought Titus might have been a target because she's a great player, wonder why she wasn't, maybe it's because she's scum). But - I can see the potential town motivation behind this, he thinks he's trapping Scum Me.

If I had to choose scum from the active players, it's Thor, and Snake. Are we looking for three scum in this game, or four? If four, my last would have to be the Tere/STD slot just for general shiftiness in timing with replacement. I do take the point, though, that strategic replacement would be bannable. Perhaps he just doesn't like someone in this game, or is feeling uncomfortable? IDK.</div></blockquote>\n\nWe share the same reads on everyone else other than Jar, Titus, and Thor. I'm heavily leaning town on Jar as well as Thor. The only thing preventing it from being a sure thing for me with Jar is that I'm little behind on reviewing Titus' ISO. She seems to really believe what she's been saying and while I'm not sold on what she's selling, I don't think she's scum trying to aggressively push a mislynch, just town with differing views on the current game state. I definitely haven't ruled her out completely though and the bussing theories being thrown out might be worth looking into. <br>\n<br>\nThor and TwoFace's back and forth reads like a personality and play style clash to me but both appear to be trying to solve the game. Thor just seems a lot more relentless then the average player in making sure he understands the motives and thought processes behind who he is questioning. <br>\n<br>\nThe only problem I'm having with Thor is that it seems he wants me dead but is not conveying why he does and it seems clear that he either doesn't want to say why or is waiting for a specific time and/or Blix's replacement to do so. I can't shake the feeling his suspicions are just from paranoia and if they are, I understand. This is a very critical and frightening time right now.<br>\n<br>\nThe question I have for you now is that you seem to have stronger scum reads on Snake and Thor but don't seem to be pushing them. Why? Are you building a case for each of them at the moment?", "time": "Thu Oct 13, 2016 5:22 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=68482&start=1025", "forum": "53", "thread": "68482"}

Maybe 5-6 days if everything goes wonderfully.<br>\nI don't think that's a lot of spare time.<br>\nI also don't think there is any way at all that we meet the magical deadlines I'm theorizing here, and pretty much expect almost every step to take at least twice as long as I'm presuming, or to be an anti-town derp rush.<br>\nSo, yeah, if you think we have ample time - great!<br>\nI very much do not, and my request stands as made.<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8418404#p8418404\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8418404#p8418404\" data-post-id=\"8418404\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 1060</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=28406\">Lil Uzi Vert</a> wrote:</cite>I just figured there was more to it than that but I understand now.

The only thing that really twigs me today is the point he tried to make about me and my Titus read (I thought it was weird she wasn't NKed, then suggested my tinfoil theory that she might be scum). He twisted that to make it look like I was both town and scum reading Titus simultaneously, when actually, it was an evolution in thought. (As in - I thought Titus might have been a target because she's a great player, wonder why she wasn't, maybe it's because she's scum).

If four, my last would have to be the Tere/STD slot just for general shiftiness in timing with replacement. I do take the point, though, that strategic replacement would be bannable.

Earlier when I was looking at the people who voted kage I noticed 3 people I was suspicious of. Shannon, blix, and uzi. I asked them each about it and Shannon response was the worst, blix never responded, and uzi's response I felt was good and I believed him. Also when tere caught up he pointed out some posts uzi made that made him think uzi was town and when I read them myself I got the same feeling. <br>\n<br>\nAs for the not scum hunting comment. Can't believe you are asking me that cause I've already accused you of not really scum hunting. But to answer your question I haven't really noticed if he has or hasn't cause he's not in my lynch pool today. <br>\n<br>\nI'd have to look at the wagon but if scum is hard bussing at the beginning which I still feel is a possibility, then it's possible the other stayed off. Or maybe they were both on early. <br>\n<br>\nHard bussing earns lots of town cred and it's why people do it. Like if Titus is scum, you've been duped and I feel like in lylo if you and Titus were alive, you still wouldn't consider her. <br>\n<br>\nYou really can't make a case for town Titus if you remove the not mafia lynch.

My worry is d2 he seemed self-conscious about not_mafia wagon and how he would look for it. Being particular about not defending it and the comment about \"I know people will see this as distancing\" I like less than just defending or not caring as much how it looked to be honest. D3 less impressive than d1 although I may be a little biased.

Early play is hard to judge but I get a LAMIST sense from. Later, it's the scumreads on shannon, my slot and eagersnake. During eagersnake's d3 which I talked about, tere keeps eager as a scumread quietly but direct effort entirely at others, including a change on thor and then FOS titus.

Although yes missing so much doesn't help that. On the plus side, I do get the impression from her stubbornness that she really does believe in what's she's doing.

Hated claim by scum looks a lot worse if you consider he'd be expected to be policy'd pre-lylo; through his scum-flip, next day would then still be pre-lylo, as no mislynch has happened. Then his partner would have to survive two more days still, which doesn't at all seem like an advantageous position. Which in turns makes the positive vs negative assessment for scum claiming very different since it just seems plain bad instead of a balanced and possibly reasonable choice. If the point is that somehow scum-thor would benefit more from being a guaranteed lynch late-game than a potential early one I really fail to see that, even assuming a very strong scumrole or something like that. In comparison to this, a potentially legitimate counterargument is that scum could claim hated if they expected to somehow get out of the pre-lylo lynch or thought it wouldn't be brought up, but that's a different analysis altogether.<br>\nI think this is a weird oversight for someone scumreading who seemed to take at least few minutes to think about thor and the claim, although to be fair I myself haven't thought it all way through yet either until seeing this \"scum could win before lylo\" which stuck out as a blatant thing that didn't make sense. <br>\nBut with this statement it looked like SHE herself DID seem to give it some thought, which is why the miss and the somewhat shallow conclusion is weird.<br>\nI'm not sure how to reconcile this with all I liked about shannon from my skim.<br>\n<br>\nThors response is rational but maybe a bit defensive, looking back thor seemed to scumread shannon before though I feel this response as treating her as mistaken town. Probably a mistake though given now I think the claim is good for thor.", "time": "Sun Oct 23, 2016 3:59 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=68482&start=1425", "forum": "53", "thread": "68482"}

Hated claim by scum looks a lot worse if you consider he'd be expected to be policy'd pre-lylo; through his scum-flip, next day would then still be pre-lylo, as no mislynch has happened. Then his partner would have to survive two more days still, which doesn't at all seem like an advantageous position. Which in turns makes the positive vs negative assessment for scum claiming very different since it just seems plain bad instead of a balanced and possibly reasonable choice. If the point is that somehow scum-thor would benefit more from being a guaranteed lynch late-game than a potential early one I really fail to see that, even assuming a very strong scumrole or something like that. In comparison to this, a potentially legitimate counterargument is that scum could claim hated if they expected to somehow get out of the pre-lylo lynch or thought it wouldn't be brought up, but that's a different analysis altogether.<br>\nI think this is a weird oversight for someone scumreading who seemed to take at least few minutes to think about thor and the claim, although to be fair I myself haven't thought it all way through yet either until seeing this \"scum could win before lylo\" which stuck out as a blatant thing that didn't make sense. <br>\nBut with this statement it looked like SHE herself DID seem to give it some thought, which is why the miss and the somewhat shallow conclusion is weird.<br>\nI'm not sure how to reconcile this with all I liked about shannon from my skim.<br>\n<br>\nThors response is rational but maybe a bit defensive, looking back thor seemed to scumread shannon before though I feel this response as treating her as mistaken town.

Some lategame posts bordered on AtE-esque, but because she was never seriously threatened there were no clear \"I have to AtE to defend myself\" situations to compare anything to what she did here.<br>\n<br>\nThe closest thing I can see is <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7962124#p7962124\" class=\"postlink\">http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.ph ... 4#p7962124</a> which reminds me of <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8415080#p8415080\">1013</a>.

Remembering the oversight on thor too.<br>\n<br>\nWhat prompted this was when I noticed the whole shannon NK slip thing, to be honest I'm surprised people changed their mind on that wagon, it's pretty dodgy. All of that said, if <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8427178#p8427178\">1214</a> is scum AtE it's masterful. General townplay vs scumplay analysis is hard, the best way to describe her play is shannon lives in Fence City as either alignment which makes things difficult. As far as association goes I don't think she would be scum with titus given she could easily lynch snake or possibly malachite instead of joining that wagon.</div></blockquote>\n\n^^ Yeah that other post you linked to was pretty good, the guy I was targeting there actually ended up self-voting and scum won in 5P.  <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_twisted.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":twisted:\" title=\"Twisted Evil\"> <br>\n<br>\nBut the one you've linked to from this game (1214), is not masterful scum AtE, unfortunately, it's just town blather. As you say, I'm used to being town read in all situations. One of the things I need to get better at is worrying less about being lynched and more about whether town is going to win. Sometimes I set myself up in kind of a noob town or VI role in order to survive, and then when I come out with a correct strategy or a good read, no one believes it.

Just about everyone has been suspected of being my scum partner and just about everyone has scum read me at some point. So when I flip, you're not going to get any insight, really. You'll find no partner defending me (because there isn't one), and no scum faking a bad read on me because pretty well <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">everyone</div> has that same bad read. (Actually I think it's everyone but I'm not going to go back and search the game for my name). As I've said before, all that will happen is you'll find yourself in this position again tomorrow, but with me dead and no more information. <br>\n<br>\nAlso, I'm pretty sure that somewhere earlier in the game another player stuffed up and did dead guy reads, and I called them out and said not to town read them for it because I've done it deliberately as scum. Can you see a world in which I go on to do exactly that, in the very same game, in a way that draws massive attention to myself?", "time": "Wed Oct 26, 2016 1:21 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=68482&start=1750", "forum": "53", "thread": "68482"}

You know your own role. You are the only role that can be trusted 100% in your eyes. You did the right thing by going \"ok so we lynch me and I flip town, what next\". Good tactic.<br>\n<br>\nThe only thing I would say is always check vote status before you vote regardless of alignment, because you made a couple of mistakes not declaring L-2 / L-1 and it's an easy thing for scumfucks like me to jump on. <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\">", "time": "Wed Nov 02, 2016 12:59 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=68482&start=2050", "forum": "53", "thread": "68482"}
