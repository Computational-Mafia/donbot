So remote that its only access from land is via a picturesque winding narrow road. The village had remained remote for years but now was becoming an ideal stop over point for summer tourism. This of course bought a growth to its income and growing economic stability. <br><br> But that was during the summer.  Now, in the middle of the bleak winter, things were gravely different. The road offered only a dangerous and perilous journey through snow and ice and was often blocked to all but the foolhardy. The seas were rough and dangerous often closing the small harbor as huge waves crashed into the outer sea defenses.<br><br>Now on a dark and forlorn night you and the rest of the town council gather to discuss how best to use the summer income to meet the challenges of these bleak winters. As you arrive in the town hall meeting room there is the sound of a gunshot from the floor above. <br><br>Everyone rushes to the first floor where a gruesome sight is discovered. In the dark confined space of the communications and telephone exchange room, slumped over his desk, is the communications technician with a bullet hole in his head. It is also clear that those responsible did not want word to get out as all the communications equipment in the room had been sabotaged and is unusable.<br><br>It seems impossible, but winter is suddenly even darker and colder than before.  Summer plans are forgotten as you realize your very survival is threatened in this bleak isolation.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Player List:</span><br><br>insanity018<br>Sharpest-knife-on-tree<br>Wolfy <strike>Dunhamganger</strike><br>penguin_alien <strike>Ivan</strike><br>VictorDeAngelo<br>Froot Loop<br>Rancid Broderick Drake <strike>DukeC</strike><br>Antihero <strike>HiddenInTheDark lifessavers</strike><br>FakeGod <strike>Jake from State Farm</strike><br>Melmond<br>implosion<br>evilpacman18<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Alive:</span><br><br><div style=\"margin:20px;

Please show me some finished games here where scum on day one used random.org as the reason for the vote.  Your premise is faulty. My making a joke about State Farm and voting tells the same amount of information as indicating use of \"random.org\"  Do something that is contradictory results in the opposite of what you are suggesting.  Actually, anyone run a statistical analysis of day one votes and the # of times \"random.org\" was used and then the # of times said use was done by scum? No?

Firstly, the scum have already bandwagoned onto Dunham. Secondly at the most I believe only two have hopped on.

Since I'm not familiar with this site, much less anyone's voting patterns, so I can only assume implosion is trying way too hard to make a day 1 read. That, coupled with his previous attempts at casting suspicion on others looking scum with very little to go on suggests he's trying to establish himself in the thread if said person(s) do end up scummy and thus throw suspicion off himself. If he hits town, then he has the fallback of referring to their posts as \"anti-town\", thus covering for himself for his mistaken read(s) early into the game. If he is town, then the only thing this does is lower his influence in the thread (and he has plenty of influence as he has already steered the voting to the point where Dunham only needs 2 votes to get lynched)<br><br>2). insanity018. Simply saying \"I see\" based off flimsy reasoning (because that's what it is this early in the game) absolutely reeks of buddying.<br><br>Finally, I'm not changing my vote from Dunhamganger because someone does have to die and with him needing only two more to get lynched it might as well be him unless sentiment changes."}

This is interesting. <br>Now as you your concerning votes<br>86- \"click\" of the current vote count. As in noting it for later to see what where folks might be.

It is in fact a \"comment\" on things, stating the runup I interesting. <br>99- was an expressing displeasure by \"eyeroll\"  of pushing BwBurke whose behavior was disjointed but does not appear to be evasive or manipulative. So he leans protown in by book and pushing such a lynch is silly. Thus the comment of an :eyeroll:<br>105 is a prodding Jake on his statement. His response in turn lead me to reread Dunh and in turn result in my placing my vote as there appeared to be clear evasiveness that I have a hard time finding town engaging in.

They also are out to lower #s against them as much as possible. They are an informed minority.  There purpose is deceive in order to outlast town and live as long as possible. <br><br>Town- what they do by nature is \"search\" and \"survive.\"  The function is to assure that town has more than scum. This is done by surviving as long as possible.  They look out for town survival more than own survival particularly with a standard town role.  They are out to find who is deceptive.   A side note on this is that power roles at times can go beyond as they have a \"evade\" vs survive element to them.  <br><br>If you cannot understand the differences in this I am sorry, they are there.  So no, withholding information is not \"evading\" as it is a tool of searching."}

I was not coming in with expectations, I read it over and saw the things that triggered alarms in my head.  It is worth exploring and see no reason to let him off the hook.

Since I'm not familiar with this site, much less anyone's voting patterns, so I can only assume implosion is trying way too hard to make a day 1 read.

If he hits town, then he has the fallback of referring to their posts as \"anti-town\", thus covering for himself for his mistaken read(s) early into the game.

It would flow less naturally than it did.  <br>No I mean evasion and manipulation in behavior. You argue it is evasive as protecting on a town flip.  Yet, wouldn't such protection draw attention to self. Personally if someone runs up flips town, as town I am okay, what do we learn from the broken egg and if scum, okay now who is next.  If things are so \"hyper-sensitive\" that scum actually engage in such  behavior well ahead of a curve then town must dominate more often than not because that is patently poor play for scum."}

On my homesite Dun would have already been lynched by the time I came back to this thread to explain my vote (IRL stuff).

I literally can't even picture one response which would help believe a player is scummy.</div></blockquote><br>Related, but different. Your point here was that his reaction test probably wasn't genuine because it didn't have a clear purpose; mine was that it was vague. Vagueness refers to a different thing, specifically his phrasing being \"to see if Jake reacted like a member of the mafia would.\" It does not refer to the test not having a clear purpose.<br><br>Point 2: Yes. This is the same point.<br><br>Point 3: This isn't a point that I'm making, it's a transitionary sentence.<br><br>Point 4: Well, this one is actually 3 points that you've lumped into one! In fact these were my main three points (specifically that those three things individually each felt forced). You never called anything forced. Let's take a look at the two posts you referenced:<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5841900#p5841900\" class=\"postlink\">post 34</a>, VictorDeAngelo wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5841709#p5841709\" class=\"postlink\">post 33</a>, BwBurke wrote:</cite>Oh, so we still have pretty much nothing to go on?

That could have a variety of reasons, i.e. you could think it's forced, you could think it's indicative that he isn't actually scumhunting, you could think that he's trying to delay RVS to keep information from being generated. <br>2) They do not touch on either his unvote or his calling it a gambit. My points do!<br><br>So yeah. You just took three of my points, lumped them into one, and then compared the first of those points to two of your posts. We had different reasoning. In fact, even under your framework of me having to react to different material than you in order to be generating original reasons, I *did* generate original reasons.<br><br>Point 5: yeah, they refer to the same post, but you were much more specific. I would actually say the part of that post I was referring to was the second half moreso than the first (as I alluded to earlier in my post).

I know Burke flipping town doesn't look good for me, and if people want to jump on the Burke wagon and find a target I accept there's a reasonable chance I will be run up today and won't last longer in this game.

It's hardly a leap to think you'll repeat your MO. Since so can't seem to cease ramming down the point about how easily and quickly your reads can change (like they did for Burke for instance) the point about you town reading skot currently is irrelevent and does nothing to dissuade me that you won't go after him down the line. <br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>To bring us back to the facts the issue isn't that you didn't jump right before the vigshot and say \"hold up guys, I just realised Burke is town and we need to stop this, unvote, let's lynch Victor\" the fact is however you try to paint you were on the wagon for the same reason (curious that my little statement about this last post didn't merit a response).</div></blockquote><br>I'm not sure what point you're trying to make (or what point you're saying I didn't respond to).

It seems like more of a playstyle thing, i.e. that he's the kind of player who will get involved in pushing a wagon strongly. It could be alignment-based but the kind of eagerness he had when pushing Burke seems to me like just Victor's playstyle in that he would probably be pushing with a lot of vim as either town or scum. <br><br>As for things reading unnaturally: that's probably because my posting schedule's been somewhat erratic.

Or to phrase it another way, good points or questions don't necessary equate to town. What reason is there to believe that those questions are the former rather than the latter?"}

Not only that, but instead of actually voting the person who started her wagon (myself) and has been lurking the entire time...she goes at Jake who's been fairly active. Which leads me to believe she considers him to be more of a threat to her than myself, precisely because I've been lurking. Not only that, but Fruit Loop questioned me first, I didn't respond, he/she moved on and voted Jake. Insanity took the same tack AGAIN, she questioned me, I didn't respond, then she voted Jake. Thus she's my strongest scum read."}

To be clear I agree on reading it again (I think I must have skimmed it the first time) that it is a scummy post (which is different from my read on Victor up till now), mostly because after some recent games I'm very wary of anyone who tries to create such stark dichotomies like the one that would cause him to say \"anyone not voting Burke NEEDS to explain.\" Still, I'm curious why you both neglected to mention anything to this effect after penguin's post.<br>implosion's 268 is dramatic but I agree about 226 too, mainly because I don't like the phrase \"If you can't reconcile that with scum, I don't know what more I can say,\" I don't think reconciling is what we're trying to get at here. In other words, town doesn't look at posts and attempt to explain why they're scummy so much as see that posts are scummy and attempt to convince others how. Saying \"reconcile\" is saying forcing meaning into things that don't necessarily hold those meanings.<br><br>So in the spirit of avoiding dichotomy, instead of figuring out the scum on Burke's wagon, when there could be zero or one, I'll provide this list (again, this is at the time of my reading page 11 and I know we're another 5 pages in now but I think I should reflect the flip of my reads on implosion and Victor) of the most likely to least likely to be scum on Burke's wagon at the time of his death: &lt;insanity, Victor, implosion, penguin&gt;<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">page 12</span><br>meh skimming walls<br>Melmond's post is good<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">page 14</span><br>Something off about Froot Loop. Attack on Jake was super bad and seems noncommittal about other things.<br>HITD: You were just voting implosion then switched to Victor. Do you still think implosion is scum? Are you scum reading them both? Details please.<br>SKOT: what do you mean you prefer Victor? (Specifically under an implosion vote)<br><br>ok I am now caught up, sorry for delays. Last couple pages I mostly confirmed to myself that I am still happy with insanity lynch despite mild reservations which are probably just paranoia.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">vote: insanity018</span>"}

Victor and I went through wall post battles in another game so that is fresh in my mind and I might be letting it sway my choice.  But, it's very weak and nothing concrete on the vote.

There is nobody who was on all three wagons, HITD I think comes closest to not being on any of the wagons. I'm not sure what that means but I had a slight scum read on him already. I could say that him not being on any of these wagons indicates that he's been noncommittal, but that would be editorializing a little. In truth, he's been more tunnelly than anything, with his vote sitting on implosion while only nonchalantly encouraging anyone else to actually vote implosion.<br><br>Speaking of implosion, he perhaps looks worst of everyone on the wagons. He was on the earliest two wagons and didn't feel strongly for or against the third, but expressed intent to hammer.<br>The other person I'm wary of based on the VCs is DukeC who disappeared after kicking off the insanity wagon but was at the head of two different wagons, one that got into lynch territory and one that did go through. Jake, Melmond and SKOT were on both wagons headed by DukeC, potential scumbuddy help from one or both of them. Based on my already formed reads, SKOT sticks out most.<br><br>Just initial thoughts..."}

Second off even if you don't know that it's just reaching to say that scum would lie about being new to gain an advantage.

Explain scum motivation as simply \"elimination\" of town is lazy. Hey, I can be lazy, admittedly. But it really does nothing about the specific action I engaged in which was a reaction to a deflated run up without a claim and the avoidance of claim.  The behavior to me was evasive and did not seem town.  You suggest that I \"knew\" he was town and decided to vote after the wagon fell apart as scum.  This is about as weak sauce as things get in terms of reasoning for suspicions."}

Also assuming scum will all vote together in the event that any townie misvotes. <br><br>There's a difference between making assumptions and scumhunting. Your reasoning on SKOT is fine, because it's backed up in logic. But there is no inherent reason to suspect that scum had a pr read on wolfy. Or that scum shot him for his reads. Or that scum won't bus. Those are all just brute statements. They are quite possibly true, but there are other explanations. The assumption that scum won't bus isn't necessarily a bad thing (it just shows an underlying pattern of you assuming things that have no reason to be assumed). The other assumptions you're making, however, make no sense - scum could have shot wolfy because they thought he was some random pr. Or because they were afraid of his reads. Or because they thought he was the dayvig. Or because they didn't want a relatively fresh replacement to add more input. Or because they wanted to shoot someone who hadn't said much to prevent telling the town too much. <br><br>I would in fact say there is reason to suspect that the reason is *not* because of his reads, because he had been pretty lurky for his time here, so even with accurate reads he probably wouldn't be a large threat (I also have reason to say that because I'm town and I think Victor is town). It's quite possible that it was because they thought he was a PR, but I see no reason to presume that it was.<br><br>As a general rule starting from things like NK analysis or bandwagon analysis is a bad idea. They're a great tool for supplementing direct scumhunting, but they should not be used as a starting point for getting reads. I don't think those assumptions are necessarily scummy either, but they're certainly a bad thing to have."}

It's your call.</div></blockquote><br>I was kinda just going off my town read on Jake for a while so I just went along with FakeGod's assertions of himself but on a second read through, the above comments stood out to me. They may not seem like much but I noticed, after seeing these, that in general FakeGod has a tendency towards manipulation of individual people that I don't think is town-sided. Not only in his interactions with Melmond too, but with me in the conversation about compromise on implosion, he stated, after getting me to switch my vote to implosion, that he didn't have a read on me. It's really scummy then that he was forming associative reads between me and implosion before bothering to read me individually. The stark dichotomy he's set up between me and implosion, where only ONE OF US can be scum is bad enough in itself, (I almost always see scum compartmentalizing people and then treating those divisions as fact, it works its way into the town mindset slowly) not to mention he doesn't seem interested in voting correctly here. In other words, he has a scum read on both implosion and me (post reading my iso) but believes that only one of us can be town, yet is willing to lynch either of us indiscriminately.<br>That apathy seems to me like it's a direct result of his successful diffusion of the SKOT wagon. It's pretty balls to the wall but this is 2014 site meta and white knighting is the new distancing.<br><br>tl;dr: My theory is that FakeGod came in all hard but as soon as he saved his buddy SKOT, he didn't care who we lynch and so is compromising in places where he was previously very self-assured.<br><br>As for implosion, he could still be scum, I think a Fake, SKOT, imp team makes perfect sense, considering implosion's been the most vocal of SKOT-town after FakeGod. HITD/replacement are the only other option I can see to round out that scum team. Oh Victor could be it too, especially if implosion is town.<br><br>implosion, what's your take on FakeGod?<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">vote: SKOT</span><br>I'm going back to this.

We're people, it's gonna happen. But with FG, what's happening is he's using his (maybe-unique-to-you) perspective to draw conclusions that are incorrect and scummy.

Your statement of my \"hunting mislynches\"  as a characterization of my play is poor.  I have done what I do and look at things the way I do.  Now the fact that I have suspected you and EPM is contrary to that. My looking at the votes to try and sort out what scum would do is contrary to that.  Now, sure, it is entirely possible that the things are am reacting to are flawed.  Guess what I am town and I have no inside information.  All I know is what I know of behavior trends and what scum may do voting wise.  I could say that all you are doing is hunting mislynchs. The difference being I made to votes on now known town, you made one. If you ask me the reasoning on my votes versus yours is starkly contrasted as you went for easy lynch bait and I was actually reacting to things for reasons that I tend to react to things for, right or wrong."}

I lurk D1 in a lot of games, it's usually just a combination of figuring things out before I post too much and real life duties, except the thing here is for the most part I was pretty active in this game D1, my voting record is just attributable to me being a conservative voter. Look here, if I actually believed this meant anything, I could say, \"well in that game you were less concerned about petty game theory arguments, and you didn't RVS vote and you didn't argue self-meta defenses all the time\" and you and everyone else would accept it as a reasonable argument against the discrepancies in your gameplay here and there, regardless of whether you would agree with it. But I just made that up on the spot without even skimming your iso and I get the feeling you didn't give my iso in that game much more than a light scan either, this is the exact same conversation your post 725 is related to... it's easy to find style-tells and call them alignment related, but I don't care to do that and don't trust you for doing it.</div></blockquote>fair enough point, fyi, my scans of anything are generally quick, often even of the game itself.  Game theory stuff is stuff I started within the alt while trying to address explaining my thinking.  You won't find any of it in PB conversation period, fyi. The random.org opening vote also something started and won't find with PB.  Self meta comes and goes and maybe just sometimes feels like it is all the time.

I lurk D1 in a lot of games, it's usually just a combination of figuring things out before I post too much and real life duties, except the thing here is for the most part I was pretty active in this game D1, my voting record is just attributable to me being a conservative voter. Look here, if I actually believed this meant anything, I could say, \"well in that game you were less concerned about petty game theory arguments, and you didn't RVS vote and you didn't argue self-meta defenses all the time\" and you and everyone else would accept it as a reasonable argument against the discrepancies in your gameplay here and there, regardless of whether you would agree with it. But I just made that up on the spot without even skimming your iso and I get the feeling you didn't give my iso in that game much more than a light scan either, this is the exact same conversation your post 725 is related to... it's easy to find style-tells and call them alignment related, but I don't care to do that and don't trust you for doing it.</div></blockquote>fair enough point, fyi, my scans of anything are generally quick, often even of the game itself.  Game theory stuff is stuff I started within the alt while trying to address explaining my thinking.  You won't find any of it in PB conversation period, fyi. The random.org opening vote also something started and won't find with PB.  Self meta comes and goes and maybe just sometimes feels like it is all the time. I feel I have to explain myself here as I am alien- And yes, it is possible that I picked on style tells and I am willing to consider you potentially town and my wrong on your take.</div></blockquote><br>who are you willing to lynch then?

Look here, if I actually believed this meant anything, I could say, \"well in that game you were less concerned about petty game theory arguments, and you didn't RVS vote and you didn't argue self-meta defenses all the time\" and you and everyone else would accept it as a reasonable argument against the discrepancies in your gameplay here and there, regardless of whether you would agree with it.

Like the first post in the dump where she's asking me about HITD. It feels like defending-without-really-defending. It feels somewhat more likely scum-&gt;scum than scum-&gt;town. The second post too, the fact that penguin takes time to try to clarify HITD's position. Another smaller interaction that I think is interesting is her interaction towards Froot in 211. It's an interesting way for scum to give a townread, and I want to say that it also looks somewhat scum-&gt;scum, but not strongly. I think SKOT is the one townread I'm not going to compromise on at this point. Beyond that I can't think of anything else that I can't be convinced of at this point.<br><br>I think I want to not-lynch SKOT and Fakegod as a core for now. I like Fakegod's play so far today.

And since it's late and I'm too lazy to dig through your games...never mind, you have no completed games.

Also the end of day one vote by EPM and HITD.  HITD was expecting to get flak for the end of day hammer.  The question I ask is why would town be concerned or even think about that, in that instance.  Also, Jake had alarm triggers going on HITD.  HITD did not seem to be the HITD he is used to. HITD sluffed it off as site differences. Jake was on tilt or off-par and not usual self and bowed out. But I respect jake on that front as well.  HITD was doing a lot of stirring as well imo."}

Froot said she didn't know where to go, epm said he needed to re-evaluate on day two. I also said something similar but the way both of them did that feels waffle-y. Idk, the more I think about this right now the more I think my instinct says froot-epm. <br><br>Melmond if you're still sold on thinking skot is likely scum i'll iso him too (probably more thoroughly). My laptop is almost dead and I'm falling asleep so this is it for now. As long as others are doing/saying things I should have enough motivation this weekend to be active. My motivation in general's been very meh lately for rl reasons."}

Please show me where you think I am holding back. Sharing every detail of what I think is not something I am used to as very little of that goes on where I am from. Sure, that is not verifiable on your end.  My play if you examine it is consistent with my meta. Feel free to read any peacebringer finsihed game, even going back a decade. But no, you won't do that because you are more interested in getting a scum win I think.   I am who I am. I am intuitive. I am not detail oriented. I best express things the way I do and sometimes i cannot even really find the words to describe why I feel the way i do.  <br><br>Now as to you, you have simply engaged in the stardard scum tunnel. you have sat on sidelines making comments about the state of things one way or another. You did the typical scum sit back and jump on end of a lynch at deadline. You have given crap for reads for someone who is read dependent. You gave a faux effort at VCA and only used it to appear to be doing something and to support your tunnel. So either you are really bad town and very anti-town in your play this whole game stuck in confirm bias on an outsider or you are scum. I think you are better then being locked into confbias and your play has equated scum play in other closed games.   <br><br>Now, sure is there the possibility that you are just really that bad a player, maybe. I have tried to look at it from that angle to see if I am just blinded by your tunnell. Sometimes though things are exactly what they appear to be.  Historically folks who tunnel me at this point of game are scum looking to convince others to get an easy lynch and win the game. Melmond is locked in confbias based on his own prejuidice so all scum have to do is convince one more town of me being scum and game will be over.  <br>As to Anti- the very avoidance of this thread and game right now is very suspiscious and seems very scummy. He is active elsewhere. <br><br>I can only do what I know how to do.  As to reads. I have thought Implos leaned town. I thought froot was a typical reaction to me and had null and flipped back and forth on the lean.  HITD had no clue. Anti has done nothing.  Yet, somehow you read this disengaged anti as being town."}

And if one of your teammates starts out the game pointing at and pushing to the point of tunneling the player, would you not perhaps defend. <br><br>R/T Anti- day three read like he came out with a vote for me and was not supposed to as that was EPM\"s tact.  So they had there little back and forth which now is being couched as a misunderstanding. Now with Antihero avoidance of game he comes back and claims to forget about game and had \"Unbookmarked it.\"  That just sounds like an excuse to look lurking town to me. Although now sharing some thoughts."}

Yes, I have tried to convince you of my role and you interpret it as \"trying to seem\" scummy. I can only play how I play and be who I am.  This unfortunately will result in town losing and losing today if I cannot do what I can to convince you and the rest of town of error. I am not very good at such persuasion.   <br><br>You call out my voting record and yes, on surface is lousy.  I wish I had knowledge that would have enable me to appear better, but alas I am simply town. Yes, I agree PR add in evasion to their arsenal. As such, I can tend to pick out \"RPs\" good or bad vs just scum. This has been consistent with me but you have no knowledge of same.   The dunham vote was simply cultural difference.  Victor I thoughts was scum as he played different that a concurrent game and I wrongly viewed town in that game. I had the differences in play right but read the wrong way.  Sadly, I thought his claim was a bit suspect and got hung up on the potential of role distribution.  As to you, I voted you and then backed off. The vote on you was sheeping Jake's view at the time as I know he gets good reads. However, when looking at it I changed my mind, correct?    Insanity vote, I got stuck on the Burke segment and that is a typical day one result.    You can continue to look at what I do and how I react as scummy. You have demonstrated that other people have given you reason to react to me the way you do.  I will be confirmed when flip and when town loses but at least I am making every effort to everythign I know to prevent the error.  Now you may ask if I know the way I play can cause town loss and put in bad position at the end game, why do I do and play the way I do.  I do not know how to be different then how I am.  Just a fact.   Now I wish I could make an arguement about you are EPM being gone if I was part of scum team, but I cannot make that argument given the way things went down.  <br><br>EPM to me does seem like the scum EPM I have encountered before. Maybe that is confirmation bias on my end adn the scum are really implosion and froot loop.  I don't know.  <br>I need to take a bit more to sort that out.

I have no concept how to play the Mafiascum way even after some games of PB and the games here.

And if you want to talk about \"non-committal\" that basically sums up Froot's play all game. Read over your ISO and it is stay in middle of everything. You took no real position and even here was hem and haw until you finally come in with a position. And you come in and push me now because it will get you your scum win."}
