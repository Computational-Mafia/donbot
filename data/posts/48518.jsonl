So remote that its only access from land is via a picturesque winding narrow road. The village had remained remote for years but now was becoming an ideal stop over point for summer tourism. This of course bought a growth to its income and growing economic stability. <br>\n<br>\n But that was during the summer.  Now, in the middle of the bleak winter, things were gravely different. The road offered only a dangerous and perilous journey through snow and ice and was often blocked to all but the foolhardy. The seas were rough and dangerous often closing the small harbor as huge waves crashed into the outer sea defenses.<br>\n<br>\nNow on a dark and forlorn night you and the rest of the town council gather to discuss how best to use the summer income to meet the challenges of these bleak winters. As you arrive in the town hall meeting room there is the sound of a gunshot from the floor above. <br>\n<br>\nEveryone rushes to the first floor where a gruesome sight is discovered. In the dark confined space of the communications and telephone exchange room, slumped over his desk, is the communications technician with a bullet hole in his head. It is also clear that those responsible did not want word to get out as all the communications equipment in the room had been sabotaged and is unusable.<br>\n<br>\nIt seems impossible, but winter is suddenly even darker and colder than before.  Summer plans are forgotten as you realize your very survival is threatened in this bleak isolation.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Player List:</div><br>\n<br>\ninsanity018<br>\nSharpest-knife-on-tree<br>\nWolfy <div style=\"display:inline-flex;text-decoration:line-through\">Dunhamganger</div><br>\npenguin_alien <div style=\"display:inline-flex;text-decoration:line-through\">Ivan</div><br>\nVictorDeAngelo<br>\nFroot Loop<br>\nRancid Broderick Drake <div style=\"display:inline-flex;text-decoration:line-through\">DukeC</div><br>\nAntihero <div style=\"display:inline-flex;text-decoration:line-through\">HiddenInTheDark lifessavers</div><br>\nFakeGod <div style=\"display:inline-flex;text-decoration:line-through\">Jake from State Farm</div><br>\nMelmond<br>\nimplosion<br>\nevilpacman18<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Alive:</div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px;

If I do not receive your choice via PM or bolded in the quick-topic provided by the posted deadline you will forfeit your actions.<br>\n<br>\nAny player with a Night action may instead submit a &#8220;No Action&#8221; PM to let the Mod know that you do not want to perform your expected action that Night phase.<br>\n<br>\nI reserve the right to make any changes to the rules at any time.

Votes will NOT be counted if they are not bold! Obvious abbreviations or nicknames will be counted so long as they are unambiguous.<br>\n<br>\nPlease submit vote revocations as either Unvote: PlayerName or Unvote. Unvotes are not required, but are helpful.<br>\n<br>\nYou may Vote: No Lynch - a simple majority of these vote types are required to send the game to Night phase without a lynch.<br>\n<br>\nThis game will have 2 week deadlines. At deadline, if there is not a simple majority of votes there will be No Lynch.<br>\n<br>\nI will post vote counts as often as possible, at least once a day (excluding possible holidays).<br>\n<br>\nDeadlines may be extended to account for holidays or site disruption.<br>\n<br>\nMiscellaneous/Mechanics:<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#004080\">Dark Blue</div> is my color.

Do not post issues/complaints in the game thread.<br>\n<br>\nI may make mistakes - please point out any mistakes gently. Mistakes will be corrected where possible, but sometimes mistakes are made that cannot be reversed. These will stand as final to be commiserated over after the game.<br>\nPlease bold all requests to the Mod so that they don&#8217;t get missed.<br>\n<br>\nProds of missing players will be issued automatically after 72 hours of no activity or upon request after 48 hours of no activity. A prodded player has 48 hours to respond or risks replacement.

Firstly, the scum have already bandwagoned onto Dunham. Secondly at the most I believe only two have hopped on. The two I suspect of being scum at the moment are implosion and insanity018 based off my own reasoning.<br>\n<br>\n1). Since I'm not familiar with this site, much less anyone's voting patterns, so I can only assume implosion is trying way too hard to make a day 1 read. That, coupled with his previous attempts at casting suspicion on others looking scum with very little to go on suggests he's trying to establish himself in the thread if said person(s) do end up scummy and thus throw suspicion off himself. If he hits town, then he has the fallback of referring to their posts as \"anti-town\", thus covering for himself for his mistaken read(s) early into the game. If he is town, then the only thing this does is lower his influence in the thread (and he has plenty of influence as he has already steered the voting to the point where Dunham only needs 2 votes to get lynched)<br>\n<br>\n2). insanity018. Simply saying \"I see\" based off flimsy reasoning (because that's what it is this early in the game) absolutely reeks of buddying.<br>\n<br>\nFinally, I'm not changing my vote from Dunhamganger because someone does have to die and with him needing only two more to get lynched it might as well be him unless sentiment changes.", "time": "Thu Apr 24, 2014 11:31 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=48518&start=75", "forum": "53", "thread": "48518"}

There purpose is deceive in order to outlast town and live as long as possible. <br>\n<br>\nTown- what they do by nature is \"search\" and \"survive.\"  The function is to assure that town has more than scum. This is done by surviving as long as possible.  They look out for town survival more than own survival particularly with a standard town role.  They are out to find who is deceptive.   A side note on this is that power roles at times can go beyond as they have a \"evade\" vs survive element to them.  <br>\n<br>\nIf you cannot understand the differences in this I am sorry, they are there.

If he hits town, then he has the fallback of referring to their posts as \"anti-town\", thus covering for himself for his mistaken read(s) early into the game.

On my homesite Dun would have already been lynched by the time I came back to this thread to explain my vote (IRL stuff). It's why I was critical of the out of nowhere bandwagoning and why I also simultaneously didn't see the reason for taking my vote off him, once I started getting acclimated to this site's rules. <br>\n<br>\nSo to me, it was perfectly logical given my limited understanding to keep my vote on him. He was at L-2, no one else was getting heat, so he might as well die so the voting and reads for next day could shift to the people who voted for him (or didn't vote him because reasons). Yes, that would include myself.<br>\n<br>\nAlso, does everyone on this site unvote, then immediately revote? No? Then why would you expect me to? Just because I suspect others? There is every possibility that I'm wrong and they turn up townie, so I'm also trying to gather other reads than just those two. Thus my unvote signifies that I'm not sure of my reads and I'm trying to see how the thread progresses in the meantime to give me a better idea. <br>\n<br>\nQuestion, since I'm kind of slow. What do you mean by shift my vote? Do you mean unvote, then revote? Or just unvote? <br>\n<br>\nIf I truly believed someone was scum (or if their lynch was inevitable/bandwagoned) I wouldn't shift my vote, so to assume the natural thing for me to do is shift my vote and hop on a bandwagon reeks of assumption, especially since you've never played with me, I don't know you, and your thinly veiled attempt at shifting suspicion towards myself is bad and you should feel bad.", "time": "Tue Apr 29, 2014 8:22 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=48518&start=225", "forum": "53", "thread": "48518"}

He says we should lynch him because he \"really wants to be lynched.\" It's pushing the easy lynch rather than the scummy individual. It wouldn't be as bad of a post if he said anything scummy at all that Burke had done, even without good reasoning. The setting up of a DukeC push for tomorrow is also sketchy, as SKOT mentioned. Particularly the fact that he phrased it as \"Duke C needs to be looked at tomorrow.\" That phrasing seriously feels like lining up mislynches. <br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5856296#p5856296\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5856296#p5856296\" data-post-id=\"5856296\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 226</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=23314\">VictorDeAngelo</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5856280#p5856280\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5856280#p5856280\" data-post-id=\"5856280\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 224</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=23000\">Sharpest-knife-on-tree</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5856256#p5856256\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5856256#p5856256\" data-post-id=\"5856256\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 222</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=23314\">VictorDeAngelo</a> wrote:</cite><img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_facepalm.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":facepalm:\" title=\"Face, Meet Palm\"> <br>\n<br>\nSharpest did you miss the part where Burke was obvscum?</div></blockquote>\nsure, tell me what world where scum actually engage in that behavior<br>\nHe truly is playing densely, but if he is scum I am a monkey's uncle.</div></blockquote>\n\nCome on, the guys caught and he knows it.

The ISO point is more legitimate but making a legitimate point doesn't make the push any less scummy, given that it seems ostensibly like pure opportunism.

There's absolutely no reason to assume his play fits in with the town win condition (it's you win when all nontown factions are dead in case your role PM didn't have it  <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\">  ) and the reasons to vote him are better than any other player (and if you disagree on this then, once again, make a better case against someone).</div></blockquote>\nThis is also really, really bad. SKOT had given reasons to believe he was town (which were promptly ignored by Victor, in favor of a snide comment). He also debunked your \"reasons to vote him.\" And he did, in fact, make a better case on someone. Namely you. This feels awkward as a defense, in a sense - he's sidestepping the points that SKOT actually made in an attempt to defend himself without addressing them.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nI could probably find some other things but this is plenty.

Let's look at an example: suppose player A votes the leading wagon with some justification. Player B may find player A scummy for having voted the leading wagon despite never having mentioned the player; player C may find them scummy for their justification looking forced or disingenuous; player D may find them scummy for their justification looking illogical; player E may find them scummy for thinking that their vote was opportunistic; player F may find them scummy for having lurked; player G may find them scummy for seeing some inconsistency between the reasoning for their vote and what player G knows of their town meta; and so on and so forth. One piece of information from a player can be interpreted in more than two ways - it can be interpreted as townish for any number of reasons, or scummy for any number of reasons.<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5862270#p5862270\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5862270#p5862270\" data-post-id=\"5862270\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 297</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=23314\">VictorDeAngelo</a> wrote:</cite>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5853177#p5853177\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5853177#p5853177\" data-post-id=\"5853177\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 188</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=14368\">implosion</a> wrote:</cite>WRT the melmond wagon: I have mixed opinions.

Your point here was that his reaction test probably wasn't genuine because it didn't have a clear purpose; mine was that it was vague. Vagueness refers to a different thing, specifically his phrasing being \"to see if Jake reacted like a member of the mafia would.\" It does not refer to the test not having a clear purpose.<br>\n<br>\nPoint 2: Yes. This is the same point.<br>\n<br>\nPoint 3: This isn't a point that I'm making, it's a transitionary sentence.<br>\n<br>\nPoint 4: Well, this one is actually 3 points that you've lumped into one!

That could have a variety of reasons, i.e. you could think it's forced, you could think it's indicative that he isn't actually scumhunting, you could think that he's trying to delay RVS to keep information from being generated. <br>\n2) They do not touch on either his unvote or his calling it a gambit. My points do!<br>\n<br>\nSo yeah. You just took three of my points, lumped them into one, and then compared the first of those points to two of your posts. We had different reasoning. In fact, even under your framework of me having to react to different material than you in order to be generating original reasons, I *did* generate original reasons.<br>\n<br>\nPoint 5: yeah, they refer to the same post, but you were much more specific. I would actually say the part of that post I was referring to was the second half moreso than the first (as I alluded to earlier in my post).

You instead choose to agree with me and get on the wagon. <br>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Burke simply didn't have enough content in the game for people for people to voting him for multiple reasons</div>, full stop. I no qualms turning around today, putting my hands up and saying I pushed for the lynch and he ended up being town. I don't like how desperate you are to dodge responsibility.</div></blockquote>\nTwo things.<br>\n<br>\nOne, I'm not dodging responsibility; I'm claiming that my opinion had changed. I'm certainly still as responsible for the wagon on Burke as anyone else who was on the wagon was.</div></blockquote>\n\nYeah but your not, because putting the burden on my shoulders. In fact solely on my shoulders. I don't see anything in Burke's ISO to suggest he was town. Nor do I see any reason for the sudden revelation that his anti-town was VI instead of scum.<br>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Second, the bolded just isn't true about the game of mafia. Let's look at an example: suppose player A votes the leading wagon with some justification. Player B may find player A scummy for having voted the leading wagon despite never having mentioned the player; player C may find them scummy for their justification looking forced or disingenuous; player D may find them scummy for their justification looking illogical; player E may find them scummy for thinking that their vote was opportunistic; player F may find them scummy for having lurked; player G may find them scummy for seeing some inconsistency between the reasoning for their vote and what player G knows of their town meta; and so on and so forth. One piece of information from a player can be interpreted in more than two ways - it can be interpreted as townish for any number of reasons, or scummy for any number of reasons.</div></blockquote>\n\nSigh, this isn't a theory lesson. There's an actual game with an actual example. I can't be bothered to even try and work out what Player X thinks of Player Y in this example.

Anything else.</div></blockquote>\nAlright, let's look at these.<br>\n<br>\nPoint 1: <blockquote><div><cite>Victor wrote:</cite>Apologies, I should have been clearer. I understand the purpose of a reaction test, what I meant was what specifically did you hope to see? Jake break down and say \"damn, you got me, gg town\" or what? I literally can't even picture one response which would help believe a player is scummy.</div></blockquote>\nRelated, but different. Your point here was that his reaction test probably wasn't genuine because it didn't have a clear purpose; mine was that it was vague. Vagueness refers to a different thing, specifically his phrasing being \"to see if Jake reacted like a member of the mafia would.\" It does not refer to the test not having a clear purpose.</div></blockquote>\n\nWell, I always took vague to mean 'no clear meaning' but that could just be the poor level of English teaching I got at school. <br>\nI guess I'm being generous we could say I took Burke's explanation a step further by equating the vagueness of his answer with the fact his reaction test had not actually been thought through. <br>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Point 3: This isn't a point that I'm making, it's a transitionary sentence.</div></blockquote>\n\nFair enough.<br>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Point 4: Well, this one is actually 3 points that you've lumped into one!</div></blockquote>\n\nApologies I took it at one point (and let's be fair point 4 referred to half a sentence in your original post so lumping together appeared to be your intention). I will dissect further if I have to...<br>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>In fact these were my main three points (specifically that those three things individually each felt forced). You never called anything forced.

Care to talk me through how it works?</div></blockquote>\nYou'll note two things about these posts.<br>\n1) They do not call Burke's play forced; they imply that you think his \"missing RVS ending\" is scummy. That could have a variety of reasons, i.e. you could think it's forced, you could think it's indicative that he isn't actually scumhunting, you could think that he's trying to delay RVS to keep information from being generated. </div></blockquote>\n\nYou're right I don't use the word forced. I guess in future games I need to learn to blunt earlier in the game. I did think his reaction test forced, and I had hoped this pair posts conveyed that. Apparently I failed on that front. I think making rvs statements after rvs is over is not something townies naturally do. If the game has clearly moved past rvs (and in my defence Burke should have really noticed that rvs was done) than any attempt at this sort of rvs is obviously forced. <br>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>2) They do not touch on either his unvote or his calling it a gambit. My points do!</div></blockquote>\n\nI guess you took my second post at face value. No I don't use the word gambit - but my point isn't that we used identical language, it was that your reasons were fundamentally the same as mine. Burke looked like he was faking a gambit. I clearly called him out for it. I left enough room that if he was town he could explain his test <br>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>So yeah. You just took three of my points, lumped them into one, and then compared the first of those points to two of your posts. We had different reasoning. In fact, even under your framework of me having to react to different material than you in order to be generating original reasons, I *did* generate original reasons.</div></blockquote>\n\nSo yeah splitting the point three ways:<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5862270#p5862270\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5862270#p5862270\" data-post-id=\"5862270\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 297</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=23314\">VictorDeAngelo</a> wrote:</cite><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">1</div>His RVS vote's justification as a reaction test feels forced, <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">2</div> his unvote feels forced, <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">3</div> his calling it a gambit feels forced</div></blockquote>\n\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">1</div> - I think it should be clear from the vote and timing that I found the rvs vote forced even if I didn't bother using the actual word.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">2</div> - Again I called him out at the time, just didn't use the word forced.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">3</div> - I didn't use the word gambit either - merely questioned him on the nature of the gambit to see what he would say.<br>\n<br>\nI guess summing these points up as forced play designed to give the appearance of looking townie is taking my original two points a step further. So new yes your post had original content. So Kudos on that I guess.<br>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Point 5: yeah, they refer to the same post, but you were much more specific. I would actually say the part of that post I was referring to was the second half moreso than the first (as I alluded to earlier in my post). So once again, somewhat different points.</div></blockquote>\n\nI guess my bad for being specific. <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol2.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"Laughing\">", "time": "Thu May 01, 2014 11:52 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=48518&start=300", "forum": "53", "thread": "48518"}

To be clear I agree on reading it again (I think I must have skimmed it the first time) that it is a scummy post (which is different from my read on Victor up till now), mostly because after some recent games I'm very wary of anyone who tries to create such stark dichotomies like the one that would cause him to say \"anyone not voting Burke NEEDS to explain.\" Still, I'm curious why you both neglected to mention anything to this effect after penguin's post.<br>\nimplosion's 268 is dramatic but I agree about 226 too, mainly because I don't like the phrase \"If you can't reconcile that with scum, I don't know what more I can say,\" I don't think reconciling is what we're trying to get at here. In other words, town doesn't look at posts and attempt to explain why they're scummy so much as see that posts are scummy and attempt to convince others how. Saying \"reconcile\" is saying forcing meaning into things that don't necessarily hold those meanings.<br>\n<br>\nSo in the spirit of avoiding dichotomy, instead of figuring out the scum on Burke's wagon, when there could be zero or one, I'll provide this list (again, this is at the time of my reading page 11 and I know we're another 5 pages in now but I think I should reflect the flip of my reads on implosion and Victor) of the most likely to least likely to be scum on Burke's wagon at the time of his death: &lt;insanity, Victor, implosion, penguin&gt;<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">page 12</div><br>\nmeh skimming walls<br>\nMelmond's post is good<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">page 14</div><br>\nSomething off about Froot Loop.

all on now-flipped town (four VCs because it's important to note that SKOT was a late comer on the Dunham wagon). There is nobody who was on all three wagons, HITD I think comes closest to not being on any of the wagons. I'm not sure what that means but I had a slight scum read on him already. I could say that him not being on any of these wagons indicates that he's been noncommittal, but that would be editorializing a little. In truth, he's been more tunnelly than anything, with his vote sitting on implosion while only nonchalantly encouraging anyone else to actually vote implosion.<br>\n<br>\nSpeaking of implosion, he perhaps looks worst of everyone on the wagons. He was on the earliest two wagons and didn't feel strongly for or against the third, but expressed intent to hammer.<br>\nThe other person I'm wary of based on the VCs is DukeC who disappeared after kicking off the insanity wagon but was at the head of two different wagons, one that got into lynch territory and one that did go through. Jake, Melmond and SKOT were on both wagons headed by DukeC, potential scumbuddy help from one or both of them.

This is the kind of bad argument that is both terrible as an argument and is likely being pushed by scum. First off it's completely reasonable to say that he'd have done this regardless of alignment; things like this have happened in the past (i know reckoner had an alt like that at one point). Second off even if you don't know that it's just reaching to say that scum would lie about being new to gain an advantage. SKOT /in'd on this account; he was planning to play on an alt and it's a stretch to say that he was planning to lie about being new only if he was scum. Melmond also accused him of rolefishing yesterday. Which is almost never the case with respect to someone asking for a claim. Asking for a claim is almost always done by either town who legitimately wants a claim or scum who would want a claim as town and thus is trying to look like they're town; so also a nullified point. <br>\n<br>\nJake's early reasoning (mostly <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5892688#p5892688\">474</a>) isn't particularly bad but I disagree with it.

Also assuming scum will all vote together in the event that any townie misvotes. <br>\n<br>\nThere's a difference between making assumptions and scumhunting. Your reasoning on SKOT is fine, because it's backed up in logic. But there is no inherent reason to suspect that scum had a pr read on wolfy. Or that scum shot him for his reads. Or that scum won't bus. Those are all just brute statements. They are quite possibly true, but there are other explanations. The assumption that scum won't bus isn't necessarily a bad thing (it just shows an underlying pattern of you assuming things that have no reason to be assumed). The other assumptions you're making, however, make no sense - scum could have shot wolfy because they thought he was some random pr. Or because they were afraid of his reads. Or because they thought he was the dayvig. Or because they didn't want a relatively fresh replacement to add more input. Or because they wanted to shoot someone who hadn't said much to prevent telling the town too much. <br>\n<br>\nI would in fact say there is reason to suspect that the reason is *not* because of his reads, because he had been pretty lurky for his time here, so even with accurate reads he probably wouldn't be a large threat (I also have reason to say that because I'm town and I think Victor is town). It's quite possible that it was because they thought he was a PR, but I see no reason to presume that it was.<br>\n<br>\nAs a general rule starting from things like NK analysis or bandwagon analysis is a bad idea. They're a great tool for supplementing direct scumhunting, but they should not be used as a starting point for getting reads. I don't think those assumptions are necessarily scummy either, but they're certainly a bad thing to have.", "time": "Fri May 30, 2014 11:49 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=48518&start=600", "forum": "53", "thread": "48518"}

If you have a correct scumread and a good enough case, then you can convince other people to vote with you. <br>\n<br>\n2) Alternatively, if you're wrong, then you can open up opportunity for others to criticize your case, which can disavow you of incorrect reads. So making cases can both help your own reads and help others' reads. <br>\n<br>\n3) It can elicit reactions from the accused. Different kinds of defensiveness or other reactions can be indicative of scum, or indicative of townies who were wrongly accused. Towns live on information; reactions to cases are just one more kind of information that can be useful for scumhunting. <br>\n<br>\n4) It can help others read the person making the case. If someone makes a case that looks completely fabricated, or that looks as if the case was being made for the sake of pushing on a given person rather than as a response to that person's behavior (i.e., that scum wanted to push on person X so they made up a case on person X, rather than town who looked at person X, decided they were scummy then made a case), they are more likely to be scum. If someone makes a case with new insights that appear genuine, then they can be more likely to be town.<br>\n<br>\n5) It can help with partner reads in the future.

If you have a correct scumread and a good enough case, then you can convince other people to vote with you. <br>\n<br>\n2) Alternatively, if you're wrong, then you can open up opportunity for others to criticize your case, which can disavow you of incorrect reads. So making cases can both help your own reads and help others' reads. <br>\n<br>\n3) It can elicit reactions from the accused. Different kinds of defensiveness or other reactions can be indicative of scum, or indicative of townies who were wrongly accused. Towns live on information; reactions to cases are just one more kind of information that can be useful for scumhunting. <br>\n<br>\n4) It can help others read the person making the case. If someone makes a case that looks completely fabricated, or that looks as if the case was being made for the sake of pushing on a given person rather than as a response to that person's behavior (i.e., that scum wanted to push on person X so they made up a case on person X, rather than town who looked at person X, decided they were scummy then made a case), they are more likely to be scum. If someone makes a case with new insights that appear genuine, then they can be more likely to be town.<br>\n<br>\n5) It can help with partner reads in the future. If person A makes a case on person B, and one of the two later flips scum, the case can be evaluated to decide if it was likely to be an instance of bussing.</div></blockquote>\nI'm sorry, but your entire 659 contains nothing of value.<br>\n<br>\nI'm not joking, man.

It's your call.</div></blockquote>\nI was kinda just going off my town read on Jake for a while so I just went along with FakeGod's assertions of himself but on a second read through, the above comments stood out to me. They may not seem like much but I noticed, after seeing these, that in general FakeGod has a tendency towards manipulation of individual people that I don't think is town-sided. Not only in his interactions with Melmond too, but with me in the conversation about compromise on implosion, he stated, after getting me to switch my vote to implosion, that he didn't have a read on me. It's really scummy then that he was forming associative reads between me and implosion before bothering to read me individually. The stark dichotomy he's set up between me and implosion, where only ONE OF US can be scum is bad enough in itself, (I almost always see scum compartmentalizing people and then treating those divisions as fact, it works its way into the town mindset slowly) not to mention he doesn't seem interested in voting correctly here. In other words, he has a scum read on both implosion and me (post reading my iso) but believes that only one of us can be town, yet is willing to lynch either of us indiscriminately.<br>\nThat apathy seems to me like it's a direct result of his successful diffusion of the SKOT wagon. It's pretty balls to the wall but this is 2014 site meta and white knighting is the new distancing.<br>\n<br>\ntl;dr: My theory is that FakeGod came in all hard but as soon as he saved his buddy SKOT, he didn't care who we lynch and so is compromising in places where he was previously very self-assured.<br>\n<br>\nAs for implosion, he could still be scum, I think a Fake, SKOT, imp team makes perfect sense, considering implosion's been the most vocal of SKOT-town after FakeGod.

We're people, it's gonna happen. But with FG, what's happening is he's using his (maybe-unique-to-you) perspective to draw conclusions that are incorrect and scummy. I've lost too many games playing \"if x is scum s/he would/n't do y\" to take that anymore. It's not a good argument to make.<br>\n<br>\nThe second thing: again, some level of consistency is to be expected from just about anyone. Consistency about this particular thing is I think completely unrelated to alignment. Self-meta is already something a lot of people would disagree with basing reads off of, self-meta about a style-related thing rather than an alignment-related thing is even more disagreeable for forming reads. How do you feel about self-meta anyway?:<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Sharpest-knife-on-tree wrote:</cite>EPM- seriously.  You have been in one game with me before.

Your statement of my \"hunting mislynches\"  as a characterization of my play is poor.  I have done what I do and look at things the way I do.

Like the first post in the dump where she's asking me about HITD. It feels like defending-without-really-defending. It feels somewhat more likely scum-&gt;scum than scum-&gt;town. The second post too, the fact that penguin takes time to try to clarify HITD's position. Another smaller interaction that I think is interesting is her interaction towards Froot in 211. It's an interesting way for scum to give a townread, and I want to say that it also looks somewhat scum-&gt;scum, but not strongly. I think SKOT is the one townread I'm not going to compromise on at this point. Beyond that I can't think of anything else that I can't be convinced of at this point.<br>\n<br>\nI think I want to not-lynch SKOT and Fakegod as a core for now. I like Fakegod's play so far today.

Spell that out, please.<br>\n<br>\nSharpest-Knife, why do you think scum are evasive and town aren't?  I realize the easy answer is that 'one is helpful, one is not' but taking it a step further and assuming scum want to look town, do you really think the pressure on Dunhamganger has been so ironclad that he's incapable of facing it head-on?  And since it's late and I'm too lazy to dig through your games...never mind, you have no completed games.  The idea that town would always be earnest and helpful and generally magically disproving their wagons is kind of a naive idea.  While in no way trying to sound condescending, getting wagoned for shit reasons as any alignment is a lot easier to armchair quarterback than play.<br>\n<br>\nAnd that you assume other people's language tics would match your personal scum tells is kind of funny, TBH.

Actually, i lied. After actually looking at his iso it looks like he thought I was a cop... which is interesting. It's certainly fakable as scum. Kind of soft-defending me for thinking I was a power role... but then if anti were scum, I would likely have been shot. (To be clear, I'm a vanilla townie, my read on victor changed for role-irrespective reasons, and anti should certainly correct me if i'm reading into what he said wrong). Scum could have somehow known there was a doctor still alive and have been trying to avoid it... or something. Which also doesn't quite make sense. I'm trying to think what could have stopped him from killing me as scum and it's possible 727 could have made him rethink me being a pr. I guess I'll just wait for him to say more before commenting more on this.<br>\n<br>\nAs for the p_a vote it gives me very strong feelings of neutrality. It doesn't particularly feel like a bus or not-a-bus. The rest of <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5926810#p5926810\">864</a> (after the penguin vote) is also an interesting post from the point of view of the possibility of epm-anti, because it would be a rather ominous bus... but I actually can very much see that being scum-&gt;scum. He busses penguin for one reason or another, and throws something epm's way so that he can either follow up or not later. That said the followup later doesn't feel like a bus. And I'm kind of stretching it. It just kind of pings my gut. epm-anti is probably pretty unlikely.</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: epm</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\">epm's vote on penguin feels bussy. Him saying \"I think that's L-1 though\" the post after just feels really strongly like a bus, although that's gut. It definitely doesn't mean anything but it really feels like it does. Regardless, the vote overall feels bussy, it's not just the post afterwards. It's the timing, to a degree. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5948839#p5948839\">1006</a> is also interesting. I think it can be read into but I'm not sure whether to read into it as something scum wouldn't be likely to do because it'd look awkward or something they would do for wifom value. I guess it's more likely the first. The whole tunneling skot forever thing pings me in a wrong way... I just don't want to think such a strong scumread on SKOT could come from town at this point in the game. Idt what to think of the actual tunnel itself though.</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: froot</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\">The only really interesting recent post is <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5941210#p5941210\">956</a>. Particularly the second paragraph. It feels like somewhat ballsy commentary for scum to make there. Her stance towards EPM is also another interesting partner consideration. \"I like EPM's answer to my question, *unvote*\" is an interesting kind of tactic if they're scum together. I need to think more about that one when I'm more awake.</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\nOverall epm and froot are more afraid to commit to things. With the exception being epm-&gt;skot. Froot said she didn't know where to go, epm said he needed to re-evaluate on day two. I also said something similar but the way both of them did that feels waffle-y.

Please show me where you think I am holding back. Sharing every detail of what I think is not something I am used to as very little of that goes on where I am from. Sure, that is not verifiable on your end.  My play if you examine it is consistent with my meta. Feel free to read any peacebringer finsihed game, even going back a decade. But no, you won't do that because you are more interested in getting a scum win I think.   I am who I am. I am intuitive. I am not detail oriented. I best express things the way I do and sometimes i cannot even really find the words to describe why I feel the way i do.  <br>\n<br>\nNow as to you, you have simply engaged in the stardard scum tunnel. you have sat on sidelines making comments about the state of things one way or another. You did the typical scum sit back and jump on end of a lynch at deadline. You have given crap for reads for someone who is read dependent. You gave a faux effort at VCA and only used it to appear to be doing something and to support your tunnel. So either you are really bad town and very anti-town in your play this whole game stuck in confirm bias on an outsider or you are scum. I think you are better then being locked into confbias and your play has equated scum play in other closed games.   <br>\n<br>\nNow, sure is there the possibility that you are just really that bad a player, maybe. I have tried to look at it from that angle to see if I am just blinded by your tunnell. Sometimes though things are exactly what they appear to be.  Historically folks who tunnel me at this point of game are scum looking to convince others to get an easy lynch and win the game. Melmond is locked in confbias based on his own prejuidice so all scum have to do is convince one more town of me being scum and game will be over.  <br>\nAs to Anti- the very avoidance of this thread and game right now is very suspiscious and seems very scummy. He is active elsewhere. <br>\n<br>\nI can only do what I know how to do.  As to reads. I have thought Implos leaned town. I thought froot was a typical reaction to me and had null and flipped back and forth on the lean.  HITD had no clue. Anti has done nothing.

Yes, I have tried to convince you of my role and you interpret it as \"trying to seem\" scummy. I can only play how I play and be who I am.  This unfortunately will result in town losing and losing today if I cannot do what I can to convince you and the rest of town of error. I am not very good at such persuasion.   <br>\n<br>\nYou call out my voting record and yes, on surface is lousy.  I wish I had knowledge that would have enable me to appear better, but alas I am simply town. Yes, I agree PR add in evasion to their arsenal. As such, I can tend to pick out \"RPs\" good or bad vs just scum. This has been consistent with me but you have no knowledge of same.   The dunham vote was simply cultural difference.  Victor I thoughts was scum as he played different that a concurrent game and I wrongly viewed town in that game. I had the differences in play right but read the wrong way.  Sadly, I thought his claim was a bit suspect and got hung up on the potential of role distribution.  As to you, I voted you and then backed off. The vote on you was sheeping Jake's view at the time as I know he gets good reads. However, when looking at it I changed my mind, correct?    Insanity vote, I got stuck on the Burke segment and that is a typical day one result.    You can continue to look at what I do and how I react as scummy. You have demonstrated that other people have given you reason to react to me the way you do.  I will be confirmed when flip and when town loses but at least I am making every effort to everythign I know to prevent the error.  Now you may ask if I know the way I play can cause town loss and put in bad position at the end game, why do I do and play the way I do.  I do not know how to be different then how I am.  Just a fact.   Now I wish I could make an arguement about you are EPM being gone if I was part of scum team, but I cannot make that argument given the way things went down.  <br>\n<br>\nEPM to me does seem like the scum EPM I have encountered before. Maybe that is confirmation bias on my end adn the scum are really implosion and froot loop.  I don't know.  <br>\nI need to take a bit more to sort that out.
