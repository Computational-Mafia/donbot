{"number": 1, "id": "2748086", "user": "InflatablePie", "user_id": "12696", "content": "<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:darkred\">Pie's Rules:</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\n0. Have fun! Try not to take things too personally - remember, it's just a game. In addition, please do not purposely try and ruin a player&#8217;s game experience. Being harsh for reactions is fine, to an extent &#8211; use common sense and judgment to determine if you are going &#8220;too far&#8221;. In other words, no flaming, please.<br>\n<br>\n1. Do <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">NOT</div> quote anything directly from the GameMod. Obviously, rules, flavor, vote counts, etc. are okay to quote - this mostly applies to Role PMs and whatnot. In addition, do <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">NOT</div> link anyone to any QuickTopics that you have been given, to <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">ANYONE</div>.<br>\n<br>\n2. Do <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">NOT</div> talk to anyone outside of this thread during the Day Phase. In addition, you may only talk to certain players at Night IF and ONLY IF it is part of your role (and is stated in your Role PM). If it is not stated that you may communicate with another player, you may not do so. Anyone found violating this rule shall be modkilled and autolossed. This rule still applies to dead players - keep all game-related comments in the \"dead thread\".<br>\n<br>\n3. To vote for a player, use the following format (in <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">BOLD</div>): <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: User</div>. To unvote, simply say <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Unvote</div>, again in bold. Unvotes are <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">required</div> - for my sanity, votes without a previous unvote will not be counted. If the vote is not bolded, due to no tags or tag error (or some other reason) it will not count. A player that receives a majority of votes (50% of the number of players + 1) will be lynched and the game will enter Twilight. Once a player has been lynched, any further votes and unvotes will not be counted.<br>\n<br>\n4. You may vote for a no lynch on any day. If an even number of players are alive, a no lynch requires that exactly half of the living players vote for it (6/12, for example). If an odd number of players are alive, a no lynch requires the same number of votes as a lynch would (4/7, for example).<br>\n<br>\n5. Day 1 will have a set deadline of roughly two weeks and four days. Each Day Phase after Day 1 will last for approximately two weeks. Deadline extensions may be given in certain circumstances, such as replacements coming in close to deadline. If a lynch has not been reached by the deadline, there will be No Lynch. Night phases will last for about 72 hours. <br>\n<br>\n6. Any player who does not post for 72 consecutive hours will be prodded. If they fail to post within 24 hours of me sending the prod, they will be replaced. Any player who is prodded five times in one game OR four times within a two-game-Day span OR three times in one game-Day will be replaced outright. Exceptions may be made on an individual basis for players who post in-thread announcing absences ahead of time (otherwise known as V/LA).<br>\n<br>\n7. Please <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">try</div> to make at least one post per real-life day. Multiple posts in one day are even better. If you won&#8217;t be posting for roughly 48 hours or more, please let both your fellow players and myself know in-thread (<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">@Mod/Players: V/LA for *amount of time*</div>). If you are taking a very large V/LA (a week is pushing it), I reserve the right to replace you. <br>\n<br>\n8. Once you are lynched or nightkilled, you are dead. You are allowed to make one \"bah\" post about how you hate being a zombie, or how tasty brains are, or whatever. This post may <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">not</div> contain any game-related content. Please refrain from posting in the thread for the remainder of the game - you will receive a link to a \"dead thread\" to discuss the game with other dead players. You may post normally during the Twilight of your impeding lynch, if you wish.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:darkred\">9. Dark red is my mod color. Please try not to use it in-thread.</div><br>\n<br>\n10. Do not use color tags, size tags, random capitalization and symbols, etc. to be intentionally disruptive. Do not use size tags to create barely readable secret messages (this includes Size 0, of course). In addition, refrain from using encryptions such as steganography or cryptography.<br>\n<br>\n11. Just because I'm &#8220;The Mod Your God&#8221; doesn&#8217;t mean that I&#8217;m perfect. If you feel that any kind of mistake was made (vote count, deadline information or anything else), send a PM to me or ask in-thread. I will respond via PM if asked by PM, and in-thread if asked in-thread. I will not address any questions related to the setup or things like that, nor will I answer anything pertaining to your role in-thread (ask these questions via PM, please).<br>\n<br>\n12. I will try to have a vote count up every few pages; at the <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">minimum</div>, once per real life day. If you feel that I have gone too long without putting up a vote count, feel free to ask for a vote count in-thread. To ask for a vote count, say something like <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">@Mod: Vote Count/Totals</div> and I will have a count up ASAP.<br>\n<br>\n13. If you feel that this game is no longer fun, or it is is no longer something that you wish to be involved with, or if a personal issue has come up that requires you stop playing my game, etc., you may PM me asking to be replaced. All requests for replacement will be taken seriously, so do not jokingly send me a replacement request. If you are replaced, you are not allowed back into the slot you have been dropped from, nor are you allowed to post in the game thread until endgame. <br>\n <br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#BF0000\"><br>\nElastic Clause: I may make changes to these rules as I see fit. If I ever make any major changes (outside of spelling/grammar, rewording for clarification, etc.), it will be announced in-thread as soon as possible. I assure you, no changes will be made specifically to punish any participant(s) or anything like that.</div><br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\nThis is a closed setup.

I'm especially not fond of it because scum have the ability to night talk before it, and now can predict things and act in ways that allow them to maneuver through reasonably easily.

He's the most likely to pull a \"no you weren't!\" slip, so if I was going to do it, it would be him.  Also, I want a goddamn read on Pergol.  He likes to lurk.

Have you noticed that I have not voted yet?? My words express my opinions. If you cannot read them or my messages are confusing, just ask, but I have expressed clearly that I was mostly looking at IS and Strike. I do not need to show off saying, I am looking you \"BECAUSE I AM TOWN\", \"I AM SCUMHUNTING\", HEY YOU SEE ME GUYS? I AM A GOOD TOWNIE...if you need to do this, then I will ask myself whether you are scum, because I do not see the reason for which a townie would do so. I have expressed very openly my observations, and I have shared them. That is pro-town, the rest is either a contest of \"im the towniest among the townies\" or \"im the dick-est among the dick-ies\".

This was the first day in 2 weeks. I am planning to use all the time we have for deciding which is the best lynch. And when I have enough observations, I will do my cases and attack more seriously players. Meanwhile, I post my observations for you to notice what I am finding relevant along the game.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>simo wrote:</cite> again you did nothing with it, you just left it\n</div></blockquote>\n\nAgain, what am i supposed to do? SHOUT MORE?? I do not need to vote someone everytime i find a scumread, or i would be voting 10-20 times every day. I post my thoughts and give ideas for people to observe/analyze.

Lurking gives you a host of benefits as scum.  There's no time for scumslips.  If you don't post anything, no one will find anything scummy that you posted.   You don't have to commit to a wagon until you're sure it's going well, if people don't like your behavior you can slide by, and if the town is full of arguing personalities, you get overlooked.

Not only that, but they stifle natural conversation.<br>\n<br>\nAll that Crazy is doing is walking down the mountain and telling us plebeians that a higher power has deemed who we should think is the scum.

Not a groundbreaking claim, but it's the truth.<br>\n<br>\nAnalysis time, and some responses. Starting at page 8.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>CrazyQuestions wrote:</cite>By popular petition, I start with Shadow. I continue later.<br>\nSHADOW<br>\n1. Parrots my words attacking IS in his first post. I read his vote on me as a joke, but mixes a serious criticisms with a fun joke. <br>\n2. He moves into clarifications with me and empty discussions with Empking, including ridiculous extreme arguments like depicting Empking as someone who already found scum in 10 posts. Shadow can perfectly be interested in slow play, but in that case and thinking as I do, where is he trying to get hints or reads? Which players is he targeting or studying?<br>\n3. When pressured to participate after lurking, he mixes a \"defence\" of lurking as null-tell with an attack to the player who favours wagoning lurkers (Grey) at the same time that Grey has disfavoured the player with whom Shadow is discussing (Empking). In his last post, he parrots me again as I pointed out in my summary how IS' case is just one observation (that is not even his).<br>\n\n</div></blockquote>1. I have no problem with this criticism. I don't like that you called it parroting, but it's understandable that you see it that way.<br>\n2. You call my argument \"Extreme\" and \"Ridiculous\", but Empking did actually say that he thought he had found scum in his post, roughly 10 pages in. I am interested in slow play, as it's easier to analyse. I'll summarise my reads later in this post.<br>\n3. Once again, not liking that you call it parroting, but I'll live. Same point as point 1.<br>\nI didn't try to defend lurkers, I just think that certain players are/were trying to push a lynch on lurkers, which is an easy lynch to push, and rarely finds scum this early in the game.<br>\n<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Erratus Apathos wrote:</cite>You know why you see me as not scumhunting? Because both Shado and IS are flat out not responding to the cases on them. Shado isn't explaining why he's not scum hunting, and IS isn't answering shit. I'm scum hunting; they're refusing to be hunted. <br>\nNow Shado is just resorting to ad hominem. </div></blockquote>Apologies to IS for telling him to fuck off, but I was feeling a little stressed at the time, and I forgot the main rule of Mafia (Have fun). It won't happen again. However, as you said, I wasn't responding to the cases against me, so I'm doing that now.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Empking wrote:</cite>Your being scum is condition on Shado being scum.</div></blockquote>This is a dangerous statement to make, because while alignment flips are useful for making connections between players after someone flips, some people could use this the other way, and clear certain people as town based on a flip of a town player.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>CrazyQuestions wrote:</cite>GREYICE<br>\n2. His attacks tend to focus on those players who \"favoured\" him (calls longing buddier, Shadow lurker), and takes the side of Empking. He does not expose any theory on what he was expecting to happen from his funny thing, which sounds bad. And quickly he moves into lurkers (saporo).<br>\n<br>\nIS is attacking without any coherence and does not let even answer (and Erratus is suspecting of IS)</div></blockquote>\nRE: GreyICE: I see that point as GreyICE possibly trying to get closer to his attackers so they don't attack him as much.<br>\nRE: Point 2: QFT.<br>\n<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>GreyICE wrote:</cite>Expected, Crazy?

I'll tip my hand at this point, that was my goal.  It's hard to do, because you want to do something that's insane, but not specifically scum (you get much less information out of wagons that are formed because the victim has just been mimicking total scum).  <br>\n<br>\nI have no idea why anyone would defend me rather than wait for me to defend myself, my actions can at best be described as 'eccentric.'

What this means to you guys is that you're probably/almost definitely not going to get a post of substance from me today as I have shit I need to do and can't devote 3 hours just to reading, let alone whatever time it takes to formulate a post on the players. <br>\n<br>\n------------------<br>\n<br>\nIn an attempt to make this post not worthless though (even though it probably will be since I've only read the first third of the game. I'm at the part where Shado just got 3 quick votes):<br>\n<br>\n I'd like to say that I'm not seeing a CQ town. Seems like a lot of random questions to appear helpful and over-analysis to the max. I'm not really sure on the meta behind her, but I take it she's a fairly big name player,  but I'm not understanding anyone calling her town. Not sure if this is a scum read necessarily, but definitely neutral / neutral-scummy. <br>\n<br>\nIS is another big name, I suppose? I'm having problems reading that one. Like a lot of problems. We'll just call this a neutral read for now. <br>\n<br>\nShadow is someone I've played with a lot, and I'm not getting scum-vibe from his direction. He's playing his standard town meta. Granted, I've never seen Shado scum, but he tends to get mislynched a lot because he plays REALLY scummy town. I'm not trying to excuse his play, but I'd like that fact to be known and taken into consideration. <br>\n<br>\nGrey seems town to me. <br>\n<br>\nel simo seems to be playing differently from last game where he seemed pretty obv town, but then again, I was scum that game so I was looking at him differently. His posts seemed more genuine and helpful though, he just seems a little unhelpful this game. <br>\n<br>\nEmp seems town too, but I'm more flexible on this read. <br>\n<br>\nTL seems... ugh...<br>\n<br>\nSubstrike is a neutral read at the moment.

I think he really plays the daddy-son game with IS (go back and read the son-daddy story if you missed this). Notice how in his first post, he observes my attack on IS and tends to correct IS. He uses a noticeable expression for a first post, like IGMOY IS (mafia). He attacks two other players like Empking (?) and Shadow (Town) with less emphasis, but decides to vote Shadow (Town). After realizing of his misunderstanding, unvotes and votes Empking (?). The player to whom he dedicated more time, IS (mafia), remains untouched. <br>\n<br>\n2. His incoherences on the reasons we both had to attack IS (mafia) remain. He has not explained how he can at the same time say that he does not understand my reasons but declare they are very different to his. <br>\n<br>\n3. As I described in my first summary, he turns his views outside the wagonners Empking (?)/ IS (mafia). Suddenly, he analyzes questioners of the wagon or the wagonee himself, sorrow (town), Greyice (town). There is couple of posts in which he expresses at the same time that he is fine with IS (mafia) (ISO 4 and 5, he just \"needed\" some clarification) while he says to me that he was skeptical about IS' (mafia) play. He votes here and there, lurkers and then Empking (?) again, accusing him of calling lurkers scum. Goes back to a lurker, sorrow (?) stating very precisely that of course, he is not voting for lurkiness. However, his reasons are very weak since Sorrow (?) was lurking most of the time. He remains without expressing a clear position on the full wagon.<br>\n<br>\n4. Despite he is not expressing openly his view, he adds fire to the wagon on shadow (town) in ISO 15, by defending EMP (?) (quite remarkable since his only serious active target was Empking (?) along day 1 and empking (?) is aiming to lynch shadow (town)). In post 17, he fences even more announcing two coupled teams but expressing no serious opinions. Once he is accused of fence-sitting, he announces that Shadow (town) is being scummy, but twice he justifies that \"Your play, if you are town, has been far below optimal, at best.\" and later he added \"Shado's been playing like a scum, even if he's town.\" And decides to vote for shadow (town) after buddying Grey (town) and setting up some sort of day 2 attack to Empking (?) if shadow (town) is not scum.<br>\n<br>\nSummary: I find Strike scummy.

My question was why Erratus used IS' attack on Shadow to increase his own attack on Shadow. My observation was and is that IS just parroted Erratus, and after that, started to attack heavily. Erratus argues that post 97 of IS was not of the aggressive sort. But this was already my observation. Post 97 is the one where IS parroted Erratus. Erratus argues that other people was attacking shadow coherently. I agree. I joined the wagon because of several coherent observations by several people. But this does not answer my question. The question remains, why he used IS' nonsensical way of attacking to attack more Shadow (the ad hominem episode). Especially, it does not fit with the play I observe by Erratus.<br>\n<br>\nHaving said so, this is my only negative observation on Erratus. Besides, I hardly reconcile IS-Erratus as mafia. For instance, I would expect less interaction in attacking shadow and maybe, some interaction in attacking a third player. <br>\n<br>\nOverall, I do not consider Erratus highly scummy.<br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\nMore analysis tomorrow.

Interaction is a term that includes the two parts (IS and ME). I have not read any single comment in your initial accusation/vote that talks of MY actions. For instance, you did not mention how I pointed out to IS and Strike, or you have not mentioned how I answered back to IS' posts on me, etc etc, describing in which way I seemed scummy or townish. You just observed IS' behavior and read it as some kind of distancing, without reading my reactions at all.

Yet her lack of definition day 1 is worrying. However, I disagree with the existence of a SERIOUS incoherence. Notice how she mentioned first the emotional outbursts of IS, and included the word SUPER. That is consistent with her seeing this as a main point. Later added that Erratus had \"a point\" which sounds something minor after the big message above. I would interpret this as confusing, and Im more interested about her lack of definition day 1.

Day 2 and 3, he is changing his own views on players, since I was scummy and now I am obvtown, Empking seemed town and then he voted for him, Erratus was not even analyzed in his first summary. It is possible that his views on empking and Erratus are based on flips, but he is not describing at all such connections. He promised a case on Erratus on monday, but has posted few times since then without such case. On the contrary, he is attacking erratus for the new posts but not for old ones. It might be consistent with a very unhelpful player not reading the game, but it is at least worth checking.

After a long day thinking like that with 18 posts written about it, am I wrong in thinking that ElSimio was reading that action as evidence of my scumminess AGAINST a townie????<br>\nDay 3 starts, IS is known to be scum, and he reads me as his mate and after Empking abandons the wagon he says <br>\n<br>\n\"This is a good point that I didn't take into account...\"<br>\n<br>\nReally? He didnt take into account that GOOD POINT after 18 posts dedicated to THAT SORT OF POINT AND ONLY TO THAT SORT OF POINT !!

{"number": 516, "id": "2794381", "user": "CrazyQuestions", "user_id": "14867", "content": "Since some people wanted this, here you have an extra episode of the MLB. Nine strikes. All players out. Your time to defend, Strike. You can obviously say again that you are tired of arguing with me. You can point out to your previous defences if you think you answered appropiately already.<br>\n<br>\nAlso, I am happy with describing the validity of these points with other players. At the end, 3 strikes are enough to eliminate a player.<br>\n<br>\nStrike 1. <br>\n<br>\nDescription: IS receives attention after his initial contribution. Strike dedicates the first and <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">largest</div> part of his initial post to criticize IS. This attack uses tough expressions like <div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">awfully opportunistic</div> and <div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">IGMOY stranger</div>. However, in the same post he discusses two other players (Shadow and Empking) with two very odd reasons. The former is attacked and voted after a misinterpretation. The second is accused (and voted after the correction of his mistake on shadow) of an opportunistic vote and indirectly, of creating a wagon exploding in numbers. This is clearly a bit ridiculous as Empking just voted first and the wagon created later with the action of two other players.<br>\n<br>\nInterpretation: IS is scum and IMO, strike-mate may be executing a distancing exercise. Expressed the criticism after I pointed out to the excesses of IS, but after the attack, Strike found reasons to attack and especially vote, other people.<br>\n<br>\nStrike 2.<br>\n<br>\nDescription: Strike indirectly criticizes Empking for a wagon exploding in numbers. However, he does not criticize IS  for the wagon numbers, even when IS placed a posterior vote and with a tone that is leading and firing the wagon much more. Also, strike does not even ask me about the reasons of my vote, which is the third in the wagon. If he is interested about the numbers of the wagon, why wouldnt he ask me about my vote?<br>\n<br>\nInterpretation: Same than in 1. <br>\n<br>\nStrike 3.<br>\n<br>\nDescription: Strike declares not to understand my criticism to IS. In the same post, however, he tells to shadow that IS has clear flaws that <div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">I was actually pointing out</div>. His explanations about this point are, IMO, defficient.<br>\n<br>\nInterpretation: Strike reacts to the attack on IS by attacking a bit IS' actions, but controlling/checking the accusations of other people. However, when he moved to attack other players (Shadow and Empking) he uses me to attack Shadow. I think he partially/fully understood my initial attack and was just trying to check/explore/buddy the attack. <br>\n<br>\nStrike 4.<br>\n<br>\nDescription: Strike is under some pressure by both Empking and me. Empking pushes him because of the (weak) reasons expressed by Strike to vote Empking. I am pushing him because of the Strikes 1 and 3 described above. His reaction is to change his vote without expressing any change of mind regarding Empking. The target is Sorrow, and the reason is very surprising. It is basically for expressing/voting Empking aligned with him, in a lurker style.<br>\nIn his next post after the vote, he feels comfortable about his vote because he declares that sorrow is avoiding the game. That obviously is merely a natural consequence of the lurker play of sorrow, that was/is pretty evident.<br>\n<br>\nInterpretation: Strike is nervous and decides to move towards a safe participant, a lurker. <br>\n<br>\nStrike 5.<br>\n<br>\nDescription: Strike comes back to attack Empking. He uses as a reason that Empking is calling someone lurker early in the game and using that to attack. Surprisingly, Strike attacked sorrow for avoiding the game and at the same time agreed Empking that Grey's retreat was not a good sign. Now he finds Empking's observation scummy even if Empking was totally right in saying that Grey was voluntarily skipping the game and Strike pointed out to a clear lurker as sorrow. The incoherence is very serious. He says <div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">While I agree that lurking is, eventually, a scum tell, I believe that early in the game it is a null tell</div>. But before he had said to be comfortable about his vote because Sorrow was avoiding the game. <br>\n<br>\nInterpretation:  This is a very personal interpretation. I find ElSimio scummy. ElSimio and Empking were fighting here and Strike came back to Empking in a very obvious way.<br>\n<br>\nStrike 6.<br>\n<br>\nDescription: Sorrow appears from the shadows and points out to Strike because of the lurking inconsistency. The response in posts 252 and 253 is an OMGUSING one.<br>\n<br>\nInterpretation: He was caught in the inconsistency and reacted by voting back to Sorrow very defensively. <br>\n<br>\nStrike 7.<br>\n<br>\nDescription: Strike gives opinion on Shadow in the last minute. Jumps in posts 326, 327 and 328, and launches the possible teams. He writes some stuff on shadow in the lynch vote since he never did. Notice also how in the subsequent posts, he even agrees with Grey on a post about the connection between Empking and me. That is very important since he considered Shadow and Grey were the most likely team and Empking was a secondary team.<br>\n<br>\nInterpretation: IMO, setting up lynches for day 2 knowing the future flip of Shadow. <br>\n<br>\nStrike 8.<br>\n<br>\nDescription: When voting for Shadow, he uses expressions like <div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Shado's been playing like a scum, even if he's town</div> and <div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Your play, if you are town, has been far below optimal, at best</div>.<br>\n<br>\nInterpretation: They suggest he knows Shadow is town and it sounds like overjustifying his vote for a townie.<br>\n<br>\nStrike 9. <br>\n<br>\nDescription: Voted for IS after the investigation and was the only player putting the attention in the investigation. Twice. I assume this is what sorrow describes as obvious bus.<br>\n<br>\nInterpretation: I love surfing.", "time": "Mon Feb 14, 2011 12:49 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=16214&start=500", "forum": "53", "thread": "16214"}

{"number": 532, "id": "2797791", "user": "CrazyQuestions", "user_id": "14867", "content": "Since Strike does not want to make his case on me, I will copy all his comments towards me and try to build his own case.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">1. Chainsawing for Empking.</div><br>\n<br>\nISO 4. <blockquote><div><cite>strike wrote:</cite> Also, Crazy <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">you could just as easily be</div> chainsawing for EMP right now. </div></blockquote>\nISO 5. <blockquote><div><cite>strike wrote:</cite>Crazy, your chainsaw <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">occured</div> when I vote for EMP and then you suddenly post a wall of text on p1 explaining why I'm mafia. </div></blockquote>\n\nFirst: I post walls of text most of the time. I analyze the game. I provide information on the rest of players. Regarding my observation, I did not explain why you were mafia, but merely described one scummy observation of you. You can read back my post after your vote and see how the final two lines state clearly that I would not use the word SUSPECT for these episodes because I like slow play. <br>\n<br>\nSecond: The wall of text links you with IS, as described in my summary of you. I had started my observation on IS before your vote. Obviously, I only could make my additional comments on you AFTER your posts/votes. The fact that I wrote after your vote does not explain at all why I was chainsawing for any player. The fact that I was observing IS and the person who posted around him (you) is a signal that my post has nothing to do with chainsawing but with scumhunting.<br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\nOnce explained, I want to add something. Substrike did not mention any type of chainsawing after my first wall of text in his ISO 3. It was only after he perceived the additional pressure on him that he \"defended\" this way, in an increasing way, as the boldface of ISOs 4 and 5 demonstrate. It is clear not an offensive scumhunting observation. In the most favorable interpretation towards hims, it is a biased-townie defensive stuff. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">2. Simplification of his answers.</div><br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>strike wrote:</cite>\nC) none of the above. Try again next week though, for better random results of attempting to simplify my answers into options a or b without actually reading my justifications.\n</div></blockquote>\n\nFirst: Again as in his first accusations, he just throws an accusation without any evidence. Labelling a player as \"simplifying your answers\" without the evidence, waiting for people to buy this argument. It is especially relevant since I post a lot, and some less interested people might be tempted to read me as \"oh...another wall...surely she is manipulating and stuff...\"<br>\n<br>\nSecond: Regarding the simplification itself, my answer points out to my own summary on Strike. I think he was inconsistent in the lurking stuff regarding MS. If more clarifications are needed, I am happy to describe in more detail.<br>\n<br>\n3. Grasping for straws.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>strike wrote:</cite> And Crazy you're really grasping for straws on that 3 scum thing, I want everyone else to note that. </div></blockquote>\n\nFirst: I pointed out how you were pretty convinced of the structure. I did not call it a serious scum slip, and my case on you is not built upon this, but every piece of information is relevant.<br>\n<br>\nSecond: I especially found interesting that you avoided to include MS in your teams and, as much, you refered to him as LURKER in these teams. I described it, and it is not any kind of grasping because we had pointed out repeatedly on your \"inconsistencies\" regarding voting lurkers or not.<br>\n<br>\n4. Buddying with Empking plus extra stuff.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>strike wrote:</cite> Crazy, your buddying with EMP is obvious. Your hypocritical arguments in dealing with him versus dealing with me, and in twisting the words of almost everything I've done, is noted. You're mis-repping me, you've been mis-repping me, and I'm done trying to argue with you about it. You and EMP are our remaining scum. </div></blockquote>\n\nFirst: Again, labelling a player without describing the evidence.<br>\n<br>\nSecond: Contradictory. Buddying your scum-mate?<br>\n<br>\nThird: Strike has not discussed my arguments on him, as he said very quickly \"im done with your stuff\", so hardly we cant discuss about the validity of my arguments or the misrepresentation.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>strike wrote:</cite>\nHe tried to bus you and you've responded by \"taking the high road.\" You point out his lack of a case towards you, then you attack me based on my \"lack of cases\" on people, which I think is bullshit, by the way. </div></blockquote>\n\nFirst: More labellings, no evidence<br>\n<br>\nSecond: I pointed out his lack of a case and I mentioned in my analysis of him that this modified a bit my view of him. However, an observation is not enough to find someone scummy. Obviously, I have not based my attack on you \"on your lack of cases\". That is a clear misrepresentation, evidence can be seen in my summaries of you and the extended case I have described after.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>strike wrote:</cite> You're acting like you know more than the rest of us, you've been acting that way since day 1. Your third point about me going after townies gets into nothing but WIFOM. I went after town because I didn't know if they were town. Your calling that into question makes me believe that you have information that we don't.\n</div></blockquote>\n\nEvidence, please. I have not built my case on you based on the flips of your attacked players. These are minor observations that add up to my general case. I think there is a minor positive correlation between helping scum-lynching town and being scum. Not high, but i think it exists. How is that connected to having \"more information\" than you?<br>\n<br>\n5. Wishing to lynch everybody.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>strike wrote:</cite> CQ is there anyone other than your bff EmpKing that you don't find scummy, honestly? Or are you just content with lynching everyone but your hard won ally? </div></blockquote>\n\nFirst: lack of evidence in the accusation again.<br>\n<br>\nSecond: Describing possible scummy behaviors by players and finding all of them scummy are two very different things. I have obviously stated degrees of scumminess in my summaries that can be read by everyone. I have dedicated time in very different amounts, with a clear interest for the players I found scummier and described as scummier. IS accused me of stopping a lynch and my behavior is clearly promoting the transmition of information and not rushing/wishing blood and lynches. I think all these arguments are correct, but it is difficult to say more since you do not present any evidence in any of your accusations.<br>\n<br>\n6. Random play and trying to appear town.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>strike wrote:</cite> CQ's playstyle has been random and an attempt at appearing town. </div></blockquote>\n\n<br>\nFirst: lack of evidence, again??<br>\n<br>\nSecond: difficult again to say how my play is not random. If i had to argue about it, I would say I am quite analytical and participative as a constant, and my observations on players are usually of scum type more than town type, I dont make \"you are town because of this\" observations many times, so that is a constant too. I tend to make summaries of my observations to share information, and I have done it consistently at adequate moments of time, so I dont see any randomness there either. I have no interest in appearing town more than the small benefit for the town that this would have. I think my style is tiring for some people and I prefer to keep it because I want to share as much information as possible. I think \"appearing town\" would advice to reduce the length and amount of my posts because there are many impulsive non-analytical players around, but that would imply reducing the share of information and accelerating decisions, and I think both things are bad for town.", "time": "Wed Feb 16, 2011 12:40 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=16214&start=525", "forum": "53", "thread": "16214"}

I believe I outlined those reasons sufficiently, given my lack of information on D1, I went for the suspect that made the most suspense at the time.

MS is guaranteed 100% scum in my mind, if you lynch no one else, please lynch him.  This is how he played in a game in which he was scum, Newbie 984.

How scummy is this? Im not attacking you, but I added this observation and when reading back the IS episode, I note that just after he answered you, you voted together for shadow, who flipped town.

{"number": 569, "id": "2802831", "user": "CrazyQuestions", "user_id": "14867", "content": "Substrike's case on MS<br>\n<br>\n1. Votes Empking without reasons.<br>\n<br>\n[quote=\"strike\" Not sure how I feel about MS's vote on EMP. Not a whole lot of reasoning there other than \"oh look, wagon that's not being questioned intensely, yet.\" In fact I think that's the first honest scum post I've seen all game:<br>\n<br>\nUNVOTE: EMPKing<br>\n<br>\nVOTE: Midnight's Sorrow<br>\n[/quote]<br>\n<br>\nMS first post was number 31. His vote can be thus considered his first participation in the game. Clearly, the game was out of the RVS but the amount of information is yet very limited. That a player writes his first post and votes in such a way cannot be considered, by any means FIRST HONEST SCUM POST. <br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\nNow, extra attack on strike<br>\n<br>\nFirst: Strike had added pressure to Empking with expressions like \"Awfully opportunistic\", \"wagon shot up in numbers so quickly\", <br>\n\"that's <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">scummy</div>\", \"as suspect as\", \"try to bully\". Hence, how can be the FIRST HONEST SCUM POST he reads? how can be the  amount of scumminess so high as to forget his attack on Empking?<br>\n<br>\nSecond: It is very inconsistent that after all these expressions on Empking, a player joins the wagon and he reacts this way. Strike was seriously attacking Empking. In my view, Empking's responses were pushing him apart as scum, and he found any reason to leave the attack and move in lurk-safer waters.<br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\n2. Misrepresenting Strike<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>strike wrote:</cite> and you're taking both of my statements out of context. I don't like when people vote/pressure people who haven't even posted yet. You had already posted a scummilicious post. </div></blockquote>\n\nThe answer: These are the words by MS in his second post, after Strike changed his vote and voted for MS as described above.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>MS wrote:</cite> How wonderful of you to <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">have voted me last time for lurking</div>, and <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">then go ahead and say much later after you had switched votes to go about saying how much of a null tell lurking was</div>- as if that what I was doing in the first place &gt;.&gt;- What a wonderful contradiction you have made!\n</div></blockquote>\n\na) The reason exposed by Strike in his initial post can be described as \"a lurker came and voted without reasoning much\", being fair. <br>\nb) After this, strike mentioned couple of times that MS was \"a lurker\". Said nothing else. <br>\nc) He then criticized other people for \"voting for lurkers\"<br>\n<br>\nYou are a lurker, come back, read this, what do you say? It sounds pretty obvious. You say what MS said. This is a good observation by MS, as I mentioned. I do not see any serious misrepresentation in MS' words. We can discuss for hours about the subtle meanings of Strike's vote, but strike voted MS for being a lurker and joining a wagon without reasons. Nothing that MS is misrepresenting in his words...<br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\nNow, extra attack:<br>\n<br>\nFirst: MS post was number 200. His second post in the game. An obvious lurker. His two posts were lurker posts. A vote on Empking without much reasons, a comment on the inconsistency by Strike (to whom he was not afraid to point even if strike had been one of the few pushing MS). And Strike insisted in voting a lurker for doing lurker things. To see a OBVSCUM misrepresentation in MS words is exaggerated, and thus, the principal characteristic you can associate to MS at post 200 is....lurker??? This keeps his contradiction.<br>\n<br>\nSecond: MS third and fourth posts were numbers 246 and 248. A question for our contestants....do you know which TWO players were commented/attacked by MS in these posts (Strike accusation of misrepresentation comes after these, number 252)................IS and ElSimio. A cookie for those who guessed correctly. A casuality? well, I do not think so. But obviously, you can skip this point if you think is a casuality. The rest of my answer remains the same.<br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\n3. MS came out of active lurking to vote for him on the basis of a vote for a cop confirmed guilty.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>strike wrote:</cite> You come out of your active lurking to vote for me, on the grounds that I voted for a cop-confirmed guilty? Please, by all means, try again </div></blockquote>\n\nI do not think this is even a proper accusation, but i want to compile all words of Strike on MS to show he has no case at all (apart from lurking). The answer. This were the words by MS:<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>MS wrote:</cite> If I've ever seen a scum bus their buddy in a cop out like yesterday as... deftly as this guy, my mind be pulling up the blanks. </div></blockquote>\n\nAs you can see, he is accusing Strike for bussing a scum mate. Well, clearly, MS is not arguing a lot his accusation, but, is MS accusation credible? I think so very much, as I pointed in my own case. Again, this is a second observation done by MS on his own, despite his very serious lurking, these are his observations. In post 517, he clarifies the bus read comes from the declarations done after the vote. Strike said:<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>strike wrote:</cite>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Although</div> I do find the flavor there kind of suspect. I mean, why would results come back as \"town\" or \"anti-town\" when there clearly isn't a serial killer here?\n</div></blockquote>\n\nHe was the only player doubting partially of the report and role discussing, after his vote....I think MS observation is at least, worth-studying. Hence, it cannot be any point against MS. At most, it is a failed scumhunting attempt. And consistent with his play in the game.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n4. lurking and lack of content<br>\n<br>\nThere are several versions of this, but they have not been evolved more than this:<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>strike wrote:</cite> MS's active lurking is the scummiest thing in the game so far. Iso his posts and tell me how he's town, please. 8 posts. None of which have content. Scum. </div></blockquote>\n\nFirst: MS is a lurker. Yes. This is slightly scummy. It is the only observation by strike which is correct.<br>\n<br>\nSecond: Given that there are 8 posts, the 2 observations on Strike sound content. Not much, but given he wrote 8 posts and a total of around 20-30 lines, I think is standard. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n**********<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nHence, the summary of strike's case is:<br>\n<br>\nMS is a lurker.", "time": "Fri Feb 18, 2011 12:26 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=16214&start=550", "forum": "53", "thread": "16214"}

Not that it justifies going after townies of course, but I don't think Sub's attacks mentioned in the strikes were unjust to begin with, which is why I think his point applies here.<br>\n<br>\nStrike 3 (saying he didn't understand your criticism of IS):\n<blockquote><div><cite>substrike22 (169) wrote:</cite>I noticed you were pointing out inconsistencies, my problem with your case was that you called something \"curious\" which doesn't really jive with \"that's scum\" or \"that's town\".

If you were town you would've voted with that first post unless you had a question.

Instead, since I didn't vote, you posted a wall of worthless vote analysis explaining why my wagons were all over the place.  You had two options, pressure me with a panic vote by voting for me and trying to get me to vote for MS, or hope that Klazam came in and hammered me.
