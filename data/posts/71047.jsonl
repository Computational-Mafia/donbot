Play to your wincon but above all play to have fun.  Do not ruin the game for others.</li><li> If you have something that you need to communicate with me <span class=\"noboldsig\">bold</span> your text or I cannot guarantee I will see it.</li><li> As the MOD I reserve the right to modkill or force-replace players as I see fit.  </li><li> If you feel I have erred send me a PM and let me know.  </li><li> That said, do not bring disagreements with me into the thread.  That is what the PM is for.  The same goes for disagreements with other players.</li><li> Do not use invisible or in some way encrypted fonts or typing.</li><li> Do not quote communications with the moderator (in particular, your role PM).  Quoting the timestamp of your role PM counts as quoting your role PM.  Paraphrasing communications, however, is usually ok.</li></ul><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">General game rules: </span></span><br><ul><li> I will use the colour <span style=\"color: #FFAA00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">#FFAA00</span></span>. This is my color and only my color.  Don't use it.</li><li> A lynch is reached when a majority of all players (half rounded down plus one) are voting for the same target.</li><li> If a majority is not reached by the deadline, a No Lynch will occur.</li><li> You may vote No Lynch in the same way that you vote for a lynch.  Once a majority has voted for a no lynch the day immediately ends.  </li><li> Abuse of an infinite no-lynch/no-kill loop will not be tolerated.  Do not even contemplate it.</li><li> Votes must be written in <span class=\"noboldsig\">bold</span> as <span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: Player</span> or use the <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Player</span> tag.  Votes that are not bolded or tagged will not be counted. </li><li> Votes in quotes, spoiler tags or otherwise hidden will also not be counted.</li><li> Votes that misspell or have other minor errors will be counted as normal as long as I understand what you are getting at.</li><li> Unvotes are helpful, but not necessary.  Let me know if I make an error in vote counts and I will correct them.</li><li> I will try and do vote counts often but if you want one just let me know.  In general, I will be mainly available evenings (5 PM - 12 PM Pacific) and weekends, so you may not get a quick VC if it's in the middle of the day.</li><li> As the MOD I will keep communication down to the absolute minimum possible (aside from vote counts and the like).  I do not want to influence the game itself \u2013 that is for the players to do.</li><li>This is a closed setup.  The setup has been reviewed for normalcy and balance.  Normal game rules can be found <a href=\"https://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Normal_Game\" class=\"postlink\">here</a>.</li><li>Flips will have full role revealed (I will essentially post the PM you received on your flip with the obvious required reductions) </li></ul><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Game Flow: </span></span><br><ul><li> The Game will begin and the thread will be unlocked after 10 players confirm via PM, or 48 hours after role PMs are sent, whichever is faster.</li><li> Please announce if you are going on V/LA.  I prefer this announced in thread unless there is a specific reason not to.</li><li>  If you have not posted for 48 hours you will receive a prod.  If you do not post within 24 hours of a prod you will be replaced.</li><li> Three prods may result in being replaced.</li><li> The first two day phases will last a maximum of 14 days.  Day Three will last a maximum of 12 days, Day Four a maximum of 10 days, and all subsequent Days Phases no more than 8 days.</li><li> Each Night Phase will last 48 hours.  Starting on Night Three, I will accept speed deadlines if ALL players (including those without night actions) ask for it via PM.</li><li> You may communicate as normal during the twilight phase until I close the thread but votes/un-votes will not count.</li><li> Extensions may be granted for replacements or extenuating circumstances.  </li><li> A missed Night Action will result in a No Action.</li><li> The game will end when all threats to town have been eliminated or that is not possible.</li><li>A single player may not perform more than one action per night phase. This means that, for instance, a scum player may not use an active ability and kill a target player on the same night.</li><li> If you must replace out, PM me privately and stop posting in thread.</li></ul><br><div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: At least one player will receive the following role PM</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display: none;\"><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Welcome to Mini Normal 1893!

I announced it because I was being honest in my answer because I'm naive and expect honesty to work when i'm town, and the honest truth is I doubt myself when others question me on reads that shallow, and I also don't think it's really a bad thing there although it is in other times.<br><br>I also started scumleaning you (where I was nullreading you before) like a few posts before this one which is what spurred the comment about having reads almost exactly opposite to transcend's.

I'll clue you in, I'm not great at understanding other people and what they would do in specific situations, so I'm asking this so that if you go back on it later in an opportunistic way, or if you don't in a way that puts you in a bad position 'politically', I can really have something to chew on.</div></blockquote><br><br>I get that, but it's also a hard question for me to answer with absolutely no context.

Which still implies feeling as though you're scum. It's very much trying to play the LAMIST card, by pretending as though you can't possibly fathom me scumreading you, and the fact that you went after a bunch of other people instead of me, the person who you should go after as town because I can read you with scary accuracy, came across as an admission of guilt."}

There are a couple of things that I want to go over, before I do eventually vote. <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #4000FF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">1. JaeReed.</span></span></span> There is something that is bothering me about them this game. It's nothing that I can say that is scummy, but based on my past experience with them, they feel.. Different. For once, I want to say that they feel way more aggressive to what I'm used to. I know that they are trying to defend Impoetic, which I can see the reasoning for, but it feels a bit over the top to me. Is it not possible that Impoetic knows that you can read her, and she is specifically doing something to break your read on her? How come there hasn't been any visable thought of you thinking about this as a possibility? <br><br>As I stated earlier, you are being way more aggressive than I am used to. Is there a reason for this? Because the times as town, you really haven't been too aggressive unless you were defending a townread, but you're aggressive this whole game, regardless if it's defending or not. Can you shine a light onto why you're doing this? I believe the only time I've seen you as scum would be in a hydra with Impoetic, and I did correctly call you out as scum, after I was the day 1 lynch (surprise)<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #4000FF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">2. Nancy.</span></span></span> One thing that pinged me very quickly was when you seemed to suddenly defend me out of nowhere, why am I obvious town to you? If I remember correctly, we have played a game or two together, and if I remember correctly you've read me wrong each of those games? How come the thought process of that fact that you've read me wrong before, mean that you could be wrong about me now? Shouldn't it be weird that you find me as a townread when before when I was town you were always scumreading me?<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #4000FF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">3. Alisae.</span></span> </span>How do you feel about the fact that Jae scumreads you so much? If I remember correctly, they've read you wrong before when I was mafia and you were both town. How come the thought process hasn't crossed their mind that they could be wrong again? Isn't that something you would expect? Why have you not brought that up? (If you have, sorry I must have missed it)<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #4000FF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">4. Darklyn.</span></span></span> From what I've seen, it seems you have been given some townreads by certain people randomly, yet you haven't really questioned anyone for why they townread you. Why is this? Are you not afraid that mafia could be trying to pocket a potential mislynch town the road? Your iso and content does not warrant the TRs that you have gotten, and even you should know that yourself."}

JaeReed.</span></span></span> There is something that is bothering me about them this game. It's nothing that I can say that is scummy, but based on my past experience with them, they feel.. Different. For once, I want to say that they feel way more aggressive to what I'm used to. I know that they are trying to defend Impoetic, which I can see the reasoning for, but it feels a bit over the top to me. Is it not possible that Impoetic knows that you can read her, and she is specifically doing something to break your read on her? How come there hasn't been any visable thought of you thinking about this as a possibility? <br><br>As I stated earlier, you are being way more aggressive than I am used to. Is there a reason for this? Because the times as town, you really haven't been too aggressive unless you were defending a townread, but you're aggressive this whole game, regardless if it's defending or not. Can you shine a light onto why you're doing this? I believe the only time I've seen you as scum would be in a hydra with Impoetic, and I did correctly call you out as scum, after I was the day 1 lynch (surprise)</div></blockquote><br><br>I'm pretty sure I've played aggressively before in a game you've been in, the way I was going himiko and Trans in Pantheon mafia? Anyway, you mentioned even in this quote that I hydra'd with Impo as scum. I know her thought process as scum and her reactions, this just isn't it. I know her outside of games too, and I pay attention to her <strike>because i'm a creepy stalker</strike>. It's like the level you can soulread Claire (which I've seen you do before in Penguin mafia). There's just no way Impo is scum, she can't fool me especially when she wasn't even aware if she needed to. Like I never mentioned to her about the diff in her scum and towngames since I didn't play with her after Trial anyways since she quit forum maf.<br><br>If you want meta where I'm aggressive, Double Day Hydra Blitz is a good one, I was Chihiro in the Chihiro and Alter Ego hydra. <!-- l --><a class=\"postlink-local\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=83&amp;t=70181\">viewtopic.php?f=83&amp;t=70181</a><!-- l --><br><br>But there's been a lot of times where I've seen people as conftown from early game (and been right) like Ranger's micro with Charloux and Nahdia, the read on MURDERCAT in Nahdia's mini normal, C9++ on Charloux, Trees newbie on KTS. There's a reason my sig has that Charl quote.<br><br>Anyways<br>1st question: No I do not believe she could be doing anything to fool me, I know her too well.<br>2nd question: Because it's not a possibility.<br>3rd question: Sometimes I feel more aggressive in a game. Sometimes I feel awfully lazy. Depends on how I feel like approaching any given game.<br>4th question: See above.<br><br>Also the statement about calling me correctly as scum, you never did it in the main thread so it didn't matter ;p but also, it was like 5 minutes to deadline with the person who said he'd hammer you not being around and it was D1. Arguably I did the most protown thing there by hammering and I desperately wished I hadn't been awake and posting for it because of that. I would have hammered you as town because a D1 no lynch is awful for town. So thinking I was maf for the hammer is bad reasoning anyway."}

Different. For once, I want to say that they feel way more aggressive to what I'm used to. I know that they are trying to defend Impoetic, which I can see the reasoning for, but it feels a bit over the top to me. Is it not possible that Impoetic knows that you can read her, and she is specifically doing something to break your read on her? How come there hasn't been any visable thought of you thinking about this as a possibility? <br><br>As I stated earlier, you are being way more aggressive than I am used to. Is there a reason for this? Because the times as town, you really haven't been too aggressive unless you were defending a townread, but you're aggressive this whole game, regardless if it's defending or not. Can you shine a light onto why you're doing this? I believe the only time I've seen you as scum would be in a hydra with Impoetic, and I did correctly call you out as scum, after I was the day 1 lynch (surprise)</div></blockquote><br><br>I'm pretty sure I've played aggressively before in a game you've been in, the way I was going himiko and Trans in Pantheon mafia? Anyway, you mentioned even in this quote that I hydra'd with Impo as scum. I know her thought process as scum and her reactions, this just isn't it. I know her outside of games too, and I pay attention to her <strike>because i'm a creepy stalker</strike>. It's like the level you can soulread Claire (which I've seen you do before in Penguin mafia). There's just no way Impo is scum, she can't fool me especially when she wasn't even aware if she needed to. Like I never mentioned to her about the diff in her scum and towngames since I didn't play with her after Trial anyways since she quit forum maf.<br><br>If you want meta where I'm aggressive, Double Day Hydra Blitz is a good one, I was Chihiro in the Chihiro and Alter Ego hydra. <!-- l --><a class=\"postlink-local\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=83&amp;t=70181\">viewtopic.php?f=83&amp;t=70181</a><!-- l --><br><br>But there's been a lot of times where I've seen people as conftown from early game (and been right) like Ranger's micro with Charloux and Nahdia, the read on MURDERCAT in Nahdia's mini normal, C9++ on Charloux, Trees newbie on KTS. There's a reason my sig has that Charl quote.<br><br>Anyways<br>1st question: No I do not believe she could be doing anything to fool me, I know her too well.<br>2nd question: Because it's not a possibility.<br>3rd question: Sometimes I feel more aggressive in a game. Sometimes I feel awfully lazy. Depends on how I feel like approaching any given game.<br>4th question: See above.<br><br>Also the statement about calling me correctly as scum, you never did it in the main thread so it didn't matter ;p but also, it was like 5 minutes to deadline with the person who said he'd hammer you not being around and it was D1. Arguably I did the most protown thing there by hammering and I desperately wished I hadn't been awake and posting for it because of that. I would have hammered you as town because a D1 no lynch is awful for town. So thinking I was maf for the hammer is bad reasoning anyway.</div></blockquote><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8991492#p8991492\" class=\"postlink\">post 917</a>, JaeReed wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8991471#p8991471\" class=\"postlink\">post 915</a>, gerryoat wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8990755#p8990755\" class=\"postlink\">post 888</a>, JaeReed wrote:</cite>I'm pretty sure I've played aggressively before in a game you've been in, the way I was going himiko and Trans in Pantheon mafia?</div></blockquote><br><br>Isn't that the one where you were third party and not town?</div></blockquote><br><br>Survivor that could win with town and was playing like a mason because of it, yeah. <br><br>What's your point, gerry?

JaeReed.</span></span></span> There is something that is bothering me about them this game. It's nothing that I can say that is scummy, but based on my past experience with them, they feel.. Different. For once, I want to say that they feel way more aggressive to what I'm used to. I know that they are trying to defend Impoetic, which I can see the reasoning for, but it feels a bit over the top to me. Is it not possible that Impoetic knows that you can read her, and she is specifically doing something to break your read on her? How come there hasn't been any visable thought of you thinking about this as a possibility? <br><br>As I stated earlier, you are being way more aggressive than I am used to. Is there a reason for this? Because the times as town, you really haven't been too aggressive unless you were defending a townread, but you're aggressive this whole game, regardless if it's defending or not. Can you shine a light onto why you're doing this? I believe the only time I've seen you as scum would be in a hydra with Impoetic, and I did correctly call you out as scum, after I was the day 1 lynch (surprise)</div></blockquote><br><br>I'm pretty sure I've played aggressively before in a game you've been in, the way I was going himiko and Trans in Pantheon mafia? Anyway, you mentioned even in this quote that I hydra'd with Impo as scum. I know her thought process as scum and her reactions, this just isn't it. I know her outside of games too, and I pay attention to her <strike>because i'm a creepy stalker</strike>. It's like the level you can soulread Claire (which I've seen you do before in Penguin mafia). There's just no way Impo is scum, she can't fool me especially when she wasn't even aware if she needed to. Like I never mentioned to her about the diff in her scum and towngames since I didn't play with her after Trial anyways since she quit forum maf.<br><br>If you want meta where I'm aggressive, Double Day Hydra Blitz is a good one, I was Chihiro in the Chihiro and Alter Ego hydra. <!-- l --><a class=\"postlink-local\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=83&amp;t=70181\">viewtopic.php?f=83&amp;t=70181</a><!-- l --><br><br>But there's been a lot of times where I've seen people as conftown from early game (and been right) like Ranger's micro with Charloux and Nahdia, the read on MURDERCAT in Nahdia's mini normal, C9++ on Charloux, Trees newbie on KTS. There's a reason my sig has that Charl quote.<br><br>Anyways<br>1st question: No I do not believe she could be doing anything to fool me, I know her too well.<br>2nd question: Because it's not a possibility.<br>3rd question: Sometimes I feel more aggressive in a game. Sometimes I feel awfully lazy. Depends on how I feel like approaching any given game.<br>4th question: See above.<br><br>Also the statement about calling me correctly as scum, you never did it in the main thread so it didn't matter ;p but also, it was like 5 minutes to deadline with the person who said he'd hammer you not being around and it was D1. Arguably I did the most protown thing there by hammering and I desperately wished I hadn't been awake and posting for it because of that. I would have hammered you as town because a D1 no lynch is awful for town. So thinking I was maf for the hammer is bad reasoning anyway.</div></blockquote><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8991492#p8991492\" class=\"postlink\">post 917</a>, JaeReed wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8991471#p8991471\" class=\"postlink\">post 915</a>, gerryoat wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8990755#p8990755\" class=\"postlink\">post 888</a>, JaeReed wrote:</cite>I'm pretty sure I've played aggressively before in a game you've been in, the way I was going himiko and Trans in Pantheon mafia?</div></blockquote><br><br>Isn't that the one where you were third party and not town?</div></blockquote><br><br>Survivor that could win with town and was playing like a mason because of it, yeah. <br><br>What's your point, gerry?

JaeReed.</span></span></span> There is something that is bothering me about them this game. It's nothing that I can say that is scummy, but based on my past experience with them, they feel.. Different. For once, I want to say that they feel way more aggressive to what I'm used to. I know that they are trying to defend Impoetic, which I can see the reasoning for, but it feels a bit over the top to me. Is it not possible that Impoetic knows that you can read her, and she is specifically doing something to break your read on her? How come there hasn't been any visable thought of you thinking about this as a possibility? <br><br>As I stated earlier, you are being way more aggressive than I am used to. Is there a reason for this? Because the times as town, you really haven't been too aggressive unless you were defending a townread, but you're aggressive this whole game, regardless if it's defending or not. Can you shine a light onto why you're doing this? I believe the only time I've seen you as scum would be in a hydra with Impoetic, and I did correctly call you out as scum, after I was the day 1 lynch (surprise)</div></blockquote><br><br>I'm pretty sure I've played aggressively before in a game you've been in, the way I was going himiko and Trans in Pantheon mafia? Anyway, you mentioned even in this quote that I hydra'd with Impo as scum. I know her thought process as scum and her reactions, this just isn't it. I know her outside of games too, and I pay attention to her <strike>because i'm a creepy stalker</strike>. It's like the level you can soulread Claire (which I've seen you do before in Penguin mafia). There's just no way Impo is scum, she can't fool me especially when she wasn't even aware if she needed to. Like I never mentioned to her about the diff in her scum and towngames since I didn't play with her after Trial anyways since she quit forum maf.<br><br>If you want meta where I'm aggressive, Double Day Hydra Blitz is a good one, I was Chihiro in the Chihiro and Alter Ego hydra. <!-- l --><a class=\"postlink-local\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=83&amp;t=70181\">viewtopic.php?f=83&amp;t=70181</a><!-- l --><br><br>But there's been a lot of times where I've seen people as conftown from early game (and been right) like Ranger's micro with Charloux and Nahdia, the read on MURDERCAT in Nahdia's mini normal, C9++ on Charloux, Trees newbie on KTS. There's a reason my sig has that Charl quote.<br><br>Anyways<br>1st question: No I do not believe she could be doing anything to fool me, I know her too well.<br>2nd question: Because it's not a possibility.<br>3rd question: Sometimes I feel more aggressive in a game. Sometimes I feel awfully lazy. Depends on how I feel like approaching any given game.<br>4th question: See above.<br><br>Also the statement about calling me correctly as scum, you never did it in the main thread so it didn't matter ;p but also, it was like 5 minutes to deadline with the person who said he'd hammer you not being around and it was D1. Arguably I did the most protown thing there by hammering and I desperately wished I hadn't been awake and posting for it because of that. I would have hammered you as town because a D1 no lynch is awful for town. So thinking I was maf for the hammer is bad reasoning anyway.</div></blockquote><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8991492#p8991492\" class=\"postlink\">post 917</a>, JaeReed wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8991471#p8991471\" class=\"postlink\">post 915</a>, gerryoat wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8990755#p8990755\" class=\"postlink\">post 888</a>, JaeReed wrote:</cite>I'm pretty sure I've played aggressively before in a game you've been in, the way I was going himiko and Trans in Pantheon mafia?</div></blockquote><br><br>Isn't that the one where you were third party and not town?</div></blockquote><br><br>Survivor that could win with town and was playing like a mason because of it, yeah. <br><br>What's your point, gerry?

I really want to see more from that slot.</div></blockquote><br>I want to see the reasoning behind the scumread. Without an investigative result or a flip, I don't know anyone's alignment but my own. With an anchor in myself, I can judge other players' reasons for their reads on my slot better than I can judge reads on others. (Not that I don't like to probe for meaning in reads on others, too, if for nothing else but reference after a flip)<br><br>My reason for leaning scum on you is multifold (and in no particular order). 1) In my experience, people using the reasoning style you display will usually prefer to have someone to bounce ideas around with. In reading the thread, I've seen no attempts on your part to collaborate. It suggests you don't want to do much solving. 2) You flipped from voting me, to voting someone else, and scumreading me by proxy, to town reading me. You did this far too quickly for comfort. 3) You seem to prefer to antagonize thin air. It looks more like someone searching for lynchbait than someone hunting scum. <br><br>I realize these are mostly intuitive reasons, but again, you're only vying for #2 right now. Contradiction remains #1, as the BP claim is a pretty solid goto for scum. I'll provide updates as reads progress (I haven't even attempted to read everyone yet.. but this thread is/was in desperate need of activity, so I started with what stood out the most)."}

Then I realized that pjm just has a different style: whereas, I like to (at least act like) I have solid town and scum reads on people even early on in the game, pjm prefers to play it safer with light scumreads, null-town reads, stuff like that. That sort of reading generally pings me as scum, but in all honesty it's probably because I just don't play that way myself. I realized this reading into his posts, really all of the posts I was about to talk about are consistent with his light reads thing, and that consistency kind of cleared things up. Pjm doesn't do more than soft reads, and doesn't think it's towny when other people throw crap at each other to see what will happen. Normally I'd think that type of play is super scummy, but the consistency is what convinces me this is just his type of play rather than a particularly scummy one."}

Instead, she posts the opinion as if she wants to egg it on, and puts her vote elsewhere.<br><br>-------------------------------<br><br>Speaking of the Contradiction thing, her vote is all-sorts-of-weird, considering the read-progression that she's had on the Darklyn slot:<br><br>In #1340, she asks Dunn for the rationale of her vote on Darklyn.  There's no opinion given on Darklyn's alignment, but this suggests that she doesn't understand why people are reading Darklyn as scum.<br>In #1480, she expresses that she was previously reading Darklyn as scum, but has slowly changed her mind. <br>In #1542, she reads Darklyn as \"townlike.\"<br>In #1576, she votes Contradiction (Darklyn's replacement) because she didn't like Contradictions' claim.  <br><br>There are some really janky things about this read progression:<br>1) She was reading Darklyn as pretty townie, and has very little reservation voting his replacement.<br>2) #1480 doesn't read as very genuine, since she had never expressed concern about Darklyn being scum to that point.  It's like she makes up the read out of thin air.<br>3) Reading Darklyn town that confidently is pretty strange, because he's a very lynchbaity player that's hard to read.<br><br>---------------------------------------<br><br>All and all, I'm pretty happy lynching here today.  I think the way she's treating the Gerry vs. Trium argument is a lot like Scum sitting back and watching two townies fight to the death.

Her read progression on Darklyn/Contradiction/ThinkBig makes very little sense, and looks very fabricated.</div></blockquote><br><br>BTW this read very much as town trying to scum hunt,,,,,,,,NOt sure if I agree with Hapa here.....

It's the only way I know how to solve things. Take three people with the same role and they'll do three different things. Because nearly all actions, opinions, and votes can be reduced to \"NAI\". Motive that holds the key to someone's alignment. So it's motive that I try to bore down to.

That is, when I'm not doing something that's hindered by transparency. Either way, I'm a collaborative thinker. It's how I \"town\".

But that's why scum like to claim BP. It's unverifiable, and intimidates town away from the slot. It was claimed in just about the scumiest way possible. What took me off the slot was the knowledge that ThinkBig always seems scummy to me, majorly. That, and Momo sticking with his vote for a really hollow reason.

He did similar things with other members. Like just assuming Dunn is wrong-town, when there should be at least a twinkle of a scum-suspicion.

I went through all the effort of slogging through a few of your games, so the least I could do was report back to the other players here.

It makes you \"feel\" scummy. That doesn't necessarily mean you must be scum, but it contributes to your tone. This is as opposed to Gerry, who has a smoother (or arguably slimier) tone. He appears more nonchalant. Less awkward = less jumpy = less personally invested in whether or not he gets lynched = a more town tone (according to MS meta). Of course, just ple town can feel awkward, his attitude can be faked (and should be, if you want to get by as scum). <br><br>So I guess that line was there to say that in the way of tone you're very different, but in my current tinfoil state, you're more or less equal.<br><br>@Math - I think if Gerry's scum, I'd say Momo is my first suspect, and Delta is my second. If IAWS is scum, then it's a toss-up between Fuzzy and Delta. Delta has felt pretty awkward and opportunistic for a good while now, and he keeps pinging me (but not necessarily i connection with others). I just hate committing to scum reads on tone alone because I know a town role-assignment doesn't magically transform someone into some charismatic scum-hunting phenom."}
