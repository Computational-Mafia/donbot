Do not ruin the game for others.<br>\n</li><li> If you have something that you need to communicate with me <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">bold</div> your text or I cannot guarantee I will see it.<br>\n</li><li> As the MOD I reserve the right to modkill or force-replace players as I see fit.  <br>\n</li><li> If you feel I have erred send me a PM and let me know.  <br>\n</li><li> That said, do not bring disagreements with me into the thread.  That is what the PM is for.  The same goes for disagreements with other players.<br>\n</li><li> Do not use invisible or in some way encrypted fonts or typing.<br>\n</li><li> Do not quote communications with the moderator (in particular, your role PM).  Quoting the timestamp of your role PM counts as quoting your role PM.

This is my color and only my color.  Don't use it.<br>\n</li><li> A lynch is reached when a majority of all players (half rounded down plus one) are voting for the same target.<br>\n</li><li> If a majority is not reached by the deadline, a No Lynch will occur.<br>\n</li><li> You may vote No Lynch in the same way that you vote for a lynch.  Once a majority has voted for a no lynch the day immediately ends.  <br>\n</li><li> Abuse of an infinite no-lynch/no-kill loop will not be tolerated.  Do not even contemplate it.<br>\n</li><li> Votes must be written in <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">bold</div> as <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: Player</div> or use the <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Player</span> tag.  Votes that are not bolded or tagged will not be counted. <br>\n</li><li> Votes in quotes, spoiler tags or otherwise hidden will also not be counted.<br>\n</li><li> Votes that misspell or have other minor errors will be counted as normal as long as I understand what you are getting at.<br>\n</li><li> Unvotes are helpful, but not necessary.  Let me know if I make an error in vote counts and I will correct them.<br>\n</li><li> I will try and do vote counts often but if you want one just let me know.  In general, I will be mainly available evenings (5 PM - 12 PM Pacific) and weekends, so you may not get a quick VC if it's in the middle of the day.<br>\n</li><li> As the MOD I will keep communication down to the absolute minimum possible (aside from vote counts and the like).

Regardless, I still think the read is likely to be forced.

I don't really think jaereed would actively try to have their reads agree with everyone else as scum, but maybe they'd be biased towards it?

There are a couple of things that I want to go over, before I do eventually vote. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#4000FF\">1. JaeReed.</div></div> There is something that is bothering me about them this game. It's nothing that I can say that is scummy, but based on my past experience with them, they feel.. Different. For once, I want to say that they feel way more aggressive to what I'm used to. I know that they are trying to defend Impoetic, which I can see the reasoning for, but it feels a bit over the top to me. Is it not possible that Impoetic knows that you can read her, and she is specifically doing something to break your read on her? How come there hasn't been any visable thought of you thinking about this as a possibility? <br>\n<br>\nAs I stated earlier, you are being way more aggressive than I am used to. Is there a reason for this? Because the times as town, you really haven't been too aggressive unless you were defending a townread, but you're aggressive this whole game, regardless if it's defending or not. Can you shine a light onto why you're doing this? I believe the only time I've seen you as scum would be in a hydra with Impoetic, and I did correctly call you out as scum, after I was the day 1 lynch (surprise)<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#4000FF\">2. Nancy.</div></div> One thing that pinged me very quickly was when you seemed to suddenly defend me out of nowhere, why am I obvious town to you? If I remember correctly, we have played a game or two together, and if I remember correctly you've read me wrong each of those games? How come the thought process of that fact that you've read me wrong before, mean that you could be wrong about me now? Shouldn't it be weird that you find me as a townread when before when I was town you were always scumreading me?<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#4000FF\">3. Alisae.</div> </div>How do you feel about the fact that Jae scumreads you so much? If I remember correctly, they've read you wrong before when I was mafia and you were both town. How come the thought process hasn't crossed their mind that they could be wrong again? Isn't that something you would expect? Why have you not brought that up? (If you have, sorry I must have missed it)<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#4000FF\">4. Darklyn.</div></div> From what I've seen, it seems you have been given some townreads by certain people randomly, yet you haven't really questioned anyone for why they townread you. Why is this? Are you not afraid that mafia could be trying to pocket a potential mislynch town the road? Your iso and content does not warrant the TRs that you have gotten, and even you should know that yourself.", "time": "Thu Mar 16, 2017 10:22 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=71047&start=775", "forum": "53", "thread": "71047"}

JaeReed.</div></div> There is something that is bothering me about them this game. It's nothing that I can say that is scummy, but based on my past experience with them, they feel.. Different. For once, I want to say that they feel way more aggressive to what I'm used to. I know that they are trying to defend Impoetic, which I can see the reasoning for, but it feels a bit over the top to me. Is it not possible that Impoetic knows that you can read her, and she is specifically doing something to break your read on her? How come there hasn't been any visable thought of you thinking about this as a possibility? <br>\n<br>\nAs I stated earlier, you are being way more aggressive than I am used to. Is there a reason for this? Because the times as town, you really haven't been too aggressive unless you were defending a townread, but you're aggressive this whole game, regardless if it's defending or not. Can you shine a light onto why you're doing this? I believe the only time I've seen you as scum would be in a hydra with Impoetic, and I did correctly call you out as scum, after I was the day 1 lynch (surprise)</div></blockquote>\n\nI'm pretty sure I've played aggressively before in a game you've been in, the way I was going himiko and Trans in Pantheon mafia? Anyway, you mentioned even in this quote that I hydra'd with Impo as scum. I know her thought process as scum and her reactions, this just isn't it. I know her outside of games too, and I pay attention to her <div style=\"display:inline-flex;text-decoration:line-through\">because i'm a creepy stalker</div>. It's like the level you can soulread Claire (which I've seen you do before in Penguin mafia). There's just no way Impo is scum, she can't fool me especially when she wasn't even aware if she needed to. Like I never mentioned to her about the diff in her scum and towngames since I didn't play with her after Trial anyways since she quit forum maf.<br>\n<br>\nIf you want meta where I'm aggressive, Double Day Hydra Blitz is a good one, I was Chihiro in the Chihiro and Alter Ego hydra. <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=83&amp;t=70181\" class=\"postlink\">viewtopic.php?f=83&amp;t=70181</a><br>\n<br>\nBut there's been a lot of times where I've seen people as conftown from early game (and been right) like Ranger's micro with Charloux and Nahdia, the read on MURDERCAT in Nahdia's mini normal, C9++ on Charloux, Trees newbie on KTS. There's a reason my sig has that Charl quote.<br>\n<br>\nAnyways<br>\n1st question: No I do not believe she could be doing anything to fool me, I know her too well.<br>\n2nd question: Because it's not a possibility.<br>\n3rd question: Sometimes I feel more aggressive in a game. Sometimes I feel awfully lazy. Depends on how I feel like approaching any given game.<br>\n4th question: See above.<br>\n<br>\nAlso the statement about calling me correctly as scum, you never did it in the main thread so it didn't matter ;p but also, it was like 5 minutes to deadline with the person who said he'd hammer you not being around and it was D1. Arguably I did the most protown thing there by hammering and I desperately wished I hadn't been awake and posting for it because of that. I would have hammered you as town because a D1 no lynch is awful for town. So thinking I was maf for the hammer is bad reasoning anyway.", "time": "Fri Mar 17, 2017 2:41 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=71047&start=875", "forum": "53", "thread": "71047"}

JaeReed.</div></div> There is something that is bothering me about them this game. It's nothing that I can say that is scummy, but based on my past experience with them, they feel.. Different. For once, I want to say that they feel way more aggressive to what I'm used to. I know that they are trying to defend Impoetic, which I can see the reasoning for, but it feels a bit over the top to me. Is it not possible that Impoetic knows that you can read her, and she is specifically doing something to break your read on her? How come there hasn't been any visable thought of you thinking about this as a possibility? <br>\n<br>\nAs I stated earlier, you are being way more aggressive than I am used to. Is there a reason for this? Because the times as town, you really haven't been too aggressive unless you were defending a townread, but you're aggressive this whole game, regardless if it's defending or not. Can you shine a light onto why you're doing this? I believe the only time I've seen you as scum would be in a hydra with Impoetic, and I did correctly call you out as scum, after I was the day 1 lynch (surprise)</div></blockquote>\n\nI'm pretty sure I've played aggressively before in a game you've been in, the way I was going himiko and Trans in Pantheon mafia? Anyway, you mentioned even in this quote that I hydra'd with Impo as scum. I know her thought process as scum and her reactions, this just isn't it. I know her outside of games too, and I pay attention to her <div style=\"display:inline-flex;text-decoration:line-through\">because i'm a creepy stalker</div>. It's like the level you can soulread Claire (which I've seen you do before in Penguin mafia). There's just no way Impo is scum, she can't fool me especially when she wasn't even aware if she needed to. Like I never mentioned to her about the diff in her scum and towngames since I didn't play with her after Trial anyways since she quit forum maf.<br>\n<br>\nIf you want meta where I'm aggressive, Double Day Hydra Blitz is a good one, I was Chihiro in the Chihiro and Alter Ego hydra. <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=83&amp;t=70181\" class=\"postlink\">viewtopic.php?f=83&amp;t=70181</a><br>\n<br>\nBut there's been a lot of times where I've seen people as conftown from early game (and been right) like Ranger's micro with Charloux and Nahdia, the read on MURDERCAT in Nahdia's mini normal, C9++ on Charloux, Trees newbie on KTS. There's a reason my sig has that Charl quote.<br>\n<br>\nAnyways<br>\n1st question: No I do not believe she could be doing anything to fool me, I know her too well.<br>\n2nd question: Because it's not a possibility.<br>\n3rd question: Sometimes I feel more aggressive in a game. Sometimes I feel awfully lazy. Depends on how I feel like approaching any given game.<br>\n4th question: See above.<br>\n<br>\nAlso the statement about calling me correctly as scum, you never did it in the main thread so it didn't matter ;p but also, it was like 5 minutes to deadline with the person who said he'd hammer you not being around and it was D1. Arguably I did the most protown thing there by hammering and I desperately wished I hadn't been awake and posting for it because of that. I would have hammered you as town because a D1 no lynch is awful for town. So thinking I was maf for the hammer is bad reasoning anyway.</div></blockquote>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8991492#p8991492\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8991492#p8991492\" data-post-id=\"8991492\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 917</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=27722\">JaeReed</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8991471#p8991471\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8991471#p8991471\" data-post-id=\"8991471\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 915</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=28282\">gerryoat</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8990755#p8990755\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8990755#p8990755\" data-post-id=\"8990755\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 888</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=27722\">JaeReed</a> wrote:</cite>I'm pretty sure I've played aggressively before in a game you've been in, the way I was going himiko and Trans in Pantheon mafia?</div></blockquote>\n\nIsn't that the one where you were third party and not town?</div></blockquote>\n\nSurvivor that could win with town and was playing like a mason because of it, yeah. <br>\n<br>\nWhat's your point, gerry?

JaeReed.</div></div> There is something that is bothering me about them this game. It's nothing that I can say that is scummy, but based on my past experience with them, they feel.. Different. For once, I want to say that they feel way more aggressive to what I'm used to. I know that they are trying to defend Impoetic, which I can see the reasoning for, but it feels a bit over the top to me. Is it not possible that Impoetic knows that you can read her, and she is specifically doing something to break your read on her? How come there hasn't been any visable thought of you thinking about this as a possibility? <br>\n<br>\nAs I stated earlier, you are being way more aggressive than I am used to. Is there a reason for this? Because the times as town, you really haven't been too aggressive unless you were defending a townread, but you're aggressive this whole game, regardless if it's defending or not. Can you shine a light onto why you're doing this? I believe the only time I've seen you as scum would be in a hydra with Impoetic, and I did correctly call you out as scum, after I was the day 1 lynch (surprise)</div></blockquote>\n\nI'm pretty sure I've played aggressively before in a game you've been in, the way I was going himiko and Trans in Pantheon mafia? Anyway, you mentioned even in this quote that I hydra'd with Impo as scum. I know her thought process as scum and her reactions, this just isn't it. I know her outside of games too, and I pay attention to her <div style=\"display:inline-flex;text-decoration:line-through\">because i'm a creepy stalker</div>. It's like the level you can soulread Claire (which I've seen you do before in Penguin mafia). There's just no way Impo is scum, she can't fool me especially when she wasn't even aware if she needed to. Like I never mentioned to her about the diff in her scum and towngames since I didn't play with her after Trial anyways since she quit forum maf.<br>\n<br>\nIf you want meta where I'm aggressive, Double Day Hydra Blitz is a good one, I was Chihiro in the Chihiro and Alter Ego hydra. <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=83&amp;t=70181\" class=\"postlink\">viewtopic.php?f=83&amp;t=70181</a><br>\n<br>\nBut there's been a lot of times where I've seen people as conftown from early game (and been right) like Ranger's micro with Charloux and Nahdia, the read on MURDERCAT in Nahdia's mini normal, C9++ on Charloux, Trees newbie on KTS. There's a reason my sig has that Charl quote.<br>\n<br>\nAnyways<br>\n1st question: No I do not believe she could be doing anything to fool me, I know her too well.<br>\n2nd question: Because it's not a possibility.<br>\n3rd question: Sometimes I feel more aggressive in a game. Sometimes I feel awfully lazy. Depends on how I feel like approaching any given game.<br>\n4th question: See above.<br>\n<br>\nAlso the statement about calling me correctly as scum, you never did it in the main thread so it didn't matter ;p but also, it was like 5 minutes to deadline with the person who said he'd hammer you not being around and it was D1. Arguably I did the most protown thing there by hammering and I desperately wished I hadn't been awake and posting for it because of that. I would have hammered you as town because a D1 no lynch is awful for town. So thinking I was maf for the hammer is bad reasoning anyway.</div></blockquote>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8991492#p8991492\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8991492#p8991492\" data-post-id=\"8991492\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 917</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=27722\">JaeReed</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8991471#p8991471\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8991471#p8991471\" data-post-id=\"8991471\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 915</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=28282\">gerryoat</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8990755#p8990755\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8990755#p8990755\" data-post-id=\"8990755\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 888</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=27722\">JaeReed</a> wrote:</cite>I'm pretty sure I've played aggressively before in a game you've been in, the way I was going himiko and Trans in Pantheon mafia?</div></blockquote>\n\nIsn't that the one where you were third party and not town?</div></blockquote>\n\nSurvivor that could win with town and was playing like a mason because of it, yeah. <br>\n<br>\nWhat's your point, gerry?

It's like the level you can soulread Claire (which I've seen you do before in Penguin mafia). There's just no way Impo is scum, she can't fool me especially when she wasn't even aware if she needed to.

There's a reason my sig has that Charl quote.<br>\n<br>\nAnyways<br>\n1st question: No I do not believe she could be doing anything to fool me, I know her too well.<br>\n2nd question: Because it's not a possibility.<br>\n3rd question: Sometimes I feel more aggressive in a game. Sometimes I feel awfully lazy. Depends on how I feel like approaching any given game.<br>\n4th question: See above.<br>\n<br>\nAlso the statement about calling me correctly as scum, you never did it in the main thread so it didn't matter ;p but also, it was like 5 minutes to deadline with the person who said he'd hammer you not being around and it was D1. Arguably I did the most protown thing there by hammering and I desperately wished I hadn't been awake and posting for it because of that. I would have hammered you as town because a D1 no lynch is awful for town.

Like I never mentioned to her about the diff in her scum and towngames since I didn't play with her after Trial anyways since she quit forum maf.<br>\n<br>\nIf you want meta where I'm aggressive, Double Day Hydra Blitz is a good one, I was Chihiro in the Chihiro and Alter Ego hydra. <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=83&amp;t=70181\" class=\"postlink\">viewtopic.php?f=83&amp;t=70181</a><br>\n<br>\nBut there's been a lot of times where I've seen people as conftown from early game (and been right) like Ranger's micro with Charloux and Nahdia, the read on MURDERCAT in Nahdia's mini normal, C9++ on Charloux, Trees newbie on KTS. There's a reason my sig has that Charl quote.<br>\n<br>\nAnyways<br>\n1st question: No I do not believe she could be doing anything to fool me, I know her too well.<br>\n2nd question: Because it's not a possibility.<br>\n3rd question: Sometimes I feel more aggressive in a game. Sometimes I feel awfully lazy. Depends on how I feel like approaching any given game.<br>\n4th question: See above.<br>\n<br>\nAlso the statement about calling me correctly as scum, you never did it in the main thread so it didn't matter ;p but also, it was like 5 minutes to deadline with the person who said he'd hammer you not being around and it was D1. Arguably I did the most protown thing there by hammering and I desperately wished I hadn't been awake and posting for it because of that. I would have hammered you as town because a D1 no lynch is awful for town. So thinking I was maf for the hammer is bad reasoning anyway.</div></blockquote>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8991492#p8991492\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8991492#p8991492\" data-post-id=\"8991492\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 917</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=27722\">JaeReed</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8991471#p8991471\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8991471#p8991471\" data-post-id=\"8991471\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 915</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=28282\">gerryoat</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8990755#p8990755\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8990755#p8990755\" data-post-id=\"8990755\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 888</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=27722\">JaeReed</a> wrote:</cite>I'm pretty sure I've played aggressively before in a game you've been in, the way I was going himiko and Trans in Pantheon mafia?</div></blockquote>\n\nIsn't that the one where you were third party and not town?</div></blockquote>\n\nSurvivor that could win with town and was playing like a mason because of it, yeah. <br>\n<br>\nWhat's your point, gerry?

JaeReed.</div></div> There is something that is bothering me about them this game. It's nothing that I can say that is scummy, but based on my past experience with them, they feel.. Different. For once, I want to say that they feel way more aggressive to what I'm used to. I know that they are trying to defend Impoetic, which I can see the reasoning for, but it feels a bit over the top to me. Is it not possible that Impoetic knows that you can read her, and she is specifically doing something to break your read on her? How come there hasn't been any visable thought of you thinking about this as a possibility? <br>\n<br>\nAs I stated earlier, you are being way more aggressive than I am used to. Is there a reason for this? Because the times as town, you really haven't been too aggressive unless you were defending a townread, but you're aggressive this whole game, regardless if it's defending or not. Can you shine a light onto why you're doing this? I believe the only time I've seen you as scum would be in a hydra with Impoetic, and I did correctly call you out as scum, after I was the day 1 lynch (surprise)</div></blockquote>\n\nI'm pretty sure I've played aggressively before in a game you've been in, the way I was going himiko and Trans in Pantheon mafia? Anyway, you mentioned even in this quote that I hydra'd with Impo as scum. I know her thought process as scum and her reactions, this just isn't it. I know her outside of games too, and I pay attention to her <div style=\"display:inline-flex;text-decoration:line-through\">because i'm a creepy stalker</div>. It's like the level you can soulread Claire (which I've seen you do before in Penguin mafia). There's just no way Impo is scum, she can't fool me especially when she wasn't even aware if she needed to. Like I never mentioned to her about the diff in her scum and towngames since I didn't play with her after Trial anyways since she quit forum maf.<br>\n<br>\nIf you want meta where I'm aggressive, Double Day Hydra Blitz is a good one, I was Chihiro in the Chihiro and Alter Ego hydra. <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=83&amp;t=70181\" class=\"postlink\">viewtopic.php?f=83&amp;t=70181</a><br>\n<br>\nBut there's been a lot of times where I've seen people as conftown from early game (and been right) like Ranger's micro with Charloux and Nahdia, the read on MURDERCAT in Nahdia's mini normal, C9++ on Charloux, Trees newbie on KTS. There's a reason my sig has that Charl quote.<br>\n<br>\nAnyways<br>\n1st question: No I do not believe she could be doing anything to fool me, I know her too well.<br>\n2nd question: Because it's not a possibility.<br>\n3rd question: Sometimes I feel more aggressive in a game. Sometimes I feel awfully lazy. Depends on how I feel like approaching any given game.<br>\n4th question: See above.<br>\n<br>\nAlso the statement about calling me correctly as scum, you never did it in the main thread so it didn't matter ;p but also, it was like 5 minutes to deadline with the person who said he'd hammer you not being around and it was D1. Arguably I did the most protown thing there by hammering and I desperately wished I hadn't been awake and posting for it because of that. I would have hammered you as town because a D1 no lynch is awful for town.

With an anchor in myself, I can judge other players' reasons for their reads on my slot better than I can judge reads on others. (Not that I don't like to probe for meaning in reads on others, too, if for nothing else but reference after a flip)<br>\n<br>\nMy reason for leaning scum on you is multifold (and in no particular order). 1) In my experience, people using the reasoning style you display will usually prefer to have someone to bounce ideas around with. In reading the thread, I've seen no attempts on your part to collaborate. It suggests you don't want to do much solving. 2) You flipped from voting me, to voting someone else, and scumreading me by proxy, to town reading me. You did this far too quickly for comfort. 3) You seem to prefer to antagonize thin air. It looks more like someone searching for lynchbait than someone hunting scum. <br>\n<br>\nI realize these are mostly intuitive reasons, but again, you're only vying for #2 right now. Contradiction remains #1, as the BP claim is a pretty solid goto for scum.

Then I realized that pjm just has a different style: whereas, I like to (at least act like) I have solid town and scum reads on people even early on in the game, pjm prefers to play it safer with light scumreads, null-town reads, stuff like that. That sort of reading generally pings me as scum, but in all honesty it's probably because I just don't play that way myself. I realized this reading into his posts, really all of the posts I was about to talk about are consistent with his light reads thing, and that consistency kind of cleared things up. Pjm doesn't do more than soft reads, and doesn't think it's towny when other people throw crap at each other to see what will happen. Normally I'd think that type of play is super scummy, but the consistency is what convinces me this is just his type of play rather than a particularly scummy one.", "time": "Thu Mar 30, 2017 11:10 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=71047&start=1700", "forum": "53", "thread": "71047"}

Instead, she posts the opinion as if she wants to egg it on, and puts her vote elsewhere.<br>\n<br>\n-------------------------------<br>\n<br>\nSpeaking of the Contradiction thing, her vote is all-sorts-of-weird, considering the read-progression that she's had on the Darklyn slot:<br>\n<br>\nIn #1340, she asks Dunn for the rationale of her vote on Darklyn.  There's no opinion given on Darklyn's alignment, but this suggests that she doesn't understand why people are reading Darklyn as scum.<br>\nIn #1480, she expresses that she was previously reading Darklyn as scum, but has slowly changed her mind. <br>\nIn #1542, she reads Darklyn as \"townlike.\"<br>\nIn #1576, she votes Contradiction (Darklyn's replacement) because she didn't like Contradictions' claim.  <br>\n<br>\nThere are some really janky things about this read progression:<br>\n1) She was reading Darklyn as pretty townie, and has very little reservation voting his replacement.<br>\n2) #1480 doesn't read as very genuine, since she had never expressed concern about Darklyn being scum to that point.  It's like she makes up the read out of thin air.<br>\n3) Reading Darklyn town that confidently is pretty strange, because he's a very lynchbaity player that's hard to read.<br>\n<br>\n---------------------------------------<br>\n<br>\nAll and all, I'm pretty happy lynching here today.

There's no opinion given on Darklyn's alignment, but this suggests that she doesn't understand why people are reading Darklyn as scum.<br>\nIn #1480, she expresses that she was previously reading Darklyn as scum, but has slowly changed her mind. <br>\nIn #1542, she reads Darklyn as \"townlike.\"<br>\nIn #1576, she votes Contradiction (Darklyn's replacement) because she didn't like Contradictions' claim.  <br>\n<br>\nThere are some really janky things about this read progression:<br>\n1) She was reading Darklyn as pretty townie, and has very little reservation voting his replacement.<br>\n2) #1480 doesn't read as very genuine, since she had never expressed concern about Darklyn being scum to that point.  It's like she makes up the read out of thin air.<br>\n3) Reading Darklyn town that confidently is pretty strange, because he's a very lynchbaity player that's hard to read.<br>\n<br>\n---------------------------------------<br>\n<br>\nAll and all, I'm pretty happy lynching here today.

You've been neutral toward each other, despite having opposite reads.

That doesn't necessarily mean you must be scum, but it contributes to your tone. This is as opposed to Gerry, who has a smoother (or arguably slimier) tone. He appears more nonchalant. Less awkward = less jumpy = less personally invested in whether or not he gets lynched = a more town tone (according to MS meta). Of course, just ple town can feel awkward, his attitude can be faked (and should be, if you want to get by as scum). <br>\n<br>\nSo I guess that line was there to say that in the way of tone you're very different, but in my current tinfoil state, you're more or less equal.<br>\n<br>\n@Math - I think if Gerry's scum, I'd say Momo is my first suspect, and Delta is my second.
