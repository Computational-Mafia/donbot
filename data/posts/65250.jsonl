Now, <span style=\"color: #FF0000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Redville</span></span> is a tiny town, but has many big problems.

As such, don't use any randomness when deciding your vote!</li><li>As a law-abiding capitalist, you are expected to know and follow all laws and regulations set forth by our generous mafiascum lawmakers. </li><li>If you have an accusation, you must bring it forth in an official manner like our forefather Joseph McCarthy did!

No finicky or tricky votes are allowed. </li><li>All capitalists are expected to show up on time to every meeting, and be seen working. I will give out prods at 2 day (48 hour) intervals. Get 2 prods in a day and the next one will be a replacement. Get a third one the next day, and the next is a replacement. After 5 total prods, you will be replaced with extreme prejudice. Capitalists must be prudent!</li><li>As a civilized capitalist, I will offer you vacation time(not that I have a choice). However, if your vacation will last more than 2 weeks, then perhaps this job is not for you!

The opposite is usually true with being bad it's normally a town thing scum are normally in the middle or really good with there fake reads. It's rare to see scum attack everyone. With the former you can mistake town as doing these things that's why you have to look for them doing it consistently and other scummy behaviors mixed in. No one thing makes someone one scum just everything all together.<br><br>Tbh it doesn't matter what's in the scum read only if it's scummy behavior.

Crumbing is dropping hints about your role in the things you say. Not in the actual syntax of it. <br><br>e.g.<br><br>This is <span class=\"noboldsig\">crumbing</span>: \"I'm 100% positive that ___ is mafia.

That's a cryptic message.<br><br><br><br>tl;dr cryptic messages are \"puzzles\", more or less. Crumbing is merely letting people make implications.</div></blockquote><br>You can say what you want in your game but IMO what you call a cryptic message is a crumb (and wiki agrees IIRC) and what you call a crumb is a soft claim."}

In Chapter 2 of his 1671 work \"Methodus fluxionum et Serierum Infinitarum\",[1] Isaac Newton listed three kinds of differential equations:<br><br>\\frac {dy}{dx} = f(x) <br>\\frac {dy}{dx} = f(x,y)<br>x_1 \\frac {\\partial y}{\\partial x_1} + x_2 \\frac {\\partial y}{\\partial x_2} = y<br>He solves these examples and others using infinite series and discusses the non-uniqueness of solutions.<br><br>Jacob Bernoulli proposed the Bernoulli differential equation in 1695.[2] This is an ordinary differential equation of the form<br><br>y'+ P(x)y = Q(x)y^n\\,<br>for which the following year Leibniz obtained solutions by simplifying it.[3]<br><br>Historically, the problem of a vibrating string such as that of a musical instrument was studied by Jean le Rond d'Alembert, Leonhard Euler, Daniel Bernoulli, and Joseph-Louis Lagrange.[4][5][6][7] In 1746, d\u2019Alembert discovered the one-dimensional wave equation, and within ten years Euler discovered the three-dimensional wave equation.[8]<br><br>The Euler\u2013Lagrange equation was developed in the 1750s by Euler and Lagrange in connection with their studies of the tautochrone problem. This is the problem of determining a curve on which a weighted particle will fall to a fixed point in a fixed amount of time, independent of the starting point.<br><br>Lagrange solved this problem in 1755 and sent the solution to Euler. Both further developed Lagrange's method and applied it to mechanics, which led to the formulation of Lagrangian mechanics.<br><br>Fourier published his work on heat flow in Th\u00e9orie analytique de la chaleur (The Analytic Theory of Heat),[9] in which he based his reasoning on Newton's law of cooling, namely, that the flow of heat between two adjacent molecules is proportional to the extremely small difference of their temperatures. Contained in this book was Fourier's proposal of his heat equation for conductive diffusion of heat. This partial differential equation is now taught to every student of mathematical physics."}

Also any scum bozo can ask questions what has he done with those questions? Nothing he has done nothing his reads didn't update he doesn't show what he thinks of the answers nothing.
