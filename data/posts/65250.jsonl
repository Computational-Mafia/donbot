The opposite is usually true with being bad it's normally a town thing scum are normally in the middle or really good with there fake reads. It's rare to see scum attack everyone. With the former you can mistake town as doing these things that's why you have to look for them doing it consistently and other scummy behaviors mixed in. No one thing makes someone one scum just everything all together.<br>\n<br>\nTbh it doesn't matter what's in the scum read only if it's scummy behavior.

In Chapter 2 of his 1671 work \"Methodus fluxionum et Serierum Infinitarum\",[1] Isaac Newton listed three kinds of differential equations:<br>\n<br>\n\\frac {dy}{dx} = f(x) <br>\n\\frac {dy}{dx} = f(x,y)<br>\nx_1 \\frac {\\partial y}{\\partial x_1} + x_2 \\frac {\\partial y}{\\partial x_2} = y<br>\nHe solves these examples and others using infinite series and discusses the non-uniqueness of solutions.<br>\n<br>\nJacob Bernoulli proposed the Bernoulli differential equation in 1695.[2] This is an ordinary differential equation of the form<br>\n<br>\ny'+ P(x)y = Q(x)y^n\\,<br>\nfor which the following year Leibniz obtained solutions by simplifying it.[3]<br>\n<br>\nHistorically, the problem of a vibrating string such as that of a musical instrument was studied by Jean le Rond d'Alembert, Leonhard Euler, Daniel Bernoulli, and Joseph-Louis Lagrange.[4][5][6][7] In 1746, d&#8217;Alembert discovered the one-dimensional wave equation, and within ten years Euler discovered the three-dimensional wave equation.[8]<br>\n<br>\nThe Euler&#8211;Lagrange equation was developed in the 1750s by Euler and Lagrange in connection with their studies of the tautochrone problem. This is the problem of determining a curve on which a weighted particle will fall to a fixed point in a fixed amount of time, independent of the starting point.<br>\n<br>\nLagrange solved this problem in 1755 and sent the solution to Euler. Both further developed Lagrange's method and applied it to mechanics, which led to the formulation of Lagrangian mechanics.<br>\n<br>\nFourier published his work on heat flow in Th&#233;orie analytique de la chaleur (The Analytic Theory of Heat),[9] in which he based his reasoning on Newton's law of cooling, namely, that the flow of heat between two adjacent molecules is proportional to the extremely small difference of their temperatures. Contained in this book was Fourier's proposal of his heat equation for conductive diffusion of heat. This partial differential equation is now taught to every student of mathematical physics.", "time": "Sat Feb 20, 2016 8:26 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=65250&start=650", "forum": "53", "thread": "65250"}
