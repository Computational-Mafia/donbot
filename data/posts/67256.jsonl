The quote change posts struck me as if he was thinking too much about how he was putting his words, especially on a post that looked like it was trying to be townie by saying he didn't give a shit what the other person had to say or whatever, which not only is pretty irritating but also LAMIST. \"You're right, this is my scum play\" and \"Welp, lynch me\" is the sort of posts that mafioso has been putting out repetitively, in a kind of baiting manner. From all the games I've played, that type of \"welp, lynch me\" always comes from scum. It's scum trying to act townie by trying to make it obvious that they don't care about being lynched, which while it is townie when done sparsely, if it's repetitive like this it's scummy."}

The quote change posts struck me as if he was thinking too much about how he was putting his words, especially on a post that looked like it was trying to be townie by saying he didn't give a shit what the other person had to say or whatever, which not only is pretty irritating but also LAMIST. \"You're right, this is my scum play\" and \"Welp, lynch me\" is the sort of posts that mafioso has been putting out repetitively, in a kind of baiting manner. From all the games I've played, that type of \"welp, lynch me\" always comes from scum. It's scum trying to act townie by trying to make it obvious that they don't care about being lynched, which while it is townie when done sparsely, if it's repetitive like this it's scummy.</div></blockquote><br><br>Sounds like an NAI playstyle thing to me.

I am saying people who just handwave a super scummy looking person as \"dumb town\" ping me because that's an easy way to give an opinion on your partner who is under pressure without flat out defending them. You've been trying to discredit the confirmed town for a while now, which comes across as completely scummy, if you must know. If you think I'm wrong then engage with me on why I'm wrong with actual reasons that aren't just \"hurr you're wrong I'm right even though my cursory not-quite-answers to Murder actually support your theory and not mine because WIFOM\". Guess what? I can do that too. Occam's razor. The simple explanation is often the correct one. Simple explanations? <br>JJD is town because he's not trying to look town and instead trying to scumhunt and apply pressure where it's needed. <br>Accountant is town for having the exact same thought process as me, the confirmed town. <br>Murder is town because my experience with Murder tells me he's town. <br>I can throw what you're doing with your WIFOM argument right back at you by using a different one.<br>2) You look like lost town with your lack of townreads... and I still want to lynch you because at this stage you're noisy and cluttering the thread with the most useless posts I have ever seen come from town OR mafia."}

Here are my current reads:<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #00FF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Town</span></span></span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Accountant</span>- I think Accountant is one of those players that I tend to genuinely disagree with a lot. I've played in one game with him (he was town), and I'm getting the exact same feeling about him now.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Bacde</span>- His \"Let's lynch Xkfyu as a joke\" stuff makes him look inconcerned about how people view him. Post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8076474#p8076474\">186</a> feels super townie to me. Plus, he shares my Trivium scum read.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">iraonavp</span>- RVS or not, I still really like <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8073470#p8073470\">8</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8073489#p8073489\">10</a>. Also, as I said in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8090806#p8090806\">560</a>, I'm pretty sure ira is town.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">JarJarDrinks</span>- Even though I'm less convinced about pacman now, not only did I agree with JJD's points about him in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8083203#p8083203\">245</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8084556#p8084556\">271</a>, and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8084599#p8084599\">275</a>, it also showed that JJD was actively thinking and doing a lot of reading. Which is exactly what I would expect from a town JJD.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">MURDERCAT</span>- I think Accountant's play style would generally make him an easy target for a mislynch. So, I like the way MC pointed out, in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8087154#p8087154\">338</a> that what Tam was talking about with Accountant is NAI, instead of agreeing with her and possibly pushing on Accountant. That's a pretty minor thing, but I do really like the effort that he's put in, and his pressure on ira was good, if a little long.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Town Mafioso</span> - Posts <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8074550#p8074550\">48</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8074560#p8074560\">49</a>, the way he openly talks about a town block, and admitting that his vote on JJD was a chainsaw vote, makes me think he's probably town. What I said in the beginning of <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8090971#p8090971\">564</a> still stands, as well.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Null</span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">evilpacman18</span>- I skimmed over this post in my first read through because of how cluttered it is, but looking back, it comes accross as totally genuine to me. Which makes me wonder if he shouldn't be in the town pile. I just can't ignore the points on him that JJD mentioned.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">I Am Innocent</span> - I know I have the least right out of pretty much everyone here to complain about someone's activity levels, but at least my posts have had some kind of content. I'd be fine with lynching him as a compromise towards the end of the day, assuming he doesn't pick it up/get replaced.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #FF0000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Scum</span></span></span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Tam</span> - So, her second post, post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8086402#p8086402\">306</a>. Remember what I said about Accountant's play style making him an easy target? I also agree with whoever it was that said everything she says is too perfect.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Trivium</span> - I've talked quite a bit recently on why I think Triv is scum. I'd also like to point out that, reading his ISO, I did find another instance, post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8075273#p8075273\">76</a>, where he causually mentions that the IC agrees with him.<br><br>-----------------------------<br><br>So, it seems that I have a lot of town reads, which may suggest that at least one of them is wrong. If I had to chooose someone from my town pile that I was wrong about, I think I'd have to choose either JJD or Bacde. Not because I think either of them has been scummy in any way, but because I think they would probably have the best chance at fooling me."}

He seems to scumread me for using the IC status to try to put more pressure on ira. And I did. I used the IC's status as confirmed town because his opinion is that of confirmed town and means more. That way he was more pressured to actually answer the question, and other people were more likely to sheep the wagon. I just want to add yet again that the dynamics of ira's wagon proved even more that ira was scum- a bunch of probably town players vote and put pressure on him, it slowly builds up with a few other players trying to tear it down with bad reasoning, basically just saying the whole thing is dumb, and then a counterwagon happens to crop up from those players on one of the people voting for ira, who I know is town because that person is me."}

I thought the others's reasons were okay, but pointed out that it was Trivium's reactions to the whole thing that made me vote him. I then tried really hard to help him out, thinking maybe he was a townie who was misunderstood, as I have been in that spot before and it's frustrating. (I said ALL OF THIS BTW. I'm not sure why you guys are saying I never gave my reasons.) You also say, in the post directly after the one you say i am sus in, that you are most suspicious of people who lurked while Trivium was under fire..I was right in the spotlight, trying to figure this all out. Can you explain this further? Because there were only like 3 of us talking at all. Half the town still hasn't shown up and a third ran away and got replacements. <br><br>Also, what did I do that suddenly I am catching votes? I missed something clearly. I would like to point out that while I am being blamed for not giving reasons for my vote, NOT A SINGLE VOTER OF ME IN THIS GAME HAS GIVEN A REASON. They have all just either said Vote...like JaeReed and murder, or said I say all the right things, which is literally the opposite of saying the wrong things. I have asked that these people elaborate but when getting no response from anyone about it, just blew it off, because it didn't seem valid to me.<br><br>Can anyone give me an actual reason why I'm suspicious? Again, it would be nice to have something to actually be able to defend.<br><br>Also, I don't feel my revote of Trivium to have been wishy washy at all. I never said I was unvoting him permanently, I said quite clearly that it was just to see how it all played out, because he finally had taken my advice and tried defending himself instead of whining. When he then flipped out again on the people who he had just convinced to unvote him, it was a major red flag for me. Please note that HE DID NOT ATTACK ME he was after Bacde...who then turned the tables somehow and shifted the blame on me. It was not a defensive move. It was more of an epiphany that he was scum. I still can not even imagine what it is I actually did to look scummy. And since then the two votes I've gotten have not said anything about why they voted me.<br><br>Robb- Saying that being too defensive, or even defensive, is not a thing, is BS. It most certainly is, but has often also been found to be townies that got upset and confused about being blamed wrongly. But don't try and negate the very clear mistakes that your predecessor made.

I quoted a post where he said some negative things about my slot and asked him to point them out to me and he didn't. Instead he said posted a few times why he voted me.

Don't really understand the point of the post actually).

Therefore, there was 5 hours time between the time TM made his first post and the time that he tried to cast shade on JR. Also, TM was actively posting during that 5 hour span.<br>3: Scum have day chat.<br><br>Now, with 3 scum, I don't see how all 3 of them miss the fact that JR is an IC and/or no one mentions it in the scum chat. So, to believe that TM/Sonrio is scum, I think you would have to assume that him casting shade on JR was all staged, and I think that's a stretch.<br><br>And Sonrio is completely null to me.

What do you think?</div></blockquote><br>Oh, I actually read \"Sonia\" as \"Sonrio,\" so that's who I thought you were actually talking about.<br><br>Anyways, about Sonia's \"townslip,\" she would obviously know that she subbed into a mafia slot. She would have received a role card from Nahdia, upon replacing in, and probably would have had to confirm her role by replying to the PM, just like we had to do at the beginning of the game. Like you probably also had to do when you replaced in.<br><br>Now, that doesn't mean that she didn't know who her predecessor was. My first game on site, I replaced into a scum slot in a newbie game as the vote leader (like, at page 10 or something), and I actually did the exact same thing. There had been 3 people in my slot before me, and I think another couple of slots had been replaced, so it was hard to catch up and keep track of who was who. I actually ended up scum reading a couple of my predecessors pretty hard. I didn't actually quote any posts and say why they were scummy, but I did comment on how scummy they had been and no wonder that I was at L-2 (or whatever it was).<br><br>So, it's entirely possible that she isn't faking, and she's still scum. However, 2 minutes after she claimed a scum read on herself, she still \"wonders\" if she is scum reading her own slot, which is plenty of time to go look and correct herself."}

Anyways, I am thinking Jaereed and Iraonavp are pretty scummy for their first few posts in day 2. <br><br>The \"Ohh I am alive\" post kind of gets me thinking that is a scummy way to say \"I need to make it look even I am surprised I am alive\". <br>I am getting town vibes from Impoetic but I am not in agreeance with most of her posts, but they still felt townie. Can't explain, maybe more of a gut thing."}

Here's what is bothering me though, about ira being scum.<br><br>If ira is scum, his continued push on you and MC makes no sense. He's one lynch away from being in LyLo, and he's obviously going to be a lynch candidate today. So, why try to push the IC's two biggest confirmed towns, instead of pushing either Sonrio, or myself (we can't both be his remaining scum buddy), when both of us have had suspicions on us in the past. Why go for the hardest possible lynches at such a critical time, insead of going for the easier mislynch, unless he genuinely believes that you guys are scum?<br><br>Now, in no way do I believe that you are scum. So, the last two scum must be in ira, Sonrio, MC, and Impoetic. So, if ira is town, then it has to be the case that at least one of MC and Impoetic are scum."}
