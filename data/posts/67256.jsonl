I have gotten stuck in this trap myself so I agree that he probably just reads formal and maybe a tad awkward, but it could also be nervousness &amp; defensiveness if he is bad. I don't really have a good read on him yet, but I do find it extremely weird that Accountant jumped on him like that and just won't let up.

I am saying people who just handwave a super scummy looking person as \"dumb town\" ping me because that's an easy way to give an opinion on your partner who is under pressure without flat out defending them. You've been trying to discredit the confirmed town for a while now, which comes across as completely scummy, if you must know. If you think I'm wrong then engage with me on why I'm wrong with actual reasons that aren't just \"hurr you're wrong I'm right even though my cursory not-quite-answers to Murder actually support your theory and not mine because WIFOM\". Guess what? I can do that too. Occam's razor. The simple explanation is often the correct one. Simple explanations? <br>\nJJD is town because he's not trying to look town and instead trying to scumhunt and apply pressure where it's needed. <br>\nAccountant is town for having the exact same thought process as me, the confirmed town. <br>\nMurder is town because my experience with Murder tells me he's town. <br>\nI can throw what you're doing with your WIFOM argument right back at you by using a different one.<br>\n2) You look like lost town with your lack of townreads... and I still want to lynch you because at this stage you're noisy and cluttering the thread with the most useless posts I have ever seen come from town OR mafia.", "time": "Thu Jul 07, 2016 4:22 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=67256&start=500", "forum": "53", "thread": "67256"}

Here are my current reads:<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#00FF00\">Town</div></div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Accountant</div>- I think Accountant is one of those players that I tend to genuinely disagree with a lot. I've played in one game with him (he was town), and I'm getting the exact same feeling about him now.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Bacde</div>- His \"Let's lynch Xkfyu as a joke\" stuff makes him look inconcerned about how people view him. Post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8076474#p8076474\">186</a> feels super townie to me. Plus, he shares my Trivium scum read.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">iraonavp</div>- RVS or not, I still really like <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8073470#p8073470\">8</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8073489#p8073489\">10</a>. Also, as I said in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8090806#p8090806\">560</a>, I'm pretty sure ira is town.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">JarJarDrinks</div>- Even though I'm less convinced about pacman now, not only did I agree with JJD's points about him in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8083203#p8083203\">245</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8084556#p8084556\">271</a>, and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8084599#p8084599\">275</a>, it also showed that JJD was actively thinking and doing a lot of reading. Which is exactly what I would expect from a town JJD.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">MURDERCAT</div>- I think Accountant's play style would generally make him an easy target for a mislynch. So, I like the way MC pointed out, in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8087154#p8087154\">338</a> that what Tam was talking about with Accountant is NAI, instead of agreeing with her and possibly pushing on Accountant. That's a pretty minor thing, but I do really like the effort that he's put in, and his pressure on ira was good, if a little long.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Town Mafioso</div> - Posts <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8074550#p8074550\">48</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8074560#p8074560\">49</a>, the way he openly talks about a town block, and admitting that his vote on JJD was a chainsaw vote, makes me think he's probably town. What I said in the beginning of <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8090971#p8090971\">564</a> still stands, as well.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Null</div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">evilpacman18</div>- I skimmed over this post in my first read through because of how cluttered it is, but looking back, it comes accross as totally genuine to me. Which makes me wonder if he shouldn't be in the town pile. I just can't ignore the points on him that JJD mentioned.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">I Am Innocent</div> - I know I have the least right out of pretty much everyone here to complain about someone's activity levels, but at least my posts have had some kind of content. I'd be fine with lynching him as a compromise towards the end of the day, assuming he doesn't pick it up/get replaced.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF0000\">Scum</div></div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Tam</div> - So, her second post, post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8086402#p8086402\">306</a>. Remember what I said about Accountant's play style making him an easy target? I also agree with whoever it was that said everything she says is too perfect.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Trivium</div> - I've talked quite a bit recently on why I think Triv is scum. I'd also like to point out that, reading his ISO, I did find another instance, post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8075273#p8075273\">76</a>, where he causually mentions that the IC agrees with him.<br>\n<br>\n-----------------------------<br>\n<br>\nSo, it seems that I have a lot of town reads, which may suggest that at least one of them is wrong. If I had to chooose someone from my town pile that I was wrong about, I think I'd have to choose either JJD or Bacde. Not because I think either of them has been scummy in any way, but because I think they would probably have the best chance at fooling me.", "time": "Fri Jul 08, 2016 8:25 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=67256&start=550", "forum": "53", "thread": "67256"}

I quoted a post where he said some negative things about my slot and asked him to point them out to me and he didn't. Instead he said posted a few times why he voted me. His first mention of trivium is post 306 but it's not really a read on him, rather accountant/Ira stuff. 2nd time he mentions him is post 552 where he says he's a good guy (I'm assuming this was sarcasm or something. Don't really understand the point of the post actually). Third time he mentions him is in the post he votes him where he directly quotes the IC who says he wants trivium lynched and says some shit I don't understand which is why I asked him for examples. (Like where did trivium defy tam? How did he defy him? And why is that scummy? What position is tam in to make requests of trivium?  Also what \"shady seeming actions\" did he perceive trivium do?<br>\n<br>\n2. At the time of that post he had 3 votes. His reaction imo seems over the top. He acts like he is at l-2 or something.

I quoted a post where he said some negative things about my slot and asked him to point them out to me and he didn't. Instead he said posted a few times why he voted me. His first mention of trivium is post 306 but it's not really a read on him, rather accountant/Ira stuff. 2nd time he mentions him is post 552 where he says he's a good guy (I'm assuming this was sarcasm or something. Don't really understand the point of the post actually). Third time he mentions him is in the post he votes him where he directly quotes the IC who says he wants trivium lynched and says some shit I don't understand which is why I asked him for examples. (Like where did trivium defy tam? How did he defy him? And why is that scummy? What position is tam in to make requests of trivium?  Also what \"shady seeming actions\" did he perceive trivium do?<br>\n<br>\n2. At the time of that post he had 3 votes. His reaction imo seems over the top. He acts like he is at l-2 or something. Why make a huge post like that instead of coming in and directly asking the people voting him why they are?<br>\n<br>\nAlso this post <br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8095755#p8095755\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8095755#p8095755\" data-post-id=\"8095755\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 724</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=479\">Tam</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8095724#p8095724\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8095724#p8095724\" data-post-id=\"8095724\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 720</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=26322\">Trivium</a> wrote:</cite>Do I get a prize?</div></blockquote>\n\nUmmm yes, you do! <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Trivium</span> Seriously man, I tried so hard to help you figure out what you were doing wrong and correct it, in the hopes that you were innocent and just really misunderstood. <br>\n<br>\nI don't play around with the wishy washy 'you're great, you're horrible' back and forth players.

I'm not sure why you guys are saying I never gave my reasons.) You also say, in the post directly after the one you say i am sus in, that you are most suspicious of people who lurked while Trivium was under fire..I was right in the spotlight, trying to figure this all out. Can you explain this further? Because there were only like 3 of us talking at all. Half the town still hasn't shown up and a third ran away and got replacements. <br>\n<br>\nAlso, what did I do that suddenly I am catching votes? I missed something clearly. I would like to point out that while I am being blamed for not giving reasons for my vote, NOT A SINGLE VOTER OF ME IN THIS GAME HAS GIVEN A REASON. They have all just either said Vote...like JaeReed and murder, or said I say all the right things, which is literally the opposite of saying the wrong things. I have asked that these people elaborate but when getting no response from anyone about it, just blew it off, because it didn't seem valid to me.<br>\n<br>\nCan anyone give me an actual reason why I'm suspicious?

I never said I was unvoting him permanently, I said quite clearly that it was just to see how it all played out, because he finally had taken my advice and tried defending himself instead of whining. When he then flipped out again on the people who he had just convinced to unvote him, it was a major red flag for me. Please note that HE DID NOT ATTACK ME he was after Bacde...who then turned the tables somehow and shifted the blame on me. It was not a defensive move. It was more of an epiphany that he was scum. I still can not even imagine what it is I actually did to look scummy.

There had been 3 people in my slot before me, and I think another couple of slots had been replaced, so it was hard to catch up and keep track of who was who. I actually ended up scum reading a couple of my predecessors pretty hard. I didn't actually quote any posts and say why they were scummy, but I did comment on how scummy they had been and no wonder that I was at L-2 (or whatever it was).<br>\n<br>\nSo, it's entirely possible that she isn't faking, and she's still scum. However, 2 minutes after she claimed a scum read on herself, she still \"wonders\" if she is scum reading her own slot, which is plenty of time to go look and correct herself.", "time": "Thu Jul 14, 2016 5:56 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=67256&start=1325", "forum": "53", "thread": "67256"}

It's weird behavior. Weirder than just one maf successfully buddying the other. Secondly, I didn't pick up on IAI and Mafioso being buddies, and you'll just have to take my word for it when I say I wouldn't have as scum either unless it was specifically pointed out to me by my mafia partners or something. <br>\n<br>\nAnyway, my point is it's stupid to jump to the conclusion we're mafia together just because we're overly buddy-buddy. Sure, there's wifom, but I have a policy that, as scum, any \"WIFOM\" that puts a thought or connection into people's minds that would not otherwise be there is very, very bad usage of wifom. This is a reasonable policy and you should be perfectly able to see why I would have it and believe me about it.<br>\n<br>\nBesides that, I really do have a history with Sonrio, and we were even in the same newbie game previously.

OK, so it was a bad example because I flipped scum, but it's there and you can see that we weren't mafia together.<br>\n<br>\nI don't know Sonrio's alignment and I doubted myself when he responded (or rather, refused to respond) to the questions about his reads and when he tried to explain his read on tam, but I DID think his entrance was towny at the time and idk how no one else sees that. <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\">", "time": "Thu Jul 14, 2016 6:27 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=67256&start=1325", "forum": "53", "thread": "67256"}

The attack on him seems very direct and very forced somehow.

I have gotten stuck in this trap myself so I agree that he probably just reads formal and maybe a tad awkward, but it could also be nervousness &amp; defensiveness if he is bad. I don't really have a good read on him yet, but I do find it extremely weird that Accountant jumped on him like that and just won't let up.

You seem quite eager.<br>\n<br>\nTown Mafioso- I find your entire demeanor highly suspicious, which, oddly, makes me think that that's just your Style, and an excellent smoke-screen for you when you are mafia...I will have to go back and eyeball a few of your games to see how that plays out, but you are either a character player, or I find you very sus...<br>\n<br>\nAccountant- I have played more than 15 games..not sure exactly how many but you are welcome to look up my posts.</div></blockquote>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8090026#p8090026\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8090026#p8090026\" data-post-id=\"8090026\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 550</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=479\">Tam</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>\"When you say funny do you mean \"haha\" funny, \"weird\" funny or \"suspicious\" funny?

So it appears theres a lot of speculation going on and one of the things that really pings me was the second post in day 2 by iraonvp, basically the nk speculation on who killed who seemed very scummy. Then almost everyone went onto agree with his analysis of that, this makes me think I may need added context to this (going to definitely need to reread day 1). Apparently also my slot is being pressured because...well I am not sure totally on the reason I think someone mentioned a dead player was scumreading my slot.

Apparently my thoughts on what pinged your dialogue in day 2, were misatributed to the fact you were confirmed town day 1, I didn't put this into my consideration at all when processing reads. If you weren't confirmed though, why would you scumreading xk immediately make it so you and him weren't scum? I don't understand the logic there. I don't form reads with basis on who fits with who.

Here's what is bothering me though, about ira being scum.<br>\n<br>\nIf ira is scum, his continued push on you and MC makes no sense. He's one lynch away from being in LyLo, and he's obviously going to be a lynch candidate today. So, why try to push the IC's two biggest confirmed towns, instead of pushing either Sonrio, or myself (we can't both be his remaining scum buddy), when both of us have had suspicions on us in the past. Why go for the hardest possible lynches at such a critical time, insead of going for the easier mislynch, unless he genuinely believes that you guys are scum?<br>\n<br>\nNow, in no way do I believe that you are scum. So, the last two scum must be in ira, Sonrio, MC, and Impoetic. So, if ira is town, then it has to be the case that at least one of MC and Impoetic are scum.", "time": "Mon Jul 25, 2016 3:31 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=67256&start=1850", "forum": "53", "thread": "67256"}
