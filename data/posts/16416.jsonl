Not an uncommon event for the town as this had happened on a rather regular basis since the town was founded back in 1766. What made this night a special night was discovered when thirteen citizens met on the town square at the first rays of light. After hearing muffled sounds throughout the night they decided to seek out the cause for these highly irritating disturbances. <br>And not long after, they realized that every other citizen had been killed during the night.

This is still just a game. Play for fun and stay civil.<br>2. Do not talk about this game outside of this thread.<br>3. Do not quote any PM's from the mod.<br>4. Do not use invisible or small text or other methods to deceive the mod.<br>5. Do not use <span style=\"color: #008000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">this color</span></span> as it is the mod's color.<br>6. Any violations of these rules can and will lead to a warning and/or modkill.<br><br>7. Votes must be formatted in the following fashion: <span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: Player</span>. Unvotes are recommended but not mandatory.<br>8. It will take the majority to lynch, half of the remaining player list to no lynch. If no majority is reached at deadline, the day will end in a no lynch.<br>9. After a majority has been reached you may keep talking until the mod posts the lynch scene.<br>10. Do not post after you die, not even a \"bah\"-post. All rage must be reserved for the dead topic.<br>11. The day phase will last two weeks maximum, the night phase 48 hours.<br><br>12. If a player hasn't posted in 48 hours they will be prodded. If they won't respond to the prod within 24 hours I will be looking for a replacement. Four prods will lead to an automatic replacement.<br>13. V/LA's must be bolded in this thread or sent to the mod via PM.<br><br>14. Since the mod is only human, feel free to request vote counts and prods if you see the need to. Any other questions regarding the setup should be send via PM.<br>15. This ruleset may or not be complete so I reserve the right to change it if I see it fit.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Sample Vanilla Townie Role PM</span><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Welcome to Averagely Suspicious Mafia, xxx.<br><br>You are a <span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: green\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Vanilla Townie</span></span></span>.<br><br>Abilities:<br>None<br><br>You win when all the threats to the town have been eliminated.

After getting the initial \"Alice is a VI, Bob lurks like a champ, Carol goes after lurkers\" and so on out of the way, there's not a whole lot to say until N1. Of course I can't say for sure that happened in this game, but it's happened every time I've been scum.

I feel he's trying to leave his options open here.<br><br>Subgenius is scummy too. I don't think Hiraki claiming to have mis-FoSed Barry rather than Bill is unreasonable, it seems like he's really reaching to call Hiraki scum. His defense of Bill bothers me as well:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>subgenius wrote:</cite>I happen to think this particular meta interpretation makes a certain amount of sense. It was, in fact, to scum's advantage to delay the start of the game, and Erratus admitted that he didn't vote to start the game. I don't think this is damning evidence against Erratus, but it is a bit fishy, and a better reason to cast a vote than is usually seen at this point in the game.</div></blockquote><br>He says that voting me for my delaying tactic is better than RVS, which is a reasonable point.

Since I'm not \"all over the place\" in the thread, and you know it, when I call you on that claim you just say I \"will be\" or \"are in the background\"?  Your explanation makes no sense, and raises my suspicions when it comes to you.

As for wikki - wikki may be new but some of the comments (especially the \"if it will please you\" with the unvote) just looks like a somewhat scummy attempt to please the town.

If you really have this power, I don't think you should do this randomly - there should be some strategy that would allow us to learn something.  <br><br>1. One direction would be to put in names that you are trying to choose between for the \"most likely to be scum\" award.  That way, if one flips either town or scum you may have a better idea about the other (not guaranteed of course, but a better idea nonetheless).   For example, if I were choosing I'd probably put Bill and wikki in together as two of the three, simply because at this point I think I might learn something from one of them flipping either town or maf.  <br><br>2.

In my eyes I see the beginning of someone who is going to go sort of \"hmm, maybe I should vote\" or more use words without putting their actions where it is. Maybe \"all over the place\" isn't quite the right way to describe it but let's say that I can feel in my gut that you will probably act... maybe its hesitant in the future.

Simply put there are always a bunch of small things someone does that add up, and then your threat, oh your threat.<br><br>1. You agreed with the EA wagon but decided it would be better to random vote me. You've already explained this but that doesn't mean that it shouldn't at least be put up there to note. That's the contradiction.<br>2. \"All over the place\" is EA yet not on EA, to Hiraki for his fos and vote, to Zito just because of his comment that EA was town. (and let the record show that if/when I decide to call someone town with little doubt you've threatened to vote me as well) YOU look like you want to keep your options open to me with this one and don't have the guts to call someone town.<br>3. The thing that really changed my mind is that Zito would be voted just because he declared someone town.

When you began today with the wagon on EA you were acting like he had gotten to L-1.<br>2. When you see that you can vote you do and then start wondering about even that, asking for 'wait, is that right?' kind of thing. In my eyes I see the beginning of someone who is going to go sort of \"hmm, maybe I should vote\" or more use words without putting their actions where it is. Maybe \"all over the place\" isn't quite the right way to describe it but let's say that I can feel in my gut that you will probably act... maybe its hesitant in the future. (which, btw, you are right NOW with your 3 suspects and not a single one of them holding your vote.)<br></div></blockquote><br><br>OK, Ashblade, please allow ME to explain this slowly...and please in your future posts don't confuse sarcasm and condescension for actually making a logical argument...<br><br>My first post made an argument regarding voting EA, withholding my vote only because of my miscount - I didn't want to put someone at L-1 that early in the round.  I don't call that \"hesitance\" btw - I call that not placing us in the position of a quickhammer from a scum in case we were wrong. As soon as my count was corrected, I put my vote where my mouth was and voted that same suspicion.  That is not \"all over the place\" - it is in fact consistent, and you know it.  Further, it is not logical to use posts made well after the fact as \"proof\" of your earlier claims.  The truth is you are making claims you cannot back up.  You could have simply said you were wrong - I've certainly done that very thing when it comes to my earlier miscount of the vote.  Instead, you keep changing your terms (from \"all over the place\" to \"hesitance\") and redefining what you consider \"facts\" in order to continue a very poor argument. <br><br>As for my not voting again yet - I will take care of that later today.  Unlike you, my votes are not \"fickle day 1\" as you said to wikki.  I was on the road working yesterday and drove 6 hours to get home - when I get past some home office work today I'll re-read and cast that vote.  I don't consider that a bad thing in a round with a PC set for March - and no, I won't wait for March, just until later today."}

I was never on EA, I just think that those who jumped on him were acting rationally and predictably. I've consistently said that EA's pre-game admission was a bit fishy, but I didn't take it very seriously. Hiraki has been my main pursuit, Zito was an aside that was blown out of proportion since people have decided that it was out of line. I feel like I've been pretty focused on Hiraki. No, I'm not going to call anyone town. I might have my guesses, but that's the as far as it goes. I think it's silly to think any differently.<br>3. Honestly, I haven't played in awhile, and what you're saying about Zito type comments might be true.

Also, I'd still like to know why an explanation wasn't posted with the original FoS.</div></blockquote><br><br>Then in Post 151<br><blockquote><div><cite>subgenius wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Bill McQuill wrote:</cite>No, that's a misinterpretation. A ballsy player from either alignment might post that they did not vote for the quicker day start.<br></div></blockquote><br><br>Cool, then let the record show that I wish to have my earlier apology stricken from the record. I am now back to my original level of finger pointing at Hiraki.</div></blockquote><br><br>...all over the place, and backpedaling, then backpedaling from backpedaling...further, you are using Bill's explanation of his own post (which frankly looks bad for Bill) as evidence on Hiraki (who actually voted Bill).  Either you are reading the thread very poorly and have to go back and restate yourself frequently, or you are going back and forth without good reason.  You state that backpedaling is scummy when applied to Hiraki, but fail to recognize it in yourself.  <br><br>As for your explanation of \"rewriting history\", I still don't see it.  The last comment you quoted from Hiraki appears more LOL/snarky than a rewrite of history.  You are talking about what Hiraki's post implies rather than what it actually says, and at this point I disagree with your conclusion regarding those posts.  At this point, my vote stays."}

Are town people supposed to act like all town people? You're making no sense, assuming with no information, and you're voting him because scumtells from the Wiki apparently are invalid the moment that he posted in here. Does something not make sense here, or is it everything?<br></div></blockquote><br><br>I don't know how many game he has played on the old mafiascum site and you really can't check. plus I didn't think I had to check his game log when I saw he was here since 2008.<br><br>but back to the other question, town can act however he wants but to me he seems like he is trying to earn town points when he makes comments like this<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>For copying Bill's FoS, even after Barry explained his mistake and put his vote where his mouth is.

Acting like you know someone is town is scummy, especially since a hypothetical cop wouldn't have had an investigation yet. If my vote wasn't already on Hiraki, I'd be perfectly willing to vote for Papa Zito.</div></blockquote><br><br>this one in particular because he has said that in his mind declaring someone as town is scummy and a scumtell, so if he truly thought that, that is far worse than anything hiraki had done and should have been reason enough to take his vote off of him.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>subgenius wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Ashblade wrote:</cite>Grey is town, you going to lynch me for saying that?</div></blockquote><br><br>If I thought there was any probability that you're serious, I might.<br><br></div></blockquote><br>again if he thought Ash was serious he said he might lynch him, by his reaction, he thinks Zito was serious, yet no vote for him.  If he is willing to lynch somebody who seriously makes that comment, than the fact that he doesn't was supicious to me, especially because his case on Hiraki isn't very convincing. At least vote Zito and get him to defend himself for that comment, instead he lets Zito fly right by making a \"scum tell\"<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>This seems like putting on blinders to me.

Ending the day would be very premature right now. Town generally benefits from more discussion anyway, so I don't get why you're suggesting a lynch already when day 1 has been going on for less than a week.</div></blockquote><br><br>yeah I agree there are more people who need to participate, but I am not going to not vote to lynch the person I think is scum, because we are waiting to get those people to talk.  and just because a person is at L-2 it doesn't mean that he will be lynched quickly.</div></blockquote><br>You weren't just voting him though. You were actively campaigning him and even suggesting that a lynch might not be a bad idea. Getting sub to L-1 would not have been the end of the world, but given that there's already been one accidental L-1 vote in the game, probably not a great idea either.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>RobCapone wrote:</cite>using Zito's theory about errant, he declared errant town because his wagon grew quickly, I am not a big fan of using speed of a wagon to mean anything, but assume that train of thought is valid, than Sub's wagon was slower to develop and people are trying hard to start sub-wagons or direct attention from him, wouldn't that be a sign that this is most likely a scum wagon?</div></blockquote><br>\"I don't believe x is correct, but assuming it is, wouldn't that imply y?\" sounds like a really intellectually dishonest argument. But let's entertain it anyway.<br><br>First off, I don't believe anyone can consider EA anywhere close to confirmed town. I took PZ's statement to mean that he's probably town, and also that rather than pursuing some pre-game statement that wasn't even a scumtell, we should probably look at the people on the wagon that reached L-1 really fast. Second, your mangled logic can be used to support the wagon on Bill or anyone else as well for that matter - every other wagon could be misdirected from the true scum. <br><br>I'm annoyed that Bill seems to have lurked his way out of suspicion. I still have a strong scum read on him, and him lurking isn't helping.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>subgenius wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>SnakeEyes wrote:</cite>I don't like that you're even entertaining the notion that you're scum. Why would you do that if you were town?</div></blockquote><br><br>Just to point out the WIFOMness of it. There are reasons for both town and scum to want to delay a lynch in my situation, so it's useless to draw conclusions from the fact that I would like to delay my lynch. If I wrote that only a townie would want to delay the lynch, that would be blatantly untrue, and I wouldn't expect anyone to take it seriously.</div></blockquote><br>That's not the point though. Your response indicates an anti-town mindset. A townie would think and say that they shouldn't be lynched because they're town, whereas scum would be more inclined to say that it's a null-tell when they defend themselves. What's more, the way you said it makes it even more suspicious. You're saying that from your point of view, it would be beneficial whether you were town or scum. Which implies that you actually considered it from both alignments, something you should only need to do if you were actually scum."}

However, you also think I'm trying to bring the last votes down on you, and that doing so is terribly scummy. Huh?  If I believe you're scum I should try to convince others.  That's not scummy, again that's WIFOM.  That being said, though, you seriously misinterpret my posts.  Let's talk about the posts you have referenced as concerning to you:<br><br>1. I posted that question to Papa Zito because I did not get why he was voting one way, then throwing in what seemed to be a bit of a random line that he supported a BW on you.

I get why you are looking at this one in a different light, but that was my intent.  I will say once again though, even if your opinion had been right on this post I don't believe it is \"shady\" to try to convince others of your stand on a player.  If that's true, then everyone who has posted an opinion so far must be scum.  <br><br>2. Your post 214 includes a partial quote of me, which you interpret as \"subtle prompting to get the last few votes\" on you.  Let's put that quote in context...\"further, you are using Bill's explanation of his own post (which frankly looks bad for Bill) as evidence on Hiraki (who actually voted Bill).\"  I directed that sentence squarely at you, as evidence that YOU are scummy.  Bill's explanation of his prior post didn't hold water to me, and your attempt to use Bill's bad post as evidence of Hiraki being mafia struck me as scummy.  If mentioning any other player's name is \"subtle prompting\", that's in your imagination, not in my case. <br><br>tldr - I still think Bill looks shady, but at this point I think the case on sub is stronger.  I don't agree with sub's interpretation of my remarks, and my vote stays unless I see something that either convinces me that I'm wrong about sub or shows me that the evidence on someone else is stronger."}

So here we go:<br><br>You voted for me in post #203:<br><blockquote><div><cite>Barry wrote:</cite>subgenius - I am struck by several things in your posts. You kept after Hiraki for a number of posts for his mistaken FoS on me, continuing to press on why there wasn't an explanation posted with the FoS at the time.

You accuse Hiraki of \"rewriting history\", and though I may be missing it, I don't see that point.</div></blockquote><br>I was wrapped up with Hiraki by post #186. You made three posts in between 186 and 203 without any mention of my back and forth with Hiraki. Then, after seeing I have 4 votes on me, you come back with #203, which claims that an exchange which you had already let pass with no remark is the entire basis for your vote, and in the same post you start asking Zito why he isn't voting for me. This does not strike me as a legitimate progression.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Barry wrote:</cite>1.

Your post on Zito was a great scum post, because it's subtle and you have a very clear out. I can't prove your intent, but the fact that you waited so long to cast your vote, combined with the evidence you chose to use, combined with asking Zito about his vote, looks incredibly scummy. Unfortunately, it will probably take my death for people to believe it. <br><blockquote><div><cite>Barry wrote:</cite>2.

You're saying, \"Subgenius, you're scum, and the fact that you're using Bill's quote as part of your case makes Bill look scummier as well.\" This is baiting a response from Bill concerning me with the understanding that if he doesn't come out against me, you'll probably consider it a scummy."}

You don't seem to argue with my vote per se, nor do you seem to argue with the evidence I've used to make my case...you just don't like the timing.  That's an odd defense, and an odd \"case\" you are trying to use on me, but I will tell you the reason for the timing just because it seems to matter so much to you.  I work on the road, and was gone from home for most of the week - logging in on the company laptop when I could (have to be careful how much I use it for these games).  I did log in and posted from time to time to remain active  - but I didn't get the chance to truly sit down and analyze the thread the way I wanted to until I got home.  Up to that point I was trying to choose between Bill and wikki after removing my EA vote.  When I re-read the thread and charted the posts and cases out on my home compy, what pops up on my scumdar but you, sub.  You're right, it was some earlier posts of yours that got my attention when I re-read the thread - but you have done nothing since to take my suspicions off of you.  You have posted poor defenses, given OMGUS arguments, and even now your big problem is NOT my vote, NOT the evidence, but the timing?  Give me a break.  <br><br>As for the partial quote you wish to continue to argue about, my point was NOT to ask Bill to vote you - I think Bill is a potential scum, so why would I ask for HIS vote for you?  I wasn't actually asking for anyone to vote with that post, but rather I was pointing out that it looked shady for you to use Bill's poor defense as a reason to go after Hiraki.  Bill's poor defense in that post should be a reason to go after Bill, not someone else.  <br><br>I expect you to disagree with a case posted against you - I never expect someone to just up and confess.  And, in case you haven't noticed, there <span style=\"font-style: italic\">hasn't</span> been a rush to take you to L-1 or lynch since my vote.  We are still debating things as we should.  If you are truly town, then tell us why the evidence is wrong and why you are town instead of complaining about the timing of my vote or what a jerk I supposedly am for voting you in the first place.   You may be surprised to find out that I would actually listen when you aren't OMGUS'ing."}

I took EA to task early on for his pre-game behavior (in a way that a lot of people found scummy and/or confusing, you being on the latter half of that continuum), I tried to call the game's attention to wikkiden's huge overreaction to \"accidentally\" putting a player at L-1 (in a way that people apparently found scummy for a different set of reasons), and now I'm voting you for reasons I made clear in the longer post and that are now being reinforced.

Whether or not you like it, I really don't care.<br><br>I'm not suggesting that the mafia wouldn't buss their partner, I'm saying it'd be highly illogical on D1 for the mafia to do so. I don't see the point in it, therefore, I asked you the question. Nice assumption. (b\")b<br><br>Also, what does \"someone who is completely cluless...\" mean? Are you saying if someone played the newbie card and didn't talk you'd label them as obv. lurk town?"}

So here's the omnibus version of why Rob is scum, as I see it anyway.<br><br>1)For me, the most telling post is this one:<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2812332#p2812332\" class=\"postlink\">385</a><br><blockquote><div><cite>rob wrote:</cite>my reasons for subs may suck, but they are my own and don't mirror anyone else</div></blockquote><br>A few things here:<br>a)Biggest one is that it shows he was making more effort to not look sheep-like than make sure he had good reasons for voting.<br>b)despite knowing he didn't have good reasons for his accusation he:<br>     i. dismissed the value of more time (<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2804270#p2804270\" class=\"postlink\">211</a>)<br>     ii. I know rob disagrees with me on this, but I think he absolutely was trying to round up further support on my wagon by going out of his way         to question people that he thought would have a good reason to vote for me (zito and Hiraki). I feel more strongly about the interaction with Zito than hiraki. Particularly this quote:(<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2804524#p2804524\" class=\"postlink\">221</a>)<br><blockquote><div><cite>rob wrote:</cite>zito how do you go from supporting a subs wagon to trying to de-rail it when he is L-2, just curious</div></blockquote><br>2)The quickness with which he mounted a defense against the sheeping without even being singled out is pretty conspicuous.(<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2812280#p2812280\" class=\"postlink\">376</a>)<br>3)Insistence that people are scummy when they haven't explained themselves to his satisfaction accompanied by a disregard for when people don't think his cases make sense.<br>4)New one as I write this, that last post of his seems extremely un-town.<br><br><br>I feel extremely strongly about point 1a."}

For someone who is so certain about lurking being a scumtell that it's in your sig, you suddenly seem to be giving a lot of elbow room to some lurkers over others...and it doesn't seem to make sense. For now my vote is on Bill - but I'm also catching up on 3-4 pages of thread and as I re-read it we'll see if it stays there or shifts your way.</div></blockquote><br>I bolded that part because the subs wagon has dwindled to just him and bill, so he needs to get off. yes he has been FOS'ing Bill all along but what seemed funny is right before his vote, Zito voted bill, i didn't think of it much at first but it could be that Zito has earned a town rep and now he felt it was a good enough time to switch his vote (assumption by me of course)<br><br>he also leaves it open that he could vote me just as my wagon is getting bigger.<br><br><br>Well got to go pick up the kids, just some food for thought<br><br>p.edit<br><br>Pen, you were asked why you unvoted me also why are you voting barry without a reason?"}

I didn\u2019t think I would have to address my own massive miscount again, but at the time of my first FoS post I had 7 on the brain (the number required to lynch) and somehow thought 4/7 votes needed instead of 7 total votes needed.  Yes, it was stupid\u2026and I\u2019ve already said that in thread.  But, whether you like it or accept it or not, it\u2019s what happened.  I noted that EA had posted a rather unfortunate message about delaying the game, then posted an OMGUS vote and then claimed he has already posted a case\u2026and when I reviewed the post referred to as the \u201ccase\u201d it didn\u2019t look like a case at all.  When my vote count was corrected, I put my money (or vote) where my mouth was and voted.  That\u2019s not bandwagoning , that\u2019s posting a case.  It\u2019s also not \u201ccautious\u201d \u2013 that vote and post bought me a LOT of attention, unfortunately well deserved attention due to my stupidity, but I don\u2019t call that cautious at all.<br><br>I posted a case on subs after getting back from a trip out of town and doing a rather extensive review of the posts up to that point.  As noted when I voted, that review said to me that subs looked most scummy out of the group, pulling me away from my quandary between Bill and wiki.  When I posted my case (I hope I don\u2019t need to repost the 5,432,653 posts between subs and myself here) it was my case, not a sheep, not a BW.  What took me off Subs was two things as noted in my later post. First was what I considered proof that he was truly a newbie (using the JEEP\u2019s list to scumhunt).  That list explained a lot of his behavior in a different light \u2013 a newbie town light rather than a scum light.  Second was seeing Bill continue to be the only other vote on him\u2026and Bill is someone I\u2019ve posted about several times through this round \u2013 and he continues to have my vote.  <br><br>When I came back home more recently to find a big old Robwagon, I skimmed it while preparing to post my unvote on Subs.  I hadn\u2019t read it fully, so I noted the one post that stuck out on first read (the separation of all those kinds of lurking) and simply noted I was catching up on the thread and would see if I changed my mind afterward.  Let\u2019s talk about that, since Ashblade and Rob see that as overly cautious\u2026<br><br>I don\u2019t view this as cautious \u2013 I always try to keep an open mind to other cases, in case I\u2019m wrong about my own scumhunting.  Only a scum can be truly certain who is scum and town \u2013 and being stubborn about one case to me is a potential scumtell.  I was willing in the end to remove my vote on Subs because I was willing to look at evidence and arguments that made me believe I was wrong about my original case on him. You can call that whatever you want \u2013 but again, only scum are totally certain about who is scum and who is town.<br><br>Since the initial vote and case on me, I\u2019ve seen Rob jump in with a quick support post or three, and Penpen jump in with a vote that is first totally unexplained, then \u201cexplained\u201d with an LOL.  <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>RobCapone wrote:</cite>I read Barry, reading bill now.

He's only explaining his stance, and apologize for what he's done. I've done that as town and scum. While I can't speak for Wikki, I don't see scum in this.

So, um, wouldn't this not apply to the current situation at all, except that Wikki is new? I guess you could call this fruitless crap, but I don't care about it that much to be honest.<br><br>Fifth. Most of his opinions don't take a firm stance on the situation at hand. They just talk about it. ISO 8 is a good example of this.

In fact I would wonder about such a person's affiliation, as the only people who can be absolutely positive about who is maf and who is town would be the mafia itself.  Secondly, I have never sheeped - I have always made my own case and posted said case.  If you don't like my votes, fair enough - but if you have read my posts you know I haven't simply BW'd or sheeped, I've been willing to state the reasons and the case behind my votes.

He's 100% guaranteed to be alive at LyLo unless we lynch him or he gets vigged.   Given his cases so far, he's just going to run in and throw down a random vote... if he's town.  If he's scum, we'll never know, because my comprehension of his posts is subzero - I just cannot understand what he's thinking when he posts.  And Wikki's \"I didn't know how many votes were on the six vote wagon\" defense was bizarre, to say the least."}

Clearly, several people want answers to each of these questions, and Grey has responded by ignoring them, giving incredibly evasive answers, or insults.

If he comes back I will continue to press him - if he is replaced I will have a lot of questions for whoever replaces him.

This boggles my mind a bit - I've seen people put up a poor defense before, but refusing to answer what was initially a very simple question makes no sense - and it brings any reasonable person to the conclusion that there may be more that's hidden here...like affiliation.

It's an annoying wall-of-text, but since you guys have been asking for more content, and pressure on more than one suspect, here you go.)<br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic\">Now</span> can we lynch penpen? I was going to give him a chance to answer a few questions before I made my case, but if he can't even find them....<br><br>I've already been over wikkiden's slip, but here it is again:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>wikkiden wrote:</cite>Oh yes. My vote sucks. Along with the six other people voting for him.</div></blockquote><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>wikkiden wrote:</cite>I know no one will believe me, but I truly didn't count the votes, nor did it occur to me how serious my voting would be.</div></blockquote><br><br>In my eyes, the second quote is clearly a lie, and town would have no reason to lie in that situation. Snake Eyes said that it's not valid because there were actually only 5 other votes. However, if it was just a reactionary post, and wikkiden simply had a general idea that there were several votes, why did he say this?<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>wikkiden wrote:</cite>@the 5 other people thing, excuse me for misspeaking. I wasn't aware that human beings were expected to never make mistakes nowadays. &gt;.&lt;</div></blockquote><br><br>It looks to me like he <span style=\"font-style: italic\">did</span> count the number of votes, just incorrectly.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>penpen wrote:</cite>I've decided to put my vote back on Rob. I don't think he is doing a very good job scum hunting even though he is posting a lot.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote:RobCapone</span></div></blockquote><br><br>This post by penpen is especially bad. I don't think I have to prove to anyone that his scumhunting has been lousy. It does not make any sense for a townie to make this vote when they've done the same thing. Rather, I think it's scum looking for any excuse to place a vote on the biggest wagon.<br><br>The worst part of penpen's play, though, is that he's literally expressed suspicion of, or voted for, 8 different people: RobCapone, Barry Allen, Snake Eyes, subgenius, Hiraki, Bill McQuill, Erratus Apathos, and GreyICE. This looks like someone who is trying to get anyone besides himself killed, rather than someone who is looking for scum.<br><br>So, penpen is still my first choice for a lynch. I'd be happy to lynch Barry as well, though. He's placed mid-to-late votes on several major wagons: Erratus Apathos, subgenius, and GreyICE.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Barry Allen wrote:</cite>There are actually two things that make me worry about my vote for sub.<br><br>1. Finding out that sub is actually playing with a \"list-o-scumtells\" that can actually explain his behavior, even though those scumtells are outdated. GreyICE could be right that using the list isn't a guarantee of affiliation, but it does at least explain a lot about how sub is playing.<br><br>2. Bill's vote - and here's why. Other players already noted Bill fading from the thread for quite a period of time as the heat ramped up on sub. When called out on his absence, Bill comes back with a wall-o-text, and immediately votes the only other player with more votes than himself, taking said player (sub) to L-1. This could be a townie trying to appeal to the town with action after being called for inactivity - or it could be maf trying to move us to a quicker lynch in order to keep the heat off himself. @ Bill - if that sounds \"negative\", sorry but I don't know how to put this more positively...no, wait, how about this...I am \"positive\" that this looks a bit scummy. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif\" alt=\":roll:\" title=\"Rolling Eyes\"><br><br>Sub - your own posts haven't helped you. You've mostly lashed out at me and a couple of other folks, with some strained logic and implied motivations - but again if you are using JEEP's list for scumtells it is possible that you are inexperienced enough that this is just how you post (you've been on the site for a long time but IIRC haven't played much lately - someone please correct me if I'm wrong on this). But, with EA taking his vote off you we are back to L-2, meaning we do have time to talk more. Bill's vote isn't enough to take my own vote off you, but it is enough that I want to hear more before we do a quickhammer here.</div></blockquote><br><br>As I've mentioned, I don't like this post because it stays with the vote on subgenius, but sets up Bill to be the next lynch when Sub presumably flips town. He eventually changed his vote, but not until <span style=\"font-style: italic\">after</span> the Sub wagon fell apart:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Barry Allen wrote:</cite>A lot has happened since I was last on thread...let me do this first, as I already promised to do some serious thinking about my sub case...<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: UNVOTE</span><br><br>Subs - you didn't convince me with the \"No YOU are\" posts...but again two things nagged at me. First was knowing you were using that old guide, which really explained your posts and made it plausible that you were playing with less actual playing experience than would seem likely given when you joined the site. The second is now even more apparent to me...the only other vote for you is from Bill, and I've been looking very dimly at Bill for some time (first trying to choose between Bill and wikki, and later Bill and you).</div></blockquote><br><br>Note that he doesn't have any new reasons for disliking his vote...the only thing that has changed is the size of the wagon. Once again, it really looks like Barry is just trying to help encourage wagons and keep himself alive.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: penpen</span>"}

He has a knack for finding himself snuggly in the middle of the biggest wagons. It's been mentioned many times, Barry plays very cautiously. I can't really decide if this is scummy or not. Add this to his strange counter-wagon defense, his refusal to outright say that he was accusing anyone of being scum by calling it a counter-wagon, yet claiming credit for scum hunting by labeling it a counter-wagon and a sense that he goes out of his way to avoid possible scum tells, and I'm quite suspicious of Barry. <br><br>As far as penpen goes... I just don't know. I'm leaning towards VI, but that hammer from yesterday was reckless. I'm not second guessing the GreyICE lynch, but I'm not sure penpen even realized he was casting the killing vote. Also, the fact that he's blaming his vote on Zito is troubling. He's looking very easily manipulated, which will become more and more of a liability as the town:scum ratio becomes worse. So, my opinion is that he's dangerous to town, but I'm not convinced he's scum. I don't know what to do about it, but I need to see more before I think lynching is the answer.<br><br>I'm starting to feel a bit better about Rob's town cred, although I think his insistence on keeping his vote on Hiraki is retarded as hell.<br><br>My only other thoughts are that I really want to hear more from Bill and mozamis today, because I have very little read on either one of them, and I need to do a re-read with a more critical eye towards EA and Papa Zito.

The whole issue with Zito neglecting to even entertain the possibility that SE was a vig kill makes more sense as town than scum. It could be a purposeful trick, but it would be fairly subtle and rely on us eventually reading the flavor correctly and then coming back to notice his tell.

As for penpen, I've already stated several times that he is either VI or Scum and I'm still trying to sort out which it is.<br><br><br>Now, let's get to the rest of subs post, which seems to bring to a head a trend I've noted in subs' posts against me...that of trying out a point, then redefining terms or twisting reality in order to make a wrong point \"fit\" his case...some examples here...<br><blockquote><div><cite>subgenius wrote:</cite>You could have voted in your first D2 post, you know, before your V/LA.</div></blockquote> Now that you have to recognize that my V/LA makes your point less valid about why I voted \"late\" in the tally, you now want to redefine the terms of your complaint as state that I should have simply posted an immediate vote D2.  <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>subgenius wrote:</cite>Clearly, you didn't want to do it (OMGUS) because you thought it would look scummy, not because you feel it's unhelpful to town.</div></blockquote>This is another example of you redefining things...you call me out for not OMGUS'ing, I point out I've been consistent in my stand whether you like it or not, so you simply redefine things to imply a motivation for which you have no evidence...because you are making it up.  To reiterate,  I think OMGUS voting does not help the town, I thought it was bad enough that it was actually a part of my case on EA, and I still refuse to OMGUS vote.  If you think that you should vote for me because I don't like OMGUS voting, that's your right...but don't try to twist this into something else while you're at it.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>subgenius wrote:</cite> I think your refusal to engage your accusers out of fear of OMGUS is scummy.</div></blockquote>What part of my posts this round looks like I'm \"refusing to engage my accusers\"?  There are a lot of things you can say about me, but \"refusing to engage my accusers\" doesn't seem to fit here....and once again you are trying to redefine things when you are failing to make a point.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>subgenius wrote:</cite>1. I did give an example of your pandering:<br><blockquote><div><cite>Barry wrote:</cite>This and Rob\u2019s later post are awfully convenient. If we are looking for a counterwagon, I believe we\u2019ve found it. <span class=\"noboldsig\">If you wish to follow it, remember who took you there.</span></div></blockquote></div></blockquote>THIS is your idea of \"pandering\"?  Really?  My simply stating that if someone BW'd me out of the round that you should remember who did it?  Wait, I thought I was \"afraid to engage my accusers\", but HERE I'm \"pandering\" when telling the town to remember them when I flip town.  You are not making a simple, straightforward case, but rather a series of unconnected and even contradictory arguments.<br><blockquote><div><cite>subgenius wrote:</cite>If you want to say it wasn't OMGUS, because you didn't vote, fine. We can make up a new name for accusing your wagoners without voting.</div></blockquote>I'm sure you CAN make up a new name - you've been redefining things all through your case.<br><blockquote><div><cite>subgenius wrote:</cite>3. It's easy to make a case and hop aboard. Just writing up a case doesn't mean you aren't sheeping.</div></blockquote>Once again redefining terms.  Before you accused me of NOT making cases...now you have to admit I AM making cases, but you still want to call it the same thing you did before so now it's \"making cases-style sheeping\".<br><br>Sub - you still could be an overzealous townie who can't see past the flaws in your own points.  What you definitely are doing is making points that don't hold up, then you are either redefining the terms, implying motivations to my statements that aren't there, or are making contradictory points in an attempt to shore up the original flawed argument.  <br><br>1. I have consistently made a case with each vote, either in the post of the vote or before.  You may not like my cases - in fact you may completely disagree with them.  But that doesn't take away from the fact that I AM making cases when I vote.<br>2. I have a consistent dislike for OMGUS, using it as part of a case, and refusing to OMGUS vote even under high pressure from you to OMGUS.  If you disagree that OMGUS'ing is bad, that's your opinion.  What I cannot understand is how you can equate refusing to OMGUS with scum.  That's your point to make - but I don't believe it is a point that holds up to scrutiny.<br>3. If you want to hold me up to scrutiny, fair enough.  If you want to vote me, that is your right in this game.  If you want to keep redefining reality to make a point, I reserve the right to call you on it.  Again, at this point I think you could be an overzealous townie - what I know you are is wrong when it comes to your accusations."}

He's only explaining his stance, and apologize for what he's done. I've done that as town and scum. While I can't speak for Wikki, I don't see scum in this.

I don't know why. For pressure? Does he really think Pod is scum at this point, or is he hoping to shake loose a scum-tell? I don't know, but I do know he isn't doing much shaking. Lets not forget that he's admitted that his case on Bill sucked, so his reason for voting Pod must be something that happened since he replaced in. I also refuse to believe that he genuinely believes that Bill replaced himself. That's one of the most retarded theories that has appeared in this thread. It seems far more likely that he's only claiming to believe in this idiocy because I wrote that I think Pod would deserve to be lynched immediately if the theory was true. Here's something else I think; Anyone who claims to believe that Bill replaced himself is either crazy or lying.

You rummage through his backpack and you turn up binoculars and night goggles among other things. Oh god, another person with the potential to help you find the killers dead. But wait! You notice a bulge in one of the side pockets of the backpack. You zip it open....a pile of cards, every one of them labeled with the words \"You're next!\" on it...and a gun! mozamis must've been one of the people behind the killings then!<br><br><br>mozamis, </span></span></span></span><span style=\"color: red\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"font-style: italic\">Mafia Watcher</span></span></span></span><span style=\"color: #008000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"font-style: italic\">, killed Night 2<br><br><br>One of you looks out of the window and is once again met by the sight of the silver lining.

I'm amazed and honored to have made it this far.<br><br>I have actually helped the town at more than one point in time, though obviously my goal has been to make it through to a win for myself, as any player in this position should do.  Here's my hits:<br><br>1. Night one - Hitting Snake Eyes was a truly randomized hit.  Sorry SE.<br>2. Night two - I'm proud of this one.  I purposely went for a mafioso and hit Mozamis.  Looking back at the thread for D2, Mozamis looked the most scummy, and I did not want to see a clean sweep for the maf so I sent in the hit request and crossed my fingers.  <br>3. Day three - again, I wanted to bring this down to one maf left - and I didn't want to be lynched myself.  I was at L-2 at one point, remember.  Still, I suspected strongly that the town was right about AGar and when I saw the vote at L-1 I hammered.  Again, very proud to have hit that mafioso, bringing it down to one last bad guy for me to compete against (at least I hope it's just one).<br>4. Night three - I didn't want this to be just townies and me so I did purposely hit Subs for two reasons...First, to bring us to where we are today, and second...because I didn't suspect him of being maf. Not a nice thing, I realize, but at least I'm telling you exactly what happened.<br><br>As for my suspicions - I didn't have Zito high on my list, so if he turns up maf I'll feel really stupid.  I do think his \"clearing\" of EA makes much more sense in light of the mason flip for EA.  That leaves Pods and bvoigt.<br><br>Now, Pods - I have had fun going back and forth with you in this round.  I don't know for sure your affiliation (though your last post makes me lean town read on you more than I ever have) - but going back and forth with you seemed to give me something to appear active about while keeping myself alive.<br><br>That would leave us with bvoigt as our likely mafioso...so let me clear my throat and do something that is just as unusual as claiming my role...I will ask the town to support the Serial Killer over the mafia.<br><br>If I am lynched today, you guarantee a mafioso victory.  The maf will hit one of the remaining townies, there will be a tie tomorrow, and the maf wins the next night.  Guaranteed.  If you lynch a townie, I am much better off hitting a townie and taking the draw or \"no result\" or whatever it would be with the mafia - so I would not be inclined to hit a suspected mafioso.  I would venture a guess that the last remaining maf would feel the same way - since our hitting each other would automatically mean we both lose. This means that my original statement is correct - right now there is no way for a town win to happen, though you are in the position to decide who does win.<br><br>I may be the SK - but I have killed two mafioso (one by night hit and one by day hammer) and hope you remember that kindly as you decide how to vote.  I'm asking you to lynch the last mafioso.  If that last maf isn't you, Pods, then it is likely bvoigt...and I will:<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: bvoigt</span><br><br>bvoigt - if you are maf please post your case as to why you should be allowed to win.  If you are not, then let's put the pressure on Pods to give his own case."}

It's up to the GM if he wants to play this out to the end at that point, which would go as follows:<br>                     1. You lynch me and go to tonight with 2 town and one maf<br>                     2. Maf hits one of you tonight<br>                     3.

Maf hits last townie next night and wins<br><br>Same goes for my win if you lynch the maf.<br><br>The only other choices are to lynch a townie or to go no lynch.  The only confusion with a no lynch would be if both the maf and I hit the same townie.  In that case we go to 1 maf, 1 SK and 1 town into tomorrow - and again the last townie is the kingmaker.<br><br>In other words, Papa Zito, there truly is no way for you to win.  The only way for you to win is for Pods and I to be stupid enough to hit each other.  Otherwise, if one of us hits town and the other is hit by the other, then you go to the next day with 1 maf (or 1 sk) and 1 town...again it plays out to a town loss.<br><br>I don't know how to put this more clearly - the town has no chance.  I'll take a tie if I have to...even if that risks a maf victory by getting hit tonight.<br><br>So...Papa Zito, good luck - if you're still alive tomorrow you will be in the same place you are today, only with more time on your hands before the resolution.  Please reconsider your vote.  Thanks!"}

The reason I changed my mind was a PM from the GM that confirmed if we went through 3 day/night cycles of no-lynch, no-hit we would have a 3-way tie.  After I heard that, I changed my request to hit Zito.  Wish now I had left that alone, as I was certain Pods will no-kill again and we would have put bvoigt in the position voting or accepting the result we eventually got here.

Of course, this would require one of the scum to vote for one of the townies, and it's quite possible they would both refuse. With that in mind, I think you and Zito did it right, and were heading towards a good chance of cross-kills until Pod Person suggested no kill. That really was a great move on his part. <br><br>Also, hats off to Barry for maintaining a flow of walls of false suspicion towards Bill/Pod for the entire game. I thought it was a screening tactic, and I was right, but I'm quite certain that if it were me, I would have lost my focus at some point and started stirring up trouble where it wasn't needed and drawn attention to myself. You played a good game, and your walls of semantic defenses were too annoying to untangle, so I gave up on continuing to pressure you. Well played."}

Props to all of you!<br>- Barry Allen: SK is always a tough role to pull of and he went through the game almost unsuspected for the whole time.<br>- Town play past D2: There was a pretty solid town core (EA, PZ, subgenius) and a pretty solid suspect core (mozamis, AGar, pod), so the townies made themselves very obvious.<br>- Mason staying hidden for so long. They're a powerful role, especially when it comes to LyLo.<br><br>What didn't go well:<br>- Town play until N2: I believe GreyICE would've been a great asset for the town, but unfortunately he became victim of the random D1 lynch. And it becomes quite apparent again how hard it is to deal with VIs/inexperienced players. Nonetheless I think wikkiden should've gotten a lot more pressure for that glaring contradiction on D1. Very confusing town on the first two days.<br>- Mason play: Sorry, guys. But you had the scum team already pegged N1. And Hiraki was in your town reads. And you completely let the Hiraki lynch go through on D2 (although Hiraki didn't help his case by doing nothing). You failed to form a vote block that could've pressured the scum more.<br>- The mafia kill N1: There was a claimed tracker with three scum roles to catch and Papa Zito who had all of you pegged D1 and you go after a moderately townish person? If you can get rid of a town PR N1 you do it, no matter how shady that person looks. Claimed PRs don't get lynched on early days without a cc. Wasted kill.<br>- End game: Not your fault, but it's not the satisfactory ending I was hoping for.<br><br><br>Regarding the setup:<br>I don't think the Mafia was overpowered at all if you take into account some things:<br>- A tracker who claims unprovoked Day 1 is a huge blow for town. He could've tracked all three scum so it'd be in the best interest to stay hidden as long as possible.<br>- The mafia watcher was basically useless with only one role to catch.<br>- The mafia doc may be a bit more useful than a town doc, but he is very dangerous for his team if he flips after he has claimed.<br><br>I probably would tweak it if I would run it again, but not by much (get rid of the goon/limit the SK in some way).<br><br>In the end, the town maybe deserved the win since two mislynches is borderline in a mini and they played overall well for the second part of the game. But as I said in the Dead QT, they got punished for their bad first two days and just weren't lucky enough with cross kills.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Ashblade wrote:</cite>Oh, Barry killed me. LOL, no wonder I died.</div></blockquote><br>Sorry, I mixed up Barry and Bill. You were in fact the mafia kill and I fixed it in the other post.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>bvoigt wrote:</cite>BTW, what would have been the best way to play in the 1:1:2 endgame?</div></blockquote><br>Well, when pod proposed to lynch PZ, the confirmed town, I wish PZ wouldn't have dismissed it right away. Whoever PZ suspected at that moment, it was obivous that the two remaining scum didn't who each other were. Which would've increased the likelihood of an unintentional cross kill and a subsequent town win by a lot. Of course, there's a lot of inside knowledge mod talk in here, but this seemed to be the best way for town to still have a shot at winning.<br><br>I hope you still enjoyed the game as much as I did.<br><br>Fun fact: Scum hammered all three times.

In 3:9's for instance, the town win rate was floundering at around 36% - doesn't it seem strange to you in a game with one more scum, the town is producing better results? (Note: I'm using 12 player games here because the sample size for 13 isn't large enough)<br><br>The reason is crosskills. In games with additional kills at night, whether they be from a vig or SK, they are producing a higher ratio of non-mafia kills to mafia kills, diluting their influence - mafia no longer get to decide 50% of the kills in the game. This weakened influence with their own NK, coupled with the risk of being picked off at night severely bites into mafia's chances of winning. It's an admittedly swingy mechanism to balance a game, as a small to large piece of the game is out of town's hands, but this is the baggage you need to accept when playing in a multiple scum game. Personally, I prefer not playing in games with two mafia factions or a mafia/SK, for this very reason. It makes the game increasingly chaotic and dependent on what happens with the kills, which isn't fun for me. However, many players and mods like the SK role, so we're going to have to convince them otherwise here.  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\"> <br><br>To speak from a more anecdotal perspective, many 3:1:8's in the past have had similar balances of power; a Bulletproof SK, or maybe a mafia GF with investigation or NK immunity, against 2-3 town powers. I think it's easy to be deceived into thinking the mafia was overpowered this game, because they have two PR's. But lets look at what they actually do; the Doctor - he offers protection to one mafia member out of three. This is only useful against the SK, and unlike being a NK-immune GF, the scumteam can lose this power by the Doc being NK'ed (or lynched). The Watcher for mafia does very little this game - it can only catch one town PR, and the SK is immune to it. The reason for masons existing in the game, is so town have a small core of power that isn't able to be manipulated by scum's powers. <br><br>I think it's also important to remember, with 3:1:8's producing relatively even contests (despite being swingy), we're now adding in an extra townie, which should be another town benefit. I think it's easy to look at the set-up and scan the roles, and go, <span style=\"font-style: italic\">\"hang on, 3 town PR's against 4 scum? That isn't right!\"</span> But crosskills are a particularly fickle mechanic that rip through the heart of a scum team as easily as it can obliterate town, and it's kind of sucky that this mechanic is what plays a big part in determining the outcome of Mafia/SK games - it's probably that feeling that you don't have much control over the outcome as a townie that makes it appear unbalanced. But that is the nature of the beast!"}

Because by nature, the very inclusion of two killing forces at night is going to produce a swingy game, where crosskills are crucial.</div></blockquote><br><br>Sorry, 3:1:9 versus 3:10s.  I guess the point differs (used to MTGS a bit much) but 3:1:9s still are nearly certainly losses with two mislynches and minimal crosskills.  <br><br>Town power can definitely be added to counteract that.  Examples:<br><br>PGO<br>Bulletproof (or 1-shot BP)<br>Doctor<br>Jailkeeper (bites both ways into NKs)<br><br>All can cut down on NKs, or swing it back towards town.  The first three LET townies paint giant targets on their head.  Go doctor hunting, and you might hit the SK or scum with their heads down just blending in.  Throw in a Nurse, and the town isn't even that bad off.<br><br>Were I to do a 3:1:9, I might do:<br><br>1 Doctor<br>1 Nurse<br>1 1-shot BP<br>1 JoAT (Track, Watch, Vig)<br><br>As the town power."}
