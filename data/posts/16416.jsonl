Not an uncommon event for the town as this had happened on a rather regular basis since the town was founded back in 1766. What made this night a special night was discovered when thirteen citizens met on the town square at the first rays of light. After hearing muffled sounds throughout the night they decided to seek out the cause for these highly irritating disturbances. <br>\nAnd not long after, they realized that every other citizen had been killed during the night. A note was lying next to each victim, leaving the remaining townsmen quite rattled:<br>\n<br>\n\"You're next...\"<br>\n<br>\nTime to start-a-killin', folks!</div></div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Player List:<br>\n9. pod person <div style=\"font-size: 80%; line-height: normal; display: inline\"><div style=\"display:inline-flex;text-decoration:line-through\">Bill McQuill</div></div><br>\n10.

This is still just a game. Play for fun and stay civil.<br>\n2. Do not talk about this game outside of this thread.<br>\n3. Do not quote any PM's from the mod.<br>\n4. Do not use invisible or small text or other methods to deceive the mod.<br>\n5. Do not use <div style=\"display:inline;color:#008000\">this color</div> as it is the mod's color.<br>\n6. Any violations of these rules can and will lead to a warning and/or modkill.<br>\n<br>\n7. Votes must be formatted in the following fashion: <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: Player</div>. Unvotes are recommended but not mandatory.<br>\n8. It will take the majority to lynch, half of the remaining player list to no lynch. If no majority is reached at deadline, the day will end in a no lynch.<br>\n9. After a majority has been reached you may keep talking until the mod posts the lynch scene.<br>\n10. Do not post after you die, not even a \"bah\"-post. All rage must be reserved for the dead topic.<br>\n11. The day phase will last two weeks maximum, the night phase 48 hours.<br>\n<br>\n12. If a player hasn't posted in 48 hours they will be prodded. If they won't respond to the prod within 24 hours I will be looking for a replacement. Four prods will lead to an automatic replacement.<br>\n13. V/LA's must be bolded in this thread or sent to the mod via PM.<br>\n<br>\n14. Since the mod is only human, feel free to request vote counts and prods if you see the need to. Any other questions regarding the setup should be send via PM.<br>\n15. This ruleset may or not be complete so I reserve the right to change it if I see it fit.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Sample Vanilla Townie Role PM</div>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>\nWelcome to Averagely Suspicious Mafia, xxx.<br>\n<br>\nYou are a <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:green\">Vanilla Townie</div></div>.<br>\n<br>\nAbilities:<br>\nNone<br>\n<br>\nYou win when all the threats to the town have been eliminated.

I do think wikki is appealing to emotion, especially with his unvote \"if it will make you happy\".  However, that post from wikki came after Bill jumped on wikki.  Something just isn't right here...I'm torn between voting Bill and voting wikki right now.<br>\n<br>\n2. @GreyICE...could you please explain that post in which you voted sub?  Zito declares someone \"town\", and that looks bad to me - I'm not ready to declare that any other player is town, and don't know why Zito would do so.  Sub has been all over the place, but calling out Zito for that remark doesn't look like a scumtell to me, so please let us know more about your thoughts here.<br>\n<br>\n3. @Ashblade - I would like more about how I'm \"all over the place\".

I'm aggressive where I come from, and I know I'm not displaying that much here.

He has had nothing to say to help stir up discussion, nor has he said anything beneficial to the town. All he is doing is throwing out a few sentences on the many people who he has found to be acting scummy. He's going after the smallest scum-tells he can find.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nI also think that Sub jumping on Zito just for stating his opinion is, if anything, simply meant to stir up conflict.

As for wikki - wikki may be new but some of the comments (especially the \"if it will please you\" with the unvote) just looks like a somewhat scummy attempt to please the town.  Given that, I wasn't ready to choose between the two.  <br>\n<br>\nI am glad I've waited - Ashblade's reply to me looks rather bizarre and may send me in his direction with a vote instead of Bill or wikki, but I'd like to re-read and hopefully come back later tonight before giving it up for the evening.

If you really have this power, I don't think you should do this randomly - there should be some strategy that would allow us to learn something.  <br>\n<br>\n1. One direction would be to put in names that you are trying to choose between for the \"most likely to be scum\" award.  That way, if one flips either town or scum you may have a better idea about the other (not guaranteed of course, but a better idea nonetheless).   For example, if I were choosing I'd probably put Bill and wikki in together as two of the three, simply because at this point I think I might learn something from one of them flipping either town or maf.  <br>\n<br>\n2. You could choose another direction and simply pick three of the least actives...my usual worry D1 is that the real scum play lurky-loo while everyone else posts a lot and picks on each other all the way to a ML.  <br>\n<br>\nI'm sure there are other strategies to the selection process, but that's the first two that popped into my mind.

You were actively campaigning him and even suggesting that a lynch might not be a bad idea.

But let's entertain it anyway.<br>\n<br>\nFirst off, I don't believe anyone can consider EA anywhere close to confirmed town. I took PZ's statement to mean that he's probably town, and also that rather than pursuing some pre-game statement that wasn't even a scumtell, we should probably look at the people on the wagon that reached L-1 really fast. Second, your mangled logic can be used to support the wagon on Bill or anyone else as well for that matter - every other wagon could be misdirected from the true scum. <br>\n<br>\nI'm annoyed that Bill seems to have lurked his way out of suspicion.

There are reasons for both town and scum to want to delay a lynch in my situation, so it's useless to draw conclusions from the fact that I would like to delay my lynch. If I wrote that only a townie would want to delay the lynch, that would be blatantly untrue, and I wouldn't expect anyone to take it seriously.</div></blockquote>\nThat's not the point though. Your response indicates an anti-town mindset. A townie would think and say that they shouldn't be lynched because they're town, whereas scum would be more inclined to say that it's a null-tell when they defend themselves. What's more, the way you said it makes it even more suspicious. You're saying that from your point of view, it would be beneficial whether you were town or scum.

So here we go:<br>\n<br>\nYou voted for me in post #203:\n<blockquote><div><cite>Barry wrote:</cite>subgenius - I am struck by several things in your posts. You kept after Hiraki for a number of posts for his mistaken FoS on me, continuing to press on why there wasn't an explanation posted with the FoS at the time.

You accuse Hiraki of \"rewriting history\", and though I may be missing it, I don't see that point.</div></blockquote>\nI was wrapped up with Hiraki by post #186. You made three posts in between 186 and 203 without any mention of my back and forth with Hiraki. Then, after seeing I have 4 votes on me, you come back with #203, which claims that an exchange which you had already let pass with no remark is the entire basis for your vote, and in the same post you start asking Zito why he isn't voting for me.

Your post on Zito was a great scum post, because it's subtle and you have a very clear out. I can't prove your intent, but the fact that you waited so long to cast your vote, combined with the evidence you chose to use, combined with asking Zito about his vote, looks incredibly scummy.

That's an odd defense, and an odd \"case\" you are trying to use on me, but I will tell you the reason for the timing just because it seems to matter so much to you.  I work on the road, and was gone from home for most of the week - logging in on the company laptop when I could (have to be careful how much I use it for these games).  I did log in and posted from time to time to remain active  - but I didn't get the chance to truly sit down and analyze the thread the way I wanted to until I got home.  Up to that point I was trying to choose between Bill and wikki after removing my EA vote.  When I re-read the thread and charted the posts and cases out on my home compy, what pops up on my scumdar but you, sub.  You're right, it was some earlier posts of yours that got my attention when I re-read the thread - but you have done nothing since to take my suspicions off of you.  You have posted poor defenses, given OMGUS arguments, and even now your big problem is NOT my vote, NOT the evidence, but the timing?

I wasn't actually asking for anyone to vote with that post, but rather I was pointing out that it looked shady for you to use Bill's poor defense as a reason to go after Hiraki.  Bill's poor defense in that post should be a reason to go after Bill, not someone else.  <br>\n<br>\nI expect you to disagree with a case posted against you - I never expect someone to just up and confess.

{"number": 540, "id": "2815018", "user": "Barry Allen", "user_id": "14906", "content": "Well Zito, it looks like we finally have a counterwagon &#8211; but instead it&#8217;s a counterwagon to Rob&#8230;let&#8217;s look&#8230;first of all my presence on the first two BWs&#8230;<br>\n<br>\nFirst, I didn&#8217;t BW or sheep, I did post a case on EA.  I didn&#8217;t think I would have to address my own massive miscount again, but at the time of my first FoS post I had 7 on the brain (the number required to lynch) and somehow thought 4/7 votes needed instead of 7 total votes needed.  Yes, it was stupid&#8230;and I&#8217;ve already said that in thread.  But, whether you like it or accept it or not, it&#8217;s what happened.  I noted that EA had posted a rather unfortunate message about delaying the game, then posted an OMGUS vote and then claimed he has already posted a case&#8230;and when I reviewed the post referred to as the &#8220;case&#8221; it didn&#8217;t look like a case at all.  When my vote count was corrected, I put my money (or vote) where my mouth was and voted.  That&#8217;s not bandwagoning , that&#8217;s posting a case.  It&#8217;s also not &#8220;cautious&#8221; &#8211; that vote and post bought me a LOT of attention, unfortunately well deserved attention due to my stupidity, but I don&#8217;t call that cautious at all.<br>\n<br>\nI posted a case on subs after getting back from a trip out of town and doing a rather extensive review of the posts up to that point.  As noted when I voted, that review said to me that subs looked most scummy out of the group, pulling me away from my quandary between Bill and wiki.  When I posted my case (I hope I don&#8217;t need to repost the 5,432,653 posts between subs and myself here) it was my case, not a sheep, not a BW.  What took me off Subs was two things as noted in my later post. First was what I considered proof that he was truly a newbie (using the JEEP&#8217;s list to scumhunt).  That list explained a lot of his behavior in a different light &#8211; a newbie town light rather than a scum light.  Second was seeing Bill continue to be the only other vote on him&#8230;and Bill is someone I&#8217;ve posted about several times through this round &#8211; and he continues to have my vote.  <br>\n<br>\nWhen I came back home more recently to find a big old Robwagon, I skimmed it while preparing to post my unvote on Subs.  I hadn&#8217;t read it fully, so I noted the one post that stuck out on first read (the separation of all those kinds of lurking) and simply noted I was catching up on the thread and would see if I changed my mind afterward.  Let&#8217;s talk about that, since Ashblade and Rob see that as overly cautious&#8230;<br>\n<br>\nI don&#8217;t view this as cautious &#8211; I always try to keep an open mind to other cases, in case I&#8217;m wrong about my own scumhunting.  Only a scum can be truly certain who is scum and town &#8211; and being stubborn about one case to me is a potential scumtell.  I was willing in the end to remove my vote on Subs because I was willing to look at evidence and arguments that made me believe I was wrong about my original case on him. You can call that whatever you want &#8211; but again, only scum are totally certain about who is scum and who is town.<br>\n<br>\nSince the initial vote and case on me, I&#8217;ve seen Rob jump in with a quick support post or three, and Penpen jump in with a vote that is first totally unexplained, then &#8220;explained&#8221; with an LOL.  <br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>RobCapone wrote:</cite>I read Barry, reading bill now.

I am not OMGUS voting - I made part of my case on EA due to OMGUS voting - WHY would I turn around and OMGUS vote here?

It's an annoying wall-of-text, but since you guys have been asking for more content, and pressure on more than one suspect, here you go.)<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Now</div> can we lynch penpen? I was going to give him a chance to answer a few questions before I made my case, but if he can't even find them....<br>\n<br>\nI've already been over wikkiden's slip, but here it is again:<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>wikkiden wrote:</cite>Oh yes. My vote sucks. Along with the six other people voting for him.</div></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>wikkiden wrote:</cite>I know no one will believe me, but I truly didn't count the votes, nor did it occur to me how serious my voting would be.</div></blockquote>\n\nIn my eyes, the second quote is clearly a lie, and town would have no reason to lie in that situation. Snake Eyes said that it's not valid because there were actually only 5 other votes. However, if it was just a reactionary post, and wikkiden simply had a general idea that there were several votes, why did he say this?<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>wikkiden wrote:</cite>@the 5 other people thing, excuse me for misspeaking. I wasn't aware that human beings were expected to never make mistakes nowadays. &gt;.&lt;</div></blockquote>\n\nIt looks to me like he <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">did</div> count the number of votes, just incorrectly.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>penpen wrote:</cite>I've decided to put my vote back on Rob. I don't think he is doing a very good job scum hunting even though he is posting a lot.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote:RobCapone</div></div></blockquote>\n\nThis post by penpen is especially bad. I don't think I have to prove to anyone that his scumhunting has been lousy. It does not make any sense for a townie to make this vote when they've done the same thing. Rather, I think it's scum looking for any excuse to place a vote on the biggest wagon.<br>\n<br>\nThe worst part of penpen's play, though, is that he's literally expressed suspicion of, or voted for, 8 different people: RobCapone, Barry Allen, Snake Eyes, subgenius, Hiraki, Bill McQuill, Erratus Apathos, and GreyICE. This looks like someone who is trying to get anyone besides himself killed, rather than someone who is looking for scum.<br>\n<br>\nSo, penpen is still my first choice for a lynch. I'd be happy to lynch Barry as well, though. He's placed mid-to-late votes on several major wagons: Erratus Apathos, subgenius, and GreyICE.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Barry Allen wrote:</cite>There are actually two things that make me worry about my vote for sub.<br>\n<br>\n1. Finding out that sub is actually playing with a \"list-o-scumtells\" that can actually explain his behavior, even though those scumtells are outdated. GreyICE could be right that using the list isn't a guarantee of affiliation, but it does at least explain a lot about how sub is playing.<br>\n<br>\n2. Bill's vote - and here's why. Other players already noted Bill fading from the thread for quite a period of time as the heat ramped up on sub. When called out on his absence, Bill comes back with a wall-o-text, and immediately votes the only other player with more votes than himself, taking said player (sub) to L-1. This could be a townie trying to appeal to the town with action after being called for inactivity - or it could be maf trying to move us to a quicker lynch in order to keep the heat off himself. @ Bill - if that sounds \"negative\", sorry but I don't know how to put this more positively...no, wait, how about this...I am \"positive\" that this looks a bit scummy. <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":roll:\" title=\"Rolling Eyes\"><br>\n<br>\nSub - your own posts haven't helped you. You've mostly lashed out at me and a couple of other folks, with some strained logic and implied motivations - but again if you are using JEEP's list for scumtells it is possible that you are inexperienced enough that this is just how you post (you've been on the site for a long time but IIRC haven't played much lately - someone please correct me if I'm wrong on this). But, with EA taking his vote off you we are back to L-2, meaning we do have time to talk more. Bill's vote isn't enough to take my own vote off you, but it is enough that I want to hear more before we do a quickhammer here.</div></blockquote>\n\nAs I've mentioned, I don't like this post because it stays with the vote on subgenius, but sets up Bill to be the next lynch when Sub presumably flips town. He eventually changed his vote, but not until <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">after</div> the Sub wagon fell apart:<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Barry Allen wrote:</cite>A lot has happened since I was last on thread...let me do this first, as I already promised to do some serious thinking about my sub case...<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: UNVOTE</span><br>\n<br>\nSubs - you didn't convince me with the \"No YOU are\" posts...but again two things nagged at me. First was knowing you were using that old guide, which really explained your posts and made it plausible that you were playing with less actual playing experience than would seem likely given when you joined the site. The second is now even more apparent to me...the only other vote for you is from Bill, and I've been looking very dimly at Bill for some time (first trying to choose between Bill and wikki, and later Bill and you).</div></blockquote>\n\nNote that he doesn't have any new reasons for disliking his vote...the only thing that has changed is the size of the wagon. Once again, it really looks like Barry is just trying to help encourage wagons and keep himself alive.<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: penpen</span>", "time": "Tue Mar 01, 2011 12:17 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=16416&start=700", "forum": "53", "thread": "16416"}

He has a knack for finding himself snuggly in the middle of the biggest wagons. It's been mentioned many times, Barry plays very cautiously. I can't really decide if this is scummy or not. Add this to his strange counter-wagon defense, his refusal to outright say that he was accusing anyone of being scum by calling it a counter-wagon, yet claiming credit for scum hunting by labeling it a counter-wagon and a sense that he goes out of his way to avoid possible scum tells, and I'm quite suspicious of Barry. <br>\n<br>\nAs far as penpen goes... I just don't know. I'm leaning towards VI, but that hammer from yesterday was reckless. I'm not second guessing the GreyICE lynch, but I'm not sure penpen even realized he was casting the killing vote. Also, the fact that he's blaming his vote on Zito is troubling. He's looking very easily manipulated, which will become more and more of a liability as the town:scum ratio becomes worse.

The whole issue with Zito neglecting to even entertain the possibility that SE was a vig kill makes more sense as town than scum. It could be a purposeful trick, but it would be fairly subtle and rely on us eventually reading the flavor correctly and then coming back to notice his tell. It doesn't confirm him as town, but I do find it fairly compelling.

Do you still think those votes against you were a counter-wagon?</div></blockquote>In retrospect, no, I don't believe it was.  I was very annoyed by the BW at the time, and the timing of the BW and the non-vote post that supported it looked suspect to me at the time.  But, no, I no longer believe it was a counter-wagon.  As for Rob, his posts have read more town...the only questions being that he is still alive after claiming tracker, and that while his claim to have tracked Ash may be true, it could also be convenient.  Again, though, his posts otherwise seem to lean more town.  As for penpen, I've already stated several times that he is either VI or Scum and I'm still trying to sort out which it is.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nNow, let's get to the rest of subs post, which seems to bring to a head a trend I've noted in subs' posts against me...that of trying out a point, then redefining terms or twisting reality in order to make a wrong point \"fit\" his case...some examples here...\n<blockquote><div><cite>subgenius wrote:</cite>You could have voted in your first D2 post, you know, before your V/LA.</div></blockquote> Now that you have to recognize that my V/LA makes your point less valid about why I voted \"late\" in the tally, you now want to redefine the terms of your complaint as state that I should have simply posted an immediate vote D2.  <br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>subgenius wrote:</cite>Clearly, you didn't want to do it (OMGUS) because you thought it would look scummy, not because you feel it's unhelpful to town.</div></blockquote>This is another example of you redefining things...you call me out for not OMGUS'ing, I point out I've been consistent in my stand whether you like it or not, so you simply redefine things to imply a motivation for which you have no evidence...because you are making it up.  To reiterate,  I think OMGUS voting does not help the town, I thought it was bad enough that it was actually a part of my case on EA, and I still refuse to OMGUS vote.  If you think that you should vote for me because I don't like OMGUS voting, that's your right...but don't try to twist this into something else while you're at it.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>subgenius wrote:</cite> I think your refusal to engage your accusers out of fear of OMGUS is scummy.</div></blockquote>What part of my posts this round looks like I'm \"refusing to engage my accusers\"?  There are a lot of things you can say about me, but \"refusing to engage my accusers\" doesn't seem to fit here....and once again you are trying to redefine things when you are failing to make a point.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>subgenius wrote:</cite>\n1. I did give an example of your pandering:\n<blockquote><div><cite>Barry wrote:</cite>This and Rob&#8217;s later post are awfully convenient. If we are looking for a counterwagon, I believe we&#8217;ve found it. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">If you wish to follow it, remember who took you there.</div></div></blockquote></div></blockquote>THIS is your idea of \"pandering\"?  Really?  My simply stating that if someone BW'd me out of the round that you should remember who did it?  Wait, I thought I was \"afraid to engage my accusers\", but HERE I'm \"pandering\" when telling the town to remember them when I flip town.  You are not making a simple, straightforward case, but rather a series of unconnected and even contradictory arguments.\n<blockquote><div><cite>subgenius wrote:</cite>If you want to say it wasn't OMGUS, because you didn't vote, fine. We can make up a new name for accusing your wagoners without voting.</div></blockquote>I'm sure you CAN make up a new name - you've been redefining things all through your case.\n<blockquote><div><cite>subgenius wrote:</cite>3. It's easy to make a case and hop aboard. Just writing up a case doesn't mean you aren't sheeping.</div></blockquote>Once again redefining terms.  Before you accused me of NOT making cases...now you have to admit I AM making cases, but you still want to call it the same thing you did before so now it's \"making cases-style sheeping\".<br>\n<br>\nSub - you still could be an overzealous townie who can't see past the flaws in your own points.  What you definitely are doing is making points that don't hold up, then you are either redefining the terms, implying motivations to my statements that aren't there, or are making contradictory points in an attempt to shore up the original flawed argument.  <br>\n<br>\n1. I have consistently made a case with each vote, either in the post of the vote or before.  You may not like my cases - in fact you may completely disagree with them.  But that doesn't take away from the fact that I AM making cases when I vote.<br>\n2. I have a consistent dislike for OMGUS, using it as part of a case, and refusing to OMGUS vote even under high pressure from you to OMGUS.  If you disagree that OMGUS'ing is bad, that's your opinion.  What I cannot understand is how you can equate refusing to OMGUS with scum.  That's your point to make - but I don't believe it is a point that holds up to scrutiny.<br>\n3. If you want to hold me up to scrutiny, fair enough.  If you want to vote me, that is your right in this game.  If you want to keep redefining reality to make a point, I reserve the right to call you on it.  Again, at this point I think you could be an overzealous townie - what I know you are is wrong when it comes to your accusations.", "time": "Thu Mar 03, 2011 3:41 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=16416&start=800", "forum": "53", "thread": "16416"}

I'm amazed and honored to have made it this far.<br>\n<br>\nI have actually helped the town at more than one point in time, though obviously my goal has been to make it through to a win for myself, as any player in this position should do.  Here's my hits:<br>\n<br>\n1. Night one - Hitting Snake Eyes was a truly randomized hit.  Sorry SE.<br>\n2. Night two - I'm proud of this one.  I purposely went for a mafioso and hit Mozamis.  Looking back at the thread for D2, Mozamis looked the most scummy, and I did not want to see a clean sweep for the maf so I sent in the hit request and crossed my fingers.  <br>\n3. Day three - again, I wanted to bring this down to one maf left - and I didn't want to be lynched myself.  I was at L-2 at one point, remember.  Still, I suspected strongly that the town was right about AGar and when I saw the vote at L-1 I hammered.  Again, very proud to have hit that mafioso, bringing it down to one last bad guy for me to compete against (at least I hope it's just one).<br>\n4. Night three - I didn't want this to be just townies and me so I did purposely hit Subs for two reasons...First, to bring us to where we are today, and second...because I didn't suspect him of being maf. Not a nice thing, I realize, but at least I'm telling you exactly what happened.<br>\n<br>\nAs for my suspicions - I didn't have Zito high on my list, so if he turns up maf I'll feel really stupid.  I do think his \"clearing\" of EA makes much more sense in light of the mason flip for EA.  That leaves Pods and bvoigt.<br>\n<br>\nNow, Pods - I have had fun going back and forth with you in this round.  I don't know for sure your affiliation (though your last post makes me lean town read on you more than I ever have) - but going back and forth with you seemed to give me something to appear active about while keeping myself alive.<br>\n<br>\nThat would leave us with bvoigt as our likely mafioso...so let me clear my throat and do something that is just as unusual as claiming my role...I will ask the town to support the Serial Killer over the mafia.<br>\n<br>\nIf I am lynched today, you guarantee a mafioso victory.  The maf will hit one of the remaining townies, there will be a tie tomorrow, and the maf wins the next night.  Guaranteed.  If you lynch a townie, I am much better off hitting a townie and taking the draw or \"no result\" or whatever it would be with the mafia - so I would not be inclined to hit a suspected mafioso.  I would venture a guess that the last remaining maf would feel the same way - since our hitting each other would automatically mean we both lose. This means that my original statement is correct - right now there is no way for a town win to happen, though you are in the position to decide who does win.<br>\n<br>\nI may be the SK - but I have killed two mafioso (one by night hit and one by day hammer) and hope you remember that kindly as you decide how to vote.  I'm asking you to lynch the last mafioso.  If that last maf isn't you, Pods, then it is likely bvoigt...and I will:<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: bvoigt</span><br>\n<br>\nbvoigt - if you are maf please post your case as to why you should be allowed to win.

The incentive for the maf and I tonight would be to hit you and bvoigt and claim the tie.  I hate ties...but if necessary I'll take it.<br>\n<br>\nIf you lynch me, it's endgame time for the maf to win.  It's up to the GM if he wants to play this out to the end at that point, which would go as follows:<br>\n                     1. You lynch me and go to tonight with 2 town and one maf<br>\n                     2. Maf hits one of you tonight<br>\n                     3. Start tomorrow with one maf and one town, who tie into a no lynch<br>\n                     4. Maf hits last townie next night and wins<br>\n<br>\nSame goes for my win if you lynch the maf.<br>\n<br>\nThe only other choices are to lynch a townie or to go no lynch.  The only confusion with a no lynch would be if both the maf and I hit the same townie.  In that case we go to 1 maf, 1 SK and 1 town into tomorrow - and again the last townie is the kingmaker.<br>\n<br>\nIn other words, Papa Zito, there truly is no way for you to win.  The only way for you to win is for Pods and I to be stupid enough to hit each other.  Otherwise, if one of us hits town and the other is hit by the other, then you go to the next day with 1 maf (or 1 sk) and 1 town...again it plays out to a town loss.<br>\n<br>\nI don't know how to put this more clearly - the town has no chance.  I'll take a tie if I have to...even if that risks a maf victory by getting hit tonight.<br>\n<br>\nSo...Papa Zito, good luck - if you're still alive tomorrow you will be in the same place you are today, only with more time on your hands before the resolution.

Of course, this would require one of the scum to vote for one of the townies, and it's quite possible they would both refuse. With that in mind, I think you and Zito did it right, and were heading towards a good chance of cross-kills until Pod Person suggested no kill.

Props to all of you!<br>\n- Barry Allen: SK is always a tough role to pull of and he went through the game almost unsuspected for the whole time.<br>\n- Town play past D2: There was a pretty solid town core (EA, PZ, subgenius) and a pretty solid suspect core (mozamis, AGar, pod), so the townies made themselves very obvious.<br>\n- Mason staying hidden for so long. They're a powerful role, especially when it comes to LyLo.<br>\n<br>\nWhat didn't go well:<br>\n- Town play until N2: I believe GreyICE would've been a great asset for the town, but unfortunately he became victim of the random D1 lynch. And it becomes quite apparent again how hard it is to deal with VIs/inexperienced players. Nonetheless I think wikkiden should've gotten a lot more pressure for that glaring contradiction on D1. Very confusing town on the first two days.<br>\n- Mason play: Sorry, guys. But you had the scum team already pegged N1. And Hiraki was in your town reads. And you completely let the Hiraki lynch go through on D2 (although Hiraki didn't help his case by doing nothing). You failed to form a vote block that could've pressured the scum more.<br>\n- The mafia kill N1: There was a claimed tracker with three scum roles to catch and Papa Zito who had all of you pegged D1 and you go after a moderately townish person? If you can get rid of a town PR N1 you do it, no matter how shady that person looks. Claimed PRs don't get lynched on early days without a cc. Wasted kill.<br>\n- End game: Not your fault, but it's not the satisfactory ending I was hoping for.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nRegarding the setup:<br>\nI don't think the Mafia was overpowered at all if you take into account some things:<br>\n- A tracker who claims unprovoked Day 1 is a huge blow for town. He could've tracked all three scum so it'd be in the best interest to stay hidden as long as possible.<br>\n- The mafia watcher was basically useless with only one role to catch.<br>\n- The mafia doc may be a bit more useful than a town doc, but he is very dangerous for his team if he flips after he has claimed.<br>\n<br>\nI probably would tweak it if I would run it again, but not by much (get rid of the goon/limit the SK in some way).<br>\n<br>\nIn the end, the town maybe deserved the win since two mislynches is borderline in a mini and they played overall well for the second part of the game. But as I said in the Dead QT, they got punished for their bad first two days and just weren't lucky enough with cross kills.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Ashblade wrote:</cite>Oh, Barry killed me. LOL, no wonder I died.</div></blockquote>\nSorry, I mixed up Barry and Bill. You were in fact the mafia kill and I fixed it in the other post.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>bvoigt wrote:</cite>BTW, what would have been the best way to play in the 1:1:2 endgame?</div></blockquote>\nWell, when pod proposed to lynch PZ, the confirmed town, I wish PZ wouldn't have dismissed it right away. Whoever PZ suspected at that moment, it was obivous that the two remaining scum didn't who each other were. Which would've increased the likelihood of an unintentional cross kill and a subsequent town win by a lot. Of course, there's a lot of inside knowledge mod talk in here, but this seemed to be the best way for town to still have a shot at winning.<br>\n<br>\nI hope you still enjoyed the game as much as I did.<br>\n<br>\nFun fact: Scum hammered all three times.

In 3:9's for instance, the town win rate was floundering at around 36% - doesn't it seem strange to you in a game with one more scum, the town is producing better results? (Note: I'm using 12 player games here because the sample size for 13 isn't large enough)<br>\n<br>\nThe reason is crosskills. In games with additional kills at night, whether they be from a vig or SK, they are producing a higher ratio of non-mafia kills to mafia kills, diluting their influence - mafia no longer get to decide 50% of the kills in the game. This weakened influence with their own NK, coupled with the risk of being picked off at night severely bites into mafia's chances of winning. It's an admittedly swingy mechanism to balance a game, as a small to large piece of the game is out of town's hands, but this is the baggage you need to accept when playing in a multiple scum game. Personally, I prefer not playing in games with two mafia factions or a mafia/SK, for this very reason. It makes the game increasingly chaotic and dependent on what happens with the kills, which isn't fun for me. However, many players and mods like the SK role, so we're going to have to convince them otherwise here.  <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\"> <br>\n<br>\nTo speak from a more anecdotal perspective, many 3:1:8's in the past have had similar balances of power; a Bulletproof SK, or maybe a mafia GF with investigation or NK immunity, against 2-3 town powers. I think it's easy to be deceived into thinking the mafia was overpowered this game, because they have two PR's. But lets look at what they actually do; the Doctor - he offers protection to one mafia member out of three. This is only useful against the SK, and unlike being a NK-immune GF, the scumteam can lose this power by the Doc being NK'ed (or lynched). The Watcher for mafia does very little this game - it can only catch one town PR, and the SK is immune to it. The reason for masons existing in the game, is so town have a small core of power that isn't able to be manipulated by scum's powers. <br>\n<br>\nI think it's also important to remember, with 3:1:8's producing relatively even contests (despite being swingy), we're now adding in an extra townie, which should be another town benefit. I think it's easy to look at the set-up and scan the roles, and go, <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">\"hang on, 3 town PR's against 4 scum? That isn't right!\"</div> But crosskills are a particularly fickle mechanic that rip through the heart of a scum team as easily as it can obliterate town, and it's kind of sucky that this mechanic is what plays a big part in determining the outcome of Mafia/SK games - it's probably that feeling that you don't have much control over the outcome as a townie that makes it appear unbalanced. But that is the nature of the beast!", "time": "Wed Mar 23, 2011 2:22 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=16416&start=1275", "forum": "53", "thread": "16416"}

Masons are weaker than 9:3 because preventing mislynches is much less important due to two kills. Sk was weakened to give town a chance.

One of the reasons why we upgraded to 13 players over 12 was to better balance two core set-ups; 3:9 --&gt; 3:10 and 3:1:8 --&gt; 3:1:9. As I said just before, it's quite easy to have things not go your way at night, but additional town power wouldn't have solved that - infact, that would have probably painted more of a target on that player, minimising the chance of crosskills, which are a huge help for towns in 3:1:9's.<br>\n<br>\nThe SK is a particularly awkward role to balance in Minis, without making the game swingy. Because by nature, the very inclusion of two killing forces at night is going to produce a swingy game, where crosskills are crucial.", "time": "Wed Mar 23, 2011 2:30 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=16416&start=1275", "forum": "53", "thread": "16416"}
