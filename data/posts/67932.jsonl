He's saying that he's not defending him for his contradiction (and you can see that the primary reason is because of a fast wagon). The second part is backing up his read.

This also depends on how you interpreter it, most people think that town shouldn't ever lie (I think that's wrong on certain situations) but town can contradict themselves in games with adjusted reads, forgetting or just reading incorrectly. I wouldn't consider these situations as a lie (just to point out the terrible reasoning from yourself in the argument).<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8244320#p8244320\" class=\"postlink\">post 778</a>, BlackStar wrote:</cite>Weak ATE</div></blockquote><br><br>If it's weak, why is it in your case?<br>You posted yourself that people see you as scummy, so how can you even consider adding this?<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8244320#p8244320\" class=\"postlink\">post 778</a>, BlackStar wrote:</cite>If you don't think he's town, why have you been questioning his wagon?

You're assuming that I think that contradictions are just inherently scummy, which I don't. It depends on the person making the contradictions. I've said that n00b town are more prone to making contradictions and plus, the one that Snake made was so minor that a speed wagon like that is suspect. If contradictions were just plain scummy, I'd be voting Zyf right now whose made a couple himself, but I'm not. Also, apparently, using your logic, Zyf is scum right alongside me because he's denied making contradictions aswell by saying he was \"exaggerating.\" I find it hard to believe you think Zyf and I are both scum.<br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>His logic is ripped apart here and instead of acknowledging that, he weakly tries to keep justifying what he said.</div></blockquote><br>Ripped apart? lmfao. How was my logic ripped apart? Mimi said that it wasn't impossible for a n00b town to come and try to show it off, only that he hadn't seen it himself.

If I was trying to distance myself from my scum partner, that means I would have voted him outright with some lame excuse instead of questioning his wagon. Questioning his wagon WHEN NO ELSE WAS will make it almost impossible for people to not scumread him and I together. Apparently, according to you, I would reveal myself and my scum partner just a couple pages into a game. Yeah....no.<br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Weak ATE</div></blockquote><br>Weren't you the one that said that you get ML'd as town aswell? <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif\" alt=\":roll:\" title=\"Rolling Eyes\"> <br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>If you don't think he's town, why have you been questioning his wagon?

His contradiction itself isn't enough for me to scum read him, but he also hasn't done anything to this point that would make me say he's town OUTRIGHT. A slight(and I mean slight) town read comes from me thinking he's a n00b town who contradicted himself. His replace post indicates to me that my feelings are not unfounded. <br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Another contradiction</div></blockquote><br>That wasn't a contradiction.

Xkfyu is probably scum.  On the fence on Sonia.  Zyf could easily be scum.  To be honest don't have a good read one way or the other at this point.  Seems like one of algebra/Tiershift are scum.  Obviously eagerSnake had a bad intro, but it feels like it may have just been overeager town, especially since I've liked your play since then for the most part."}

And I'll admit I'm a sucker for a fake rage-quit. If it's all a hustle, good for her, you got me.  My only concern here is her seeming protection of saru. If it were just \"I have a strong townread on saru\" I feel like she'd say that more explicitly rather than trying to derail.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">mimi</span>- I like 558 for its content and 908 for its tone. There's a fearlessness here that feels natural.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">zyf</span>- in spite of myself. I find it very unlikely that the tripartaite superposters of zyf/sonia/trans are all town, but in general he's a guy out there trying to make cases, which is good.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Nullish:</span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">saru</span>- not much to like here. His \"woe is me\" 543 is bad, and the possible white knighting by sonia doesn't help.

His only \"scumhunting\" of late has been to jump on my earlier claim that trans scumslipped and ask faux-innocent questions about it without taking ownership. 932 is bad, in particular: \"do we know if there are werewolves\" is a statement designed to look like a townslip.  And I do not understand 716 or 731 at all.  In any way.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">fos Xkfyu</span>- nothing to like here. My only reservation (seriously) is that he's verging on \"too scummy to be scum.\"  Detailed above. His readlist is an opportunistic sham, he scumslipped in his defense of blackstar, derailed his own tier wagon without explanation. If he's scum, tier probably is too.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">fos Transcend</span>- I still think 157 and 283 are, combined, a scumslip. The way he casually calls me town (for no reason as far as I could see), then pivots from \"mafia\" to \"wolves\" in the oh-so-innocent 283 setup speculation. This is a put-on. I know he's an action scum player, which fits.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">fos texcat</span>- lurkerscum. 740 is upsettingly bad. He mocks everyone's terrible cases only to reach back for a lurker and a case based on one post, 600 posts prior.  I see an outside chance of a tex/xkfyu/tier pairing here, with xkfyu casting a vote for and then heavy-handedly derailing tier's wagon and tex trying to make sure he doesn't do the same thing.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: xkfyu</span><br><br>Now, then, I'm caught up.

Waste of a vote. <br>3) Not voting either today, but seems likely one is scum.  Not the only person to have this stance. <br>4) Day 1 reads should be fairly fluid, because anyone with a firm list is either overconfident or ignorant.

Holy shit. Now I know how feels to have to read like 8 pages lmfao. Also, hey Dwlee! <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\"><br><br>Anyways, I'm caught up and honestly I don't understand the votes on Zyf/Dwlee. They are town. Their claim makes all the sense in the world with their explanation and honestly, scum just wouldn't shoot themselves in the foot trying to get like a million people lynched all on D1, especially with the amount of shit reasoning he's been using. His strange actions match up with his claim. It's simple as that. <br><br>As for BlackStar, I don't really think he's scum. His case against me seemed like it was rushed(he somewhat admits to this) and he picked up on that when I countered him and decided he was probably wrong. Town can admit they're wrong too(just look at Zyf). As for him not scum hunting after my wagon, he did note that he was busy that entire day. RL is a thing. Null on him until he puts some actual work in. <br><br>As for the votes on Xkfyu, I don't feel they're far-fetched but not all that great. He was the catalyst that got people to jump off my wagon(which scum has no reason to derail in that situation, expect maybe town points for WK), but his own reason for jumping off(that a scum would never claim VT/be suicidal in that situation) felt a little weak, albeit genuine. His later play of voting Transcend for some weird scumslip(I really don't get how that was a scumslip?) is suspicious, as Zyf pointed out. His later play in general has been pretty scummy with no real reasons for his votes. It feels like he's just throwing stuff against a wall and seeing what sticks. I have a scumlean read on him.<br><br>As for Transcend, reading his ISO, he just feels like a cocky person. His fight with Xkfyu early on in the game seems to be a part of that. That doesn't make him town or scum either way, but he needs an ego check lmfao. I noticed this from him in my re-read:<br><blockquote><div><cite>Transcend wrote:</cite>Lowell my bud, there's a good chance any lynch i want today will go through. So in order to be in the majority, you gotta sheep me <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\";)\" title=\"Wink\"></div></blockquote><br>Which given that he's been pushing my lynch most of D1 with crap reasoning, it feels like he's just crying that he didn't get his way as he was hoping. Poor guy. He's null for now.<br><br>This isn't a full fledged reads list, but it's somewhat of a start, so I'm not going to vote any one person yet as I need to work on some other people.<br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: </span>"}

If you strongly believe someone is scum of course you're gonna push for their lynch. That's normal. What Sonia was sayinf was that she thinks Dw is scum so she isn't going to pay attention to his reads at all. Those are two different things. You rushing to point out the \"hypocrisy\" felt like a desperate scum attempt to cast doubt. And then you did it again when I called your post awful."}

He just wanted his scum reads lynched and that's it, he wasn't going to have it any other way. That kind of player is THE WORST type of player to listen to for lynch advice, because they're drowned in conf-bias or just plain hubris.</div></div></div><br><div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: BlackStar is scum</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display: none;\">Anyways, after much re-reading, I'm starting to notice a pattern developing between two players. BlackStar and Xkfyu. Let me start with BlackStar:<br>This guy has coasted the entire game. Go look at his ISO. At no point does he actually build competent cases on people before he votes them. All he does is take other people's scum reads and run with them without much reasoning as to why he HIMSELF scum reads that individual. The only time he made a case was on me ONLY AFTER he was prompted by Vedith to do so. He even admitted that he made the case up on the spot, and his case on me was riddled with reach reasoning and he picked up on that when I countered him, hence his unvote. He's been on all the major wagons on D1(Snake, Saru, Zyf, and Transcend). I'm not going to quote every post that he's made, but every time he votes someone, it's always a BLANK vote with no actual reasoning attached. His pattern is this: comment on another player's scum read, play to their doubts about their scum read, then outright vote the largest wagon, and finally get off when the wagon disbands. Rinse and repeat. Just take a gander at his ISO and you'll see what I'm talking about. Oh, and surprise, surprise, whose wagon is BlackStar on now? Take a guess. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif\" alt=\":roll:\" title=\"Rolling Eyes\"> <br>I think Vedith nicely summed up how I feel about BlackStar:<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8265335#p8265335\" class=\"postlink\">post 1488</a>, Vedith wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8265333#p8265333\" class=\"postlink\">post 1487</a>, BlackStar wrote:</cite>It pinged me too, but I thought I was being paranoid</div></blockquote><br>Aren't you an oportunist...</div></blockquote></div></div></div><br><div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: And Xkfyu is his partner</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display: none;\">Now, what's the case about Xkfyu? Xkfyu is more of an associative scum read with BlackStar. Go take a quick look at the interactions between BlackStar and Xkfyu. The way they talk to each other is almost TOO friendly. Again, I'm not going to quote every post, but just a quick gander at the ISO's of both BlackStar and Xkfyu in tandem should give you an idea of what I'm talking about. BlackStar almost never asks inquisitive questions to anyone else in the thread BUT Xkfyu. He throws a couple of questions towards Xkfyu to make it look like he's trying, and then after Xkfyu answers, he doesn't follow through. This is classic scum play. Ask questions towards your scum partners only so that it looks like you're being a helpful townie. It's not like your scum partner is going to get mad/annoyed at you for it, so they're a safe option to throw questions at. They'll answer how they should and move on. FWIW, masons also do this to avoid looking scummy, as I did with my mason partner in Mini 1800, but I HIGHLY doubt we have masons in this game given the claims so far. There's more that I can point out about the relationship between BlackStar and Xkfyu but I'm not going to make this wall any bigger than it needs to be, I think I've made my point clear. If anyone needs more evidence, I'll be happy to provide.</div></div></div><br><div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: Who Else Is Scum?</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display: none;\">I'm glad you asked. The answer is: most likely Tiershift. I came to this conclusion like this: I looked at the people who were hardcore lurking for most of D1(Gerry, Algebra, Texcat, and Tiershift). Why look at the lurkers? Well, I've played enough games as scum to know that there is almost always that one lurkscum. This is that person in your school's group project who sits on their ass all day while you do all the fucking work. Why work when both of your partners are taking care of things, amirite? Anyways, I can eliminate Algebra from this because there's no real reason for me to doubt his claim/cc. Gerry's lurking has been one of the worst so far, however, his recent screaming match with Sonia felt like TvT. So I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt at the moment. This could change. This leaves Texcat and Tiershift. So which one is it? Tiershift says he might vote either Texcat OR Xkfyu at some point, which seems...strange. Bussing his partner(Xkfyu) wouldn't make much sense here. Voting Texcat however, I can see him doing that as scum(seeing as a Texcat wagon was BOUND to form today). The fact that he keeps either option open is suspect. He didn't really scum read Texcat at any point D1(and even partially defended her), so why would he even THINK of voting Texcat at a time like this? He said that Transcend is a trash player, so his reasoning can't be that \"I'm going to vote Texcat because Transcend said to do so\" because why would he be listening to such a trash player in that case? Or did he suddenly fall in love with Dwlee's case on Texcat which he was shit-talking just the day before? Either way, it doesn't look good. So in a match-up between Tier and Tex, Tier just comes out plainly more scummy. Sure, Tex hasn't done much at the moment, but the little that she has done isn't enough for me to TR or SR either way. However, the work that Tier has done(as of recent) has just been looking really bad. This ends up being more of a PoE scum read that can change however, because I'm not so full of hubris to think I'm 3/3.</div></div></div><br>There are like 2 others things I wanted to address, but I'm going to hold off on those right now because it's not really that essential at the moment, and it'll just make this whole wall unnecessarily bigger than it already is. I'll probably talk about them in a later post.<br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: BlackStar</span>"}

Your first game ever of mafia, I presume, by the way you were asking basic questions. This is a TERRIBLE sample to show right off the bat. The majority of the players in that game were newbies themselves at the time, so one can confidently say that their reads aren't going to be all that well developed. They'll look at the tiniest thing to scum read someone, because they want to be UBER L33T scum hunters. Unless you think me noticing that you've put naked votes on all 4 major wagons is just pointing out tiny things, I don't really think comparing my scum read on you to newbies' scum read of you is a fair comparison. I'm not going to give this game much weight, if at all.<br><br>Second game is a blitz game. Again, this is not really a great sample due to it's nature. Even after reading through the thread, I don't see much in the way of actual scum hunting from players on D1. Seems like most of them were concerned with getting a lynch out before the deadline(it is a blitz after all) rather than actually taking the time to make competent cases on people. And I don't really think people lynched you JUST BECAUSE they were scum reading you(a few of them even voted you REGARDLESS of them having a TR on you). Again, I don't think my scum read of you comes from any kind of want to lynch before a deadline. Comparing my scum read of you in this game to a blitz is no bueno. Sorry amigo.<br><br>And, finally, the last game, an actual sample. Finally. Thank you. I'm not going to read through 213 pages, so if you can tell me why you think people were scum reading you on D1 and why you were almost lynched 3 times, that'd be nice. Specifically if you can quote me posts where people were scum reading you for pushing major wagons for little to no reasoning, that'd be even better. Essentially, I'm looking to see if your \"scummy townie\" play here(as you asserted on D1) matches up with any of your past games. Supposedly \"80%.\" If I see a clear pattern of you doing this, then I'd be willing to say \"oh that's just how BlackStar plays as town, no biggie\" but I really doubt that is the case. Feel free to prove me wrong."}

Someon made what looked like a scum slip and a wagon started to form. One person said \"We found scum guys, lets lynch him!\" or something to that effect and then I said \"Do you really think scum would make it that easy to find them?\" and then throughout the day people kept trying to say that I was defending that scummy guy so that meant the two of us were scum buddies. And when I'm under pressure, people say that I react badly and use bad logic so then more people scum read me. When I got to L-2 I self voted to get the wagon off me and it worked and then it came back on me later for some reason I don't remember. If you want to see if my playstyle lines up in this game with my usual town play, look at any of my games. I only have one scum game.

You did it with blackstar (if blackstar is scum, we kill xfk and tiershift) and now you're doing it with texcat (if texcat is scum, we lynch tier). You cannot find reasons to scumread players, so you just associatively scumread them, which is the easiest for scum to fake.<br><br>Next, you indicated that you dislike the texcat wagon and now you jump on it with the justification that me and texcat defend each other? That cancels out the whole disgust that you had before?<br><br>And do not try me with the 'being specific is not your forte' remarks. That's just plain unnecessary.<br><br>So what I want to know is who you really think is scum here. Before you thought it was blackstar, now it's suddenly texcat based on almost nothing. Who do you scumread by something else than associations?<br><br>It's sad that you just throw me in your scumpile by first saying I'm blackstar's and xfkyu's buddy and then 1 page or so later i'm suddenly texcat's buddy.

Dwlee's case on Texcat seems to be a case of town conf-bias. Also, voting Texcat because Transcend yelled \"ZOMG ALL THESE PEOPLE ARE SCUM! LYNCH THEM AFTER I FLIP GREEN!\" is really fucking stupid. Let's face it, Transcend is a toxic player, and the more a toxic player gets angry, the more they will burrow themselves into their shit hole and will refuse to see reason. The fact that Transcend was saying that people \"hard scum claimed\"(obvious exaggeration) is enough to show that his state of mind was nowhere near the kind to make informed decisions. He just wanted his scum reads lynched and that's it, he wasn't going to have it any other way. That kind of player is THE WORST type of player to listen to for lynch advice, because they're drowned in conf-bias or just plain hubris.</div></div></div><br><div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: BlackStar is scum</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display: none;\">Anyways, after much re-reading, I'm starting to notice a pattern developing between two players. BlackStar and Xkfyu. Let me start with BlackStar:<br>This guy has coasted the entire game. Go look at his ISO. At no point does he actually build competent cases on people before he votes them. All he does is take other people's scum reads and run with them without much reasoning as to why he HIMSELF scum reads that individual. The only time he made a case was on me ONLY AFTER he was prompted by Vedith to do so. He even admitted that he made the case up on the spot, and his case on me was riddled with reach reasoning and he picked up on that when I countered him, hence his unvote. He's been on all the major wagons on D1(Snake, Saru, Zyf, and Transcend). I'm not going to quote every post that he's made, but every time he votes someone, it's always a BLANK vote with no actual reasoning attached. His pattern is this: comment on another player's scum read, play to their doubts about their scum read, then outright vote the largest wagon, and finally get off when the wagon disbands. Rinse and repeat. Just take a gander at his ISO and you'll see what I'm talking about. Oh, and surprise, surprise, whose wagon is BlackStar on now? Take a guess. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif\" alt=\":roll:\" title=\"Rolling Eyes\"> <br>I think Vedith nicely summed up how I feel about BlackStar:<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8265335#p8265335\" class=\"postlink\">post 1488</a>, Vedith wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8265333#p8265333\" class=\"postlink\">post 1487</a>, BlackStar wrote:</cite>It pinged me too, but I thought I was being paranoid</div></blockquote><br>Aren't you an oportunist...</div></blockquote></div></div></div><br><div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: And Xkfyu is his partner</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display: none;\">Now, what's the case about Xkfyu? Xkfyu is more of an associative scum read with BlackStar. Go take a quick look at the interactions between BlackStar and Xkfyu. The way they talk to each other is almost TOO friendly. Again, I'm not going to quote every post, but just a quick gander at the ISO's of both BlackStar and Xkfyu in tandem should give you an idea of what I'm talking about. BlackStar almost never asks inquisitive questions to anyone else in the thread BUT Xkfyu. He throws a couple of questions towards Xkfyu to make it look like he's trying, and then after Xkfyu answers, he doesn't follow through. This is classic scum play. Ask questions towards your scum partners only so that it looks like you're being a helpful townie. It's not like your scum partner is going to get mad/annoyed at you for it, so they're a safe option to throw questions at. They'll answer how they should and move on. FWIW, masons also do this to avoid looking scummy, as I did with my mason partner in Mini 1800, but I HIGHLY doubt we have masons in this game given the claims so far. There's more that I can point out about the relationship between BlackStar and Xkfyu but I'm not going to make this wall any bigger than it needs to be, I think I've made my point clear. If anyone needs more evidence, I'll be happy to provide.</div></div></div><br><div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: Who Else Is Scum?</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display: none;\">I'm glad you asked. The answer is: most likely Tiershift. I came to this conclusion like this: I looked at the people who were hardcore lurking for most of D1(Gerry, Algebra, Texcat, and Tiershift). Why look at the lurkers? Well, I've played enough games as scum to know that there is almost always that one lurkscum. This is that person in your school's group project who sits on their ass all day while you do all the fucking work. Why work when both of your partners are taking care of things, amirite? Anyways, I can eliminate Algebra from this because there's no real reason for me to doubt his claim/cc. Gerry's lurking has been one of the worst so far, however, his recent screaming match with Sonia felt like TvT. So I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt at the moment. This could change. This leaves Texcat and Tiershift. So which one is it? Tiershift says he might vote either Texcat OR Xkfyu at some point, which seems...strange. Bussing his partner(Xkfyu) wouldn't make much sense here. Voting Texcat however, I can see him doing that as scum(seeing as a Texcat wagon was BOUND to form today). The fact that he keeps either option open is suspect. He didn't really scum read Texcat at any point D1(and even partially defended her), so why would he even THINK of voting Texcat at a time like this? He said that Transcend is a trash player, so his reasoning can't be that \"I'm going to vote Texcat because Transcend said to do so\" because why would he be listening to such a trash player in that case? Or did he suddenly fall in love with Dwlee's case on Texcat which he was shit-talking just the day before? Either way, it doesn't look good. So in a match-up between Tier and Tex, Tier just comes out plainly more scummy. Sure, Tex hasn't done much at the moment, but the little that she has done isn't enough for me to TR or SR either way. However, the work that Tier has done(as of recent) has just been looking really bad. This ends up being more of a PoE scum read that can change however, because I'm not so full of hubris to think I'm 3/3.</div></div></div><br>There are like 2 others things I wanted to address, but I'm going to hold off on those right now because it's not really that essential at the moment, and it'll just make this whole wall unnecessarily bigger than it already is. I'll probably talk about them in a later post.<br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: BlackStar</span></div></blockquote><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8278454#p8278454\" class=\"postlink\">post 1735</a>, Saru wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8278328#p8278328\" class=\"postlink\">post 1731</a>, TierShift wrote:</cite>Saru is playing like shit and basing 2/3 of his reads off of preflip interactions which is really really bad<br><br>I'm rethinking this town read</div></blockquote><br>So what about my read on you then?

I'm used to in-person werewolf, so daytalk just feels wrong to me in some sense and also kind of feels like it makes it too easy for scum to get out of difficult situations.  But it does add another interesting element, even if it's not something I like."}

It all made perfect sense, but left me wondering why I find this game so difficult when [SHE] makes it sound so easy.</div></blockquote> The answer is: experience.<br>Between alts, hydras, and games that have been wiped from existence thanks to rollbacks, I've got over 200 games of experience.<br>There was a great video I listened to once. I wish I could remember enough of it to find it again (a quick browse of TVTropes, where I found it from, isn't showing it where I thought it would be), but basically, the video told about how this one guy took on the persona of a fortune teller, I believe it was.<br>And people would come in. At first, he would have to ask a lot of questions to get an idea for the person. With tricks, he would be able to get more and more specific, until he was able to identify their problem. He kept doing this over the course of a single day. And at the end of the day, he had gotten so good at it that when a lady walked in--without her saying anything--he was able to (accurately) tell her, \"You recently lost your husband\" (I believe it was that, anyway), and that is more or less the progression I went through to read players.<br><br>Given enough games, I can just look at a person. Never played with them before! And I can just guess facts about them from what they've said. Things like if they're an alt, and if not, how new they are. Things like how long they've been playing. Things like how cynical or idealistic they are. How they think, how they operate. Will it give me a perfect picture, no. But it's good to know.<br><br>It's not something which can really be taught. You can be shown the basics, walked through them step-by-step like I did in there, showing how I'd go about it. You can then use those basics to get started, to guide you through the process. But it's only through experience that you're able to actually let these skills sink in.<br><br>Try it for a while.<br>It won't work at first, but keep trying it. Keep trying it, and see what you get right and what you get wrong. Experience does the rest."}

It might seem like a catch-22, where you can't convince people using gut but you can't get away with lying, however, I've found workarounds to that.<br>Namely, if you can find specific posts to point to that your gut is particularly triggering on, you can do that; if you can't find any and it's just an \"in general\" thing, try to find a different way of explaining: \"Their tone feels artificial\", \"their posting doesn't look like it is furthering a town wincon\", \"their interactions look stifled\", etc.<br>Now, granted. You could argue that all of the above are just different ways of saying \"gut\".<br>But they <span style=\"font-style: italic\">sound</span> better, so you can be more persuasive when using them. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\"><br><br>In short: if you're faced with the dilemma of choosing between a gut read you can't explain and a logical read you can, go with the gut read and find a way to explain it, rather than falling back to the logical read.<br><br>This is my quick-patch version.<br>(My more advanced theory version delves into the idea that logic/gut stem from the same thing if you trace the root back far enough, though that's a little harder to explain succinctly.)"}
