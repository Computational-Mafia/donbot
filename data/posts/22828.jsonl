Play for fun. Don't be rude to other players.<br><br>2) Play to win, but also to have fun. See rule 1.<br><br>3) I will post in red. No one else is to use red.<br><br>4) Do not quote any private communications with me or other players. Failure to adhere to this rule will result in a modkill or a forced-replacement. If you have a question about whether something is acceptable, PM me.<br><br>5) You may not talk about this game outside the thread unless your role allows. When a player is killed, with the exception of a modkill, they will be given a link to a \u201cgreen room.\u201d In this room, you may choose to keep playing and discussing with other deceased players. If you have a partner/partners, do not disclose their name(s). This thread WILL be posted in post game.<br><br>6) Do not edit or delete your posts. You WILL be modkilled.<br><br>7) Posting in twilight is acceptable, for both the lynchee and all alive players. Feel free to post as much or as little as you want of whatever you like.<br><br>8) Once your death scene is posted, you may not talk. No \u2018Bah\u2019 post, or someone on your team will be punished for your screw-up.<br><br>9) If you fake breaking a rule, it will incur the same punishment as actually breaking the rule.<br><br>10) If you believe I have made a small mistake, for example, in a vote count, please point it out in thread. If you have a more serious grievance for some reason, PM me. Leave it out of the thread.<br><br>11) My word is final.<br><br>13) I reserve the right to add rules if necessary.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Activity:</span><br><br>14) I expect everyone to post every 48 hours (weekends are considered only 24hrs total). Failure to do so will result in an activity prod. I will prod and if there is no post within 24 hours of prod, you will be replaced. More than two prods in the same game day will result in a modkill or a forced replacement, in which I have sole discretion in picking the limit or consequence.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Voting/Deadline:</span><br><br>15) To vote. Please vote in bold as such. <span class=\"noboldsig\">vote: playerA</span>. You do not have to unvote to vote again. You may vote for a no lynch. For voting accuracy, I ask that you place your vote at the beginning or the end of your post (this is not mandatory, but it would be appreciated).<br><br>16) Deadline will be exactly 12 days from the death scene, every game day.<br><br>17) At deadline, majority is cut in half rounded up (D1 deadline lynch would be 7 players / 2 = 3.5 players = 4 to lynch). If there is a tie, the player with the most votes first, will be lynched.</span></span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vanilla Townie Role:</span><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>You are a Vanilla Townie.

No, I'm taking the onus of making strong accusations to lead the game since we stagnated. So replacing suspicion off me? Nope. I'm not doing that. I'm bringing attention to myself on things I find wrong with you.<br><br>2. The back track comes from an accusation to retreating to \"it simply was RVS and I don't have a read\". RVS is meant to generate reads. You haven't. You are deflecting the point when pacman brought it up by calling it a forced reasoning. In RVS you shouldn't be justifying your attacks, you are sending feelers around. Hence the point of the early game to test people.<br><br>Finding a reason to justify a RVS is forced defence if someone questions you on it. This is a scum mindset because <span class=\"noboldsig\"> it means you're looking for a reason to explain your actions in a way that makes you townie when the action in itself is null since it's early game </span>. Hence why I found the interactions to be revealing of your scumminess.<br><br>3. No, I'm not panicky. I'm attacking Thor for this point because as we both agree the statement is counterproductive to the town. I could care less if he pushes for me. But it was an opening for me to enter the game, so I pushed on it. Brushing it off as a joke is fine, but I chose to start here because it piqued my interest and I wanted Thor to respond. But sadly I'm dead.<br><br>4. It's early game, and I explained how your actions are scummy while I disagree with Pacman and Konowa on a theory level. Theory and game play =/= a person's scumminess. These are different issues entirely."}

I gave said reason. This is a bit moot since rBlinker admitted he forced a reason for his vote and you were right, but the whole random vote with an explanation didn't mean that there were problems for it. The truth comes from how rapid canyon would reply to the accusation which would lead us to reaction test and make an alignment call. <br><br>The attack on the vote diffuses the situation. <br><br>However I find that this is more of a play style difference that I disagree on since I would rather wait and see a person's reaction to see the full chain of events then attack rBlinker in media res of his RV.<br><br>2.

This is my first game, thank you very much. So excuse me for not living up to your expectations. And what it really means is that logically, rblinker123 is scum, but my gut tells me that you are and I don't know why. It has nothing to do with your play style. I kid when I say \"it's too rough and that's why\", because you demand an answer for a gut feeling. Which there is no answer to. My git has been wrong before in irl mafia, so I'm not going to just jump the gun and follow it to the end of the world.<br><br>What do I want to know? I want to know what he thinks of the situation. Is that so wrong? He asked about me, I am simply returning the gesture.<br><br>As for your \"pop quick\" (what is a pop quick anyway?): if we assume he is scum, if ANYONE is scum, then most people would naturally kill pacman. Why? Because if pacman is confirmed town, then he becomes a major threat in Lylo. Sure, a few people, including myself, noted that there may have been a GF, but if he wasn't the GF (obv not one), then you would have to fight him on that point. And honestly, the chance of turning that around on him is much harder than just killing him and leading the game back to \"no one really knows who anyone really is\". That is why you are probably still alive, assuming that YOU are not the scum.<br>Because that is also another valid argument. You are alive because you are scum, and rblinker123 is just playing very VERY poorly. It's also an easy answer for why you're alive.<br><img src=\"http://cache.ohinternet.com/images/1/13/Awesome.png\" alt=\"Image\"><br>Plus by simply asking this, you make me step into the shoes of scum, which you could twist into saying that \"only scum would say that! you're scum!\".

If you think \"He said he was cop and after all the VT claims, even though I wanted him dead so bad before, I now believe him\" is a case, then do I ever have a case on you. Yeah, he was a cop, but like I said, that couldn't be confirmed without killing him anyway, and there was still a GF possibility, which would have made him just a regular townie anyway.
