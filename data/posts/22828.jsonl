No one else is to use red.<br>\n<br>\n4) Do not quote any private communications with me or other players. Failure to adhere to this rule will result in a modkill or a forced-replacement. If you have a question about whether something is acceptable, PM me.<br>\n<br>\n5) You may not talk about this game outside the thread unless your role allows. When a player is killed, with the exception of a modkill, they will be given a link to a &#8220;green room.&#8221; In this room, you may choose to keep playing and discussing with other deceased players. If you have a partner/partners, do not disclose their name(s). This thread WILL be posted in post game.<br>\n<br>\n6) Do not edit or delete your posts. You WILL be modkilled.<br>\n<br>\n7) Posting in twilight is acceptable, for both the lynchee and all alive players. Feel free to post as much or as little as you want of whatever you like.<br>\n<br>\n8) Once your death scene is posted, you may not talk. No &#8216;Bah&#8217; post, or someone on your team will be punished for your screw-up.<br>\n<br>\n9) If you fake breaking a rule, it will incur the same punishment as actually breaking the rule.<br>\n<br>\n10) If you believe I have made a small mistake, for example, in a vote count, please point it out in thread.

More than two prods in the same game day will result in a modkill or a forced replacement, in which I have sole discretion in picking the limit or consequence.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Voting/Deadline:</div><br>\n<br>\n15) To vote.

You're back tracking on some pacman pressure about an RVS vote. I found the first vote ok, country to Pacman's reasoning (I don't see how a statement of fact makes an argument forced if it's true). But your defence that \"the vote was forced because it was RVS and you're recanting on your reasoning because it was an unfounded point\" makes you scummy.

This is my first game, thank you very much. So excuse me for not living up to your expectations. And what it really means is that logically, rblinker123 is scum, but my gut tells me that you are and I don't know why. It has nothing to do with your play style. I kid when I say \"it's too rough and that's why\", because you demand an answer for a gut feeling. Which there is no answer to. My git has been wrong before in irl mafia, so I'm not going to just jump the gun and follow it to the end of the world.<br>\n<br>\nWhat do I want to know? I want to know what he thinks of the situation. Is that so wrong? He asked about me, I am simply returning the gesture.<br>\n<br>\nAs for your \"pop quick\" (what is a pop quick anyway?): if we assume he is scum, if ANYONE is scum, then most people would naturally kill pacman. Why? Because if pacman is confirmed town, then he becomes a major threat in Lylo. Sure, a few people, including myself, noted that there may have been a GF, but if he wasn't the GF (obv not one), then you would have to fight him on that point. And honestly, the chance of turning that around on him is much harder than just killing him and leading the game back to \"no one really knows who anyone really is\". That is why you are probably still alive, assuming that YOU are not the scum.<br>\nBecause that is also another valid argument. You are alive because you are scum, and rblinker123 is just playing very VERY poorly. It's also an easy answer for why you're alive.<br>\n<img src=\"http://cache.ohinternet.com/images/1/13/Awesome.png\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"><br>\nPlus by simply asking this, you make me step into the shoes of scum, which you could twist into saying that \"only scum would say that! you're scum!\".
