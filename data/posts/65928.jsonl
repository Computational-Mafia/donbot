If a lynch isn't decided by deadline, no lynch will occur.<br>\n2. You must use <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: Someone</div> or <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Someone</span> to cast a vote. You can unvote by <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Unvote: Someone</div> or <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: Someone</span>. To vote no lynch, use <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: No Lynch</div> or <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: No Lynch</span>.<br>\n3. The hammering vote occurs when a player receives 50%+1 votes or No Lynch is voted for by 50%+1 votes.<br>\n4. When the hammering vote is cast, the game enters twilight. You may continue to talk until the thread is locked, but please note that any votes cast afterwards will not be counted.<br>\n5.

Upon receiving a <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">3rd</div> prod, I will <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">immediately</div> begin searching for a replacement when I prod you. A fourth prod equals an immediate force-replace.<br>\n4. Should I begin searching for a replacement and you return before I find a replacement, you will keep your slot, unless this is your fourth prod.<br>\n5. If a player is force-replaced or modkilled, you will <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">not</div> gain access to the Dead PT.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline-flex;text-decoration:line-through\">6. If I cannot find a replacement in <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">1 week</div> or a single slot is replaced <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">&gt;3</div> times (excluding pre-game), I will be forced to kill the slot. The slot is *not* modkilled however.</div><br>\n7. If a town player is modkilled, the day will end in No Lynch. If a mafia player is modkilled, the day will continue.<br>\n8. Please inform me if you will be V/LA. Do note that unless you can follow regular activity demands, I will <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">not</div> accept a V/LA period <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">longer than 72 hours</div> You will be prodded 12-24 hours after your V/LA period ends.<br>\n9. All prods must be responded to in-thread unless it is night by the time you return, in which case, you must pm me.<br>\n10. Players may request for \"nudges\" before 48 hours have past, and I will nudge the player. Player-requested nudges do not count as prods. I will issue a real prod around 48 hrs of not posting.<br>\n11. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Consequences of not following the rules in section E are not limited to this game.</div></div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">D. <div style=\"font-size: 120%; line-height: normal; display: inline\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Pre-Game</div></div></div><br>\n<div style=\"font-size: 90%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">1.

It looks like trying to to the nice thing, but comes across as 'we're saving that lynch for later' which simply appears scum-motivated to me. This brings us to her <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7802448#p7802448\" class=\"postlink\">#32</a> in which she kind of dispels the above, but doesn't really close the case. Lynching an 'unreadable' player D2 in any case is quite likely either scum-motivated or bad play. How you can suggest that you won't have stronger reads than 'unreadable' D2 doesn't sit well with me, and the whole debacle seemed to ignore the posts so far from APF and RC especially. I'm not getting a massively strong read from this in pre-game since it seems more of a theoretical debate than a serious push on a PL D2 due to the lack of game-specific context throughout, but not only does it appear to me as scum-motivated, I also totally wanted to wade in and give my 2 pennies on Policy Lynches.

The first few days of a standard game are random anyway, and people are reacting to accusations/pre-votes just like they do in RVS.  There's as good a chance as any that an actual vote will happen before deadline because of this.

It looks like trying to to the nice thing, but comes across as 'we're saving that lynch for later' which simply appears scum-motivated to me. This brings us to her #32 in which she kind of dispels the above, but doesn't really close the case. Lynching an 'unreadable' player D2 in any case is quite likely either scum-motivated or bad play. How you can suggest that you won't have stronger reads than 'unreadable' D2 doesn't sit well with me, and the whole debacle seemed to ignore the posts so far from APF and RC especially. I'm not getting a massively strong read from this in pre-game since it seems more of a theoretical debate than a serious push on a PL D2 due to the lack of game-specific context throughout, but not only does it appear to me as scum-motivated, I also totally wanted to wade in and give my 2 pennies on Policy Lynches.

Or will we be getting another 30 or so posts that are variations of \"sorry guys it's just too early for me to be playing serious\"?

Asks questions of wide variety of posters, puts his opinions down on the thread, seems to be genuinely interested in sorting people.  Obviously scum can fake this, but it doesn't feel fake to me.  Town lean.<br>\n<br>\nFA: Obviously a decent number of the posts were just random crap, but there was enough substance in here that I'm feeling good about her right now.  Seems genuinely curious about sorting people, and consistently engages in a variety of discussions with a goal of pushing or sorting people.  Town lean.<br>\n<br>\nAPF: I'm having a hard time sorting him because I can't tell when he's being serious and when he's just BS'ing / reaction testing / lazy (the discussion about <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7802230#p7802230\">29</a> seems misguided in that regard because it felt like intentional BS to me).  It feels like he's been more serious lately.  I still think his reasoning in his vote for me was weak (and the vote / unvote / revote was odd, especially unvoting me because I \"agreed\" with his post on RC), but early votes tend to be on the weak side unless you've got really dumb scum or something.  Null for now but it'd be nice to see a bit more seriousness so that I can actually read him.<br>\n<br>\nRoshar: I'd agree that a decent number of her posts were more theory/mechanics than substance, but I'm not sure that this really stands out in this board (so far).  I'm not going to vote her just because her theory stands at odds with people on the board.  There's also a level of aggression I'm seeing lately that seems towny.  Overall null, with maybe a really small town lean, and I'll +1 on Maverick liking her lately.<br>\n<br>\nRC: I really don't have a sense of him right now.  The temper flare-up around <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7806600#p7806600\">164</a> was odd, but I'm not sure it's AI.  Ditto all the talk about his meta.<br>\n<br>\nNos: Maverick was correct to point out the lack of content in her posts.  Naked voting me as a \"ok here now I'm providing content\" was really weird.  Possibly scummy but seems as likely to just be lazy or reactive than necessarily scummy.

Some people may write it off as a grudge vote which would be a valid assumption as well, but imo he has no useful skills that is worthy keeping around if he is town and if he is scum you definitely want him gone ASAP. This is the guy who double bussed his mafia partners hard and convinced town to lynch a gunsmith clear (or maybe it was a cop) to win the game as scum. he is very manipulative and impossible to read as either alignment. He should absolutely be the lynch today and until I see posts from other people that make me think they may be a better lynch. I like my vote where it is at.

I'm not asking people to not provide information but I am asking them to not provide it in the format of a reads list. People can relay their thoughts on others without making a reads list. List reads give scum info about who they should NK and who they should leave alive to let town mislynch. If you find people scummy you can relay that info without a list read. If you find people town, good for you. Don't share that info unless somebody asks you (which imo nobody should do).

According to you, the down side of providing town reads is that scum can make slightly more informed reads (as opposed to the much more informed reads created by PR hunting).  OTOH, the upside of providing town reads is that it gets people to provide more reasoning in thread, giving scum more chances to get caught BS'ing, and it makes life difficult for scum to have to make scum cases on people they were town reading earlier.<br>\nFrankly, your theory here seems to be really weird.

That's being pretty open. If you don't think I'm scum, why are you focusing so much attention on me? If you think I'm scum, why aren't you voting me? If I'm null then why are you focusing on just me?

If you have stronger scum reads why are you not pressuring them?<br>\n<br>\nI get it, I apparently annoy you for some reason, for what reason I have no idea. I've already done more in this game than most of the other players because I have 2 scum reads and have voted both of them. <br>\n<br>\nYou vote me right after the game started because I made a joke, you wanted to know when I was going to start providing content but the game had just started.

It feels like pulling teeth and it really shouldn't.  I owe him a meta dive (not ASAP but def. by this weekend) to see if he's always super closed, if he often jumps in with \"ok I found the scum guys\" type posts representing theories he hasn't fully thought through or came down on one side and just ignored other plausible explanations.  But my gut is saying that I'll probably see similar behavior from him in either alignment, and that he's just going to live perpetually in the null zone by choice, because that's where he wants to be.<br>\n<br>\nIt's the sort of behavior that IMO makes the game less pleasant, regardless of his alignment.  And there's a post game rant that I'll probably go on about why I dislike this behavior so much.  But if you want me to give you a strong alignment read on him, I can't.  Maybe he'll start to open up and let him be read one way or the other.  I hope he does.  But I suspect he won't, and that further efforts to get much out of him are likely to be fruitless.  Maybe I'll change my mind on that going forward, or maybe someone else will do a better job getting something substantive out of him.  But at least right now, I don't know what to make of his alignment, and I'm not optimistic that I'll get much of a better read any time soon.

Or will we be getting another 30 or so posts that are variations of \"sorry guys it's just too early for me to be playing serious\"?

Asks questions of wide variety of posters, puts his opinions down on the thread, seems to be genuinely interested in sorting people.  Obviously scum can fake this, but it doesn't feel fake to me.  Town lean.<br>\n<br>\nFA: Obviously a decent number of the posts were just random crap, but there was enough substance in here that I'm feeling good about her right now.  Seems genuinely curious about sorting people, and consistently engages in a variety of discussions with a goal of pushing or sorting people.  Town lean.<br>\n<br>\nAPF: I'm having a hard time sorting him because I can't tell when he's being serious and when he's just BS'ing / reaction testing / lazy (the discussion about <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7802230#p7802230\">29</a> seems misguided in that regard because it felt like intentional BS to me).  It feels like he's been more serious lately.  I still think his reasoning in his vote for me was weak (and the vote / unvote / revote was odd, especially unvoting me because I \"agreed\" with his post on RC), but early votes tend to be on the weak side unless you've got really dumb scum or something.  Null for now but it'd be nice to see a bit more seriousness so that I can actually read him.<br>\n<br>\nRoshar: I'd agree that a decent number of her posts were more theory/mechanics than substance, but I'm not sure that this really stands out in this board (so far).  I'm not going to vote her just because her theory stands at odds with people on the board.  There's also a level of aggression I'm seeing lately that seems towny.  Overall null, with maybe a really small town lean, and I'll +1 on Maverick liking her lately.<br>\n<br>\nRC: I really don't have a sense of him right now.  The temper flare-up around <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7806600#p7806600\">164</a> was odd, but I'm not sure it's AI.  Ditto all the talk about his meta.<br>\n<br>\nNos: Maverick was correct to point out the lack of content in her posts.  Naked voting me as a \"ok here now I'm providing content\" was really weird.  Possibly scummy but seems as likely to just be lazy or reactive than necessarily scummy.  Lean scum but largely TBD depending on her content.<br>\n<br>\nClumsy/FL/Kain/Lowell: meh.</div></blockquote><br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7810901#p7810901\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7810901#p7810901\" data-post-id=\"7810901\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 371</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=27591\">mhsmith0</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7810887#p7810887\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7810887#p7810887\" data-post-id=\"7810887\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 368</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=26127\">Nosferatu</a> wrote:</cite>I was exaggerating when I said wall.

It feels like pulling teeth and it really shouldn't.  I owe him a meta dive (not ASAP but def. by this weekend) to see if he's always super closed, if he often jumps in with \"ok I found the scum guys\" type posts representing theories he hasn't fully thought through or came down on one side and just ignored other plausible explanations.  But my gut is saying that I'll probably see similar behavior from him in either alignment, and that he's just going to live perpetually in the null zone by choice, because that's where he wants to be.<br>\n<br>\nIt's the sort of behavior that IMO makes the game less pleasant, regardless of his alignment.  And there's a post game rant that I'll probably go on about why I dislike this behavior so much.  But if you want me to give you a strong alignment read on him, I can't.  Maybe he'll start to open up and let him be read one way or the other.  I hope he does.  But I suspect he won't, and that further efforts to get much out of him are likely to be fruitless.  Maybe I'll change my mind on that going forward, or maybe someone else will do a better job getting something substantive out of him.  But at least right now, I don't know what to make of his alignment, and I'm not optimistic that I'll get much of a better read any time soon.

Let me know if today's events moved the needle at all.<br>\n<br>\nFor my part, I have a town-lean on Jake and don't think we should lynch him. I had a bad feeling about some of the things he said. But most of the arguments against him are based on NAI playstyle issues. There was someone saying something to the effect that he didn't have a case on mhsmith. It's true that he doesn't have a comprehensive 'The Case on Mhsmith' post, but it's not hard to glean from what he's written that he sees mhsmith as having been non-genuine on specific instances. Then there's Maverick's points against him, which I may summarize as follows:<br>\n<br>\n1) Jake said the people pressuring mhsmith were pressuring him so that he'd remove his vote (but Jake didn't say this. He was saying that mhsmith got pressured in general, so then removed his vote in hopes that it would reduce the heat on him).<br>\n2) Jake isn't trying to convince town to lynch his scumread (but he did say why he thought mhsmith was scum, and the degree of subsequent politicking one does for it is a playstyle thing).<br>\n3) Jake was angling for towncred (this might be in the eye of the beholder.

He's basically saying that there was pressure against my argument, as opposed to specifically being pressure against my vote.  There's a logical consistency there, and in fact it represents a plausible read of what happened.<br>\nThe back and forth seems like Maverick found something and jumped on it as much as there truly being anything worth jumping on.  Given that Jake tends to present things in an opaque manner and stonewalls, I don't view maverick's take there as necessarily unreasonable, but it is at least a bit lazy to jump to the \"you're lying\" take on that incident instead of trying to figure out how it might reasonably hold together in his mind.<br>\nThat said, Jake's over the top \"how dare you accuse me of lying you have insulted my honor sir\" bit in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7799078#p7799078\">, [post]604</a>, etc. was ridiculous.

I'm not sure anything between him and FA pinged me as especially notable for AI purposes; I may re-read that later, but that's my first take.  I'm actually starting to lean a little bit town on him.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: Maverick Thoughts</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\">FWIW, some of this is similar to what FL said in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7817481#p7817481\">663</a>.<br>\nLooking specifically at Jake's <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7816268#p7816268\">615</a>, which argued that five of Maverick's accusations were false:<br>\n1 Likely false.  I suppose it's plausible that in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7814778#p7814778\">521</a> Jake was sneaking in that specific wording to try to buy town credit, but it's buried inside of an accusation against me, which makes me think it was more related to the \"why are you annoyed at MOI????\" point (which of course was ridiculous), but his overall game play has been anything but looking for explicit town credit.<br>\n2/3 (related, response to \"You're backtracking with pedantic little arguments that anyone ought to be able to see through\") Likely false.  I say \"likely\" here because there's an opaqueness to Jake's process that both makes him difficult to read AND plausibly gives him the option to go back and say \"no, this is what I meant\".  That said, I don't see any kind of clear evidence of backtracking or a reliance on pedantry.<br>\n4 Debatable.  Jake represented getting worked up specifically about the lying portion more than the accusation.  But it could reasonably be that he simply focused on that bit as part of the \"worked up about you thinking I'm scum\" perspective.<br>\n5 Debatable.  If Jake legitimately thinks that he's being falsely accused of lying, I could buy him getting angry as either alignment.  I could also buy that he's faking it (especially as an easy buy of credibility in case there are other points where he DOES end up lying).  I don't see in-thread evidence that this is clearly true or clearly false.<br>\nJake's defense against the other stuff (\"Willingly ignored a large portion of the game\"; not putting effort into reading others; \"tunnelling... a quite weak argument\") seems to boil down to \"I don't play that way, and you can't tell me how to play\".  I don't like that defense at all, but it doesn't make him scum.<br>\n<br>\nPS There's something specific of Maverick's that I really don't like.  <br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7815318#p7815318\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7815318#p7815318\" data-post-id=\"7815318\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 543</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=27562\">Maverick1102</a> wrote:</cite>I like both the Nos and the JSF Wagons.

Maverick, why did your opinion on this flip between 387 and 543?

So what else changed to make that behavior scummy in your mind?<br>\n<br>\nPS I'd agree that Jake's vote on me is mediocre, but I'm not sure that it's necessarily insincere or vote parking or anything like that.

The questions asking you to explain your reasoning aren't loaded questions. They were an attempt to get to understand your logic and motives. Only somebody who's got something to hide imo would think they were loaded questions. If you answer them truthfully (which I don't feel you have) you have nothing to worry about. <br>\n<br>\nYou have ignored your 2 pregame scum reads. You said pregame was important. Instead of focusing on those people you attack nos for making a mountain out of a molehill? That literally makes no sense. It certainly isn't protown imo. <br>\n<br>\n2. I'm not voting you cause I think somebody else is town. That's just outright untrue. I'm voting you because I think you are likely scum because your actions don't look like they come from a town mindset. I did change my vote because I'm unsure of mhsmith, but I don't think he's town. Not yet anyway. So this fallacy accusation is just plain bulllshit. <br>\n<br>\n3. I wasn't hard tunneling RC and haven't hard tunneled RC. You want to see hard tunneling from me I can show you examples. This isn't close to hard tunneling<br>\n<br>\n4. My pregame refusal to play isn't any sort of fallacy. Now you are really grasping at straws. My refusal to play has nothing to do with anything. Nobody was obligated to do anything but make 1 post. The game doesn't start until it starts so people just wasted their time talking. <br>\n<br>\nNow you want to talk about someone being a hypocrite? I'd say that's you. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\nYou said pregame was important yet you ignore your pregame reads. THAT darling, is an accurate example of being a hypocrite.

It looks like trying to to the nice thing, but comes across as 'we're saving that lynch for later' which simply appears scum-motivated to me. This brings us to her <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7802448#p7802448\" class=\"postlink\">#32</a> in which she kind of dispels the above, but doesn't really close the case. Lynching an 'unreadable' player D2 in any case is quite likely either scum-motivated or bad play. How you can suggest that you won't have stronger reads than 'unreadable' D2 doesn't sit well with me, and the whole debacle seemed to ignore the posts so far from APF and RC especially. I'm not getting a massively strong read from this in pre-game since it seems more of a theoretical debate than a serious push on a PL D2 due to the lack of game-specific context throughout, but not only does it appear to me as scum-motivated, I also totally wanted to wade in and give my 2 pennies on Policy Lynches.

Hilariously defensive with a voteless OMGUS essentially.

How you can suggest that you won't have stronger reads than 'unreadable' D2 doesn't sit well with me, and the whole debacle seemed to ignore the posts so far from APF and RC especially. I'm not getting a massively strong read from this in pre-game since it seems more of a theoretical debate than a serious push on a PL D2 due to the lack of game-specific context throughout, but not only does it appear to me as scum-motivated, I also totally wanted to wade in and give my 2 pennies on Policy Lynches.

I know it's after a long conversation so there's context but it's presenting contentious assertions as fact.<br>\n<br>\nMaverick doesn't know why Jake lied about applying pressure on smith. Maverick's categorisation of Jake's arguments as pedantic is subjective. Similarly, \"hunted for towncred\" is an interpretation of Jake's actions as scummy, rather than presenting the actions themselves. Maverick quoted the posts he's referring to but it's presented objectively in this post. Maverick doesn't know why Jake is angry.<br>\n<br>\nJake has presented conflicting motivations in thread. He said pregame was useless (<a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7807095#p7807095\" class=\"postlink\">post 198</a>) and that he was busy (<a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7807361#p7807361\" class=\"postlink\">post 201</a>) and then when he was called on saying the thread was useless (<a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7809163#p7809163\" class=\"postlink\">post 272</a>) he said it was because he's busy and didn't acknowledge the actual foundation for the comment (<a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7809151#p7809151\" class=\"postlink\">post 269</a>.)<br>\n<br>\nSimilarly, he posted a vote for RC (<a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7809965#p7809965\" class=\"postlink\">post 340</a>) and a subsequent explanation (<a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7811745#p7811745\" class=\"postlink\">post 427</a>) which doesn't mention any posts in the game. Then (<a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7812419#p7812419\" class=\"postlink\">post 460</a>) says that he's also read some things in the game which make him think RC is scum. (I can't see any reference to what those posts are but that's a different thing.) Then, when Nos says it's a policy lynch (<a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7812469#p7812469\" class=\"postlink\">post 462</a>, Nosferatu\"],) Jake only quotes his post saying that he has read some of RC's content (<a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7812564#p7812564\" class=\"postlink\">post 468</a>.)<br>\n<br>\nThis is the kind of thing that comes across as lying in the thread.<br>\n<br>\nI don't know what lying Maverick is referring to about smith, maybe I missed it. Maverick, can you confirm?<br>\n<br>\nI'd also still like to know if Jake's vote on RC was serious or if it was part of gambit.

It looks like trying to to the nice thing, but comes across as 'we're saving that lynch for later' which simply appears scum-motivated to me. This brings us to her #32 in which she kind of dispels the above, but doesn't really close the case. Lynching an 'unreadable' player D2 in any case is quite likely either scum-motivated or bad play. How you can suggest that you won't have stronger reads than 'unreadable' D2 doesn't sit well with me, and the whole debacle seemed to ignore the posts so far from APF and RC especially. I'm not getting a massively strong read from this in pre-game since it seems more of a theoretical debate than a serious push on a PL D2 due to the lack of game-specific context throughout, but not only does it appear to me as scum-motivated, I also totally wanted to wade in and give my 2 pennies on Policy Lynches.

If so, to what end?<br>\n<br>\nI'm not a massive fan of APF's <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7802230#p7802230\" class=\"postlink\">#29</a> It's very forced and reactionary which simply doesn't need to be the case on page two in pre-game. Hilariously defensive with a voteless OMGUS essentially. Roshar summed it up pretty well in the next post with this, which was my thoughts pretty much upon reading. <blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7802298#p7802298\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7802298#p7802298\" data-post-id=\"7802298\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 30</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=24686\">Roshar</a> wrote:</cite><br>\nBut you're hard-defending.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nWhat I don't like about Roshar's thoughts on Policy lynches isn't that she disagrees with them, (I disagree with the concept of Policy lynches anyway) but that she wouldn't policy lynch straight away, she'd save them for D2 'in case we have no leads'. It looks like trying to to the nice thing, but comes across as 'we're saving that lynch for later' which simply appears scum-motivated to me. This brings us to her <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7802448#p7802448\" class=\"postlink\">#32</a> in which she kind of dispels the above, but doesn't really close the case. Lynching an 'unreadable' player D2 in any case is quite likely either scum-motivated or bad play. How you can suggest that you won't have stronger reads than 'unreadable' D2 doesn't sit well with me, and the whole debacle seemed to ignore the posts so far from APF and RC especially. I'm not getting a massively strong read from this in pre-game since it seems more of a theoretical debate than a serious push on a PL D2 due to the lack of game-specific context throughout, but not only does it appear to me as scum-motivated, I also totally wanted to wade in and give my 2 pennies on Policy Lynches.

So you think mhs is scum and wanna bring out his scum buddies? With frozen as well? In that case 1) you'd have ruined your plan 2) I totally don't think you were doing that.<br>\n578 -  the Nos defending isn't helping Nos imo.<br>\nThe argument of Maverick and Jake about lying though seems to be semantics. Jake is saying that he didn't lie because he meant mhs INDIRECTLY got pressured to switch his vote, wheras he thinks Maverick meant directly pressured. <br>\n<br>\nNos's<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7816228#p7816228\"> 607</a> pings me so so bad.

It's way more ballsy but looking at the way things turned out, and the likelihood that people will interpret it as TvT, it could be worth it. I think Jake's pregame play shows a player who isn't afraid of having attention, whether that indicates scum-Jake or town-Jake, I don't know, but I don't think scum will necessarily avoid the argument. I think mhsmith mentioned that Jake seemed to be getting panicky and I agree. I think the aggressive behaviour can be a response to being pushed, as well as backing off.

I think VCA can help but most likely when it's compared with what a player's been saying or their attitudes towards the wagons in the game. There's so many possible patterns of scum behaviour that starting from that side is pretty difficult.<br>\n<br>\nI think it's relevant that there weren't very many other options yesterday apart from Max although I guess Lowell was the counterwagon. A lot of the votes on Max in D2 were the same as D1. It's possible that scum saw/understood the pressure on Max, and the willingness to lynch him, and saw that they didn't need to do anything to try to get a mislynch.<br>\n<br>\nThat makes me recontextualise Lowell's push on Roshar, FA_Q2's questioning of Titus and APF's vote on FA_Q2. I'd also say that Johnny and Titus' behaviour in D2 fits this description of possible scum play from reading D2 in this context. Garmr came in and talked about APF but it was a little late in the day (because of the replacement, totally null) to be considered for this point.<br>\n<br>\nAlso, to continue rabbiting on about the neighbour speculation - this was discussion that wouldn't actually lead to a lynch or present another option apart from Max. So it's totally free for scum to discuss without worrying about derailing a mislynch. I'm not saying it's AI (Max talked about it as well, so obviously) but that's another point.<br>\n<br>\nAbout Lowell's Roshar push - he voted for Max, Max called him out, then Lowell pushed Roshar. Considering the pressure on Max, I think it's an unlikely scum play to move onto Roshar.

The second quote comes from the post where I followed up on all my reads, not just that one, after checking back on stuff, reading some ISOs, and looking at the wagons. Your jumping between the wagons was one of the things that put me off them. In fact, at the time of my post you were on neither of them.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nYou're saying you found Clumsy suspicious on your first read. Then after you started looking at individual players and wagons, you started backing away. That is exactly what I just described. After looking at the wagon, and realizing you were late, you backed away. <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Yes. And I did. So?</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nAgain, you say you don't like Max's posting but based on the wagon (me), you back off again. <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Nope. The reluctance was me not wanting to join either of the two wagons which you were pushing when I had a strong read on you and only weak reads on them. I did not refuse to vote so don't try to pretend that I did.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nYou refused to vote until the last day. And how convenient to try to avoid both lynches using wagons as the reason. \"I don't like Clumsy's wagon\" and \"My main scum read is on Max' wagon, my hands are tied\".<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>It's not uncommon for wagons to switch late in the Day, especially when the existing wagons feel like a compromise, which was the impression I had here. I already had a slight town read on Clumsy and your attacks on Jake had made me less eager to vote that slot. There were a few people willing to consider Lowell, if not you, so I thought it worth a chance. Unfortunately, hardly anyone was willing to move.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><br>\nI was only in the game for half of Day one and a lot of that time was spent catching up. It was not the final hours of the day, but a few days earlier that I expressed doubts over the Clumsy wagon, and my exchanges with you should have made you aware that I wasn't too keen on the other one either. I find it disingenuous that you are ignoring this.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\n Had your performance <div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">after you caught up</div> in the day been any different, I would have considered it. But you barely pushed any reads. Your scum read on me for instance. It was me who pushed you to make a case. Otherwise you would have been more than happy to keep it at, \"gut read\" and \"voting players based on playstyle\". You give out reads without explanation, with promises of going back/ISOing to see what made you feel that way. And at this point I think it's a pretense. The only read you tried to explain, you didn't bother pushing, then you come out end of D1 trying to divert the lynches, something that was so obviously impossible to do. It's so obvious to me that your motive wasn't in trying to divert the lynch. Your motive was to express your reluctance to go with max.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><br>\nDidn't you read the dialogue between Max and I?

Several times, actually. And I still don't see how he became your number 1 scum read. Why are you providing it as a reason that because I moved down your list, it made Max more scummy?

She's so adverse to lynching Max, that she's willing to have a flash lynch on....Lowell. With less than 24 hrs left.

And when you understand the futility of the situation (20 hrs 'till end of day), you're willing to lynch suspicious reads, even if they're not the strongest.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nRegards to your second point, do you think Huntress displayed apathy? Do you think her choosing the two most active posters as scum reads (you and I) shows apathy? Do you think her stating her willingness to stay all day next to her computer to divert the lynch shows apathy? I'd say she's quite invested.<br>\n<br>\nAnd in terms of the last quote, it's obviously my interpretation, based on what she said, (\"I'm not liking that wagon\") of why Huntress decided to change her read on Clumsy. I.e, she liked his wagon much better when it was L-3 (when she first gave out the scum read), than when it was L-5. She didn't want to be the one who put him at L-1. Forgive me for not adding, \"In my opinion\"<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GbxFLA62Bc\" class=\"postlink\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GbxFLA62Bc</a><br>\n<br>\nAnd I'm talking mainly about the D1 wagons.

I'm mainly referring to the fact:   <br>\n1)She was on his list of people he was not okay lynching D2<br>\n2) That he thinks people voting him are, \"opportunistic as hell\". Yet, when Huntress was apparently willing to divert two L-5 lynches on him D1, he didn't comment.", "time": "Thu May 05, 2016 5:01 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=65928&start=1575", "forum": "53", "thread": "65928"}

I'm still highly suspicious of FAQ. His posts the past couple days give me scum vibes, and his vote on Titus smells like a bus.<br>\n<br>\nTitus has also been independently scummy so far. Her scumhunting has been very objective (lynching Max for information, and now lynching a couple of players that were rather lazy D1). The thing with these objective pushes is that they're very safe in that they adhere to an external methodology. When you're critical of them you're more likely to grapple with the theory of the scumhunting, whereas when you're critical of something more subjective you're inclined to think of what ulterior motives could be behind it.<br>\n<br>\nNow, I don't think scum!Titus deliberately thought through all that, but I do think she might've instinctively/unconsciously seized upon this manner of scumhunting because of the safety of it. And the fact that it's D3 and the scum only need two mislynches makes me uncomfortable to follow her when she's identified two easy targets.<br>\n<br>\nSo my top two scumreads right now are FAQ and Titus.

Does anyone think <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7895949#p7895949\">1579</a> and 1580 were genuine?<br>\n<br>\nI also didn't like Roshar's overreaction to Froot Loop's point about the neighbour discussion and the assumption that it was aimed purely at her.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nRe: Lowell<br>\n<br>\nDay one it was mainly the fact that he was so brazen about wanting to rush the end of the Day, and his voting patterns, which  Nos brought up in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7841296#p7841296\">1094</a>. Day two it was the way he said to blame him for the mislynch, and for that post about Roshar. Another thing I noticed but didn't mention was the feeling that he might have been trying to buddy up to me.

She's explicit on this with \"It's done by both town and scum\" and \"Can go both ways though\"<br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7815656#p7815656\">574</a>: she's not attacking him for playstyle so much as she's accusing him of lying, explicitly pointing out that if it were the case he'd have defeated his purpose by admitting to trying to draw out buddies.<br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7816268#p7816268\">615</a>: I can potentially see Huntress's point here.<br>\nSo i can see a bit of AI reading playstyle, but 891 felt more like the drivers of the read are the 476 quick vote after FA's 475, and her comment about Jake's \"1-dimensional view of how town would have thought\", and her\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>\nAlso, jake's stance on having not cared about pre-game, then voting for RC on start of D1 with a policy lynch reason, that later changes to some posts he found scummy (posts he didn't bother quoting and posts that came from pre-game) is all over the place. Feels like he's making up things as he goes. And his push on mhs doesn't resonate with me. \n</div></blockquote>\nSo while there's some play-style shade thrown, it's not the fundamental driver.  I'd also note that in that post there are some specific times where she seemingly goes out of her way to talk about stuff that could be play-style things that are null \"Vindictive. Anti-town. Not necessarily scummy.\" etc.<br>\nI will say it's a bit weird to have an intent to hammer post when some of the post was actively defending stuff of his as null, but that may be a playstyle thing.<br>\n<br>\n2) Other <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7851684#p7851684\">1171</a> stuff:<br>\nMax and timing - yeah I'd agree w/ Huntress's point that the analysis came later<br>\nfinding fault rather than wolves: maybe.  Did that meta read ever come up?<br>\nMax was basically accusing Huntress of non-participation, which is more of a mafia-aligned behavior.  Whether said accusation is fair is a different story, but that was the accusation.  As far as town reads go, that's putting information into thread, and I'd think that's generally a good thing.<br>\n<br>\n3) <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7854037#p7854037\">1198</a>:<br>\n574 - I think Jake has been sufficiently opaque and unclear in his wording of things in general that I don't particularly have a problem with either Roshar's or Huntress's side of reading what he was up to.  Even re-reading that post I don't know what he was trying to say, so... *shrugs*<br>\n615 - I agree with Huntress here.<br>\n521 - I largely agree with Huntress here.  I do think it's reasonable to attack jake's self-defense there, but I'd otherwise agree that it seemed like Jake was trying to sort me out there.<br>\n<br>\n4) <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7854941#p7854941\">1209</a>: <br>\nI'm fine w/ Huntress on the Jake points.  Ditto the vote timing.<br>\n<br>\n5) Nos's responses:<br>\nNos <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7841931#p7841931\">1105</a> - I'm a bit sympathetic to both sides here.  It's difficult for everyone else to read Nos if she isn't being open about her thought process and engagement, and Nos has a playstyle she likes and seems to think is effective.  Meh on my end here.<br>\nNos <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7842001#p7842001\">1106</a> - I enjoyed Nos's rebuttal here.  OTOH, Roshar's point seems reasonable to me.  Nos said she'd move it when something else pinged her, 28 pages later, nothing pinged her, and she wasn't really pushing me either.  I get that it can potentially be a playstyle thing, but it seems weird IMO.  I think it's fair to push on it.<br>\n<br>\n6) Day 2 - I was fine w/ Roshar's stuff on D2 as well (after mulling it over anyway)<br>\n<br>\n7) <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7894516#p7894516\">1554</a><br>\nI find Huntress's explanations here plausible.  Roshar's attribution of wolf motivation is reachy, although not an unreasonable explanation for what happened.  But there is entirely reasonable town motivation for what happened too.  This is IMO null behavior on Huntress's end.<br>\n<br>\n8) <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7895869#p7895869\">1577</a><br>\nI feel fine with Huntress's responses here too.<br>\n<br>\n9) <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7895948#p7895948\">1578</a><br>\nMeh.  It's a narrative, and yes, it COULD be the truth.  But it feels like conf!bias fitting Huntress's actions into the story that Roshar already believes, as opposed to truly having found anything damning (or being something that Roshar was completely making up).<br>\nI'd also note that there is plenty of time to shift wagons EOD.  EOD1 was 8:45 PM EST, something like 6 hours after the actual hammer (which itself was about 3 hours after Huntress pushed out Roshar and Lowell as alternatives), which is plenty of time for people to show up and move things around.  <br>\n1579-80... yeah, I do think it's plausibly genuine.  In my mind, Roshar fits a model of aggressive newb!town, which is why I'm town-reading her even with some stuff that feels reachy in my book.<br>\n<br>\n10) Overall: I think Huntress's case on Roshar is a LOT less strong than Huntress seems to think it is, but I can see this as a legitimate thought progression, and I'm increasingly inclined to think the reverse is true as well.  If someone wants to try and re-sell these wagons to me, I guess I'll listen, but right now <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"font-size: 200%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">I ACTIVELY OPPOSE BOTH OF THESE WAGONS</div></div>.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nSo what's a better wagon then?

In practice, Roleblockers are more likely to stop Town power roles from working early on, but as the game goes on Roleblockers become much more powerful. In particular, when there is one Mafioso left Roleblockers can be used to confirm players - if the Mafia's kill goes through, whoever was blocked that Night isn't the last Mafioso. Inversely, if a Roleblocker blocks someone and the Mafia's kill disappears, there is a decent chance that the Roleblocker blocked the scum who was performing the kill (though this is not necessarily the case, given that other power roles may have had a hand in it, or the scum decided to not kill anyone as a framing gambit). In summary, Town Roleblockers are almost liabilities early on but become much stronger if they survive to lategame, so they have net positive value for Town.</div></blockquote>", "time": "Sun May 08, 2016 1:06 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=65928&start=1650", "forum": "53", "thread": "65928"}

I had a look through Shaddowez' ISO and nothing jumped out at me. <br>\n<br>\nI also had a look at Huntress' ISO to see if there's anything interesting. Some notes:<br>\n- Her initial scumreads were me, Roshar and Clumsy. I believe Roshar's town, so this is a totally town pool (bearing in mind that I know I'm town.) This might have some bearing on her subsequent pool (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7882267#p7882267\">1464</a>.) Again, we've got Max and Roshar (town) but also Lowell and APF. She also subsequently speculated about Lowell and APF being scumpartners (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7898791#p7898791\">1597</a>.)<br>\n- I remember thinking at the time that her questioning of Titus' VC post was weird and unnecessary. Now it can be viewed as fabricated content but it's an interesting choice.<br>\n- I searched her ISO for Johnny and there's basically nothing. Johnny asked her about when she was going to post and she said she watched him on N1. From a search, there's also nothing on the Shaddowez/Gamr slot.<br>\n- She posted positively about FA_Q2's play (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7896883#p7896883\">1586</a>) when asked, but similarly about mhsmith, so this isn't indicative for me either way.<br>\n<br>\nSo, Huntress posted an all-town lynchpool and she stated strong scum reads on Roshar and Max, town players. I think this indicates that she's likely to avoid her scum partners in-thread. This puts Lowell and APF in a better light for me. Her questioning of Titus is odd and I think it's possible that this was designed to allow her to question another player safely when she was under a bit of pressure from Roshar.<br>\n<br>\nAlso, this point:<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7909237#p7909237\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7909237#p7909237\" data-post-id=\"7909237\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 1684</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=27591\">mhsmith0</a> wrote:</cite>\nProbably Titus's move onto Huntress after Roshar's push deserves the most scrutiny, given the claimed NK block and the plausible outcome that Huntress had been caught by a PR.</div></blockquote>\n\nWe need to remember that throughout D3, scum would have known that Huntress had been caught.

I'd also say that Johnny and Titus' behaviour in D2 fits this description of possible scum play from reading D2 in this context. Garmr came in and talked about APF but it was a little late in the day (because of the replacement, totally null) to be considered for this point.<br>\n<br>\nAlso, to continue rabbiting on about the neighbour speculation - this was discussion that wouldn't actually lead to a lynch or present another option apart from Max. So it's totally free for scum to discuss without worrying about derailing a mislynch. I'm not saying it's AI (Max talked about it as well, so obviously) but that's another point.<br>\n<br>\nAbout Lowell's Roshar push - he voted for Max, Max called him out, then Lowell pushed Roshar.

Two reasons. 1) It came first thing D3, right after the announcement of the no NK. 2) His reasons were those from D2, which he directly quoted when he was asked. Almost feels like an effort to quickly settle on a vote before a possible role blocker appeared.<br>\n<br>\n@APF I would not mind lynching Heur today. I'm considering he may be partners with Titus.

I do not believe she believes her reasons for voting Lowell. I wanted to wait a bit before changing my mind on Lowell and voting Titus to see if she was going to vote Lowell as well. And she did. And I think it was a predictable move, if Titus is scum. He's (lowell) an easy vote, and his D3 actions can be way too easily presented as scum motivated. This makes me more and more confident that he's not scum. What's the most important thing that all scum need to do? Blend in. Would they scum-read a PR to fish for a claim and town read their scum buddy, and make themselves look terrible D4? No.  This makes absolutely no sense. The fact that Titus is pushing this superficial read is solidifying my scum read on her. <br>\n<br>\n@Johnny, The titus wagon comprises of Froot and I (excluding FaQ). When did I push you?  And where did Froot push you? The reasons we're voting Titus have little to do with finding her intimidating. There has been a long back and forth between froot and titus. Did you form an opinion on any of it?<br>\n<br>\n@Titus, you said you thought scum would have voted Huntress quickly after my claim and without questioning it b/c they would have known it was correct.

Read through rosh's ISO and note every single time that he mentions huntress prior to post 1508 (the Max lynch).  Universally rosh mentioned that huntress is a low posting slot that he cannot get a goo dread on.  There are multiple pushes for more content from the slot itself and even one post that I would consider soft defending the slot itself in 1417.  Going into day 3 there is little to zero indication that rosh has a hard scum read through day 2.  Right in the beginning of day 3 though rosh pushes huntress immediately.  If I were scum that just had a failed kill that would ping my radar rather hard.<br>\n<br>\nNow, that does not mean that they would necessarily KNOW that rosh was the one that blocked the kill (and it could have even been a doctor) so I think that they would likely try and draw a claim out.  This is a bit of WIFOM though - we cannot necessarily fret out what scum was actually thinking but it is a solid theory that scum had strong suspicions of rosh.", "time": "Mon May 23, 2016 1:08 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=65928&start=1800", "forum": "53", "thread": "65928"}

To follow this pattern, there could be another every-night role and then an odd/even night power which counteracts it. We've got an odd and an even role so that'd imply two every-night roles for the scum? Although their kill could also count as a power which both smith and Roshar's roles counteract. This doesn't really get us anywhere but it's another way of thinking about the distribution of roles.<br>\n<br>\nAlso, we've had two PRs killed. Ircher said there's no N0 ability, so maybe this is an odd-day role? Or scum have some information about roles in the game.<br>\n<br>\nI've got to say, I'm super happy about Titus' lurking earlier today, avoiding questions and now claiming with ~20 hours to go.

But yeah, having a JK in the game raises the questions APF mentions. <br>\n<br>\nHaving said that, Nos was the only investigative role we've seen so far, which makes it pretty powerful in this game. Also, the only role we've seen that was every night. If there's another role, like Titus', then scum have no chance of blocking both PRs in a night. AND with the RB as well, it's possible both will go through. Does that seem too town-sided?<br>\n<br>\nWe can get more information about this with a claim as well. I'm not saying at the moment it's necessary, but if it's a large contributing factor, it would help us to find out if there's any other role which was meant, or could, interact with the JK. I don't know about claiming.

I wanted to force her not to NK me. This meant I'd be protected, if titus was scum, or if someone else was. The one thing I didn't consider was that she'd opt for a no kill, and I'm lucky I decided on blocking her in the end.
