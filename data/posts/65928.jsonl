You can unvote by <span class=\"noboldsig\">Unvote: Someone</span> or <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: Someone</span>. To vote no lynch, use <span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: No Lynch</span> or <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: No Lynch</span>.<br>3. The hammering vote occurs when a player receives 50%+1 votes or No Lynch is voted for by 50%+1 votes.<br>4. When the hammering vote is cast, the game enters twilight. You may continue to talk until the thread is locked, but please note that any votes cast afterwards will not be counted.<br>5.

Upon receiving a <span class=\"noboldsig\">3rd</span> prod, I will <span style=\"font-style: italic\">immediately</span> begin searching for a replacement when I prod you. A fourth prod equals an immediate force-replace.<br>4. Should I begin searching for a replacement and you return before I find a replacement, you will keep your slot, unless this is your fourth prod.<br>5. If a player is force-replaced or modkilled, you will <span class=\"noboldsig\">not</span> gain access to the Dead PT.<br><strike>6. If I cannot find a replacement in <span class=\"noboldsig\">1 week</span> or a single slot is replaced <span class=\"noboldsig\">&gt;3</span> times (excluding pre-game), I will be forced to kill the slot. The slot is *not* modkilled however.</strike><br>7. If a town player is modkilled, the day will end in No Lynch. If a mafia player is modkilled, the day will continue.<br>8. Please inform me if you will be V/LA. Do note that unless you can follow regular activity demands, I will <span class=\"noboldsig\">not</span> accept a V/LA period <span class=\"noboldsig\">longer than 72 hours</span> You will be prodded 12-24 hours after your V/LA period ends.<br>9. All prods must be responded to in-thread unless it is night by the time you return, in which case, you must pm me.<br>10. Players may request for \"nudges\" before 48 hours have past, and I will nudge the player. Player-requested nudges do not count as prods. I will issue a real prod around 48 hrs of not posting.<br>11. <span class=\"noboldsig\">Consequences of not following the rules in section E are not limited to this game.</span></span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">D. <span style=\"font-size: 120%; line-height: 116%;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Pre-Game</span></span></span><br><span style=\"font-size: 90%; line-height: 116%;\">1.

If you don't pick up your role pm within 36 hours, I will begin searching for a replacement.<br>3. All private topics will be open during pre-game.<br>4. The thread will be open during pre-game. <span class=\"noboldsig\">You must confirm both by pm'ing me your role and alignment (<span style=\"font-style: italic\">Do this first!</span>) AND by confirming in-thread.</span> If you have confirmed your role to me, then you will be prodded if you don't post at least once during pre-game.<br>5.

Outside communication outside of the means I provide is prohibited.<br>7. Do not directly quote your role pm. I will use my best discretion here on what's acceptable and what's not.

I will also try to fix any formatting errors you may make, <span class=\"noboldsig\">with the exception of voting tags.</span><br>10. <span class=\"noboldsig\">Rules E.1-E.9 are global rules. This list is not exhaustive, and you are expected to follow all globals rules at this site regardless if it's explicitlyi in the ruleset.</span><br>11.

It's acceptable in readlists, but do not try to impersonate me by using the color.<br>12. Any changes made to this ruleset during the game will be noted at the next VC I post.<br>13. Have fun! And if you have a question, or if something suspicious is going on, feel free to ask me!<br>14. <span class=\"noboldsig\">Exploiting holes in the rules and intentionally faking to break the rules will lead to worse consequences than actually breaking the rule. This includes testing the limits of the rules.</span><br>15. <span class=\"noboldsig\">Once you are dead, you may only post in the dead PT. No bah! posts allowed.</span><br>16. Natural action resolution will be used in this setup. If 2 JK's target each other, the one who sends in the night pm first will take precedence. If a RB and a JK target each other, the RB takes precedence.<br>17. <span class=\"noboldsig\">Mafia cannot kill and use their night action at the same time.</span><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">18. <span class=\"noboldsig\">Rule additions since the start of the game have been underlined.</span></span></span></span></span><br><br>A sample of the VT role pm is shown below:<br><div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: Vanilla Townie</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display: none;\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Welcome, <span style=\"font-style: italic\">Player</span>, to Mini <span style=\"font-style: italic\">0</span>!</span><br>You are a <span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: green\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Vanilla Townie</span></span></span><br><br>While alive, you may vote and persuade people to join your cause.

Hilariously defensive with a voteless OMGUS essentially. Roshar summed it up pretty well in the next post with this, which was my thoughts pretty much upon reading. <blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7802298#p7802298\" class=\"postlink\">post 30</a>, Roshar wrote:</cite>But you're hard-defending.<br></div></blockquote><br><br>What I don't like about Roshar's thoughts on Policy lynches isn't that she disagrees with them, (I disagree with the concept of Policy lynches anyway) but that she wouldn't policy lynch straight away, she'd save them for D2 'in case we have no leads'. It looks like trying to to the nice thing, but comes across as 'we're saving that lynch for later' which simply appears scum-motivated to me. This brings us to her <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7802448#p7802448\" class=\"postlink\">#32</a> in which she kind of dispels the above, but doesn't really close the case. Lynching an 'unreadable' player D2 in any case is quite likely either scum-motivated or bad play. How you can suggest that you won't have stronger reads than 'unreadable' D2 doesn't sit well with me, and the whole debacle seemed to ignore the posts so far from APF and RC especially. I'm not getting a massively strong read from this in pre-game since it seems more of a theoretical debate than a serious push on a PL D2 due to the lack of game-specific context throughout, but not only does it appear to me as scum-motivated, I also totally wanted to wade in and give my 2 pennies on Policy Lynches.

I don't like it either and players trying to call the game early especially in such a manner as APF did irritates me, but it just seems very forced and aloof to me.<br><br>So far, I don't like Roshar's play - it looks the most scum-motivated of the bunch and so I'll <span class=\"noboldsig\">Pre-Game FOS: Roshar</span>.

It looks like trying to to the nice thing, but comes across as 'we're saving that lynch for later' which simply appears scum-motivated to me. This brings us to her #32 in which she kind of dispels the above, but doesn't really close the case. Lynching an 'unreadable' player D2 in any case is quite likely either scum-motivated or bad play. How you can suggest that you won't have stronger reads than 'unreadable' D2 doesn't sit well with me, and the whole debacle seemed to ignore the posts so far from APF and RC especially. I'm not getting a massively strong read from this in pre-game since it seems more of a theoretical debate than a serious push on a PL D2 due to the lack of game-specific context throughout, but not only does it appear to me as scum-motivated, I also totally wanted to wade in and give my 2 pennies on Policy Lynches.

I make you laugh?</div></blockquote><br><br>Do you happen to have an estimate for when you're going to start playing?  Or will we be getting another 30 or so posts that are variations of \"sorry guys it's just too early for me to be playing serious\"?  At least our other high-volume posters are mixing in content with the silliness.  Will this help motivate you to start playing?<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Jake from state farm</span><br><br>More seriously, this is a LOT of posts to basically not be providing any actual content.  If it's a scum plan to just look busy, it's a bad one because of how obviously ineffective it is, but sometimes scum simply don't have anything to say so they continue to speak without saying anything.<br><br><br>Other early reads:<br><br>Maverick: seems to be taking the game seriously.  Asks questions of wide variety of posters, puts his opinions down on the thread, seems to be genuinely interested in sorting people.  Obviously scum can fake this, but it doesn't feel fake to me.  Town lean.<br><br>FA: Obviously a decent number of the posts were just random crap, but there was enough substance in here that I'm feeling good about her right now.  Seems genuinely curious about sorting people, and consistently engages in a variety of discussions with a goal of pushing or sorting people.  Town lean.<br><br>APF: I'm having a hard time sorting him because I can't tell when he's being serious and when he's just BS'ing / reaction testing / lazy (the discussion about <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7802230#p7802230\">29</a> seems misguided in that regard because it felt like intentional BS to me).  It feels like he's been more serious lately.  I still think his reasoning in his vote for me was weak (and the vote / unvote / revote was odd, especially unvoting me because I \"agreed\" with his post on RC), but early votes tend to be on the weak side unless you've got really dumb scum or something.  Null for now but it'd be nice to see a bit more seriousness so that I can actually read him.<br><br>Roshar: I'd agree that a decent number of her posts were more theory/mechanics than substance, but I'm not sure that this really stands out in this board (so far).  I'm not going to vote her just because her theory stands at odds with people on the board.  There's also a level of aggression I'm seeing lately that seems towny.  Overall null, with maybe a really small town lean, and I'll +1 on Maverick liking her lately.<br><br>RC: I really don't have a sense of him right now.  The temper flare-up around <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7806600#p7806600\">164</a> was odd, but I'm not sure it's AI.  Ditto all the talk about his meta.<br><br>Nos: Maverick was correct to point out the lack of content in her posts.  Naked voting me as a \"ok here now I'm providing content\" was really weird.  Possibly scummy but seems as likely to just be lazy or reactive than necessarily scummy.  Lean scum but largely TBD depending on her content.<br><br>Clumsy/FL/Kain/Lowell: meh."}

It was how I planned to start the game as soon as I saw RC was playing but everything in that statement is true based on my experiences which makes my vote serious. Some people may write it off as a grudge vote which would be a valid assumption as well, but imo he has no useful skills that is worthy keeping around if he is town and if he is scum you definitely want him gone ASAP. This is the guy who double bussed his mafia partners hard and convinced town to lynch a gunsmith clear (or maybe it was a cop) to win the game as scum. he is very manipulative and impossible to read as either alignment. He should absolutely be the lynch today and until I see posts from other people that make me think they may be a better lynch. I like my vote where it is at. I don't really think anything said pre-game is going to change my mind but if you disagree please feel free to provide me links or quotes of posts I should consider. <br><br>I won't ignore any case that is made on somebody, so if somebody wants to actually make one to convince me to change my vote I'll be here waiting with baited breath."}

It's anti-town (and IMO obnoxious) behavior, but it can come from either alignment (which is part of what makes it so annoying).

I'm not really sure why.  As town, I want to be able to gain an informed opinion of you rather than just having your obnoxious behavior pinging my scum-dar.  I want to have strong reason to correctly read you, rather than making a limited gut read based on a specific set of anti-town behaviors.<br><br>Or to put it another way: as town, I want to solve the mystery that the game is presenting.  Behavior that makes this task more difficult makes the game more unpleasant to play.<br><br>PPS The full paragraph from your quote was (underlined was your exceprt):<br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>4.

It reads far more like a generic \"oh yeah I read some stuff but not all of it\" than anything specifically pointing to RC's posting as the basis for a scum read, or that you'd specifically been paying attention to his posts.

Maybe he'll start to open up and let him be read one way or the other.  I hope he does.  But I suspect he won't, and that further efforts to get much out of him are likely to be fruitless.  Maybe I'll change my mind on that going forward, or maybe someone else will do a better job getting something substantive out of him.

Or will we be getting another 30 or so posts that are variations of \"sorry guys it's just too early for me to be playing serious\"?

Asks questions of wide variety of posters, puts his opinions down on the thread, seems to be genuinely interested in sorting people.  Obviously scum can fake this, but it doesn't feel fake to me.  Town lean.<br><br>FA: Obviously a decent number of the posts were just random crap, but there was enough substance in here that I'm feeling good about her right now.  Seems genuinely curious about sorting people, and consistently engages in a variety of discussions with a goal of pushing or sorting people.  Town lean.<br><br>APF: I'm having a hard time sorting him because I can't tell when he's being serious and when he's just BS'ing / reaction testing / lazy (the discussion about <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7802230#p7802230\">29</a> seems misguided in that regard because it felt like intentional BS to me).  It feels like he's been more serious lately.  I still think his reasoning in his vote for me was weak (and the vote / unvote / revote was odd, especially unvoting me because I \"agreed\" with his post on RC), but early votes tend to be on the weak side unless you've got really dumb scum or something.  Null for now but it'd be nice to see a bit more seriousness so that I can actually read him.<br><br>Roshar: I'd agree that a decent number of her posts were more theory/mechanics than substance, but I'm not sure that this really stands out in this board (so far).  I'm not going to vote her just because her theory stands at odds with people on the board.  There's also a level of aggression I'm seeing lately that seems towny.  Overall null, with maybe a really small town lean, and I'll +1 on Maverick liking her lately.<br><br>RC: I really don't have a sense of him right now.  The temper flare-up around <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7806600#p7806600\">164</a> was odd, but I'm not sure it's AI.  Ditto all the talk about his meta.<br><br>Nos: Maverick was correct to point out the lack of content in her posts.  Naked voting me as a \"ok here now I'm providing content\" was really weird.  Possibly scummy but seems as likely to just be lazy or reactive than necessarily scummy.

But most of the arguments against him are based on NAI playstyle issues. There was someone saying something to the effect that he didn't have a case on mhsmith. It's true that he doesn't have a comprehensive 'The Case on Mhsmith' post, but it's not hard to glean from what he's written that he sees mhsmith as having been non-genuine on specific instances. Then there's Maverick's points against him, which I may summarize as follows:<br><br>1) Jake said the people pressuring mhsmith were pressuring him so that he'd remove his vote (but Jake didn't say this. He was saying that mhsmith got pressured in general, so then removed his vote in hopes that it would reduce the heat on him).<br>2) Jake isn't trying to convince town to lynch his scumread (but he did say why he thought mhsmith was scum, and the degree of subsequent politicking one does for it is a playstyle thing).<br>3) Jake was angling for towncred (this might be in the eye of the beholder. I didn't really interpret anything he said like this)."}

Maverick's categorisation of Jake's arguments as pedantic is subjective. Similarly, \"hunted for towncred\" is an interpretation of Jake's actions as scummy, rather than presenting the actions themselves. Maverick quoted the posts he's referring to but it's presented objectively in this post. Maverick doesn't know why Jake is angry.<br><br>Jake has presented conflicting motivations in thread. He said pregame was useless (<a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7807095#p7807095\" class=\"postlink\">post 198</a>) and that he was busy (<a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7807361#p7807361\" class=\"postlink\">post 201</a>) and then when he was called on saying the thread was useless (<a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7809163#p7809163\" class=\"postlink\">post 272</a>) he said it was because he's busy and didn't acknowledge the actual foundation for the comment (<a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7809151#p7809151\" class=\"postlink\">post 269</a>.)<br><br>Similarly, he posted a vote for RC (<a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7809965#p7809965\" class=\"postlink\">post 340</a>) and a subsequent explanation (<a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7811745#p7811745\" class=\"postlink\">post 427</a>) which doesn't mention any posts in the game. Then (<a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7812419#p7812419\" class=\"postlink\">post 460</a>) says that he's also read some things in the game which make him think RC is scum. (I can't see any reference to what those posts are but that's a different thing.) Then, when Nos says it's a policy lynch (<a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7812469#p7812469\" class=\"postlink\">post 462</a>, Nosferatu\"],) Jake only quotes his post saying that he has read some of RC's content (<a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7812564#p7812564\" class=\"postlink\">post 468</a>.)<br><br>This is the kind of thing that comes across as lying in the thread.<br><br>I don't know what lying Maverick is referring to about smith, maybe I missed it.

He's basically saying that there was pressure against my argument, as opposed to specifically being pressure against my vote.  There's a logical consistency there, and in fact it represents a plausible read of what happened.<br>The back and forth seems like Maverick found something and jumped on it as much as there truly being anything worth jumping on.  Given that Jake tends to present things in an opaque manner and stonewalls, I don't view maverick's take there as necessarily unreasonable, but it is at least a bit lazy to jump to the \"you're lying\" take on that incident instead of trying to figure out how it might reasonably hold together in his mind.<br>That said, Jake's over the top \"how dare you accuse me of lying you have insulted my honor sir\" bit in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7799078#p7799078\">, [post]604</a>, etc. was ridiculous.

I'm not sure anything between him and FA pinged me as especially notable for AI purposes; I may re-read that later, but that's my first take.  I'm actually starting to lean a little bit town on him.<br><br><div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: Maverick Thoughts</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display: none;\">FWIW, some of this is similar to what FL said in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7817481#p7817481\">663</a>.<br>Looking specifically at Jake's <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7816268#p7816268\">615</a>, which argued that five of Maverick's accusations were false:<br>1 Likely false.  I suppose it's plausible that in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7814778#p7814778\">521</a> Jake was sneaking in that specific wording to try to buy town credit, but it's buried inside of an accusation against me, which makes me think it was more related to the \"why are you annoyed at MOI????\" point (which of course was ridiculous), but his overall game play has been anything but looking for explicit town credit.<br>2/3 (related, response to \"You're backtracking with pedantic little arguments that anyone ought to be able to see through\") Likely false.  I say \"likely\" here because there's an opaqueness to Jake's process that both makes him difficult to read AND plausibly gives him the option to go back and say \"no, this is what I meant\".  That said, I don't see any kind of clear evidence of backtracking or a reliance on pedantry.<br>4 Debatable.  Jake represented getting worked up specifically about the lying portion more than the accusation.  But it could reasonably be that he simply focused on that bit as part of the \"worked up about you thinking I'm scum\" perspective.<br>5 Debatable.  If Jake legitimately thinks that he's being falsely accused of lying, I could buy him getting angry as either alignment.  I could also buy that he's faking it (especially as an easy buy of credibility in case there are other points where he DOES end up lying).  I don't see in-thread evidence that this is clearly true or clearly false.<br>Jake's defense against the other stuff (\"Willingly ignored a large portion of the game\"; not putting effort into reading others; \"tunnelling... a quite weak argument\") seems to boil down to \"I don't play that way, and you can't tell me how to play\".  I don't like that defense at all, but it doesn't make him scum.<br><br>PS There's something specific of Maverick's that I really don't like.  <br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7815318#p7815318\" class=\"postlink\">post 543</a>, Maverick1102 wrote:</cite>I like both the Nos and the JSF Wagons.

Maverick, why did your opinion on this flip between 387 and 543?

So what else changed to make that behavior scummy in your mind?<br><br>PS I'd agree that Jake's vote on me is mediocre, but I'm not sure that it's necessarily insincere or vote parking or anything like that.

It looks like trying to to the nice thing, but comes across as 'we're saving that lynch for later' which simply appears scum-motivated to me. This brings us to her #32 in which she kind of dispels the above, but doesn't really close the case. Lynching an 'unreadable' player D2 in any case is quite likely either scum-motivated or bad play. How you can suggest that you won't have stronger reads than 'unreadable' D2 doesn't sit well with me, and the whole debacle seemed to ignore the posts so far from APF and RC especially. I'm not getting a massively strong read from this in pre-game since it seems more of a theoretical debate than a serious push on a PL D2 due to the lack of game-specific context throughout, but not only does it appear to me as scum-motivated, I also totally wanted to wade in and give my 2 pennies on Policy Lynches.

It looks like trying to to the nice thing, but comes across as 'we're saving that lynch for later' which simply appears scum-motivated to me. This brings us to her #32 in which she kind of dispels the above, but doesn't really close the case. Lynching an 'unreadable' player D2 in any case is quite likely either scum-motivated or bad play. How you can suggest that you won't have stronger reads than 'unreadable' D2 doesn't sit well with me, and the whole debacle seemed to ignore the posts so far from APF and RC especially. I'm not getting a massively strong read from this in pre-game since it seems more of a theoretical debate than a serious push on a PL D2 due to the lack of game-specific context throughout, but not only does it appear to me as scum-motivated, I also totally wanted to wade in and give my 2 pennies on Policy Lynches.

And if it DOES continue indefinitely...<br>2) If this is in fact town v town (I'm not particularly sure atm but it could be) , it sets up almost perfectly for consecutive ML's, with one of you following the other in whatever order.<br>3) Even if you're in a situation where you're town and FA is scum, you're simplifying the engagement here to the point where scum don't really have to be accountable for which side they pick in the fight, or whatever their other reads or engagements are.<br><br>So it's not helpful.  You've made your case.  Unless there is something SPECIFIC, IMPORTANT, AND NEW to say on the subject, just stop.  Let other people read what's happened so far and make their own opinions.  Another few pages of back and forth shouting doesn't provide any useful information to any of us."}

That was productive.</div></blockquote><br><br>There are instances when you think of someone's play as annoying b/c  they're being obstinate and unreadable. Actually, it would be more beneficial to scum to outright accuse that kind of play as being scummy instead of trying to read it. Don't like this 1-dimensional view of how town would have thought.<br>(and then mhs says the same thing^,  better even)<br><br>Also, jake's stance on having not cared about pre-game, then voting for RC on start of D1 with a policy lynch reason, that later changes to some posts he found scummy (posts he didn't bother quoting and posts that came from pre-game) is all over the place. Feels like he's making up things as he goes.

Null. <br> <br>Mhs's <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7814512#p7814512\">518</a> *nods* <br><br>Jakes' <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7814735#p7814735\">519</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7814738#p7814738\">520</a> If Jake had read some posts from pre-game that made him feel RC is suspicious, you'd think he'd have posted them instead of the policy reason he copy and pasted. Call it different play style, but I do not see interest in looking for scum.<br><br>Jakes<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7814778#p7814778\"> 521</a> - <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><strike>Vote: JakefromStateFarm</strike>  </span> I realize he's probably at L-1. In that case, I'm intending to hammer.<br><br>The, \"I've provided two people now\" isn't being open. It's done by both town and scum.<br> The, \"I've done more than other players as well\" when all you've done is 1) try to defend yourself 2) vote RC as a policy lynch although you state it's serious 3)vote mhs as a very weak-case in (I think) self-defense.<br>The, 'why are you pressuring me? Why don't you pressure your other scum reads instead\" is coming off as getting sick of the pressure, leave me alone. Can go both ways though.<br><br> MHS expecting content from you isn't unrealistic though. Everyone was expecting some form of content after 15 pages. We may have expected you not to post content in pre-game, but we didn't expect you not to post ABOUT pre-game in D1. <br>His unvote looked like it came from hesitancy regarding your alignment. I find hesitancy towards aligment more town indicative than unshakeable confidence.<br><br>@Shaddowez, yes, I had other suspicions. I wanted clumsy to reply to me first with my vote on him b/c I really didn't like that post. And the wagon on Nos, and the questioning on Jake was putting good pressure on both of them. Depending on his reply, I was going to keep/change my vote. <br><br>Maverick's <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7815318#p7815318\">543</a> Agree.<br>@Clumsy, first time I read it I was talking to frozen and had my attention there for the most part. Second re-read it felt like you were giving yourself time to look for reason to jump on an existent wagon.<br><br>The lipstick thing helped APF get my gender right. And I couldn't help but think of it everytime I read Nosferatu. <br>Decent vibes on Maverick or myself? Also, did you end up ISOing pregame APF and myself? If so, was there, \"something there\"?<br><br>Maverick's <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7815609#p7815609\">566</a> pretty much the same points I commented on.  <br><br>Jake's<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7815656#p7815656\"> 574</a> - what. So you think mhs is scum and wanna bring out his scum buddies? With frozen as well? In that case 1) you'd have ruined your plan 2) I totally don't think you were doing that.<br>578 -  the Nos defending isn't helping Nos imo.<br>The argument of Maverick and Jake about lying though seems to be semantics. Jake is saying that he didn't lie because he meant mhs INDIRECTLY got pressured to switch his vote, wheras he thinks Maverick meant directly pressured. <br><br>Nos's<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7816228#p7816228\"> 607</a> pings me so so bad. Froot and jake as town? Froot is one of the least posters, not scummy, no, but he hasn't exactly shared much. And jake posts are mainly his self-defense and his weak case on mhs. Although I do agree that Frozen is hard to understand sometimes. <br><br><br>Post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7816268#p7816268\">615</a> Bah Everyone who disagrees with you is scummy. I'm starting to think the only person on your list who isn't scummy is Nos, because he votes mhs after mhs voted for you. And honestly, if either of you flip scum, I'm gonna vote for the other.<br><br>Frozen's <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7816429#p7816429\">641</a> There is a point there.<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7816535#p7816535\">650</a>, @Nos, I think it's fair, esp when the interaction with mhs was scummy to him. He also mentioned his reasons why, which I relate to. <br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7816744#p7816744\">655</a>, RC looks like he's trying to reach out to Nos. I like. Null leaning town.<br><br><br>And wow, so many people replaced out. <br><br>So,  assuming nobody wants to change their vote, this is my intent to hammer Jake."}

It's way more ballsy but looking at the way things turned out, and the likelihood that people will interpret it as TvT, it could be worth it. I think Jake's pregame play shows a player who isn't afraid of having attention, whether that indicates scum-Jake or town-Jake, I don't know, but I don't think scum will necessarily avoid the argument. I think mhsmith mentioned that Jake seemed to be getting panicky and I agree. I think the aggressive behaviour can be a response to being pushed, as well as backing off.

In every other game I've played, by day 1, there's been a few people I checked off as town, a few I suspected as scum, and a few undecided. Even if I was totally wrong, I still had reads. I don't know if it's because of who is in here being hard for me to read, or the replacements ( both number of people making things confusing and slight apathy because of them) , or what, but I'm not getting very many reads. I'm letting town down and I feel bad for it, but I don't know how to fix it. I've read back over things, but have gotten nowhere. I've thought about replacing so someone could play my slot better, but at this point, that'd be shitty to you guys, the Mod, and the replacement who has to recover from this."}

I've played skype mafia games and private message ones as well, and one-on-one can be pretty scary.

And I'm not even sure where she wanted us to go with it even if it was an attempt to influence thinking).  So I was trying to get her to explain where she was going with that a bit more."}

Ditto the \"I'm taking responsibility for clumsy lynch and making sure you guys know it\".  <br>The more I look at this, the more I think that Roshar is simply talking about whatever the hell she wants to talk about at any given moment, as opposed to it being strategic in some way.

Not everyone plays the game like you do, Lowell. Excuse me if I like to get fresh input on the main wagon (esp after Clumsy had new posts).

It's more him feeling bad about being a liability. That parts kinda getting to me. B/c that would be the correct town response to being falsely accused as town. But shouldn't there be some anger and bitterness too? Like 'Screw you guys, I hope it hurts when I flip town?' <br>Now, on to the actual content. I don't like how his read on me changed. Reading something the first time and thinking it's town, then going back and thinking it's scummy, is a thing. But vice-versa, reading something and finding it scummy the first time, then upon a reread thinking it's town, is just never a thing that has occurred to me.

Why? Why would she be willing to take the risk of a flash lynch in less that 20 hrs when she had found Maxous' posting not town? And who would she rather lynch? Lowell. Did she ever scum-read Lowell? No. But all of a sudden she feels so strong about not lynching Max. Like I'd understand if she wanted to lynch me instead b/c I was such a strong scum read, and had tried convincing the masses and pushing me through D1. But no. She comes out last day, appeals to people about not lynching the two lynch candidates by suggesting Lowell (b/c her lack of push on me D1 wasn't exactly going to get me lynched). <br><br>Town would not react this way. When faced with two players who had performed scummy at some point or another. Like Clumsy for me, for example. His recent tone felt more town, but I still felt he was damned by his previous posting.

This is not the thought process of someone who doesn't know alignment. When you have doubt/suspicion about someone, that doubt never goes away.

And it's kinda interesting to note, two players actually responded positively to Huntress' suggestion of a Lowell lynch. Yet, when she came back, she never pushed it. She just repeated herself.

When you're critical of them you're more likely to grapple with the theory of the scumhunting, whereas when you're critical of something more subjective you're inclined to think of what ulterior motives could be behind it.<br><br>Now, I don't think scum!Titus deliberately thought through all that, but I do think she might've instinctively/unconsciously seized upon this manner of scumhunting because of the safety of it. And the fact that it's D3 and the scum only need two mislynches makes me uncomfortable to follow her when she's identified two easy targets.<br><br>So my top two scumreads right now are FAQ and Titus.

Did that meta read ever come up?<br>Max was basically accusing Huntress of non-participation, which is more of a mafia-aligned behavior.  Whether said accusation is fair is a different story, but that was the accusation.  As far as town reads go, that's putting information into thread, and I'd think that's generally a good thing.<br><br>3) <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7854037#p7854037\">1198</a>:<br>574 - I think Jake has been sufficiently opaque and unclear in his wording of things in general that I don't particularly have a problem with either Roshar's or Huntress's side of reading what he was up to.  Even re-reading that post I don't know what he was trying to say, so... *shrugs*<br>615 - I agree with Huntress here.<br>521 - I largely agree with Huntress here.

It's difficult for everyone else to read Nos if she isn't being open about her thought process and engagement, and Nos has a playstyle she likes and seems to think is effective.  Meh on my end here.<br>Nos <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7842001#p7842001\">1106</a> - I enjoyed Nos's rebuttal here.  OTOH, Roshar's point seems reasonable to me.  Nos said she'd move it when something else pinged her, 28 pages later, nothing pinged her, and she wasn't really pushing me either.  I get that it can potentially be a playstyle thing, but it seems weird IMO.  I think it's fair to push on it.<br><br>6) Day 2 - I was fine w/ Roshar's stuff on D2 as well (after mulling it over anyway)<br><br>7) <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7894516#p7894516\">1554</a><br>I find Huntress's explanations here plausible.  Roshar's attribution of wolf motivation is reachy, although not an unreasonable explanation for what happened.  But there is entirely reasonable town motivation for what happened too.  This is IMO null behavior on Huntress's end.<br><br>8) <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7895869#p7895869\">1577</a><br>I feel fine with Huntress's responses here too.<br><br>9) <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7895948#p7895948\">1578</a><br>Meh.  It's a narrative, and yes, it COULD be the truth.  But it feels like conf!bias fitting Huntress's actions into the story that Roshar already believes, as opposed to truly having found anything damning (or being something that Roshar was completely making up).<br>I'd also note that there is plenty of time to shift wagons EOD.  EOD1 was 8:45 PM EST, something like 6 hours after the actual hammer (which itself was about 3 hours after Huntress pushed out Roshar and Lowell as alternatives), which is plenty of time for people to show up and move things around.  <br>1579-80... yeah, I do think it's plausibly genuine.  In my mind, Roshar fits a model of aggressive newb!town, which is why I'm town-reading her even with some stuff that feels reachy in my book.<br><br>10) Overall: I think Huntress's case on Roshar is a LOT less strong than Huntress seems to think it is, but I can see this as a legitimate thought progression, and I'm increasingly inclined to think the reverse is true as well.  If someone wants to try and re-sell these wagons to me, I guess I'll listen, but right now <span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"font-size: 200%; line-height: 116%;\">I ACTIVELY OPPOSE BOTH OF THESE WAGONS</span></span>.<br><br><br>So what's a better wagon then?

In practice, Roleblockers are more likely to stop Town power roles from working early on, but as the game goes on Roleblockers become much more powerful. In particular, when there is one Mafioso left Roleblockers can be used to confirm players - if the Mafia's kill goes through, whoever was blocked that Night isn't the last Mafioso. Inversely, if a Roleblocker blocks someone and the Mafia's kill disappears, there is a decent chance that the Roleblocker blocked the scum who was performing the kill (though this is not necessarily the case, given that other power roles may have had a hand in it, or the scum decided to not kill anyone as a framing gambit). In summary, Town Roleblockers are almost liabilities early on but become much stronger if they survive to lategame, so they have net positive value for Town.</div></blockquote>"}

I had a look through Shaddowez' ISO and nothing jumped out at me. <br><br>I also had a look at Huntress' ISO to see if there's anything interesting. Some notes:<br>- Her initial scumreads were me, Roshar and Clumsy. I believe Roshar's town, so this is a totally town pool (bearing in mind that I know I'm town.) This might have some bearing on her subsequent pool (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7882267#p7882267\">1464</a>.) Again, we've got Max and Roshar (town) but also Lowell and APF. She also subsequently speculated about Lowell and APF being scumpartners (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7898791#p7898791\">1597</a>.)<br>- I remember thinking at the time that her questioning of Titus' VC post was weird and unnecessary. Now it can be viewed as fabricated content but it's an interesting choice.<br>- I searched her ISO for Johnny and there's basically nothing. Johnny asked her about when she was going to post and she said she watched him on N1. From a search, there's also nothing on the Shaddowez/Gamr slot.<br>- She posted positively about FA_Q2's play (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7896883#p7896883\">1586</a>) when asked, but similarly about mhsmith, so this isn't indicative for me either way.<br><br>So, Huntress posted an all-town lynchpool and she stated strong scum reads on Roshar and Max, town players. I think this indicates that she's likely to avoid her scum partners in-thread. This puts Lowell and APF in a better light for me. Her questioning of Titus is odd and I think it's possible that this was designed to allow her to question another player safely when she was under a bit of pressure from Roshar.<br><br>Also, this point:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7909237#p7909237\" class=\"postlink\">post 1684</a>, mhsmith0 wrote:</cite>Probably Titus's move onto Huntress after Roshar's push deserves the most scrutiny, given the claimed NK block and the plausible outcome that Huntress had been caught by a PR.</div></blockquote><br><br>We need to remember that throughout D3, scum would have known that Huntress had been caught.

There's two possible interpretations in my mind:<br>1) He's scum: he knows Huntress has been interfered with and that because of this there was no kill (ie. there's corroborating evidence.) So, when you come out and post your case against Huntress, he attacks you and townreads Huntress? <br>2) He's town: you come in with a case against Huntress which he views as questionable. He sees it as fabricated content and his response to this is to scumread you and completely ignore you and your legitimate question in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7894990#p7894990\">1564</a>.<br><br>I think the second situation is more likely.

Two reasons. 1) It came first thing D3, right after the announcement of the no NK. 2) His reasons were those from D2, which he directly quoted when he was asked. Almost feels like an effort to quickly settle on a vote before a possible role blocker appeared.<br><br>@APF I would not mind lynching Heur today. I'm considering he may be partners with Titus. I haven't yet done a detailed analysis on both slots, but one thing in particular that I noticed was his Titus read. There was so little there, and it was basically discussing the technique titus was using instead of assessing the slot. <br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Because of the pre game business I mentioned the slight scum lean. I noticed that Titus seems to like to post most right after a vote count and not much at other times, and I think it gives that player a little power since they are pretty much commencing the next step in the game, it could be a power gaining role thing, similar to a phone call and the person getting in the last word having the most power, or two men shaking hands and the one that lets go first being in the weaker position. Not a scum or town specific tell, but kind of gives more leading power in my opinion if true. I would like to see more posts, but I'm feeling null slight scum lean.</div></blockquote><br><br>Titus' recent responses to froot have only made my scum read stronger. I do not believe she believes her reasons for voting Lowell. I wanted to wait a bit before changing my mind on Lowell and voting Titus to see if she was going to vote Lowell as well. And she did. And I think it was a predictable move, if Titus is scum. He's (lowell) an easy vote, and his D3 actions can be way too easily presented as scum motivated. This makes me more and more confident that he's not scum. What's the most important thing that all scum need to do? Blend in. Would they scum-read a PR to fish for a claim and town read their scum buddy, and make themselves look terrible D4? No.  This makes absolutely no sense. The fact that Titus is pushing this superficial read is solidifying my scum read on her. <br><br>@Johnny, The titus wagon comprises of Froot and I (excluding FaQ). When did I push you?  And where did Froot push you? The reasons we're voting Titus have little to do with finding her intimidating. There has been a long back and forth between froot and titus. Did you form an opinion on any of it?<br><br>@Titus, you said you thought scum would have voted Huntress quickly after my claim and without questioning it b/c they would have known it was correct. That leaves us with Lowell and Garmr/Heur. Would you be willing to vote for Heuristically, if his wagon takes?"}

You're concerned about me not moving my vote, because you think that's scummy? Or because you may have an idea who I am? You follow it with a, \"yet, I'm struggling...agree with\" meaning that the concern isn't me being scummy.

Read through rosh's ISO and note every single time that he mentions huntress prior to post 1508 (the Max lynch).  Universally rosh mentioned that huntress is a low posting slot that he cannot get a goo dread on.  There are multiple pushes for more content from the slot itself and even one post that I would consider soft defending the slot itself in 1417.  Going into day 3 there is little to zero indication that rosh has a hard scum read through day 2.  Right in the beginning of day 3 though rosh pushes huntress immediately.  If I were scum that just had a failed kill that would ping my radar rather hard.<br><br>Now, that does not mean that they would necessarily KNOW that rosh was the one that blocked the kill (and it could have even been a doctor) so I think that they would likely try and draw a claim out.

I'll add that shaddow and Garmr had been doing more hiding than anything else. If it were just an individual player you may be able to pass it off as them being busy or apathetic. But when you see it from two different players in the same slot, then it becomes more likely that the behavior is a result of the slot. All my points may not quite \"prove it\", but I don't see anything better against Lowell either."}

At worst, they end up same as if they didn't submit a kill. But we may be going too far with their speculation.

It's worth noting that her night action was informed by her day read of Huntress; without the day read, the night action doesn't work.

The nature of how she pushed the case created the potential for associations to develop.  It's easy to say \"well that's just what you should do\", but it's not always easy to pull it off."}

I wanted to force her not to NK me. This meant I'd be protected, if titus was scum, or if someone else was. The one thing I didn't consider was that she'd opt for a no kill, and I'm lucky I decided on blocking her in the end.

An even-night RB and an odd-night JK are probably stronger than a single, every-night JK, since the roles are dispersed over two players and there's the possibility for a second town slot to get the kind of soft towncred a PR confers. A strongman can both ensure the kill gets through and cast doubt on the kill-stopping roles.

Hindsight is 20 20 and all but if she was going to claim I would have claimed something without a modifier or just went for vanilla town.  As my role was not known - voyeur would not have been a bad idea.  Perhaps hider as well - something that is not particularly strong (or at least not as strong as a doc) or a BG (though BG would have to deal with not saving roshar so that is most likely a bad idea."}
