No outside communication about this game unless your role permits it.<br>2. Don't quote your Role PM or any out-of-thread communications. Don't fake-quote it, either. Paraphrasing is fine.<br>3. Do not edit/delete your posts.<br>4. To vote somebody, either bold your vote, such as <span class=\"noboldsig\">vote: ChaosOmega</span>, or use vote tags, such as <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: ChaosOmega</span>. If your vote isn't bolded or vote tagged, it will not count. Unvotes are not necessary to change your vote.<br>5. During the day, a player will be lynched when they have more than 50% of the players currently alive voting for them. Once that amount has been reached, they're dead. No unvotes will save them. Players can post in the thread up until I post the lynch scene and the thread is locked.<br>6. Once it has been posted by me that you are dead, you're dead. Do not post any more, <span class=\"noboldsig\">not even a bah post</span>.<br>7. Every day will have a deadline of 2 weeks. Extensions will be given for extreme circumstances.<br>8. Nights will have a deadline of 2 days. If you have a night action and do not send one, you will do nothing.<br>9. If you're going to be gone for longer than a 48-hour period, post in-thread letting everyone know for how long. If 48 hours pass without a player posting or saying they will be absent, I will prod them. For the purposes of this rule, the weekend counts as 24 hours.<br>10. If a player would receive a fourth prod (unless it is their first prod of the day) or they have not responded to a prod within 24 hours, I will search for a replacement for them.<br>11. <span style=\"color: #0040FF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">#0040FF is my color. Don't use it.</span></span> Also, no small or invisible text or cryptography.<br>12. Please PM me if you have any questions about the game.<br>13. Have fun.<br>14.

This seems like a post planned for covering up the gambit unless I'm missing something?</div></blockquote><br><br>1) Because I had already started confronting him before. What does me questioning a player who made questionable moves have to do with anything?<br>2) Read what you quoted dude, SC thought that he had been voted because of his RVS vote, when it was pretty obvious RC was reaction testing. (At least I think it was pretty obvious he was, he gave no stated reason for the vote and said it was non-rvs)<br>3) Two Reasons: First is, With the line of questioning we were heading down, any results from said questioning would only tell about him, and if a wagon started to form then it would be pretty easy for scum to get on it and coast on it for an easy lynch. Second is if he was scum then it would be a quick confession in case he bought the trick.<br>5) What does my logic and Super's logic have to do with each other? I condemned Super for pulling arbitrary logic out of his ass to justify his reaction to RC's vote. That has nothing to do with a fakevig. And what reason do I have to cover up the gambit? What motivation do I even have to do that as Scum? Your townreading Super (I guess?) but if I'm scum then Super has to be Scum also, since the only reason I would pull that fakevig as Scum would be to save his ass.</div></blockquote><br>1)- The distinct possibility you're scum pushing on something that isn't scummy?<br>2)- So because you knew it was a reaction test, everyone else knew?<br>3)- You are making no fucking sense. How does it matter if one line of questioning tells us about one person? Why do you think it'd only tell us about Super?<br>4)- First bit is strawman. You're saying I said that your gambit is the same as what super did, whereas I just used it to emphasise the logical fallacy.<br>The movitation as scum is to collect towncred or get a claim (like Glork told us.), and it makes no sense that you would only do it with a super!partner."}

This seems like a post planned for covering up the gambit unless I'm missing something?</div></blockquote><br><br>1) Because I had already started confronting him before. What does me questioning a player who made questionable moves have to do with anything?<br>2) Read what you quoted dude, SC thought that he had been voted because of his RVS vote, when it was pretty obvious RC was reaction testing. (At least I think it was pretty obvious he was, he gave no stated reason for the vote and said it was non-rvs)<br>3) Two Reasons: First is, With the line of questioning we were heading down, any results from said questioning would only tell about him, and if a wagon started to form then it would be pretty easy for scum to get on it and coast on it for an easy lynch. Second is if he was scum then it would be a quick confession in case he bought the trick.<br>5) What does my logic and Super's logic have to do with each other? I condemned Super for pulling arbitrary logic out of his ass to justify his reaction to RC's vote. That has nothing to do with a fakevig. And what reason do I have to cover up the gambit? What motivation do I even have to do that as Scum? Your townreading Super (I guess?) but if I'm scum then Super has to be Scum also, since the only reason I would pull that fakevig as Scum would be to save his ass.</div></blockquote><br>1)- The distinct possibility you're scum pushing on something that isn't scummy?<br>2)- So because you knew it was a reaction test, everyone else knew?<br>3)- You are making no fucking sense. How does it matter if one line of questioning tells us about one person? Why do you think it'd only tell us about Super?<br>4)- First bit is strawman. You're saying I said that your gambit is the same as what super did, whereas I just used it to emphasise the logical fallacy.<br>The movitation as scum is to collect towncred or get a claim (like Glork told us.), and it makes no sense that you would only do it with a super!partner.</div></blockquote>.<br><br>1) But clearly RC thought it was scummy, are you saying RC is scummy too? SC was the only one who had really done anything remotely scummy, did you want me to simply sit back?<br>2) Well did you think it was a reaction test? Because I thought it was a pretty transparent RT. Especially considering RC still hasn't released her reason for voting him.<br>3) Because if it only tells us about one person, then it's easy for scum to simply coast on that, especially since the line of questioning was turning to make SC appear scummy. I thought it would only tell about Super because it spawned from Super pulling arbitrary RVS rules out of his ass. Nobody, scum or otherwise, would try to defend that, and so if a Wagon spawned, it would revolve entirely around Super's fuck-up.<br>4) What is the logical fallacy I made? As for the second part, I oversaw both of those possibilities, forgive me."}

He has kept up with what has happened in the game, so I don't think he would be lurking if he wasn't in the time zone he is in. That said, he hasn't posted anything alignment indicative and so I read him as null.<br><br>Annadog40 - Need moar posts.<br><br>Soapbar - I haven't really seen anything from soap that indicates either alignment, so soap remains null for me.<br><br>revalista - No posts...<br><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #BF4000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Scum Leans</span></span></span><br>shadoxx8 - Although he has only posted once, I lean him as scum for trying to RVS at page 6 (RVS ended at the bottom of page 3 <span class=\"noboldsig\">tops</span>) and faking inability to vote correctly (he has been in 6 previous games and <span class=\"noboldsig\">still</span> doesn't know how to vote even when the moderators are clear about how to do it?)<br><br>nosferatu - Nos is the perfect example of a lurker trying to look active.

The only people at this point that he could vote that had no posts (or only RVS) were revalista and annadog40. <br><br>The most baffling part of this all is that Firesong insists that this proves Soap is scum and doesn't prove shadoxx. This hypocrisy and backwards logic is why I suspect Firesong so much and why I am going to keep a close eye on shadoxx."}

The last time I pushed on shadoxx was when I tried to get him to talk by voting him in post 246 on last friday at 2:07 pm (my time) well before Firesong's nightly posting session. What I don't get is why she decided to accuse me of zealotry two days after I last did any sort of pushing on shadoxx. Seems kind of incorrect in calling me zealous right now, since if I was zealous then it wouldn't have been 3 days (by now) since I pushed at all on shadoxx/maxous."}

I dont get RC though. I remember playing in some games way back when I was active before I recently came out of retirement, but for the life of me I can't remember the playing style to guide me, so I am sitting and watching that one. I do though agree somewhat with Mario's statement about RC getting bored being an indicative of a tell, but dont know if that is town or otherwise... again I dont particularly take a pre-supopsed tell as proof. Shadow is inmy scum list due to lack of content,  Anadog stays there based on the recent ramblings offered up, in all it  is a pretty slow game at the moment and I particularly do not like D1.  I also realise that in some way I am actually mirroring Markara with regard to Rory, but my gut is twitching also there its a feeling I have towrads him... <br><br>I dont get the Fire thing though?

I take on board the fact that Nos is L1 but I dont really see the reason for the lynch, never have done maybe I am just blind to the arguement.  I dont like Makara's current play and ask myself why he would not jump on Nos if he has a scum read albeit weak. he states that there is no strong counter wagon so parks his vote on Rory?  makes no sense.

I'm from back in the day and this is my first forum mafia game here in about 2-3 years or something like that. I see some of you are newer to this game and for that I can forgive you for the tragedy of this game that we've called scumhunting. Honestly I'm just having a bit of trouble comprehending how we've come to this point without getting a scum lynch but Glork's weak modifier and him suiciding(or dying) is probably the reason. I don't see an SK being in this setup purely based off the behavior of people on my wagon and the fact that NL'ing didn't bring about a kill, especially on a claimed tracker. I'm fairly confident we're dealing with a 3-man scum team. That aside, it really doesn't matter. Town is guaranteed a loss if we don't lynch scum. I only went down that path based on Glork's death. If you're wanting to bounce walls with me, no. I hate bouncing walls between two people in a back and forth. It's bad. Keep your points clear and where everyone can read them please. This will be my longest post of the game because it's 29 pages of content condensed into one post. <br><br>There are going to be a literal fuckton of quotes in this post and it's going to clog up the page. Bear with me here. If you see quotations without an actual quote, I'm quoting the person I recently used quote tags for and am keeping this post as short as possible. I've already meta'd some of you to help with reads just because I'm not familiar with much of the newer playerbase post-2012. I'm not going to bring it up(meta can or cannot be literally fucking useless on a per-game basis and isn't reliable) but just wanted some experience with certain players' playstyles, scum and town. Let's get this shit started.<br><br><br>RC is pretty town purely based on the non-RVS vote within 3 minutes of super posting. This first page was pretty quality in terms of RVS with super/RC. Uh-oh, Slandaar is bringing it into the theoretical. Bad. Not telling but not a good way to go for reads. Funny thing: you guys all are saying RVS could be infinite. That might've held over up to Day 3 even considering noone lynched scum so far. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7278385#p7278385\" class=\"postlink\">post 22</a>, Soapbar wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7278238#p7278238\" class=\"postlink\">post 11</a>, supercool898 wrote:</cite>Your vote can only be non-RVS if you were also saying mine was. <strike>Otherwise you would have no reason you have given for your vote</strike><br><br>PEdit: Oh wait, this is RC I'm playing with...

If it's fake, I'm looking for some more hate and conviction. I feel really good about this. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Soap wrote:</cite>Should I have kept it going longer? I didn't know lol. This is the first gambit I've ever done.</div></blockquote><br>You shouldn't have done it at all. It was pretty dumb and didn't yield a lot of information. You should wait until you've played more games with more experienced players, some of the best on the site(Hoopla especially, if she's still around), and then you can consider gambitting. It doesn't always go well but this was a normal game so you have a bit more leeway over a theme, where you usually don't know anything about the roles in the game.<br><br>Dear God, Rory's omgus vote.

He just placed an RVS vote before that post you're responding to here.<br><br>Right after, smudger posts. It wasn't a great post but wasn't particularly bad.

And plenty of those questions you love to eat and swallow up to never see the light of day again as a side order. Based on the \"goons\" or \"scum PR\". This is a closed setup as far as I'm aware but the paid attention to that last part in bold sends bad vibes all the way. I just don't like it. Burn it with fire and make it dead. <br><br>I'm done with this for now because I did this ISO to compare his later-game playing and all these posts are within a 30 minute span but didn't sit well with me. I'm going to his later game play for my comparison I wanted to do. Note-worthy of this ISO: Firesong pays very good attention to VT vs PR discussions and shows very good knowledge of the game and what you should/shouldn't be doing throughout the day regarding them. He is also very careful when mentioning them. This same knowledge retroactively goes out the window in other posts not concerning the setup but concerning the game and what's going on in it. I do not like this. Ok, so I completed the ISO. All there is is just a \"you scored a townpoint\" to Soap. Nothing else since basically what I've quoted from early D1. Yeah, not good. No watching Soap more closely was done. Not D1. Not D2, not D3 but that can be excused. I have really bad gut feelings about it. Not scumhunting the whole game despite having scumreads, not having the vote on someone who's your only scumread, being so careful about where the vote is D1, posting about the PR's, the whole deal. Individual posts don't stand out but the big picture does and I think that's where the true tell is. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>MM4 wrote:</cite>Everyone should vote for Soapbar.

He just expects you to address the fact that there was a fakevig earlier and it doesn't sit right with him. He didn't expect you to have actual reads but just felt it was odd you didn't comment on anything. This isn't a scumtell at all from Soap.<br><br>The annadog push from Glork is quality.

Post-game this needs to be paid attention to in case of troll. <br><br>MM4 is consistent with his thoughts. This town is very on track.

Stick to the scum vs town argument. <br><br>RC could've done slightly better but didn't read into everything too much. The null reads and nothing strong is unfortunate. I keep looking at super's posts and nothing sticks out to me. Nothing especially town but certainly nothing scum.

This is exactly what I meant by individual posts but the bigger picture. I agreed with this. When I looked in post 56 to see what you meant, I realized it was perfectly acceptable to place that vote after a fakevig. In fact, RVS was fine simply because there were so many lurkers in the game up to that point and he had contributed and may not have had a scumread at the time. This focus, which anyone such as yourself would see and should have the sense and understanding to comprehend(I mentioned your mafia knowledge earlier), is why this feels so fake to me. You should know better. You even linked each post so I know that you read them yet you pursued this knowing the context.

You definitely knew a vig wasn't a possibility but introduced it regardless just to play the role. <br><br>At this point you guys should have abandoned the Glork speculation. There's too much WIFOM and not enough fact. The only way I see a Glork crumb is if he has capitalized a letter of the post to spell out a name and it's in the set of posts leading up to the night.

It's interesting MM and Maxous post here. Scum lost daytalk at this point, though, so never mind what I'm saying. If they had day talk, I assumed they wouldn't have posted. Look at Ari's first post D2. It's a vote on Makara despite Makara not being a hugely popular wagon before and I'm assuming their tracker claim was made with this in mind in order to give it some credibility. In other words, it was pre-planned. This is likely because scum had daytalk at this time. <br><br>MM rushes out the door with a Max vote. Max says we probably shouldn't lynch. This is interesting because this scum tracker claim was pre-planned. Would scum wait before voting for him to post it? Would they say \"hey we shouldn't lynch today, let's NL\"?

Unfortunately from what I understand, the bodyguard is multiple-use and the bulletproof isn't. Makara should have been using it often as he could've confirmed himself and someone else as town at the same time or gambitted with some other things but let's not get into that right now. This ended up helping the game get to where it is now with a lot of town dead but the lynches are the real enemy here. Makara may not have used it specifically because he thought he would die. The role PM is worded such that it looks like you die if you successfully protect someone and it negates the 1-shot BP. When I asked the mod for clarification however, the 1-shot BP is used if you successfully protect someone and you don't die. I doubt Makara clarified this with the mod either and that's a big mistake that's on him.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>MM4 wrote:</cite>I don't believe makara knows what a 1-Shot Bulletproof Bodyguard does, and having saw both PR flips stuck together a modifier and a random role.<br>It makes sense we'd have at least one Investigative role and Tracker makes more sense than Bodyguard; both flipped PRs deal with death.</div></blockquote><br>The first line there should be more indicative of why Makara wouldn't have used it and that Makara was town, not scum. The second line is speculation and I'd rather not get into that game. You could say the same about having at least one protective role assuming a vig and a scumteam, now couldn't you? This is a protective vs. investigative point and isn't alignment-telling at all.<br><br>Aristo claiming this information on Day 3 instead of Day 2 is all sorts of bad. Town wouldn't do that and would hope there would be a protective role, moreso with two town members dying on N1 instead of just one. I can maybe seeing the wait it out option with one flip but two flips is where you call it too many and abort mission. This is a gambit if I've ever seen it, especially with the early vote being placed on D2.

This post will actually basically bring you up to speed on everything you should reread in this thread as well as my thoughts on the game so far. I'm going to give a quick summary of the situation now.<br><br>-Aristo claims tracker. Voted makara D1.<br>-Makara claims 1shot bp bodyguard, no actions up to here.<br>-Wagons get to L-2, luckily noone was dumb enough for L-1<br>-Soap switches back to NL and turns D3 back towards it<br>-Aristo gets an \"epiphany\" and realizes NL is great. No. Lynching caught scum D2 and hoping for a protective PR was great.<br>-So what happens N3?<br>-Scum take my 1-shot BP because lulz and they tricked you all. Noone even thinks about this or that this happened, either. That's what really baffles me. <br>-You've all been taken into the backstage and gone for the cake but it was a lie. A dirty lie. There are not two investigative roles that are almost the same.<br><br>And you know what? Right now, I'm pretty pissed. N3 was bullshit; I just wished I replaced in D3. Scum wouldn't want to make a kill regardless with a NL. If they do, everyone's reads may change by process of elimination. If this guy was a tracker, there's probably an RB. He would get no result regardless. But he's not so I don't even care about that speculation. You need to think about this.<strike>There is no strongman. No. There is not. I refuse to believe it. Why? Because I'm a 1-shot BP.</strike> Actually maybe there is. I don't know. That would be even more evidence towards this guy being scum, though. This is seriously black and white. We are not NL'ing today. I refuse. If you want to win, scum, you have to use your NK on me to shut me up."}

I made the tl;dr wallpost because I'm not reading through this thread and going back and making multiple posts. It took me five hours. Let's be clear here. I am not spending more than 5 hours to make it neat when it only takes an hour to read the thread. I post my thoughts as I go; I don't want to go back after reading through. And again, I'm not posting just one case on one person here. This is a 29 page game and there's a lot of content in it. Everyone needs to put input on who they want to vote and who they think is scum throughout the game. I did that and let my reads develop as I went through the game in the post.

But combined with a vig and given the reads on that player, it makes it decent enough as an investigative role if there's a massclaim and the weak role survives, which it didn't. Bottom Line- it makes more sense for a protective role to be coupled in with these two and not much sense at all for a tracker with no modifier to be thrown in. Assuming the weak md lives, you have a one-sided setup come claim time."}

You've unvoted aristo because \"aristo never gave up as scum before\". He never did the same as town either. He's also never played with me before. Fire's voting me because \"I looked over his meta and he plays like this as scum\". I mean, I usually expect people to link the games or quote the posts they use for the meta <span style=\"font-style: italic\">at the least</span> but that hasn't happened here. Not to mention that meta is garbage unless you're extremely familiar with a player and know their personality. I warned people about using meta in my replace-in post. It's not reliable. You'll learn. <br><br>Like I said, I'm not giving out free passes with all the bullshit anymore. Aristo has officially given up at this game. He knows he can't lynch me and he's afraid of outing his partners. If you can't see that by now and you're town, that's your problem because you aren't as good at this game as you think you are. Anyone defending Aristo when he isn't even TRYING is now seen as scummy and that includes you. No more VI cards. I can't do a double VI situation. When people give up, that's anti-town no matter how you look at it. Town won't do it because that's against their wincon. They want a scum lynch and will do anything to prevent a mislynch in MYLO. Scum do it only if it plays to their advantage i.e. there's no hope, they don't feel in the game, and they can hurt their chances at winning by producing content and posting more. This has LONG been a discussion that's over. This guy has scumclaimed in thread about 3 times with his bullshit posts. And he's been defended. By you and Fire. For no reason. You don't know his alignment. Don't tell me you fucking do. Not unless you're his scumbuddy. Because I know he's scum thanks to his claim on me. I KNOW he's scum. I KNOW my push is in the right place. Yet you've chainsaw defended him because \"paranoia\" and \"lol meta\". NOPE. This is done. If you're town, you're playing like retards by defending him. Town lets people present their points and debate it out. It produces content. Defending someone who REFUSES to defend themselves is not something town does. If you're scum, you're playing against your wincon and outing yourself as his buddies in the most obvious fashion possible.<br><br>This is an argument that shouldn't have to be made."}

You think that Aristo/Hindu are sk/scum. And Ariso of course, being the sk and incapable of resisting a high profile, decides to fake claim tracker guilty on makara, who happens to be scum. Makara of course fake claims bodyguard, all as a scum tactic to get a counterlynch on Aristo, instead of hey, just saying that he's full of shit and saying he didn't go anywhere. This same sk, aristo, who can't resist the spotlight, evidenced by his desire to boldly claim tracker during MyLo, also happened to NOT KILL ONCE THE ENTIRE FUCKING GAME.

I'm looking at whoever's town, especially Fire/Nos.<br><br>Look at the above quotes. Aristo is ready to hang at this point: scum is ready to hang. Nos then goes for Fire. This wasn't scum-intent. Based on my interactions with Nos yesterday, she's fairly obvtown. At this point, EVERYONE expresses desire for Fire to hang. What does this mean? Fire's scum? Maybe. You can't be very sure but it's likely that she's not scum based entirely off that small mini-point. The only person who doesn't want to vote Fire is super and I'm pretty sure he's scum now. Honestly I think he's a better lynch than Fire. <span class=\"noboldsig\">I think super is a FANTASTIC lynch</span>. That post he made was scummy as shit while he tried his best to look like he was being helpful and failed. And a Nos lynch is honestly a bit laughable after all of that if you ask me. Fire's reaction to that pressure was indeed scummy though because it was the first time any pressure was on her for a lynch and she unvoted...going \"unsure\". lel. I think super should hang based off that last page. That was so fuckin' scummy.<br><br>Whoever's town: you need to step up in my place tomorrow and initiate discussion and be as vocal as possible and post about everything. It does help. Look at this D4 compared to D3. Yeah, that's the power of discussion. D2 was pretty cringe as well. This town was absolutely falling apart. Do everything you can to initiate discussion or you will lose. I'm not saying someone come in here and be me. I just mean post. Post as MUCH as you can. If you guys post anything like you've been doing D2 or D3, this is probably gg."}

When I first sided with aristo, it was because of makara's lack of knowledge on his role that made me believe he was fake claiming, but I then became a little unsure about my read and then justified it by how aristo voted makara on his first post (as seen in post 709).<br><br>When Hindu replaced in and argued that scum had daychat on D-2, I realized that the plan could have been made then allowing him to make a fake crumb. Since my belief of aristo's claim was anchored by that one point, I no longer had my proof that aristo was tracker and with the combination of hindu's points and townie feel, I decided to support him over aristo. My points are backed up in post 736.<br><br>In my post 736, I also mention that I didn't want to bring him to L-1 since then he could hammer himself and keep us from talking (I had that happen in my first game, so I was wary this time) but then fire got on anyway and I wasn't able to cast my vote without hammering aristo. I also didn't realize until after you voted aristo that his wasn't at L-1 anymore (as seen in post 896) and voted him afterward. So, as we can see I did not quietly slide onto aristo's wagon but instead was supporting Hindu.<br><br>In response to you saying that I was passive and quiet, I think these complaints mainly (if not only) apply to today. I have been quiet for most of today since not many people have been talking today, and I was more quiet yesterday since I was agreeing with what most people were saying and didn't want to clog up the thread repeating what everybody else had already said.<br><br>As for being passive, I have only been passive today.
