No outside communication about this game unless your role permits it.<br>\n2. Don't quote your Role PM or any out-of-thread communications. Don't fake-quote it, either. Paraphrasing is fine.<br>\n3. Do not edit/delete your posts.<br>\n4. To vote somebody, either bold your vote, such as <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">vote: ChaosOmega</div>, or use vote tags, such as <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: ChaosOmega</span>. If your vote isn't bolded or vote tagged, it will not count. Unvotes are not necessary to change your vote.<br>\n5. During the day, a player will be lynched when they have more than 50% of the players currently alive voting for them. Once that amount has been reached, they're dead. No unvotes will save them. Players can post in the thread up until I post the lynch scene and the thread is locked.<br>\n6. Once it has been posted by me that you are dead, you're dead. Do not post any more, <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">not even a bah post</div>.<br>\n7. Every day will have a deadline of 2 weeks. Extensions will be given for extreme circumstances.<br>\n8. Nights will have a deadline of 2 days. If you have a night action and do not send one, you will do nothing.<br>\n9. If you're going to be gone for longer than a 48-hour period, post in-thread letting everyone know for how long. If 48 hours pass without a player posting or saying they will be absent, I will prod them. For the purposes of this rule, the weekend counts as 24 hours.<br>\n10. If a player would receive a fourth prod (unless it is their first prod of the day) or they have not responded to a prod within 24 hours, I will search for a replacement for them.<br>\n11. <div style=\"display:inline;color:#0040FF\">#0040FF is my color.

(At least I think it was pretty obvious he was, he gave no stated reason for the vote and said it was non-rvs)<br>\n3) Two Reasons: First is, With the line of questioning we were heading down, any results from said questioning would only tell about him, and if a wagon started to form then it would be pretty easy for scum to get on it and coast on it for an easy lynch. Second is if he was scum then it would be a quick confession in case he bought the trick.<br>\n5) What does my logic and Super's logic have to do with each other? I condemned Super for pulling arbitrary logic out of his ass to justify his reaction to RC's vote. That has nothing to do with a fakevig. And what reason do I have to cover up the gambit?

For Soap, RVS was acceptable since there were very few people who were posting, and the people who were hadn't made many posts. These were the number of posts made by players other than Soap (not counting RVS posts)<br>\n<br>\nsupercool898: 14<br>\nRC: 11<br>\nSlandaar: 2<br>\nRory: 1<br>\n<br>\nRight then he could only really vote one of the above players to have a non-RVS vote, but nobody here did anything particularly scummy so a vote on them would be silly. At that point, an RVS would not be scummy.<br>\n<br>\nHere are the number of posts made by players other than shadoxx (again not counting RVS)<br>\n<br>\nsupercool898: 26<br>\nSoapbar: 26<br>\nGlork: 21<br>\nRC: 17<br>\nnosferatu: 7<br>\nSlandaar: 5<br>\nRory: 4<br>\nMarioManiac4: 4<br>\nFiresong: 2<br>\nSmudger: 2<br>\n<br>\nSee the difference yet? shadoxx had so many more posts to work with than Soapbar had, and yet he still made an RVS vote. The only people at this point that he could vote that had no posts (or only RVS) were revalista and annadog40. <br>\n<br>\nThe most baffling part of this all is that Firesong insists that this proves Soap is scum and doesn't prove shadoxx. This hypocrisy and backwards logic is why I suspect Firesong so much and why I am going to keep a close eye on shadoxx.", "time": "Fri Oct 09, 2015 7:44 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=63625&start=225", "forum": "53", "thread": "63625"}

I dont get RC though. I remember playing in some games way back when I was active before I recently came out of retirement, but for the life of me I can't remember the playing style to guide me, so I am sitting and watching that one. I do though agree somewhat with Mario's statement about RC getting bored being an indicative of a tell, but dont know if that is town or otherwise... again I dont particularly take a pre-supopsed tell as proof. Shadow is inmy scum list due to lack of content,  Anadog stays there based on the recent ramblings offered up, in all it  is a pretty slow game at the moment and I particularly do not like D1.

I just have to agree with Soap and myself on this one. its opportunistic voting on his part and his latest vote on Rory seems to be a sheep move.  I take on board the fact that Nos is L1 but I dont really see the reason for the lynch, never have done maybe I am just blind to the arguement.  I dont like Makara's current play and ask myself why he would not jump on Nos if he has a scum read albeit weak. he states that there is no strong counter wagon so parks his vote on Rory?  makes no sense.

Otherwise, I like much of what he's posting and it makes sense to me. Overall seems town-motivated.<br>\nsupercool898 - Same as Soapbar.

I'm from back in the day and this is my first forum mafia game here in about 2-3 years or something like that. I see some of you are newer to this game and for that I can forgive you for the tragedy of this game that we've called scumhunting. Honestly I'm just having a bit of trouble comprehending how we've come to this point without getting a scum lynch but Glork's weak modifier and him suiciding(or dying) is probably the reason. I don't see an SK being in this setup purely based off the behavior of people on my wagon and the fact that NL'ing didn't bring about a kill, especially on a claimed tracker. I'm fairly confident we're dealing with a 3-man scum team. That aside, it really doesn't matter. Town is guaranteed a loss if we don't lynch scum. I only went down that path based on Glork's death. If you're wanting to bounce walls with me, no. I hate bouncing walls between two people in a back and forth. It's bad. Keep your points clear and where everyone can read them please. This will be my longest post of the game because it's 29 pages of content condensed into one post. <br>\n<br>\nThere are going to be a literal fuckton of quotes in this post and it's going to clog up the page. Bear with me here. If you see quotations without an actual quote, I'm quoting the person I recently used quote tags for and am keeping this post as short as possible. I've already meta'd some of you to help with reads just because I'm not familiar with much of the newer playerbase post-2012. I'm not going to bring it up(meta can or cannot be literally fucking useless on a per-game basis and isn't reliable) but just wanted some experience with certain players' playstyles, scum and town. Let's get this shit started.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nRC is pretty town purely based on the non-RVS vote within 3 minutes of super posting. This first page was pretty quality in terms of RVS with super/RC. Uh-oh, Slandaar is bringing it into the theoretical. Bad. Not telling but not a good way to go for reads. Funny thing: you guys all are saying RVS could be infinite.

Super just doesn't understand why RC voted. You don't either, though, and just hopped on the wagon without understanding it.<br>\n<br>\nThe OMGUS vote isn't very telling that you mentioned two posts later or so. Town or scum can be aggressive towards someone voting them. <br>\n<br>\nAnd we have a fakevig. Cool. Soap's dumbtown. Super's likely newtown but I don't know yet. RC is pretty obvious already at 2 pages and I think everyone in the game knows it. <br>\n<br>\nCheck it out. <br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Soap wrote:</cite>I'm pretty sure RC was just reaction testing. Nothing about your RVS vote was particularly scummy to me.<br>\n<br>\nBut I can't speak for her.</div></blockquote><br>\nHe fakevigged in the next post. The next post after THIS. Noone posted between this, he double posted. I don't ever see scum gambitting with this. I'm very sure Soap is town. No scum in their right minds posts \"nothing about your RVS vote was particularly scummy to me\" then posts a fakevig. I just don't see it. If it's fake, I'm looking for some more hate and conviction. I feel really good about this. <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Soap wrote:</cite>Should I have kept it going longer? I didn't know lol. This is the first gambit I've ever done.</div></blockquote><br>\nYou shouldn't have done it at all. It was pretty dumb and didn't yield a lot of information. You should wait until you've played more games with more experienced players, some of the best on the site(Hoopla especially, if she's still around), and then you can consider gambitting. It doesn't always go well but this was a normal game so you have a bit more leeway over a theme, where you usually don't know anything about the roles in the game.<br>\n<br>\nDear God, Rory's omgus vote.

First post of the game and we're laying on a late rvs vote thanks to showing up late and....posting about a post of a post of a vote on yourself. It's just out of place. <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Super wrote:</cite>I am not getting good feelings about Firesong right now. Firesong, why are you suggesting it bad to place an RVS vote?</div></blockquote><br>\nHe's not. He's mad because he's been voted and feels the pressure I'm pretty sure. He just placed an RVS vote before that post you're responding to here.<br>\n<br>\nRight after, smudger posts. It wasn't a great post but wasn't particularly bad. At least he is clearly not placing rvs and not commenting on any part of the game, even if the post is minimal. <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Fire wrote:</cite>that was a naked vote</div></blockquote><br>\nI don't buy it. A vote without a reason posted has much more reason to it than an rvs vote. <br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Fire in the same post wrote:</cite>I'm not voting for him, but I'll be paying close attention to him.</div></blockquote>Very wishy-washy.<br>\n<br>\n\"Too many townreads too soon\"<br>\nRC PLS. <br>\n<br>\nSuper's unvote immediately after is good vibes all around. <br>\n<br>\nThere's been a lot of lurking by half of the playerlist up to this point.

And plenty of those questions you love to eat and swallow up to never see the light of day again as a side order. Based on the \"goons\" or \"scum PR\". This is a closed setup as far as I'm aware but the paid attention to that last part in bold sends bad vibes all the way. I just don't like it. Burn it with fire and make it dead. <br>\n<br>\nI'm done with this for now because I did this ISO to compare his later-game playing and all these posts are within a 30 minute span but didn't sit well with me. I'm going to his later game play for my comparison I wanted to do. Note-worthy of this ISO: Firesong pays very good attention to VT vs PR discussions and shows very good knowledge of the game and what you should/shouldn't be doing throughout the day regarding them. He is also very careful when mentioning them. This same knowledge retroactively goes out the window in other posts not concerning the setup but concerning the game and what's going on in it. I do not like this. Ok, so I completed the ISO. All there is is just a \"you scored a townpoint\" to Soap. Nothing else since basically what I've quoted from early D1. Yeah, not good. No watching Soap more closely was done. Not D1. Not D2, not D3 but that can be excused. I have really bad gut feelings about it. Not scumhunting the whole game despite having scumreads, not having the vote on someone who's your only scumread, being so careful about where the vote is D1, posting about the PR's, the whole deal. Individual posts don't stand out but the big picture does and I think that's where the true tell is. <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>MM4 wrote:</cite>Everyone should vote for Soapbar.

He just expects you to address the fact that there was a fakevig earlier and it doesn't sit right with him. He didn't expect you to have actual reads but just felt it was odd you didn't comment on anything. This isn't a scumtell at all from Soap.<br>\n<br>\nThe annadog push from Glork is quality. I would've done the same thing. Rory makes sense. Not sure how that went through still. <br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Glork wrote:</cite>When you get called out for lurking, come into a 7 page thread, and merely state that you think one person is town, that's called active lurking. .And it's a tried and true scumtell.</div></blockquote>The trolling actually killed his push which sucks. Post-game this needs to be paid attention to in case of troll. <br>\n<br>\nMM4 is consistent with his thoughts. This town is very on track. Activity must have fallen off and lead everyone astray because this is really good so far. I'm skimming ahead to Day 2 here on a hunch. I think I saw something when skimming that's important. <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Slandaar wrote:</cite>Smudger originally says he thinks the crumb is dependent on the D1 lynch (which means it doesn't incriminate him) - makes sense.<br>\n<br>\nLater he says he thought Glork said Rory today, Smudger tomorrow.

Stick to the scum vs town argument. <br>\n<br>\nRC could've done slightly better but didn't read into everything too much. The null reads and nothing strong is unfortunate. I keep looking at super's posts and nothing sticks out to me. Nothing especially town but certainly nothing scum. Everyone's associating his alignment directly with Soap's and I'm trying not to let that affect my read on him but I just get a gut town feeling from the slot. <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Nos wrote:</cite>waiting for his response to this.

This is exactly what I meant by individual posts but the bigger picture. I agreed with this. When I looked in post 56 to see what you meant, I realized it was perfectly acceptable to place that vote after a fakevig. In fact, RVS was fine simply because there were so many lurkers in the game up to that point and he had contributed and may not have had a scumread at the time. This focus, which anyone such as yourself would see and should have the sense and understanding to comprehend(I mentioned your mafia knowledge earlier), is why this feels so fake to me. You should know better. You even linked each post so I know that you read them yet you pursued this knowing the context. You not able to decipher this same context and pushing this on weak grounds is reaching for a scumhunting case on town. I can't place it any better than this right here.<br>\n<br>\nSmudger is really just posting too much without saying a lot.

It was the knowledge of mafia you've shown to this point that makes that so scummy. You definitely knew a vig wasn't a possibility but introduced it regardless just to play the role. <br>\n<br>\nAt this point you guys should have abandoned the Glork speculation. There's too much WIFOM and not enough fact. The only way I see a Glork crumb is if he has capitalized a letter of the post to spell out a name and it's in the set of posts leading up to the night.

I don't like that Slandaar died N2 when he was the one who disliked Maxous. MM4's intent to hammer doesn't feel good at all. I don't like it. It's out of nowhere, avoids the current discussion, and is preempted. There's no need to rush that day.

I'm sad that went through. <br>\n<br>\nAlright, so here's D3. Considering there's only 4 pages from here to where I replaced in, this is going to get juicy. It's time to blow this game wide open. It's interesting MM and Maxous post here. Scum lost daytalk at this point, though, so never mind what I'm saying. If they had day talk, I assumed they wouldn't have posted. Look at Ari's first post D2. It's a vote on Makara despite Makara not being a hugely popular wagon before and I'm assuming their tracker claim was made with this in mind in order to give it some credibility. In other words, it was pre-planned. This is likely because scum had daytalk at this time. <br>\n<br>\nMM rushes out the door with a Max vote. Max says we probably shouldn't lynch. This is interesting because this scum tracker claim was pre-planned. Would scum wait before voting for him to post it? Would they say \"hey we shouldn't lynch today, let's NL\"? This is WIFOM but an interesting thing just to keep in mind. It won't help you with tells though. I would re-read this page. Page 25 for anyone interested.

Unfortunately from what I understand, the bodyguard is multiple-use and the bulletproof isn't. Makara should have been using it often as he could've confirmed himself and someone else as town at the same time or gambitted with some other things but let's not get into that right now. This ended up helping the game get to where it is now with a lot of town dead but the lynches are the real enemy here. Makara may not have used it specifically because he thought he would die. The role PM is worded such that it looks like you die if you successfully protect someone and it negates the 1-shot BP. When I asked the mod for clarification however, the 1-shot BP is used if you successfully protect someone and you don't die. I doubt Makara clarified this with the mod either and that's a big mistake that's on him.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>MM4 wrote:</cite>I don't believe makara knows what a 1-Shot Bulletproof Bodyguard does, and having saw both PR flips stuck together a modifier and a random role.<br>\nIt makes sense we'd have at least one Investigative role and Tracker makes more sense than Bodyguard; both flipped PRs deal with death.</div></blockquote><br>\nThe first line there should be more indicative of why Makara wouldn't have used it and that Makara was town, not scum. The second line is speculation and I'd rather not get into that game. You could say the same about having at least one protective role assuming a vig and a scumteam, now couldn't you? This is a protective vs. investigative point and isn't alignment-telling at all.<br>\n<br>\nAristo claiming this information on Day 3 instead of Day 2 is all sorts of bad. Town wouldn't do that and would hope there would be a protective role, moreso with two town members dying on N1 instead of just one. I can maybe seeing the wait it out option with one flip but two flips is where you call it too many and abort mission. This is a gambit if I've ever seen it, especially with the early vote being placed on D2. This shit was premeditated in the scum QT. <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>makara wrote:</cite>Here's what my role does. If I get shot once, I do not die. If I protect a player, and they are shot, they die instead of me.</div></blockquote>Dammit. Yeah, so makara thought that he would die if he successfully protected someone and didn't inquire at all about the 1-shot BP. This is SO DAMN BAD AND CRINGE. The dead town QT must seriously hate this game. <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>super wrote:</cite>With his setup, he would be able to survive one blow given to either himself or his targeted player, but makara doesn't even realize he can survive one diverted night kill if he protects someone. </div></blockquote><br>\nDAMMIT SUPER.

Don't tell me you \"won this ez\" because a newer player didn't understand his role PM and didn't clarify it as soon as he entered the game in D1. For what it's worth, makara's #667 is exactly word-for-word true as to what this role pm says. It's pretty ambiguous on the subject of the 1-shot BP and the bodyguard interacting. #673 is pretty much exactly what I feared.

Voted makara D1.<br>\n-Makara claims 1shot bp bodyguard, no actions up to here.<br>\n-Wagons get to L-2, luckily noone was dumb enough for L-1<br>\n-Soap switches back to NL and turns D3 back towards it<br>\n-Aristo gets an \"epiphany\" and realizes NL is great. No. Lynching caught scum D2 and hoping for a protective PR was great.<br>\n-So what happens N3?<br>\n-Scum take my 1-shot BP because lulz and they tricked you all. Noone even thinks about this or that this happened, either. That's what really baffles me. <br>\n-You've all been taken into the backstage and gone for the cake but it was a lie. A dirty lie. There are not two investigative roles that are almost the same.<br>\n<br>\nAnd you know what? Right now, I'm pretty pissed. N3 was bullshit; I just wished I replaced in D3. Scum wouldn't want to make a kill regardless with a NL. If they do, everyone's reads may change by process of elimination. If this guy was a tracker, there's probably an RB. He would get no result regardless. But he's not so I don't even care about that speculation. You need to think about this.<div style=\"display:inline-flex;text-decoration:line-through\">There is no strongman. No. There is not. I refuse to believe it. Why? Because I'm a 1-shot BP.</div> Actually maybe there is. I don't know. That would be even more evidence towards this guy being scum, though. This is seriously black and white. We are not NL'ing today.

An investigative with a vig is already strong. <br>\n<br>\nNot to mention your role is the ONLY one without a modifier.

I didn't know about Maxous. I still and probably always will think Super/Soap town. But now Fire is either bad scum or bad town. Bad town for the SK idea and voting someone on that basis. Bad scum because you should be bussing your buddy in this situation when he's going down.

Because, in all honesty, I think Fire could be town.

You've unvoted aristo because \"aristo never gave up as scum before\". He never did the same as town either. He's also never played with me before. Fire's voting me because \"I looked over his meta and he plays like this as scum\". I mean, I usually expect people to link the games or quote the posts they use for the meta <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">at the least</div> but that hasn't happened here. Not to mention that meta is garbage unless you're extremely familiar with a player and know their personality. I warned people about using meta in my replace-in post. It's not reliable. You'll learn. <br>\n<br>\nLike I said, I'm not giving out free passes with all the bullshit anymore. Aristo has officially given up at this game. He knows he can't lynch me and he's afraid of outing his partners. If you can't see that by now and you're town, that's your problem because you aren't as good at this game as you think you are. Anyone defending Aristo when he isn't even TRYING is now seen as scummy and that includes you. No more VI cards. I can't do a double VI situation. When people give up, that's anti-town no matter how you look at it. Town won't do it because that's against their wincon. They want a scum lynch and will do anything to prevent a mislynch in MYLO. Scum do it only if it plays to their advantage i.e. there's no hope, they don't feel in the game, and they can hurt their chances at winning by producing content and posting more. This has LONG been a discussion that's over. This guy has scumclaimed in thread about 3 times with his bullshit posts. And he's been defended. By you and Fire. For no reason. You don't know his alignment. Don't tell me you fucking do. Not unless you're his scumbuddy. Because I know he's scum thanks to his claim on me. I KNOW he's scum. I KNOW my push is in the right place. Yet you've chainsaw defended him because \"paranoia\" and \"lol meta\". NOPE. This is done. If you're town, you're playing like retards by defending him. Town lets people present their points and debate it out. It produces content. Defending someone who REFUSES to defend themselves is not something town does. If you're scum, you're playing against your wincon and outing yourself as his buddies in the most obvious fashion possible.<br>\n<br>\nThis is an argument that shouldn't have to be made.", "time": "Thu Nov 12, 2015 6:38 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=63625&start=875", "forum": "53", "thread": "63625"}

You think that Aristo/Hindu are sk/scum. And Ariso of course, being the sk and incapable of resisting a high profile, decides to fake claim tracker guilty on makara, who happens to be scum. Makara of course fake claims bodyguard, all as a scum tactic to get a counterlynch on Aristo, instead of hey, just saying that he's full of shit and saying he didn't go anywhere. This same sk, aristo, who can't resist the spotlight, evidenced by his desire to boldly claim tracker during MyLo, also happened to NOT KILL ONCE THE ENTIRE FUCKING GAME.

Based on my interactions with Nos yesterday, she's fairly obvtown. At this point, EVERYONE expresses desire for Fire to hang. What does this mean? Fire's scum? Maybe. You can't be very sure but it's likely that she's not scum based entirely off that small mini-point. The only person who doesn't want to vote Fire is super and I'm pretty sure he's scum now. Honestly I think he's a better lynch than Fire. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">I think super is a FANTASTIC lynch</div>. That post he made was scummy as shit while he tried his best to look like he was being helpful and failed. And a Nos lynch is honestly a bit laughable after all of that if you ask me. Fire's reaction to that pressure was indeed scummy though because it was the first time any pressure was on her for a lynch and she unvoted...going \"unsure\". lel.

When I first sided with aristo, it was because of makara's lack of knowledge on his role that made me believe he was fake claiming, but I then became a little unsure about my read and then justified it by how aristo voted makara on his first post (as seen in post 709).<br>\n<br>\nWhen Hindu replaced in and argued that scum had daychat on D-2, I realized that the plan could have been made then allowing him to make a fake crumb. Since my belief of aristo's claim was anchored by that one point, I no longer had my proof that aristo was tracker and with the combination of hindu's points and townie feel, I decided to support him over aristo. My points are backed up in post 736.<br>\n<br>\nIn my post 736, I also mention that I didn't want to bring him to L-1 since then he could hammer himself and keep us from talking (I had that happen in my first game, so I was wary this time) but then fire got on anyway and I wasn't able to cast my vote without hammering aristo. I also didn't realize until after you voted aristo that his wasn't at L-1 anymore (as seen in post 896) and voted him afterward. So, as we can see I did not quietly slide onto aristo's wagon but instead was supporting Hindu.<br>\n<br>\nIn response to you saying that I was passive and quiet, I think these complaints mainly (if not only) apply to today. I have been quiet for most of today since not many people have been talking today, and I was more quiet yesterday since I was agreeing with what most people were saying and didn't want to clog up the thread repeating what everybody else had already said.<br>\n<br>\nAs for being passive, I have only been passive today.
