The fact that she got an avatar is actually a newb move in my eyes.

I'm also liking BananaCucho so far. CD has been fairly \"sheepy\", and I didn't make much of that initially, but rereading, it's slightly ticking me off. TheWorst is null so far, but his recent posts have been better than his posts at the beggining of the game. I read SamX null so far, I didn't like her wagon, her posts were awkward, yes, but not really scummy. That said, I'd appreciate if she could give some input on what has happened so far. I would also like to hear more input in general, and more sensical input from Bacde.<br>\n<br>\nNothing else really stands out so far.", "time": "Fri Aug 07, 2015 5:09 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=62909&start=100", "forum": "53", "thread": "62909"}

But the reason he gave for his vote on TheWorst was incorrect. Could have been a hasty post while he was playing Fallout 4? Idk. It demands a Lot of benefit of doubt to overlook this behavior, but something is not right with him. Like claiming that his style of play doesn't get him night killed, and not mentioning his reasons for voting or reading someone has scum / town. Just seems fishy to me. So, I think I will just keep my vote on him.<br>\n<br>\nWorst case is that, he is town and my suspicion on him is misplaced. But if that avoids him from being night killed,  and he is able to win us the game in the end, then its actually a good thing, no? Also, If he is town, then his strategy is pretty cool, because it is a win win for us.

Honestly this feels like you knowing and accepting that a Fire lynch isn't happening, so you decide to jump off the wagon as well for...

Look at this guys ISO.  Its full of posts saying that the Firebringer wagon is terrible and that Fire is a terribad town.  Only one post really with anything worthwhile, but not much is substantiated.  He seems very confident in that Fire is a bad town and that people shouldn't vote him aka defending Fire hardcore.  As a scum player it would make sense to try to pocket a terrible player who you knew was a terrible townie.<br>\n<br>\nI'm not done with Fire yet, no way. But seeing how somehow he's getting away with this shit and it doesn't seem he will be lynched, I can compromise for a Salamance lynch and MAYBE Eventi - its important for us to get a lynch off and those are my #2 and #3 scumreads behind Fire.  Any other wagon is going to need a lot of convincing at this point.<br>\n<br>\nI gotta say, the motivation to continue trying in this game is pretty much gone.

Could just be their playstyle; idk.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Her response to your question</div> (<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7123140#p7123140\" class=\"postlink\">#90</a>):<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: for TheWorst</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\">Btw, as a side note, looking back at the questions you raised on everyone (which I felt was sporadic then, mainly because of my FoS on you), I feel you were right in thinking that they would increase discussion and participation. In retrospect, its actually a good idea because we end up referencing people's responses to those questions, so my bad on that call. (<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">FoS lessens to igmeou</div>)</div></div></div><br>\nHer views about SamX is something that is similar to mine; that is, I find her behavior a bit suspicious. But unlike Klingon's reluctance to vote first timers; I feel that suspicious newbies are BWCS lynch candidates, and that if we don't find any decent lynch candidates then we should look at them. I feel that way because, newbies behave differently. And I know this from experience, as when I first played mafia I couldn't understand why people expected me to be scum or how easy a target I was for scums to frame.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Non committal behavior wrt to votes</div> (<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7123162#p7123162\" class=\"postlink\">#93</a>, 94, 165, <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7126311#p7126311\" class=\"postlink\">180</a>, 181, 205):<br>\n<br>\nShe seems a bit lethargic on finding scum, and says that she knows four players by post #93, and have no reads on any of them. Then she says that she will look at Bacde and Cthulhu in post #94. <br>\n<br>\nI feel this is scummy as she seems disinterested in scum hunting and just name drops two people as an anchor post? <br>\n<br>\nWhat is more scummy is her next post (<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7125807#p7125807\" class=\"postlink\">165</a>), where she asks Cthulhu to get well soon and hops in the wagon on Firebringer <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":?\" title=\"Confused\"> <br>\nI mean, she said she will look at Bacde and Cthulhu. Then completely ignores mentioning them, and votes for Firebringer who was appearing a lot scummy by that time. <br>\n<br>\nHer next two posts are derps and then she unvotes Firebringer immediately after he claims vanilla town (<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7128468#p7128468\" class=\"postlink\">#205</a>). It is as though she knows he is Vanilla town for sure, or they both are scum and she voted on him earlier to avoid being suspected as his scum partner?<br>\n<br>\nI asked about her immediate unvote, but she answered all my questions other than that one (<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7128627#p7128627\" class=\"postlink\">#216</a>). Coming to think of it, I was distracted by Firebringer's posts and the Meta references that were being made about hammering early. I mean, intimidating fellow townies is not something that I can see a townie doing, and neither could I understand hammering early being a protown strategy. Those two points were quite disturbing for me, and I don't understand then still.<br>\n<br>\nAnyways <a href=\"/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;un=Klingoncelt\" class=\"postlink\">Klingoncelt</a>, now that I found that question again, could you answer why you believed Firebringer's claim immediately?<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote on me, Meta references, Helping out users</div> (<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7128560#p7128560\" class=\"postlink\">#213</a>, 214, <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7128753#p7128753\" class=\"postlink\">221</a>, 222, <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7129040#p7129040\" class=\"postlink\">229</a>, 230):<br>\n<br>\nI feel that Klingoncelt's vote on me seems to be a pressure vote, since the only reason she mentioned was me going under the radar. Which was never my intention, so it didn't bother me at all.<br>\n<br>\nThen she tells about Ika and Boonskiies; idk about them, so its quite confusing when players refer to other people's play styles who are not in the game, and don't give an explanation as to why they are referring to their play styles. I did ask her about this in the following posts and the discussion goes into hammering at L-1 or L-2. She then says that it is not alignment indicative, which I don't get at all. I think it is scummy to do that, because we need as much time as we can get to discuss about as many players as we can. Imo, atleast half the players should be discussed about, on each day, so that we can at least nab one scum before day 3. <br>\n<br>\nHer helping me about the Meta of early hammering and explaining what Meta meant to SamX makes me think that she is a helpful townie, but her supporting Firebringer's attitude, makes me suspect her too. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Reply to TheWorst, Salamence and Firebringer</div> (<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7132018#p7132018\" class=\"postlink\">#241</a>, 292, <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7135108#p7135108\" class=\"postlink\">#293</a>, 296):<br>\n<br>\nIn post #241 she says that her reasons for not contributing much is because she is in 10 games and has some RL stuff to do, and would contribute more before deadline. <br>\n<br>\nShe then posts a weird thing in #293, \"Gale's V/LA until Saturday, so I guess there won't be much contributing.\" Idk what she means by that. What has her contribution got to do with my being on V/LA? She can obviously ask whatever questions she has in mind and I would reply when I am back. I even asked if anyone has any questions for me after I was back from V/LA and she didn't ask anything. <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":?\" title=\"Confused\"> <br>\n<br>\nShe then answers Firebringer that he has been ignoring Banana. And soon after her post, Firebringer wants to focus on Banana (<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7138006#p7138006\" class=\"postlink\">#306</a>). Which is extremely suspicious, there is something going on between the two for sure.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Reads list and vote on Salamence</div> (<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7140469#p7140469\" class=\"postlink\">#323</a>, 324, <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7143661#p7143661\" class=\"postlink\">#347</a>, <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7145486#p7145486\" class=\"postlink\">#386</a>):<br>\n<br>\nShe promises a reads list and then shares it, which is good, but her read list is blunt. As in, there are no reasons mentioned for her reads. Although, its better for us to have a reads list in the first place, but a blunt one only creates more questions than it answers. <br>\n<br>\nAnd then when she was questioned by Duppin on why she feels that Salamence is scummy, she responds in post #386 that 'Not giving any reasoning at all makes it easier to avoid scumslips - and scrutiny after a mislynch.'<br>\n<br>\nIsn't she doing the same thing with her reads list? <br>\n<br>\nImo, having a different opinion is not wrong but her vote on Salamence just came out of nowhere. While she was reading me and Bacde as scum already. I mean why not keep the vote on me or vote for Bacde instead?  <br>\n<br>\nI feel that her vote shift from me to Salamence, and her reasons for the shift don't make sense. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Asking to decide on a Lynch target and to move away from Firebringer</div> (<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7151108#p7151108\" class=\"postlink\">#422</a>, 424, <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7151251#p7151251\" class=\"postlink\">#428</a>):<br>\n<br>\nIdg this one either *sigh*<br>\n<br>\nIt seems her posts are more like IIOA, especially post #422. And then in post #424, she asks Banana to vote for Salamence or Eventi, and starts getting friendly with Juckter's replacement. <br>\n<br>\nIdk, it seems as though she is interested in getting people to follow her? It is good to be helpful but she seems too helpful and something about her doesn't fit right with me.<br>\n<br>\nTl;dr I think Klingoncelt is <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">mostly scum</div>. Her interactions with Firebringer, her trying to direct people away from the wagon rather than discussing it in the first place means that she is reluctant on lynching him fsr. Then voting for Salamence for doing the same thing as what she is doing (Not giving reasons for reads and such), and asking others to follow the Salamence or Eventi wagon; all seem scum tells for me.<br>\n<br>\nIf I was not voting for Firebringer, then I think I would vote for Klingoncelt instead.

Firebringer was the one who claimed Vanilla town, and as you mentioned claiming Vanilla town is counter productive (unless mass claim), because it helps the scums to find the PRs and also makes you an easy lynch target.<br>\n<br>\nFsr, I don't trust Firebringer's claim, and I also don't like the fact that our Cop was made to claim in all this chaos. Probably if this ruckus hadn't happened Salamence might have stayed quite about his role? <br>\n<br>\nIts also easy to verify Salamence's claim than to verify Firebringer's. Since either we have to inspect him or wait till he is night killed. Although, tbh this whole 'I won't be night killed because of my strategy' seems fishy to me. Since, he could very well be scum and not be night killed too? <br>\n<br>\nFuck this sh8, instead of making it easier to find scum, everything that Firebringer does is making it harder to find scum. Unless we follow him, which I am not sure whether he is busing or not.

I am not saying that you shouldn't have unvoted, but you didn't reason it for one bit. Instead immediately accepted it as though you wanted to accept it, like lynching him would be a bad thing for you (Personally). <br>\n<br>\nNo one had mentioned an intention to hammer, except for SamX's fleeting question to end the day early. I didn't see any reason for you to unvote immediately, and I think that you were trying to vote him to make sure that both of you are not connected together. But when you saw that he was at L-1 and was at the risk of getting lynched, you panicked and decided to unvote him?<br>\n<br>\nRegardless of Firebringer's alignment, this is extremely scummy. Because you could have voted for a town Firebringer, and saw that your scum buddy had voted for him too, and didn't want to be mapped along with your scum buddy so you unvoted the first chance you got?<br>\n<br>\nAnd if Firebringer is scum, then your unvote is suspicious too as you wouldn't want your scum buddy to be lynched because of your vote on him? <br>\n<br>\nWhatever is your reason to unvote him, it definitely doesn't seem like the one you mentioned.

But why do you think I should be defending myself?). I just stated what I felt. I shouldn't have listened to you, and that is my fault. I didn't blame you for going after Eventi, but I am blaming myself for voting for someone who I didn't think was as scummy as my top scum reads. Also, I should have probably tried to reason with you guys into voting for Klingoncelt or Firebringer instead. Imo, I took too much time rereading and was so confused by the end of day that I decided to get us a lynch rather than thinking if that Lynch is good for us.<br>\n<br>\nTbh, I am only mad at you for pressuring me into doing what you felt was the right play for me at that time. Like you literally made me feel that I am not good enough for the game, and I should sub out so that someone else can continue the game. Its a bit humiliating don't you think? I am learning the game, and I don't know everything. Assuming that I know everything, you said that I am not good enough to play the game, I didn't like that at all. I was just under the impression that it is a plurality vote rather than a majority (the newbie game I was in was hammered quickly so I didn't face the near deadline scenario before). And what made me more mad was that Eventi was trying to help me even at that time and I ignored it too. I am kind of still depressed about my play right now, and its not helping that you guys are targeting me for reacting to the flips.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7165063#p7165063\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7165063#p7165063\" data-post-id=\"7165063\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 604</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=24731\">Klingoncelt</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7165007#p7165007\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7165007#p7165007\" data-post-id=\"7165007\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 600</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=14358\">Salamence20</a> wrote:</cite>Anyone have any thoughts on Gale's redirection to me as a basis to defend himself?</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nGale's play today is creeping me out.<br>\n<br>\nHe's gone from total noob mode to posting like an IC in a noob game to deciding he's figured out the Scumteam at the start of Day2. <br>\n<br>\nI don't like telling noobs to shut up and sit down while the big kids talk, but as long as you're acting so skeevy, Gale, you need to take a back seat and see how it's done.<br>\n<br>\nIf you come up with some actual useful information, then post it.</div></blockquote><br>\nI don't understand <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">total noob mode and posting like an IC in a noob game</div>.

I know that mislynch is a probable result on Day 1, but what I am not able to digest is running with Whims and fancies of players, without actually analyzing stuff.<br>\n<br>\nI am not saying that your gut feeling is always wrong, but after you share your gut feelings and the posts that made you get those feelings, we should analyze those posts and see if most people agree to what you are saying. I can only talk about myself here, and the posts that you felt eventi was scummy (<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7153766#p7153766\" class=\"postlink\">#463</a>) were not ringing any alarm bells in my head. Although, I did find him scummy for <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7135712#p7135712\" class=\"postlink\">#298</a>; but it wasn't as scummy as Klingoncelt's posts.  <br>\n<br>\nImo, with the Eventi read. You just took after him for scummy behavior, instead of trying to actually find out if he is scum. I am not sure if that strategy works, but what I have found is people just get defensive and give clumsy reactions like Ciara is giving to Bacde. Instead if we ask Ciara questions about the game, about the flips, her reads, her thoughts about different players then we will get a better picture of whether she is scum or not, don't you think?<br>\n<br>\nAlso, I feel that when we go after people (without solid info), we need to have some sort of rating as to how much scummy we feel that player is. Like if I were to rate Klingoncelt for scumminess then I would rate her as 80:20, and for Firebringer I would rate him as 70:30. Since, it will give us a better picture of how strong our gut feeling is, for that player to be actually scum.", "time": "Fri Aug 21, 2015 5:34 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=62909&start=600", "forum": "53", "thread": "62909"}

As much as I want Fire lynched, its not happening at the moment.  He's got too many chums in this game that won't let it happen.  Reminds me of my last game (my only other game on the site so far, a newbie game) that just ended.  I called out the IC for something I felt was scummy on day 1 but couldn't get anyone to join the wagon.  Did the same thing day 2 and no one would join.  Finally in LYLO day 4 they were lynched (were scum) and town won.  I'm only one vote and even though its not happening now, Fire WILL hang and people will facepalm when they see him flip scum and go free for so long.  Maybe when his scum pal is lynched we can associate them.<br>\n<br>\nYour \"depressed\" post felt forced and that's why I am willing to support a wagon on you.

I didn't blame you for going after Eventi, but I am blaming myself for voting for someone who I didn't think was as scummy as my top scum reads.

This means that either Eventi dies or we no lynch, which is not good here (No lynching is anti-town here on Mafiascum). Also you didn't listen to me by not rereading during the night. Why not?

I am learning the game, and I don't know everything. Assuming that I know everything, you said that I am not good enough to play the game, I didn't like that at all. I was just under the impression that it is a plurality vote rather than a majority (the newbie game I was in was hammered quickly so I didn't face the near deadline scenario before). And what made me more mad was that Eventi was trying to help me even at that time and I ignored it too. I am kind of still depressed about my play right now, and its not helping that you guys are targeting me for reacting to the flips.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nWell you obviously made some noob mistakes.

And we are stuck in traffic Houston!<br>\n<br>\nIts actually distracting us from a solid direction, and frustrating me even further. Would someone start making someone talk with some sense around here already? Seriously, till Ciara would be back we could have got someone to talk seriously and made use of our time, but No NO nO No NO. Everyone is happy waiting for Ciara, and for god's sake Bacde stop rotating between Lets lynch Ciara, wait till her V/LA ends, and Lets lynch Ciara. Its definitely confusing everyone. <br>\n<br>\nAnd also answer my questions! You are adding up to my frustration really. Ask Firebringer a question and he vanishes, ask Bacde a question and he doesn't respond, ask Constantine to read and he trolls, give Duppin a punch and he is TKO'd somewhere.

But for the sake of his final words, and also based on his determined wagon analysis, I would like us to vote for Firebringer or Klingoncelt. <br>\n<br>\nSurely one of them is definitely scum, if they end up winning this game despite being on all the wagons (<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7155039#p7155039\" class=\"postlink\">eventi</a>, <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7169996#p7169996\" class=\"postlink\">Ciara</a>, <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7190718#p7190718\" class=\"postlink\">Salamence</a>) then its even more humiliating. Also, I am assuming scum blitz means town losing without catching a single scum? And Banana, why do you think we are in LYLO? <br>\n<br>\nBetween eventi, Ciara and Salamence I think we had a diverse set of lynches to confirm that there might not be a four player scum team, or we could have got atleast one scum between them. Although, I am not sure why we can't have a two player scum team.<br>\n<br>\nBut regardless of how big the scum team is, these two were too friendly on day 1. I know that Kling explained that she knows Fire from a different forum, but even then it seems weird to not suspect each other a little on Day 1. Especially, when one of the two was glowing scum for most of day 1.<br>\n<br>\n<div align=\"center\"><hr style=\"height:14px;width:100%\"></div>Now for some responses:<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Banana's accusation of me being scum along with Duppin.</div><br>\n<br>\nThis started with <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7179186#p7179186\" class=\"postlink\">#935</a>. Where I mentioned, \"Duppin is now going for Klingoncelt\" in my post. <br>\n<br>\nNow Kling read it as though I am saying Duppin is going after her right now, and afaik she joked about me mixing the game thread with the QT thread that the scums get. I still clarified it, because I saw that Kling was seriously responding to Banana. But let me clearly point out why this claim makes little sense. <br>\n<br>\n1) I assume that the phrase, \"now going for\" means two things in this context. One is the literal meaning that Klingon took from it, and the other is the figurative meaning where it means that Duppin's latest target is/was Klingon.<br>\n<br>\n2) If you assume the literal meaning of the phrase, just like Klingon did; then it should mean that Duppin had recently posted somewhere (either in the game thread or in the scum thread). I have learned that the scums can only have access to this thread during the night cycle, just as we have access to the game during the day cycle. And Day 3 had started at <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7176026#p7176026\" class=\"postlink\">#811</a>, which was quite a while back. <br>\n<br>\nIdk what else you guys want me to say about this, it is clear that I was reading his ISO and posted my analysis on why Duppin appears to be scummy based on, off wagon analysis. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Regarding Mass Claims:</div><br>\n<br>\nIf we are sure that we are in LYLO, then I support the Idea of Mass claim. I will check back later in the day, and I expect you guys to think about who and why we are lynching. <br>\n<br>\nTbqh, I am as lost as you guys are, since some of the plays make no sense. The ones I read as scum behave sometimes as town, and the ones I read as town are behaving as scum.

(What's it called, friends and enemies? I'm not well-versed in opens.) Most of the time, when players claim mason, they are taken at face value. Because that's what site meta is. A player doubting masons never enters the minds of a moderator or setup reviewer, because it's something we just never see. And for good reason--if a mason were to be lynched, then their partner gets killed off, making most people not want to lynch masons; if a scum fakeclaiming mason gets lynched, their scumbuddy gets lynched too which in a smaller game especially is VERY bad for them, and too large a risk 95% of the time. (Especially since there's a risk of real masons existing. Like in one of the mason fakeclaim examples above: scum claimed masons, were counterclaimed by the actual masons, actual mason got lynched...and was a venge-mason, killing the fakeclaiming mason.)", "time": "Sat Sep 05, 2015 9:52 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=62909&start=1500", "forum": "53", "thread": "62909"}

Any scum team could claim masons. It is not a good role.</div></blockquote> You hold this stance now, but with experience, you will realize that on mafiascum, masons means masons.<br>\n<br>\nOutside of players like kuribo, Fate, and DGB (I think they're responsible for the only two mason fakeclaims ever, and both times in a theme game where it backfired stupendously), there's basically never been a mason fakeclaim by scum except in an open setup specifically designed for that. (What's it called, friends and enemies? I'm not well-versed in opens.) Most of the time, when players claim mason, they are taken at face value. Because that's what site meta is. A player doubting masons never enters the minds of a moderator or setup reviewer, because it's something we just never see. And for good reason--if a mason were to be lynched, then their partner gets killed off, making most people not want to lynch masons; if a scum fakeclaiming mason gets lynched, their scumbuddy gets lynched too which in a smaller game especially is VERY bad for them, and too large a risk 95% of the time. (Especially since there's a risk of real masons existing. Like in one of the mason fakeclaim examples above: scum claimed masons, were counterclaimed by the actual masons, actual mason got lynched...and was a venge-mason, killing the fakeclaiming mason.)</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nIt's worse than that. DGB and I *counterclaimed* masons as scum, and though they were lovers, they were also vengeful. They shot DGB, and I was left to die by lynch the next day <br>\n<br>\nWe did once fake masons with a random player as town, (me + DGB + Fate in the original Serene) but that was less of a strategy and more like LOLSerene. We contemplated the fact that we had done that, considering the three of us were pretty much the people that were known to have fake claimed masons <br>\n<br>\nI'm fairly certain DGB once got away with it and I know for a fact Fate did, but it takes a certain amount of charisma to pull it off. And even with charisma, it's tough", "time": "Mon Sep 07, 2015 3:51 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=62909&start=1500", "forum": "53", "thread": "62909"}
