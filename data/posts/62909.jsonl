When that doesn't take off, you jump on a SamX wagon after that starts building.  I'm telling you what it looks like on the surface.

I don't think SamX is lying, seems like her posting derived from frustration at the beggining of the game.<br><br>So right now I'm leaning town on Gale for analyzing and attempting to generate some discussion. I'm also liking BananaCucho so far. CD has been fairly \"sheepy\", and I didn't make much of that initially, but rereading, it's slightly ticking me off. TheWorst is null so far, but his recent posts have been better than his posts at the beggining of the game. I read SamX null so far, I didn't like her wagon, her posts were awkward, yes, but not really scummy. That said, I'd appreciate if she could give some input on what has happened so far. I would also like to hear more input in general, and more sensical input from Bacde.<br><br>Nothing else really stands out so far."}

That's what is happening.  What is unreasonable is you saying that I have no reasoning when I tell people to vote.  Why do you think I have no reasoning?  Also why do you think I can make everyone do what I want?  I clearly can't.  If I could, ciara would be lynched by now.</div></blockquote><br><br>I think you don't have much reasoning because you don't explain your votes. I agree, it is very reasonable for town to work together and trust each other, but your argument isn't strong. I'm not convinced, at all. It's like when people tell you not to follow a friend that's jumping off a cliff (with death and horror at the bottom of it) for fun. Maybe if you told and proved to me there would be snacks and rainbows and unicorns or whatever at the bottom of the cliff. (Bad analogy but I tried)</div></blockquote><br>If a friend I knew and trusted and knew to not be suicidal jumped off a cliff, I would be much more open to jumping off that cliff.<br><br>No matter what I say will not fix your paranioa SamX, if I talked about why all it does is give you an opportunity to be like \"ok I see your reasoning but I disagree\" or stupid shit like that<br><br>You can either follow me or not, but Ciari is scum"}

But the reason he gave for his vote on TheWorst was incorrect. Could have been a hasty post while he was playing Fallout 4? Idk. It demands a Lot of benefit of doubt to overlook this behavior, but something is not right with him. Like claiming that his style of play doesn't get him night killed, and not mentioning his reasons for voting or reading someone has scum / town. Just seems fishy to me. So, I think I will just keep my vote on him.<br><br>Worst case is that, he is town and my suspicion on him is misplaced. But if that avoids him from being night killed,  and he is able to win us the game in the end, then its actually a good thing, no? Also, If he is town, then his strategy is pretty cool, because it is a win win for us. I just hope he nails scums though.<br><br><div align=\"center\"><hr style=\"height:14px; width:100%\"></div><br>Well other than Firebringer, I was thinking about another way to hunt scum. And I think in the three wagons that we have had thus far, we could look for a pattern of scum voting, or atleast deduce some relations between the wagons that would help us in the future.<br><br>These were the wagons at their prime: (I think I got them right, but if the host can confirm this then it would be great)<br><br>Cthulhu Dreaming (4)- TheWorst, Ciara24, SamX, Bacde<br>SamX (3) - Eventi, TheWorst, Cthlhu Dreaming<br>Firebringer (6)- juckter, BananaCucho, Klingoncelt, eventi, Gale Wing Srock, Salamence20 (L-1)<br><br>Other than TheWorst and Eventi, there is no repeat of votes between the wagon. <br><br>I have already mentioned that TheWorst's wagon hopping onto SamX's wagon (<span class=\"noboldsig\">with conviction</span>), and then immediately unvoting after hearing SamX's reason, seemed suspicious to me (<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7123199#p7123199\" class=\"postlink\">FoS on him</a>). <br><br>And, I am still looking through Eventi's posts, but as of now I have a town lean on him. Because of his suspicion on SamX for inconsistencies and scummy behavior, and his suspicion on Firebringer for vote hopping without proper reason sits well with me. <br><br>Will read through the rest of the posts and try to build on my reads list (its already too long for day one imo @_@), but I think I should stick with micro games for a while. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_skull.gif\" alt=\":dead:\" title=\"Death\">"}

Honestly this feels like you knowing and accepting that a Fire lynch isn't happening, so you decide to jump off the wagon as well for...

Look at this guys ISO.  Its full of posts saying that the Firebringer wagon is terrible and that Fire is a terribad town.  Only one post really with anything worthwhile, but not much is substantiated.  He seems very confident in that Fire is a bad town and that people shouldn't vote him aka defending Fire hardcore.  As a scum player it would make sense to try to pocket a terrible player who you knew was a terrible townie.<br><br>I'm not done with Fire yet, no way. But seeing how somehow he's getting away with this shit and it doesn't seem he will be lynched, I can compromise for a Salamance lynch and MAYBE Eventi - its important for us to get a lynch off and those are my #2 and #3 scumreads behind Fire.  Any other wagon is going to need a lot of convincing at this point.<br><br>I gotta say, the motivation to continue trying in this game is pretty much gone.  That may change once I'm back from vacation next week (I'll try to post in the evenings now) but this is one.  Really. Bad. Town."}

(<span class=\"noboldsig\">FoS lessens to igmeou</span>)</div></div></div><br>Her views about SamX is something that is similar to mine; that is, I find her behavior a bit suspicious. But unlike Klingon's reluctance to vote first timers; I feel that suspicious newbies are BWCS lynch candidates, and that if we don't find any decent lynch candidates then we should look at them. I feel that way because, newbies behave differently. And I know this from experience, as when I first played mafia I couldn't understand why people expected me to be scum or how easy a target I was for scums to frame.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Non committal behavior wrt to votes</span> (<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7123162#p7123162\" class=\"postlink\">#93</a>, 94, 165, <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7126311#p7126311\" class=\"postlink\">180</a>, 181, 205):<br><br>She seems a bit lethargic on finding scum, and says that she knows four players by post #93, and have no reads on any of them. Then she says that she will look at Bacde and Cthulhu in post #94. <br><br>I feel this is scummy as she seems disinterested in scum hunting and just name drops two people as an anchor post? <br><br>What is more scummy is her next post (<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7125807#p7125807\" class=\"postlink\">165</a>), where she asks Cthulhu to get well soon and hops in the wagon on Firebringer <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif\" alt=\":?\" title=\"Confused\"> <br>I mean, she said she will look at Bacde and Cthulhu. Then completely ignores mentioning them, and votes for Firebringer who was appearing a lot scummy by that time. <br><br>Her next two posts are derps and then she unvotes Firebringer immediately after he claims vanilla town (<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7128468#p7128468\" class=\"postlink\">#205</a>). It is as though she knows he is Vanilla town for sure, or they both are scum and she voted on him earlier to avoid being suspected as his scum partner?<br><br>I asked about her immediate unvote, but she answered all my questions other than that one (<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7128627#p7128627\" class=\"postlink\">#216</a>). Coming to think of it, I was distracted by Firebringer's posts and the Meta references that were being made about hammering early. I mean, intimidating fellow townies is not something that I can see a townie doing, and neither could I understand hammering early being a protown strategy. Those two points were quite disturbing for me, and I don't understand then still.<br><br>Anyways <a href=\"/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;un=Klingoncelt\" class=\"postlink\">Klingoncelt</a>, now that I found that question again, could you answer why you believed Firebringer's claim immediately?<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote on me, Meta references, Helping out users</span> (<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7128560#p7128560\" class=\"postlink\">#213</a>, 214, <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7128753#p7128753\" class=\"postlink\">221</a>, 222, <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7129040#p7129040\" class=\"postlink\">229</a>, 230):<br><br>I feel that Klingoncelt's vote on me seems to be a pressure vote, since the only reason she mentioned was me going under the radar. Which was never my intention, so it didn't bother me at all.<br><br>Then she tells about Ika and Boonskiies; idk about them, so its quite confusing when players refer to other people's play styles who are not in the game, and don't give an explanation as to why they are referring to their play styles. I did ask her about this in the following posts and the discussion goes into hammering at L-1 or L-2. She then says that it is not alignment indicative, which I don't get at all. I think it is scummy to do that, because we need as much time as we can get to discuss about as many players as we can. Imo, atleast half the players should be discussed about, on each day, so that we can at least nab one scum before day 3. <br><br>Her helping me about the Meta of early hammering and explaining what Meta meant to SamX makes me think that she is a helpful townie, but her supporting Firebringer's attitude, makes me suspect her too. <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Reply to TheWorst, Salamence and Firebringer</span> (<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7132018#p7132018\" class=\"postlink\">#241</a>, 292, <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7135108#p7135108\" class=\"postlink\">#293</a>, 296):<br><br>In post #241 she says that her reasons for not contributing much is because she is in 10 games and has some RL stuff to do, and would contribute more before deadline. <br><br>She then posts a weird thing in #293, \"Gale's V/LA until Saturday, so I guess there won't be much contributing.\" Idk what she means by that. What has her contribution got to do with my being on V/LA? She can obviously ask whatever questions she has in mind and I would reply when I am back. I even asked if anyone has any questions for me after I was back from V/LA and she didn't ask anything. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif\" alt=\":?\" title=\"Confused\"> <br><br>She then answers Firebringer that he has been ignoring Banana. And soon after her post, Firebringer wants to focus on Banana (<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7138006#p7138006\" class=\"postlink\">#306</a>). Which is extremely suspicious, there is something going on between the two for sure.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Reads list and vote on Salamence</span> (<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7140469#p7140469\" class=\"postlink\">#323</a>, 324, <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7143661#p7143661\" class=\"postlink\">#347</a>, <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7145486#p7145486\" class=\"postlink\">#386</a>):<br><br>She promises a reads list and then shares it, which is good, but her read list is blunt. As in, there are no reasons mentioned for her reads. Although, its better for us to have a reads list in the first place, but a blunt one only creates more questions than it answers. <br><br>And then when she was questioned by Duppin on why she feels that Salamence is scummy, she responds in post #386 that 'Not giving any reasoning at all makes it easier to avoid scumslips - and scrutiny after a mislynch.'<br><br>Isn't she doing the same thing with her reads list? <br><br>Imo, having a different opinion is not wrong but her vote on Salamence just came out of nowhere. While she was reading me and Bacde as scum already. I mean why not keep the vote on me or vote for Bacde instead?  <br><br>I feel that her vote shift from me to Salamence, and her reasons for the shift don't make sense. <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Asking to decide on a Lynch target and to move away from Firebringer</span> (<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7151108#p7151108\" class=\"postlink\">#422</a>, 424, <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7151251#p7151251\" class=\"postlink\">#428</a>):<br><br>Idg this one either *sigh*<br><br>It seems her posts are more like IIOA, especially post #422. And then in post #424, she asks Banana to vote for Salamence or Eventi, and starts getting friendly with Juckter's replacement. <br><br>Idk, it seems as though she is interested in getting people to follow her? It is good to be helpful but she seems too helpful and something about her doesn't fit right with me.<br><br>Tl;dr I think Klingoncelt is <span class=\"noboldsig\">mostly scum</span>. Her interactions with Firebringer, her trying to direct people away from the wagon rather than discussing it in the first place means that she is reluctant on lynching him fsr. Then voting for Salamence for doing the same thing as what she is doing (Not giving reasons for reads and such), and asking others to follow the Salamence or Eventi wagon; all seem scum tells for me.<br><br>If I was not voting for Firebringer, then I think I would vote for Klingoncelt instead.

This is completely mad. <br><br>2) Agreeing with TheWorst's post #487, last thing I want is a no lynch because that literally gets us nowhere. He is right about the Fire wagon; it's also going nowhere. As far as I'm concerned, some are voting him because they disagree with his style of playing, some.... Well I don't know, it's kind of confusing because it's so messy. All the Fire wagon has brought is a bunch of brawls and people attacking each other and hating on each others play styles and bringing in other games from other subforums or a completely different forum. (Clusterfuck!!!) <br><br>3) Between Fire, Sala, Ciara, and Eventi (as they are the leading wagons), I'm going to <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Eventi</span>. I've gone through ISO's and not ISO's (as in the entire 20 pages of bicker) and I find him most scummy of the 4. I'm not getting a scummy vibe from Fire (maybe his brawling and quarrelling is redirecting it elsewhere and irritating the hell out of me) and Ciara (because V/LA). Sala made me suspicious when he said \"Can people get off the fire wagon please? Get on eventi\" He said somewhere between 20 pages that he isn't a logical player and that is (??????) to me. I feel like I can't trust him because he has no reasoning. <span class=\"noboldsig\">I thought I should vote him because of this but Klingon brought on a good point.</span> He claimed his role with only 2 votes on him.

But why do you think I should be defending myself?). I just stated what I felt. I shouldn't have listened to you, and that is my fault. I didn't blame you for going after Eventi, but I am blaming myself for voting for someone who I didn't think was as scummy as my top scum reads. Also, I should have probably tried to reason with you guys into voting for Klingoncelt or Firebringer instead. Imo, I took too much time rereading and was so confused by the end of day that I decided to get us a lynch rather than thinking if that Lynch is good for us.<br><br>Tbh, I am only mad at you for pressuring me into doing what you felt was the right play for me at that time. Like you literally made me feel that I am not good enough for the game, and I should sub out so that someone else can continue the game. Its a bit humiliating don't you think? I am learning the game, and I don't know everything. Assuming that I know everything, you said that I am not good enough to play the game, I didn't like that at all. I was just under the impression that it is a plurality vote rather than a majority (the newbie game I was in was hammered quickly so I didn't face the near deadline scenario before). And what made me more mad was that Eventi was trying to help me even at that time and I ignored it too. I am kind of still depressed about my play right now, and its not helping that you guys are targeting me for reacting to the flips.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7165063#p7165063\" class=\"postlink\">post 604</a>, Klingoncelt wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7165007#p7165007\" class=\"postlink\">post 600</a>, Salamence20 wrote:</cite>Anyone have any thoughts on Gale's redirection to me as a basis to defend himself?</div></blockquote><br><br>Gale's play today is creeping me out.<br><br>He's gone from total noob mode to posting like an IC in a noob game to deciding he's figured out the Scumteam at the start of Day2. <br><br>I don't like telling noobs to shut up and sit down while the big kids talk, but as long as you're acting so skeevy, Gale, you need to take a back seat and see how it's done.<br><br>If you come up with some actual useful information, then post it.</div></blockquote><br>I don't understand <span class=\"noboldsig\">total noob mode and posting like an IC in a noob game</span>.

I know that mislynch is a probable result on Day 1, but what I am not able to digest is running with Whims and fancies of players, without actually analyzing stuff.<br><br>I am not saying that your gut feeling is always wrong, but after you share your gut feelings and the posts that made you get those feelings, we should analyze those posts and see if most people agree to what you are saying. I can only talk about myself here, and the posts that you felt eventi was scummy (<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7153766#p7153766\" class=\"postlink\">#463</a>) were not ringing any alarm bells in my head. Although, I did find him scummy for <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7135712#p7135712\" class=\"postlink\">#298</a>; but it wasn't as scummy as Klingoncelt's posts.  <br><br>Imo, with the Eventi read. You just took after him for scummy behavior, instead of trying to actually find out if he is scum. I am not sure if that strategy works, but what I have found is people just get defensive and give clumsy reactions like Ciara is giving to Bacde. Instead if we ask Ciara questions about the game, about the flips, her reads, her thoughts about different players then we will get a better picture of whether she is scum or not, don't you think?<br><br>Also, I feel that when we go after people (without solid info), we need to have some sort of rating as to how much scummy we feel that player is. Like if I were to rate Klingoncelt for scumminess then I would rate her as 80:20, and for Firebringer I would rate him as 70:30. Since, it will give us a better picture of how strong our gut feeling is, for that player to be actually scum."}

As much as I want Fire lynched, its not happening at the moment.  He's got too many chums in this game that won't let it happen.  Reminds me of my last game (my only other game on the site so far, a newbie game) that just ended.  I called out the IC for something I felt was scummy on day 1 but couldn't get anyone to join the wagon.  Did the same thing day 2 and no one would join.  Finally in LYLO day 4 they were lynched (were scum) and town won.  I'm only one vote and even though its not happening now, Fire WILL hang and people will facepalm when they see him flip scum and go free for so long.  Maybe when his scum pal is lynched we can associate them.<br><br>Your \"depressed\" post felt forced and that's why I am willing to support a wagon on you.  You seemed overdramatic about the mislynch.  Your follow up in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7165206#p7165206\">612</a> does feel a bit more genuine so now I am not as sure.  If you do indeed feel depressed about the game, take a breather, do something else fun, and don't take things so personally.  I get frustrated with this game (and others - that last game wasn't as bad as this one but I was pulling my hair out) but in the end I play because its fun.  Depression is the opposite of what should be happening.<br><br>About Klingon - I read through your analysis of her before but nothing pinged to me as scummy ATM."}

I didn't blame you for going after Eventi, but I am blaming myself for voting for someone who I didn't think was as scummy as my top scum reads. Also, I should have probably tried to reason with you guys into voting for Klingoncelt or Firebringer instead.

This means that either Eventi dies or we no lynch, which is not good here (No lynching is anti-town here on Mafiascum). Also you didn't listen to me by not rereading during the night. Why not?

I am learning the game, and I don't know everything. Assuming that I know everything, you said that I am not good enough to play the game, I didn't like that at all. I was just under the impression that it is a plurality vote rather than a majority (the newbie game I was in was hammered quickly so I didn't face the near deadline scenario before). And what made me more mad was that Eventi was trying to help me even at that time and I ignored it too. I am kind of still depressed about my play right now, and its not helping that you guys are targeting me for reacting to the flips.<br></div></blockquote><br><br>Well you obviously made some noob mistakes. You decided to reread the entire game with only a day til deadline. Eventi was still scummy. I tried to explain to you that we didn't have the time to run around and do things. We needed a lynch.

And we are stuck in traffic Houston!<br><br>Its actually distracting us from a solid direction, and frustrating me even further. Would someone start making someone talk with some sense around here already? Seriously, till Ciara would be back we could have got someone to talk seriously and made use of our time, but No NO nO No NO. Everyone is happy waiting for Ciara, and for god's sake Bacde stop rotating between Lets lynch Ciara, wait till her V/LA ends, and Lets lynch Ciara.

And I'm more convinced that you're Scum. <br><br>Bacde is scummy, but that doesn't mean he's Scum. Can't make up my mind on Gale.

This seems like Barcode wants Ciara lynched but doesn't want to be on the wagon like he was day 1.  Completely non-commital to the lynch even though he's the one driving it.  Doesn't make sense from a town perspective.<br><br>Raise your hand if you want to follow banana onto a counter wagon on Barcode.

He also ignored anything I said against him, saying he was doing so for \"personal reasons\".<br><br>Fire is now lying about my meta claiming I am too good at blending in as town.  In artificial intelligence, one of the only THREE games we played together, I was correctly called out as scum by a town player who even went as far as to false claim sheriff to try to get me lynched.

That's right, FIRE) and then a jester play the next day ended the game, but I was in no way \"too town\".<br><br>In the second game we played together, I was correctly called out SPECIFICALLY as a COM hunter (and I WAS one) by a player.

Of at least that's your excuse to play horrendously without drawing suspicion somehow isn't it?<br><br>Fire and Bacde are scum together.  Look how they've worked together all game.

Idk, why he self hammered. But for the sake of his final words, and also based on his determined wagon analysis, I would like us to vote for Firebringer or Klingoncelt. <br><br>Surely one of them is definitely scum, if they end up winning this game despite being on all the wagons (<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7155039#p7155039\" class=\"postlink\">eventi</a>, <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7169996#p7169996\" class=\"postlink\">Ciara</a>, <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7190718#p7190718\" class=\"postlink\">Salamence</a>) then its even more humiliating. Also, I am assuming scum blitz means town losing without catching a single scum? And Banana, why do you think we are in LYLO? <br><br>Between eventi, Ciara and Salamence I think we had a diverse set of lynches to confirm that there might not be a four player scum team, or we could have got atleast one scum between them. Although, I am not sure why we can't have a two player scum team.<br><br>But regardless of how big the scum team is, these two were too friendly on day 1. I know that Kling explained that she knows Fire from a different forum, but even then it seems weird to not suspect each other a little on Day 1. Especially, when one of the two was glowing scum for most of day 1.<br><br><div align=\"center\"><hr style=\"height:14px; width:100%\"></div>Now for some responses:<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Banana's accusation of me being scum along with Duppin.</span><br><br>This started with <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7179186#p7179186\" class=\"postlink\">#935</a>. Where I mentioned, \"Duppin is now going for Klingoncelt\" in my post. <br><br>Now Kling read it as though I am saying Duppin is going after her right now, and afaik she joked about me mixing the game thread with the QT thread that the scums get. I still clarified it, because I saw that Kling was seriously responding to Banana. But let me clearly point out why this claim makes little sense. <br><br>1) I assume that the phrase, \"now going for\" means two things in this context. One is the literal meaning that Klingon took from it, and the other is the figurative meaning where it means that Duppin's latest target is/was Klingon.<br><br>2) If you assume the literal meaning of the phrase, just like Klingon did; then it should mean that Duppin had recently posted somewhere (either in the game thread or in the scum thread). I have learned that the scums can only have access to this thread during the night cycle, just as we have access to the game during the day cycle. And Day 3 had started at <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7176026#p7176026\" class=\"postlink\">#811</a>, which was quite a while back. <br><br>Idk what else you guys want me to say about this, it is clear that I was reading his ISO and posted my analysis on why Duppin appears to be scummy based on, off wagon analysis. <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Regarding Mass Claims:</span><br><br>If we are sure that we are in LYLO, then I support the Idea of Mass claim. I will check back later in the day, and I expect you guys to think about who and why we are lynching. <br><br>Tbqh, I am as lost as you guys are, since some of the plays make no sense. The ones I read as scum behave sometimes as town, and the ones I read as town are behaving as scum. Time for another humiliating defeat I suppose."}

Any scum team could claim masons. It is not a good role.</div></blockquote> You hold this stance now, but with experience, you will realize that on mafiascum, masons means masons.<br><br>Outside of players like kuribo, Fate, and DGB (I think they're responsible for the only two mason fakeclaims ever, and both times in a theme game where it backfired stupendously), there's basically never been a mason fakeclaim by scum except in an open setup specifically designed for that. (What's it called, friends and enemies? I'm not well-versed in opens.) Most of the time, when players claim mason, they are taken at face value. Because that's what site meta is. A player doubting masons never enters the minds of a moderator or setup reviewer, because it's something we just never see. And for good reason--if a mason were to be lynched, then their partner gets killed off, making most people not want to lynch masons; if a scum fakeclaiming mason gets lynched, their scumbuddy gets lynched too which in a smaller game especially is VERY bad for them, and too large a risk 95% of the time. (Especially since there's a risk of real masons existing. Like in one of the mason fakeclaim examples above: scum claimed masons, were counterclaimed by the actual masons, actual mason got lynched...and was a venge-mason, killing the fakeclaiming mason.)"}

I do like your playstyle though, I knew why you townread me and it made sense. Don't tunnel too hard though, it ended up costing town a lynch.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">duppin </span>- Was a bit skeptical of you, but you were pretty well-reasoned.

Try to understand what your role is? I dunno. You had moments of brilliance, like the fakeclaim that you probably didn't mean to do, but the self-vote wasn't one of them. Embrace your leadership more!<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Yukari </span>- Your playstyle was pretty good at first, then you seemed to go off course by lynching Ciara. You're a pretty strong townie though, <br>which is why you got killed.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Cthulhu Dreaming</span> - Haha, I wish you stayed in. You were an interesting and mysterious player. Hope you recovered well from your sickness!<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Firebringer</span> - I think it's clear you weren't on your best game. But to be honest, you did get me to suspect Banana, so there's that! Don't get bothered by players like Banana, do your own thing.

It was also pretty clear you were trying to take over the game near the end. Screw you!

First you suspected me, and you proceed to vote third on every town mislynch, only to get mislynched yourself! The Sala wagon ended up being your downfall. Still, you thought outside the box and I commend you for that.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #FF0000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Gale Wing Srock</span></span></span> - Your wall-posting caught me off guard, I didn't suspect you because of that. Your reasoning <br>was pretty otherwise weak though (expected because, well, you're scum), next time I see you, better watch out!  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\"> <br>Also just realized you were defending SamX, don't do that as scum.

I feel partially to blame for it, I allowed it to happen under the pressure of time. Sala was leading the wagon though, so technically it was the right move. Don't be sarcastic all the time though! Your attitude got you lynched.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Ciara24</span> Your inactivity got you lynched, pretty much. I was hoping for more of you, to be honest, but we all have our reasons for inactivity.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Ether, Mastin2</span> - Hope you were entertained!

Any scum team could claim masons. It is not a good role.</div></blockquote> You hold this stance now, but with experience, you will realize that on mafiascum, masons means masons.<br><br>Outside of players like kuribo, Fate, and DGB (I think they're responsible for the only two mason fakeclaims ever, and both times in a theme game where it backfired stupendously), there's basically never been a mason fakeclaim by scum except in an open setup specifically designed for that. (What's it called, friends and enemies? I'm not well-versed in opens.) Most of the time, when players claim mason, they are taken at face value. Because that's what site meta is. A player doubting masons never enters the minds of a moderator or setup reviewer, because it's something we just never see. And for good reason--if a mason were to be lynched, then their partner gets killed off, making most people not want to lynch masons; if a scum fakeclaiming mason gets lynched, their scumbuddy gets lynched too which in a smaller game especially is VERY bad for them, and too large a risk 95% of the time. (Especially since there's a risk of real masons existing. Like in one of the mason fakeclaim examples above: scum claimed masons, were counterclaimed by the actual masons, actual mason got lynched...and was a venge-mason, killing the fakeclaiming mason.)</div></blockquote><br><br>It's worse than that. DGB and I *counterclaimed* masons as scum, and though they were lovers, they were also vengeful. They shot DGB, and I was left to die by lynch the next day <br><br>We did once fake masons with a random player as town, (me + DGB + Fate in the original Serene) but that was less of a strategy and more like LOLSerene. We contemplated the fact that we had done that, considering the three of us were pretty much the people that were known to have fake claimed masons <br><br>I'm fairly certain DGB once got away with it and I know for a fact Fate did, but it takes a certain amount of charisma to pull it off. And even with charisma, it's tough"}
