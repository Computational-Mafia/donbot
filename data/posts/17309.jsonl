I promise to be as just, fair and consistent as humanly possible, but reserve the right to change anything in case i make a mistake.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">1:</div> Unless otherwise <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">specifically</div> specified (that's very specific) by me and only me, you may not discuss the game outside the thread. Doing so will result in a mod kill or replacement of all involved and me being a sad panda. In the same vein you may not quote any private communication from me or other players including PMs and quicktopic. Finally, you may not post the links to the quicktopics.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">2:</div> If you need my attention, either for questions or concerns, PM me or post in <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF8000\">Orange Bold</div></div>, i will be on the lookout for orange, bolded text and will respond to any querys in them as soon as possible.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">3:</div> Modkills will result in the mod-killed player immediately losing the game. I will also then take whatever action is deemed most detrimental (that is, worst) for the faction involved in the modkill, this may include ending the day early (for a town modkill), not ending the day (for a scum modkill) or anything else that seems appropriate at the time.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">4:</div> <div style=\"display: inline; color:#000000 !important; background:#000000 !important; padding:0px 3px;\" title=\"This text is hidden to prevent spoilers; to reveal, highlight it with your cursor.\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#66FF00\">This green is mine, you cannot have it.</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Gameplay</div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">5:</div> Votes msut be in <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">bold</div> and typed as so: <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: PlayerName</div>. I would very much appreciate the use of vote tags by typing [*vote]Name of Person[*/vote] without the asterisks (*'s). While i will accept any bolded vote, i may not notice votes that are not in the vote tags, so save yourself and myself some time and use them tags.\"<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">6:</div> You do not have to unvote (using the unvote tags) before re-voting, but it is preferred as it will make my life easier and making the mod's life easier means a smoother game.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">7:</div> You may vote for No Lynch as he is immune to lynches and thus doing so ends the day without anyone dying from a lynch.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">8:</div> Lynches are reached instantly upon a majority (half + 1) of votes on a single player. If the timeline expires without a lynch being reached, no-one will be lynched and the game will proceed to Night.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">9:</div> If you absolutely must make a bah post, PM me the post before you post it, i will clear it or not. If i do not clear your proposed bah post, you may not make it.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">10:</div> Once a majority is reached the game enters the Twilight phase. You may continue to post during the Twilight phase, which lasts from the moment of majority to when i next check and lock the thread, but no votes made during the Twilight phase will be counted.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">11:</div> Standard MafiaScum rules apply. No secret codes, no invisible text and no editing posts. If you're worried that something you are considering may be in violation of these rules, PM me with a query about your intended action first and i will tell you if it's ok or not.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">12:</div> I will be using <a href=\"https://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Natural_action_resolution\" class=\"postlink\">Natural Action Resolution</a> to determine action results at night.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">13:</div> Any of the roles specifically listed as Normal on <a href=\"https://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Normal_game\" class=\"postlink\">The Wiki</a>.

The time may be extended under certain circumstances, such as a late replacement.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">15:</div> Nights will end when i have recieved all night actions or when 48 hours have elapsed, whichever comes first. Players with night actions who do not wish to use those actions should send a 'no action' PM so as to not delay the night.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">16:</div> Avoid lurking. While it is <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">technically</div> a strategy, it only really ruins the game for everyone else. Any player who does not post at least once every 48 hours will be poked. If i have to poke a player too many times, or the poke is not responded to, the player will be replaced.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">17:</div> If you will be unable to post for an extended period of time (more than 48 hours) due to meatspace concerns, please notify me ahead of time either in PM or in the thread.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Other Things</div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">18:</div> Mafia is an aggressive game, many players use aggression and\\or insults as part of their play strategy. There are, however, limits. If a player is acting inappropriately action will be taken. The line is rather fuzzy and situationally dependant, so if you're worried you might be going to far, you probably are.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">19:</div> First and foremost, mafia is a game. That means the primary goal is to have fun. HOWEVER, players who deliberately and knowingly play against their team's win condition will be frowned upon and probably replaced.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Sample Townie Role PM</div><br>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>You are a <div style=\"display:inline;color:#0040FF\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Townie</div></div>.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">You possess no admirable qualities, just your vote.

How did I try to do that in my post, in your opinion?</div></blockquote><br>\nVoting Scott for \"not saying something over the course of three days\".  There are people that are actively scummy, and yet you try and start a weak lurker hunt.  And, instead of trying to scumhunt, you vote a lurker.  It's really just a cop out.  If you were town, that would have been a prime opportunity to show the people suspicious of you they are wrong with some scumhunting, but you just tried to shift blame onto a lurker.<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Vi wrote:</cite>Would you like to discuss the merits of those votes? I'm sure I'll come out on top.</div></blockquote><br>\nYou copy Quilford's Scott vote.  His Scott vote was bad for the reasons I just mentioned.  Two bad votes don't make a good vote.  And now I'll get in to the timing of your vote.  In the post before you vote Scott, you vote for Quilford because it's a good vote.  Then when Sloth votes Quilford, you immediately unvote and vote for Scott.  I know Quilford's one post in between your posts didn't convince you he wasn't a good vote, because that post did nothing for anybody.  It's like you were afraid that a Quilford lynch would materialize out of this wagon and you wanted to slow it down, because voting Scott for no posting much (even though he's not the biggest lurker) is a horrible reason to stop the pressure on Quilford.<br>\n<br>\nYou vote Hiplop because he wants to make sure he doesn't hammer.  That's not scummy at all.  I get the impression Hiplop is pretty new, and asking like that seems like he's cautious not to do something stupid, not because he's looking to pull a fast one.  Regardless, that's not a reason to vote someone of any experience level over.<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Empking wrote:</cite>Charter: Who is more suspicious: Vi or Looker?</div></blockquote><br>\nRight now I'm leaning Vi because she after he voted Quilford, she's been looking for excuses not to revote him.  Looks like they are buddybuddy to me.  Looker's only post was scummy, but there's no connections like there is with Vi and Quilford.<br>\n<br>\nI keep seeing a lot of noise about Quilford being at L-1, but he's nowhere close.

But you've cracked so hard under virtually no pressure it's extremely unsettling.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\nConsidering that he was at L-1, saying he was under virtually no pressure is false. <br>\nThis is Charter using a strawman argument for why we should lynch Quilford:<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Charter wrote:</cite><br>\nOr would you rather we run up someone to a claim, they throw a fit, and everyone can declare them town, and then repeat it four more times?<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\nI always thought the \"right\" strategy was to run them up to L-2 maybe L-1 to see how they react, and unvote if they did so in a townie manner before forcing a claim.<br>\n<br>\nAs far as Empking goes, he's had some pathetic voting habits so far. He voted Vi because of gut, and later:<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Empking wrote:</cite><br>\nFOS: Scott - This post didn't really say much.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\nAt the time his vote was on Vi because of gut. Soon after, he placed Quilford at L-2, and that vote seems pretty opportunistic to me.<br>\n<br>\nOne thing I have noteworthy is what seems to me to be an obvious connection between Charter and Empking. Sloth started off the game asking some fairly pointless questions, but considering his join date, I don't see them as being a problem, and they were related to things happening in the game, so I don't have a problem with them. In particular, he asked Charter, <br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Sloth wrote:</cite><br>\nCharter, what are your thoughts on RVS wagons?<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\nCharter responded,<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Charter wrote:</cite><br>\nThe bigger, the better.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\nAt the time, Charter had the second vote on Empking, and he voted with<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Charter wrote:</cite><br>\nVote Empking<br>\nWe're going to figure out if you're town on page one.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\nAll of this indicates to me that he wanted a wagon to form on Empking. However, then he unvoted on page 3 in order to pressure Looker. Doing this seems to be contrary to his view of wagon, and also to the goals of his Empking vote. Since it was RVS, none of this would be all that noteworthy, except that the interactions between Charter and Empking have been generally very weak. For example<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Empking wrote:</cite><br>\nCharter: Who is more suspicious: Vi or Looker?<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Charter wrote:</cite><br>\nEmpking, how certain are you Quilford is scum?<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Charter wrote:</cite><br>\nI do want to look over Empking, because his reasons he's been giving recently seem suspect at first glance.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\n<br>\nWhen it comes to Hiplop, we have:<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>hiplop wrote:</cite><br>\nyou didn't say anything in this post, why quote so much if you're not going to say anything useful<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\nhere we have hiplop making a vague attack on my predecessor, but doesn't bother voting him. In his next post he random votes. <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>hiplop wrote:</cite><br>\ni wasn't criticizing, was just wondering why he'd put so much effort into quoting a bunch of posts, but then say nothing. <br>\n<br>\nUnvote<br>\n<br>\nvote:novote<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\nPansy unvoting kitty-cat. <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>hiplop wrote:</cite><br>\nis quilford at l-1? i don't want to hammer but im sort of suspecting him now<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\nSetting up the opportunity to get on the wagon later, while providing an excuse for not doing it now.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>hiplop wrote:</cite><br>\nVOTE: vote quilford<br>\n<br>\nadding pressure<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\nHorrible L-1 vote.<br>\n<br>\nI don't feel as strongly about Vi because these things all happened early, but I'll point them out anyway.<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Vi wrote:</cite><br>\nI definitely think my Neuky vote is best right now. More than anyone else it seems like he's trying to hide.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\nShe'd originally voted Neuky because something seemed off, now she accuses him of trying to hide. Later she explained this as <br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Vi wrote:</cite><br>\n*RV post in the middle of evolving discussion<br>\n*Post clarifying that yes, you were actually trying to say as little as possible<br>\n<br>\nI also saw your name on the active posters list while I was typing 36 and 38, so I knew you were around and not saying anything then too.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\nFirst all attacking someone because you see their name in the active list is terrible, when the person hasn't been lurking. Second of all, the events took place in the middle of RVS, when numerous people were random voting in the middle of evolving discussion. <br>\n<br>\nI also annoys me that Vi called out Sloth for his apparent random vote on Hiplop, but then sheeped Faraday's random vote on Quilford.<br>\n<br>\nScott is a lame nonparticipating lurker who I'd be fine with lynching.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Faraday wrote:</cite><br>\nI'd be surprised if charter was scum.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\nWhy?<br>\n<br>\nAll in all, my strongest scum reads are Charter, Empking and Hiplop, and if either Charter or Empking flipped scum, I'd want to lynch the other.

If you look at the next line in post you quoted from you see that I said,<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Zdenek wrote:</cite><br>\nI have a town read on Faraday (mostly due to the fact that he's declaring so many people to me town, something that I think scum would be hesistant to do), so I am willing to trust his read on Charter.

Same for your Quilford read if faraday still thinks Quilly is scum<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\nFirst of all, the premises of your question are wrong because I don't have a town read on Charter, but I am less inclined to trust Faraday's read of Hiplop, than his read on Charter because part of his rationale for his read on Charter is that he liked Charter's position on the Quilford wagon prior to the claim, which is a fairly concrete reason, whereas his town read on Hiplop is because Hiplop's been careless, and he expects scum to be more careful, which is an argument that I find to be less convincing. Additionally, Charter's recent play gave me a somewhat better feeling about him than I had when I first replaced in. Whereas Hiplop hasn't done anything that makes me feel better about him.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Twistedspoon wrote:</cite><br>\nwhy does empking look more scummy than Hoplip to you?<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\nI've said why I was suspicious of Empking already, and as far a Hiplop goes, part of the reason is exactly the reason that Faraday gave.<br>\n<br>\nI have found all of these questions to be mostly pointless and the foundations of some of them misrepresent the positions I have taken. Their answers should have been completely clear from my posts, and it feels like you've asked them just to try to get me to slip up and say things that could be construed as contradictory.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Darth Yoshi wrote:</cite><br>\n@Zdenek: What about Charter's accusations of me seem reasonable, as there are several, and why?<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\nI think that Charter's suspicion of Juls' first post is reasonable, I agree that you don't really seem to be scum hunting, and I also agree with him about your comment about Neuky's flip. You've partly explained the last one, but looking back, you said, <br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Darth Yoshi wrote:</cite><br>\nNeuky&#8212;partly gut based on how he was explaining earlier actions; am thinking his flip may inform us as to Quil&#8217;s alignment as well.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\nwhich is quite a vague statement, but when you explained it, you clarified it as <br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>DY wrote:</cite><br>\nIf we were to have lynched Quil and he flipped scum, that would have solidified my scumread on Neuky.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\nso it feels like you made too strong an argument at first.<br>\n<br>\nAnyway, at the moment, I'd be happy with a TwistedSpoon lynch, but I see no reason to make today so short, so I won't vote him now.", "time": "Mon May 09, 2011 5:59 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=17309&start=450", "forum": "53", "thread": "17309"}

The mod said that fitz was shot at least once, which leads me to believe that someone else killed fitz as well.  If Neuky was shot because he looked Town, then there's nothing to see - pretty much everyone thought that.  Asking about fitz' reads is probably pointless unless someone cares to step up with incriminating meta about fitz owning them in another game.<br>\n*pap-rat - hiplop thought he was null; everyone else thought he was Town.  pap-rat didn't actively pursue any of his scumreads beyond Empking, so presumably that's not why he was killed.<br>\n<br>\n*Scott B. - Was pretty obviously a shot intended to hit scum.  Nobody really DIDN'T expect Scott B. to be scum though, but Quilford and Zdenek were the only people to say it.  Scott didn't have any suspicions outside Quilford.<br>\n*charter - Was against Sloth and Quilford.  If he was killed for being Town, that implicates Zdenek and DarthYoshi.<br>\n<br>\nYes I know I'm not really implicated by any of this but I don't fall under any of those.<br>\n<br>\nThe Neuky part of this post was typed up when I started pressing DY so etc.<br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\nSo.  My own reads, independent of the above.<br>\n<br>\nI initially thought Faraday was Town, but now I can't make heads or tails of him.  That really makes me uncomfortable, especially with how I'm wondering why HE's still alive right now.  Leading the three-Scummy offense at the beginning of the Day REALLY suggests a setup.  I'm still bothered by his response to the collapsing Quilford wagon as well.<br>\n<br>\nZdenek is one of my picks for a partner to Twistedspoon because of this timeline:<br>\n*469: Teaspoon is scummy for legalistic reasons but I won't vote him<br>\n*508: Teaspoon's response to the fake guilty is null and Scott B. is a bad person for suspecting him AND charter simultaneously<br>\n*529: Vi's reason for caring about the fake guilty is not satisfactory BUT Teaspoon is scum anyway BUT I'm not voting him<br>\n*548: Well okay we can HAMMER now<br>\n<br>\nAll of eight posts to his tally as well.<br>\n<br>\nDarthYoshi reads poorly as well.  The posts D1 are huge but they don't go very far or say anything.  He sheeped right onto the Twistedspoon wagon D2, and went right out the gate D3 calling me a \"policy kill\" while insisting he had no idea why Scott B. was killed when it's pretty obvious.<br>\n<br>\nI think everyone knows my opinion of hiplop.  On one hand I'm inclined to call Town with his response to the Miller claim, but on the other hand he has like three irrational L-1 votes to his name.

THAT looks bad.<br>\n<br>\nOkay...I'll be honest, part of the reason I pressed on Vi as hard as I did out of the gate was simply to see her reaction, because I was WIFOMing myself into thinking she was probscum for being alive so long.  I do have some issues with her #607, which are noted below, but by and large, it is actually a town-looking reaction, IMO.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Vi wrote:</cite> Assuming that Neuky was a shot intended to hit scum - which pap-rat thought was a good idea, I suppose - the only person who expressed suspicion of Neuky was DarthYoshi. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">The mod said that fitz was shot at least once, which leads me to believe that someone else killed fitz as well. </div>If Neuky was shot because he looked Town, then there's nothing to see - pretty much everyone thought that.

On that note, I'll start with Faraday.<br>\n<br>\nFaraday:<br>\n<br>\nHis early play, in retrospect, wasn't particularly townie: he voted for Quilford without providing a reason. He drew attention to Jules without explicitly calling her scum, commenting: <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Faraday wrote:</cite><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Pre-apology: Some of this is out of order because I saw a couple things, noted them and then re-read the first 3 pages in more detail.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\nIs a little weird too.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nHowever, he definitely was scum-hunting. He tried to determine if Hiplop was town or not, by trying to see if Hiplop would sheep his town read of Neuky.<br>\n<br>\nJust because it might be useful, I'm going to keep track of his town reads. He decided that TS, Sloth, Charter and Hiplop were town (or at least townish) fairly early.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Faraday wrote:</cite><br>\nI'd have probably voted quilford for his first 2 posts, they appear like he's trying too hard to settle in the game, this is the same reason I later asked him the 'are you nervous' question, as that's pretty much how it came across to me, that he was uncomfortale and trying to settle in to the game. Vi's right, in that it seems like the response scum would be more likely to make, I'd have thought he'd have well just told me to fuck off, more-so.<br>\n<br>\nI haven't really liked anything he's done since then either tbh, so yeah, wagonwagon on the wall who's the fairest of them all.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nHe finally gave a reason for voting for Quilford, and I don't particularly care for it because he was trying to push a lynch on RVS reasons which is never too good.

It would be addressing a townie to put suspicion on to a scum buddy.<br>\n<br>\nFake investigation test of Hiplop. Unless they are scum together, this essentially clears Hiplop.<br>\n<br>\nThe things that bother me about his play are his push on Quilford without giving his reasons, and the fact that his reads have been fairly fixed since early in the game; the only one that seems to have fluctuated is his read of Hiplop. Also his read of Quilford changed after Quilford's claim. On the other hand,  he is definitely scum hunting, and I agree with his choices of town reads (which makes me feel better about the fact that his reads have remained stable). I don't think that the question to Empking that I just mentioned makes sense coming from scum. I may as well that additionally add that his opinions seem genuine to me, which gives me a gut town read of him.<br>\n<br>\nThe bottom line is that I think he's town. <br>\n<br>\nAnyway, I'll do DY and Vi this weekend.", "time": "Fri May 20, 2011 6:40 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=17309&start=725", "forum": "53", "thread": "17309"}

Odd that he&#8217;d expect others to post meaningful content and then RV. (This is pointed out by Sloth in post 51)<br>\n<br>\n- Vi accuses Sloth of dodging and asks why hiplop over other wagons. (soft defense)<br>\n<br>\n- hiplop&#8217;s post 80 is scummy. doesn&#8217;t address the sheeping accusations and pretends it was his original argument.<br>\n<br>\n- Vi calls Sloth out and says, &#8220;Is there any reason you're still only talking about one person at a time?<br>\nYou're asking a lot of theoretical questions but saying little to nothing about whether people are actually scummy.&#8221; In spite of this, votes a lurker instead.<br>\n<br>\n- hiplop post 108 is massively scummy. Says &#8220;is quilford at l-1? i don't want to hammer but im sort of suspecting him now&#8221;. Doesn&#8217;t say WHY he&#8217;s suspecting him and the &#8220;sort of&#8221; is weak and noncommittal.

Good point against hiplop (which does NOT go away whether he confused the games or not), but combined with Vi's interactions with hiplop all game, this is just distancing.<br>\n<br>\n- vi p 130 :questioning eyebrow:  Setting herself up to potentially join Quil wagon<br>\n<br>\n- TS votes hiplop here. Weird post because he says a lot about a lot of people, but votes hiplop without really saying why. Just asks him to explain his town reads on Faraday and TS. Looks like distancing.<br>\n<br>\n- Neuky post 159 re: hiplop is win. Definitely going to pay attention to how this wagon was derailed because hiplop should&#8217;ve been lynched D1.<br>\n<br>\n- post 175 hiplop super scummy Quil vote. Says it&#8217;s just to add pressure, but seeing as it&#8217;s the other competing wagon it&#8217;s just bad. This may even be L-1 and hiplop&#8217;s only reason is to add pressure?<br>\n<br>\n- DarthYoshi is town. Post 180, &#8220;Faraday&#8212;why is Quil scum? He&#8217;s screaming &#8220;easy lynch&#8221; to me atm.&#8221; and then votes hiplopobvscum. :goodposting:<br>\n<br>\n- Faraday&#8217;s 183 is :notgoodposting: - totally dismisses everything hiplop&#8217;s doing because he&#8217;s new. Maybe he&#8217;s new, but newbtown doesn&#8217;t put someone at L-1 without providing reason and say it&#8217;s to add pressure. Newbscum would certainly do that, though.<br>\n<br>\n- 184 hiplop says he mixed up 2 games. Erm. Doesn&#8217;t unvote in spite of still not providing reasoning for his L-1.<br>\n<br>\n- 231 sloth is town<br>\n<br>\n- 241 Faraday calls out TS<br>\n<br>\n- Whoa 242 pretty much clears Sloth as town. Almost impossible that TS would post this if he and Sloth are scum buddies. Here's the post I'm talking about:<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Twistedspoon wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Faraday wrote:</cite>Twistedspoon very well could be scum here. <br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\nwhat, for giving my opinion that I think Quilford is town?<br>\n<br>\nIt's hardly just me anyways.

The Quil wagon loses steam and is obviously going nowhere and then she white knights Quil and throws suspicion on everyone on the wagon. &#8220;Ignoring Faraday, it's probscum or better all the way down. I don't see myself voting anyone who ISN'T on this list Today.&#8221; This list was Scott Brosius, Faraday, Sloth, charter, Empking, hiplop. I could definitely see ViScum posting this, knowing Quil is town and only one or maybe none of her buddies are on the wagon. Yeah, by the end of 252 I&#8217;m pretty sure Vi and hiplop are scum buddies. She posts a few good points against hiplop but then says hiplop would be a good vote because of lurking (why would you vote for lurking when you have good reason to think they're scum?), and most her real attack is against charter. There was definitely one scum on the Quil wagon. SPOILER: It was hiplop.<br>\n<br>\n-This is hiplop&#8217;s list.

Sometimes you really wish you had day talk, eh Vi? hiplop just <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">wouldn't</div> take the hint on that one.<br>\n<br>\n- Then TS tries to clear hiplop and says, &#8220;Sure, the L-1 reason for Quilford was horrendous by Hiplop, but I know his scum meta and this doesn't seem to follow suit :/&#8221;<br>\n<br>\n- TS points out that Sloth wasn&#8217;t on hiplop&#8217;s list and she then says she gets a bad feeling from him and has a scum/null read on him.

Seriously how was hiplop not lynched D1?<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>post 305 presents: hiplop's faked reads wrote:</cite><br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>hiplop wrote:</cite><div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">In your eyes, hip, what is the reason you're voting Quilford?</div><br>\n<br>\nHes scummy, everything he types seems forced<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">hiplop where'd your neuky town read come from?</div><br>\n<br>\nNeuky has seemed towny the entire time, hes the one im least confident in though, to be honest.</div></blockquote></div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\n- Oh hmm. Faraday clears hiplop as town in 308 for claiming to not have read. Well, Faraday can't always be right. &lt;3<br>\n<br>\n- post 333 newbie game TS evidently tunneled on hiplop who was scum and hiplop&#8217;s play was very similar there. If hiplop were town in this game, TS likely would&#8217;ve gone after him for the same reasons he went after him in the newb game, and he could&#8217;ve been convincing about it. The reason he didn&#8217;t is because in this game they&#8217;re scum buddies.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Sloth wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Hiplop wrote:</cite><br>\nscum<br>\n<br>\nQuilford<br>\nEmpking</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>hiplop wrote:</cite>also can you guys explain the suspicions on Empking?</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nWhy put empking in your scumlist when you don't even know why people suspect him? <br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Hiplop</span></div></blockquote><br>\nRIGHT?!<br>\nSloth = town<br>\nhiplop = scum<br>\n<br>\n- TS post 338 says he&#8217;ll gladly join the hiplop wagon after Sloth&#8217;s &#8220;catch&#8221;. Then he doesn&#8217;t, not until later when Darth calls him out for this. When he does vote he says Sloth&#8217;s catch put &#8220;the final nail in the coffin&#8221; but I don&#8217;t recall him stating other suspicion of hiplop previously, so what are all these other nails? In fact, you may remember that he just tried to clear hiplop as town using meta.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Faraday wrote:</cite>And sure, Neuky. I'd be surprised if hiplop wasn't pulling his scum reads from throwing darts at a dart board to a certain extent, there's a lot of contradictions in his stances, there's some inconsistencies in there, there's basically a lot of stuff that on the surface seems scummy, I think if he WAS scum he'd be more concerned about this, just a little bit. Inconsistency isn't a scumtell anyway, but a new player as scum it'd be something they'd try to avoid if possible. I think he's being relatively careless and sort of just posting on a whim?</div></blockquote><br>\nHe's definitely making stuff up and inventing reasons to have reads. He's concerned about it, alright. He just doesn't realize how contrived his reads sound. <br>\n<br>\n- Vi 384 lots of distancing from hiplop, keeping the option open to bus if needed, but vote remains on empking<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Twistedspoon wrote:</cite>I highly doubt scum will kill hiplop</div></blockquote> obv. since you know he's scum.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Twistedspoon wrote:</cite> I can respect your town read on hiplop, and you can expect my scum read on him, especially after the slip that slothy found </div></blockquote><br>\nScum slips stand out so much more to scum buddies, which is clearly what is happening here.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Twistedspoon wrote:</cite> Scum hiplop played similarly to this in our last game. </div></blockquote><br>\nThis is big here. First TS tries to use meta from that game to clear hiplop as town. (&#8220;Sure, the L-1 reason for Quilford was horrendous by Hiplop, but I know his scum meta and this doesn't seem to follow suit :/&#8221;) NOW he's using meta from that game as a reason to bus. Basically, hiplop and TS are obviously scum together in this game.<br>\n<br>\n- I got scum vibes from Zdenek&#8217;s hop onto the empking wagon in post 415, but then TS&#8217; next post magically made it go away.<br>\n<br>\n- Right after empking is hammered and before flip, TS says &#8220;hmm as inevitable as this lynch may have appeared to be I was still willing to go scotty or hiplop.&#8221; Why would he say this, if not to distance?<br>\n<br>\n- Post 443 - Sloth is town. Faraday votes TS for his twilight posts at the beginning of day 2 but oddly, Sloth does not even though he called him out for them D1. Not sure why.<br>\n<br>\n- After Faraday hints at getting a guilty cop result on hiplop, TS posts these:<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Twistedspoon wrote:</cite>you got a guilty on hiplop did you?<br>\n<br>\nthen I am pleased my suspicions were correct<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: hiplop</span></div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Twistedspoon wrote:</cite>*expects hiplop to claim miller or yelp about a framer*</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nPainfully obvious that TS knows hiplop is scum. Doesn&#8217;t even consider that Faraday might be asking hypothetically or that Faraday might be scum, or that hiplop really could be a miller. Auto assumes hiplop showed up guilty. TS + hiplop = scum. Obv.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>charter wrote:</cite> TS's jumping on Faraday's \"guilty\" on Hiplop gives TS loads of scumpoints.</div></blockquote><br>\nAgreed. It also makes hiplop scum, yo.<br>\n<br>\n- Vi sees TS going down hard and starts defending hiplop. &#8220;hiplop's reaction is decidedly NOT what I would expect from scum in that situation.&#8221; Mmhmmm....<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>hiplop wrote:</cite><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: twisted spoon</span><br>\n<br>\nScummy vote on me, i dont really understand the twilight thing but it seems to be a unanimous thing that he claimed scum<br>\n<br>\nl-1 now</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nobvbus.

Please don&#8217;t tell me this is why hiplop is still alive. Those of you who basically cleared hiplop after his reaction to Faraday's gambit, read this post by TS. Doesn't the fact that TS was supporting that assumption make it lose a little street cred for you? It should.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Vi wrote:</cite> If hiplop claims Miller or yelps about a Framer, then Teaspoon is already in position to disbelieve it. If hiplop doesn't do any of the above, then clearly hiplop is the lynch du jour because lolguilty. No matter how hiplop responded, Teaspoon was going to park a vote on him.</div></blockquote><br>\nThat&#8217;s because TS knew hiplop was scum, clearly. How is Vi not seeing this? Oh wait, right. Scum buddies. Ok, that makes sense.<br>\n<br>\n- 548 + 549 - TS and Zdenek not scum together, which means Zdenek is town. That was easy.<br>\n<br>\n- Agree with Faraday that DY found charter&#8217;s tracker crumb really fast. (DY is scum and lucked out because he didn't send in the kill? With this many town PRs, it's unlikely there's another goon, yes? So DYscum probably would've RB'd or something. More likely, DY is town and didn&#8217;t do anything N1.)<br>\n<br>\n- Vi calling out Faraday for not being NK&#8217;d is ironic, since others feel the same about her. I think Vi didn&#8217;t NK Faraday in order to create this WIFOM. It&#8217;s weird that she&#8217;s even trying to sprinkle suspicion on Faraday since there&#8217;s no way he and TS are scum together when TS was brought down by Faraday&#8217;s fake cop claim gambit. If they were both scum, obviously TS would&#8217;ve known Faraday wasn&#8217;t a cop. Hi.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Vi wrote:</cite> I expected two scum on the Quilford wagon D1 (unless Quilford himself was scum); since Twistedspoon wasn't on the wagon and flipped scum I'm still quite inclined to lynch from there.</div></blockquote><br>\nThis again. With everything Vi could be basing reads on, she comes back to this. Makes me pretty sure there was only one scum on the Quil wagon. *cough* hiplop *cough*<br>\n<br>\n- Ah.
