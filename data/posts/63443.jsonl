Most computer generated pseudo-random numbers rely on very large prime numbers to work, and many aspects of our daily lives would not be possible without prime numbers.<br><br>This vote count is dedicated to one of the coolest things about prime numbers: Ulam Spirals. To get an Ulam spiral, you do what a bored mathematician named Ulam did one day while he was sitting in some boring mathematics lecture at some conference and you write out the numbers on a bit of graph paper in a spiral, starting with 1 and continuing until you get bored of writing out numbers. Then you colour in the prime numbers and you get something that looks a lot like my avatar!<br><br>Instead of random noise, like you would expect if the prime numbers were randomly distributed, you get all these lines and patterns cropping up! I think this means that there is some correlation between the prime numbers and the perfect squares, which are much nicer numbers than the primes if I do say so myself. I will have a lot to say about perfect squares later on.<br><br>Ulam spiral with 40,000 numbers:<br><br><img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/69/Ulam_1.png\" alt=\"Image\"><br><br>Random noise:<br><br><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/Vy0ATJJ.png\" alt=\"Image\"><br><br>The fantastic thing is that you don\u2019t have to start at 1 to get an interesting pattern.

Perfect squares are numbers that if you line up some beans in a square shape you will have that many beans.<br><br>To square a number x you could work out x<sup>2</sup> but that\u2019s not particularly exciting and doesn\u2019t tell you anything you didn\u2019t already know. Is there a better way? YES!<br><br>x<sup>2</sup> = (x+c)(x-c) + c<sup>2</sup>.<br><br>We can see that this is the case if we multiply it through, getting:<br><br>x<sup>2</sup> = x<sup>2</sup> + xc -xc - c<sup>2</sup> + c<sup>2</sup>.<br><br>This is very obviously true for each and every c because +xc -xc = 0 and + c<sup>2</sup> - c<sup>2</sup> = 0 and you can add zero however many times you want to a number if it will make your life easier and you will still have the same number.<br><br>In our case, c is any number that makes the arithmetic easier because we\u2019re doing this in our heads.<br><br>So for example, to take an easy number like 97<sup>2</sup> you could do it the way they taught you in school where you did 7*7 = 49 and 7*90 = 630 and 90*7= 630 again and 90*90 = 8100 and then you could add those up but that\u2019s a lot of numbers to keep track of in your head and you might make a mistake.<br><br>Instead, pick 3 to be our c and we have:<br><br>97<sup>2</sup> = (97+3)(97-3) + 3<sup>2</sup><br><br>97<sup>2</sup> = 100*94 + 3<sup>2</sup><br><br>97<sup>2</sup> = 9400 + 9<br><br>97<sup>2</sup> = 9409<br><br>And this will work for any number that you like. Some are a little harder to do in your head than others but if anyone wants to suggest a number I\u2019ll walk you through it in one of the vote counts.

Factorials are when you take a number, say 5, and multiply it by all the numbers between 1 and it, so 1*2*3*4*5=5!=120. It gets big quickly!<br><br>The first few factorials are: 1, 2, 6, 24, 120, 720, 5040, 40320, 362880, 3628800.<br><br>Combinatorics is the most excitingest bestest part of maths. <br><br>There are 14 of us here including me. What is the chance that any two of us have the same birthday? (ignoring feb 29th and seasonal variation in human mating habits)<br><br>1-365*364*363*362*361*360*359*358*357*356*355*354*353*352/(365<sup>14</sup>) = 22.3%<br><br>Explained: There is a 365/365 chance that I have at least one birthday. There is a 364/365 chance that your birthday is not the same as mine, and a 363/365 chance that a third person\u2019s birthday is different from both of ours. You multiply all the chances together and that\u2019s the chance we have a different birthday. to find the chance at least two of us have the same birthday, you do 1 minus that. 22.3% is higher than most people would expect. It means that about 1 in 4, 1 in 5 minis you\u2019ll have two people with the same birthday playing.<br><br>The break even point is around 23. If you have 23 people, it\u2019s 50% that some two people share a birthday.

In my <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7242564#p7242564\" class=\"postlink\">next post</a>, I mentioned that I was waiting on things and in my <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7242598#p7242598\" class=\"postlink\">post after that</a>, I confirmed that MTD's post was part of that and that I thought he was town. (I don't remember what else I was waiting on <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif\" alt=\":?\" title=\"Confused\"> )  This all happened before you made a big deal over the quote so you really should have noticed it.<br><br>My scum read on Bella came from reading I did after making that post and since I haven't explained that yet:<br>It's based largely on meta.  I've seen her take more initiative early on as town to get her own momentum going on things she cares about, whereas as scum I've seen her do so less.  Her play in this game matches the latter more closely and even without meta, that in and of itself would warrant a slight scum read.  She's V/LA for 3 more days though (sorry about your dog, Bella <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\"> ) so I think that's something that's better left for a bit later.<br><br><br><br>I think Antihero is town but otherwise have no real opinion on what mollie and antihero have said about each other.<br><br>BBT clearly stands better in the BBT vs All Alone battle.

Instead All Alone focused on one of the other quotes from that post and claimed that that one quote didn't provide a clear stance.  While true that that one post alone does not provide a clear stance, pointing that one thing out was blatantly picking and choosing just those pieces of information that supported their side, despite having just quoted something that contradicted their stance.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: All Alone</span>"}

If n is composite then 2<sup>n</sup>-1 is also composite so only prime n need to be checked. <br><br>Here is a list of Mersenne primes:<br><br>2<sup>2</sup> - 1, 2<sup>3</sup> - 1, 2<sup>5</sup> - 1 , 2<sup>7</sup> - 1, 2<sup>13</sup> - 1, 2<sup>17</sup> - 1, 2<sup>19</sup> - 1, 2<sup>31</sup> - 1, 2<sup>61</sup> - 1, 2<sup>89</sup> - 1,  2<sup>107</sup> - 1, 2<sup>127</sup> - 1, 2<sup>521</sup> - 1, 2<sup>607</sup> - 1, 2<sup>1279</sup> - 1, 2<sup>2203</sup> - 1, 2<sup>2281</sup> - 1, 2<sup>3217</sup> - 1, 2<sup>4253</sup> - 1, 2<sup>4423</sup> - 1,  2<sup>9689</sup> - 1, 2<sup>9941</sup> - 1, 2<sup>11213</sup> - 1, 2<sup>19937</sup> - 1, 2<sup>21701</sup> - 1, 2<sup>23209</sup> - 1, 2<sup>44497</sup> - 1, 2<sup>86243</sup> - 1, 2<sup>110503</sup> - 1, 2<sup>132049</sup> - 1, 2<sup>216091</sup> - 1, 2<sup>756839</sup> - 1, 2<sup>859433</sup> - 1, 2<sup>1257787</sup> - 1, 2<sup>1398269</sup> - 1, 2<sup>2976221</sup> - 1, 2<sup>3021377</sup> - 1, 2<sup>6972593</sup> - 1, 2<sup>13466917</sup> - 1, 2<sup>20996011</sup> - 1, 2<sup>24036583</sup> - 1, 2<sup>25964951</sup> - 1, 2<sup>30402457</sup> - 1, 2<sup>32582657</sup> - 1, 2<sup>37156667</sup> - 1, 2<sup>42643801</sup> - 1, 2<sup>43112609</sup> - 1, 2<sup>57885161</sup> - 1.<br><br>Those are all the ones we know about. <br><br>I mostly care about Mersenne because of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mersenne_Twister\" class=\"postlink\">Mersenne Twister</a>, a commonly used pseudorandom number generator. It\u2019s not cryptographically secure because you only need to run it a few times (624 times in the case of MT19937) before you can predict all the future output of the function, but it\u2019s good enough if you\u2019re making a game. The wikipedia article provides sample code in both pseudocode and Python.</span></span></span><br><br><br><img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif\" alt=\":!:\" title=\"Exclamation\"> <span class=\"noboldsig\">pirate mollie</span> (L-3): <span style=\"color: grey\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span style=\"font-style: italic\"><strike>Antihero</strike></span></span></span>, lalaladucks, DeasVail, Fro99er, Wanderer-nl<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">BlueBloodedToffee</span> (L-5):  Espeonage, All Alone<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Espeonage</span> (L-5): MTD, Bellaphant<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">All Alone</span> (L-5): BlueBloodedToffee, DeathRowKitty<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Antihero</span> (L-6): JarJarDrinks<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">JarJarDrinks</span> (L-6): Antihero<br><span style=\"color: grey\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><strike><span style=\"font-style: italic\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">DeathRowKitty</span> (L-6): JarJarDrinks</span></strike></span></span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Not Voting</span> (1): pirate mollie<br><br><span style=\"color: #8040FF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">With 13 alive, it takes 7 to lynch.<br><br>Deadline: 279th (3<sup>2</sup>*31) day of the year or in <span class=\"countdown\"><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">(expired on 2015-10-06 14:00:00)</span></span>.<br><br>Let me know if there are any problems with the VC, or if you have maths related flavour requests.<br><br>Mod notes: Bellaphant is V/LA until the 270th.</span></span></span></fieldset>"}

The method produces Maclaurin series solutions to ODE systems to any order of accuracy desired, and can even be used to solve some systems exactly! The  basic premise is to make what are called polynomial substitiutions to put the system of ODEs in polynomimal form. This allows the numerical algorithm to only need to compute addition, subtraction, and multiplication which is much faster than needing to compute division, powers, or other functional calculations (like sines and cosines). Here is an example of using polynomial substitution to put an ODE in polynomial form:<br><br>Take the differential equation:<br>x'(t) = sin(x(t)) (this equation we will call equation *, also, we will drop the time notation so we have x' = sin(x))<br><br>let:<br>x1 = sin(x)<br>x2 = cos(x)<br><br>then * becomes<br>x' = x1<br>x1' = cos(x)*x' = x2*x1<br>x2' = -sin(x)*x' = -x1*x1<br><br>so our system is<br><br>x' = x1<br>x1' = x1*x2<br>x2' = -x1*x1<br><br>which is a system of ODE all in polynomial form. This can be solved numerically using Picard iteration or exactly by taking X1'/X2' and solving for x1(t) (which can be substituted back into * allowing the reader to integrate that solution to get the final solution for x(t))<br><br>The Parker-Sochacki method can also be used for partial differential equations! Some day, I believe this method can be a part of the proof used to win the Navier-Stokes millenium prize!</div></div></div>"}

class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">One of my favourite fractals is the Sierpi\u0144ski triangle, and if ever I\u2019m in a video game that lets you build things or drop things into piles or whatnot, I will inevitably start arranging objects in this pattern, spending hours building massive 64x64 Sierpi\u0144ski triangles. It\u2019s great fun. <br><br>There are so many different ways to approximate the Sierpi\u0144ski triangle and they all work out the same! You can take a triangle and then mark the midpoints on each side and connect them into a triangle and remove that from the triangle, leaving three triangles stacked together and then remove the middle section of those three triangles and the middle sections of the 9 remaining triangles until you get tired of it.<br><br>You could make 3 long thin blue triangular prisms out of plasticine and 1 long thin white triangular prism and stack them, and then cut the prisms into four pieces and then stack those, and then stretch it out thin and cut into four pieces and stack them. I can\u2019t find that youtube video, though.<br><br>You can also start with 3 points, just the hint of a triangle, label them 1, 2, and 3. Then generate a random number between 1 and 3 and place a dot halfway between your current position (starting at one of the 3 points) and that vertex, then generate another number and repeat until you\u2019ve drawn thousands of dots (this is better done programmatically).<br><br>You can also get a Sierpi\u0144ski triangle with cellular automate by following rule 90.

We started frenching passively and we took off each others clothes enthusiastically. He felt me up before I took of my top. Then I took off my black leather bra and he took off his pants.

Only today Draco and Vampire were depressed so they weren't coming and we wrote songs instead. I knew Draco was probably slitting his wrists (he wouldn't die because he was a vampire too and the only way you can kill a vampire is with a c-r-o-s-s (there's no way I'm writing that) or a steak) and Vampire was probably watching a depressing movie like The Corpse Bride.

For example we could take a point in the complex plane, (1/3 + 1/3 i) for c and then we square it and add c and get 1/3c + 5/9j, and then we square it again and add c get something like 0.14 + 0.7i and this so far is exactly the same as for the Mandelbrot set but this time when we square it we get -0.14 + 0.52j and so we take the absolute value before going on.</span></span></span><br><br><br><img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif\" alt=\":!:\" title=\"Exclamation\"> <span class=\"noboldsig\">Wanderer-nl</span> (L-0): Espeonage, Fro99er, Antihero, JarJarDrinks, lalaladucks, BlueBloodedToffee, All Alone <span style=\"color: #8040FF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">&lt;\u2014LYNCH</span></span></span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">All Alone</span> (L-6): Wanderer-nl<br><span style=\"color: grey\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span style=\"font-style: italic\"><strike><span class=\"noboldsig\">BlueBloodedToffee</span> (L-6) All Alone</strike></span></span></span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Not Voting</span> (4): Bellaphant, DeasVail, DeathRowKitty, MTD<br><br><span style=\"color: #8040FF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">With 12 alive, it took 7 to lynch.<br><br>Deadline: 284th (2<sup>2</sup>*71) day of the year or in <span class=\"countdown\"><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">(expired on 2015-10-13 14:00:00)</span></span>.<br><br>Let me know if there are any problems with the VC, or if you have maths related flavour requests.<br><br>Flavour Queue Written: empty <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif\" alt=\":neutral:\" title=\"Neutral\"><br><div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: Things I haven\u2019t rambled about yet but i\u2019m gonna</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display: none;\">more about the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture, P vs NP, more figurate numbers, Hodge conjecture, Yang-Mills existence and mass gap, Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem, Hilbert Space Filling Curve, Mandelbrot Set, Complex Analysis, Lattice Multiplication, miscellaneous numberphile and vihart videos, practical numbers, abundant numbers, pronic numbers, lucky numbers, proth numbers, thabit numbers, hilbert numbers, leyland numbers, fibonacci numbers, jacobsthal numbers, pell numbers, pell-lucas numbers, leonardo numbers, perrin numbers, polite numbers, motzkin numbers, Erd\u0151s\u2013Woods numbers, vampire numbers, Recursion and Mafia, maths jokes that I wrote myself and why they are funny, Abelian groups and semigroups, noncommutative operations, the 68-95-99.7 rule, fro99er\u2019s first theorem</div></div></div><br><br>Mod notes: Today is the 274rd day of the year. 2*137.

If they are a town roleblocker and roleblocked BBT I've already stated that I know of at least one other way the kill could have been stopped. So it doesn't make All Alone scum at all.

All I can say is what I have already said. I know of a possible explanation for the lack of kill, different from All Alone's roleblock. It's hard for me to say how likely that is. I consider it possible but by no means definite. I'm not willing to elaborate at this point.

Now even if I don't really think that roleblockers block scum kills, surely if I was the one that made the kill attempt, it didn't go through, AND someone claimed to have roleblocked me, surely I would put two and two together and realise... Damn! Roleblockers must block scum kills as well.<br><br>Ok, I don't want to be hypothetical scum BBT anymore. That was kind of weird. BUT, does BBT make that sort of post in response to the roleblocker claim as scum? When I made my last post my thought was no, but now I've realised that even assuming that BBT didn't know that roleblockers blocked scum kills (and thought this was some weird variant or whatever), he could still make that post as scum in an attempt to convince everyone that this rb is what he thought was a normal roleblocker. However, one thing I do need to say is that regardless of his alignment, I don't think BBT was making up his lack of roleblocker knowledge. If he actually knew what a roleblocker was then he'd know how inconclusive All Alone's claim was and not risk getting caught out in a lie ----&gt; autolynched. I've seen town forget their role before and be caught out in a lie during massclaim. Stranger things have happened.<br><br>So summary is that I no longer think his thing about not knowing roleblockers is particularly alignment-relevant. The increased likelihood of being scum due to the roleblock still stands, but this is not a certain thing and I'm not going to lynch him for this reason.<br><br>But what do I actually think of BBT?<br><br>The things that most strike me upon re-ISOing him are:<br>-<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7246111#p7246111\">338</a>, which I still don't like. The explanation he provided in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7250870#p7250870\">582</a> also does not satisfy me entirely. It seems more of an attempt to get people to not suspect him rather than having any real town benefit.<br>-If BBT is scum I don't think he made the shot.<br>Reason: I've already decided that I don't think BBT was lying about the roleblock thing. And now I've realised that upon being blocked he probably would have been reminded of the fact or looked into whether roleblockers actually commonly blocked scum kills, which I think would have discouraged BBT-scum from reacting in such a way to the claim.<br>Sorry for my mess of thoughts regarding that, but I believe if BBT was scum that made the kill he would have taken a different, less risky approach. I'm worried I'm totally wrong but it's what I think atm.<br>I also think that if he had, Wanderer wouldn't have made <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7260975#p7260975\">704</a> after everyone else seemed to be assuming BBT was scum.<br><br>My current read on BBT is town, mostly due to the above, plus Wanderer going for All Alone (which I do suspect she would have avoided if BBT was her partner). However, I'm not confident in this read.<br><br><span style=\"color: #8040FF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Fixed tag fail. --P</span></span></span>"}

If you say who you blocked I can use that information to help me read u better.<br><br>- But even if you are town there can definitely be a town gain from telling us who you blocked:  Lets say we eventually lynch BBT and he flips red.. well odds are scum didnt use him as an attacker on night 2 cause there was probably too great of a chance of u blocking him again.

I'm pretty sure you're town and I like your read on BBT, though my tendency in this sort of situation would be to lynch/vig Bella who I'd feel more comfortable with dead (&lt;3 you Bella). If you tell me to vote BBT, I will though. (And this isn't an attempt to put the blame on you if he does flip town.

Scum don't claim like that because once I'm lynched, suspicion falls heavily onto All Alone and he has a very difficult time surviving the next day.<br><br>2) Anti was very much against the whole idea of 'BBT was roleblocked and is conf scum' which is the ONLY reason people are using for lynching me. My wagon is so, so easy for scum to jump on because of the basis of it. Anti wouldn't have let this wagon go through and he was one of the louder voices in the town - that's why he is dead. Look at the game from a scum!BBT perspective - at end of D2 all of you, All Alone, Lala and Fro99er thought I was scum - why the fuck would I leave you all alive and KILL the person who would have defended me? Killing Anti is a fucking awful move if I'm scum and I would like to think I'm better than that.<br><br>3) No. Killing All Alone takes one vote away from my wagon - why would scum want that? They know All Alone is coming into the day and voting me - no matter what. He has barely even interacted with anyone else, he is no danger to scum.

You were in no danger of being lynched before the wanderer vote took off?  But scum was totally killing anti and leaving all alone alive because they knew that the town would mislynch you?

It was tremendous fun watching you guys play and it helped give me enthusiasm back for my own game at a time when I was feeling a bit burnt out on playing mafia myself. Aside from the 1, essentially pre-game replacement of SithLord who confirmed but never picked up the day 1 start PM, you guys all stayed with me from the beginning and I appreciate that a lot!<br><br>Thank you to <span style=\"color: #008080\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Panther</span></span>, <span style=\"color: #8000FF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">pistachi0n</span></span>, <span style=\"color: #4000FF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">goodmorning</span></span>, <span style=\"color: #00BF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">herrcombs</span></span>, and <span style=\"color: #400040\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">mala</span></span> for joining in my replacement queue and I'm sorry you guys didn't get to play!<br><br><span style=\"color: #00BF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Froggyfrog</span></span>, thanks for replacing in! You played really well and I loved your silliness. I liked the way you responded to DV after you'd been so excited about your plan and found a way to work together with the town and explain your ideas to other people in the end.<br><br><span style=\"color: #FF80FF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Bella</span></span>, you're great and I'm really glad you neighbourised frogger. I'm sorry I couldn't have made you scum but maybe next time! I was also impressed that you held back your vig shot, which I felt was the protown thing to do, to wait until later when you were sure and had stronger reads, because when balancing it I was pretty sure the vig would just shoot town night 1. You didn't; you used your head.<br><br><span style=\"color: #0000BF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Espy</span></span>, you're so awesome and I'm glad you joined this. I like your playstyle.<br><br><span style=\"color: #FF4000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Anti</span></span>, you're awesome and thank you for posting twilight/harry potter fanfic to help me get to page tops and for playing in my game even though you had to solo. Your reads were really good and it was really fun having you.<br><br><span style=\"color: #0040FF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Bubbletea</span></span>, it was really impressive watching you play and keep trying even as one thing went wrong after another. I would have probably given up long before you did, but you were a really good sport about it. You guys got really unlucky night1 with the combination of hitting DV's bulletproof and all alone roleblocking scum who didn't do the kill, but even after that there were moments where I thought you might pull it off anyway. You played really well.<br><br><span style=\"color: #80BFFF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Wanderer-nl</span></span>, same goes to you. It was great having you and I loved watching you play.<br><br><span style=\"color: #BF0080\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">pirate mollie</span></span>, I'm really sorry you didn't have fun in this game and I wish it could have been fun for you.<br><br><span style=\"color: #00FFFF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">All Alone</span></span>, I am seriously impressed with you. You have really good scumdar and good reads and you're one of the best people who could have got the role of roleblocker. I think people underestimate you because of your low postcount playstyle and recent join date, use that to your advantage <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smiling.png\" alt=\":]\" title=\"Cheerful Smile\"><br><br><span style=\"color: #80BF40\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">DeasVail</span></span>, it was great getting to know you and watching you play. You're really good at looking town and it was really clever how you played bulletproof on day 1. The scumteam thought you were crumbing doc with your comments to mollie so I was surprised when you said masons with JarJar but I could see that too when I went back and looked. Either way it was really great! I loved your sense of humour also. You're great! <br><br><span style=\"color: #800040\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">MTD</span></span>, I really appreciate how you stuck it through to the end because I would have 100% started twilight trolling before I even got to L-1. You were in an unwinnable position but you kept trying anyway and that's impressive. <br><br><span style=\"color: #008040\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">DRK</span></span>, you are so great and I wanted to edit &lt;3 into all of your maths posts and wanted to ramble at you about mathematics everytime you posted but I couldn't because I was the mod but you were great and I love the way you write and think.<br><br><span style=\"color: #80FF40\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">ducky</span></span>, you were probably the best person who could have been innocent child. I loved your silliness this game and giving everyone fun names and you managed to look pushable throughout the whole game and keep the scumteam thinking they could push your lynch without looking so scummy that they'd push you day1/2 and force you to reveal sooner than neccessary. You did great!<br><br><span style=\"color: #404080\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">JarJar</span></span>, this was your first game out of Rome and I feel like it may have been a difficult one since almost everybody else already knew everybody else and you were kinda by yourself which is a hard situation to be in, but in spite of that you managed to be really active and shared your ideas with people and I think you did really well. Thanks for sticking with it and I feel like your play improved a lot over the course of the game. It was a pleasure watching you play and I wish you luck in your future games!<br><br><span style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;\"><span style=\"color: #8040FF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Coming up next:</span></span></span></span><br>Probably my <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7280442#p7280442\" class=\"postlink\">everybody's a bodyguard</a> setup in the micro queue with \"Slavic songs i like\" for flavour and my \"Get a Room\" mechanic tacked onto it (basically if 2 people are having or need to have a discussion that nobody else cares about they can be told to get a room and are given a neighbourhood to work out their differences in + 48 hour post restriction that they can't talk to or about each other in the thread.)<br><br><br><span style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;\"><span style=\"color: #8040FF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Thanks for playing everyone &lt;3</span></span></span></span>"}
