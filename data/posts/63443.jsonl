Most computer generated pseudo-random numbers rely on very large prime numbers to work, and many aspects of our daily lives would not be possible without prime numbers.<br>\n<br>\nThis vote count is dedicated to one of the coolest things about prime numbers: Ulam Spirals. To get an Ulam spiral, you do what a bored mathematician named Ulam did one day while he was sitting in some boring mathematics lecture at some conference and you write out the numbers on a bit of graph paper in a spiral, starting with 1 and continuing until you get bored of writing out numbers. Then you colour in the prime numbers and you get something that looks a lot like my avatar!<br>\n<br>\nInstead of random noise, like you would expect if the prime numbers were randomly distributed, you get all these lines and patterns cropping up! I think this means that there is some correlation between the prime numbers and the perfect squares, which are much nicer numbers than the primes if I do say so myself. I will have a lot to say about perfect squares later on.<br>\n<br>\nUlam spiral with 40,000 numbers:<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/69/Ulam_1.png\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"><br>\n<br>\nRandom noise:<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/Vy0ATJJ.png\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"><br>\n<br>\nThe fantastic thing is that you don&#8217;t have to start at 1 to get an interesting pattern.

Perfect squares are numbers that if you line up some beans in a square shape you will have that many beans.<br>\n<br>\nTo square a number x you could work out x<sup>2</sup> but that&#8217;s not particularly exciting and doesn&#8217;t tell you anything you didn&#8217;t already know. Is there a better way? YES!<br>\n<br>\nx<sup>2</sup> = (x+c)(x-c) + c<sup>2</sup>.<br>\n<br>\nWe can see that this is the case if we multiply it through, getting:<br>\n<br>\nx<sup>2</sup> = x<sup>2</sup> + xc -xc - c<sup>2</sup> + c<sup>2</sup>.<br>\n<br>\nThis is very obviously true for each and every c because +xc -xc = 0 and + c<sup>2</sup> - c<sup>2</sup> = 0 and you can add zero however many times you want to a number if it will make your life easier and you will still have the same number.<br>\n<br>\nIn our case, c is any number that makes the arithmetic easier because we&#8217;re doing this in our heads.<br>\n<br>\nSo for example, to take an easy number like 97<sup>2</sup> you could do it the way they taught you in school where you did 7*7 = 49 and 7*90 = 630 and 90*7= 630 again and 90*90 = 8100 and then you could add those up but that&#8217;s a lot of numbers to keep track of in your head and you might make a mistake.<br>\n<br>\nInstead, pick 3 to be our c and we have:<br>\n<br>\n97<sup>2</sup> = (97+3)(97-3) + 3<sup>2</sup><br>\n<br>\n97<sup>2</sup> = 100*94 + 3<sup>2</sup><br>\n<br>\n97<sup>2</sup> = 9400 + 9<br>\n<br>\n97<sup>2</sup> = 9409<br>\n<br>\nAnd this will work for any number that you like.

Factorials are when you take a number, say 5, and multiply it by all the numbers between 1 and it, so 1*2*3*4*5=5!=120. It gets big quickly!<br>\n<br>\nThe first few factorials are: 1, 2, 6, 24, 120, 720, 5040, 40320, 362880, 3628800.<br>\n<br>\nCombinatorics is the most excitingest bestest part of maths. <br>\n<br>\nThere are 14 of us here including me. What is the chance that any two of us have the same birthday? (ignoring feb 29th and seasonal variation in human mating habits)<br>\n<br>\n1-365*364*363*362*361*360*359*358*357*356*355*354*353*352/(365<sup>14</sup>) = 22.3%<br>\n<br>\nExplained: There is a 365/365 chance that I have at least one birthday. There is a 364/365 chance that your birthday is not the same as mine, and a 363/365 chance that a third person&#8217;s birthday is different from both of ours. You multiply all the chances together and that&#8217;s the chance we have a different birthday. to find the chance at least two of us have the same birthday, you do 1 minus that. 22.3% is higher than most people would expect. It means that about 1 in 4, 1 in 5 minis you&#8217;ll have two people with the same birthday playing.<br>\n<br>\nThe break even point is around 23. If you have 23 people, it&#8217;s 50% that some two people share a birthday. So if you play in a couple larges, sooner or later you&#8217;ll find your twin!</div></div><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":!:\" title=\"Exclamation\"> <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">BlueBloodedToffee</div> (L-4):  Espeonage, lalaladucks, All Alone<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Espeonage</div> (L-5): <div style=\"display:inline;color:grey\"><div style=\"display:inline-flex;text-decoration:line-through\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">BlueBloodedToffee</div></div></div>, MTD, Bellaphant<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">lalaladucks</div> (L-6): <div style=\"display:inline;color:grey\"><div style=\"display:inline-flex;text-decoration:line-through\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">JarJarDrinks</div></div></div>, DeasVail<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">pirate mollie</div> (L-6): Antihero<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">All Alone</div> (L-6): BlueBloodedToffee<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">DeathRowKitty</div> (L-6): JarJarDrinks<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Not Voting</div> (4): SithLord84, Wanderer-nl, DeathRowKitty, pirate mollie<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#8040FF\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">With 13 alive, it takes 7 to lynch.<br>\n<br>\nDeadline: 279th (3<sup>2</sup>*31) day of the year or in <span class=\"countdown\">(expired on 2015-10-06 14:00:00)</span>.<br>\n<br>\nLet me know if there are any problems with the VC, or if you have maths related flavour requests.<br>\n<br>\nMod notes: I have a more readable mod colour now.</div></div></fieldset>", "time": "Wed Sep 23, 2015 5:24 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=63443&start=225", "forum": "53", "thread": "63443"}

This number just happens to have exactly the right number of digits to use a neat trick.

For example you could remember the first 16 digits of pi with &#8220;my turtle banjo lime love book palm&#8221; 3.141692653589793.<br>\n<br>\nYou can make up words on the fly with this system and that&#8217;s good practice, but ultimately what you want to do is decide on a set of words that will always mean certain numbers, for example 1 is always tea and never anything else and so if you want to remember the first thing on your list you ask yourself if you have any funny stories about tea. If 1 is sometimes tea and sometimes tie then you might make a funny story about tea and but then you go looking for a story about a tie and you don&#8217;t find anything.<br>\n<br>\nIt can be fun to try to count this way, trying to use the same words each time: <br>\nsea, tea, Noah, ma, ray, law, jaw, key, foe, paw, <br>\ndaze, dad, den, dam, dare, dale, dash, deck, dive, dab, <br>\nNASA, net, nun, name, near, nail, nudge, neck, navy, nab,<br>\nmouse, mat, man, mama, mare, mail, mash, mac, mafia, map,<br>\nrace, rat, ran, ram, rare, rail, rash, reck, reef, rap,<br>\nlace, lad, lane, lamb, lair, lily, lash, lake, love, lab,<br>\nchase, chat, chain, chime, chair, chill, cha-cha, check, chav, chap,<br>\ncase, cat, can, cam, car, call, cash, cake, calf, cap<br>\nface, fat, fan, femme, fear, fail, fish, fake, fife, fab<br>\nbase, bat, ban, bomb, boar, ball, bash, back, buff, baby<br>\ndaisies&#8230;<br>\n<br>\nThen if you have to remember a shopping list to buy potatoes, onions, mustard, marjoram, garlic, paprika, chill powder, salt, oil, you could tell yourself a story &#8220;The <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">potatoes</div> came alive and were swimming in <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">sea</div> and I steeped some <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">onion</div> peels in hot water to make a <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">tea</div> and <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Noah</div> fed the animal some sweet Bavarian <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">mustard</div> and <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">ma</div> is growing <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">marjoram</div> in her garden, a <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">ray</div> of light shining on a single clove of <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">garlic</div> revealing the garlic to be the One True Seasoning that must be put into all the dishes and so the redheaded child smeared some <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">paprika</div> on his <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">jaw</div> to make it look like he was old enough to grow a beard and put <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">chili powder</div> on the <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">key</div> so that it would burn the fingers of whoever touched it and throwing <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">salt</div> in the eyes of your <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">foe</div>s to get them to leave you alone and putting fish <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">oil</div> on the constipated cat&#8217;s <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">paw</div> so it will lick it up.&#8221; <br>\n<br>\nIf you visualise it to yourself and try to make it as funny as possible you&#8217;ll be able to remember most of it, and then when you're at the shops you just run through the list like sea tea noah ma ray law jaw key foe paw and you&#8217;ll have it.

Notice that despite unvoting in that post, I didn't put a vote down.  In my <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7242564#p7242564\" class=\"postlink\">next post</a>, I mentioned that I was waiting on things and in my <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7242598#p7242598\" class=\"postlink\">post after that</a>, I confirmed that MTD's post was part of that and that I thought he was town. (I don't remember what else I was waiting on <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":?\" title=\"Confused\"> )  This all happened before you made a big deal over the quote so you really should have noticed it.<br>\n<br>\nMy scum read on Bella came from reading I did after making that post and since I haven't explained that yet:<br>\nIt's based largely on meta.  I've seen her take more initiative early on as town to get her own momentum going on things she cares about, whereas as scum I've seen her do so less.  Her play in this game matches the latter more closely and even without meta, that in and of itself would warrant a slight scum read.  She's V/LA for 3 more days though (sorry about your dog, Bella <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\"> ) so I think that's something that's better left for a bit later.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nI think Antihero is town but otherwise have no real opinion on what mollie and antihero have said about each other.<br>\n<br>\nBBT clearly stands better in the BBT vs All Alone battle.

Instead All Alone focused on one of the other quotes from that post and claimed that that one quote didn't provide a clear stance.  While true that that one post alone does not provide a clear stance, pointing that one thing out was blatantly picking and choosing just those pieces of information that supported their side, despite having just quoted something that contradicted their stance.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: All Alone</div>", "time": "Thu Sep 24, 2015 11:48 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=63443&start=350", "forum": "53", "thread": "63443"}

The method produces Maclaurin series solutions to ODE systems to any order of accuracy desired, and can even be used to solve some systems exactly! The  basic premise is to make what are called polynomial substitiutions to put the system of ODEs in polynomimal form. This allows the numerical algorithm to only need to compute addition, subtraction, and multiplication which is much faster than needing to compute division, powers, or other functional calculations (like sines and cosines). Here is an example of using polynomial substitution to put an ODE in polynomial form:<br>\n<br>\nTake the differential equation:<br>\nx'(t) = sin(x(t)) (this equation we will call equation *, also, we will drop the time notation so we have x' = sin(x))<br>\n<br>\nlet:<br>\nx1 = sin(x)<br>\nx2 = cos(x)<br>\n<br>\nthen * becomes<br>\nx' = x1<br>\nx1' = cos(x)*x' = x2*x1<br>\nx2' = -sin(x)*x' = -x1*x1<br>\n<br>\nso our system is<br>\n<br>\nx' = x1<br>\nx1' = x1*x2<br>\nx2' = -x1*x1<br>\n<br>\nwhich is a system of ODE all in polynomial form. This can be solved numerically using Picard iteration or exactly by taking X1'/X2' and solving for x1(t) (which can be substituted back into * allowing the reader to integrate that solution to get the final solution for x(t))<br>\n<br>\nThe Parker-Sochacki method can also be used for partial differential equations! Some day, I believe this method can be a part of the proof used to win the Navier-Stokes millenium prize!</div></div></div>", "time": "Wed Sep 30, 2015 2:00 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=63443&start=750", "forum": "53", "thread": "63443"}

So 196 isn&#8217;t an Achilles number because it&#8217;s 14<sup>2</sup> but 392 is because it&#8217;s not a perfect square and it&#8217;s not a perfect cube etc. <br>\n<br>\nIf you do the prime factorisation and all the prime factors are raised to the same power, then it&#8217;s not an Achilles number. <br>\n<br>\nThe first few Achilles number are: 72, 108, 200, 288, 392, 432, 500, 648, 675, 800, 864, 968, 972, 1125, 1152, 1323, 1352, 1372, 1568, 1800, 1944, 2000, 2312, 2592, 2700, 2888, 3087, 3200, 3267, 3456, 3528, 3872, 3888, 4000, 4232, 4500, 4563, 4608, 5000.<br>\n<br>\n5425069447 and 5425069448 are consecutive Achilles numbers!

Sierpi&#324;ski triangle, and if ever I&#8217;m in a video game that lets you build things or drop things into piles or whatnot, I will inevitably start arranging objects in this pattern, spending hours building massive 64x64 Sierpi&#324;ski triangles. It&#8217;s great fun. <br>\n<br>\nThere are so many different ways to approximate the Sierpi&#324;ski triangle and they all work out the same! You can take a triangle and then mark the midpoints on each side and connect them into a triangle and remove that from the triangle, leaving three triangles stacked together and then remove the middle section of those three triangles and the middle sections of the 9 remaining triangles until you get tired of it.<br>\n<br>\nYou could make 3 long thin blue triangular prisms out of plasticine and 1 long thin white triangular prism and stack them, and then cut the prisms into four pieces and then stack those, and then stretch it out thin and cut into four pieces and stack them. I can&#8217;t find that youtube video, though.<br>\n<br>\nYou can also start with 3 points, just the hint of a triangle, label them 1, 2, and 3. Then generate a random number between 1 and 3 and place a dot halfway between your current position (starting at one of the 3 points) and that vertex, then generate another number and repeat until you&#8217;ve drawn thousands of dots (this is better done programmatically).<br>\n<br>\nYou can also get a Sierpi&#324;ski triangle with cellular automate by following rule 90. Start with a single point. In a square grid, each new cell is the xor of its neighbours. <br>\n<br>\nOf course, triangular grids are more exciting for drawing a Sierpi&#324;ski triangle with cellular automata rules. Crochet is done on a triangular grid and my wallet which I made myself has a Sierpi&#324;ski triangle on one side and a Hilbert space filling curve on the other.</div></div><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":!:\" title=\"Exclamation\"> <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Wanderer-nl</div> (L-1): Espeonage, Fro99er, Antihero, JarJarDrinks, lalaladucks, BlueBloodedToffee<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">BlueBloodedToffee</div> (L-6) All Alone<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">All Alone</div> (L-6): Wanderer-nl<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:grey\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\"><div style=\"display:inline-flex;text-decoration:line-through\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">lalaladucks</div> (L-7): BlueBloodedToffee</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Not Voting</div> (4): Bellaphant, DeasVail, DeathRowKitty, MTD<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#8040FF\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">With 12 alive, it takes 7 to lynch.<br>\n<br>\nDeadline: 284th (2<sup>2</sup>*71) day of the year or in <span class=\"countdown\">(expired on 2015-10-13 14:00:00)</span>.<br>\n<br>\nLet me know if there are any problems with the VC, or if you have maths related flavour requests.<br>\n<br>\nFlavour Queue Written: empty <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":neutral:\" title=\"Neutral\"><br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: Things I haven&#8217;t rambled about yet but i&#8217;m gonna</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\">more about the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture, P vs NP, more figurate numbers, Hodge conjecture, Yang-Mills existence and mass gap, Fermat&#8217;s Last Theorem, Hilbert Space Filling Curve, Mandelbrot Set, Burning Ship Fractal, Complex Analysis, Lattice Multiplication, miscellaneous numberphile and vihart videos, practical numbers, abundant numbers, ulam sequence, pronic numbers, lucky numbers, proth numbers, thabit numbers, hilbert numbers, leyland numbers, fibonacci numbers, jacobsthal numbers, pell numbers, pell-lucas numbers, leonardo numbers, perrin numbers, polite numbers, motzkin numbers, Erd&#337;s&#8211;Woods numbers, vampire numbers, Recursion and Mafia, maths jokes that I wrote myself and why they are funny, Abelian groups and semigroups, noncommutative operations, the 68-95-99.7 rule, fro99er&#8217;s first theorem</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\nMod notes: Today is the 274rd day of the year. 2*137.

Only today Draco and Vampire were depressed so they weren't coming and we wrote songs instead. I knew Draco was probably slitting his wrists (he wouldn't die because he was a vampire too and the only way you can kill a vampire is with a c-r-o-s-s (there's no way I'm writing that) or a steak) and Vampire was probably watching a depressing movie like The Corpse Bride.

For example we could take a point in the complex plane, (1/3 + 1/3 i) for c and then we square it and add c and get 1/3c + 5/9j, and then we square it again and add c get something like 0.14 + 0.7i and this so far is exactly the same as for the Mandelbrot set but this time when we square it we get -0.14 + 0.52j and so we take the absolute value before going on.</div></div><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":!:\" title=\"Exclamation\"> <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Wanderer-nl</div> (L-0): Espeonage, Fro99er, Antihero, JarJarDrinks, lalaladucks, BlueBloodedToffee, All Alone <div style=\"display:inline;color:#8040FF\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">&lt;&#8212;LYNCH</div></div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">All Alone</div> (L-6): Wanderer-nl<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:grey\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\"><div style=\"display:inline-flex;text-decoration:line-through\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">BlueBloodedToffee</div> (L-6) All Alone</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Not Voting</div> (4): Bellaphant, DeasVail, DeathRowKitty, MTD<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#8040FF\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">With 12 alive, it took 7 to lynch.<br>\n<br>\nDeadline: 284th (2<sup>2</sup>*71) day of the year or in <span class=\"countdown\">(expired on 2015-10-13 14:00:00)</span>.<br>\n<br>\nLet me know if there are any problems with the VC, or if you have maths related flavour requests.<br>\n<br>\nFlavour Queue Written: empty <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":neutral:\" title=\"Neutral\"><br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: Things I haven&#8217;t rambled about yet but i&#8217;m gonna</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\">more about the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture, P vs NP, more figurate numbers, Hodge conjecture, Yang-Mills existence and mass gap, Fermat&#8217;s Last Theorem, Hilbert Space Filling Curve, Mandelbrot Set, Complex Analysis, Lattice Multiplication, miscellaneous numberphile and vihart videos, practical numbers, abundant numbers, pronic numbers, lucky numbers, proth numbers, thabit numbers, hilbert numbers, leyland numbers, fibonacci numbers, jacobsthal numbers, pell numbers, pell-lucas numbers, leonardo numbers, perrin numbers, polite numbers, motzkin numbers, Erd&#337;s&#8211;Woods numbers, vampire numbers, Recursion and Mafia, maths jokes that I wrote myself and why they are funny, Abelian groups and semigroups, noncommutative operations, the 68-95-99.7 rule, fro99er&#8217;s first theorem</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\nMod notes: Today is the 274rd day of the year. 2*137.

If they are a town roleblocker and roleblocked BBT I've already stated that I know of at least one other way the kill could have been stopped. So it doesn't make All Alone scum at all. You're turning the BBT/All Alone thing into a pseudo-1v1 and I haven't made up my mind on BBT yet but if he's town then it's pretty ehhhhh. That was my thought process at the time anyway, but I think you're town now that I'm reading through so NEVER MIND.<br>\n<br>\nRegarding Wanderer's 'slip', it's possible, though at the time I thought it would be a reasonable expectation for town to just assume that I have an action. So I wasn't going to take it as a particularly scummy thing.

All I can say is what I have already said. I know of a possible explanation for the lack of kill, different from All Alone's roleblock. It's hard for me to say how likely that is. I consider it possible but by no means definite. I'm not willing to elaborate at this point. If you want to suspect me then go ahead but I think it'd be a waste of effort regardless of your alignment.

Now even if I don't really think that roleblockers block scum kills, surely if I was the one that made the kill attempt, it didn't go through, AND someone claimed to have roleblocked me, surely I would put two and two together and realise... Damn! Roleblockers must block scum kills as well.<br>\n<br>\nOk, I don't want to be hypothetical scum BBT anymore. That was kind of weird. BUT, does BBT make that sort of post in response to the roleblocker claim as scum? When I made my last post my thought was no, but now I've realised that even assuming that BBT didn't know that roleblockers blocked scum kills (and thought this was some weird variant or whatever), he could still make that post as scum in an attempt to convince everyone that this rb is what he thought was a normal roleblocker. However, one thing I do need to say is that regardless of his alignment, I don't think BBT was making up his lack of roleblocker knowledge. If he actually knew what a roleblocker was then he'd know how inconclusive All Alone's claim was and not risk getting caught out in a lie ----&gt; autolynched. I've seen town forget their role before and be caught out in a lie during massclaim. Stranger things have happened.<br>\n<br>\nSo summary is that I no longer think his thing about not knowing roleblockers is particularly alignment-relevant. The increased likelihood of being scum due to the roleblock still stands, but this is not a certain thing and I'm not going to lynch him for this reason.<br>\n<br>\nBut what do I actually think of BBT?<br>\n<br>\nThe things that most strike me upon re-ISOing him are:<br>\n-<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7246111#p7246111\">338</a>, which I still don't like. The explanation he provided in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7250870#p7250870\">582</a> also does not satisfy me entirely. It seems more of an attempt to get people to not suspect him rather than having any real town benefit.<br>\n-If BBT is scum I don't think he made the shot.<br>\nReason: I've already decided that I don't think BBT was lying about the roleblock thing. And now I've realised that upon being blocked he probably would have been reminded of the fact or looked into whether roleblockers actually commonly blocked scum kills, which I think would have discouraged BBT-scum from reacting in such a way to the claim.<br>\nSorry for my mess of thoughts regarding that, but I believe if BBT was scum that made the kill he would have taken a different, less risky approach. I'm worried I'm totally wrong but it's what I think atm.<br>\nI also think that if he had, Wanderer wouldn't have made <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7260975#p7260975\">704</a> after everyone else seemed to be assuming BBT was scum.<br>\n<br>\nMy current read on BBT is town, mostly due to the above, plus Wanderer going for All Alone (which I do suspect she would have avoided if BBT was her partner).

This would point to BBT being the attacker and AA blocked him<br>\n<br>\nIMO, the first is more likely.</div></blockquote><br>\nJarJar, my internal conflict stems from that as well as something about BBT's posting that I can't place but makes me feel he's scum. I've been worried that this is because I'm not familiar with him as a player and that my tendency to scumread him is merely playstyle-associated and an error in my own reading of him. However, I think I may have tried too hard to logic myself into some sort of townread on BBT, and this doesn't sit right.<br>\n<br>\nMy thoughts have been wildly all over the place recently and for that I apologise, though I think I've settled on:<br>\n<br>\nTOWNTOWNTOWN: All Alone, JarJar, lalalaGIRAFFE<br>\n<br>\nSlightly more town than the rest: MTD, Fro99er (pending actually answering posts from BBT and myself)<br>\n<br>\nConsidering for scum: Espeonage, DRK, Bellaphant, BBT<br>\n<br>\nCurrent guess for scumteam: Bellaphant, BBT<br>\n<br>\nHOWEVER, putting BBT here makes me slightly uncomfortable because of wanderer's posts.<br>\n<br>\nLalala, do you think I'm crazy in thinking that wanderer playing against the grain and attacking All Alone over BBT makes BBT more likely town? I'm pretty sure you're town and I like your read on BBT, though my tendency in this sort of situation would be to lynch/vig Bella who I'd feel more comfortable with dead (&lt;3 you Bella). If you tell me to vote BBT, I will though. (And this isn't an attempt to put the blame on you if he does flip town.

Unfortunately, the margins were too small and he couldn&#8217;t explain what his proof was and he never proved it before he died.<br>\n<br>\nNobody else could prove it either. For 358 years, people tried to approach it in many different ways. Finally in 1994, it was really exciting, Andrew Wiles solved it but he approached with with elliptical curves, using mathematical ideas that hadn&#8217;t been discovered in Fermat&#8217;s time. It&#8217;s unknown whether there&#8217;s a proof that could exist with only the mathematics available to Fermat. It&#8217;s possible that there isn&#8217;t and that he was mistaken.<br>\n<br>\nFermat was able to prove the special case that there are no integers a, b, and c that makes  a<sup>4</sup> + b<sup>4</sup> = c<sup>4</sup> work, but a general proof for all n, he didn&#8217;t provide it.<br>\n<br>\nYou might say &#8220;hang on a minute, what if any of a, b, and c are 0?&#8221; and you&#8217;d be right that 0<sup>4</sup> + 0<sup>4</sup> = 0<sup>4</sup>, and you&#8217;d be right that 0<sup>n</sup> + b<sup>n</sup> = c<sup>n</sup> is true for all n where b = c, but those are trivial solutions and they don&#8217;t count. a, b, and c have to be bigger than 0 and they have to be whole numbers. <br>\n<br>\na, b, and c are all bigger than 0 and n is bigger than 2.<br>\n<br>\nWe know that a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> = c<sup>2</sup> works; it&#8217;s probably one of the few things most people remember from geometry in school, and there are many solutions to that like 3<sup>2</sup> + 4<sup>2</sup> = 5<sup>2</sup>. and There are also many solutions for a<sup>1</sup> + b<sup>1</sup> = c<sup>1</sup>, for example 1 + 2 = 3. </div></div><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":!:\" title=\"Exclamation\"> <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">BlueBloodedToffee</div> (L-1): lalaladucks, All Alone, Fro99er, JarJarDrinks, Espeonage<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Bellaphant</div> (L-4): DeasVail, DeathRowKitty<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Fro99er</div> (L-5): BlueBloodedToffee<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:grey\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\"><div style=\"display:inline-flex;text-decoration:line-through\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">JarJarDrinks</div> (L-5): Espeonage</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Not Voting</div> (2):  MTD, Bellaphant<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#8040FF\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">With 10 alive, it takes 6 to lynch.<br>\n<br>\nDeadline: 291st (3*97) day of the year or in <span class=\"countdown\">(expired on 2015-10-18 14:00:00)</span>.<br>\n<br>\nLet me know if there are any problems with the VC, or if you have maths related flavour requests.<br>\n<br>\nFlavour Queue Written: Hilbert Space Filling Curve, Cauchy-Riemann equations, the Doppler effect<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: Things I haven&#8217;t rambled about yet but i&#8217;m gonna</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\">more about the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture, P vs NP, more figurate numbers, Hodge conjecture, Yang-Mills existence and mass gap, Mandelbrot Set, Complex Analysis, Lattice Multiplication, miscellaneous numberphile and vihart videos, practical numbers, hilbert numbers, leyland numbers, fibonacci numbers, jacobsthal numbers, pell numbers, pell-lucas numbers, leonardo numbers, perrin numbers, polite numbers, Erd&#337;s&#8211;Woods numbers, vampire numbers, Recursion and Mafia, Abelian groups and semigroups, noncommutative operations, the 68-95-99.7 rule, fro99er&#8217;s first theorem, euler&#8217;s perfect equation</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\nMod notes: Today is the 284th day of the year. 2<sup>2</sup>*71.

My wagon is so, so easy for scum to jump on because of the basis of it. Anti wouldn't have let this wagon go through and he was one of the louder voices in the town - that's why he is dead. Look at the game from a scum!BBT perspective - at end of D2 all of you, All Alone, Lala and Fro99er thought I was scum - why the fuck would I leave you all alive and KILL the person who would have defended me? Killing Anti is a fucking awful move if I'm scum and I would like to think I'm better than that.<br>\n<br>\n3) No. Killing All Alone takes one vote away from my wagon - why would scum want that? They know All Alone is coming into the day and voting me - no matter what. He has barely even interacted with anyone else, he is no danger to scum.

A Kochy-Riemann snowflake! I wrote this joke all by myself. It&#8217;s funny because it&#8217;s a pun.<br>\n<br>\nThe Cauchy-Riemann equations are a system of two partial differential equations. If a function is complex differentiable, it satisfies the Cauchy-Riemann equations, which means it&#8217;s holomorphic. <br>\n<br>\nThis means that for every point in the function, from whichever direction in the complex plane that you approach it, you can take the derivative. <br>\n<br>\n&#948;u/&#948;x = &#948;v/&#948;y and &#948;u/&#948;y = -&#948;v/&#948;x<br>\n<br>\nThis means the derivative of u with respect to x is equal to the derivative of v with respect to y, and derivative of u with respect to y is equal to minus derived of v with respect to x.<br>\n<br>\nSatisfying the Cauchy-Riemann equations is only the first step. In order for it to be complex differentiable, u and v also need to be real differentiable. <br>\n<br>\nAn example thing that is not complex differentiable is a Koch snowflake. <br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d9/KochFlake.svg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"><br>\n<br>\nThe reason it&#8217;s not complex differentiable is it has all those pointy bits. You can&#8217;t take the derivative at those pointy bits because they&#8217;re not smooth; they direction it is going changes abruptly. <br>\n<br>\nIt has a Hausdorff dimension of log 4/ log 3. <br>\n<br>\n </div></div><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":!:\" title=\"Exclamation\"> <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">BlueBloodedToffee</div> (L-1): lalaladucks, All Alone, JarJarDrinks, Espeonage, Fro99er<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Bellaphant</div> (L-4): DeasVail, DeathRowKitty<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Fro99er</div> (L-5): BlueBloodedToffee<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Not Voting</div> (2):  MTD, Bellaphant, <div style=\"display:inline;color:grey\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\"><div style=\"display:inline-flex;text-decoration:line-through\">Fro99er</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#8040FF\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">With 10 alive, it takes 6 to lynch.<br>\n<br>\nDeadline: 291st (3*97) day of the year or in <span class=\"countdown\">(expired on 2015-10-18 14:00:00)</span>.<br>\n<br>\nLet me know if there are any problems with the VC, or if you have maths related flavour requests.<br>\n<br>\nFlavour Queue Written: the Doppler effect<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: Things I haven&#8217;t rambled about yet but i&#8217;m gonna</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\">more about the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture, P vs NP, more figurate numbers, Hodge conjecture, Yang-Mills existence and mass gap, Mandelbrot Set, Complex Analysis, Lattice Multiplication, miscellaneous numberphile and vihart videos, practical numbers, hilbert numbers, leyland numbers, fibonacci numbers, jacobsthal numbers, pell numbers, pell-lucas numbers, leonardo numbers, perrin numbers, polite numbers, Erd&#337;s&#8211;Woods numbers, vampire numbers, Recursion and Mafia, Abelian groups and semigroups, noncommutative operations, the 68-95-99.7 rule, fro99er&#8217;s first theorem, euler&#8217;s perfect equation</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\nMod notes: Today is the 284th day of the year. 2<sup>2</sup>*71.</div></div></fieldset>", "time": "Sun Oct 11, 2015 2:19 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=63443&start=1175", "forum": "53", "thread": "63443"}

These numbers are untouchable. The number 5 is untouchable because 1 + 4 is the only way to write it as the sum of distinct positive integers including 1. 1 has to be included because it is a divisor of every number. Any number that is divisible by 4 is also divisible by 2, so it would be 1 + 2 + 4 but that&#8217;s 7 not 5. <br>\n<br>\n2 is also untouchable because you can&#8217;t write it as the sum of distinct positive integers period.<br>\n<br>\nOther untouchable numbers are 52, 88, 96, 120, 124&#8230;<br>\n<br>\nIt is possible that 5 is the only odd untouchable number, but this hasn&#8217;t been proven.

It was tremendous fun watching you guys play and it helped give me enthusiasm back for my own game at a time when I was feeling a bit burnt out on playing mafia myself. Aside from the 1, essentially pre-game replacement of SithLord who confirmed but never picked up the day 1 start PM, you guys all stayed with me from the beginning and I appreciate that a lot!<br>\n<br>\nThank you to <div style=\"display:inline;color:#008080\">Panther</div>, <div style=\"display:inline;color:#8000FF\">pistachi0n</div>, <div style=\"display:inline;color:#4000FF\">goodmorning</div>, <div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF00\">herrcombs</div>, and <div style=\"display:inline;color:#400040\">mala</div> for joining in my replacement queue and I'm sorry you guys didn't get to play!<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF00\">Froggyfrog</div>, thanks for replacing in! You played really well and I loved your silliness. I liked the way you responded to DV after you'd been so excited about your plan and found a way to work together with the town and explain your ideas to other people in the end.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF80FF\">Bella</div>, you're great and I'm really glad you neighbourised frogger. I'm sorry I couldn't have made you scum but maybe next time! I was also impressed that you held back your vig shot, which I felt was the protown thing to do, to wait until later when you were sure and had stronger reads, because when balancing it I was pretty sure the vig would just shoot town night 1. You didn't; you used your head.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#0000BF\">Espy</div>, you're so awesome and I'm glad you joined this. I like your playstyle.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF4000\">Anti</div>, you're awesome and thank you for posting twilight/harry potter fanfic to help me get to page tops and for playing in my game even though you had to solo. Your reads were really good and it was really fun having you.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#0040FF\">Bubbletea</div>, it was really impressive watching you play and keep trying even as one thing went wrong after another. I would have probably given up long before you did, but you were a really good sport about it. You guys got really unlucky night1 with the combination of hitting DV's bulletproof and all alone roleblocking scum who didn't do the kill, but even after that there were moments where I thought you might pull it off anyway. You played really well.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#80BFFF\">Wanderer-nl</div>, same goes to you. It was great having you and I loved watching you play.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#BF0080\">pirate mollie</div>, I'm really sorry you didn't have fun in this game and I wish it could have been fun for you.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#00FFFF\">All Alone</div>, I am seriously impressed with you. You have really good scumdar and good reads and you're one of the best people who could have got the role of roleblocker. I think people underestimate you because of your low postcount playstyle and recent join date, use that to your advantage <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smiling.png\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":]\" title=\"Cheerful Smile\"><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#80BF40\">DeasVail</div>, it was great getting to know you and watching you play. You're really good at looking town and it was really clever how you played bulletproof on day 1. The scumteam thought you were crumbing doc with your comments to mollie so I was surprised when you said masons with JarJar but I could see that too when I went back and looked. Either way it was really great! I loved your sense of humour also. You're great! <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#800040\">MTD</div>, I really appreciate how you stuck it through to the end because I would have 100% started twilight trolling before I even got to L-1. You were in an unwinnable position but you kept trying anyway and that's impressive. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#008040\">DRK</div>, you are so great and I wanted to edit &lt;3 into all of your maths posts and wanted to ramble at you about mathematics everytime you posted but I couldn't because I was the mod but you were great and I love the way you write and think.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#80FF40\">ducky</div>, you were probably the best person who could have been innocent child. I loved your silliness this game and giving everyone fun names and you managed to look pushable throughout the whole game and keep the scumteam thinking they could push your lynch without looking so scummy that they'd push you day1/2 and force you to reveal sooner than neccessary. You did great!<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#404080\">JarJar</div>, this was your first game out of Rome and I feel like it may have been a difficult one since almost everybody else already knew everybody else and you were kinda by yourself which is a hard situation to be in, but in spite of that you managed to be really active and shared your ideas with people and I think you did really well. Thanks for sticking with it and I feel like your play improved a lot over the course of the game. It was a pleasure watching you play and I wish you luck in your future games!<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: normal; display: inline\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#8040FF\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Coming up next:</div></div></div><br>\nProbably my <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7280442#p7280442\" class=\"postlink\">everybody's a bodyguard</a> setup in the micro queue with \"Slavic songs i like\" for flavour and my \"Get a Room\" mechanic tacked onto it (basically if 2 people are having or need to have a discussion that nobody else cares about they can be told to get a room and are given a neighbourhood to work out their differences in + 48 hour post restriction that they can't talk to or about each other in the thread.)<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: normal; display: inline\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#8040FF\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Thanks for playing everyone &lt;3</div></div></div>", "time": "Thu Oct 15, 2015 6:22 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=63443&start=1450", "forum": "53", "thread": "63443"}
