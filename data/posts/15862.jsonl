Days on this website do not generally go along a quick, linear line to a lynch. Just because the first bandwagon of the day has formed on you does not mean you are going to be lynched. <br><br>You didn't ruin your game by claiming VT. It isn't really even scummy. If you are scum and you claim VT it is hardly much of a defense, you'll probably get lynched anyway. It is anti-town if you are a vanilla townie, because it narrows don't the pool of players with power roles that the scum have to hunt for, but it doesn't make you scum. It isn't good play, but you weren't going to get lynched straight away for it, and if you followed on from that by being pro-town pretty much all would be forgiven. <br><br>Now asking to be lynched is, I think, a null tell: it plays towards no win condition, and unless we are looking at your meta and it is very out-of-character it doesn't say too much about your alignment. Do you usually get so defeatist when playing games like this? <br><br>Your posting has, however, made you a pretty attractive lynch. Yes, players found you scummy enough to want to start a bandwagon on. Then you flipped out, and it hasn't exactly gained you any favors with the rest of the town. Take a step back. Ask some questions to those voting for you, or show that there is a better case on somebody else. Your top scum pick is ArielT: go through their posts, use quotes from them to build a case. Ask them to ask you questions; answer them."}

Whether you agree with his read is besides the point....the fact is he gave it.  <span class=\"noboldsig\">So you have targetted A94 for not answering questions or taking a stance (which IMO he did both of) in lieu of voting tylerj who he (Zyrco) suspected at one point (but never backed off those suspicions that I can see) and who committed the actual offense that Zyrco was accusing 4pc of (in post 118 &amp; quoted above).</span>  Why does tylerj get off the hook when 4pc doesn't?  <br><br>I also took into consideration some of the other's suspicions toward Zyrco (namely Parama's buddying accusation) and I did not care for you speaking for others or your lining up lynches (post 135).  I can see you suspecting two players but to line them up regardless of thier flips is ridiculous.  You appear to have given no thought to the fact 4pc was town when you were linking him with A94.  You seem to just be mindlessly going forward with you lynch progression.  <br><br>@Zyrco...could you elaborate on your tylerj position and why he is not a better lynch today than A94?<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">tl;dr:</span>  I still like my tylerjarvis vote and <span class=\"noboldsig\">FOS Zyrco</span>."}

Get over it.  <span class=\"noboldsig\">Your main point against a94 is not valid.</span><br><br><blockquote><div><cite> Zyrco wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite> havingfitz wrote:</cite><span class=\"noboldsig\">So you have targetted A94 for not answering questions or taking a stance (which IMO he did both of) in lieu of voting tylerj who he (Zyrco) suspected at one point (but never backed off those suspicions that I can see) and who committed the actual offense that Zyrco was accusing 4pc of (in post 118 &amp; quoted above).</span></div></blockquote><br>The duration of the tyler wagon before 4pc's attempted hammer was 20 hours, the duration of the 4pc wagon was 6 days 5 hours(and ended with Parama begging for a lynch to be made and most of the rest of us AFKing for holidays). You think these offenses are the exact same?</div></blockquote><br>The duration the wagons existed is beside the point.  The <span class=\"noboldsig\">fact</span> is that you condemned 4pc for ~hammering tylerj \u201cinstantly\" and not allowing discussion to take place.  The tj wagon was over the holidays and participation was limited.  The fact it was 6 days does not mean there was ample discussion going on.  And the D1 deadline wasn\u2019t until yesterday!  We had plenty of time to allow people to return.  Who cares if Parama was begging for a lynch.  That doesn\u2019t make tylerj\u2019s hammer any more acceptable.  As for a94\u2019s comments that the wagon had shifted so quickly from tj to 4pc (indicating there was scum involved)....it did shift almost instantly (at least in the context of this game).  <br><br>4pc\u2019s wagon (L-6)  changed to (L-2) in less than seven hours. Once the tylerj wagon exodus began.  In this game that is an instant.  It was a quicklynch in progress.  And the four votes that gave 4pc\u2019s wagon the quick buildup from L-6 to L-2 were brokenscraps, Sundy, Zyrconium and the dearly departed Parama.  <br><br>Guaranteed there is at least one scum in that group of three living players (brokenscraps, Sundy, Zyrconium).

My impression is that Z has been very busy defending from fritz, and you are just trying to slowly and cautiously backtrack (\"I am inclined\", \"I might be inclined\", \"should go nowhere\"...).

I never said the case against Trendall \"should go nowhere.\" I said \"if the Trendall case goes nowhere (and it should),\" meaning that the case should go somewhere.

Don't put words into my mouth, it's anti-town at best and scummy at worst. I said he was suspicious for not responding, but Trendall is far more guilty on this account, hence my continued vote.

NK speculation is possible (it's the difference between a good doctor and a bad doctor). If the town looks zero at night kill then it gives scum free reign to lynch whoever they want, so it generally advisable to use it if something stands out. <br><br>Parama didn't stand out as a night kill, he has a rep for being a good player and people listen to him. <br><br>Sundy stood out to me as they weren't obviously pro-town in the way Parama was. So that Sundy is now dead suggest the scum had some other reason for killing them, and even if nothing comes from it I think it is useful to look at. <br><br>Sundy did indeed suspect me which is worth looking at. I don't think me being Sundy's top choice for lynch was it alone though as this seems a pretty poor way to put suspicion on a player and get them lynched."}

In addition to Nacho\u2019s avoidance of this game since he joined my main suspicions towards tj are his own D1 play (which I gave reasons for when I voted him) and what I perceive as blatant bussing by Zyrco\u2026i.e. Zyrco expressed suspicions towards tj but did not follow through as evidenced by his hop from tj to 4pc D1 and leapfrog of suspicions to a94 on D2.    <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>brokenscraps wrote:</cite>No-lynch today means we will have more information without being in a worse position in-regards to \"days till losing\". <br><br><span style=\"font-family: 'courier new',monospace;\">Lynch both days:... 2/8, 2/6, lose<br>No-lynch tomorrow:. 2/8, ---, 2/5, lose<br>No-lynch today:.... ---, 2/7, 2/5, lose</span><br><br>The fractions are our chances of hitting scum, hitting scum improves our winning but no-lynch is still the best statistically (unless we had an obviously town player, which we don't). <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>hf wrote:</cite>A no-lynch just gives scum a free kill tonight.

That\u2019s when odds of hitting scum are worst.  I would rather take advantage of the pro-town players still here and their opinions than take a pass when we don\u2019t have to so scum can eliminate a town asset.  If we mislynch today I\u2019d be all for a no lynch in MYLO.  Whether they are town or scum\u2026I think it\u2019s a pretty safe bet to assume kiku, a94, bs, and Nacho are going to avoid a nk.  Rather than drag out suspicions to tomorrow of what appears to be the four players getting the most attention ATM\u2026I think taking a chance at hitting the 1 or 2 scum potentially within that group is our best play.  For me order of preference would be Nacho&lt;bs=kiku&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; and a94 a distant last.  This isn't necessarily my top four suspects...just the four I think would be best to lynch today.  If I had to choose between lew and a94 I\u2019d rather have a lew lynch because 1) if a94 and lew were both town\u2026.IMO a94 would be more likely to avoid a nk and 2) personally I suspect lew more.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>lewarcher82 wrote:</cite>all in all, Sundy's death still bothers me.

A nk that gets rid of a very town player or a PR is icing on the cake.  It\u2019s WIFOM.  If you don\u2019t agree with me fine.  The fact you keep bringing nk WIFOM up makes me think you want us to consider it in the light you are seeing it in (ie that it highlights Sundy\u2019s suspicions towards bs and/or it makes my [and Prana's, etc] continued existence also cause for suspicion).    <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>lewarcher82 wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>fitz wrote:</cite>scum could have been hoping to hit a PR, scum may have worried about a more preferred target receiving protection like from a doc or jailkeeper(?), or scum could be trying to mess with us.</div></blockquote><br>Bullshit.

As for your comment about me being an ideal target\u2026that plays right into my comment about scum avoiding a protected player.  If I am an ideal target as you say\u2026scum would be taking a chance at wasting a kill if they think any possible protective role in the game feels the same way you do.

Deal with it, at least one of the players that are being trusted by town is scum, and if people payed more attention to this game they would understand the risk."}

I'm not sure about everyone in this game but I doubt for example that andrew would be planning too much big with the night kill considering his lack of involvement in the day phases; he wouldn't be able to take advantage of it. Of course I can imagine the other scum taking a dominant role in NK choice so this doesn't prove much. <br><br>It seems likely though that the killing of the lurker was a more thought about decision though. You can work at cutting off reasons why others weren't lynched. <br><br>It could be that hf was off on his scum-reads; scum-PD for example could keep hf around as protection and a hunting tool given hf's influence atm. <br><br>It could be that leaving certain players alive or making certain players dead was used for framing; for example you've used hf being alive and Sundy being dead as a case on hf and me. <br><br>It could be that making some of the alignments on the Zyrc lynch known made it easier to put suspicion on players.

If not all we have is your word that you weren't bussing Zyrc in your usual manner, which I'm sure you can appreciate isn't worth that much. <br><br>As for Nacho:<br>-Nacho's posts are fairly null. Tunneling of kiku, fluff and not much else. Main suspicious thing is that he is voting and tunneling kiku long before his presented case and when it does arrive it depends entirely on Zyrc's scumflip. He seems to imply he has more but we haven't seen it and without the additional bits which don't rely on post-flip info the case look fake to me, a real case would've existed when the tunneling started and not a game day later. The failure to provide anything extra in terms of a case leads into the next point:<br>-Nacho is avoiding this game. He had posted extensively elsewhere but still no sign of him in this topic. This is not typical behavior. It is a little null since it is so damning no matter what your alignment, but scum usually benefit more from unnoticed lurking more than town. Nacho as scum does do things to confuse town, so this may be one of those things. <br>-tyler starts first day very defensive and then dedicates pretty much the rest of the day to defense, which is consistent with his <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=11&amp;t=15802&amp;start=0\" class=\"postlink\">behavior as scum</a>; unfortunately I don't think he has completed a game as town, so I can't tell if this is usual or scummy behavior. Without meta to clear him it is scummy, he post zero pro-town content except for copied opinions then manages to opportunistically slip in to complete the mislynch.<br>-Zero town-tells is pretty amazing for two separate town players which makes accepting this slot as town a little difficult for me. <br>-Some of the interactions with Zyrc seem a little off post-flip:<br><blockquote><div><cite>Zyrc wrote:</cite>tyler, claiming VT is, as bs(I'll not capitalise it to be less insulting, but there's no way I'm typing a whole name, lazyness) said, not very scummy(probably not at all given the context you did it in), but kinda harmful to town. However it's a lot more hurtful to town to let yourself get lynched, I suggest you find start trying to win, which means finding someone ACTUALLY scummy, and making some valid points, cause I REALLY don't think you actually believe your case on AT(you could make a better case on her(no gender listed means I get to guess) too, I guess, but that requires you to find it).</div></blockquote><br><blockquote><div><cite>Zyrc wrote:</cite>tyler should also comment on Ariel's most recent posts, no matter what else of my advice(or whatever that was) he takes.</div></blockquote><br>Reads as coaching; all votes and suspicions also seem quite forced and disingenuous."}

That's too early in the wagon for two scum to hop on as it's not a sure thing the wagon will go, so scum will keep off it and just nudge it along a bit, or drop the hammer. Which leads to kiku and tyler. So I would say that scum is definitely between those two. As I'm also less sure of kiku scum at the moment, it means I'm more certain of a nacho scum there.<br><br>As for the second wagon, I'm more happy with the view that andrew94 is scum on that one if there was just one scum on it.

If I get lynched I'll flip town, that doesn't automatically mean \"brokenscraps is scum\" unless I had said \"I'm a cop and have a guilty\", which I haven't, I've just suspected him. Ditto the other way. Town are entitled to be wrong, in fact averages state that town will be wrong more times than they are right. Even in a game they win. Because suspicion needs to be everywhere, and you should trust no-one. So just because someone being pushed by Person A flips town doesn't instantly mean Person A is scum themselves. It could just be town getting a bad read.<br><br>So no, I wouldn't say brokenscraps flip will tell you anything about me, nor vice-versa. Nor do I understand why you would believe that."}

Tunneling of kiku, fluff and not much else. Main suspicious thing is that he is voting and tunneling kiku long before his presented case and when it does arrive it depends entirely on Zyrc's scumflip. He seems to imply he has more but we haven't seen it and without the additional bits which don't rely on post-flip info the case look fake to me, a real case would've existed when the tunneling started and not a game day later. The failure to provide anything extra in terms of a case leads into the next point:<br>-Nacho is avoiding this game. He had posted extensively elsewhere but still no sign of him in this topic. This is not typical behavior. It is a little null since it is so damning no matter what your alignment, but scum usually benefit more from unnoticed lurking more than town. Nacho as scum does do things to confuse town, so this may be one of those things. <br>-tyler starts first day very defensive and then dedicates pretty much the rest of the day to defense, which is consistent with his <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=11&amp;t=15802&amp;start=0\" class=\"postlink\">behavior as scum</a>; unfortunately I don't think he has completed a game as town, so I can't tell if this is usual or scummy behavior. Without meta to clear him it is scummy, he post zero pro-town content except for copied opinions then manages to opportunistically slip in to complete the mislynch.<br>-Zero town-tells is pretty amazing for two separate town players which makes accepting this slot as town a little difficult for me. <br>-Some of the interactions with Zyrc seem a little off post-flip:<br><blockquote><div><cite>Zyrc wrote:</cite>tyler, claiming VT is, as bs(I'll not capitalise it to be less insulting, but there's no way I'm typing a whole name, lazyness) said, not very scummy(probably not at all given the context you did it in), but kinda harmful to town. However it's a lot more hurtful to town to let yourself get lynched, I suggest you find start trying to win, which means finding someone ACTUALLY scummy, and making some valid points, cause I REALLY don't think you actually believe your case on AT(you could make a better case on her(no gender listed means I get to guess) too, I guess, but that requires you to find it).</div></blockquote><br><blockquote><div><cite>Zyrc wrote:</cite>tyler should also comment on Ariel's most recent posts, no matter what else of my advice(or whatever that was) he takes.</div></blockquote><br>Reads as coaching; all votes and suspicions also seem quite forced and disingenuous.</div></blockquote>"}

The problem is that people are trying to make it looks as though I am saying things that I am not actually saying. Every lynch is informative depending on the flip.

This is what the fallacia consequentis is about.<br><br>If it is not clear to you how this applies to broken, there are two things we can do. The first is going to play bowling cuz it is definitely simpler than mafia, the second is considering a different example. Me, for instance. Anyone betting on the fact that I am scum seems convinced that my lynch will be informative. But what happens if I flip town -which I would-? Will you automatically lynch anyone fosing me? Evidently not. Then if I say for instance \"if broken is scum then prana is likely town\" this does not imply the sentence \"if broken is town prana is likely scum\". Saying that I said so is misrepping.<br><br>Interestingly enough, making my observations sound more conclusive than they are was the very same strategy poor child Zyrco tried to use against me on day2.

It was a response to why no-lynching from the start of the game would've been pointless. You disputed this on the grounds that Parama was on a fail wagon when the only people not on the fail wagon were ArielT, who was vote-parking a random vote and had gained some suspicions, Pinewolf, who was lurking like hell, Lateralus, who had claimed PGO, and you, someone who had gained suspicions. Therefore being on the mislynch wagon wasn't an especially strong reason for a player who was otherwise a threat to mafia to cease being a threat to mafia."}

However you did make me think in regards to the voting someone and then demanding a claim. I never really thought much of it before as I just saw it as \"you're at L-1, so you have to claim\", but in truth, there's no evidence another player is going to hop on the wagon, at 5 to lynch it's entirely plausible that 4 people find a player scummy, and the other 4 are of the view they're obv town (while the missing player is the one being voted, obviously). So to that end, hopping on a wagon (or being on a wagon) and demanding a claim is much better for scum as they can get a claim and then either stick on it if it's a VT claim, or leave saying they believe the claim if it's a PR, and they've successfully outed said role. So yeah, thanks for making me think about that a bit more.<br><br>Also, in regards to this game, something I can bring up now. I have just recently finished modding Mutiny On The High Seas in mini-themes (check out the intro vid, seriously <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\";)\" title=\"Wink\">), and two of the scum spent almost the entire game at each others throats purely because they started distancing, and didn't reel themselves back in quickly enough, leaving them being forced to argue, and argue, and argue. To the point they had no choice but to vote each other at times, and make sure they were pushing each other ridiculously hard.<br><br>I saw that quite clearly in Zyrco and Andrew, which is one of the additional reasons I have such a strong conviction about them being joint scum. It screamed to me of distancing, and then not stopping early enough.<br><br>So yeah, back to andrew for the lynch.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">vote: andrew94</span><br><br>I'm also seeing somewhat of a similarity between my previous play in my earlier referenced game with fitz in Nacho (saying that you'll say more, and somehow always avoiding it).

Now if we assume that on each of the mislynches there's at least one scum, it means it's between kiku, broken and myself. Obviously I know it wasn't me, which means it's one of them (It can't be both, as I doubt all three scum would be on the day 1 wagon).<br><br>With Zyrconium's lynch, I expect at least one scum to bus him. We previously deduced it can't be kiku. But I'm not so sure now, I'll get to that shortly.<br><br>Nacho's lynch has to have one scum on it. The only way that's not possible is if the only scum on 4computer's wagon was Zyrc, and I'm not buying that. I'm not scum, so that leaves us on kiku and broken.<br><br>If we assume kiku is town based on her day 2 vote shift onto Zyrc, that leaves broken. This also means that every single wagon has had zero scum from the halfway point, and the day 2 wagon has either andrew at the start as scum and no scum elsewhere. Or no scum at all. I'm not buying that.<br><br>It would also mean that Zyrc and broken voted 4computer in quick succession, and just prayed town followed up on the lynch. Is anyone buying that? I'm not either. As a note, if I'm scum, it would mean that I either have to be scum with kiku, or 2 (or 3 if you count broken) scum voted at the start of the day phase, and relied on town to see the lynch through.<br><br>This means that the only solid scum we have at this stage is kiku. Based on all the wagons it makes more sense that kiku is scum on them all over anyone else.<br><br>I highly doubt kiku and broken are scum together due to the day 1 wagon. If I wasn't in this slot I could see an argument for a kiku/prana team so I'll consent that some might pull that up, but I guess my only argument to that would lead to a WIFOM \"why would I point all this out otherwise?\"<br><br>This leaves our final scum to be between Xtoxm and andrew94. I've been saying it's andrew all game, and he's not done anything to convince me otherwise (like, y'know, actuall scum hunt) but by the same token, Xtoxm (and his predecessors) have been curiously away from every actual lynch.<br><br>But at this stage I'm as close to certain that kiku is scum."}

I have seen day 1 wagons with zero scum, one scum, two scum on front, two scum on back, three scum, and everything in between. Read the votes, look at the reasoning. Town usually lynches town on day 1. Scum rarely push hard on a day one wagon. Also, broken's jump is oppurtunistic. All you are doing is saying \"That can't be possible\", when it is, in fact, highly probable, and most likely when looking at the thread as a whole. You're getting wierd man. You do realize that if I were scum with Zyrc, not only would it mean that I bussed the roleblocker hard, but that the roleblocker random voted me(oldest scumtell on the wiki), and I nightkilled the one and only player I could have locked into a 1 v. 1 with in lylo.

I believed the Vengeful would try to kill himself as early as possible to avoid being nightkilled.<br><br>I strongly believed the Mafia would win until Night 5. When they killed the Cop N1 with a lucky shot I was like \"game over,\" even when the town recovered a little by lynching the Mafia RB D2. However, both sides' play dropped somewhat the next few days and nights (Zyrc was definitely the most active scum player, I must admit), and a lurkerkill followed by a lurker lynch were not the best decisions IMO. Havingfitz was the right kill (and IMO should have been the N2 kill) because he was definitely the most obvtownie player in the game, plus he was the Doctor. PranaDevil was the next-most obvtown player, and I have absolutely no clue why the scum let him live to LyLo. I fully expected Prana to be the N5 kill, and my jaw dropped when it was andrew, who (as I noted in the dead QT several times) was by far the most easily manipulated or easily mislynched player. The only explanation I can think of is that Prana suspected Xtoxm somewhat D5 and Xtoxm was attempting to frame Prana, which was inadvisable considering that Prana and kiku cross-voted in LyLo as he himself noted.<br><br>I would like to thank Xtoxm a lot for filling into a slot that was causing me considerable difficulty and playing it both fairly actively and well to the end of the game. Despite the setbacks and shortcomings of activity, I feel this was a pretty good first modded game for me."}

I figured if I can convince whoever was left as scum (in this case you) to leave you and Andrew around, and try and push a mislynch on the wrong one, I could use the gambit easier. That broken and myself both survived I was starting to second guess myself. So I almost did go for the long winded scum hunting stuff.
