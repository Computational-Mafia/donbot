Days on this website do not generally go along a quick, linear line to a lynch. Just because the first bandwagon of the day has formed on you does not mean you are going to be lynched. <br>\n<br>\nYou didn't ruin your game by claiming VT. It isn't really even scummy. If you are scum and you claim VT it is hardly much of a defense, you'll probably get lynched anyway. It is anti-town if you are a vanilla townie, because it narrows don't the pool of players with power roles that the scum have to hunt for, but it doesn't make you scum. It isn't good play, but you weren't going to get lynched straight away for it, and if you followed on from that by being pro-town pretty much all would be forgiven. <br>\n<br>\nNow asking to be lynched is, I think, a null tell: it plays towards no win condition, and unless we are looking at your meta and it is very out-of-character it doesn't say too much about your alignment. Do you usually get so defeatist when playing games like this? <br>\n<br>\nYour posting has, however, made you a pretty attractive lynch. Yes, players found you scummy enough to want to start a bandwagon on. Then you flipped out, and it hasn't exactly gained you any favors with the rest of the town. Take a step back. Ask some questions to those voting for you, or show that there is a better case on somebody else. Your top scum pick is ArielT: go through their posts, use quotes from them to build a case.

I agree he's been acting erratically this entire time, but at this point, I am surprisingly conflicted.

If you were unable to comprehend a94's posts to determine his stance that is not his problem.  <br>\n<br>\nAlso, you failed to respond to my question in #180 asking why you held 4pc to such suspicion for his almost-hammer on tylerj while you have not said one thing about tylerj's successful hammer on 4pc which demonstrated that tylerj was \"willing to kill him instantly, without discussing anything else or allowing anyone else to do so, discussion is the town's greatest weapon and you're actions seem designed to remove it as much as possible,\"  Sound familiar?

Does that count as \"ANYTHING?\"  (btw...why the random caps?)<br>\n<br>\nAlso...which cases are you referring to that are scummy?  Why are said cases scummy and not pro-town? <br>\n<br>\nFor you to assume any cases on tylerj are scummy you must think they are scum driven (while conveniently not ruling out that tylerj could be scum although he hasn't done \"ANYTHING\" lately).  <br>\n<br>\nSo who was on the scummy wagon (6) on tylerj......well....there were two townies, parama and 4pc.

In post 126 a94 says he think tylerj is scum because of the way the leading wagon shifted so quickly from tylerj to 4pc...which I (and IMO any competent player) would infer to mean he does not believe 4pc is scum.  Combined with the fact he called 4pc town in post 95 and had not posted anything to change that view (that I can find)...the inference from post 126 is obvious.  He made a stance.  Get over it.  <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Your main point against a94 is not valid.</div><br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite> Zyrco wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite> havingfitz wrote:</cite><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">So you have targetted A94 for not answering questions or taking a stance (which IMO he did both of) in lieu of voting tylerj who he (Zyrco) suspected at one point (but never backed off those suspicions that I can see) and who committed the actual offense that Zyrco was accusing 4pc of (in post 118 &amp; quoted above).</div></div></blockquote>\nThe duration of the tyler wagon before 4pc's attempted hammer was 20 hours, the duration of the 4pc wagon was 6 days 5 hours(and ended with Parama begging for a lynch to be made and most of the rest of us AFKing for holidays). You think these offenses are the exact same?</div></blockquote>\nThe duration the wagons existed is beside the point.  The <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">fact</div> is that you condemned 4pc for ~hammering tylerj &#8220;instantly\" and not allowing discussion to take place.  The tj wagon was over the holidays and participation was limited.  The fact it was 6 days does not mean there was ample discussion going on.  And the D1 deadline wasn&#8217;t until yesterday!  We had plenty of time to allow people to return.  Who cares if Parama was begging for a lynch.  That doesn&#8217;t make tylerj&#8217;s hammer any more acceptable.  As for a94&#8217;s comments that the wagon had shifted so quickly from tj to 4pc (indicating there was scum involved)....it did shift almost instantly (at least in the context of this game).  <br>\n<br>\n4pc&#8217;s wagon (L-6)  changed to (L-2) in less than seven hours. Once the tylerj wagon exodus began.  In this game that is an instant.  It was a quicklynch in progress.  And the four votes that gave 4pc&#8217;s wagon the quick buildup from L-6 to L-2 were brokenscraps, Sundy, Zyrconium and the dearly departed Parama.  <br>\n<br>\nGuaranteed there is at least one scum in that group of three living players (brokenscraps, Sundy, Zyrconium).

Where you said if one of me or fitz are scum, it would be more likely to me. However you've gone on to say that if fitz is town scum would take him out because he's dangerous. Meaning if I were scum I would have taken him out. While scum would be inclined to leave me alive because I was being called scummy by \"someone\" (kiku I think you'll find).

If I'm scum and not fitz, you, yourself, have said scum would take out fitz.

Rather than drag out suspicions to tomorrow of what appears to be the four players getting the most attention ATM&#8230;I think taking a chance at hitting the 1 or 2 scum potentially within that group is our best play.  For me order of preference would be Nacho&lt;bs=kiku&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; and a94 a distant last.  This isn't necessarily my top four suspects...just the four I think would be best to lynch today.  If I had to choose between lew and a94 I&#8217;d rather have a lew lynch because 1) if a94 and lew were both town&#8230;.IMO a94 would be more likely to avoid a nk and 2) personally I suspect lew more.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>lewarcher82 wrote:</cite>all in all, Sundy's death still bothers me.

I'm not sure about everyone in this game but I doubt for example that andrew would be planning too much big with the night kill considering his lack of involvement in the day phases; he wouldn't be able to take advantage of it. Of course I can imagine the other scum taking a dominant role in NK choice so this doesn't prove much. <br>\n<br>\nIt seems likely though that the killing of the lurker was a more thought about decision though. You can work at cutting off reasons why others weren't lynched. <br>\n<br>\nIt could be that hf was off on his scum-reads; scum-PD for example could keep hf around as protection and a hunting tool given hf's influence atm. <br>\n<br>\nIt could be that leaving certain players alive or making certain players dead was used for framing; for example you've used hf being alive and Sundy being dead as a case on hf and me. <br>\n<br>\nIt could be that making some of the alignments on the Zyrc lynch known made it easier to put suspicion on players.

Tunneling of kiku, fluff and not much else. Main suspicious thing is that he is voting and tunneling kiku long before his presented case and when it does arrive it depends entirely on Zyrc's scumflip. He seems to imply he has more but we haven't seen it and without the additional bits which don't rely on post-flip info the case look fake to me, a real case would've existed when the tunneling started and not a game day later. The failure to provide anything extra in terms of a case leads into the next point:<br>\n-Nacho is avoiding this game. He had posted extensively elsewhere but still no sign of him in this topic. This is not typical behavior. It is a little null since it is so damning no matter what your alignment, but scum usually benefit more from unnoticed lurking more than town.

That's too early in the wagon for two scum to hop on as it's not a sure thing the wagon will go, so scum will keep off it and just nudge it along a bit, or drop the hammer. Which leads to kiku and tyler. So I would say that scum is definitely between those two. As I'm also less sure of kiku scum at the moment, it means I'm more certain of a nacho scum there.<br>\n<br>\nAs for the second wagon, I'm more happy with the view that andrew94 is scum on that one if there was just one scum on it.

If I get lynched I'll flip town, that doesn't automatically mean \"brokenscraps is scum\" unless I had said \"I'm a cop and have a guilty\", which I haven't, I've just suspected him. Ditto the other way. Town are entitled to be wrong, in fact averages state that town will be wrong more times than they are right. Even in a game they win. Because suspicion needs to be everywhere, and you should trust no-one. So just because someone being pushed by Person A flips town doesn't instantly mean Person A is scum themselves.

The problem is that people are trying to make it looks as though I am saying things that I am not actually saying. Every lynch is informative depending on the flip.

The first is going to play bowling cuz it is definitely simpler than mafia, the second is considering a different example. Me, for instance. Anyone betting on the fact that I am scum seems convinced that my lynch will be informative. But what happens if I flip town -which I would-? Will you automatically lynch anyone fosing me?

It was a response to why no-lynching from the start of the game would've been pointless. You disputed this on the grounds that Parama was on a fail wagon when the only people not on the fail wagon were ArielT, who was vote-parking a random vote and had gained some suspicions, Pinewolf, who was lurking like hell, Lateralus, who had claimed PGO, and you, someone who had gained suspicions.

However you did make me think in regards to the voting someone and then demanding a claim. I never really thought much of it before as I just saw it as \"you're at L-1, so you have to claim\", but in truth, there's no evidence another player is going to hop on the wagon, at 5 to lynch it's entirely plausible that 4 people find a player scummy, and the other 4 are of the view they're obv town (while the missing player is the one being voted, obviously). So to that end, hopping on a wagon (or being on a wagon) and demanding a claim is much better for scum as they can get a claim and then either stick on it if it's a VT claim, or leave saying they believe the claim if it's a PR, and they've successfully outed said role. So yeah, thanks for making me think about that a bit more.<br>\n<br>\nAlso, in regards to this game, something I can bring up now. I have just recently finished modding Mutiny On The High Seas in mini-themes (check out the intro vid, seriously <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\";)\" title=\"Wink\">), and two of the scum spent almost the entire game at each others throats purely because they started distancing, and didn't reel themselves back in quickly enough, leaving them being forced to argue, and argue, and argue. To the point they had no choice but to vote each other at times, and make sure they were pushing each other ridiculously hard.<br>\n<br>\nI saw that quite clearly in Zyrco and Andrew, which is one of the additional reasons I have such a strong conviction about them being joint scum. It screamed to me of distancing, and then not stopping early enough.<br>\n<br>\nSo yeah, back to andrew for the lynch.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">vote: andrew94</div><br>\n<br>\nI'm also seeing somewhat of a similarity between my previous play in my earlier referenced game with fitz in Nacho (saying that you'll say more, and somehow always avoiding it).

Now if we assume that on each of the mislynches there's at least one scum, it means it's between kiku, broken and myself. Obviously I know it wasn't me, which means it's one of them (It can't be both, as I doubt all three scum would be on the day 1 wagon).<br>\n<br>\nWith Zyrconium's lynch, I expect at least one scum to bus him. We previously deduced it can't be kiku. But I'm not so sure now, I'll get to that shortly.<br>\n<br>\nNacho's lynch has to have one scum on it. The only way that's not possible is if the only scum on 4computer's wagon was Zyrc, and I'm not buying that. I'm not scum, so that leaves us on kiku and broken.<br>\n<br>\nIf we assume kiku is town based on her day 2 vote shift onto Zyrc, that leaves broken. This also means that every single wagon has had zero scum from the halfway point, and the day 2 wagon has either andrew at the start as scum and no scum elsewhere. Or no scum at all. I'm not buying that.<br>\n<br>\nIt would also mean that Zyrc and broken voted 4computer in quick succession, and just prayed town followed up on the lynch. Is anyone buying that? I'm not either. As a note, if I'm scum, it would mean that I either have to be scum with kiku, or 2 (or 3 if you count broken) scum voted at the start of the day phase, and relied on town to see the lynch through.<br>\n<br>\nThis means that the only solid scum we have at this stage is kiku. Based on all the wagons it makes more sense that kiku is scum on them all over anyone else.<br>\n<br>\nI highly doubt kiku and broken are scum together due to the day 1 wagon. If I wasn't in this slot I could see an argument for a kiku/prana team so I'll consent that some might pull that up, but I guess my only argument to that would lead to a WIFOM \"why would I point all this out otherwise?\"<br>\n<br>\nThis leaves our final scum to be between Xtoxm and andrew94.

It would be much easier for him to have either voted me, or done what he's done most of the game, say next to nothing and quickhammer me later on if given a chance.

I believed the Vengeful would try to kill himself as early as possible to avoid being nightkilled.<br>\n<br>\nI strongly believed the Mafia would win until Night 5. When they killed the Cop N1 with a lucky shot I was like \"game over,\" even when the town recovered a little by lynching the Mafia RB D2. However, both sides' play dropped somewhat the next few days and nights (Zyrc was definitely the most active scum player, I must admit), and a lurkerkill followed by a lurker lynch were not the best decisions IMO. Havingfitz was the right kill (and IMO should have been the N2 kill) because he was definitely the most obvtownie player in the game, plus he was the Doctor. PranaDevil was the next-most obvtown player, and I have absolutely no clue why the scum let him live to LyLo. I fully expected Prana to be the N5 kill, and my jaw dropped when it was andrew, who (as I noted in the dead QT several times) was by far the most easily manipulated or easily mislynched player. The only explanation I can think of is that Prana suspected Xtoxm somewhat D5 and Xtoxm was attempting to frame Prana, which was inadvisable considering that Prana and kiku cross-voted in LyLo as he himself noted.<br>\n<br>\nI would like to thank Xtoxm a lot for filling into a slot that was causing me considerable difficulty and playing it both fairly actively and well to the end of the game.
