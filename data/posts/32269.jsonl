Mayor Fegelein had made his most controversial decision yet. The eccentric and paranoid man was worried that with the recent declaration of war on Russia that Russian spies would infiltrate his Town. After a mass stockpile on food, drink and supplies, Mayor Fegelein locked down the Town, denying anybody entry or access to either enter or leave the Town. To many, this may have ruined their lives by denying them the right to visit friends and family, but on the bright side,   at least it would protect them from the Russians, right?<br><br>Yes.<br><br>But not from the Mafia.<br><br>This new act prevented the Mafia from being able to trade with their associates. Trapped in the town like everybody else, the Mafia decided to create an insurgency to unlock the Town. But the only way that was going to happen was with everybody else dead. Starting with Mayor Fegelein.<br><br>*fade to black*<br><br>\"BANGBANGBANGBANGBANG!\". A ferocious volley of bullets could be heard roaring through the Town at 2am in the morning. Everybody in the Town was quick to crowd in the Town square as the carcass of Mayor Fegelein, wrapped in a bodybag was quickly dumped into a coffin and taken to the cemetery to be disposed of. During the early hours, a meeting was called with the townsfolk, and in an incredible 13-0 landslide victory, it was decided that the Townspeople would execute one person per day in order to catch the people responsible for this atrocity. The hunt was on to stop the Insurgent force.<br></span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Fegelein, <span style=\"color: green\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Town Mayor</span></span>, was killed Night 0.</span><br><br><div align=\"center\"><hr style=\"height:14px; width:100%\"></div><br><br>Playerlist:<br>Elyse<br>Albert B.

Again, it's a simple disagreement.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>The first paragraph states that Aphix does not believe Albert's post to be a bad one. He is defending Albert against accusations that his post was bad. The fact that he is defending Albert shows a clear stance that he doesn't believe Albert to be scummy for the reasons provided. Albert is apparently null or town from Aphix's POV at that point. You painting it as a \"lack of taking stances\" reads as scummy to me. You aren't looking for possible town motivations or understanding the underlying implications of his post. So what if he took no explicit stance? He has implied his stance through a defense.<br><br>In the second paragraph, Aphix accuses EPM of hypocrisy but says that it is null. This is another implicit defense of Albert and a null read on Epm.</div></blockquote><br><br>Claiming that I'm \"not looking for town motivations\" is silly - I'm not going to explain my in-depth thought process in constructing every single post. Additionally, while I agree that he is defending ABR, he refuses to claim that ABR is a townread, using such cop-outs as \"isn't necessarily a bad post.\" When he says that ABR's post \"isn't necessarily a bad post,\" we get two possibilities - either ABR is a nullread, in which case this post from aphix is doing exactly what I said it was doing (talking a whole lot about someone without taking a stance, which is scummy - townies are typically concerned with people that they have reads on, or with forming reads on those who they don't have reads on). Or, ABR is a townread, in which case, why not out-and-out say that ABR is a townread instead of using that phrasing? <br><br>In essence, he is showing that he doesn't believe ABR to be scummy for the reasons provided... yet. He doesn't preclude the possibility that what ABR has done *IS* scummy by saying that it's \"not necessarily\" scummy, and he fails to take any stance on ABR himself, nor does he take a stance on anyone else. <br><br>Him giving implicit defense of ABR is scummy on its own, in my opinion. I find explicitness to be a towntell and implicitness to be a scumtell - townies are more willing to simply speak their minds, whereas scum want to leave their options open. His giving a null read on EPM is also scummy after he's been talking about EPM.</div></div></div><br><br>EPM: Answer Fusion's actual question.

Notable exceptions: if we popcorn at lylo then yeah, claim before L-2 (also, don\u2019t vote in mylo/lylo until we come to an agreement).

Obviously khan is also a mind reading wizard.<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: kublai khan</span>To make it official.</div></blockquote><br>In both these posts he is just being silly and throwing around made-up reasons for his votes. Nothing about them struck me as coming from a desire to fit in. Please link me to those other examples where you did this as town. <br><br>Aphix's nullread on Albert isn't scummy. Other people were reading Albert as scum. He took a stance to say that he disagrees with them. He doesn't rule out the possibility of Albert being scum because he has no way of knowing that this early. Albert may as well be scum but the reasoning provided for that is inadequate. Aphix points it out and takes a position on it. The fact that he has no read on Albert is irrelevant. There is no reason he should be expected to have one so early in the game.<br><br>Implosion, I don't like how you are passing off our argument as a \"disagreement\" and emphasizing that it doesn't make you scummy as opposed to convincing me that Aphix is. Your priority seems to be to get me to back off of you regardless of whether or not I agree with you on Aphix. As town, shouldn't you be persuading me to vote your scumread as opposed to saying that we disagree and that I shouldn't scumread you for that?</div></blockquote><br>My position is a bit subtle. I'm not arguing that a nullread on ABR is scummy in and of itself; I'm arguing that his active posturing over ABR without coming to a conclusion, combined with how he phrased his arguments, is scummy. And again, it's not a very strong read. <br><br>If my scumread on aphix was stronger then yes, by all means, I would be putting some energy into convincing you of my scumread, but I'm not going to do that unless I'm confident in it. The great thing about early game is that I can put out whatever arguments I can find, and see others critique them without any time pressure or any pressure from interactions that have formed. That's exactly what's happening. I'm also a very defensive player in nature; if there are arguments against me, my first priority is typically to refute them. <br><br>It'll probably take me a bit to find a game that's an example of the overjustification thing so I'll get back to you on that in a little."}

This kind of lame generalization in response to an attack can be done for any case.  I'm not claiming that \"X action\" is always a scumtell.  I'm saying that his filler post (you don't agree it is) made me wary of him and it seems is part of what made implosion wary as well.  The whole 2 voting thing is also rather unnecessary but I didn't give it as much importance as implosion did.  <br><br>If you want to argue theory.  Be prepared for people to have different opinions.  What you claim is relative.  Your evidence for it is probably anecdotal and based on the fact that there are simply more town players than scum players, therefore, everything can easily be associated as \"well, town does X more than scum, even\". <br><br>Everything is more likely to come from town than from scum!! <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Everything</span>!<br><br>There's something that I like to call \"mild scum\" where scum tries to appear active but not go too hard against anyone if they don't feel safe doing so.

I brought that up as an example because in my previous game iV was absolutely convinced that bae was town because of being too n00b to be scum. I was not saying that aphix was definitely scum but was trying to get pacman to consider his stance that aphix wagon is supposedly on a VI (who doesn\u2019t act like a VI at all). It addresses one possible scenario. We also won because D3 was basically a lurkfest resulting in a no lynch which isn\u2019t a risk today but it doesn\u2019t hurt to call people on it early.

Giving a list of options, claiming all of those options are unlikely/impossible, and therefore claiming that all options are unlikely/impossible when the list of options was not actually exhaustive.</div></div></div><br><br>I have townreads on Fusion, evilpacman, and Elyse. Which is sad given that all 3 of them are scumreading me. Fusion I already explained, evilpacman's original aggression towards ABR looked genuine and his continued push has also looked genuine. Elyse is honestly originally based on reading <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5399301#p5399301\">100</a> as genuine, which is probably bad since it's the kind of thing that can be genuine even from scum, but meh. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5402596#p5402596\">138</a> feels like a weak question, though, but i can see it being asked by town. I guess i'd classify elyse as a weak townread right now relative to fusion and epm (fusion is a tad stronger than epm i'd say).<br><br>In terms of aphix, looking bad at <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5396787#p5396787\">74</a> I think the thing that set off my paranoia that my scumread was bad is the last paragraph, but on reread it's meh. That whole post just doesn't make me feel a lot. The last paragraph (in response to me) gives me a bit of pause on my scumread, and I'm not sure why. Gut I suppose. But I'm going to ignore that. <br><br>aphix in general seems to have a fair amount of concern over the quality of discussion that takes place. This could either be because aphix really is interested in the quality of discussion that takes place, or that focusing on telling people to say more useful things is a good substitute for him giving reads. Idk, I think I'm ranting a bit at this point. I think I still lean scum on aphix.<br><br>Attempting to get a read on KK: on reread, I find the original fos on fusion mildly scummy (it feels a bit fabricated). The whole way that KK is going about attacking Fusion honestly feels a bit fabricated too... like the line \"The fact that Fusion read your horrible case and called it legit is the real scum-tell in all this. Chances are both you and Albert B. Rampage are town.\" That line feels like an indirect attempt to get ABR and EPM on his side... and it feels like it was done in a non-genuine way. It's difficult to quantify. The first response in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5396714#p5396714\">70</a> also feels a bit off - while it does answer Fusion's question, it leaves some to be desired. Specifically, why is epm's making the case being written off as bad play, whereas Fusion's accepting that case has to be scum play and not just bad play? I think this is kind of why the scumread on Fusion feels contrived - I feel like the justifications for fossing Fusion over other people feel like they were contrived so that KK could fos who he wanted to fos for some other purposes (i.e., scum motivation). So I'd lean scum on him atm.<br><br>Gonna cut this post off here and do more in another post."}

Post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5394883#p5394883\">36</a> rips on fusion, all but calling him scum. Says EPM is scum. Votes me. Explains his vote 45 posts later. Mentions lots of scum pairs/trios despite saying it's a bold thing to say so early. Feels like he is reaching EVERYWHERE while accomplishing nothing.<br>Elyse: Seems interested in voicing an opinion, have no problem with content. Still keeping a null read, as seems to be all huggy with a variety of people. <br>HP: town read. Would like to see more activity. <br><br>Welp, above posts involved digging through ISO. Probably still haven't made enough decisions or solid enough reads but hopefully that'll help, did provide me with a new comfortable place for my vote.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: gorckat</span>"}

Just let others direct the flow. Not do Anything until you have strong reads? What happens if there are several of this play style in the game? Even with weak reads can you not still make comments or ask clarifying questions? I'm pretty sure we want you to participate. And most importantly of course we want you to be honest why would you even ask that? Your post reads as your asking hp what to do. Play the game. Participate. Scum hunt. Something honestly."}

Looking at it in ISO realize the confusion, but I trying to correct my @implosion comment. The rest of your 2-4 reply ... well I'd say I could just copy paste your response here as well.<br><br>Post 74 was a comment regarding the argument over Albert's first post. Post 124, fifty posts later, is about the discussion generated over my second vote ... So how is there an inconsistency between me liking one discussion and disliking a different unrelated discussion?<br><br>In response to the gorckat, you can have null reads of that ... But if we all thought the same it wouldn't be the same game. I don't need the internet to play with myself. I still find it odd to say, this guy is scum. This guy is scum, but I'm going to vote a person I'm not talking about, later on explain it as \"a vibe\" which is worse then a scum-dance and worse then fusion just being scum no matter what? <br><br>My move off albert, does come because I don't think a vote there is going to help the game at this point. You moving off the wagon is part of the reason for that, but certainly isn't THE reason. In regards to 164, so now trying to learn the reasons someone is playing how they are in a current game is unrelated to the game? I'm pretty sure motives has something to do with the game or at least has something to do with how I play.<br><br>I did start liking EPMs post. \"lean town\" is an indicated it wasn't a strong feeling. Then up through 124 he had a lot imo empty posts. He looks like he's attempting to be busy. A \"concern\" but notice not really any mention of thinking him scum, or any specific scum tells I call out? So, leaning positive, some things I don't like, leaning back. End up back towards the middle. <br><br>Now we go back to 74 and 124. Answered above. Still not talking about the same things here.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>AzBlueM wrote:</cite>Just to be clear, 74 refers to your response to kk in 51?</div></blockquote><br><br>Don't understand the question. Explain?<br><br>I read you town, because I like your posts. Up until 172 where I feel like you ISOd me and decided not to ignore context, I understand your reasoning behind items. I feel you are mostly trying to get clarification on things. Postings your opinions which feel genuine.<br><br>@elyse: You went from abrasive to friendly. It's a strange change that in my opinion merits question, and it's not really just one person it's a change in style of post."}

The post is half fluff, half positioning, and no town feels the need to come in and show off their good intentions before anyone's even posted.</div></blockquote><br><br>The issue I had with this post is two-fold:<br>Paragraph 1 - Answers (incorrectly) for another player<br>Paragraph 2 - Overblown and inaccurate charges against Albert B.

His tone of attacking Albert felt genuine. His post was pro-active and aggressive in a very natural way. It looked like he was hunting for scum. That gave me an early townread.</div></blockquote><br><br>I'll give you an insight.. On day 1, I'm not looking for bad/forced cases from scum. Scum don't do that on Day 1 because it's usually way too obvious and scum try to be more careful. Scum are much more likely to support bad cases in a sideways manner in order to either help push them along or to gain a favorable relationship with the townie making the bad case.<br><br>I'm reading evilpacman18 as town right now because you look like scum sucking up to him, not because of any of his actions. You're explanation as to why you got an early townread on evilpacman18 is because of tone. Which is a pretty vague and easily bullshitted reason for a townread. I also read post 29 as faint backing. <br><br>In post 83, I asked you to explain further:<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5398148#p5398148\" class=\"postlink\">post 83</a>, Kublai Khan wrote:</cite>Also, how did evilpacman19 look like he was hunting for scum?

How is that hunting?</div></blockquote><br>And you ignored these questions.<br><br>In post 73, you also asked \"What is the scum motivation in attacking a strong player right out the gate with a dubious case?\" This may have been a valid reason to get a townread on evilpacman18, so I asked you to provide some sort of evidence that you knew Albert B. Rampage was a strong player. But despite my making it perfectly clear that I wanted <span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"font-style: italic\">your</span></span> opinion on Albert B. Rampage, you just pointed out my thoughts on the matter, which continue to be irrelevent. Since you won't, or can't, provide evidence that you knew Albert B. Rampage to be a strong player, then that reason is bunk as well.<br><br>So. You're scum.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">vote: Fusion</span>"}

You're now just trying to see how many things you can nitpick and paint them as scummy (which makes me very confident of my vote).  How is the number of the page relevant at all?

It's an attack that's impossible to defend against.  I make cases with justification, of course I do.  Because I intend to lynch the people I pursue because I think they're scum (Which is why I hesitate to get into the RVS process not to lose the power of my vote).

I call them as I see them.  If I think I misrepresented someone or that my BS or fallacy call was unwarranted.  I'll happily retract it.

You had done NOTHING and provided no reads because you claimed to have none (except the implosion vote which at the time, didn't seem very strong, did it?).

Even more so, on one hand you're pretending that you caught me and you're sure that I'm scum and in the other you're saying \"we can't scumhunt\".<br><br>By now, I know you won't answer any of this except to keep with emotional bullshit and fabricated mini-points but I'll ask simple questions just in case:<br><br>1) Everything from your last couple of posts seems to indicate you're absolutely sure that I'm scum, correct? <br><br>2) What about implosion, has your read changed in any way?<br><br>3) Do you think any of the points you made against me apply to another player? <br><br>4) Are there examples of the opposite of what you accuse me of from other players?<br><br>I'll stop there even though there are so many things that I'd love to ask you if you cared to respond because your \"thought process\" is so shaky that it's absolutely tempting to try to get as much as possible out there so that everyone can see for themselves how faulty your logic is and how much pain you're going through trying to make up reasons for this OMGUS vote."}

Nice.</div></blockquote><br><br>Firstly, huge misrep quoted above.<br><br>Secondly, Poirot does a whole lot of complaining about other players referencing me as a strong player or defending my play on meta. He goes on at great length throughout the day about this, such as in <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5398640#p5398640\" class=\"postlink\">post 94</a>, <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5399211#p5399211\" class=\"postlink\">post 98</a>.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5407172#p5407172\" class=\"postlink\">post 159</a>, Humble Poirot wrote:</cite>Tl;Dr: On the verge of voting ABR but awaiting some responses.</div></blockquote><br><br>Thirdly, he uses a cheap trick, quoted above, to add the illusion of credibility to his future vote. Why would a townie try to setup a future vote, on page 7? The norm is starting the day with firing random votes in every direction and using any excuse imaginable to get the game moving. What in the world is up with this guy being on the verge of voting someone...? Let me tell you. He A) feels the need to justify his vote and B) is planning his strategy in advance. <br><br>Of course, it looks bad if I can't answer his questions, because they are too sharp and I have nowhere to turn to, to defend myself. <br><br>Unless...<br><br>Unless, he doesn't actually have a question, he just wants to provoke me and proceed to push the strategy he pre-planned in his head.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Humble Poirot wrote:</cite>Do you have no reads? If so, why did you make that bs up about implosion?</div></blockquote><br><br>Is that actually a legitimate question he expects me to answer? I disagree that \"I made up bs about implosion\". I think there was a disconnect in what implosion said. Poirot may think it was a stretch, but the setup of his questioning and the subsequent vote is scummy.<br><br>He demonstrates a lack of genuine interest in obtaining information; if he did care, he would ask neutral, objective questions that allow the person to present their thoughts in a different way. <br><br>Instead, he resorts to asking bait questions, and follows it up with apparent dismay at my uncooperativeness for not responding to him.<br><br>Twice, he claims that it's a hard game. It's not a hard game. The reason we haven't been doing anything, and I want to put emphasis on this, is because bandwagons are not being pushed. We can hardly get to half a wagon for a lynch on any one player. Do you think we can scumhunt in these circumstances? Town will not compromise on their reads, scum will not wagon-hop, and we're wasting the day away. Change that with me now. Let Poirot hang.</div></blockquote><br>I actually really like this post and agree with it mostly.<br><br>But HP came up with some good responses and you just ignore him? Wtf is that?<br><br>@HP<br>Fusion is a strong townread for having similar thought processes to my own, gut, being willing to (and changing) reads as new information comes in, and for things mentioned before.<br><br>As far as ABR being a strong townread, that's gone. I don't have scum meta from him but yeah I don't like how he's just ignoring you (especially since his case was decent).

Sorry I haven't been more active. Weekend was tough and busy with work. Things that are showing up that I'd like to put my opinion in.<br><br>@Fusion: Post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5424492#p5424492\">258</a> concerns me. So you are on the HP side of the debate? Now I agree with HP on most of his points and his views in this. But what specifically do you agree with? Is it just what HP is saying? Is there something ABR is doing that you don't like? More then choosing sides would be nice. Lets hear your views on this then throwing your support in with HP, where later on you can say, well, HP was wrong, he fooled me. I just don't think choosing sides is good psychologically for the game either.<br><br>My views: I'm currently very concerned with ABR saying he's ignoring HP and brushing of the whole thing. The whole, HP is mean I'm not playing with him doesn't really benefit anyone. ABR we all know there is more going on then you and HP arguing. That doesn't mean you can just dismiss the whole thing. It's also a concern his activity level/content level has changed due to HPs claims. I agree that ABR is responding with appeal to emotion, and then distancing himself from the discussion. I don't think we should let it cool off and him slip away. I'm not sold on a lynch at this point, but we need some sort of discussion point or we just stagnant. ABR seems to be knee jerk voting at this point. Not a big fan of that either.<br><br>EspeciallyTheLies entrance isn't a concern for me as it seems to be. I certainly look forward to hearing her views on the game. Nothing to change the read on this slot yet.<br><br>@Skelda: What are your view points on this game? I'd like to see some more reads out of you. Certainly would want more then the reasoning on your last vote to sell me on anything. IMO we has humans see something we don't understand as different. Which might explain his vote more aversion to misunderstanding then some sort of scum motivation. <br><br>@Elyse: Why are you so sold the AzBlueM//EspeciallyTheLies is a scum slot? Care to post your current case?<br><br>@Everyone: I know everyone doesn't like doing reads, but current view points on the game? Anything? Seems like even some of the votes have been sat on for some time.<br><br>Definitely curious where Ant_to_the_max, gorckat, havingfitz and skelda are currently. Seems like we are well into the game and I know post count isn't everything but always dislike having a huge discrepancy. <br><br>At this time not much has changed in my reads. HP right now is still strong town read. More recent posts continue supporting it. Fusion aside from the dislike I mentioned above still read town, and even that post goes along with what I've read from his posts that may not be great posts, or great plays or a strong player but still comfortable with read there.<br><br>Do still want to get some ISOs for personal reference even if I'm not doing a full public breakdown anywhere. I do keep active from my phone and can make short replies there but long time reading and large posts I save when I can get some laptop time."}

He made a post against Albert with mostly legitimate concerns. I agree that Albert's vote on implosion is BS. I asked him how sure he was about his implosion vote. He never bothered to respond. HP's concern here is a very valid one - one that I had as well (Albert's implosion vote). Further the fact that Albert doesn't push implosion is deeply concerning and against what he says in his guide. I wanted to ask about this as well but I first wanted to make sure that Albert indeed had a strong scumread on implosion.<br><br>2) Alberts realizes that HP is serious about his vote. He knows that persuing implosion while a player like HP attacks him will be very difficult.<br><br>3) Albert decides that the best way to deal with HP is a head-on collision and OMGUSes HP. <br><br>4) Albert says that HP wants to \"provoke him\" and \"asks bait questions.\" While I agree that HP's style is unique and is rather aggressive and contains leading questions, a quick look through at HP's town-meta shows that it fits his town style to a T. Albert hasn't done this research or attempted to figure out HP's affiliation. He is using baseless accusations that look good on the surface to attack HP.<br><br>5) As HP gets more aggressive towards Albert, Albert attempts to frustrate him further attempting to make him look bad by refusing to read his posts, answer his question and push more junk suspicion on him saying things like \"<span style=\"font-style: italic\">I will engage with you when you calm your tone down and post something readable</span>.\""}

I don't see a problem with preemptively defending people against attacks that I believe to be fallacious or incorrect. The point of mafia is not for everyone to defend themselves, on their own, against everything that comes against them. It's for everyone to collectively determine everyone's alignment; I believe that discussion about peoples' reads is beneficial to that end."}

This is the kind of thing I talk about of <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">people trying not to take responsibility</span>.  If ABR is an easy mislynch, I'm a fairy godmother.  People all around seem to want to call him town for the weirdest things  This excuse scummy meta thing in MS needs to stop, last time I was voting  saki and people called her town for \"retracting her fake PGO claim\".  She only got lynched because cop inspected her and was replaced by another player, also scummy but more active.  Inactivity is a great defense.  If you post less, there's less things people can attack you with and you can leave your options open.  <br><br>Furthermore, you call it a mislynch on a competent player's faults when he has shown no competency whatsoever during the course of this game.  How can you call him scummy and silly and lacking town motivation but also saying \"a competent player's faults\".<br><br>Btw, you're voting a similarly sized wagon atm.  What would you say if ETL was lynched, flipped town and someone told you \"squeezed out a mislynch on a competent player's faults\"?"}

When I stopped responding to him, you can see a noticeable reduction in his activity level. It is convenient to tunnel as scum. In fact, I tend to find it extremely easy to tunnel. You antagonize the least amount of people, you don't have to explain a change in your reads, and you can always stay constant and look consistent. While town can and do tunnel, it looks very different. There will be moments of uncertainty, changes in reads, paranoia of other players, and sometimes entire reversals of reads. KK's tunneling has none of those attributes because he is not trying to determine affiliations. He is taking a position that is consistent and defending it, in order to give the illusion that he is producing content."}

(the alternative could be Elyse for skelda).<br><br>- The thing we have to look is the same thing as always.  Considering ABR flipped town and I think ETL is town as well, it means the only two \"likely\" wagons were on townspeople.  So we should see who had no problems with things either way and who were passionate about their lynches.  The ones who didn't care that much are more likely to be town, since they can just coast and avoid responsibility.<br><br>- Elyse is a damn enigma.  His actions are absolutely surprising.  So damaging and yet, he still finds a way to make you second guess that he might just be town, even after making one awful choice after the other.<br>- As I pointed out in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5436682#p5436682\">526</a>.  Could Elyse REALLY think that ABR or her would be killed over a claimed jailkeeper?  You have to be really bad to think that way.<br>- Elyse's intervention in ABR's lie outted 2 PRs.  One is dead because of it and the other will likely die tonight.<br>- Why was Elyse so keen to know if EPM had inspected her?<br>- Elyse's vote on me d2 straight off the bat is awful.  One of those \"Oh, town player who died said lynch X, first post of the day, let's not aknowledge anything, just lynch X\".<br>- Elyse's reasoning is beyond terrible and it has been demonstrated with the two PR reveals.  That said, he can be a terribly bad town player.<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5444375#p5444375\" class=\"postlink\">post 600</a>, Elyse wrote:</cite>I thought it would help us because I didn't think ABR would be lying about his claim.

I still want to know your reasons for calling me scum.  You said I was defscum at the end of d1 (When I wasn't there). <br><br>- The fact that EPM has a result means that scum don't have a RB role.  Which is quite interesting.<br>- The fact that there's a gunsmith, means that there could easily be an sk who shot JK or was jailkept.  Or a vig.<br><br>- gorckat reads town through the whole interaction with Elyse.  <br><br>- The fact that ABR claimed Fusion was part of the scumteam (OMGUS) despite Fusion having claimed JK even when he didn't need to (which made him obvious town) already speaks volumes about his pathetic excuse of a guess.  The fact that I'm reading gorckat as town and that the other player is me seems to lay the groundwork for an extremely funny post-game where I hope ABR gets all the mocking he deserves.<br><br>he can't even get ONE guy right from a reduced pool (EPM and fusion were obvtown).<br><br>- ETL is still likely town due to his willingness to get lynched yesterday.<br>- implosion still reads town.<br>- ETL's point in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5437448#p5437448\">583</a> about skelda's rehearsed point seems accurate.  <br>- havingfitz whole interaction voting me and then unvoting looks awful.  Pure opportunism.<br>- the ant inspection is excellent.  considering the low activity and the fact that it means he is likely town (Which is better than a scum find, considering the circumstances).<br>- If anyone has cracked the game open.  It's EPM, I think he is spot on about havingfitz in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5445073#p5445073\">616</a> (I signalled his convinient change of stance towards me when he switched to \"To be determined\".<br>- I still feel the same way about aphix too.

Remember when you doubted how suicidal she could be? but then you were kinda swayed?  She has demonstrated to be absolutely reckless.  There's a possibility that she might have, knowing that ABR was town and liked her, tried to come to his aid.  Although, as I write this, I have quite a hard time believing that would be the case (which is why, despite all my doubts and wanting to know more, I don't put her in the actual guess).  Trying to help/manipulate ABR as scum, seems to come from a much smarter type of play than Elyse is displaying.</fieldset><br><fieldset style=\"border:3px outset grey; padding:5px 10px\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">@EPM</span><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5445180#p5445180\" class=\"postlink\">post 618</a>, evilpacman18 wrote:</cite>There's probably a traitor</div></blockquote>mafia that doesn't know their scumteam?

It did catch the scummiest player who should've been lynched.  I've been catching scum lately or at least, removing a very anti-town player (who lies as town) from the game.  This has happened in my last recent games.  I've also been quite favorably impressed by my record of late.  I don't write novels because I want to show off, when I write them, it's because I feel there's something worth pointing out.  If there's relevant info out there, it must be placed for scrutiny.

Hopefully you can understand this without any fancy formatting or quoting. <br><br>First, a question for every one... how many people keep track of who has atownread on them with this many players left inn the game?  I personally don't, but I want to do a quick survey before i conclude that its a scummy thing. Scumreads I can understand,  but townreads feels like a \"who do i have in my back pocket\" mentality. <br><br>Okay, speaking of mentality,  this is my main concern with humble poirot and the mafia mason thing. Mafia mason is not just an anachronistic role, it's a bastard role and therefore impossible. So i feel the only real reason to bring it up is if he believed that Albert b. Rampage <br>might be a mason, but wanted to discredit him amongst other mason members. If elyse is claiming mason with a huge scumread, why not suspect elyse at any point? reading it felt like humble poirot was stretching to keep elyse and Albert at opposite ends of the reads spectrum and i can't figure out a  towny reason to.  Why three lack of paranoia towards elyse?<br><br>The 4) answer isn't fluff.  It's a false flag.  Humble Poirot isn't refuting my case in good faith, he's scrambling to attack everything I'm doing as scummy in an attempt to\"win\" this exchange.  It's massively defensive behavior which i admit that both scum and town do, but the difference is that town generally post a care then tunnel.  Scum Errol just tunnel, forgetting that just posting suspicion isn't enough to justify their behavior. <br><br>And havingfitz isn't attacking evilpacman18 as a defense to the case against him. That makes no sense.  Epm didn't investigate his,  so it's moot. He is either ignorant of perfectly acceptable investigation strategy (if he had day talk scum mates, they would correct him) or he's paranoid s fuck  (a town tell, duh).<br><br>There's probably more to  say, but i have to work now and I'm tired of fighting this cdamn autocorrect."}

You supposed scumreads simply come from \"X should be doing Y and isn't, he's scum!\" arguments instead of trying to analyze motives.  <br>- <br>2) You've explicitly avoided addressing our EPM and my arguments about the merits of the strategy (lynch scummy claimed mason A and WCS confirm the other and have him possibly be protected - all before Fusion/EPM's claims <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5436121#p5436121\">437</a>).<br>3) I see you somehow don't mention ETL at all in your scumteam.

Posts like 726 are fantastic and super pro-town. But the end of Day 1 troubles me. The situation is that there is a deadline approaching, a wagon leader, and a sudden and corroborated mason claim. EspeciallyTheLies, implosion, Fusion, and evilpacman18 all had town gut reactions. A sort of careful, calculating \"how can we best use this situation to town's advantage\". Your thought process when posting/thinking quickly is alien to me. Mafia Masons is an obscure/baffling theory to thought out there. Because I can't understand your thought process from a towny point of view, I don't trust you.

At least two people (evilpacman18 and Skelda) seem to only be voting for me because I disagree with them.

He had OMGUSed me and then completely dropped it, voted Fusion without explanation and then ETL because \"he could only post to vote before deadline\".  Pretending he actually thought I was scum was quite a stretch.  His long post on me was BS and the rebuttal is there for people to see.  He never replied to that because \"I hurt his feelings\" and later proceeded to ignore me until that vote out of nowhere.  It looked like he just wanted to save himself by eliminating those who called for his lynch (me, fusion) and that was actually true. <br>Furthermore, after being conviniently inactive, he tries to get ME quicklynched without explanations and with half a claim when barely anyone had shown willingness to vote me and there was 1 day left to deadline.  <br><br>I can't believe you don't understand the logic of a compromise lynch in deadline.

So this in my concern with havingfitz. I feel his vote and opinions have been all over the place. Changing is certainly going to a thing, but I don't feel it changes naturally.

He seems to switch votes to who votes him. He keeps throwing suspicion on EPM. Which I obviously don't much like his claim or his investigation, but either its true and we find out soon enough or he doesn't get killed soon and we know, which you seem to agree with so why keep bringing it up and arguing about it, aside to make noise. I feel like he's going with the most convenient wagon at the time and don't think he's strongly backing any specific,  throwing around items to see if they stick. I'm concerned where all his reads come from and where they go. Maybe he's just too advanced of a player for me. But I don't follow his reasoning. <br><br>As for the Skelda bit, not sure if I see a lot of alignment indicative tells, just a lot of horrible player tells. So I'm not sure where to go with that.<br><br>Still comfortable with my HP townread. Still dislike KK, predominately on 730, but it could certainly read as just frustration with the game as he mentions. Gorckat calls everyone else for not agreeing with him. And drunk votes me, because of my vote, others response to my vote is pretty natural. Gorckat takes it far, 'because of what we know.' Like he thinks I'm trying to start a wagon there, instead of discussion. Then he disappears again, null to scum there, similar to D1. Still upset that ant has responded any where. Still not much pinging on ETL, I think it's confusing that people this he's scum d1, he even calls himself out on lurking d2 and no one is concerned there. Seems strange as well. implosion I'm starting to read town on, elyse is a big bucket of I don't know whats going on and I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one. epm I've stated my opinions above, it's a waiting game but not a fan of his plays so far today."}

We have enough appeals to emotion as it is (from havingfitz and his continued talk of him being a mislynch).<br><br>KK, what's going on? You're not reading.  aphix said very clearly why he was voting HF, so did implosion.  and EPM did it long ago.  Skelda said it recently and I've said over the span of several pages.  Asking us to restate our cases is just a vague way to nitpick a summary to make it look weak or be able to do what you're doing in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5464418#p5464418\">777</a> and say: \"Oh, no one is saying anything!  No one has a case on havingfitz!\".  If you were really honest about this, you'd make an effort and read what the people on havingfitz's waggon have said.<br><br>I'll humor you though, since my case is the most scattered:<br><br>Case on havingfitz (bulletpoints):<br>- first sign of warning.  Change of stance towards me without saying why (TBD).<br>- Vote on me to quicklynch near deadline following ABR's incomplete claim.   (gets fosed).  Opportunistic.<br>- POE<br>- didn't care that much.<br>- Tarnish on EPM using horrible logic (He didn't do what I'd do, therefore scum).  Ignores the unlikelyhood of scum to claim what and when EPM did (twists the truth to do this - obtown ant - oneshot).<br>- Lack of consistency towards ETL (forgot about him until asked)<br>- \"reporting\" to fill a post with \"activity\" (probably to counter my activity or length of post that some might see as town).<br><br>Now I'll ask you to do the same for Skelda, KK.  Go ahead and force the people on Skelda's wagon to restate their case.  Come on!  If they don't, act outraged.<br><br>- @havingfitz: I lynched town.  You lynched no one and didn't even vote the person you \"supposedly\" suspected (ETL). <br>- I try to get results but sometimes I'm wrong.  You're not trying, you're just trying to blame others and let OTHERS get lynched.  <br>- You need to claim.  You're L-1 but you are not doing so for some reason.  <br><br>@Elyse:  Well, you and others like HF are keen to blame me on the mislynch of ABR so I remind you that you likely have no grounds on it.  And I show my intent and eagerness to lynch scum and pressure who I think is lying. <br><br>It's funny how little conviction the people on my wagon had that they rapidly switched to Skelda.  Despite the strong words, you can see that they just want me off their backs.<br><br>ETL's comment is stupid.  People might've thought I was an easy lynch after ABR called me scum (HF followed, Elyse called me scum) and  he flipped town.  Come d1, Elyse insta votes and after I call them scum, HF and KK hop on my wagon.   They might've thought they could get me but, when I fought it out and pursued them, they retreated to the easier Skelda wagon (which might very well be scum as well - see my guess) <br><br>I don't like gorckat of late.  At all.  I know he's been busy but he came back and said \"nothing has happened\" when votes on two wagons close to lynches were made and he is the only one not voting in one of them (ant is MIA).  And previous to that we have the \"drunk\" post.<br><br>Ok, no time.  See you tomorrow (late)."}

Or if you want to hide behind buzzwords, can you at least use them correctly?<br><br>Let's break down the massive amount of stuff wrong here.<br>1) Putting words in quotations is a logical fallacy in itself. It's an appeal to motive. You are trying to get people to question my motives merely by presenting them as questionable. You've brought forth no corresponding evidence to back up your charge that I'm not actually frustrated.<br>2) Appeal to emotion is a broad category of logical fallacies.  And they are fallacies because they are attempting to sway people by inducing an emotional response in the listener. By reading my rant, did I intimidate you into agreeing with me? Did I make you pity me? Even if you can't pin-point the exact emotion I'm attempting to play on, can you at least show a logical endpoint to my accused manipulation? <br>3) By listing me as being emotional, you are conducting an ad hominem fallacy (specifically poisoning the well). You are attacking character instead of argument. In fact you haven't addressed the actual argument at any time, you've just characterized it as emotional (actually, going an additional step and falsely claiming it's fallacious) and therefore not worthy of consideration. <br>4) You're also committing a hasty generalization fallacy. Mafia is a game of individuals. Individuals do not automatically become more logical when they get a town role and conversely scum do not become less logical. I get the general idea that scum have to twist logic to make innocent players look guilty, but over-zealous town players commit the same logical fallacies all the time over and over. Seeing a player commit a logical fallacy is not a scumtell, please stop describing it as such. I'll grant that it's not a towntell. But lack of good does not mean bad (aka affirming the consequent fallacy)<br>5) Not the mention the constant tunneling you're doing. Or, more formally, assuming the conclusion. Anything can be used as evidence that someone is scum if you already believe that they are scum. <br><br>So stop with your whole \"logical fallacy = scum\" rationalizing. Everyone commits multiple logical fallacies constantly. So if you are town, then you're never going to be accurately scum-hunting as you are only targeting the player and not the role. Scum will love you because they can easily manipulate you. <br><br>Despite all the fallacies you've committed, I'm starting to come around that you might be town.

You didn't realize regardless of who voted first, I started the wagon with <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5471320#p5471320\">830</a>? Where I tested the waters. That lead to the KK vote and the subsequent post where implosion says, he'll consider that. If you notice implosion later on see's there is no steam in that wagon and changes his mind quite quickly. Titus makes the quick town points in immediately deciding to call out some quick scum team based on my vote, in defense there he does have a natural response although concerned on the misreading of vote count.

HF <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5472382#p5472382\">841</a> that seems slightly OMGUS. The subsequent KK jump back on Skelda, which seems to me he's willing to toss his vote where ever. You accuse KK of removing pressure from havingfitz. I'm the only one that voted away from havingfitz, and I'm the one that brought up voting gorckat. A lot of this tells me, that you need to step back from this game and rethink it a little. You've been loud and you've been focused and I don't think you are paying attention to the game and I feel you might be a tad bit overconfident, which might be where some of the anti-hp and his smugness come in.<br><br>@Titus: Yeap. I've posted about as many questions as I have posts. Try explaining me trying to engage other players and get more information and try to help form an actual viewpoint on what they are saying is a scum play. Maybe a little more explanation or thoughts there were nice? Considering you come in and claim scum on the gunsmith claim? Don't care to bring up the gunsmith claim. Explain why you think it is a fake claim or anything? I personally am not sold on the gunsmith claim, and your replace in and scum read of the guy who says you don't have a gun isn't helping that much. Or your slot.<br><br>@RachMarie: Did you read? I posted my reasoning on Gorckat. I've even referenced it previously. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5458852#p5458852\">759</a>. So far it seems like your competent on reading a bunch of people as town. After a read through, do you have scum reads? You still haven't placed a vote. Seems like you are more interested in prodding about a bit before staking a claim. Certainly glad you aren't blasting in here with rash plays but feels like you got caught up on reading, although might not have been close, and are playing it too cautious. Although I have come to see replace ins tend to unvote or at least acknowledge their 'pred's vote. Find lack thereof curious as well."}

I thought interacting with me would involve more interesting stuff than \"MD\" but sure.  I don't know if I have a method but basically, I try to look at motives for why people do what they do and probe many people to see how they respond and if it makes sense from their POV.  So nothing is inherently scummy or townie but needs to be analyzed by context.  <br><br>I could also answer something that I didn't bother earlier.  Yes, I know the Socratic method.  It's hard to ensure continued replies in mafia and not lose track but I guess you could say I apply it unintentionally sometimes (Like the whole KK interaction where I show how he clearly lied - I'm now trying to see if he lied as scum or town because his attitude has left me with doubts.  Anyway, I'm kinda pushing that hard analysis off, from now.  Since I don't think he should be lynched right now).<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">@KK:</span> I did discuss my case but the truth is that asking for a concise summary and then taking the short phrases out of context to attack each one individually as if they stood on their own is disingenuous.  Cases are a whole.  Most reasons of a case, on their own, are not enough.<br><br>I'm aware about the context surrounding his L-1 which is why I wanted him to actually feel pressure and was incredibly paranoid about people who seemed to be manufacturing a way for him to \"weasel off\".  <br><br>Mostly maintaining my reads even though they're not in any way stronger.<br>ETL town because I think he was actually willing to get lynched (unlike havingfitz who I think was lying and it's quite suggestive how he proposed a plan when he was not at risk, as you say, and later backed out when I accepted).  I haven't liked his mildness today but he also seems consistent about Skelda so it might be playstyle. <br>implosion:  Still town as well.  I dislike how overly cautious he is but again, that seems to be his playstyle.  He or aphix (whom I have a town read as well) could perfectly be scum but this is not a point where I need to go back and make sure I'm using confirmation bias towards my town reads since there's a different focus I feel is necessary today.  On havingfitz, you (KK), Skelda and gorckat.  It's good that we have a replacement for ant too.<br><br>I said I was going to take a back seat in activity and pushing.  Not that my brain would disappear and I would unvote who I definitely think is scum.  It's not like I haven't made my case."}

See the hallmark of town is that there's sort of this line towards understanding that's really not that hard to follow, and town can be observed struggling up the path to understanding. Mafia already have that knowledge and so there's no climb in their game. That climb is replaced with the self-preservation that is sooooo obvious in EVERYTHING HF POSTS. He's struggling to stay alive, stuff like 784 where he appeals to anyone that would fall for this sort of thing with the I'll lynch myself if you vote HP tomorrow shit and then in the next post decides he changed his mind? It's flailing. Point by point takedowns of everything HP posts about him and reversing as much of it as possible to make HP look bad (basically, if he's town it implies that his biggest scum read is HP by far but his vote is on Skelda who his closest thing to a case on is 738 where he links a bunch of posts and calls them terrible) while voting the most likely alternate lynch.<br><br>HF has to die today, end of story.<br><br>Other things: HF's flailing is so intense he seems abandoned to me, I don't think either (presumably) of his scumbuddies are supporting him.

I mean, I know implosion is scum now, but damn. <br><br>Yes, it's stupid to forget that you have a neighbor role. But of the two scenarios:<br>1 - town forgets about neighbor thing because it's not really a power role that helps town and both Skelda &amp; Ant_to_the_Max have been very low quantity posters.<br>2 - scum forgets that they are linked to a town player which can confirm his claim or call him out on being a liar if she claims anything else.<br><br>The second is much, much, much dumber and less likely. Remember, by nature scum are much more careful because if they slip up, they can fuck things up for their whole team. Whereas if town fucks up (hi Albert B. Rampage!) then it's somewhat less devastating because there are much more town to picks up the pieces and learn from what happened. <br><br>RECAP: Scum forgetting that they are linked to someone that can call them out on a fakeclaim is much less likely compared to town just forgetting about a non-powered power role.

I'm saying that Skelda looked at her role pm when she got it, didn't really think much of the fact that she was a neighbor, and never really remembered it in the future. I'm saying that she looked at her role, thought \"oh, i'm mafia\" and never really paid attention to her being a neighbor. I'm also saying that it's less likely that Skelda-town would have looked at her role pm as a town neighbor and thought \"oh, i'm town\" without thinking of herself as a neighbor.<br><br>It's more natural to think of oneself as \"mafia, my specific role doesn't matter that much\" than to think of oneself as \"town, my specific role doesn't matter that much.\" Especially with a role like neighbor, which many people wouldn't really take advantage of. <br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>WHILE TITUS WAS HINTING TO HER THAT SHE IS FORGETTING SOMETHING.

And titus hinting to her that she was forgetting something is meaningless, she should have remembered regardless of her alignment based on that. <br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>And that the scum scenario is STILL MORE LIKELY than space cadet town forgetting HER ROLE. <br><br>Stop trying to lynch town and lynch your scum-buddy RachMarie.</div></blockquote><br>Yes. I see the scum scenario as significantly more likely than space cadet town forgetting their role. Skelda-town would have had to forget *her entire role*. Skelda-scum would have had to forget that she was a neighbor. <br><br>It's also easy to forget things like that within a scumteam - say that a scumteam had a neighbor, a roleblocker and a goon. It's easy, as any of the roles, to think of your role as \"mafia, on a team containing a roleblocker and a neighbor.\" It's easy to think that even as the neighbor if you never really pay attention to the fact that you are a neighbor. No such psychological explanation exists if Skelda is town."}

I haven't looked at the game ETL posts but certainly a concern for him to post meta about him town lynching town Rach in a different game and how this game he thinks the same of how she acts this game and so he goes for a lynch again? So you don't learn from your mistakes, or you don't use meta like you expect others to or its a convenient excuse to say see I was town when I lynched town Rach here so I have to be town now?!? Right!? So we got some vi, some hypocrisy and some scum motives in there. Perhaps some combination. <br><br>I'm in agreement with kk over the likely hood of skelda being town. To get scum out it you are assuming skelda is so slow and forgetful that I'd assume he couldn't feed himself. Considering scum neighbor would have more things to remember its likely to forget one certainly but less likely to forget everything. Being neighbor. Scum at. Neighbor qt. Where as as town he forgets neighbor or doesn't really pay attention to neighbor and that explains a lot. Also from my little play experience and read thoughs scum are much more careful of slip ups or try to force them. We could go the complete opposite direction and skelda thinks his neighbor is town as well. Doesn't want to out the neighbor as if he dies or his neighbor dies town might suspect the other as scum. Now it's as far fetched as skelda forgets everything. As I don't think he's that good of a player nor do I think he's that bad of a player. The not checking vote count closer might be a concern but I think there was a miscounted as last I looked they were both at l-2 on vote count. <br><br>Elyse vs ETL is worse then fights earlier. Certainly feel on the game detachment it though hopefully the more activity can help there, but I'm concerned on what's going on there as they aren't trying to form a wagon or convince people seems more of a show."}

I was guessing that Fusion blocked me to try to protect me from a kill after n1, but given that neither of my shots have registered it's moderately likely that scum know that I'm a power role some way or another. I softclaimed on d1 immediately after seeing EPM's gunsmith claim because it was a gunsmith claim, and I wanted a softclaim out there in case he ever got a false positive on me. The softclaim is the first letters of posts 503, 504 and 506.<br><br>Other things relevant:<br><br>-Part of the reason that I thought EPM's investigation choice on ant was very good was because I thought he was a very good vig target, having been very lurky and moderately likely to be scum. I could understand the justification having gone through a similar decision process myself.<br><br>-Part of the reason that I think Skelda is scum is that I think GS+JK+2-shot Vig+town neighbors is a bit more power than I'd expect in a 13p normal. I could be wrong about that, though. That's also why I started pushing Skelda more strongly after Skelda claimed neighbor. I do legitimately think that the reasoning I gave for skelda-scum applies, but a more significant reason that I feel that way is because of balance concerns. That's also why I tried to shoot Skelda last night.<br><br>-I see it as moderately likely that I'm going to claim today anyway, either to defend myself or to try to push Skelda scum, and I want other people to weigh in on the balance issue. I also think I'm probably useless as a PR at this point, as I would have to get both shots off to be useful and I can no longer be confident of that. <br><br>Discuss."}

The fact that <span style=\"font-style: italic\">neither</span> of my shots went through means, most likely, that I was blocked both nights.

I had absolutely no reason to softclaim before seeing the GS claim. I didn't know back then that my shots were going to be blocked. I thought I was a confirmable power role. The GS claim gave me a reason to softclaim it. That also really isn't convenient as scum, given that scum wouldn't have the possibility of two shots to back them up. Granted, that statement applies to me too. But I guess what I'm saying is that my claim would not have any convenience value as scum; I'm not a person who was under a huge amount of pressure. Why would I, as scum, claim 2-shot vig here, and risk a counterclaim? There is a dead GS. If someone counterclaims me then you have more of a case for calling me scum, but really, a 2-shot vig claim as scum is not convenient in the slightest when the existence of a GS would make the existence of a *REAL* vig much more likely. <br><br>This isn't about gunsmith without a vig being considered bastard modding (it isn't).

The only case in which it can possibly cause harm is if another PR claims, and if another PR claims then we can probably lynch between that claimant and myself unless they claim something very weak given that GS/JK/2-shot vig/some form of neighbors is a fairly typical amount of power for a 13p mini normal. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Humble Poirot wrote:</cite>Tl;DR: Implosion's claim, despite his claims that is inconvenient for scum to make is just perfect for scum to claim.

Those are probably three of my closest posts in this game. I made those three posts during/right before physics, because i was skimming the game and saw the softclaim. And a letter being inside a parenthesis doesn't stop a scum member who's explicitly looking for softclaims or who just notices a conspicuous V in the first letter of a post and decides to look at the next couple posts.

However, I also know for a fact that I am a town 2-shot vigilante who has tried to shoot people on the first two nights and has not lost a shot.

If you want that, it's <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&amp;t=19505\" class=\"postlink\">here</a> although most of it was lost to the crash (my claim is there though).<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Look at most of the responses. </div></blockquote><br>And then look at your response.

For the same reason that a doctor might claim and push a lynch on someone who claims jailkeeper. I think there is probably too much claimed town power.

There wouldn't be no risk to this claim; if I were scum, I would be taking the rather large risk of a counterclaimant.</div></blockquote><br>I'm sorry but this is such a bullshit argument.  If you're scum, you KNOW there's no vig or there would've been a shot already.  The pool of non-claimed players is VERY small and part of that pool could be scumpartners.<br>You could've easily tracked/watched someone as scum as well for even more info.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>implosion wrote:</cite> This makes the claim \"convenient\" in the sense that i could theoretically be scum claiming it. It does not make it convenient in that it makes me look scummy, which is a disincentive to make the claim as scum.</div></blockquote>In the balance of things, the majority seemed to instantly buy it.  The only one who didn't was aphix but only after I detailed my concerns, did others seem to start wondering about the likelihood of the alleged blocks.<br><br>About the too distanced in time, my point is that if you KNEW you were going to breadcrumb then and there, you probably could've thought the posts and post them in close succession.  But we could chalk it down to style.  I still think that breadcrumb is practically impossible to see and that your belief that someone would look for it AND find it is weird.<br><br>The point where you say that you'd make much more effort to fake claim is very relevant.  It nets you \"likely town\" points because considering the type of player you are, I'd doubt that you would go out unprepared and there's also the relation I pointed out towards the wagons (Elyse dropped in favour of Skelda when you claimed). <br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Then why did I breadcrumb vig *on day one* before I would have known that there was no vig?</div></blockquote><br>Easy.  You can breadcrumb 20 roles and no one will know until you point it out.  As for being counter-claimed by other roles, it doesn't matter since when you claimed, there was very few people left to claim and a decent number of roles already out."}

Being concerned about it is quite useless.  At least right now.  If you  think we're scum together and Skelda has just flipped scum (Which was the condition I gave for him vs me mandatory because we would still have a mislynch) then that means that the scumteam would be Skelda-havingfitz-HP and, in 7p, you'd be lynching yet another scum to make it 5 against 1.  Those are pretty good odds to take your time and wonder if a player just bussed his scumteam.<br>- Accusations like these are quite annoying if you don't at least TRY to explain things further and contextualize them.  <br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>While I understand the reluctance, the post by implosion is likely accurate.

The only difference in this case is that this would be a lylo with something extra.

It's a bus as obvious as it gets and havingfitz tried to suggest he wouldn't bus Skelda when I first accused him of being scum.<br><br>The reason why we had such a stall on d2 when havingfitz, Skelda were the competing wagons is that they were both scum.   As for the rest, I'm not sure:<br>ETL seemed to go at Skelda from the get go which could mean a hard bus.<br>Aphix has generally seemed town to me.<br>Elyse is a mystery due to her ABR fiasco.  <br><br>@Implosion:  Why'd you shoot KK and not havingfitz?  <br>I'll have to reread Skelda's interactions soon but one that's possibly quite telling is when havingfitz was competing with me and gaining traction L-2 she jumped from havingfitz to KK (now known to be town).<br><br>in havingfitz first post.  We see a completely tranquil havingfitz when yesterday he supposedly thought I was scum.<br><br>havingfitz answers his own question about why Titus was killed:<br>- Titus was confirmed town after having no gun and Skelda flipping scum neighbor.  <br>- Implosion WASNT confirmed town and if he shot scum (more likely than not) then we'd be in a better situation for scum.<br>- Implosion's lack of kill d2 might be explained by a mafia doc (mafia docs have no guns) or a godfather. <br>- If implosion's shot didn't go through.

But i think that the reason that aphix quickhammered is probably because he can stop my shot from going through. Remember how my first two nights' worth of shots didn't go through at all? yeah. I still don't know why that's the case but it's certainly likely that scum were responsible and if so they may still be able to stop it."}

If I had more time, I'd replace into more games on later days to avoid the issue.  usually end up tunneling someone while keeping an eye open for something better. As bad as EPM's case on ABR was, it knew he was town by meta so I could safely ignore him so you ended up being that early focus. Then since the other focus was ABR and ABR was being pretty town as well, it just kinda ended up being a thing. I pushed on you because the alternative was ABR who was pretty town. Also, I think it was when you dug up my GTKAS about my opinion on ABR that I knew you might very well be town (scum rarely do that much legwork), but it sidestepped a question, so it negated and ugh. I stayed on the tunnel.  Sorry.<br><br>Re: ABR's mason claim: It was bad, but I understand why he did it. He was being double-tunnelled by two town and a lynch seemed likely. So he shook up the game with a PR claim. If nobody else claimed and he wasn't lynched, he might have drawn the NK.

You should let your hackles down. Post-game try to focus on constructive criticism and understanding why others acted the way they did (whether it was a good action or not).

Once you get a read, you dig in like a tick and just shut your ears. I didn't actually have the strongest townread on havingfitz, but your case on him was really bad and you refused to budge on it. Instead you break down everything into a wall and nobody wants to deal with that because you're missing the big picture. If I can give you a big of advice, learn to give your scum-reads a big of rope.

I think it should go without saying that when a vig takes a shot and it fails, they should have a right to know the shot actually was taken and had failed, and you just leave them to speculate about why. Allowing implosion to keep the shots allowed him to unwittingly do more damage to the town by shooting a townie, which goes back to why I'm not too hot about having a scum doctor combined with a vig in a mini.
