Mayor Fegelein had made his most controversial decision yet. The eccentric and paranoid man was worried that with the recent declaration of war on Russia that Russian spies would infiltrate his Town. After a mass stockpile on food, drink and supplies, Mayor Fegelein locked down the Town, denying anybody entry or access to either enter or leave the Town. To many, this may have ruined their lives by denying them the right to visit friends and family, but on the bright side,   at least it would protect them from the Russians, right?<br>\n<br>\nYes.<br>\n<br>\nBut not from the Mafia.<br>\n<br>\nThis new act prevented the Mafia from being able to trade with their associates. Trapped in the town like everybody else, the Mafia decided to create an insurgency to unlock the Town. But the only way that was going to happen was with everybody else dead. Starting with Mayor Fegelein.<br>\n<br>\n*fade to black*<br>\n<br>\n\"BANGBANGBANGBANGBANG!\". A ferocious volley of bullets could be heard roaring through the Town at 2am in the morning. Everybody in the Town was quick to crowd in the Town square as the carcass of Mayor Fegelein, wrapped in a bodybag was quickly dumped into a coffin and taken to the cemetery to be disposed of. During the early hours, a meeting was called with the townsfolk, and in an incredible 13-0 landslide victory, it was decided that the Townspeople would execute one person per day in order to catch the people responsible for this atrocity. The hunt was on to stop the Insurgent force.<br>\n</div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Fegelein, <div style=\"display:inline;color:green\">Town Mayor</div>, was killed Night 0.</div><br>\n<br>\n<div align=\"center\"><hr style=\"height:14px;width:100%\"></div><br>\n<br>\nPlayerlist:<br>\nElyse<br>\nAlbert B.

Additionally, while I agree that he is defending ABR, he refuses to claim that ABR is a townread, using such cop-outs as \"isn't necessarily a bad post.\" When he says that ABR's post \"isn't necessarily a bad post,\" we get two possibilities - either ABR is a nullread, in which case this post from aphix is doing exactly what I said it was doing (talking a whole lot about someone without taking a stance, which is scummy - townies are typically concerned with people that they have reads on, or with forming reads on those who they don't have reads on). Or, ABR is a townread, in which case, why not out-and-out say that ABR is a townread instead of using that phrasing? <br>\n<br>\nIn essence, he is showing that he doesn't believe ABR to be scummy for the reasons provided... yet. He doesn't preclude the possibility that what ABR has done *IS* scummy by saying that it's \"not necessarily\" scummy, and he fails to take any stance on ABR himself, nor does he take a stance on anyone else. <br>\n<br>\nHim giving implicit defense of ABR is scummy on its own, in my opinion. I find explicitness to be a towntell and implicitness to be a scumtell - townies are more willing to simply speak their minds, whereas scum want to leave their options open. His giving a null read on EPM is also scummy after he's been talking about EPM.</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\nEPM: Answer Fusion's actual question.

Be prepared for people to have different opinions.  What you claim is relative.

Which is sad given that all 3 of them are scumreading me. Fusion I already explained, evilpacman's original aggression towards ABR looked genuine and his continued push has also looked genuine. Elyse is honestly originally based on reading <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5399301#p5399301\">100</a> as genuine, which is probably bad since it's the kind of thing that can be genuine even from scum, but meh. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5402596#p5402596\">138</a> feels like a weak question, though, but i can see it being asked by town. I guess i'd classify elyse as a weak townread right now relative to fusion and epm (fusion is a tad stronger than epm i'd say).<br>\n<br>\nIn terms of aphix, looking bad at <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5396787#p5396787\">74</a> I think the thing that set off my paranoia that my scumread was bad is the last paragraph, but on reread it's meh. That whole post just doesn't make me feel a lot. The last paragraph (in response to me) gives me a bit of pause on my scumread, and I'm not sure why. Gut I suppose. But I'm going to ignore that. <br>\n<br>\naphix in general seems to have a fair amount of concern over the quality of discussion that takes place. This could either be because aphix really is interested in the quality of discussion that takes place, or that focusing on telling people to say more useful things is a good substitute for him giving reads. Idk, I think I'm ranting a bit at this point. I think I still lean scum on aphix.<br>\n<br>\nAttempting to get a read on KK: on reread, I find the original fos on fusion mildly scummy (it feels a bit fabricated). The whole way that KK is going about attacking Fusion honestly feels a bit fabricated too... like the line \"The fact that Fusion read your horrible case and called it legit is the real scum-tell in all this. Chances are both you and Albert B. Rampage are town.\" That line feels like an indirect attempt to get ABR and EPM on his side... and it feels like it was done in a non-genuine way. It's difficult to quantify. The first response in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5396714#p5396714\">70</a> also feels a bit off - while it does answer Fusion's question, it leaves some to be desired. Specifically, why is epm's making the case being written off as bad play, whereas Fusion's accepting that case has to be scum play and not just bad play? I think this is kind of why the scumread on Fusion feels contrived - I feel like the justifications for fossing Fusion over other people feel like they were contrived so that KK could fos who he wanted to fos for some other purposes (i.e., scum motivation). So I'd lean scum on him atm.<br>\n<br>\nGonna cut this post off here and do more in another post.", "time": "Tue Oct 22, 2013 11:56 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=32269&start=125", "forum": "53", "thread": "32269"}

Your play style is to do nothing day one or at least on dawn. Just let others direct the flow. Not do Anything until you have strong reads? What happens if there are several of this play style in the game? Even with weak reads can you not still make comments or ask clarifying questions? I'm pretty sure we want you to participate. And most importantly of course we want you to be honest why would you even ask that? Your post reads as your asking hp what to do. Play the game. Participate. Scum hunt.

Looking at it in ISO realize the confusion, but I trying to correct my @implosion comment. The rest of your 2-4 reply ... well I'd say I could just copy paste your response here as well.<br>\n<br>\nPost 74 was a comment regarding the argument over Albert's first post. Post 124, fifty posts later, is about the discussion generated over my second vote ... So how is there an inconsistency between me liking one discussion and disliking a different unrelated discussion?<br>\n<br>\nIn response to the gorckat, you can have null reads of that ... But if we all thought the same it wouldn't be the same game. I don't need the internet to play with myself. I still find it odd to say, this guy is scum. This guy is scum, but I'm going to vote a person I'm not talking about, later on explain it as \"a vibe\" which is worse then a scum-dance and worse then fusion just being scum no matter what? <br>\n<br>\nMy move off albert, does come because I don't think a vote there is going to help the game at this point. You moving off the wagon is part of the reason for that, but certainly isn't THE reason. In regards to 164, so now trying to learn the reasons someone is playing how they are in a current game is unrelated to the game? I'm pretty sure motives has something to do with the game or at least has something to do with how I play.<br>\n<br>\nI did start liking EPMs post. \"lean town\" is an indicated it wasn't a strong feeling. Then up through 124 he had a lot imo empty posts. He looks like he's attempting to be busy. A \"concern\" but notice not really any mention of thinking him scum, or any specific scum tells I call out? So, leaning positive, some things I don't like, leaning back. End up back towards the middle. <br>\n<br>\nNow we go back to 74 and 124. Answered above.

Scum don't do that on Day 1 because it's usually way too obvious and scum try to be more careful. Scum are much more likely to support bad cases in a sideways manner in order to either help push them along or to gain a favorable relationship with the townie making the bad case.<br>\n<br>\nI'm reading evilpacman18 as town right now because you look like scum sucking up to him, not because of any of his actions. You're explanation as to why you got an early townread on evilpacman18 is because of tone. Which is a pretty vague and easily bullshitted reason for a townread. I also read post 29 as faint backing. <br>\n<br>\nIn post 83, I asked you to explain further:\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5398148#p5398148\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5398148#p5398148\" data-post-id=\"5398148\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 83</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9811\">Kublai Khan</a> wrote:</cite>Also, how did evilpacman19 look like he was hunting for scum? He declared he had found scum and his reasons were bad. How is that hunting?</div></blockquote>\nAnd you ignored these questions.<br>\n<br>\nIn post 73, you also asked \"What is the scum motivation in attacking a strong player right out the gate with a dubious case?\" This may have been a valid reason to get a townread on evilpacman18, so I asked you to provide some sort of evidence that you knew Albert B. Rampage was a strong player. But despite my making it perfectly clear that I wanted <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">your</div></div> opinion on Albert B. Rampage, you just pointed out my thoughts on the matter, which continue to be irrelevent. Since you won't, or can't, provide evidence that you knew Albert B. Rampage to be a strong player, then that reason is bunk as well.<br>\n<br>\nSo.

There he details his method of getting scum lynched. He also links a game in his examples of good focus section where he displays how he gets a player (bookitty) lynched. He also links another game at the bottom of the page which I also read where a scum player says this about him: \"<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Setael (scum): Yeah [Albert], but no one can compete with your \"shove it down their throats\" style.

You're now just trying to see how many things you can nitpick and paint them as scummy (which makes me very confident of my vote).  How is the number of the page relevant at all?  Is my announcement too early?  (which is funny since everyone else voted before).  Is it too late?<br>\n<br>\nThe fact that you're trying to pretend that someone would not think before voting or would never announce their reads or possible votes (see EPM's announcement of you being scum before he voted you) only comes from scum is absurd.<br>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>The norm is starting the day with firing random votes in every direction and using any excuse imaginable to get the game moving.

Last time I checked, the norm was not saying \"I don't scumhunt yet\" when prodded about your lack of useful activity.  As for the justification thing... It's an attack that's impossible to defend against.  I make cases with justification, of course I do.  Because I intend to lynch the people I pursue because I think they're scum (Which is why I hesitate to get into the RVS process not to lose the power of my vote).

You were first accusing me of making a fool of myself and now I'm smart scum that asks too many sharp questions that you can't answer so you look bad?  How about trying to answer them or, at least, specifying WHY you can't answer instead of keeping with the emotional nonsense about my persona.<br>\n<br>\nYou're painting a movie picture.

I call them as I see them.  If I think I misrepresented someone or that my BS or fallacy call was unwarranted.  I'll happily retract it.  As it is, I saw your vote on implosion as BS and rightfully called it so.  I don't need to caress your hand while scumhunting you.

You had done NOTHING and provided no reads because you claimed to have none (except the implosion vote which at the time, didn't seem very strong, did it?).

He goes on at great length throughout the day about this, such as in <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5398640#p5398640\" class=\"postlink\">post 94</a>, <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5399211#p5399211\" class=\"postlink\">post 98</a>.<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5407172#p5407172\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5407172#p5407172\" data-post-id=\"5407172\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 159</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=12137\">Humble Poirot</a> wrote:</cite>Tl;Dr: On the verge of voting ABR but awaiting some responses.</div></blockquote>\n\nThirdly, he uses a cheap trick, quoted above, to add the illusion of credibility to his future vote. Why would a townie try to setup a future vote, on page 7? The norm is starting the day with firing random votes in every direction and using any excuse imaginable to get the game moving. What in the world is up with this guy being on the verge of voting someone...? Let me tell you. He A) feels the need to justify his vote and B) is planning his strategy in advance. <br>\n<br>\nOf course, it looks bad if I can't answer his questions, because they are too sharp and I have nowhere to turn to, to defend myself. <br>\n<br>\nUnless...<br>\n<br>\nUnless, he doesn't actually have a question, he just wants to provoke me and proceed to push the strategy he pre-planned in his head.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Humble Poirot wrote:</cite>Do you have no reads? If so, why did you make that bs up about implosion?</div></blockquote>\n\nIs that actually a legitimate question he expects me to answer? I disagree that \"I made up bs about implosion\". I think there was a disconnect in what implosion said. Poirot may think it was a stretch, but the setup of his questioning and the subsequent vote is scummy.<br>\n<br>\nHe demonstrates a lack of genuine interest in obtaining information; if he did care, he would ask neutral, objective questions that allow the person to present their thoughts in a different way. <br>\n<br>\nInstead, he resorts to asking bait questions, and follows it up with apparent dismay at my uncooperativeness for not responding to him.<br>\n<br>\nTwice, he claims that it's a hard game. It's not a hard game. The reason we haven't been doing anything, and I want to put emphasis on this, is because bandwagons are not being pushed. We can hardly get to half a wagon for a lynch on any one player. Do you think we can scumhunt in these circumstances? Town will not compromise on their reads, scum will not wagon-hop, and we're wasting the day away. Change that with me now. Let Poirot hang.</div></blockquote>\nI actually really like this post and agree with it mostly.<br>\n<br>\nBut HP came up with some good responses and you just ignore him? Wtf is that?<br>\n<br>\n@HP<br>\nFusion is a strong townread for having similar thought processes to my own, gut, being willing to (and changing) reads as new information comes in, and for things mentioned before.<br>\n<br>\nAs far as ABR being a strong townread, that's gone. I don't have scum meta from him but yeah I don't like how he's just ignoring you (especially since his case was decent). I feel like he's either lazy, frustrated town or lying scum who can't come up with a good response to you.

So you are on the HP side of the debate? Now I agree with HP on most of his points and his views in this. But what specifically do you agree with? Is it just what HP is saying? Is there something ABR is doing that you don't like? More then choosing sides would be nice. Lets hear your views on this then throwing your support in with HP, where later on you can say, well, HP was wrong, he fooled me. I just don't think choosing sides is good psychologically for the game either.<br>\n<br>\nMy views: I'm currently very concerned with ABR saying he's ignoring HP and brushing of the whole thing. The whole, HP is mean I'm not playing with him doesn't really benefit anyone. ABR we all know there is more going on then you and HP arguing. That doesn't mean you can just dismiss the whole thing. It's also a concern his activity level/content level has changed due to HPs claims. I agree that ABR is responding with appeal to emotion, and then distancing himself from the discussion. I don't think we should let it cool off and him slip away. I'm not sold on a lynch at this point, but we need some sort of discussion point or we just stagnant. ABR seems to be knee jerk voting at this point. Not a big fan of that either.<br>\n<br>\nEspeciallyTheLies entrance isn't a concern for me as it seems to be. I certainly look forward to hearing her views on the game. Nothing to change the read on this slot yet.<br>\n<br>\n@Skelda: What are your view points on this game? I'd like to see some more reads out of you. Certainly would want more then the reasoning on your last vote to sell me on anything. IMO we has humans see something we don't understand as different. Which might explain his vote more aversion to misunderstanding then some sort of scum motivation. <br>\n<br>\n@Elyse: Why are you so sold the AzBlueM//EspeciallyTheLies is a scum slot? Care to post your current case?<br>\n<br>\n@Everyone: I know everyone doesn't like doing reads, but current view points on the game? Anything? Seems like even some of the votes have been sat on for some time.<br>\n<br>\nDefinitely curious where Ant_to_the_max, gorckat, havingfitz and skelda are currently. Seems like we are well into the game and I know post count isn't everything but always dislike having a huge discrepancy. <br>\n<br>\nAt this time not much has changed in my reads. HP right now is still strong town read. More recent posts continue supporting it. Fusion aside from the dislike I mentioned above still read town, and even that post goes along with what I've read from his posts that may not be great posts, or great plays or a strong player but still comfortable with read there.<br>\n<br>\nDo still want to get some ISOs for personal reference even if I'm not doing a full public breakdown anywhere.

He made a post against Albert with mostly legitimate concerns. I agree that Albert's vote on implosion is BS. I asked him how sure he was about his implosion vote. He never bothered to respond. HP's concern here is a very valid one - one that I had as well (Albert's implosion vote). Further the fact that Albert doesn't push implosion is deeply concerning and against what he says in his guide. I wanted to ask about this as well but I first wanted to make sure that Albert indeed had a strong scumread on implosion.<br>\n<br>\n2) Alberts realizes that HP is serious about his vote. He knows that persuing implosion while a player like HP attacks him will be very difficult.<br>\n<br>\n3) Albert decides that the best way to deal with HP is a head-on collision and OMGUSes HP. <br>\n<br>\n4) Albert says that HP wants to \"provoke him\" and \"asks bait questions.\" While I agree that HP's style is unique and is rather aggressive and contains leading questions, a quick look through at HP's town-meta shows that it fits his town style to a T. Albert hasn't done this research or attempted to figure out HP's affiliation. He is using baseless accusations that look good on the surface to attack HP.<br>\n<br>\n5) As HP gets more aggressive towards Albert, Albert attempts to frustrate him further attempting to make him look bad by refusing to read his posts, answer his question and push more junk suspicion on him saying things like \"<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">I will engage with you when you calm your tone down and post something readable</div>.\"", "time": "Thu Oct 31, 2013 6:35 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=32269&start=275", "forum": "53", "thread": "32269"}

This is the kind of thing I talk about of <div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">people trying not to take responsibility</div>.  If ABR is an easy mislynch, I'm a fairy godmother.  People all around seem to want to call him town for the weirdest things  This excuse scummy meta thing in MS needs to stop, last time I was voting  saki and people called her town for \"retracting her fake PGO claim\".  She only got lynched because cop inspected her and was replaced by another player, also scummy but more active.  Inactivity is a great defense.  If you post less, there's less things people can attack you with and you can leave your options open.  <br>\n<br>\nFurthermore, you call it a mislynch on a competent player's faults when he has shown no competency whatsoever during the course of this game.  How can you call him scummy and silly and lacking town motivation but also saying \"a competent player's faults\".<br>\n<br>\nBtw, you're voting a similarly sized wagon atm.

(the alternative could be Elyse for skelda).<br>\n<br>\n- The thing we have to look is the same thing as always.  Considering ABR flipped town and I think ETL is town as well, it means the only two \"likely\" wagons were on townspeople.  So we should see who had no problems with things either way and who were passionate about their lynches.  The ones who didn't care that much are more likely to be town, since they can just coast and avoid responsibility.<br>\n<br>\n- Elyse is a damn enigma.  His actions are absolutely surprising.  So damaging and yet, he still finds a way to make you second guess that he might just be town, even after making one awful choice after the other.<br>\n- As I pointed out in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5436682#p5436682\">526</a>.  Could Elyse REALLY think that ABR or her would be killed over a claimed jailkeeper?  You have to be really bad to think that way.<br>\n- Elyse's intervention in ABR's lie outted 2 PRs.  One is dead because of it and the other will likely die tonight.<br>\n- Why was Elyse so keen to know if EPM had inspected her?<br>\n- Elyse's vote on me d2 straight off the bat is awful.  One of those \"Oh, town player who died said lynch X, first post of the day, let's not aknowledge anything, just lynch X\".<br>\n- Elyse's reasoning is beyond terrible and it has been demonstrated with the two PR reveals.

You said I was defscum at the end of d1 (When I wasn't there). <br>\n<br>\n- The fact that EPM has a result means that scum don't have a RB role.  Which is quite interesting.<br>\n- The fact that there's a gunsmith, means that there could easily be an sk who shot JK or was jailkept.  Or a vig.<br>\n<br>\n- gorckat reads town through the whole interaction with Elyse.  <br>\n<br>\n- The fact that ABR claimed Fusion was part of the scumteam (OMGUS) despite Fusion having claimed JK even when he didn't need to (which made him obvious town) already speaks volumes about his pathetic excuse of a guess.  The fact that I'm reading gorckat as town and that the other player is me seems to lay the groundwork for an extremely funny post-game where I hope ABR gets all the mocking he deserves.<br>\n<br>\nhe can't even get ONE guy right from a reduced pool (EPM and fusion were obvtown).<br>\n<br>\n- ETL is still likely town due to his willingness to get lynched yesterday.<br>\n- implosion still reads town.<br>\n- ETL's point in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5437448#p5437448\">583</a> about skelda's rehearsed point seems accurate.  <br>\n- havingfitz whole interaction voting me and then unvoting looks awful.  Pure opportunism.<br>\n- the ant inspection is excellent.  considering the low activity and the fact that it means he is likely town (Which is better than a scum find, considering the circumstances).<br>\n- If anyone has cracked the game open.  It's EPM, I think he is spot on about havingfitz in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5445073#p5445073\">616</a> (I signalled his convinient change of stance towards me when he switched to \"To be determined\".<br>\n- I still feel the same way about aphix too.

Although, as I write this, I have quite a hard time believing that would be the case (which is why, despite all my doubts and wanting to know more, I don't put her in the actual guess).

You use these words but don't actually provide reasoning that stands up for itself.  \n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div> Throwing out a buzzword like opportunism to describe the act of suspecting someone and opting for that suspect over one not suspected is absurd.

The opportunism vibe stems from the fact that you tried to push my lynch without explaining anything, making use of ABR's absolutely questionable claim (you might pretend it was clear, but it wasn't and that's proven by the fact that it was fake).<br>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Nothing &#8220;convenient&#8221; about my change in stance towards you.

It did catch the scummiest player who should've been lynched.  I've been catching scum lately or at least, removing a very anti-town player (who lies as town) from the game.  This has happened in my last recent games.  I've also been quite favorably impressed by my record of late.  I don't write novels because I want to show off, when I write them, it's because I feel there's something worth pointing out.  If there's relevant info out there, it must be placed for scrutiny.  You don't have to spam, but it's a good thing to express your points and logically debate things.<br>\n<br>\nYou're already adding plausible deniability to your vote, btw.

Unless scum is dumb enough to believe the 1 shot claim I would be surprised if legit EPM survived the night.  And the only time his claim does us any good (if he IS town) is when he's dead and his investigation/s are confirmed.<br>\n<br>\nSo yeah Skelda...I don't necessarily believe EPM's claim because it's not enough to overcome the body of his play so far.

Pretending he actually thought I was scum was quite a stretch.  His long post on me was BS and the rebuttal is there for people to see.  He never replied to that because \"I hurt his feelings\" and later proceeded to ignore me until that vote out of nowhere.  It looked like he just wanted to save himself by eliminating those who called for his lynch (me, fusion) and that was actually true. <br>\nFurthermore, after being conviniently inactive, he tries to get ME quicklynched without explanations and with half a claim when barely anyone had shown willingness to vote me and there was 1 day left to deadline.  <br>\n<br>\nI can't believe you don't understand the logic of a compromise lynch in deadline.

He was lying to save himself.  You lied to apparently save him.  It's almost worse than what he did.

If you want to convince someone that I'm scum, you better analyze the content of what I say, not dismiss people who call me town and say they're doing it due to \"playstyle\".<br>\n<br>\nWhat's the scumteam, KK?<br>\n<br>\nprev-edit:  Skelda/KK:  This line of conversation is futile.

Hopefully you can understand this without any fancy formatting or quoting. <br>\n<br>\nFirst, a question for every one... how many people keep track of who has atownread on them with this many players left inn the game?  I personally don't, but I want to do a quick survey before i conclude that its a scummy thing. Scumreads I can understand,  but townreads feels like a \"who do i have in my back pocket\" mentality. <br>\n<br>\nOkay, speaking of mentality,  this is my main concern with humble poirot and the mafia mason thing. Mafia mason is not just an anachronistic role, it's a bastard role and therefore impossible. So i feel the only real reason to bring it up is if he believed that Albert b. Rampage <br>\nmight be a mason, but wanted to discredit him amongst other mason members. If elyse is claiming mason with a huge scumread, why not suspect elyse at any point? reading it felt like humble poirot was stretching to keep elyse and Albert at opposite ends of the reads spectrum and i can't figure out a  towny reason to.  Why three lack of paranoia towards elyse?<br>\n<br>\nThe 4) answer isn't fluff.  It's a false flag.  Humble Poirot isn't refuting my case in good faith, he's scrambling to attack everything I'm doing as scummy in an attempt to\"win\" this exchange.  It's massively defensive behavior which i admit that both scum and town do, but the difference is that town generally post a care then tunnel.  Scum Errol just tunnel, forgetting that just posting suspicion isn't enough to justify their behavior. <br>\n<br>\nAnd havingfitz isn't attacking evilpacman18 as a defense to the case against him. That makes no sense.  Epm didn't investigate his,  so it's moot. He is either ignorant of perfectly acceptable investigation strategy (if he had day talk scum mates, they would correct him) or he's paranoid s fuck  (a town tell, duh).<br>\n<br>\nThere's probably more to  say, but i have to work now and I'm tired of fighting this cdamn autocorrect.", "time": "Mon Nov 11, 2013 7:18 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=32269&start=675", "forum": "53", "thread": "32269"}

Posts like 726 are fantastic and super pro-town. But the end of Day 1 troubles me. The situation is that there is a deadline approaching, a wagon leader, and a sudden and corroborated mason claim. EspeciallyTheLies, implosion, Fusion, and evilpacman18 all had town gut reactions. A sort of careful, calculating \"how can we best use this situation to town's advantage\". Your thought process when posting/thinking quickly is alien to me. Mafia Masons is an obscure/baffling theory to thought out there. Because I can't understand your thought process from a towny point of view, I don't trust you. Keep in mind that Day 1 is the ZERO information day and for you to claim 100% certainty of scumread is troubling.<br>\n<br>\nNow I've gone about questioning you in a very bad way as a result of technological, time, and sleep limitations. But in turn I think you have been needling me for provokation purposes. Also, I think I've only ever seen scum use an \"read my iso for answers\" defense, then accuse people of misrepresenting them when they don't reach the conclusions you want them to reach. And I don't understand the accusation of \"reporting\" at all.<br>\n--<br>\nI have every right to be frustrated at this game. A majority of players are either absent or only looking for surface shit. At least two people (evilpacman18 and Skelda) seem to only be voting for me because I disagree with them. I mean, that's as far as I can reason given that they are only willing to call me \"bad\" and \"scummy\" and \"narrow-minded\" while voting me.<br>\n<br>\nAlso, there is incredibly naive \"Khan defends X, therefore scumpartners\" talk happening.

To call my contradictory opinion of EPM's actions bullshit is bullshit.</div></blockquote>\nIt is conceivable, but \"saying sensical things\" implies i think they're based in genuine thought. <br>\n<br>\nAs for your second question you kind of answered that yourself... all town base a good deal of suspicions of others based on THEIR OWN experiences as town. NOT on *your* experiences as town. People are different, they have different experiences of what is town and what is scum. <br>\n<br>\nYou are accusing EPM of being scummy because <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">YOU</div> would not have investigated ant. Here, I am saying that I also would have investigated ant. Plenty of other people on this site also would have investigated ant. Your attack is bullshit because you're saying \"oh, you didn't investigate who I think you should have? You're scum.\" Him investigating someone that you wouldn't have does not have scum motivation. <br>\n<br>\nI'll look at more of this page later, possibly right now.", "time": "Wed Nov 13, 2013 1:09 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=32269&start=725", "forum": "53", "thread": "32269"}

Changing is certainly going to a thing, but I don't feel it changes naturally.

He seems to switch votes to who votes him. He keeps throwing suspicion on EPM. Which I obviously don't much like his claim or his investigation, but either its true and we find out soon enough or he doesn't get killed soon and we know, which you seem to agree with so why keep bringing it up and arguing about it, aside to make noise. I feel like he's going with the most convenient wagon at the time and don't think he's strongly backing any specific,  throwing around items to see if they stick. I'm concerned where all his reads come from and where they go. Maybe he's just too advanced of a player for me. But I don't follow his reasoning. <br>\n<br>\nAs for the Skelda bit, not sure if I see a lot of alignment indicative tells, just a lot of horrible player tells. So I'm not sure where to go with that.<br>\n<br>\nStill comfortable with my HP townread. Still dislike KK, predominately on 730, but it could certainly read as just frustration with the game as he mentions. Gorckat calls everyone else for not agreeing with him. And drunk votes me, because of my vote, others response to my vote is pretty natural. Gorckat takes it far, 'because of what we know.' Like he thinks I'm trying to start a wagon there, instead of discussion. Then he disappears again, null to scum there, similar to D1. Still upset that ant has responded any where. Still not much pinging on ETL, I think it's confusing that people this he's scum d1, he even calls himself out on lurking d2 and no one is concerned there.

Or if you want to hide behind buzzwords, can you at least use them correctly?<br>\n<br>\nLet's break down the massive amount of stuff wrong here.<br>\n1) Putting words in quotations is a logical fallacy in itself. It's an appeal to motive. You are trying to get people to question my motives merely by presenting them as questionable. You've brought forth no corresponding evidence to back up your charge that I'm not actually frustrated.<br>\n2) Appeal to emotion is a broad category of logical fallacies.  And they are fallacies because they are attempting to sway people by inducing an emotional response in the listener. By reading my rant, did I intimidate you into agreeing with me? Did I make you pity me? Even if you can't pin-point the exact emotion I'm attempting to play on, can you at least show a logical endpoint to my accused manipulation? <br>\n3) By listing me as being emotional, you are conducting an ad hominem fallacy (specifically poisoning the well). You are attacking character instead of argument. In fact you haven't addressed the actual argument at any time, you've just characterized it as emotional (actually, going an additional step and falsely claiming it's fallacious) and therefore not worthy of consideration. <br>\n4) You're also committing a hasty generalization fallacy. Mafia is a game of individuals. Individuals do not automatically become more logical when they get a town role and conversely scum do not become less logical. I get the general idea that scum have to twist logic to make innocent players look guilty, but over-zealous town players commit the same logical fallacies all the time over and over. Seeing a player commit a logical fallacy is not a scumtell, please stop describing it as such. I'll grant that it's not a towntell. But lack of good does not mean bad (aka affirming the consequent fallacy)<br>\n5) Not the mention the constant tunneling you're doing. Or, more formally, assuming the conclusion. Anything can be used as evidence that someone is scum if you already believe that they are scum. <br>\n<br>\nSo stop with your whole \"logical fallacy = scum\" rationalizing. Everyone commits multiple logical fallacies constantly. So if you are town, then you're never going to be accurately scum-hunting as you are only targeting the player and not the role. Scum will love you because they can easily manipulate you. <br>\n<br>\nDespite all the fallacies you've committed, I'm starting to come around that you might be town. Just bad town with an anti-town (overly verbose) posting style. You need to stop attacking semantics and start answering the heart of what's being asked of you.<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5464548#p5464548\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5464548#p5464548\" data-post-id=\"5464548\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 778</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=12137\">Humble Poirot</a> wrote:</cite>KK, what's going on?

You didn't realize regardless of who voted first, I started the wagon with <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5471320#p5471320\">830</a>? Where I tested the waters. That lead to the KK vote and the subsequent post where implosion says, he'll consider that. If you notice implosion later on see's there is no steam in that wagon and changes his mind quite quickly. Titus makes the quick town points in immediately deciding to call out some quick scum team based on my vote, in defense there he does have a natural response although concerned on the misreading of vote count.

I've posted about as many questions as I have posts. Try explaining me trying to engage other players and get more information and try to help form an actual viewpoint on what they are saying is a scum play.

Good scum (and yes, I'm self-absorbed enough to call myself good scum) doesn't lie continually about everything. 95% of their posts will be honest and the remaining 5% will go towards pushing mis-lynches.Right now, you're making cases that try to point out that 95% of what your targets say is dripping with scum mis-intention. Which is either poor play or scummy play on your part.<br>\n<br>\nIf havingfitz is scum, all he has to do is point out that you're tarnishing his behavior and.. it's perfectly believable. Because you are. Of course, if he's town he'd do the same thing because the reaction he's displaying is independent of alignment. It's a normal reaction to ridiculous accusations.<br>\n<br>\nSame goes for me. I didn't \"forget\" about Skelda (and I don't \"supposedly\" think he's scum) and I'm not \"pretending\" to shake up the game. I mean, I can't even defend against that because there's no argument. You're just casting aspersions on my motivations without providing an explanation as to how any of my actions could even potentially scummy besides \"it must be scummy because you're doing them\".<br>\n<br>\nAlso, aphix didn't follow me.

I thought interacting with me would involve more interesting stuff than \"MD\" but sure.  I don't know if I have a method but basically, I try to look at motives for why people do what they do and probe many people to see how they respond and if it makes sense from their POV.  So nothing is inherently scummy or townie but needs to be analyzed by context.  <br>\n<br>\nI could also answer something that I didn't bother earlier.  Yes, I know the Socratic method.  It's hard to ensure continued replies in mafia and not lose track but I guess you could say I apply it unintentionally sometimes (Like the whole KK interaction where I show how he clearly lied - I'm now trying to see if he lied as scum or town because his attitude has left me with doubts.  Anyway, I'm kinda pushing that hard analysis off, from now.

It's difficult to phrase well, but essentially, if Skelda is town, then Skelda forgot their role and essentially \"made up\" the VT claim from nothing.

I too want to live in a world where scum forget that they are linked with another player before making a fakeclaim. Have any of you ever been scum before? I mean, I know implosion is scum now, but damn. <br>\n<br>\nYes, it's stupid to forget that you have a neighbor role. But of the two scenarios:<br>\n1 - town forgets about neighbor thing because it's not really a power role that helps town and both Skelda &amp; Ant_to_the_Max have been very low quantity posters.<br>\n2 - scum forgets that they are linked to a town player which can confirm his claim or call him out on being a liar if she claims anything else.<br>\n<br>\nThe second is much, much, much dumber and less likely. Remember, by nature scum are much more careful because if they slip up, they can fuck things up for their whole team. Whereas if town fucks up (hi Albert B. Rampage!) then it's somewhat less devastating because there are much more town to picks up the pieces and learn from what happened. <br>\n<br>\nRECAP: Scum forgetting that they are linked to someone that can call them out on a fakeclaim is much less likely compared to town just forgetting about a non-powered power role.

I'm saying that Skelda looked at her role pm when she got it, didn't really think much of the fact that she was a neighbor, and never really remembered it in the future. I'm saying that she looked at her role, thought \"oh, i'm mafia\" and never really paid attention to her being a neighbor. I'm also saying that it's less likely that Skelda-town would have looked at her role pm as a town neighbor and thought \"oh, i'm town\" without thinking of herself as a neighbor.<br>\n<br>\nIt's more natural to think of oneself as \"mafia, my specific role doesn't matter that much\" than to think of oneself as \"town, my specific role doesn't matter that much.\" Especially with a role like neighbor, which many people wouldn't really take advantage of. <br>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>WHILE TITUS WAS HINTING TO HER THAT SHE IS FORGETTING SOMETHING.

I see the scum scenario as significantly more likely than space cadet town forgetting their role. Skelda-town would have had to forget *her entire role*. Skelda-scum would have had to forget that she was a neighbor. <br>\n<br>\nIt's also easy to forget things like that within a scumteam - say that a scumteam had a neighbor, a roleblocker and a goon. It's easy, as any of the roles, to think of your role as \"mafia, on a team containing a roleblocker and a neighbor.\" It's easy to think that even as the neighbor if you never really pay attention to the fact that you are a neighbor.

I haven't looked at the game ETL posts but certainly a concern for him to post meta about him town lynching town Rach in a different game and how this game he thinks the same of how she acts this game and so he goes for a lynch again? So you don't learn from your mistakes, or you don't use meta like you expect others to or its a convenient excuse to say see I was town when I lynched town Rach here so I have to be town now?!? Right!? So we got some vi, some hypocrisy and some scum motives in there. Perhaps some combination. <br>\n<br>\nI'm in agreement with kk over the likely hood of skelda being town. To get scum out it you are assuming skelda is so slow and forgetful that I'd assume he couldn't feed himself. Considering scum neighbor would have more things to remember its likely to forget one certainly but less likely to forget everything. Being neighbor. Scum at. Neighbor qt. Where as as town he forgets neighbor or doesn't really pay attention to neighbor and that explains a lot. Also from my little play experience and read thoughs scum are much more careful of slip ups or try to force them. We could go the complete opposite direction and skelda thinks his neighbor is town as well. Doesn't want to out the neighbor as if he dies or his neighbor dies town might suspect the other as scum. Now it's as far fetched as skelda forgets everything. As I don't think he's that good of a player nor do I think he's that bad of a player. The not checking vote count closer might be a concern but I think there was a miscounted as last I looked they were both at l-2 on vote count. <br>\n<br>\nElyse vs ETL is worse then fights earlier.

I was considering waiting until KK's case on me for this, but meh.<br>\n<br>\nI'm a 2-shot vigilante. <br>\n<br>\nI tried to shoot ant n1, skelda last night. Both times, as would be apparent, they didn't die. The mod has informed me that I didn't lose shots in either case (i.e., I still have two shots left). I was guessing that Fusion blocked me to try to protect me from a kill after n1, but given that neither of my shots have registered it's moderately likely that scum know that I'm a power role some way or another. I softclaimed on d1 immediately after seeing EPM's gunsmith claim because it was a gunsmith claim, and I wanted a softclaim out there in case he ever got a false positive on me. The softclaim is the first letters of posts 503, 504 and 506.<br>\n<br>\nOther things relevant:<br>\n<br>\n-Part of the reason that I thought EPM's investigation choice on ant was very good was because I thought he was a very good vig target, having been very lurky and moderately likely to be scum.

I could be wrong about that, though. That's also why I started pushing Skelda more strongly after Skelda claimed neighbor. I do legitimately think that the reasoning I gave for skelda-scum applies, but a more significant reason that I feel that way is because of balance concerns. That's also why I tried to shoot Skelda last night.<br>\n<br>\n-I see it as moderately likely that I'm going to claim today anyway, either to defend myself or to try to push Skelda scum, and I want other people to weigh in on the balance issue.

Granted, that statement applies to me too. But I guess what I'm saying is that my claim would not have any convenience value as scum; I'm not a person who was under a huge amount of pressure. Why would I, as scum, claim 2-shot vig here, and risk a counterclaim? There is a dead GS. If someone counterclaims me then you have more of a case for calling me scum, but really, a 2-shot vig claim as scum is not convenient in the slightest when the existence of a GS would make the existence of a *REAL* vig much more likely. <br>\n<br>\nThis isn't about gunsmith without a vig being considered bastard modding (it isn't). It's about the existence of a GS making the existence of a vigilante *more likely*. That alone would make my claim an inconvenient claim for scum to make.", "time": "Tue Dec 03, 2013 10:30 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=32269&start=1275", "forum": "53", "thread": "32269"}

Those are probably three of my closest posts in this game. I made those three posts during/right before physics, because i was skimming the game and saw the softclaim.

I've only fakeclaimed significantly once as scum before.

If you want that, it's <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&amp;t=19505\" class=\"postlink\">here</a> although most of it was lost to the crash (my claim is there though).<br>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Look at most of the responses. </div></blockquote>\nAnd then look at your response.

And furthermore, a vig isn't the only role that could counterclaim me here if i were fakeclaiming scum - if I were scum I also would have been risking counterclaims from any of the roles mentioned in EPM's <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5436362#p5436362\">495</a> (bg, joat with a bg or a vig or a cop, possibly others).<br>\n<br>\n<div align=\"center\"><hr style=\"height:14px;width:70%\"></div><br>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>There you go again.

Being concerned about it is quite useless.  At least right now.  If you  think we're scum together and Skelda has just flipped scum (Which was the condition I gave for him vs me mandatory because we would still have a mislynch) then that means that the scumteam would be Skelda-havingfitz-HP and, in 7p, you'd be lynching yet another scum to make it 5 against 1.

I considered SK but it would make little sense to draw the kill (even if he was immune) because he could be easily found out by scum which could lead his lynch.<br>\n- Scum has yet to make a kill choice because there was always a \"mandatory kill\" thanks to the claims and that deprives us a bit from info.<br>\n- 6p would usually mean NL but with a cleared player it can also mean a sort of Lylo.  The only difference in this case is that this would be a lylo with something extra.

It's a bus as obvious as it gets and havingfitz tried to suggest he wouldn't bus Skelda when I first accused him of being scum.<br>\n<br>\nThe reason why we had such a stall on d2 when havingfitz, Skelda were the competing wagons is that they were both scum.   As for the rest, I'm not sure:<br>\nETL seemed to go at Skelda from the get go which could mean a hard bus.<br>\nAphix has generally seemed town to me.<br>\nElyse is a mystery due to her ABR fiasco.  <br>\n<br>\n@Implosion:  Why'd you shoot KK and not havingfitz?  <br>\nI'll have to reread Skelda's interactions soon but one that's possibly quite telling is when havingfitz was competing with me and gaining traction L-2 she jumped from havingfitz to KK (now known to be town).<br>\n<br>\nin havingfitz first post.  We see a completely tranquil havingfitz when yesterday he supposedly thought I was scum.<br>\n<br>\nhavingfitz answers his own question about why Titus was killed:<br>\n- Titus was confirmed town after having no gun and Skelda flipping scum neighbor.  <br>\n- Implosion WASNT confirmed town and if he shot scum (more likely than not) then we'd be in a better situation for scum.<br>\n- Implosion's lack of kill d2 might be explained by a mafia doc (mafia docs have no guns) or a godfather. <br>\n- If implosion's shot didn't go through.

But i think that the reason that aphix quickhammered is probably because he can stop my shot from going through. Remember how my first two nights' worth of shots didn't go through at all? yeah.
