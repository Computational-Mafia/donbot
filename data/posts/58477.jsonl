The <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=14372\" class=\"postlink\">site-wide rules</a> always apply.<br>\n2. If you have a question for me, you are welcome to PM me. If you need to talk to me in thread, please bold your question with a signifier indicating that it's for me. This will help me notice and locate it better.<br>\n3. Do not use hidden or encrypted text.<br>\n4. Do not use any form of provable randomness. Saying you rolled a dice or flipped a coin and acting upon it is okay. Using any sort of RNG tag is not.<br>\n5. Pretending to break a rule will be treated the same as actually breaking the rule. Don't do it.<br>\n6. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#68228B\">Purple, hex code #68228B, is my color. Don't use it.</div></div><br>\n7. Don't attempt to impersonate me or pretend to be the moderator.<br>\n8. I reserve the right to change the rules. Any rule changes will be posted in thread.<br>\n9. Breaking a rule may result in a punishment deemed appropriate to the offense (ranging anywhere from a simple warning to a modkill/force-replacement).<br>\n10. The moderator (me) has the final word.<br>\n11. Have fun.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Behavior Rules</div></div><br>\nKeep things civil. Even though the game can and is expected to be competitive, we're all here to have fun. If there is a dispute, try to settle it in thread. Force-replacements/modkills can ruin games and I'd appreciate it if we could avoid that avenue.<br>\n1. Harassment of an individual player is not permitted.<br>\n2. Antagonism is a part of the game, but should only be kept in the spirit of the game.<br>\n3. Expressing frustration is fine. Directing it towards others as a personal attack is not.<br>\n4. Attack the post, NOT the poster.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Activity Rules</div></div><br>\n1. If a player doesn't post within 48 real life hours, they will receive a prod.<br>\n2. If a player doesn't pick-up AND respond to the prod within 24 hours, a replacement will be sought. I will also start immediately looking for a replacement after the third prod.<br>\n3. If you will be V/LA, please alert me in the thread AND via PM.<br>\n4. Each game day phase will last 14 real life days.<br>\n5. Each game night phase will last 48 real life hours.<br>\n6. If a player has a night action, but does not submit a choice before the deadline, they will perform no action.<br>\n7. In the event a replacement must be found, I may, at my discretion, extend the deadline. This will be announced in thread.<br>\n8. I reserve the right to extend the deadline if I deem it necessary.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Voting Rules</div></div><br>\n1. Votes must be at the beginning of a new line AND bolded. Both voting formats of <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Player Name</span> and <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: Player Name</div> are acceptable. Abbreviations, missing punctuation, and misspellings will be accepted as long as it is obvious who is being voted for. If I perceive it as a vote, then it's a vote.<br>\n2. If I make a mistake in the vote-count, please notify me either in thread or via PM.<br>\n3. Unvoting is not required for changing votes.<br>\n4. Once a simple majority of votes is reached, that person will be lynched.<br>\n5. After a lynch is achieved, all living players, including the lynchee, may continue to post until I lock the thread.<br>\n6. If you are dead, stay dead. Do not post. Not even a \"Bah\" post.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nThere is guaranteed to be at least 1 Vanilla Townie in this set-up.<br>\n<br>\n<fieldset style=\"border:3px outset grey;padding:5px 10px\">Hello!

I agree EspressoJet is giving off a strong scum vibe, as many people have mentioned above the way he was so emotional and over defensive when justifying his actions seems like newb scum to me.

So I abandoned it because I again am trying to be more efficient. Basically, I do not feel like I have enough evidence to try and prove BJC is scum in day 1 seeming that his actions reflect a townish personality so I was going to back off, focus on someone more efficient on D-1 and then on D-2 or so try to re-evaluate and see if there's more proof or less proof towards the idea of BJC being scum or town.", "time": "Mon Jul 21, 2014 10:01 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=58477&start=100", "forum": "53", "thread": "58477"}

There was a lot of pushing against my claim after people had already seemed to agree (except maybe phok) that it was legitimate. There seemed to be a level of tunneling, as he repeated himself once or twice after I had already answered his question, which was odd. All the same, no reason to lynch me on it even if you think I'm lying, because I would be most likely the last scum and trading my win con for a Cop is ludicrous. Quote of havingfitz's Day 1: \"Was thinking of voting Espressojet before I realized I actually like my current vote [Prof. Fridays].\" This could go both ways. It could be reason why he would tunnel me, since he had already had his mind set on me-scum, but he also wasn't on his scumbuddy's wagon, and it seems like this might be an attempt to divert it. Perhaps I'm talking myself out of havingfitz scum... I think there could still be something there. SKOT could also be scum, but he voted Marky Mark Day 2 BEFORE Albert claimed the guilty investigation (\"Looking over the vote count Marky Mark stood out as co-scum\"), which gives him a lot of town points... Huh. I might have to reconsider this.</div></li></ol><br>\n<br>\n<ol style=\"list-style-type:decimal\"><li>Are you a Cop? <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">No</div><br>\n</li><li>Which players do you consider to be town/lean-town? <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Marquis, phokdapolees, Clusk92, SKOT</div><br>\n</li><li>Which players do you consider to be scummy? <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Anatole Kuragin</div><br>\n</li><li>Which players are you unsure about? <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">havingfitz, bjc</div><br>\n</li><li>Who is your top scum read and why? <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Anatole Kuragin. A lot of it is by PoE; none of the others make sense, except possibly bjc. My thinking is if Anatole flips town, lynch bjc, as he specifically said he preferred an Anatole lynch to an Espresso lynch Day 1 (though he was open to an Espresso lynch, which all sounds very scummy to me; \"I'm willing to bus my scumbuddy to look town, but I'd prefer to not lynch my scumbuddy\"). Anatole's been pretty active, but that doesn't mean anything in the scheme of things. It seems to make sense that he would want to establish himself as a contributing \"obvtown\" and prey on the lurkers. Additionally, while Anatole has a lot of posts, his words-per-post is very low. This isn't meant to be a damning case; Anatole just seems the most scummy of what's left. At the end of the day, I'd be willing to lynch him or havingfitz.</div></li></ol>", "time": "Wed Aug 06, 2014 4:19 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=58477&start=500", "forum": "53", "thread": "58477"}

The only power roles in the game were the tracker, doctor, and neighborizor. With the hit or miss nature of the tracker role, this set-up was favored towards the scum-team. The neighborizor was a wildcard that was added to hopefully balance things out for the town side. Daytalk was given to both factions outright because the neighborizor did not resolve immediately during the night.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: </b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\">Tracker<br>\nDoctor<br>\nNeighborizor<br>\nVanilla Townies to 13<br>\n<br>\nMafia Goon<br>\nMafia Goon<br>\nMafia Goon</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\nThe town played very well, being able to lynch two of the three scum with the first two lynches, essentially making the tracker as strong as a cop. Albert was fortunate enough to neighborize the tracker on Night 1, and by working together, they were able to create a neighborhood of confirmed townies that would help protect the tracker from the scumteam and create a follow the tracker scenario. By using a chain of decoys, SKOT was able to make it to mylo almost completely unnoticed by the scumteam. Prof Fridays could have done better with his protections, but I felt he did an okay job overall, even if he let the first claimed cop die. His claim was also pretty well done (albeit borrowed from Venmar) to help him buy at least another night phase and prevent himself from getting NK'ed.<br>\n<br>\nDespite losing both of his partners at the beginning of the game, bjc was able to survive to mylo. I felt he was able to ride out his early towncred fairly well as people only suspected him based on process of elimination. If his teammates were more fortunate, he could probably have pulled this one out.<br>\n<br>\nI enjoyed moderating this game as it was very interesting with all the twists town was able to create.

My Day play was better than my Night play for sure. I took a gamble with Albert due to some confusion, but I thought I could get away with it anyway. I like to try to be unconventional when I can afford to be, and unfortunately, it backfired on me, though I was right in that I could afford it. At the end of the day, I'm not sad. I learned a lot from this game, and, well, it's a game! No sense in getting caught up in regrets of what could have been, especially with a win.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nEverybody makes mistakes.
