The <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=14372\" class=\"postlink\">site-wide rules</a> always apply.<br>2. If you have a question for me, you are welcome to PM me. If you need to talk to me in thread, please bold your question with a signifier indicating that it's for me. This will help me notice and locate it better.<br>3. Do not use hidden or encrypted text.<br>4. Do not use any form of provable randomness. Saying you rolled a dice or flipped a coin and acting upon it is okay. Using any sort of RNG tag is not.<br>5. Pretending to break a rule will be treated the same as actually breaking the rule. Don't do it.<br>6. <span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #68228B\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Purple, hex code #68228B, is my color. Don't use it.</span></span></span><br>7. Don't attempt to impersonate me or pretend to be the moderator.<br>8. I reserve the right to change the rules. Any rule changes will be posted in thread.<br>9. Breaking a rule may result in a punishment deemed appropriate to the offense (ranging anywhere from a simple warning to a modkill/force-replacement).<br>10. The moderator (me) has the final word.<br>11. Have fun.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Behavior Rules</span></span><br>Keep things civil. Even though the game can and is expected to be competitive, we're all here to have fun. If there is a dispute, try to settle it in thread. Force-replacements/modkills can ruin games and I'd appreciate it if we could avoid that avenue.<br>1. Harassment of an individual player is not permitted.<br>2. Antagonism is a part of the game, but should only be kept in the spirit of the game.<br>3. Expressing frustration is fine. Directing it towards others as a personal attack is not.<br>4. Attack the post, NOT the poster.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Activity Rules</span></span><br>1. If a player doesn't post within 48 real life hours, they will receive a prod.<br>2. If a player doesn't pick-up AND respond to the prod within 24 hours, a replacement will be sought. I will also start immediately looking for a replacement after the third prod.<br>3. If you will be V/LA, please alert me in the thread AND via PM.<br>4. Each game day phase will last 14 real life days.<br>5. Each game night phase will last 48 real life hours.<br>6. If a player has a night action, but does not submit a choice before the deadline, they will perform no action.<br>7. In the event a replacement must be found, I may, at my discretion, extend the deadline. This will be announced in thread.<br>8. I reserve the right to extend the deadline if I deem it necessary.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Voting Rules</span></span><br>1. Votes must be at the beginning of a new line AND bolded. Both voting formats of <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Player Name</span> and <span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: Player Name</span> are acceptable. Abbreviations, missing punctuation, and misspellings will be accepted as long as it is obvious who is being voted for. If I perceive it as a vote, then it's a vote.<br>2. If I make a mistake in the vote-count, please notify me either in thread or via PM.<br>3. Unvoting is not required for changing votes.<br>4. Once a simple majority of votes is reached, that person will be lynched.<br>5. After a lynch is achieved, all living players, including the lynchee, may continue to post until I lock the thread.<br>6. If you are dead, stay dead. Do not post. Not even a \"Bah\" post.<br><br><br><br>There is guaranteed to be at least 1 Vanilla Townie in this set-up.<br><br><fieldset style=\"border:3px outset grey; padding:5px 10px\">Hello! Welcome to Mini 1590!<br>You are a Vanilla Townie.<br>You have no special abilities except for your vote and your brain.<br>You win when all the threats to the town have been eliminated and there is at least one town-aligned player remaining.<br>The game thread is here.</fieldset><br><br>The existence of Daytalk is known."}

I agree EspressoJet is giving off a strong scum vibe, as many people have mentioned above the way he was so emotional and over defensive when justifying his actions seems like newb scum to me. However there are multiple scum to be found so I don't see how Espresso acting scummy should have any bearing on whether you think Bjc is scum or not. As a town we are trying to pin down multiple scum players, so your \"either-or\" mentality between Bjc and Espresso looks like scum trying to find somebody to lynch.<br><br>2.) \"I then tried to see if anyone had evidence that could support or help me to willing to back off just because I started to feel less certain.\" - This just reads scum to me. You are essentially saying you wanted to back off and so <span style=\"font-style: italic\">then</span> appealed for evidence that would allow you to do that - trying to match the evidence to your actions rather than making actions based off the evidence.</div></blockquote><br><br>You're reading way too much into my wording like BJC mentioned.<br><br>I am trying to say that I felt really suspicious of BJC, but his evidence made me less suspicious. So I abandoned it because I am trying to help track down and get rid of scum. If I continue to push for a wagon that may end up leading to a mislynch, how will that help anything? So I abandoned it because I again am trying to be more efficient. Basically, I do not feel like I have enough evidence to try and prove BJC is scum in day 1 seeming that his actions reflect a townish personality so I was going to back off, focus on someone more efficient on D-1 and then on D-2 or so try to re-evaluate and see if there's more proof or less proof towards the idea of BJC being scum or town."}

There was a lot of pushing against my claim after people had already seemed to agree (except maybe phok) that it was legitimate. There seemed to be a level of tunneling, as he repeated himself once or twice after I had already answered his question, which was odd. All the same, no reason to lynch me on it even if you think I'm lying, because I would be most likely the last scum and trading my win con for a Cop is ludicrous. Quote of havingfitz's Day 1: \"Was thinking of voting Espressojet before I realized I actually like my current vote [Prof. Fridays].\" This could go both ways. It could be reason why he would tunnel me, since he had already had his mind set on me-scum, but he also wasn't on his scumbuddy's wagon, and it seems like this might be an attempt to divert it. Perhaps I'm talking myself out of havingfitz scum... I think there could still be something there. SKOT could also be scum, but he voted Marky Mark Day 2 BEFORE Albert claimed the guilty investigation (\"Looking over the vote count Marky Mark stood out as co-scum\"), which gives him a lot of town points... Huh. I might have to reconsider this.</span></li></ol><br><ol style=\"list-style-type: decimal\"><li>Are you a Cop? <span class=\"noboldsig\">No</span></li><li>Which players do you consider to be town/lean-town? <span class=\"noboldsig\">Marquis, phokdapolees, Clusk92, SKOT</span></li><li>Which players do you consider to be scummy? <span class=\"noboldsig\">Anatole Kuragin</span></li><li>Which players are you unsure about? <span class=\"noboldsig\">havingfitz, bjc</span></li><li>Who is your top scum read and why? <span class=\"noboldsig\">Anatole Kuragin. A lot of it is by PoE; none of the others make sense, except possibly bjc. My thinking is if Anatole flips town, lynch bjc, as he specifically said he preferred an Anatole lynch to an Espresso lynch Day 1 (though he was open to an Espresso lynch, which all sounds very scummy to me; \"I'm willing to bus my scumbuddy to look town, but I'd prefer to not lynch my scumbuddy\"). Anatole's been pretty active, but that doesn't mean anything in the scheme of things. It seems to make sense that he would want to establish himself as a contributing \"obvtown\" and prey on the lurkers. Additionally, while Anatole has a lot of posts, his words-per-post is very low. This isn't meant to be a damning case; Anatole just seems the most scummy of what's left. At the end of the day, I'd be willing to lynch him or havingfitz.</span></li></ol>"}
