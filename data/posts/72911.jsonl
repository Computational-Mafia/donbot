Scum reading me isn't the only thing.

A post telling me to not make you angry. Another saying, \"if you have questions, just ask\".

Can you explain to me how calling people bad players foster cooperation?</div></blockquote><br>this is you twisting my words imo. <br><br>I never said asking me questions would make me angry. That is actually part of why I do the things I do. I WANT people to interact with me. What I don't want though is people to just attack me without trying to understand my thought process. That doesn't read like a townie mindset and that is why I end up scum reading people who scum read me. <br><br>The whole bad player/cooperation thing also feels like twisting. Especially since I haven't called anyone bad yet. In the end I won't be able to cooperate with everyone, hell given my history in the end I probably won't end up being able to cooperate with anyone but let's see how things go."}

Just the language he's using - \"the only thing that stopped me from changing my vote to him\" and \"it didn't really help to lower my suspicions\" look like scum separating themselves from a partner who's had a bit of focus recently - \"I didn't vote for him because of *reason* but I'm still suspicious!\"<br>Robbnva - null leaning town. [T= #161] [S= Again, general hesitance to town read.] I liked his reactions to Necro's pushing. That's the only reason I have so far for my read. His interactions with Havo are ??? question marks but his other posts are okay.<br>Tchill - null leaning town. [T= #191] [S=]. He's not been massively active in-thread but i liked some of the posts he's made. <br>Havo - null leaning town. [T= #113] [S=]. His interactions defending Robb were interesting and something I want to look at, but not scummy enough for me to want to push for a d1 lynch for either of them yet.<br>Fykus - null.

Their tone feels town and also their questions and interactions seem to logically come from a town perspective. I like this guy. <br>Lovelife - interacts a lot, isn't afraid to share opinions or to put themselves out there for scrutiny. Appears to be thinking about other player perspectives and trying to sort them. Their tone sometimes feels a bit off or blunted to me sometimes, and a capable scum player could pull off their game. Doesn't mean they are scum though, just something I'm keeping in mind. <br>Sofiel - Not really enough activity for my liking so far, however she has had some good interactions. The questions are pertinent and her tone feels quite town. More activity of this kind would solidify them in my mind as a town player to work with. <br>Tchill13 - This is the flimsiest of my town reads because their activity is a bit low as well, but their posts seem to be trying to steer people towards working together. There's been a little bit of unproductive conversation that Tchill has seemed to try to get us off. This isn't a huge or very strong town play, but it's slightly indicative of alignment I believe. Enough that I feel better about them than some of the other players so far.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #BFBF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Could go either way</span></span></span><br>Robbvna - I've so far found them to be stand-offish, yet they say they want to cooperate. I find their overall tone off-putting and they seem to jumble their words and ideas around, but I can't really say it's a deliberate or definitely scummy thing. They're on vacation now and they professed to dislike the early game, and based on what others have said about them I'm willing to allow space for that and let them be for now. However if their input into the game doesn't show improvement then I think they're likely to be mafia.<br>Hopkirk - They feel quite out of place so far and cagey about their activity levels, as if they're aware that their low input relative to others makes them look bad. But they're asking questions and appear to be trying to solve the game. Their tone feels off but they do seem to be trying to solve the game with their small amount of content so far.<br>Havo - This is someone that concerns me because despite their high activity, I can't quite place their motives or intent. They seem quite ready to agree with me and are voting Cloud with me. Although I don't really like the way they painted Cloud's reads as something inherently 'fake' and also impede the way others play. 'Too early for bull in the china shop' seems like a strange statement to make. They often make commentary on other people's play, without making the effort to actually understand it first. The tone feels almost combative in some cases, and even though I agree with their conclusions on some things I wonder about their 'process' for getting there.<br>IgnitionUSMC - Their most recent post is a really big red flag to me. This one:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9508704#p9508704\" class=\"postlink\">post 394</a>, IgnitionUSMC wrote:</cite><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #BF0080\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Im pulling my vote back off because at this point we need to either just wagon someone.</span></span></span> I've also been extremely busy at work and Im just not used to this fast of a game pace from where I came from.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #BF0080\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">If you want me to list my scum reads... honestly im not sure at this point.</span></span></span> But i agree with Tchill on <span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #BF0080\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">id rather save my lynch for lynching mafia, then policy lynches followed by a night kill by mafia. At least give town a chance to lynch mafia</span></span></span></div></blockquote><br><br>The highlighted parts are the bits I dislike. <br><br>1. Removing your vote because you think we just need to wagon someone - isn't removing your vote the exact opposite of trying to achieve this goal?<br>2. You think we should just wagon someone, but you're not sure who. Alright, I could accept this as making sense if not for the next point #3<br>3. Wanting to make sure we lynch mafia.<br><br>If you want to really try and lynch mafia, but you're not at all sure who might be mafia - how can you be okay with just wagoning someone? Wouldn't you want to try figure out where to direct the wagon first? I'm very interested in IgnitionUSMC's responses to this.<br><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #BF0000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">The bad</span></span></span><br>BBT - please interact and play the game. I think that it's much more likely that scum plays like this early game, where it's hardest to come up with reasons for things and scum can often be caught.<br>Fykus - seems to be poking at people in ways that don't appear town to me. In many cases it's like they're prodding at a person specifically, rather than trying to figure out their intent or motive. They're very lacklustre in their hunting so far.<br>Jordarrian - This would be where my second vote would go. Introduces themselves, gets put under pressure and responds to that. Once the pressure is gone, they disappear from the game and apparently are no longer interested. This is not how I've seen town play.<br>Cloudkicker - Honestly has just been ridiculous so far. Claims to dislike RVS, but their attitude towards the game has not changed a single bit since leaving RVS. Makes a post and then references their own post as being a town-like post that mafia wouldn't do, and their reasons for why they are not mafia are not backed up at all. They claimed mafia would not have 6 \"townleans\" this early, because it would be too hard to explain that many townleans. But that's exactly what they've just done; they haven't explained them. When questioned on one of them they simply said something to the effect of it being \"lowest on the list\" and haven't explained or given reasons for any of them so far. Saying scummy things and then pretending you were joking isn't solving the game and I think they're very likely mafia trying to play the \"too scum to be scum\" card. The only other explanation is that they're just playing awful as town out of spite, but I'd also expect them to be more adamant and emotive if that were the case. When town do that, it's usually easier to read. This just seems like a poor attempt at it. At best they're a very lazy, disengaged and unproductive town member - which is more likely to be scum than people trying to play the game."}

I like it a lot over all, I especially like that it came from necro, who is my strongest town read atm. A reads list from another player might have been more interesting, but necros read list will definitely be a useful tool and I appreciate the effort in making it so in depth. Ill be back home tomorrow, where i plan to type up my own read list, or maybe just a player analysis since I feel a lot of players could be either side atm."}

Also, for someone who was attacking Robb for his lack of reasoning in voting for pisskop (which, btw, seemed like a disingenuous way to try and distance himself from Robb), GR is sorely lacking any real reason for scumreading BBT, other than that everyone else thought BBT was scum. I'd bet money GR can't come up with a good reason for scumreading BBT that someone else hasn't already pointed out before him."}
