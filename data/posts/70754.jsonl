Site rules may be found <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=6470\" class=\"postlink\">here</a> for reference. Note that playing to win condition is a requirement.<br>02. The rules are subject to change at my discretion to correct any errors or omissions. Should any changes be implemented, they will be announced in the same format as the original rule (for example, changes to the main set of rules will be announced in the main thread; changes to role-specific rules will be sent by PM).<br>03. Pretending to violate any of these rules will be treated the same as an actual violation.<br>04. Everyone is here to have fun, and I hope that we will all keep this in mind throughout the game. Please contact me directly (by PM) with any problems or questions. In the event that I make an error, please call it to my attention by PM or by addressing me in the relevant thread (<span class=\"noboldsig\">I will look for \u201c@Mod\u201d</span>).<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Posting</span></span><br>05. Players should use English exclusively, without any form of hidden or encoded text.<br>06. Once I have declared a player to be dead, that player should not post in the main thread until I have declared the game to be over.<br>07. Players should not provide direct quotations from, images of, or other provable references to any game-related PM or PT.<br>08. Players should not use any form of provable randomness for any reason.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Timing</span></span><br>09. Each Day Phase will last 240 hours. Each Night Phase will last 48 hours. Deadlines may be extended at my discretion as necessary to ensure that the game continues smoothly. Any such extension will be announced in the main thread.<br>10. Players who have not posted in 48 consecutive hours will receive a prod. After receiving a prod, a player has 24 hours to post before I will begin seeking a replacement. Players on V/LA will be exempt from these prod requirements; however, if a player requires an extensive period of V/LA, I may determine that the game would be better served by a replacement and replace that player at my discretion.<br>11. Players who do not make sufficient attempt to participate (including--but not limited to--players who require repeated prods) may be replaced at my discretion.<br>12. If a player being replaced for inactivity should return to the game before a replacement is found, that player may be allowed to continue in the game at my discretion. However, once a player has been replaced, that player may not continue in the game.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Day Phase</span></span><br>13. Players may vote to lynch another player using either vote tags or bold tags as demonstrated below.<br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Name</span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: Name</span><br>In order to be counted, votes should appear on a separate line and not within spoiler tags or otherwise concealed. Votes not following this format may be counted if I believe that a vote was intended.<br>14. When one player has achieved a majority of votes (more living players voting for that player than living players not voting for that player), that player will be lynched and the phase will end. If the deadline is reached before a lynch is achieved, no player will be lynched.<br>15. Players may vote to end the phase without a lynch. An example of such a vote is given below:<br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: No Lynch</span><br>If the number of living players voting for this option is greater than or equal to the number of living players not voting for this option, the phase will end without a lynch and the game will proceed directly to Night Phase.<br>16. Players may continue to post in the main thread until I have announced the end of the phase, regardless of whether or not a lynch has occurred.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Mod Posting</span></span><br><span style=\"color: #0000FF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">This is my color, please refrain from using it. This is #0000FF</span></span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Game Design</span></span><br>17. In addition to the site-wide rules, it may be useful to review the <a href=\"http://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Normal_Game\" class=\"postlink\">Normal Game guidelines</a> and the <a href=\"http://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Natural_Action_Resolution/Normal_Game\" class=\"postlink\">Natural Action Resolution guidelines</a>.<br>18. Any PT associated with this game will be open for use at all times (Day Phase and Night Phase). <span class=\"noboldsig\">Every PT related to this game will be made public after the game is over.</span><br>19. No player may perform more than one action during a single Night Phase.<br>20. At least one player will receive the following role:<br><div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: </b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display: none;\"><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Role: Vanilla Townie<br><br>Powers: You have no powers outside of your voice and your vote.<br>Win Condition<br>You win when all anti-town members have been eliminated at at least 1 town member is alive</div></blockquote></div></div></div>"}

I would be suspicious of someone presenting a two page thesis on why a player is scum that early.

There was no need for anyone to answer this question. Only agree or disagree with the implied observation.<br>- DogWatch's question was so ridiculous to my ears that Shadow Step is allowed to flag this as suspicious (I DO NOT agree with his conclusion though).<br>- I think DogWatch is stuck in confirmation bias here. In regard to Dogwatch's vote, Shadow Step described it as: \"Scum are survivalistic, town are less so. As town you're not as worried about getting lynched as you are as scum. As scum you quickly want a CW.\". THUS, Shadow was reading Dogwatch's non-alignment play as scummy. <span class=\"noboldsig\">Why can't town vote for someone when they are under pressure? Why can't town be survivalist?</span><br>- bottom line: I lean on stubborn-town Shadow projecting what he thinks is conclusively scum-indicative on DayWatch's non-scummy play."}

I'm kinda sketched out by him getting the free 1-shot (that's a nasty scum trap if ever there was one), but there are no super strong town roles (follower the strongest but way weaker than, say, cop or vig or probably even jailkeeper), so it's debatably ok.  Still, hitting a scum and then losing a BP puts town back to odds, and that's kind of a pretty big deal, especially with the multiple roles that can potentially track down a kill on the desperado."}
