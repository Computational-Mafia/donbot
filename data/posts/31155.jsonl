I\u2019m your host, Cabd. This is a normal setup for 13 players.<br><br>The contestants:<br>1.\t<strike>Fegelein</strike> notscience<br>2. <strike>Banksys Flareon</strike><strike>FuDuzn</strike> Titus<br>3.\tSound of Silence (hydra of GuyInFreezer and Fferyllt)<br>4.\tRail Tracer (hydra, private heads)<br>5.\tartemiskitty (hydra, private heads)<br>6.\tH<strike>umble Poirot</strike> <strike>ranaway</strike>Cephrir<br>7.\tBrian Skies<br>8.\t<strike>Mario and the Diamonds</strike> beastcharizard<br>9.\tRebel Without a Pulse (Hydra of Nachomamma8 and stubbsKVM)<br>10.\t<strike>HopefullyCynical</strike> <strike>Mogamma</strike> Prohawk<br>11. \t<strike>Saki</strike> Natirasha <br>12.\t<strike>zakk</strike> Daniel Bryan<br>13.\tDessew<br><br><br><br>Now, onto \u2018da rules. Rules that are sorta-ish unique are bolded.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">1. I don\u2019t tolerate ad hom wars. If your posting is merely insulting a player without providing game content, you can expect a strike from me. Three strikes, you\u2019re out. I\u2019m fairly lenient about this, but posting \u201cFuck you\u201d over and over again is simply not acceptable. Severe issues will be reported to the list mod(s).</span><br>2. If I say it violates these rules, it does. You can take it up with me postgame if you wish.<br>3. Play towards your win condition. Gambits are fine, directly harming your own team is not.<br>4. Once a lynch is reached, you may continue discussion until I lock the thread. No votes or unvotes will count after a lynch has been achieved.<br>5. A lynch is achieved as a majority of players voting for somebody. Half is not a majority.<br>6. Do not quote or pretend to quote any information you get from me via PM. This includes posting your role card verbatim. Paraphrasing is fine, as are role claims naturally.<br>7. Do not talk about this game anywhere else, or with anyone else.<span class=\"noboldsig\"><br>8. If you have family that plays mafia with you, great. However, if there\u2019s any overlap in computer usage, please PM me before the game starts so that we don\u2019t have any accusation of alt cheating.</span><br>9. Do not discuss ongoing games in this thread. This includes games on sites other than mafiascum. This also includes using [redacted] as that loophole does not fly here.<br>10. I am rather lenient upon activity. You must post once every 72 hours. Failure to do so will earn you a prod. Respond to your prod within 24 hours, or face replacement. Three prods is also a force replacement.<br>11. Day phases will be 2 weeks long. Day 1, however, will be 3 weeks long. All night phases will be 48 hours.<br>12. I do not require unvotes. Your vote will be counted so long as you bold it or use the vote tag. Shorthand names are fine so long as it\u2019s clear who the vote is for.<br>13. If you have a question, please PM me. I\u2019m an addict that sits around on his inbox all day anyways. If a question is something that should be answered publically, I will make a post addressing it without naming who asked it.<br>14. If my vote count is wrong, you can PM me or post in the thread about it.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">15. I do not fix tags or edit posts, even if you ask me to.</span><br>16. I reserve the right to add to these rules or modify them, but only when I post notifying all players in the game of the change.<br>17. Loophole abuse is all fun and games until I modkill you. Don\u2019t try it.<br>18. Blue (<span style=\"color: #0000ff\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">This color</span></span> at #0000FF)is my color. You are welcome to use any other color of the rainbow.<br>19. Encryption, text hiding, and the like are silly. Don\u2019t do it.<br>20. Extensions will be granted at 48 hours per replacement, up to a total duration of 6 days max per game phase.<span class=\"noboldsig\"><br>21. Do not use temporary information to convey messages. This includes your signature and your avatar, but is not limited to these things.</span><br><br>Sample VT rolecard:<br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>    Hello, Cabd, and welcome to the Cash Cabd. You are a Vanilla Townie. Your weapons are your voice and your vote. You win when all players remaining are aligned with the town, or nothing can prevent that from happening.</div></blockquote>"}

The mafia used this to their advantage.<br><br>The hydra did post under the wrong account several times, but seeing as how it was a relatively short game, I don't see this being an issue.  A little more work from the teammates should make up for this shortcoming.  People are human after all.  We all make mistakes.

How is this any different from another player/slot making it to lylo?<br><br>Yes, the hydra screwed lylo by placing a vote on a town member.  But is this a mistake that only hydras make?  Or is it common between all players, regardless of player/slot type?<br><br>Why should it matter if they had no problems about it?  The game was already over at that point.  They were convinced they knew who mafia was, and they acted upon that.  If you can't make a decision like that without conviction, why make it at all?"}

There is always evidence presented in a case, but it doesn't mean the evidence is relevant or accurate.  And I'm not discrediting the possibility of him knowingly using bad evidence to support his claim (this is WIFOM and I didn't want to mention it, but it's still a suspicion I had).  The important thing for me to read him is to discern how much of it is him just having bad experiences with hydras and how much (if any) of it is him intentionally painting them as suspicious or directing the attention towards them."}

Brian's first post about hydras was to agree with HP.  Something to the effect of holding the hydra accountable for the views expressed by both heads.  As other players picked at HP's comments, he expressed agreement with some of those points.<br><br>It was all that agreement with somewhat divergent viewpoints that led to my original comment that Brian seemed overly agreeable.  Mafia is an inherently antagonistic game.  As players get a better feel for who may be on their team, cooperation is possible, but page 1 is not usually when town-recognition happens among players who don't know each other really, really well, especially not mass-town-recognition.  This impression is mitigated by his degree of experience with forum mafia.  And he's given me a town impression in other posts since then.<br><br>The NS argument is bad.  NS should have first crack at sorting it.  I don't think he has yet, though I find it hard to follow NS sometimes because he usually doesn't quote or otherwise reference the post he's responding to."}

Some of HP's posts aren't the most visually appealing to me and I was having trouble focusing on the information because of it (my mind was wandering too much).

I've been liking his reactions to the whole hydra thing. His malleability and admitting that he could be wrong makes me think it wasn't scum motivated. There is still some stubbornness, but given that it is one of his most recent games, I can understand that he would refuse to just let it go. I find the dislike for some things (\"grudge\" seems like too strong of a word in this case) to be rather irrational and people are often just stubborn about it, even if they know they are wrong. It's akin to disliking sports teams even though you can't explain why (kind of like how I refuse to like the Broncos or Cowboys even though I like Peyton Manning and DeMarco Murray).<br><br><br><br>DB has been falling way too fast on my reads list.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">VOTE: Daniel Bryan</span>"}

The only problem I can see is the term usage. SoS didn't have any concrete town reads, but he did have \"leaning\" town reads. It was obvious that these were the ones he felt most comfortable with because of their placement on the list. RWaP's list was completely different in that it didn't label anyone as scum. But it's pretty obvious who the hydra suspects most. <br><br>As for me, this is just how I write my reads list. I use quantifiers because I don't believe in absolutes when dealing with the unknown (ingrained into me from philosophy and English courses). That's just the way I am and it isn't indicative for me. If you are still having a problem with my list, just assume that any read with the word town is someone I believe to be innocent and anyone with the word scum in the read to be someone I believe to be scum. If I'm fencesitting for whatever reason, the read will just read as \"null.\"<br><br>Regarding the last part, this isn't what I said and you know it. Creating a townblock is just another strategy that people may use. This creates an inner circle of trust and allows the players in the inner circle to create more pressure for the players outside of the circle. When the town circle is big enough, it makes it much more difficult for scum to avoid the pressure and makes it easier to catch them. Am I saying this is the most effective strategy? No. What I am saying is that this is a strategy that players may decide to use when they have really strong, mutual townreads. But if a scum does find a way in, then the strategy becomes moot.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5310918#p5310918\" class=\"postlink\">post 394</a>, Humble Poirot wrote:</cite>As for your DB vote, do you realize you seem to have a pattern where you just follow the current trend?

So far I've had an RVS vote on artemiskitty, one vote on you as I was trying to get a read, and now a vote on Daniel Bryan. My last two votes have been on players I've been suspicious of and people I felt were strong candidates to be scum. I hardly consider two votes to be following the trend.<br><br>The DB vote IS real. Like I said before, I read his early catch-up post to be pretty genuine. But he seems to be getting way too hung-up on innocuous details.

Also, DB voted RT after Titus said that he had a scumread on RT. My theory is that (they might be scumbuddies and) DB thought it was a counterwagon attempt and Titus will come up with an actual case. He didn't know that Titus wanted to dive deeply into nullishness, so he won't post any case.

Expresses many of the concerns I had regarding hydras before this <br>\tgame started. I do think it's suspicious that it was so difficult for him to grasp the benefits of <br>\ta hydra without them being told to him, but for the most part, it seems genuine. His vote on an <br>\tinactive player seems like something I would do. He seems hesitant to take his own stances without other<br>\tpeople's opinions.

Hasn't done much, if anything, in helping the town develop reads but has been spending <br>\tmost of his time defending himself.  Although I don't like his reaction and AtE, I do find the reaction <br>\tto be pretty genuine.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">DB    </span>-\tNull. This read is slightly biased. He was originially higher on this list. I liked the transparency in <br>\this catch-up post. He also seems to be pretty busy. But despite the amount of content available in the <br>\tthread, he seems fixated on very specific, surface type issues.

I'm not liking how he only offers an opinion on HC. It seems very direct. His iso is small and<br>\tI'm not liking it as a whole. Discounting the read because he said he doesn't have a lot of time. I need <br>\tmore information.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Saki  </span>-\tLeaning scum.  I'm not familiar with meta, but I'm not buying \"fakeclaim=town.\" Not liking the<br>\tone-liners.

More one-liners and sarcasm.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">HP    </span>-\tUnsorted. After re-reading post #107, I noticed that I completely missed the sincerity of his tone.<br>\tI swear I read it the whole way through the first time, but I think I tunneled and subconsciously missed <br>\tthe important parts (probably due to frustration of reading through the linked game). I also like his <br>\treaction to my analysis in #163.  He seems to be having some misconceptions and I don't know if they're <br>\tintentional or not. Not liking the reasoning for his vote on HC at all. Still needs sorting because he<br>\tlikes to post giant walls of text that I tend to just skip over.

That leaves Titus and Pro hawk as other choices--for Prohawk its too early to say. I didn't pay close attention to HC or mogamma, but other apparently have them as town read which is points in their favor and Titus, well, I think I already explained that its pretty much pure gut on her--the fact notscience is voting her is points in her favor too. Brian Skies...I had him in my top town reads upon entering the game, but I feel as time's gone on, he's slowly moved into the background. You can only use 'catching up' as an excuse for so long. I initially had him up there also because he came off as friendly--I know I've mentioned this to others before, but I tend to let thongs like that cloud my judgment. <br><br>So, notscience...where to start with this guy. So, town ns is a hugely rash entity. He likes to misuse terms like 'confbias', calls himself obvtown, and typically acts like a shot/mildly scummy. In hardboiled, he outright stated he does that on purpose(side note: my actions vs ns that game were 100% legit and I would have done the same exact thing as town to prove a point). This game, however, his posts have no sense of recklessness to them. It all feels calculated. I understand he is trying to work on his skills, but this drastic a change(literally one game)...is odd to me. Moreover, I don't think he has taken a strong stance on fucking anybody all game--he cheerleadered the DB wagon from the sidelines(626), his entry post is a waffle stack. I guess I should rephrase--he took a strong stance on Titus, who as I mentioned I'm townreading. Not only that, but he had fuduzn among his strongest town reads at one point, but later recharacterizes him as 'mostly posting fluff'. It just doesn't make sense...there is no indication of his movement from Strong Town to Strong Scum. The 'amished' this is fucking stupid. He also was pushing for a Dessew lynch at one point(minor ding in his direction)."}

Brian Skies...I had him in my top town reads upon entering the game, but I feel as time's gone on, he's slowly moved into the background. You can only use 'catching up' as an excuse for so long. I initially had him up there also because he came off as friendly--I know I've mentioned this to others before, but I tend to let thongs like that cloud my judgment. <br><br>So, notscience...where to start with this guy. So, town ns is a hugely rash entity. He likes to misuse terms like 'confbias', calls himself obvtown, and typically acts like a shot/mildly scummy. In hardboiled, he outright stated he does that on purpose(side note: my actions vs ns that game were 100% legit and I would have done the same exact thing as town to prove a point). This game, however, his posts have no sense of recklessness to them. It all feels calculated. I understand he is trying to work on his skills, but this drastic a change(literally one game)...is odd to me. Moreover, I don't think he has taken a strong stance on fucking anybody all game--he cheerleadered the DB wagon from the sidelines(626), his entry post is a waffle stack. I guess I should rephrase--he took a strong stance on Titus, who as I mentioned I'm townreading. Not only that, but he had fuduzn among his strongest town reads at one point, but later recharacterizes him as 'mostly posting fluff'. It just doesn't make sense...there is no indication of his movement from Strong Town to Strong Scum. The 'amished' this is fucking stupid. He also was pushing for a Dessew lynch at one point(minor ding in his direction).</div></blockquote><br>i'm not liking his stance on Titus either.  and he was asking too many people what they thought about Dessew, it seemed to me"}

Yes, that was your next post in the thread, but a quick search tells me that you were on-site and making a substantial number of posts in the time between post #328 and #390. My hypothesis being that you waited for more support for the wagon before wanting to push it which fits the bill of cautious scum quite nicely.<br><br>P-EDIT: NS, let me actually read your case to which I have admittedly skipped due to me writing you both off a town.</div></blockquote><br>I was mostly observing to see how his perception of the game would change. I had already tried to clear up the misinterpretation earlier with HP, so I didn't understand why he was bringing it up again. As for 328, yes, that was what led me to vote for him.  <br><br>I can't explain the post differential. It could have been anything ranging from real life responsibilities to me just not paying attention to the game. Sometimes, I like to peruse the general discussion forum, I've joined multiple games, and I sometimes avoid games that give me unneeded frustration or stress (I've been lost and confused at times during this game and this is why I think Mario could be town)."}

I realize that you could be processing/reading the game more like an outsider looking in (processing reads based on what is going on in the thread) without being transparent, but therein lies the issue: transparency. It has a scum-feel in that with the way you have been moving reads flippantly, you would effectively be able to push a scum-read on just about anyone you want. Rail Tracer is probably the biggest read that has been all over the map, followed by Rebel whom you say has been moving in and out of your town-bloc but I haven't seen any indication of such, nor any reasoning.
