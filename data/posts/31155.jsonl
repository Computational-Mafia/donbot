Rules that are sorta-ish unique are bolded.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">1. I don&#8217;t tolerate ad hom wars. If your posting is merely insulting a player without providing game content, you can expect a strike from me. Three strikes, you&#8217;re out. I&#8217;m fairly lenient about this, but posting &#8220;Fuck you&#8221; over and over again is simply not acceptable. Severe issues will be reported to the list mod(s).</div><br>\n2. If I say it violates these rules, it does. You can take it up with me postgame if you wish.<br>\n3. Play towards your win condition. Gambits are fine, directly harming your own team is not.<br>\n4. Once a lynch is reached, you may continue discussion until I lock the thread. No votes or unvotes will count after a lynch has been achieved.<br>\n5. A lynch is achieved as a majority of players voting for somebody. Half is not a majority.<br>\n6. Do not quote or pretend to quote any information you get from me via PM. This includes posting your role card verbatim. Paraphrasing is fine, as are role claims naturally.<br>\n7. Do not talk about this game anywhere else, or with anyone else.<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><br>\n8. If you have family that plays mafia with you, great. However, if there&#8217;s any overlap in computer usage, please PM me before the game starts so that we don&#8217;t have any accusation of alt cheating.</div><br>\n9. Do not discuss ongoing games in this thread. This includes games on sites other than mafiascum. This also includes using [redacted] as that loophole does not fly here.<br>\n10. I am rather lenient upon activity. You must post once every 72 hours. Failure to do so will earn you a prod. Respond to your prod within 24 hours, or face replacement. Three prods is also a force replacement.<br>\n11. Day phases will be 2 weeks long. Day 1, however, will be 3 weeks long. All night phases will be 48 hours.<br>\n12. I do not require unvotes. Your vote will be counted so long as you bold it or use the vote tag. Shorthand names are fine so long as it&#8217;s clear who the vote is for.<br>\n13. If you have a question, please PM me. I&#8217;m an addict that sits around on his inbox all day anyways. If a question is something that should be answered publically, I will make a post addressing it without naming who asked it.<br>\n14. If my vote count is wrong, you can PM me or post in the thread about it.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">15. I do not fix tags or edit posts, even if you ask me to.</div><br>\n16. I reserve the right to add to these rules or modify them, but only when I post notifying all players in the game of the change.<br>\n17. Loophole abuse is all fun and games until I modkill you. Don&#8217;t try it.<br>\n18. Blue (<div style=\"display:inline;color:#0000ff\">This color</div> at #0000FF)is my color. You are welcome to use any other color of the rainbow.<br>\n19. Encryption, text hiding, and the like are silly. Don&#8217;t do it.<br>\n20. Extensions will be granted at 48 hours per replacement, up to a total duration of 6 days max per game phase.<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><br>\n21. Do not use temporary information to convey messages. This includes your signature and your avatar, but is not limited to these things.</div><br>\n<br>\nSample VT rolecard:\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>\n    Hello, Cabd, and welcome to the Cash Cabd.

After that point, I'd like to say the town made a few bad mistakes and the mafia capitalized.<br>\n<br>\nThe hydra signed their posts, but they never intended to use it as an excuse or tried to hide behind the other head (the hydra was town by the way).

The mafia used this to their advantage.<br>\n<br>\nThe hydra did post under the wrong account several times, but seeing as how it was a relatively short game, I don't see this being an issue.  A little more work from the teammates should make up for this shortcoming.  People are human after all.  We all make mistakes.  I'm new to this game, but iso seems to be a tool for scumhunting, townreading, and analyzing information in a quick and efficient manner, but not a necessity to properly play the game.  Kind of like using a calculator.<br>\n<br>\nI don't see a problem with a hydra making it to lylo.  How is this any different from another player/slot making it to lylo?<br>\n<br>\nYes, the hydra screwed lylo by placing a vote on a town member.  But is this a mistake that only hydras make?  Or is it common between all players, regardless of player/slot type?<br>\n<br>\nWhy should it matter if they had no problems about it?  The game was already over at that point.

Mafia is an inherently antagonistic game.  As players get a better feel for who may be on their team, cooperation is possible, but page 1 is not usually when town-recognition happens among players who don't know each other really, really well, especially not mass-town-recognition.

The only problem I can see is the term usage. SoS didn't have any concrete town reads, but he did have \"leaning\" town reads. It was obvious that these were the ones he felt most comfortable with because of their placement on the list. RWaP's list was completely different in that it didn't label anyone as scum. But it's pretty obvious who the hydra suspects most. <br>\n<br>\nAs for me, this is just how I write my reads list. I use quantifiers because I don't believe in absolutes when dealing with the unknown (ingrained into me from philosophy and English courses). That's just the way I am and it isn't indicative for me. If you are still having a problem with my list, just assume that any read with the word town is someone I believe to be innocent and anyone with the word scum in the read to be someone I believe to be scum. If I'm fencesitting for whatever reason, the read will just read as \"null.\"<br>\n<br>\nRegarding the last part, this isn't what I said and you know it. Creating a townblock is just another strategy that people may use. This creates an inner circle of trust and allows the players in the inner circle to create more pressure for the players outside of the circle. When the town circle is big enough, it makes it much more difficult for scum to avoid the pressure and makes it easier to catch them. Am I saying this is the most effective strategy? No. What I am saying is that this is a strategy that players may decide to use when they have really strong, mutual townreads. But if a scum does find a way in, then the strategy becomes moot.<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5310918#p5310918\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5310918#p5310918\" data-post-id=\"5310918\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 394</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=12137\">Humble Poirot</a> wrote:</cite>As for your DB vote, do you realize you seem to have a pattern where you just follow the current trend?

If the game or his role features unusual mechanics he looks more engaged right off the bat.  This being a mini normal game, I wouldn't expect to see that in his day 1 play.

Don't like that one bit. <br>\n<br>\nBrian Skies is mostly POE(shitty, I know), but I like SoS, you, kitty, nacho, Cephrir. That leaves Titus and Pro hawk as other choices--for Prohawk its too early to say. I didn't pay close attention to HC or mogamma, but other apparently have them as town read which is points in their favor and Titus, well, I think I already explained that its pretty much pure gut on her--the fact notscience is voting her is points in her favor too. Brian Skies...I had him in my top town reads upon entering the game, but I feel as time's gone on, he's slowly moved into the background. You can only use 'catching up' as an excuse for so long. I initially had him up there also because he came off as friendly--I know I've mentioned this to others before, but I tend to let thongs like that cloud my judgment. <br>\n<br>\nSo, notscience...where to start with this guy. So, town ns is a hugely rash entity. He likes to misuse terms like 'confbias', calls himself obvtown, and typically acts like a shot/mildly scummy. In hardboiled, he outright stated he does that on purpose(side note: my actions vs ns that game were 100% legit and I would have done the same exact thing as town to prove a point). This game, however, his posts have no sense of recklessness to them. It all feels calculated. I understand he is trying to work on his skills, but this drastic a change(literally one game)...is odd to me. Moreover, I don't think he has taken a strong stance on fucking anybody all game--he cheerleadered the DB wagon from the sidelines(626), his entry post is a waffle stack. I guess I should rephrase--he took a strong stance on Titus, who as I mentioned I'm townreading. Not only that, but he had fuduzn among his strongest town reads at one point, but later recharacterizes him as 'mostly posting fluff'. It just doesn't make sense...there is no indication of his movement from Strong Town to Strong Scum. The 'amished' this is fucking stupid.

Moreover, I don't think he has taken a strong stance on fucking anybody all game--he cheerleadered the DB wagon from the sidelines(626), his entry post is a waffle stack. I guess I should rephrase--he took a strong stance on Titus, who as I mentioned I'm townreading. Not only that, but he had fuduzn among his strongest town reads at one point, but later recharacterizes him as 'mostly posting fluff'.

Yes, that was your next post in the thread, but a quick search tells me that you were on-site and making a substantial number of posts in the time between post #328 and #390. My hypothesis being that you waited for more support for the wagon before wanting to push it which fits the bill of cautious scum quite nicely.<br>\n<br>\nP-EDIT: NS, let me actually read your case to which I have admittedly skipped due to me writing you both off a town.</div></blockquote>\nI was mostly observing to see how his perception of the game would change. I had already tried to clear up the misinterpretation earlier with HP, so I didn't understand why he was bringing it up again. As for 328, yes, that was what led me to vote for him.  <br>\n<br>\nI can't explain the post differential. It could have been anything ranging from real life responsibilities to me just not paying attention to the game.

I realize that you could be processing/reading the game more like an outsider looking in (processing reads based on what is going on in the thread) without being transparent, but therein lies the issue: transparency. It has a scum-feel in that with the way you have been moving reads flippantly, you would effectively be able to push a scum-read on just about anyone you want. Rail Tracer is probably the biggest read that has been all over the map, followed by Rebel whom you say has been moving in and out of your town-bloc but I haven't seen any indication of such, nor any reasoning. I also felt it in the way you categorized my slot first as town-leaning and then as potential scum. The Brian Skies read is also odd to me considering you didn't join to help me push him at all, despite him being in your scum-pile.

I liked how SoS/Rebel played and yet, If I mod a game, I'd still ban hydras (Having people name heads and confusing things all around is annoying).  RT doesn't count since he played on his own and I didn't like AK.  I'm explaining this just in case anyone has forgotten how this game started.
