I am Substrike22, and I will be your moderator for the next few months.  As this is a mini normal game, there will be minimal flavor, and any flavor will be \"vanilla\" and will not contain any relevant game information.  ANY flavor included is included purely by the fact that I am a creative writer and occasionally like to find creative ways to tell stories.  A game of mafia, underneath it all, is a story unfolding.  Therefore I may stage a game in given setting, but this setting will not have any impact on the game itself, other than providing imagry and a plot for you to enjoy.<br><br>Below are my rules.<br>Rules:<br>1.  Rule one of mafia.  You don't talk about mafia.<br>2.  No land wars in Russia.<br><br>Real rules:  <br>(Copied and edited from Reckamonic, with their permission.  Original set of rules belonged to Vi.)<br><br>1) <span style=\"font-style: italic\">Starting and Ending States:</span>  The game starts during the Day.  All roles that can communicate at Night may do during pregame, but not during the day, unless otherwise specified in your role PM.  (If this is a normal game, there will be no day quicktopic.  Period.)  The game will end when one faction has fulfilled its win condition, unless otherwise specified.<br>2) <span style=\"font-style: italic\">Day Procedures:</span>  Each player may discuss the game and cast a single vote at a time against people they want to lynch.  Day ends when either the deadline hits or a strict majority of the votes are on one person.<br>3) <span style=\"font-style: italic\">Voting:</span>  Votes should be in <span class=\"noboldsig\">bold</span> AND AT THE START OF A NEW LINE in order for them to count, for instance: <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: Substrike22</span>.  <br><br>If you wish to vote for a different player, it helps the mod if you unvote, but is is not required.  As long as I can tell who you're voting for, I don't care if you abbreviate someone's name when you vote them.<br>4) <span style=\"font-style: italic\">No Lynch:</span>  As an alternative to voting for someone, you may <span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: No Lynch</span>, but for it to take effect, enough players must vote No Lynch that it would be impossible to form any other majority.<br>5) <span style=\"font-style: italic\">Deadlines:</span>  Deadline will be 3 weeks.<br>6) <span style=\"font-style: italic\">Mass Inactivity:</span>  I may shorten the deadline if I deem the activity level is unsatisfactory. You will be warned if I  want you fellows to pick up the pace.<br>7) <span style=\"font-style: italic\">Deadline Lynches:</span>  If no single player has enough votes for a lynch at the deadline, the result is <span class=\"noboldsig\">No Lynch</span> and the game proceeds to Night.  Deadlines are there for a reason.<br><br>8) <span style=\"font-style: italic\">Twilight:</span> After someone receives the majority vote, everyone may still discuss the game, but votes and unvotes will not be considered - the person voted for by the majority will be lynched regardless. Twilight will last until we waltz in and post a death scene.<br><br>9) <span style=\"font-style: italic\">Night Length and Procedures:</span>  The topic will be locked at Night.  If your Role PM specifies that you have a Night Action, you may follow the instructions on that PM to use it. Barring extenuating circumstances, Nights will not last longer than 72 hours, but will not be shorter than 48.<br>10) <span style=\"font-style: italic\">Night Action Resubmission:</span> If you have to PM a choice to the mods (i.e. the name of someone you want to kill/protect/investigate), you may change your choice at any time during the Night by sending the mod another PM with the new choice.  The most recent choice will be honored.  Note, if you change your mind, your place \"in line\" for rule 11 is also reset.<br>11) <span style=\"font-style: italic\">Role Overlap Policy:</span>  In the event of overlapping and/or contradictory Night Actions (i.e. a mutual roleblock), priority is given to whoever PMs the mods with the action first. However, if two kills are submitted on the same target, the most damaging death will be the one displayed (You can slit someone's throat first, but if he got blown to smithereens no one will care about his throat...). Finally, if two vote modifying actions affect you, the lower amount takes priority.  <span class=\"noboldsig\">If this is a non-theme game, note that the flavor involved with a death doesn't actually matter, and therefore I will defer to the order in which the kills are submitted, not the death that is \"most damaging.\"</span><br><br>12) <span style=\"font-style: italic\">Bolding Stuff:</span>  Bolding something is how you get the mod to notice it.  It's that simple.  I will not read text that is not bolded.<br>13) <span style=\"font-style: italic\">Mod Color:</span>  If the mod needs to edit your post, it will be done in <span style=\"color: blue\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span style=\"font-style: italic\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">blue,</span></span></span></span> italicized and bolded.  Don't impersonate me.  This is modkillable.<br>14) <span style=\"font-style: italic\">Activity, Prods, and Replacements:</span>  You will be prodded if three days have passed since your last post.  You will be replaced if you do not post after another two days, or if you need to be prodded three times throughout the game.  If you know ahead of time that you will not be able to participate for at least 48 hours, go ahead and announce it in-thread so nobody (such as <span style=\"font-style: italic\">the mod</span>) thinks you're lurking.  We reserve the right to blacklist flakers or people who maliciously replace out.<br>15) <span style=\"font-style: italic\">\"Last Words\" for replacements:</span>  If you request replacement, you may PM me a message that you would like to have passed on to the person who replaces you.<br>16) <span style=\"font-style: italic\">\"Bah!\" Posts:</span> If your player slot is killed off, it's probably because people don't want you around. Unless your role specifically states you can keep talking/voting/play parcheesi with us, you are allowed one informationless \"bah\" post and then scram til endgame. Special mechanics can of course overlap.<br>17) <span style=\"font-style: italic\">Outside Discussion:</span>  Don't discuss this game outside of this thread with anyone unless your Role PM lets you do otherwise.<br>18) <span style=\"font-style: italic\">Post Edition:</span> Editing or deleting posts is not allowed (and usually not possible).  Doublepost with your changes instead.<br>19) <span style=\"font-style: italic\">Mod and PM quoting:</span>  You may not, at any time, quote your role PM.  If you do, you will be modkilled, and your faction will be significantly penalized.  If, at any point, a quicktopic is shared, everyone in that quicktopic will be modkilled to preserve the integrity of the game.  This includes Masons, Mafia Members, or other factions.  This means that if, for any reason (accidental or malicious), a Mafia quicktopic is posted, the Mafia will be modkilled and lose the game.<br>20) <span style=\"font-style: italic\">Modkills:</span> Breaking any of the above three rules (or flagrantly violating Rule 16) will result in you getting modkilled.  Modkills can be retroactive.  If a living player breaks any of these rules, the day may or may not end, depending on what would disadvantage that player's faction the most.  A dead player breaking any of these rules will result in someone from the same faction getting modkilled.  In addition, getting modkilled results in an instant loss for that player, along with my general hatred. In short, follow the rules.  I will keep a blacklist.<br><br>21) <span style=\"font-style: italic\">Win Mentality:</span> Play to win.  Failure to do so will result in rule 20 being used.<br>22) <span style=\"font-style: italic\">Policy:</span> Have fun.  Or else.  And remember, it's a game - keep it classy and don't take things personally; everyone's doing what they have to to win."}

But this is a problem -- you only get <span style=\"font-style: italic\">a few</span> good reads. RVS is not random for the scum (and not terribly random for the town, if players are choosing who to vote based on who does or does not have an impending bandwagon on them). Because the scum know who their partners are, they can steer the momentum of RVS away from their partners and toward townies. They can thus avoid having to answer to the pressure of a D-1 bandwagon; or, they can ensure that they or their partner endures an early D-1 bandwagon, just so they can point to that for town-credibility, but then re-direct the bandwagon momentum onto someone else. The point is, the uninformed town can be manipulated by the scum without even knowing they are being manipulated; and even those being bandwagoned early on can know that it is only RVS and that they should not worry too much. The reads you end up getting may not be good, and they almost certainly will be limited to the few who actively participated in RVS (by either enduring a bandwagon or taking a stand on someone else's bandwagon).<br><br>I prefer RQS because the underlying assumption is that everyone has to answer the questions. Everyone participates and gets their responses and opinions out in the open, and no one can avoid having to take an early stand on some semi-relevant question.<br><br>RVS and RQS are not mutually exclusive, and most games with an RQS element will also have some degree of RVS. And early votes in RQS are fine, as long as there is a modicum of justification beyond simple bandwagoning. The questioning in RQS is supposed to provide that modicum of justification. This is why RVS is bad vis-a-vis RQS, in my opinion."}

You then identify \"two more appeals that get ignored\" (ignored for what? I assume you mean ignored for being scum tells; is this assumption incorrect?). You identify those two appeals as Appeal to Logic and Appeal to Authority. Thus, if my assumption in the parentheses is correct, then you are identifying Appeal to Logic and Appeal to Authority as being scum tells.<br><br>You then \"call it AtL and lynch this scum.\" So you accuse me of exhibiting a scum tell, which you call AtL, and you exhort the town to lynch me, \"this scum.\"<br><br>I suspect that you are confused on the definition of an appeal to logic. An appeal to logic is a sound, well-constructed argument that is free of logical fallacies such as appeals to emotion or appeals to authority (or any of the myriad other fallacies out there). So you essentially accused me of well-argued logic and are using this accusation to indict me as scum. Thus; the link in your argument between logic and scum.</div></blockquote><br>Did you not read my post to krew about how AtE is only a scum tell in context that makes it scummy?<br><br>Also your definition of an appeal to logic is shit. Appeals can be bad. That's what makes AtE scummy more often than AtE or AtA. It's stupid to AtE in a game like this whereas AtL is the entire game.

Secret Project is accusing you of shifting over to more refined/sophisticated posting to seem more pro-town. He calls it \"Appeal to Logic\" which is a terrible name in my opinion.</div></blockquote><br>An \"Appeal to Logic\" isn't a term Secret Project just coined. It is an expression with an already well-established definition. I gave Secret Project the opportunity to correct his definition and/or refine his accusation against me; in other words, he could have said what you just said (\" shifting over to more refined/sophisticated posting to seem more pro-town\") or to what WormyKrew said earlier (\"Iron is trying to <span style=\"font-style: italic\">appear</span> as if he's being logical, and using this appearance to manipulate us\"). He chose to continue with his original assertion. Therefore, I think I understand the case on me pretty well. It is bogus, and is a possible indication that Secret Project's scum-hunting is bogus.<br><br>To press the point on Secret Project's scum-hunting; his level of aggression is fine, as it would certainly produce pressure on scum. But he is far too indiscriminate -- if <span style=\"font-style: italic\">everyone</span> is a suspect, then <span style=\"font-style: italic\">no one</span> is a suspect. How are any of us supposed to feel pressure when he casts an accusation when there are (at last count) three other suspects whom he has indicted? But it certainly creates the <span style=\"font-style: italic\">appearance</span> that he is a bold, hard-charging scum-hunter. There's just no substance to his argument. That, coupled with his bizarre exclamation that grouped everyone (including, presumably, himself) as a scum puts him head and shoulders above the crowd in terms of a level of suspicion.<br><br>One final point -- I think I have built a strong enough argument to invalidate your dismissal of my justification as simply OMGUS. If I responded to his vote on me by casting a vote on him without further justification, I think we would all agree that it was OMGUS. By disparaging the case I've built as OMGUS, you are disparaging the substance of the argument unfairly. Why would you do that?"}

The issue of whether or not he is scumhunting is separate from the issue of whether or not he is AtEing. I contend that he is not scumhunting effectively, and he has AtE'd. Your response to this is no, he has not AtE'd (post #189) <span style=\"font-style: italic\">because</span> he is scumhunting (post #191). This is a non-sequitur. And your defense of Secret Project seems to me to be unnecessary.<br><br>And what the heck is an Appeal to Contradiction?

What?</div></blockquote><br>You just answered your own point; in the first summation, I note that on the whole you are overly aggressive. On the second quote, I note that your level of aggression is fine, <span style=\"font-style: italic\">but</span> you are too indiscriminate. You separated the second and third parts into two different quotes, and then incorrectly identified the third part as a \"completely DIFFERENT point\" when in fact it clearly linked to the second point. I thought it was pretty obvious that the third part (\"far too indiscriminate\") was integral to the argument being made in the second part (\"level of aggression is fine\") -- especially as he left out the clause linking the two parts: \"his level of aggression is fine, <span style=\"font-style: italic\">as it would certainly produce pressure on scum</span>. But he is far too indiscriminate....\"<br><br>By leaving out that part, he built a straw-man argument by severing the second and third parts of the quote. I have now leveled justified accusations of Appealing to Emotion and Straw Man argumentation. I think these are enough to justify putting more votes on him. I also think Krew ought to let Secret Project defend himself, and not leap to his defense with faulty argumentation of his own.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Secret Project wrote:</cite>No, because you didn't listen the last time I said AtE isn't a scum tell in every context.</div></blockquote><br>I tried to listen when you brought this point up (post #149). In post #153 I asked you to point out where you told Krew that AtE isn't a scum tell in every context, because I couldn't find it on this board. Could you please point it out to me? I don't think it exists -- not on this board, at least."}

It's like a corporation bogging you down in paper work so that a trial can't progress and you don't get your damages.

Ideally, the arguer employs an appeal to logic. If he does not, he employs one of a myriad of fallacies -- many, but not all, begin with the word \"appeal.\" An appeal is not inherently fallacious -- as appeal to logic is not fallacious.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Secret Project wrote:</cite>Secondly, you're thing on my \"u so silleh\" post is ridiculous as IIRC I then responded to your claim of us not scumhunting AFTER that, meaning your \"AtE\" case is just a bit silly, don't you agree?</div></blockquote><br>The rest of your argument consisted of: \"Y'know, the way we've scumhunted. <span class=\"noboldsig\">When we (my partner more often) says someone \"is scum\" it puts pressure on them to answer that</span>. If you post a few paragraphs every single post about why someone might be scum that simply doesn't work.\" The only part of this that can be construed as a sound defense is the bolded part. If my argument against you had simply been \"calling people scum does not put pressure on them,\" then you would have responded (however weakly) to my entire argument in that single sentence. But my argument against your scum-hunting was:<br><blockquote><div><cite>Ironhead wrote:</cite>It appears to me that Secret Project is being overly aggressive in his attempts to appear as if he is a scum-hunter. I haven't yet seen him construct a lucid argument demonstrating that someone is acting scummy; what I <span style=\"font-style: italic\">have</span> seen him do is cast weakly supported accusations at a total of four players, followed by an exclamation that everyone in the game must be scum. This is not helpful; nor is his habit of addressing his suspects as \"scum.\"</div></blockquote><br>In short:<br>1. You haven't constructed a lucid argument demonstrating that someone is acting scummy;<br>2. You have cast weakly supported accusations at a total of four players;<br>3. You exclaimed everyone is scum.<br><br>I then conclude that this is not helpful. <span style=\"font-style: italic\">As an addendum</span>, I also note that your habit of addressing your suspects as \"scum\" is not helpful either. If you want to perceive this as part of the accusation against you, then fine -- but it is still incumbent upon you to respond to the entire argument.<br><br>So your response weakly addressed the issue of calling people scum, but ignored the balance of the argument against you. You dismissed it with an Appeal to Ridicule."}

Trust your instincts in this regard. But I do not recommend pressing a case on someone based solely on a gut feeling -- if you don't have something concrete to present to other players to persuade them of your case, you're not going to get the player lynched."}

It was more of the ramblings on inside of my head. 2-There is a possibility you could be a pr and any more discussion about it would only bring more attention to yourself.

I read this as \"I didn't filter out anything that might be scummy before I typed it, and I now regret typing it.\" This might be true, but it does not make you any less scummy. The only thing that might be pro-town is your alleged concern that DarthYoshi might be a PR, and so your willingness \"to just let it slide.\" But I'm not sure that even this is pro-town -- if DarthYoshi's response made you think that he might be a PR, then (a) others may have drawn the same conclusion, so it is too late to sweep it under the rug; and (b) your post really did operate as a rolefish, whether you intended it to do so or not.<br><br>In post #288, mastin2 indicates that he finds it unlikely that both hydras are town. I agree; but whereas mastin2 has focused on WormyKrew, I think Secret Project is the more likely of the two hydras to be scum, due (partly) to flaws I see in his scum-hunting and (mostly) to his fallacious responses to the accusations leveled against him. However, it is very easy for me to see WormyKrew as scum -- his buddying up to Secret Project and chainsaw defense of him come immediately to mind. I am also suspicious of the way he quickly concluded that Secret Project was town, and then tried to protect him from pressure.<br><br>Secret Project, what is your opinion of WormyKrew?"}

I want to rephrase my thoughts on Ironhead/Secret Project. I think Ironhead is right in the argument.  This game is 100% about appeals to something. Appeals to logic, appeals to emotion, appeals to authority. All of those appeals can be used by BOTH scum and town. From Ironhead town pov, I can see him raging at Secret Project because from a quick read-through it looks like Secret Project is trying to \"fos him\" for appealing to logic, when in reality logic is the strongest part of the game.<br><br>Now, I don't really blame Secret Project for pointing out appeal to authority as a possible \"scumtell\". I don't view it as much of a scumtell as I view it as something that would be dangerous for a scum-sided player to have. If scum can establish their authority early on it can cause lots of problems for town for obvious reasons. I feel that this was what he was getting at maybe? The arrogance/appeal to authority/whatever you want to call it is in itself a big fat null tell though.<br><br>I think Ironhead vs Secret Project is very possibly Town v. Town and we shouldn't lynch either.<br><br>jilynne, essentially I believe you are town because I believe your newbie tells. People view your politeness and not wanting to pressure people as potential scum, but they are forgetting (or ignoring) the fact you are a teenage girl and your behavior very likely matches your personality. Derp. No offense intended. And yea, once you claimed it becomes even more obv that you are town.<br><br>On page 8, will post once ore on page 12 and then a recap.

I've played with a few of you in the past and it's nice to see some new faces as well. With the exception of my replace in and catch-up post we won't be posting separately, instead we will be discussing our thoughts in our QT prior to posting thus there will be no need to sign our posts. I know this post is going to seem unbelievably long however I urge everyone to read the entirety of it and state what they have agreement or disagreement with. <br><br>The amount of discussion based around the advantages and disadvantages of the RVS and the RQS in this game is appalling. Players thoughts and opinions on both of these would be decided before entering the game and recieving their role meaning their stances are unallignment indicative. Futhermore attempting to attack a player because of their ability to use English is infuriatingly bad, if you were to read through just one of Ironheads town games you will notice his use of language is highly similar thus not an allignment related tell. I also strongly dislike the fact that it's being pushed that at least one of the town hydras has to be scum due to interactions becuase it's not the case at all, the only thing that interactions between them show is that they're not scum together. <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">I do need to hear from TheWayItEnds and Ironhead more before I can attain a read on any of them so: Ironhead and TheWayItEnds I want you all to state your thoughts on the WormyKrew wagon at the moment as well as if you feel it's scum or town propelled. </span><br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Town Reads:</span></span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Captain Corporal:</span>His predecessors actions before replacing out read as a geninue attempt at scumhunting and leaving information for his partner, Captains disagreement with his predecessors reads is something that mafia generally would avoid doing, as is openely asking for players reads and thoughts on their slot.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Secret Project:</span>The strength and aggression they showed about their reads earlier in the day reads as a geninue belief that they're correct. Their reaction to Jils claim and their actions following it is something I have massive trouble seeing them do as scum.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Wormy Krew:</span> I'm not seeing the case against them. The slip is semantics and is being pushed to the point where it's becoming a joke. Their hydra disagreements read as legitimate and there are many alternate places where they would place their vote as scum in this position. Their play also shows no ressemblance to Sleepys scum game, I suggest reading through <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=11&amp;t=17314\" class=\"postlink\">Newbie 1098</a> to notice the massive differences in his play. I do dislike the fact that they have quietened down recently and would like them to explain and move their vote.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Mastin2: </span>]I'm finding this read slightly difficult to explain, part of it has to do with Flinters actions however minimal they are the rest has to do with his prevention and redirection of the attention towards DY and Alduskkel which I really like.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Monk: </span>Similar to Mastin I'm finding this hard to explain and it's probably a read I will have to revist at some point but his most recent post mentioning a document going missing reads as a slight-town tell as keeping notes or documents about a game is something I generally do as town but not scum.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Null Reads:</span></span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Jilynne1991: </span>Something that should probably be brought to light is the fact that she's not a new player, she's an alternate account of another player at this site. Proof of this is <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3086580#p3086580\" class=\"postlink\">here</a> though you'll need to attain access to Forum 62 to read it. I'm reading her play this game as an overexaggeration of her false newbie status and if you read her 'town slip' knowing she's not new it reads as highly suspicious. I however am apprehensive over lynching her at the current moment due to her claim, I'm willing to leave her to the side until tommorow.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Alduskkel</span>: I intensely dislike his lack of content in this game especially for someone as experienced as he is, though I'm unsure if I would consider the lack of content a scum-tell for him especially considering he openely stated he prefers to be scum, therefore would be more inclined to perform better as it.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Scum Reads:</span></span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">WeirdAlex</span>: His play is exceedingly different to what I've seen from him in the previous game we played together and it's not because he's more experienced now, he's fencesat on nearly all of his suspicions and spent more time attempting to coach and assist Jilynne in the game than scumhunt himself. One thing I am positive on though is that if WeirdAlex or Jilynne ever flip scum the other is confirmed town.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">DarthYoshi</span>: Although he started the game very active his posts decreased in quantity and quality to the point where he voted Wormy to gain a reaction while saying he's aiming for a reaction in the same post as the vote. This removes the entire point of the pressure vote and reads as opportunistic voting. I do have one qualm about this read though, I've observed one of his previous scum games and from memory he played remarkably differently so this reads is certaintly open to change.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Elsa </span>: I don't doubt that she's busy due to university finals however I believe she's exaggerating how much of a hinderance that is on her performance in this game. A game just finished very recently in which she put forward a massive amount of effort to it in comparison to this game. She also contradicts herself by stating that she was most suspicious of both of the hydras however earlier in the game she stated she was fairly positive that Secret Project was clean (town)."}

WormyKrew attracted my attention early with his buddying to Secret Project, as well as his insistence on defending Secret Project from my accusations because he allegedly thought he was town (why not let Secret Project defend himself and demonstrate that he is town? Or wither under pressure and make you question your read? Etc).

When scum replace in they can pick any wagon they want because they have a clean slate and don't have to worry about contradicting themselves. And why would scum avoid asking about reads on their own slot? Scum are the most concerned about what others think of them, if they can get away with asking then that's great for them.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Soben wrote:</cite>One thing I am positive on though is that if WeirdAlex or Jilynne ever flip scum the other is confirmed town.</div></blockquote>Why?<br>---<br>Mastin is really frustrating me, but if he posts his damn reads and his reasoning too by the end of the weekend I'll forgive him some.<br><br>Speaking of lack of content, I am seriously going to try and ramp up my posting frequency/content in this game.

Isn't that your beloved chainsaw defense?</div></blockquote><br>I agree that it was odd how Secret Project went from accusing me of being scum to \"probtown\" without ever demonstrating how he arrived at that conclusion. But I don't think you can accuse him of chainsaw defense for two important reasons: first, accusing him (or anyone) of chainsaw defense implies that the player being defended is scum. Until someone flips scum, that is a problematic conclusion to make. Second, it ignores the fact that you and Secret Project were teaming up to accuse me of scumminess early on as I built a case on Secret Project. If you can characterize Secret Project's current attack on you as chainsaw, then couldn't I do the same to characterize your attack on me when Secret Project and I were going at it?<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>WormyKrew wrote:</cite>Jily, this whole thing about you being an alt is... weird. I honestly don't know what to do about this. Can't we ask an admin to do an IP check or something? </div></blockquote><br>I think doing an IP check is way out of bounds, and an absurd request to make to site admins. You ought to be able to find scum using your wits; suggesting we ask to do an IP check is bizarre and does not seem townish to me.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>WormyKrew wrote:</cite>And this all leads to Ironhead</div></blockquote><br>I disagree with this conclusion. Based on the issues I mentioned above, I think your argument requires a little more work. I also suspect that you have drawn the conclusion first (\"Ironhead must be scum!\") and then fit the argument to match your conclusion. You are declaring that you have re-read the thread, and after re-examining the evidence have concluded that <span style=\"font-style: italic\">the same person</span> is scum whom you have been accusing since the game started; I am unconvinced that you did a re-read with an open mind. Use the re-read as an opportunity to re-question your assumptions, find new arguments, and construct a stronger argument against someone being scum.<br><br>Having said all that, I will note that your post is far from being the scummiest on this page. That dubious honor goes to:<br><blockquote><div><cite>mastin2 wrote:</cite>Lol.<br><br>No, seriously.<br><br>Just...lol.<br><br>I don't know what in that post makes me laugh, but it's just extremely lolworthy.

And there is nothing else in this post except AtE -- no additional argumentation of any kind. Why did mastin2 respond to WormyKrew's argument with an Appeal to Emotion?<br><br>Mastin2, please respond in your next post with exactly what you find so humorous about WormyKrew's post."}

For the love of God, post SOMETHING rather than \"I don't know, but I think you might be scum because my gut says\" or \"I have no reads because no one questions me\".<br><br>Speaking of which, why for the love of [redacted] (&lt; Am I doing that right?) would you get reads from <span style=\"font-style: italic\">other people questioning <span class=\"noboldsig\">you</span></span>?<br><br><br>Next up, SleepyKrew is a mislynch. I'm pretty sure I already said this in this post, but I can't find it, shoot me xD<br><br>Looking back, I'm disappointed that I so easily went \"oh yarp krew is so scummeh\". All of his latest posts scream town. Speaking of which, wierd, your \"slip\" on Elsa is not a slip. Forgetting about a read can be from two things:<br><br>A). Being a Cop<br>B). ...Forgetting the read<br><br>Seriously. It's actually generally more often a Towntell than a Scumtell as Scum would be ridiculously careful to <span style=\"font-style: italic\">not</span> forget about a read. If you think about, the posts were 230 posts apart of something, and it's very possible to forget a read having not been there for a while. Think of it as playing Zelda (It's easy to assume you've played OoT from your avatar/location) and not playing it for a few days (blasphemy, I know). You come back to it, and you load up the game and then you stand there for a sec. Then you think \"Wait, where the hell was I meant to be going?\" Even though you recently played the game and you should know something that obvious it can slip your mind. Bad comparison, but you get my drift."}

Has been reasonable in his examination of and argumentation against Elsa and Secret Project.<br><br>5. jilynne1991: Strong scum vibe, I think she is overplaying the helpless 13-yr old card -- but I agree that due to her (unprovoked) role-claim, we ought to give her some time to demonstrate that she is who she claims -- at least unless or until a counter-claim.<br><br>6. TheWayItEnds: Tough to say; has one townish post to his credit (ISO #8, wherein he challenged Scumhunter), but with only nine total posts I don't think he is leaning town. The lack of posts lends itself toward scumminess in my opinion. His last post promised more activity, so I intend to refine my read of him thereafter.<br><br>7. DarthYoshi: Strong town vibe. He has seemed relaxed and forthcoming, even under pressure. Has been useful for generating discussion.<br><br>8. monk / future replacement: Leaning scum. But with so few posts, it is tough to solidify a read.<br><br>9. Secret Project: Strong scum vibe. I have pointed out his AtE issues and his attempts at scumhunting have not been useful, leading me to believe that it is all for show. His views of me and WormKrew seem to float along with the prevailing winds -- from scum to town and back again, with little explanation as to why he thinks the way he does.<br><br>11. Alduskkel: Leaning town. I have liked his detailed posting.<br><br>12. mastin2: Leaning town, due mostly due to his passionate opinions and his seeming willingness to let the chips fall where they may in this regard. On the other hand, his recent AtE and his semi-coherent string of posts last night are not townish.<br><br>13. WormyKrew: Strong scum vibe. I have detailed some of the scumminess I see in him, and expect to be able to identify more. I am struggling to find anything that is intrinsically townish in what he has said so far."}

If you want one, here you go:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>WormyKrew wrote:</cite>If you think someone is town, you defend them, chainsaw or otherwise. It is SP who said a chainsaw is indicative of scum, and SP has chainsawed.</div></blockquote><br>This comment shows a misunderstanding of what a chainsaw defense is. If a town thinks someone else is town, they might defend that player by addressing the accusations against him; they would not defend him by attacking his accuser (unless they think the accuser is scum, in which case the attack on the accuser is motivated by a scum-read and not by a defense of the town-read player).<br><br>The concept of the chainsaw defense is that a scum attacks another player because that player is accusing the scum's partner of scumminess. So the person making the chainsaw defense does not \"think someone is town\" as you say; he <span style=\"font-style: italic\">knows</span> the alignment of the person being defended, and he knows that alignment is scum.<br><br>Until someone flips scum, we don't know if any one player's accusation on anyone else represents a chainsaw defense; so I am curious as to how you seem to know before any flips that what SP is doing is a chainsaw defense.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>WormyKrew wrote:</cite>Out of bounds? If jily is an alt, and considering the amount of games she's in, then she would probably be breaking site rules. It's worth a look IMO.</div></blockquote><br>Yes, if she is breaking site rules then certainly an admin would want to get involved. This is something that an admin would have to do (not a mod, as jil suggested). And I think the correct procedure would be for a mod to discreetly notify an admin in a way that is invisible to us players and allows us to continue the game under the assumption that jil is not cheating.<br><br>But this is not what you suggested. You said \"Can't we ask an admin to do an IP check or something? Because if jily is new or not is very important.\" What you seem to be suggesting is that we players take it into our own hands to investigate this by contacting an admin and requesting an IP check so that we can confirm jil is scum. This is out of bounds.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>WormyKrew wrote:</cite>You tell me I re-read wrong. Then you tell me how to re-read properly. Well, let's see.<br>Re-question assumptions: Is mastin ever going to supply reasons?<br>New arguments: Jily<br>Stronger Argument: On you. My other scumspects all have a direct relation to you.</div></blockquote><br>You bring up a good point about mastin2 (although in your post #526, your mention of mastin2 was almost an afterthought, after presenting weak cases on SP and jil). You don't offer much of a new argument on jil, but I think you are on the right track in terms of her being a suspect -- but checking her IP address is absolutely not a scumhunting technique. Your case on me is not a \"stronger argument,\" it is an appeal to possibility in that you discern a tenuous link between the two players against whom you have presented weak cases and me.<br><br>I continue to be unconvinced that your alleged re-read yielded any new insights for you. It appears to me that you merely reinforced your opinions; that is why I didn't dignify your post #554 with a response until now."}

Either you think weakly pushing a mislynch is scummy, or you don\u2019t.  You seem overly concerned with how your voting is viewed.<br><br>I\u2019m still not getting the side-dish sort of focus on Jily.  We\u2019re not lynching her today.  It\u2019s that simple.  If she is what she says she is, her role is very easily confirmable.  If she isn\u2019t what she says she is, we can throw her into death stew later on fairly easily.  (Side note, I think her observation about Capt Corporal in #540 is a decent one, especially since Corporal\u2019s response in #542 is all kinds of awful\u2014there\u2019s nothing to push for, mate?  Yeah, there is\u2014the lynching of scumz.)<br><br>SP\u2019s #550: If by \u201cthe unanimous \u2018Darth is scum,\u201d you mean you and Mastin, then yeah.  What I want to know is why you are so adamant in agreeing with Mastin that I am scum when in that very same post, you\u2019re tearing Mastin a new one for pretty much the same reasons I have been all game\u2014posting craploads of fluff, not explaining anything, etc.  Also, what exactly about WK\u2019s recent posts (and I want specific examples) \u201cscream\u201d town to you?  Whichever head wrote those words is the head I want answering that question; I don\u2019t care if you two are split on him.<br><br>WK\u2019s #554-56 look more like a player attempting to appear helpful than a player who is, you know, actually being helpful.<br><br>Mastin\u2019s #559-61: Please explain why you can\u2019t support the Elsa wagon (ie, why is Elsa town?) <br><br>WK\u2019s #564: It\u2019s called buddying.<br><br>Corporal\u2019s #566: How about actually responding to Mastin\u2019s content as opposed to stating, basically, fluff?<br><br>Jily\u2019s #573: Why is Alex leaning town to you?<br><br>Alduskkel\u2019s #582: Your response to me was an overreaction or overcompensation, imo.<br><br>Ironhead\u2019s #594: How has Alex\u2019s interactions with SP and Elsa demonstrated towniness? (As an aside, I\u2019m fairly convinced that the Alex-Elsa interactions cannot be a bus; I\u2019m thinking that if one flips scum, the other is probtown.)  Also, please elaborate your town read on Alduskkel.<br><br>Mastin\u2019s #597: First, why are you spoilering absolutely everything now?  Second, you came into the game with me as your #1 scumread, but now the only reason I\u2019m scum is PoE?  WTF?  Also, PoE is at its weakest on D1\u2014it becomes far more useful as the game progresses.<br><br>TWIE\u2019s #598 is\u2026eh.  Speaking as a participant in Newbie 1100, yes, TWIE was more active on the whole, but he also had moments where he kinda dropped off the radar.  This post I see as being far more lengthy than his town-efforts in 1100\u2014basically, he\u2019s using six words a lot when only one or two will do.

Scum are more likely to be lurking around and allowing the lynch to proceed without doing too much of the dirty work themselves. Read the comments that I'll post below and you'll notice both of them have at some point pushed some suspicion towards him while also stating they don't fully agree with his lynch.

Honestly, I was most suspicious of our two hydras before, with Krew being suspect #1, and there has been nothing to change that suspicion while I wholeheartedly agree with SP's 467.  I have several somewhat-solid town-reads that I'm making note of, but Krew has never pinged that bit of my brain even once, despite his relatively high activity.  For the most part, the biggest thing that catches my eye seems like Krew flailing in his last few posts and switching to SP in an attempt to find any kind of purchase.

Plus his self-claimed nice theories/bad practice (theories aren't even real gosh darn) is really a skewed view when you have him preferring the mystic trust-me-on-this approach combined with things-are-not-what-they-seem/the-accused-are-innocent approach + the whole newbie intuition worship. <br><br>All just words to clothe a man who never was an philosopher but was in fact a seer. Mafia theory is to mastin what quantum physics is to new age spiritualists. <br><br>And the whole teacher-is-an-allignment-neutral-role shtick is dead wrong. <br><br>A messy character, but leans town atm because I'm not seeing scum motivation behind his plays, even his messy ones (and he seems pretty on the ball compared to a lot of these jokers). Like attracts like? Because he definitely supports the prime mess of jilynne for sharing the newbie moon logic. <br><br>Moon logic because the connection between \"I'm town\" to \"I'll be faking these aspects of myself\" seem bent. I'm taking jilynne as town for now at least mostly almost totally because of the claim, but also because of the targeting she had received for some non-scummy things; doesn't cause absolutes but it helps lowers those probabilities from where I'm standing. But there is a messy mental structure that leads to the self-admitted semi-deceptions and personality falsifications engaged in by jilynne being used for pro-town purposes. \"I'm genuinely that newbish, but I'm not genuinely that lost or confused\" = the question asking routine is a ruse? For what end? NK-proofing? Lost sheep meta? Has used the thread largely as a conversation board which makes actual motivation searches come up empty. <br><br>Of course some players have put great emphasis on their clean tells and logic. They are not magic spells. Turning disputes over scumminess into disputes over which magic spell is best and then applying the winner to your chosen victim is a certified scum method of scum hunting. You get to skip the whole situation of looking for real scum since you're only trying to 1. look like you're hunting and 2. get townies dead. <br><br>Ironhead is pure magician at first though he has been improving. I was put off by his jousting partner Secret Project starting right off from the beginning as well. Which leads me to wonder how some of you folks got strong town reads on them early on, most namely WormyKrew, who despite their vote on and apparent suspicion towards Ironhead manage to find town-positive actions in the largest pointless disputes and commentary that characterize his early play. Their expression, application and holding of early views on jilynne strike me as forced and scum style grasping. That's part of why I was okay with supporting a WK wagon, plus general scum vibes. But like I said I think the scummy lurkers are gonna be more of a problem. Let the scummy-non-lurkers build up some more interactions/reactions to days/flips and they will illuminate their alignments."}

Just that jilynne's laziness (not wanting to \"rewrite 5 sentences\") is apparently a scum tell. With WormyKrew and Secret Project already expressing suspicion and jilynne being a player who very obviously won't be able to defend herself well, this is scummy as hell.<br><br>wierdalex does the same thing in 92, except that it's worse because it's sheeping what TWIE said* (meaning that weirdalex is managing to add even less to the case than TWIE's nothing) and he's the 4th person to express suspicion of jily as opposed to the 3rd.<br><br>*As DY notes in 101.<br><br>96: WormyKrew reconsiders his suspicions on Ironhead a bit, switches to voting jilynne.

I probably won't get into it much, but suffice it to say that Secret Project's case is/was weak (as I've said before) while Ironhead doesn't get that Secret Project was saying that the way/why Ironhead was appealing was scummy, not that appealing is in itself scummy.<br>---<br>Post 150 (Gerhard Krause) is still scummy, but I've talked about it before.

I will grant that WormyKrew and Secret Project were posting in between 199 and 210, but they didn't actually say anything new. And monk had to have had a reason for thinking Ironhead was town, so it wasn't even a change of null to scum.<br><br>241<blockquote><div><cite>Mastin wrote:</cite>Gerhard is a mislynch.

Everyone please reply.</div></blockquote>So what changed? I get the feeling in 276 that jilynne doesn't want to vote WK because she, in her own words, \"[has] nothing on [him] yet.\" But as is plainly visible she turns around and votes WK anyway. The only person advocating gut feeling strongly was SP; but Captain Corporal and Ironhead both told her to be careful about it, i..e., don't trust it completely.<br><br><br>321:<blockquote><div><cite>Captain Corporal wrote:</cite>Alduskkel -<br>To be honest, I AM pretty unsure of what I'm doing.

There is nothing you can accomplish by making a fool of yourself.</div></blockquote>If you're up against a good enough Mafia team, you're never probably never going to get big obvious scumtells.

Pretty sure you were saying I was suspecting people on the wagon.<br><br>Not a whole lot until 424. TWIE essentially posts theory.

Anyway, the reasoning here is... nonexistent. And it's bandwagoning. That plus the rolefishing (and WK's um... unique... response to DY's attack) is making me reconsider my read on WormyKrew.<br><br>527:<blockquote><div><cite>Mastin wrote:</cite>Lol.<br><br>No, seriously.<br><br>Just...lol.<br><br>I don't know what in that post makes me laugh, but it's just extremely lolworthy.

In a vacuum, or compared to other rational posts, you two might not appear so townish. But when you can generate several posts of pointing out the profound flaws in other player's flailing, you capitalize upon their scumminess to appear townish. Whether you are town or scum, you didn't have to try hard to achieve authenticity in your posts because those other players really are posting that poorly.<br><br>As DY asked, \"Why is this bad for the town when I am town?\" The answer is that it is not, <span style=\"font-style: italic\">if</span> you are town; but I don't know that you are town, and my impression of you is based on your posting. If your posting is skewed townish due to the scummy posting of others, then my read of you is affected directly.<br><br>...<br><br>I agree with Soben that it is suspiciously difficult to generate momentum on a TWIE wagon. He has certainly done enough to appear scummy enough for a wagon; although on the other hand, there are several players who have been acting scummy. Some of them -- including both Secret Project and WormyKrew -- appear to be unpredictable and illogical players, and that casts a modicum of doubt on my reads of them. But with TWIE, it appears that he knows what he is doing, and the recent raging is problematic. Like Soben, I would like to see the previous game where he raged and flipped town; until then, I will join this bandwagon:<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: WORMYKREW</span><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: TWIE</span>"}

It admittedly was not a very good attempt, but it had the tone of a newb-town player.<br><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Jily wrote:</cite>4) Well, I'm assuming RQS is Random Question Stage. I prefer RQS, because I can get more information. I dislike RVS, because it's too easy to kill a person too early. Oh, and I've only played with RVS, but I dislike it.</div></blockquote> This is the kind of assumption I'd only see with a town train of thought. Dislikes what she's seen in the past, and so assumes that the alternative (RQS) is better. I don't think Jily as scum would think like that.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>/confirm<br>Sorry, meant to confirm on my first post.</div></blockquote>This is another bit of a town-tell, the fact that she was so intent on playing the game that she forgot to confirm.<br><br>\"Why's that a towntell rather than a null-tell?\"<br><br>Because she was specifically looking forward to scumhunting. It's in her tone. If she was scum, she wouldn't go, \"oh, goody, I'm so excited I get to deceive the town! This will be so much fun!\" and forget. It just doesn't work that way.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Jily wrote:</cite>I was just going to post a whole thing about ironhead and some other stuff, and then I realized we're still pregame. I bet this game's gonna turn out well. Especially with all this activity.</div></blockquote>The fact that she put the effort into this should tell you she was town. The fact that she was anticipating the game should tell you she is town. The fact that she scrapped it all thinking it wasn't needed should make you realize she was town who simply saw no need to post it.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Jily wrote:</cite>Well, I don't feel like typing it up again, so in a nutshell, I pretty much wrote the following:<br><br>I don't like RVS either (meaing that although I like spectating, I don't like participating.) And that not liking RVS isn't necesarilly a scum tell.</div></blockquote>This furthers the feeling. <br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Please explain this part of your post, it was basically useless. (I'm sorry if I missed something, I probably did, but can someone explain the point of it anyways?) </div></blockquote>Reads as a town tone, this not understanding.<br><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>TWIE wrote:</cite>RVS. Votes are info.</div></blockquote> I can't pin it down. (So call it Gut if you MUST, though this doesn't feel like gut.) But something in here makes this feel town, rather than null. Something about the Tone just seems to be in the mind-set of a pro-town player.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>What information related to the game have we gained from knowing timezones, games completed, and projected activity level?</div></blockquote> This makes it a little more explicit. It doesn't have the slight condescending/scolding tone I'd expect from scum. It has the curious, puppy-like feeling of a pro-town player legitimately asking, wanting to get a real answer rather than a rhetorical one.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Alright... then based on our responses to those questions who looks the most like scum?</div></blockquote>Again, this appears to be legitimately trying to get an answer, to get real info from Jily. Rather than a rhetorical (slightly condescending) question. Tone is everything.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><span class=\"noboldsig\">/late to the RVS party</span><br>Vote Jily<br><br>You couldn't be bothered to rewrite 5 sentences?</div></blockquote>Contrary to popular belief, this is NOT a scum way of thinking. Quite the opposite, I've never, EVER seen scum think this way. It's always town. Especially the bolded.<br><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Iron wrote:</cite>4. I prefer RQS. It is too easy for scum to fly under the radar in RVS, because of course their votes are not random.</div></blockquote> This methodical approach to the game seems like a town take on things. Iron was essentially advocating equal pressure on all players, which RQS generates. Equal pressure--&gt;equal attention on all players--&gt;scum can't slip under the radar. In other words, Iron was quite logically deducing that the best strategy for the town was the RQS.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Why must RVS result in bandwagons? Couldn't it proceed with an approximately equal distribution of votes among several candidates?</div></blockquote>This furthers the above, in that Iron wanted equal distribution, equal pressure applied, rather than focusing on a single player via bandwagoning.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>By the way, I hate unjustified bandwagons -- another way for scum to fly under the radar.</div></blockquote>To Iron, everything must have a reason behind it. And if the reason is invisible, Iron can't analyze it. And therefore, to Iron, it looks bad. This shows a town thought process, in that he's trying to make sense of the game.<br><br>Also, since this is not the first time I've worked on an Ironhead is Town case, my notes from last time:<br>(Abandoned due to Scumhunter Rendering it pretty unnecessary, but still...)<br><blockquote><div><cite>Mastin wrote:</cite>Equal distribution. I don't know about you, but to me, this sounds like a logical approach to the game: balance things out equally, rather than tip the scales towards one person. (A bandwagon.)<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Iron wrote:</cite>I thought I made the connection pretty solid between what wierdalex said and what the implication is. Are you indicting the connection? If so, where exactly did I fail to connect the argument to the conclusion?</div></blockquote>Key word usage here. \"Connect\". Multiple times. In this context, it's very strong.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I think RQS generates more useful discussion than RVS -- besides, not everyone gets pressured during RVS.</div></blockquote>This makes logical sense, since Random Votes for Random Reasons are difficult (some say impossible, though I disagree) to decipher, whereas Random Questions and Answers are comparatively easier to figure out. It also creates a valid point about pressure, again bringing up the logical, \"balanced\" view from Ironhead.</div></blockquote><br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I have asked you to explain your failure to follow my logic (please review post #68) and you have not only ignored it, but you continue to obfuscate. You are not acting in the best interests of the town. If you wish to exercise the town's power to lynch, it is incumbent upon you to demonstrate a strong reason. Saying \"I personally want to see Iron go first\" is not a compelling reason.<br><br>I am a stickler for unimpeachable logic (as splitfarvle can attest, as we just finished a game together). If you are going to sling faulty logic through this game, I will identify it as garbage for you. Poor logic in itself is not a definitive scum-tell, but it is not pro-town.</div></blockquote>This quote shows both his firm devotion to putting logic back into scumhunting, along with prodding WormyKrew somewhat, testing them, to get a feel for whether they're just anti-town playstyle, or anti-town role. (In other words, scumhunting.)<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>The point is, the uninformed town can be manipulated by the scum without even knowing they are being manipulated <span class=\"noboldsig\">[*snip*]</span> and no one can avoid having to take an early stand on some semi-relevant question.</div></blockquote>When this is combined, you end up getting a solid town-read from Iron. It's hard to explain. Like it only comes from a town perspective. I'm trying to figure out an explanation for it. It's just a thought process, a thought pattern, a kind of Motivation (I suppose) that only comes from town.<br><br><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Alex wrote:</cite>Was that a serious [pregame] vote (I mean, it won't count, but is it with the intent of voting me when the game starts)? Because I don't see what we would really get out of just voting everybody randomly.</div></blockquote> This is one of the possible hints that Alex is town. His curious attitude doesn't read in this post to me as being scum.

There's no Weasel Wording. No, \"so far\" after \"been\". Nothing to suggest that it's changed in this game. If it had changed, I'd expect something like \"Up to this point, all I've been\", or \"All I've been so far is\", \"all I've been previously is\", \"All I have been is\", \"All I have been in the past\", etc. Something like that, if it weren't the case right now.<br><br>I didn't see that.

Trying to paint something as scummy that's totally null.</div></blockquote>Immediately comes to scumhunting the moment he can. It gives off that town impression.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Notice how his language changes in between his 2nd and 3rd post. It's an interesting defense, I've never seen it done, but he enhances his language after me and worm got on him, as if that makes him look more town.</div></blockquote>I have a hard time believing scum would pick up in a change of tone in posts. It's something a pro-town player would think of, though. It also gives off the town tunnel vibe, rather than the scum tunnel vibe. <br><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Elsa wrote:</cite>Town, easily. There's SO much less pressure on me, and therefore much less lurking (such is usually my awful scum playstyle). In all, it makes for a more active/fun game for me.</div></blockquote> This gives me reason to believe Elsa's town, since if she wasn't, she'd be more obligated to replace out. Why? She's V/LA and would have more pressure. She's V/LA and would know that'd mean she'd appear to be lurking.<br><br>She's V/LA and doesn't want to get out, so she must be having fun.<br><br>See where this is going?<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Elsa wrote:</cite>Hah, I had no idea that votes were not counting yet.

It was, specifically, \"Jily is playing really bad\". <br><br>Saying someone is Anti-Town makes no statement either way. It's neutral. Saying someone is scummy makes a statement that you think they're more likely to be scum (most frequently, anyway). <br><br>\"Playing Bad\", on the other hand, has the OPPOSITE implication, that you think they're TOWN. And yet, they vote Jily, anyway. Hence, the scumslip.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Why would it matter in the first place if we were in pregame or not?

When I made the post you're referring to, it was impossible to know that Jily was that weak of a player--this was way before her drawn-out role claim, ink vomit, and etc.  Additionally, I've long since changed my tune and have been adamant in saying that we aren't lynching Jily today, despite her \"easy lynch\" status.

Two of the three times I was lynched as scum, it was because I was caught after a buddy had flipped.

In the former two cases, that means a mutual bus was in effect on D1, which might work in the instance of Alex, since we cross-voted relatively early, but certainly not in the case of Ald, where I was vacillating and working on a case on him for a long time--if I were scum, it'd be much easier to just bus him, knowing that I was right.  As for WK, note what I said to Mastin earlier in the game when he voted WK--why would Mastin vote for his #1 scumread's #1 scumread?  Because his #1 scumread is actually town.<br><br>All of that is to say (in the above paragraph)--Mastin tends to put a lot of emphasis on VC and association in his scumhunting, but if you go by association, the only possible partner who Mastin also suspected that might make a lick of sense would be Alex--except that I have had my vig vote parked on him for a while now, so I am clearly unafraid of him dying and potentially flipping scum.

As such I am going to say, frankly, that a vote for me is a vote for a mislynch.  Simple as that.

Unfortunately, I didn't see it when monk was playing but I can see it looking back at him. Of course there's the obvious bias I have in thinking brokenscraps is scummy so I'm inclined to look back and see his posts as scummy to back myself up.<br><br>monk iso 0: I read bits and pieces of mastin's Yoshi case and I think he overhyped the oddness of the way he thinks. It's different from what I've seen before but in no way is it weird, and it makes quite a bit of sense. Tone is always important. And look at mastin's criticism of Yoshi's tone in his RVS vote. monk's tone here is exactly the same. The vote is exactly the same. \"It's unnatural, artificial.\" (This is also why mastin will be more likely to be scum when brokenscraps flips scum)<br><br>iso 5: For some reason a lot of players feel like not having their vote on someone at all times is scummy. I consider it town play to have an extended period of time during any day where the player's vote isn't on anyone. It isn't necessarily scummy that monk placed a vote but the fact that he placed it before the game started and then confirmed it like it was serious when it's based on a forced joke about his profile name. Freaking terrible.<br><br>iso 9: People are always busy. There's always real life in the way. I'm no stranger to the \"hi, I'll catch up soon\" post, and it's certainly not a scum tell, but just the number I've seen of these from both players, there's 2 from monk and I wanna say 3 from brokenscraps. Including one specific one I've gotten to and will get to again. It's not necessary.  But in a game like this where (mastin is right) we've been mostly lurker hunting, there would be a drive for them, as scum, to remain active and not be seen as scummy because of lurking. Whether it's actually beyond their control or not (I don't believe anybody lurks to hide from the game), the fact that they both commented on multiple occasions to let us know they would be back soon looks like some subconscious (unintentional) need for approval from the town.<br><br>iso 10: It works with my other scum reads. Granted, the way brokenscraps reversed his predecessor's read on krew, I'm gonna say that if he's scum, krew is more likely to not be. We'll be lynching them both, of course, but still. mastin is MUCH more likely to be scum with brokenscraps, and alex, of course, is just scum with whoever's scum. scraps' level of noncommittal on alex is fun to watch.<br><br>iso 11 and 12: scumhunting as scum is hard, especially since people tend to make it so unnatural. monk is clearly having problems with scumhunting and resorts to lurker hunting early in the game before anyone else actually did it. I think scum have a problem with scumhunting because they know what is and isn't a scum tell. It's easy too fall back on fake but common ones such as lurking to sound as if contribution is actually happening. In actuality, monk didn't contribute a thing except that scum list that can be used to find his buddies on later.<br><br>iso 13: Said this before but how the heck does a document go awry?<br><br>brokenscraps iso 0 and 11: more of dat appeasing<br><br>iso 1: it scares me that nobody cared to mention how terribly scummy all around this post is. He doesn't even deign to comment on that vote in future posts. However, in iso 2 and 3 it becomes clear that he intends to follow monk's precedent in not actually scumhunting, just attacking lurkers. He puts a vig vote on alex but then says the EXACT (down to the same wording) same thing about elsa. I wonder why he chose to vig alex over elsa. His reads on them are apparently for nothing except their play being semi-lurky. Also, notice how absolutely sure he sounds on alex. Never again in his posts does he say anything as convinced as \"pretty obviously... scum\" as he does about alex's play here. It's common practice for scum to bus their weaker partner. Sounding right is VERY commonly misconstrued as sounding pro-town, so if alex were to flip scum, brokenscraps knows he'd get town points for this post.<br><br>p-edit: I take that back. He sounds so sure of himself one more time, which I'll get to in iso 6.<br><br>iso 4: more ridiculous focus on lurking. How is lurking scummy? Where is the scum motivation? This isn't scum hunting. Also he seems to be a fan of hopping on the leading wagons. Look at it. focuses on wormykrew when he comes in with a vig vote for alex, and mentions of elsa, then as the TWIE wagon picks up he's right on it. Each time it's for an accusation of lurking except in the case of krew which he couldn't think of a lie for since he's not lurking.<br><br>iso 6: Take a look at this<br><blockquote><div><cite>brokenscraps in iso 2 wrote:</cite>weirdalexv is pretty obviously a semi-lurking scum</div></blockquote><br><blockquote><div><cite>brokenscraps in iso 6 wrote:</cite>Case on Wierdalex is clearly garbage. I don't need to explain why.</div></blockquote><br>Ok now that looks bad, right? But it gets worse. Someone take a guess at how many posts are in between his iso 2 and his iso 6.<br><div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: Idk, pacman how many posts were in between his iso 2 and his iso 6?</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display: none;\">FUCKING 7 AND HALF OF THEM, OBVIOUSLY ARE BY BROKENSCRAPS HIMSELF AND NOT ONE IS BY ALEX</div></div></div><br><br>iso 7, 8, 9, 10: commented on these already, really and they're mostly boring posts about semantics. I love how he is taking so many of my base fake scumhunting tells and giving me perfect examples of them. lurker hunting, inconsistent reads, chivalrous town defending, and arguing semantics for long-winded posts that don't get anybody anywhere but look pretty nice.<br><br>Everything you should need to want to lynch him is there.

WormyKrew's posts contain a lot of things which tend to give the aura of trying to get on people's good sides. <span class=\"noboldsig\">OK</span><br><br>More than that, a bit of a crazy theory: They decided Ear would represent them until the hydra got activated. Then, they got the scum PM. Ear got worried, not liking to play as scum. Sleepy took over specifically because Sleepy likes being scum. <span class=\"noboldsig\">We got the PM long before the switch. Sleepyhead is more active than earhead, hence the switch.</span><br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>VOTE: ironhead<br>We both agree that his single post was scummy. It's like he's trying to avoid RVS... I wonder why?</div></blockquote> This seems like blatant sheeping/parroting of the other hydra, Secret Project. <span class=\"noboldsig\">Yeah, we agreed. I must be scum for agreeing with someone.</span><br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Not liking RVS is obvscum. Lynchlynchlynch<br>RQS is not pressure.</div></blockquote>So, essentially, Sleepy went after the easy wagons of Jily (newb) and Ironhead (Secret Project supported). <span class=\"noboldsig\">Or the two people I think are scummy.</span><br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Anyways, your preference doesn't matter.

This town has already chosen RVS and not participating is counterproductive and scummy.</div></blockquote>This tone is that of the typical condescending scum. <span class=\"noboldsig\">I'm a condescending person.</span><br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>So, I'm thinking Iron/jil team? I personally want to see Iron go first.</div></blockquote>Making the above official, after Secret had reaffirmed his dislike of both, essentially, further buddying up to Secret by sheeping his reads. <span class=\"noboldsig\">Or, we agree *gasp*</span><br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>UNVOTE: <br>VOTE: Jil</div></blockquote>Blatant bandwagoning. <span class=\"noboldsig\">Voting someone we've said was scum.</span><br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Jil is playing really bad.</div></blockquote>The thing is. There's a huge difference between \"playing bad\" and \"scum\". <br><br>By stating \"Jily is playing really bad\", WormyKrew has effectively scumslipped, in revealing they think Jily is town, playing bad, not scum. See how that works? <br><br>It wasn't \"Jily is anti-town\". Voting someone anti-town is a bit of a newb-mistake, but is mostly null. It wasn't \"jily is scummy\". That'd be scumhunting. It was, specifically, \"Jily is playing really bad\". <br><br>Saying someone is Anti-Town makes no statement either way. It's neutral. Saying someone is scummy makes a statement that you think they're more likely to be scum (most frequently, anyway). <br><br>\"Playing Bad\", on the other hand, has the OPPOSITE implication, that you think they're TOWN. And yet, they vote Jily, anyway. Hence, the scumslip. <span class=\"noboldsig\">Or if a scum player is extremely scummy, then they're also \"playing bad\".</span><br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Why would it matter in the first place if we were in pregame or not? You could've still posted your thoughts.</div></blockquote>This is the condescending scum Tone. Not the legitimately curious town tone. <span class=\"noboldsig\">You know the answer.</span><br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Jil needs massive pressure</div></blockquote>This? This is a further admittance to knowing Jily is town. How? \"Massive Pressure\", rather than \"desperate need of rope\". It's just how town thinks. Town doesn't think, \"this person's scummy, so they need massive pressure\". <br><br> They'll either think, \"Oh, this person needs some pressure VOTE: person\", or \"this person needs rope\". It's all in the exact wording. Details are vital, giving off a completely different feel to a post. <span class=\"noboldsig\">What's the difference?</span></div></blockquote><br>Congrats mastin, great case."}

The only thing that lends TWIE additional town cred is WormyKrew's late vote for him -- justified not as a scum-read (which wold be consistent with busing), but justified as the quickest way to end the day.

Assuming a 10:3 setup, WK may have been bussed by one buddy, but I am guessing that if that was the case, the other buddy stayed off the wagon.

The TWIE-wagon generated after players noted TWIE's scummy behavior. In other words, I don't think the TWIE wagon was ginned up by scum to reverse momentum on WK wagon. The WK wagon faltered in the middle of the day and only came on strong toward the end -- not enough time for scum to throw their weight behind a TWIE wagon.

The entire idea of a counter-wagon always being town relies heavily on the fact that the person pushing it was the alternate wagon choice. In this particular case it would rely on the strength of Wormys push on the TWIE wagon which was extremely weak. In fact his vote reads as a last ditch attempt to seem pro-town rather than actually getting TWIE lynched, furthermore both TWIE and Sleepys lack of effort and avoidance of the thread near the deadline makes perfect sense if it were to be a double scum wagon."}

I thought that perhaps he was a scum playing it straight and trying to push TWIE as a straightforward alternative wagon to WK. But; I feel that \"they\" (or at least one of the heads) think like I do. So it was easy for me to put myself in their shoes. He seemed genuine and passionate about his town-read on WK and his scum-read on TWIE; I think someone who misses big is more townish than someone who misses small. It is also more townish than someone who knows for certain that someone will flip scum and cannot be perturbed about that scum-read throughout the day, and Soben was self-questioning throughout the day. An underlying theme to Soben's disagreement with the WK wagon is that he found valid reasons to disagree with it, as opposed to the normal scum tactic of grasping at straws to come up with reasons not to vote someone -- for example, the way he dismissed mastin2's case as incoherent. Also, there was apparently disagreement between the two heads of the hydra, which is indicative that at least half their mind did not accord WK a town read. So overall -- it reinforced my read of him before the hammer, which is that he is a very strong town-read."}

When I posted this.<br>It sparked a thought.<br><br>\"Wait. Why WASN'T <span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"font-style: italic\">Soben</span></span> killed?!?\"<br><br>Because. Let's face it. On Day one--in order--the three least suspected players were Soben, myself, and Secret.<br><br>Secret was third-least-suspected, and yet, got killed over myself, and Soben.<br><br>That left the burning question--why.<br>Why wasn't Soben targetted?<br><br>There had been SERIOUS interest in a Secret lynch. Admittedly, most of the town (~75% of it, if I had to guess) had Secret as town. But there were a few, seriously calling Secret scum. And a lot of people (myself included!) had their town-read on Secret slightly diminish as the day went on.<br><br>What made them such a fantastic nightkill? When there were at least two players less suspected? (As far as they knew, there was no way either myself or Soben would ever be lynched, due to how little support there was.)<br><br>I bounced this thought around a little. And then I came to this. <blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Third off: {Broken, Iron, Soben, Alex} contains EXACTLY one scum. No more. If Alex isn't it, <span class=\"noboldsig\">I actually have a good idea of who it is.</span></div></blockquote> I wasn't sure. It DEFINITELY wasn't Iron. But {Broken, Soben, Alex} contained one scum. I had thought it to be Alex. But the contagion spread: what if it isn't him. What if he's actually town? Who would it be?<br>Broken or Soben.<br><br>And the thought at the time was \"probably Soben, but it *could* be Broken...\" This thought lasted until Twisted came in. The \"alex is not scum\" thought still wavered, but evidence continued to grow. <blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>wierdalexv 3 (L-3) Darth Yoshi, jilynne1991, Elsa Von Spielburg</div></blockquote>Half-way to a lynch, in so little time, somewhat suspicious, to say the least.<br><br>A dead giveaway that my thought process was changing? <blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>2. splitfarvie Scumhunter &lt;--Null, town-lean.<br>NULL: <br>Alex<br>Soben<br>Broken<br>Alex</div></blockquote> Soben was my strongest town-read day one. (Secret was at a close second, if memory serves.) And had suddenly dropped way back down to Null. (Albeit as a town-lean.) I was beginning to become forgetful of why I read Soben as town.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div> But I've got an idea in my head. An idea which refuses to die. I know, I hate it, but it happens.</div></blockquote> The idea was--of course--\"Soben is not the pro-town player you thought them to be...\"<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>But to answer your question. If I eliminated both you and Soben (trust me--I noticed you two were in both groups quite some time ago) from both groups, then that leaves Broken (a town-read) and Alex (a...well... ... ...yeah. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\">) in that group, and Ald/Yoshi in the other.<br><br>Those lists I posted, I know are on to something.</div></blockquote> This was another hint. In that I was very careful to make it clear that it was an \"if\" eliminating Iron AND Soben. (Iron, sure. If Iron's scum, he deserves a scummy nom as far as I'm concerned. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\">) I also made it clear that Broken (town-read) was there, and Alex was not strong enough of a read to be confident in.<br>In other words, \"I really can't eliminate Soben. Sorry. I just...can't.\"<br><br><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3168147#p3168147\" class=\"postlink\">978</a> was the first post Soben made since this read had developed. And...it made me think. \"...How did I get such a strong town-read on them?!?\" It continued with pretty much every post they made, dragging me further into the tunnel. More and more, I was beginning to think, \"You need to stop holding onto the dead Day1 town-read of Soben and see the truth.\" And from there, it got stronger.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>If I'm right, I DEFINITELY will not support an Alex lynch, for starters.</div></blockquote> ^That, for instance, was me basically augmenting the above by saying, \"I'm...not sure Alex is scum, anymore.\"<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Iron wrote:</cite>I thought that perhaps he was a scum playing it straight and trying to push TWIE as a straightforward alternative wagon to WK.</div></blockquote>And this certainly did not help.<br><br>I need to do a re-read, because if I'm just being paranoid, this tunnel vision will be quite anti-town. But, there's always another option. That I wasn't wrong, after all. That Soben really IS scum, like most Day Two posts are saying to me.<br><br>Essentially. I need to determine if what I did was Snap something into place (having abandoned my Dead Reads), make a magical realization which makes perfect sense...or if it's plain ol' tunnel visioning, paranoia about someone who is firmly town, with the early-play indeed being the town which I saw it as.<br><br>Sorry. It's now 2:20 am, here, so I'm not explaining it that well. I think I'm rambling right now.<br><br><br>Addressing Twisted: That's another thing which is making me doubt Alex scum, as well as you.<br><br>Since I predicted one scum in {Alex, Broken/You, Iron, Soben}, and you pointed out a townslip which might clear Alex, in addition to me having cleared Iron...<br><br>...Well, let's just say that it's been spreading this Cancer just that much faster about Soben as Scum."}

I do take Alex's question directed towards Wormy as a town-slip however I wouldn't consider it to be that strong of one and certaintly not one that moves my read of him from null to strong town.<br><br>Mastin, you're attempting to read too far into the night kill and missing the obvious fact that Secret pushed towards Wormy throughout the entire day and therefore was essentially clear and impossible for mafia to push against whereas I spend a portion of day one with a town read on Wormy and actually defended him. The choice should have been relatively easy for them however prior to the flip I stated the entirety of my reads expecting to be night killed (For the sole reason that I thought Wormy was going to flip town).

When I read through her mafia game to find out what her meta was like it was very apparent that she was capable and willing to put in the effort needed furthermore her desire to be lynched earlier than later reads as a town-tell. Jillyn if your policy is to pay less attention and focus in games that you're town because it's boring for the love of god please don't join any more games, you need to deal with your prior commitments first. <br><br>I just realized my reasoning behind the 'WK vig-voted Elsa therefore Elsa is town' is complete rubbish, WK would have known of the existance of a roleblocker therefore knowing that no vigshot would go through. With that said I'm still leaning town on Elsa but badly need a conversation with Scumhunter."}

I don't think this helps a scum wierdalex much unless the team is DarthYoshi and wierdalex. In which case that's something of a WTF.<br><br>On the other hand, wierdalex also gives random, unexplained town points to Elsa in 1011.

For that matter, Day 2 has been pretty lackluster to say the least. I would say that this is kind of arbitrary though:<blockquote><div><cite>TwistedSpoon wrote:</cite>I had completely forgotten about TheWay's existence<br><br>I'd class him as town for now though since I'm sold on scum being in {Elsa, Aldusskel, Alex}</div></blockquote>In terms of coasting, I'd say TWIE should definitely be a consideration if Elsa and me are also considerations. But with neither TWIE nor TS being dead now connections between them will only be useful if one flips scum.<br><br>What I get from 1017: I'm scum for pretty much not doing a whole lot. Maybe throw in the supposed wagoning of CC (who actually has never been seriously up for lynching).<br><br>Fair enough, I guess. Though, TS agrees with me on some points in there, so at the very least he must think I am contributing some. Whereas he barely mentions TWIE. Aside from the above quote, he says he'll \"trust Mastin on TWIE being town.\"<br><br>Yeah, if TWIE is scum then TS is too, and vice versa.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Twistedspoon wrote:</cite>immediately obvious is this<blockquote><div><cite>WormyKrew wrote:</cite>Town-<br>DarthYoshi<br>Jilynne1991<br>Alduskkel<br>Secretproject</div></blockquote><br>Alduskkel as a town read, what's wrong with that? Well this reference is the only time in the krew ISo that he ever mentions Alduskkel. At all...</div></blockquote>You know who else is on that town list and isn't mentioned beforehand either? SecretProject and DarthYoshi. And while both of those people are mentioned later, WormyKrew does not have any hard interactions with them. There's questioning and such, but it's very light. And not too different from just ignoring them.<br><br>I get that you don't bother noting that for SecretProject. But considering that you said DarthYoshi was suspect in 1017, I would have thought you would have said something about that too.<br><br>Additionally, WormyKrew also barely mentions TWIE either. One time he calls him a null read. Another time he indicates some suspicion. And the last time he makes a lackluster survivalist vote on him. I don't remember who said it before, but if there were 2 scum wagons Day 1, as I am beginning to suspect, then scum wouldn't care too much about which way the lynch was shifted. And that would correspond with both TWIE and WK not pushing each other too hard. In fact, TWIE never voted WK.<br><br>The most outrageous thing about 1020 is that it does not address even the existence of my wall. Seriously?

Although I think DY is town, if he's scum then I could see him trying to clear out the \"If Ald isn't scum, DarthYoshi is\" mentality so that if/when I get lynched (or NK'd... but that's unlikely) he isn't next in line.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Mastin wrote:</cite>Stop wasting time on the smaller wagons.

I don't understand the continual stating that WK vig-votting Elsa is a town-tell when it would be abundantly obvious to him that Jillyn would be roleblocked therefore there was never any threat of it leading towards his own partner being shot but at the same time I don't have a strong read on Elsa either way right now.<br><br>I have to agree with Mastin, Post #1189 by Alduskkel was all over the place.

You hadn't really contributed much of note yesterday and <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">what really makes me feeling strange is that you specifically mentioned next to nothing about the WK wagon for the entirety of d1</span>. What makes it particularly interesting is that you had no problem commenting on both the TWIE and Elsa wagons but strangely ignored the WK wagon for the most of the day. And what struck me as odd is that you clearly knew the wagon was going on. As quoted above you said you were thinking of putting Krew at L-1 for some pressure. Well a) that defeats the purpose of \"pressure\" votes and b) it appears it could very well be scum-motivated trying to show a willingness to lynch a scum partner for later in the game. If you really wanted to \"pressure\" him you would be asking WK questions and at least commenting on the wagon and suspicions on him that took up a lot of our time and ultimately led to his lynch day 1. It strikes me as strange that these two quotes were the most you ever said about WK yesterday really.<br><br><br>@Mastin, I understand the idea of being paranoid of players who appear obv-town to lots of players. I don't mind the skepticism really. All I ask is that today and going forward you consider your suspicions and temper them with a bit of logic. Think about why you really suspect us...is it because you think we are scum or you are scared of the potential influence we have if we are scum? Which is the greater reason you are expressing doubt? If it is truly, and I mean truly, because you think we are scum, go ahead and present a solid case. I'm willing to listen and to explain our actions to you. I'm not saying you must have us in obv town status because I do think a bit of paranoia and questioning never hurt anyone, self-included. However, your comments like \"WK, Ald, Soben are the 3 confirmed scum\" makes it impossible for Regfan to listen to anything you say and it will annoy me at some point too if it continues. If you have a real case on us to present, please, be my guest.<br><br>I would be very very surprised personally if the scum weren't in [CC, TWIE, Ald, Elsa] <br>Not really sure I like this Ald wagon tbh. We'd be willing to hammer pending a claim, but meh, personally I'd like to go for CC today. Reg thinks an Ald lynch is a good lynch but he'd probably be 3rd on my list to lynch today. Seeing as our vote is doing nothing right now and I regretted not stating and standing by my opinion more yesterday I'm going to go ahead and <span class=\"noboldsig\">unvote, vote: CC</span>. If Reg has a problem with it I'm sure he will qq about it to me in the QT the way he has been about mastin. XD"}

This is not scum taking advantage of a weaker player. This is town, legitimately seeing something which looked scummy and pursuing it.<br><br>Gerhard also commits a town-tell, <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3094997#p3094997\" class=\"postlink\">by voting Jily after her claim</a>. He thought she was scum, and didn't notice her claim. It's a minor tell, which you'd think would be null, but scum tend to read the thread closer and would instantly have noticed the claim, compared to town, who frequently miss details like that. It's also something you can't fake that well.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Gerhard wrote:</cite>For my replacement's benefit, I believe that Iron Head is the most likely to be scum. His language is carefully tailored, which is fine. However, he is hiding behind it to avoid the arguments that he should be having. Secret pac man made a point that he was appealing to logic. Perhaps his wording was not strictly correct, however the context and meaning were plain. Ironhead refuses to give merit to anything that is not perfectly logically structured, which gives him a myriad of excuses to avoid nearly anything. It's like a corporation bogging you down in paper work so that a trial can't progress and you don't get your damages. Ironhead side tracked the argument so that he could yell at secret pac man for not having his Debate lingo spot on rather than actually have to answer to the presumed scum tell. </div></blockquote> There's also this. He went after Ironhead, a wagon which was beginning to die (same as the Jily wagon), and thought the player was legitimately scummy, bringing up a lot of unique points which are obviously not faked.<br><br>There's also the fact that despite replacing out, he still put the work into the game and wanted to leave with the best he could give.<br><br>Additionally, <blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Secondly, I'm not crazy about Mastin, and my gut tells me he is scum.</div></blockquote> I had defended Gerhard as town at the time, and he had a scumread on me.

I realize this doesn't seem significant and it probably was not intentional--but the fact that he used those three tells, against me, means that he was really scumhunting. Since (quite frankly) I can't fake seeing those tells in another. That scumhunting method is completely honest, truthful, and unbiased. Scum can't fake it, scum have trouble using it effectively. It's a signature town move.<br><br><br>Additionally, let's review my tells in this short little while.<br>Motive--extremely town.

This is a personal town-tell of mine. A signature scum move is to go completely against your (scummy) predecessor's views and take up an entirely new stance to (hopefully) become more favorable.<br><br>A TOWN signature is to trust entirely in your predecessor and acknowledge their wisdom. This is especially important if the predecessor was extremely scummy. By embracing the reads of the scummy player, the person is essentially saying, \"my predecessor wasn't scummy by thinking this\". In other words, they're not trying to get a Fresh Start which many towns freely give to replacements.<br><br>It's a subconscious thing. But I've personally done this. As town, I very frequently look at the reads of my predecessor, and value them. I look into them and see why they thought that. While I'll use my own judgement on them to determine if they're right or not, I put significant weight on them.<br><br>And as scum, I just carelessly toss them aside and go, \"screw that, I'm working for myself\", building a new image for me.<br><br>I've observed it in others as well. I see pro-town players frequently employ the logic of their predecessors, and sum players just ignore their predecessor and ask the town to do the same. It might not be something we actively decide to do, but it happens.<br><br>A lot. It's psychological. Not something you're aware of, but something which always happens whether you were thinking about it or not. And that's why it's nearly impossible to fake. <br><br><br>He also used gut. His inability to effectively explain it reads as genuine. Trust me, as someone who has explanation problems, I can tell very well from situations like that if they're faking being unable to effectively explain it, or if they legitimately can't give a good answer.<br><br><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3105286#p3105286\" class=\"postlink\">There's also favorable interactions with WormyKrew</a>. And the fact that he was legitimately scumhunting on Secret. Look at Captain's early posts, and you'll realize he was pushing Secret as scum--something which could only have come from a pro-town player reading Secret as scum.<br><br><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3111889#p3111889\" class=\"postlink\">Captain shows paranoia</a>, thinking about the night-kill, fearing he gave the scum too much information.<br><br>Scum don't do that. They don't show paranoia towards giving out town-reads, because they're scum. They don't gain anything by trying to hide town-reads. They lose nothing by posting them. Town (theoretically) does.<br><br>Additionally, there's the fact that if you look at Captain's reads, he had Secret as solidly scum.<br><br>WHY WOULD THE SCUM NK SOMEONE ONE OF THEIR MEMBERS HEAVILY WAS PUSHING AS SCUM?!??<br><br>(\"...More experienced players talked them out of it?\"<br>Well, that's more evidence against <span class=\"noboldsig\">Ald, <span style=\"font-style: italic\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Soben</span></span></span>, and maybe <strike>Yoshi</strike> as well, then. 'Cause guess what?<br>TWIE, Elsa, Jily, they're all inexperienced. And therefore could not be scum with Captain in this situation.)<br><br><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3112798#p3112798\" class=\"postlink\">This is an example of an assertive, \"SCREW YOU\" tone</a>. There's Scum \"SCREW YOU!\" (Soben displays this to me), and there's town \"SCEW YOU!\". This is definitely the latter.<br><br>The fact that Captain was stubbornly refusing to vote was also town--he was thinking for himself, trying to figure out what to do, rather than (as scum would do) placing a vote blindly at request.<br><br>Do you think <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3125198#p3125198\" class=\"postlink\">scum would so heavily use Chainsaw Defense</a>, <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3116979#p3116979\" class=\"postlink\">after pointing out a percieved Chainsaw</a>?<br><br>Quick answer, No.<br>Captain also furthered his Secret suspicion, and was (in my opinion) legitimately convinced that WormyKrew was town, due to the interactions between the two Hydras.<br><br><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3144627#p3144627\" class=\"postlink\">Opinions like this</a>, a stubborn scumread on Elsa which refused to die, makes Captain even more town. <br><br><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3161739#p3161739\" class=\"postlink\">There was no point in saying this as scum</a>. Contrary to popular belief, scum do not say obvious stuff like that, anymore. This was a town-reaction. Followed up with a decent conclusion, and more legitimate scumhunting from Captain.<br><br><br>A tl;dr version?<br><br>Captain has consistently been tripping town-tells across the board, has been showing a consistent town Motivation in his posts, has been bleeding off a town Tone, and his interactions are overall fairly favorable.<br><br>HE IS NOT THE LYNCH TODAY."}

I'd expect zero scum to be on (1) wagons at this point. I'd expect one scum on each (3) wagon. WormyKrew takes care of the scum on Jily. (By Proxy, this clears TWIE and Alex.) That leaves split as the scum in not voting, unless you're going for the insane Jily-scum idea. (No. Just No. If you want evidence? Look at how hard WormyKrew was pushing Jily as scum in the rage of pages 4-6. That was NOT bussing, people.) What of the (2) wagons? Combine them and you get a single four wagon. Gerhard/Captain is among those names, sure (another anti-Gerhard/Captain-as-scum is <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3095603#p3095603\" class=\"postlink\">the top of this post</a>, which does not read as scum-scum interactions), as is Yoshi and monk/broken/Twisted.

It woulda been a scumtell had you said you preferred to play as scum.\" That part in both of them is fine. It is the same. The contradiction in here comes from what isn't there. \"Pretty RVS\". Does not translate to \"rather vote someone who might have committed a scumtell rather than Random\".<br><br>See the contradiction? I do. <br><br>160 additionally contains some suspicious interactions with WormyKrew, in the form of Ald's \"Hardly\". <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Ald wrote:</cite>@Secret Project 104 (not quoting the whole thing): Don't you think it's more likely that Ironhead's posting style change is due to our shift from the goofy RVS/RQS stage to serious mafia business time?</div></blockquote>Call it parroting, call it fluff, call it active lurking, call it whatever.

Like it contains valuable insight into the game?<br><br>Well, sorry to inform you, there's nothing in there which hadn't been said before. From Jily Newbtown to Ironhead. It also contains a bit of hypocrisy, as guess what Ald quotes immediately after that? A post by Ironhead, which he responds to with <blockquote><div><cite>Ald wrote:</cite>This reads as OMGUS to me. Obviously when Secret Project asked if everyone was scum in the game, he was using hyperbole, regardless of his alignment. You're nitpicking grammar and basing a vote off of that and the fact that you think that he thinks you're scummy for being logical.

He didn't unvote then, however, and kept it on. <blockquote><div><cite>DarthYoshi wrote:</cite>@Alduskkel: You see Gerhard's derp vote on Jily as a scumtell and not a town tell, why?</div></blockquote> That says it better than I ever could.<br><br>And now.

(Split/Scumhunter/Soben and Gerhard/Captain are both in the scum section.)<br><br>It's worthy noting that pretty much all of WormyKrew's suspects were extremely weak, and it REEKS of bussing in there. But what stinks even more is the town-list. Ald had posted pretty much nothing of content at that time--how the heck did WormyKrew get a town-read on Ald? Quite frankly, I do believe WormyKrew just stereotypically followed the \"one buddy scum, one buddy town\" tactic. This makes all of the Null names town, all of the Town names minus Ald as town, and one of the Scum names as actual scum (Split/Soben), with the others being town. It's almost certainly not Ironhead; those interactions do not look like bussing at ALL. It's VERY doubtfully Alex.<br>Leaving {Gerhard/Captain, Split/Soben} as containing one scum. You're mislynching Captain, but in doing so, you'll be condemning Soben to death, finally, along with Ald.<br><br>Yoshi/Ald containing one scum is pretty much a guarantee. This post where both Yoshi and Ald are mysteriously on the town-list for no apparent reason, kinda solidifies that as one reason among many. And WormyKrew's interactions with DarthYoshi do not give off the scum interacting with scum vibe. (Quite the opposite.) WormyKrew's interactions with Ald suggest...<br>...<br>. . .<br><br>......WHAT interactions with Ald?

I want to rephrase my thoughts on Ironhead/Secret Project. I think Ironhead is right in the argument.  This game is 100% about appeals to something. Appeals to logic, appeals to emotion, appeals to authority. All of those appeals can be used by BOTH scum and town. From Ironhead town pov, I can see him raging at Secret Project because from a quick read-through it looks like Secret Project is trying to \"fos him\" for appealing to logic, when in reality logic is the strongest part of the game.<br><br>Now, I don't really blame Secret Project for pointing out appeal to authority as a possible \"scumtell\". I don't view it as much of a scumtell as I view it as something that would be dangerous for a scum-sided player to have. If scum can establish their authority early on it can cause lots of problems for town for obvious reasons. I feel that this was what he was getting at maybe? The arrogance/appeal to authority/whatever you want to call it is in itself a big fat null tell though.<br><br>I think Ironhead vs Secret Project is very possibly Town v. Town and we shouldn't lynch either.<br><br>jilynne, essentially I believe you are town because I believe your newbie tells.

I know some people will disagree with me on this, but appearing town really should be town's #1 priority. This is even more important than being highly skilled at finding scum in my opinion.<br><br> The most common fail that costs town games is that sometimes people are so quick to attribute classic scumtells \"OMGUS, aTe, vote-hopping, being careful not to piss people off, etc.\" as necessarily indicative of the player who committed that action to be scum. Each player needs to be judged on whether their own playing style is sincere. There is no correct way to play and just as people in this game are different, their actions need to be judged differently.

This was not new insight, but it was passed off as an attempt to look that way. People had already essentially addressed this as early as Split's post.</div></blockquote>Of course it was discussed. But point me to a post where someone raises the idea that the shift was due to a shift in gameplay (RVS--&gt;serious time).<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>mastin2 wrote:</cite><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Overall jilynne seriously tells newbtown.

Like it contains valuable insight into the game?<br><br>Well, sorry to inform you, there's nothing in there which hadn't been said before. From Jily Newbtown to Ironhead. It also contains a bit of hypocrisy, as guess what Ald quotes immediately after that? A post by Ironhead, which he responds to with <blockquote><div><cite>Ald wrote:</cite>This reads as OMGUS to me. Obviously when Secret Project asked if everyone was scum in the game, he was using hyperbole, regardless of his alignment. You're nitpicking grammar and basing a vote off of that and the fact that you think that he thinks you're scummy for being logical. This is not the case.</div></blockquote> ...Casting weak suspicion towards Ironhead.</div></blockquote>There's nothing hypocritical there. I did cast suspicion on Ironhead, but there's nothing in my post that contradicts that.<br><br>Oh, and what was I supposed to do? Not say anything? jily was in the spotlight, and you'd probably accuse me of lurking or something if I had ignored her. Even if I have nothing new to say, it is for the best if I give my thoughts.

(Split/Scumhunter/Soben and Gerhard/Captain are both in the scum section.)<br><br>It's worthy noting that pretty much all of WormyKrew's suspects were extremely weak, and it REEKS of bussing in there. But what stinks even more is the town-list. Ald had posted pretty much nothing of content at that time--how the heck did WormyKrew get a town-read on Ald? Quite frankly, I do believe WormyKrew just stereotypically followed the \"one buddy scum, one buddy town\" tactic. This makes all of the Null names town, all of the Town names minus Ald as town, and one of the Scum names as actual scum (Split/Soben), with the others being town. It's almost certainly not Ironhead; those interactions do not look like bussing at ALL. It's VERY doubtfully Alex.<br>Leaving {Gerhard/Captain, Split/Soben} as containing one scum. You're mislynching Captain, but in doing so, you'll be condemning Soben to death, finally, along with Ald.<br><br>Yoshi/Ald containing one scum is pretty much a guarantee. This post where both Yoshi and Ald are mysteriously on the town-list for no apparent reason, kinda solidifies that as one reason among many. And WormyKrew's interactions with DarthYoshi do not give off the scum interacting with scum vibe. (Quite the opposite.) WormyKrew's interactions with Ald suggest...<br>...<br>. . .<br><br>......WHAT interactions with Ald? (...Yeah.)</div></blockquote>So many assumptions! It could have been buddying. It could be that he liked what few posts I had then. You assume that he was following the 1 scum 1 town strategy.

Scum, as people not truly interested in catching scum, are more likely to do this.</div></blockquote>This is the polar opposite of the truth, and Ald of all people should know this. It's backwards--the people less interested in reading the thread aren't scum. They're town, who're bored. AKA, VTs. (Which fits perfectly with Captain's roleclaim--the slot was playing like a VT. As <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3104871#p3104871\" class=\"postlink\">Secret pointed out</a>, this applied to Captain just as much as Gerhard.) See also: Jily, a perfect example. She wasn't lying when she said she is more interested in the games where she's scum. And if you doubt that's enough, you can also look into me, and realize that this was close to MY belief as well. I put more attention into interesting games. And while if I was under heavy pressure (AKA, close to being lynched), a town-game would be interesting to me, quite frankly, the scum games held my interest a lot more frequently.<br><br>It's a frequent town-tell.</div></blockquote>Double standard ahoy. CC and jily are town for disinterest in the game -- but I'm not? Wouldn't it make sense if I was a VT too?<br><br>Oh, and I actually believe that scum don't read as close Mastin. I don't lie about theory! No matter my alignment. You could ask me post game and my answer would be the same.

Exact wording. As town, he would have asked me to clarify. \"This isn't making sense--could you re-word it?\" or something like that. Instead, he simply flat-out says, \"it doesn't\". Essentially, flat-out saying, \"you're wrong\". Not in a town tone, at all. (Town Tone in this case would be saying \"Mastin, to be blunt, you're wrong\", or something like that. More to the point. Instead, Ald took the subtle approach to say the same thing, AKA, the scum way of discretely discrediting me.)</div></blockquote>I said it that way because that seems like the sort of dry humor, vaguely funny way of responding to what you said.

(Mainly, due to me not getting it for, like, four or five games. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\">) Now? VT's my favorite role of all time. (Yes, really.) The longer you play, the more you learn to enjoy that role. I very frequently note disinterest as a town-tell from people with 2010-2011 joindates. I NEVER note disinterest as a town-tell for someone with, say, a 2007 joindate.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Also, is this supposed to be a scum tell?</div></blockquote>Since when <span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"font-style: italic\">isn't</span></span> hypocrisy a scumtell?<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I said it that way because that seems like the sort of dry humor, vaguely funny way of responding to what you said.

To paraphrase what you're saying,<br>\"It's. A. JOKE.\"<br><br>...Yeah, you're not getting away with writing it off as a joke, Ald. (Heh. I used to believe writing off an earlier post as a joke to be a scumtell a-la-EmpTyger--to some extent, I still do.) There was no town reason to give that sort of humor. Town simply doesn't think that way. Scum give that type of humor all the time, though.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I don't even know where you're getting this weird VC analysis from. How about you examine the reasons people were doing what they were doing at the time instead of just looking at some broad outline and making poor presumptions from it?</div></blockquote>Admittedly, my VCA in the case is a measure of Interaction, rather than Motive or Tone. But quite frankly, measuring Motive and Tone for the votes would be a waste of time, because it wouldn't change the conclusion. I did the reasoning in my head for the voters' motives and tried to remember the tone of the votes off the top of my head, when I did the VCA. And my conclusion remained the same.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>For God's sake, I've said about a million times that the wagon at the time was basically devoid of reasoning. If you address nothing else in this post, address this. Because with the information I was given at the time I feel I made the right call.

The people on the wagon, were right, and you called it \"devoid of reasoning\". Despite it having been right.<br>You're scum. I'm right. The people on the wagon, are right. And you've been calling it essentially reasonless. But despite the \"reasonlessness\", it's right. (And due note that I put quotation marks for a reason.)<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Oooh, it couldn't be that I am a town player concerned about the activity of the game.

What it does mean is that DY was putting words in my mouth and I was pointing that out.</div></blockquote>You're so freakin' full of backtracking you can't even keep your story straight. Now you're implying that you DID suspect people on the wagon.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I obviously have changed my mind. </div></blockquote>But there was nothing to have sparked this change in mind. There was nothing which either of us has done which would have changed your perspective. It's blatant scum contradicion.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Town players drop scum tells too, and I posted those just in case they weren't town.</div></blockquote> ...I have no words.<br>No effing words.<br>For.<br>Just.<br>How.<br>Bad.<br>This.<br>Is.<br><br>I'm literally at a loss of words for just how scummy that is, am stunned that Ald actually said something that stupid, that...blatant.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I wasn't trying to discredit them.

Not both at the same time.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Hey, I just thought it through. I give good insight and somehow that's inside knowledge?</div></blockquote>Yes. If you had just said, \"jily would have been blocked regardless of her target's alignment\", that'd have been null. I said as much. The thought process you used to explain it REEKS of inside knowledge, reeks of being the mind-set of a scum player who thought it through last night and is almost copy-pasting from the Mafia QT. It wasn't the insight which was the problem. It was the thought process used to post said insight. Mindset is one of the strongest sub-sets of Motive.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I meant look at in terms of \"I need to iso these people.\"</div></blockquote>This does not answer the issue.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I wouldn't know if jily had used her shot or not unless I was a tracker, watcher, or jily.</div></blockquote>Or, you're the freakin' scum RoleBlocker and KNOW Jily was blocked.<br><br>Additionally, the wording of this: <blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I wouldn't know if jily had used her shot or not unless I was a tracker, watcher, or jily.<br><br>I think that it is no big assumption to think that jily had used her shot. And if it hadn't gone through, then it's also no big assumption to think that a roleblocker is afoot.</div></blockquote> ...Implies that Ald thinks (or KNOWS) that Jily is town and therefore not lying, whereas...<br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Also, jily is scummy. If she isn't then address what I've said against her.</div></blockquote> THIS reaffirms that Ald thinks Jily is scum. (No, wait, worse. Ald thinks Jily is scum<span class=\"noboldsig\">my</span>. That's ten times worse, because it leaves him the chance to back out at any time by saying, \"scummy, but not scum\".)<br><br>Speaking of which. Ald's suspects have been from what I see, Captain, Alex, and Jily.<br><br>Easy mislynch targets for the lose!<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Err, DY has done basically the same thing and you obviously think that lines like mine did come from town.</div></blockquote>Different subjects. I agreed with you on a point about the Night. I agreed with Yoshi on a suspect. The two are COMPLETELY different things to agree with.<br><br>You trying to tie these entirely different things together makes you even more scum.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>No. Not in this post.</div></blockquote>But you HAVE been trying to get Alex lynched!  <blockquote><div><cite>You, in that very same wall wrote:</cite>BTW, since alex isn't happening</div></blockquote> (Speaking of that, Ald's wording implies he knows Alex is town already.)<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Shrug.

YOU CAN CHANGE YOUR VOTE ANY TIME BEFORE A LYNCH!<br>The ONLY reason to be afraid of making a poor, less-informed vote, is that you're scum who fears they'll have to backtrack out of the vote later.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>It sounds like you only saw the towniness after you came to the conclusion that DY was town. Maybe you should try reading my posts with the idea that I'm town and see what comes up.</div></blockquote>I did. I came up with...well, nothing. I saw nothing positive in a town-Ald. I saw nothing which looked like I could praise you for. I had to fight, hard, to make a universe where Ald was town exist. And it collapsed the second I stopped trying.<br><br>You're scum. You're overdefensive, opportunistic, lurky, walling, anti-town scum. (I meant it when I said, I really see the old scum-Mastin when I look into Ald.)<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>My defense is rather condemning?</div></blockquote>Yes. You dig your hole deeper every time you post. Even if Captain is mislynched today, you're not going to escape forever, Ald. You might've manipulated a few people into thinking you're not scum, but when Captain flips town, their viewpoint will collapse. They will realize, \"...Maybe Mastin wasn't so Mad afterall.\" They'll look at you, and look at me, and realize, I was right and they will be ashamed that they were fooled by your hollow see-through defense.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>You know, Occam's Razor applies when one possibility requires less assumptions/the assumptions are fairly like to be true.</div></blockquote>It's not less assumptions. It's simpler assumptions. Compare mine to yours.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Lots of normals?</div></blockquote>Exclusively normals. And limited-shot vigs are incredibly common. While we didn't know it to be the case, you can look at Desert Mafia for an example--the Delayed Action Vig was two-shot. One instance of many. You can also look at Oldy Mafia, which had a limited-shot vig. The role is on the uprising, and is incredibly common.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>If so, what makes you think that you haven't just encountered a large number of 1-shot vigs or something?</div></blockquote>Occam's Razor. Which is more likely?<br>That I've seen an abnormally large number of 1-shot vigs, that I've seen lots of people favoring their usage all across the site and that it never actually gets put into practice?<br>...Or that they actually are on the rise and becoming incredibly common?<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Well, of course he will if I flip scum.

The play overall is a perfect match.)<br><br>There's probably more I could find, but I'm kinda lazy. Alex has been showing consistent scumhunting. He has extremely favorable interactions. His motive seems consistently town. His biggest thing in his favor is tone, which is consistently town. He has lots of town-tells, and overall is a pretty town player."}

This VC is focused mostly on Ald and WK, and they yield some significant townreads.  This is a bit of a wall, but hopefully an informative one.<br><br>#5: WK is voting Ironhead, Alduskkel is voting me.  In both cases are scum voting players that everyone else should have on strong townreads by this point (in my case, I would cite Mastin's argument on his own behalf--unless you think I was executing a double-bus on D1, I'm town.)<br><br>#7: WK is voting Jily (this be about the time jily was screaming 'easy lynch,' and we now know she is who she said she was.  (PS: Jily, welcome to my modding blacklist.)  Ald isn't voting.<br><br>#9: Ald's vote goes back to me, WK's goes back to Ironhead.  Since the two known scum have shown a reluctance to bus early, this should almost completely clear Ironhead as well as myself.  Additionally, and this is important--Spitfarvle (who will be replaced by Soben) is the only vote listed on WK.  Given that the other two scum aren't bussing, I have to think that Spit was town, unless he simply didn't get the no-bussing memo.  <span class=\"noboldsig\">Mastin, this means that Soben is probtown.  You should remove your vote.</span><br><br>#12: Ald's vote goes to CC--given what I note just above, this is actually a strong point in favor of CC being town, because Ald hadn't bussed yet, and it would make no sense for him to try to gin up a wagon on one scumbuddy in order to try to divert attention from the current wagon on the other buddy.  CC is almost certainly town, Mastin was correct on that one.<br><br>#17: WK is at L-2, and Ald still hasn't bussed, which to me says his vote on WK was more a last resort, and in any case, the WK wagon at this point has two confirmed town (jily and SP) and three obvtown (me, Ironhead, Mastin).  WK moves vote to SP, a player we now know is town, so bussing still isn't something scum seem willing to do for towncred.<br><br>#26: Brokenscraps (to become TS) hops on the WK wagon.  This *could* be a bus if broken replaced in, saw a buddy in danger, and felt the need to reap immediate towncred.  But I think TS's entry into the game is townish, so on balance, that slot is fairly nullish now.<br><br>#27: Here's why Broken's vote looks like a bus--he immediately jumps off to join the TWIE wagon--makes sense for a scum if they see a possibility for an alternate wagon.  This hypothesis would mean Xvart in TWIE's spot is town, and TS is scum.<br><br>#29: At this point, Ald goes for the bus, and I do think he is the only scum on the final WK wagon.  As for the TWIE wagon, it is worth noting that WK does not change his vote to the rival wagon in an effort of self-preservation, which is a scumpoint to Xvart.  If the TWIE wagon is in fact scumdriven, it was probably by broken/TS or alex, but alex looks more town on D2 than he did on D1.<br><br>At the time of the final D1 VC, the possible scum candidates to me are (excluding Ald): Elsa, Broken, Alex, and Xvart.  On to D2...<br><br>D2, #50: Ald waits for a long time to vote, but eventually decides on Alex.  Given Ald's reluctance to bus on D1, this is a townpoint for Alex.<br><br>#55: Ald moves from Alex to CC--smacks of self-preservation, but as I noted earlier, CC is probtown now.<br><br>The D1 lynch wagon consisted of: Mastin2, jilynne1991, Alduskkel, Ironhead, Darth Yoshi, Secret Project, Soben.  Two confirmed town and one confirmed scum.  I believe the rest of the players on this wagon were town, and that the third scum was off the WK wagon.<br><br>The D2 lynch wagon consisted of: Mastin2, Twistedspoon, Wiredalexv, Darth Yoshi, Xvart, CC.  No confirmed town or scum, BUT it gives us a player who was on neither lynching wagon: Elsa.  Her scumminess is compounded by the reality that despite her back and forth with GK and Alex, neither Ald nor WK ever really suspected her.  I'm pretty sure she's the final scum.  Even if I'm wrong, I think the town has this in the bag and can find the final scum pretty easily through PoE because there are too many probtown players for the scum to handle with NKs.<br><br>tl;dr:<br><br>Strong townreads (aka I will fight tooth and nail against their lynch): Ironhead, Mastin, Soben, CC, Alex, and me (duh).<br>Null, maybe null-leaning-town: TS, Xvart<br>Scum: Elsa<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: Elsa.</span>"}

RL got in the way of posting during D-2, and it was difficult to keep up a VT facade with the discussion going on during that phase. Mastin2's contribution definitely threw a curveball. Normally I would have been happy to let him drive the discussion, but his insistence that you were scum was problematic. I had just investigated you, but how to disabuse him of his scum-read on you without implying too strongly that I was the cop?

But ultimately I just wanted one of my potential investigation targets dead, so either one of them would work for me and I could just investigate the other one during N-2. But when Alduskkel flipped scum, I figured Captain Corporal was low-probability to be his remaining partner (their competing wagons on D-2 were different from TWIE's and WK's on D-1).<br><br>During the N-2 phase I wasn't sure who I would be investigating. I didn't want to investigate Captain Corporal at that point, so I figured maybe Elsa? I actually wrote her name in the PM to the GM, thought it over, and then deleted it before clicking send. I figured she would be likely to be a top lynch candidate and if my investigation revealed that she was innocent I didn't want to have to defend her. Also, with Xvart just replacing in I figured some players may give him a pass for a few days, so I typed in Xvart and clicked send -- figuring if he comes back innocent then he will be much easier to defend from a lynch."}

From a neutral perspective, I would have been all over Secret Project from the get go so I was planning on that and didn't realize (despite being told) that Secret Project was dead.

Your concern over my scumread on you was pretty much the most scummy thing you could have done. I might've had some influence, but I wasn't the strongest town leader and there were multiple foils for me this game: you, Yoshi, and Ironhead, mainly.

And I likely would have.)<br><br>That said, there's no guarantee that it'd stop your lynch. It'd be a massive gambit to get the town to simply ignore me, and would obviously convince me further (rather than less) that you were scum--it's just that if pulled off successfully, I'd be made to look like a crazy lunatic and you'd be seen as the voice of reason.<br><br><br>A more reliable way would've been to focus on suspects.
