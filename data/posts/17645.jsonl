I am Substrike22, and I will be your moderator for the next few months.  As this is a mini normal game, there will be minimal flavor, and any flavor will be \"vanilla\" and will not contain any relevant game information.  ANY flavor included is included purely by the fact that I am a creative writer and occasionally like to find creative ways to tell stories.  A game of mafia, underneath it all, is a story unfolding.  Therefore I may stage a game in given setting, but this setting will not have any impact on the game itself, other than providing imagry and a plot for you to enjoy.<br>\n<br>\nBelow are my rules.<br>\nRules:<br>\n1.  Rule one of mafia.  You don't talk about mafia.<br>\n2.  No land wars in Russia.<br>\n<br>\nReal rules:  <br>\n(Copied and edited from Reckamonic, with their permission.  Original set of rules belonged to Vi.)<br>\n<br>\n1) <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Starting and Ending States:</div>  The game starts during the Day.  All roles that can communicate at Night may do during pregame, but not during the day, unless otherwise specified in your role PM.  (If this is a normal game, there will be no day quicktopic.  Period.)  The game will end when one faction has fulfilled its win condition, unless otherwise specified.<br>\n2) <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Day Procedures:</div>  Each player may discuss the game and cast a single vote at a time against people they want to lynch.  Day ends when either the deadline hits or a strict majority of the votes are on one person.<br>\n3) <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Voting:</div>  Votes should be in <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">bold</div> AND AT THE START OF A NEW LINE in order for them to count, for instance: <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: Substrike22</div>.  <br>\n<br>\nIf you wish to vote for a different player, it helps the mod if you unvote, but is is not required.  As long as I can tell who you're voting for, I don't care if you abbreviate someone's name when you vote them.<br>\n4) <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">No Lynch:</div>  As an alternative to voting for someone, you may <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: No Lynch</div>, but for it to take effect, enough players must vote No Lynch that it would be impossible to form any other majority.<br>\n5) <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Deadlines:</div>  Deadline will be 3 weeks.<br>\n6) <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Mass Inactivity:</div>  I may shorten the deadline if I deem the activity level is unsatisfactory. You will be warned if I  want you fellows to pick up the pace.<br>\n7) <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Deadline Lynches:</div>  If no single player has enough votes for a lynch at the deadline, the result is <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">No Lynch</div> and the game proceeds to Night.  Deadlines are there for a reason.<br>\n<br>\n8) <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Twilight:</div> After someone receives the majority vote, everyone may still discuss the game, but votes and unvotes will not be considered - the person voted for by the majority will be lynched regardless. Twilight will last until we waltz in and post a death scene.<br>\n<br>\n9) <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Night Length and Procedures:</div>  The topic will be locked at Night.  If your Role PM specifies that you have a Night Action, you may follow the instructions on that PM to use it. Barring extenuating circumstances, Nights will not last longer than 72 hours, but will not be shorter than 48.<br>\n10) <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Night Action Resubmission:</div> If you have to PM a choice to the mods (i.e. the name of someone you want to kill/protect/investigate), you may change your choice at any time during the Night by sending the mod another PM with the new choice.  The most recent choice will be honored.  Note, if you change your mind, your place \"in line\" for rule 11 is also reset.<br>\n11) <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Role Overlap Policy:</div>  In the event of overlapping and/or contradictory Night Actions (i.e. a mutual roleblock), priority is given to whoever PMs the mods with the action first. However, if two kills are submitted on the same target, the most damaging death will be the one displayed (You can slit someone's throat first, but if he got blown to smithereens no one will care about his throat...). Finally, if two vote modifying actions affect you, the lower amount takes priority.  <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">If this is a non-theme game, note that the flavor involved with a death doesn't actually matter, and therefore I will defer to the order in which the kills are submitted, not the death that is \"most damaging.\"</div><br>\n<br>\n12) <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Bolding Stuff:</div>  Bolding something is how you get the mod to notice it.  It's that simple.  I will not read text that is not bolded.<br>\n13) <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Mod Color:</div>  If the mod needs to edit your post, it will be done in <div style=\"display:inline;color:blue\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">blue,</div></div></div> italicized and bolded.  Don't impersonate me.  This is modkillable.<br>\n14) <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Activity, Prods, and Replacements:</div>  You will be prodded if three days have passed since your last post.  You will be replaced if you do not post after another two days, or if you need to be prodded three times throughout the game.  If you know ahead of time that you will not be able to participate for at least 48 hours, go ahead and announce it in-thread so nobody (such as <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">the mod</div>) thinks you're lurking.  We reserve the right to blacklist flakers or people who maliciously replace out.<br>\n15) <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">\"Last Words\" for replacements:</div>  If you request replacement, you may PM me a message that you would like to have passed on to the person who replaces you.<br>\n16) <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">\"Bah!\" Posts:</div> If your player slot is killed off, it's probably because people don't want you around. Unless your role specifically states you can keep talking/voting/play parcheesi with us, you are allowed one informationless \"bah\" post and then scram til endgame. Special mechanics can of course overlap.<br>\n17) <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Outside Discussion:</div>  Don't discuss this game outside of this thread with anyone unless your Role PM lets you do otherwise.<br>\n18) <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Post Edition:</div> Editing or deleting posts is not allowed (and usually not possible).  Doublepost with your changes instead.<br>\n19) <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Mod and PM quoting:</div>  You may not, at any time, quote your role PM.  If you do, you will be modkilled, and your faction will be significantly penalized.  If, at any point, a quicktopic is shared, everyone in that quicktopic will be modkilled to preserve the integrity of the game.  This includes Masons, Mafia Members, or other factions.  This means that if, for any reason (accidental or malicious), a Mafia quicktopic is posted, the Mafia will be modkilled and lose the game.<br>\n20) <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Modkills:</div> Breaking any of the above three rules (or flagrantly violating Rule 16) will result in you getting modkilled.  Modkills can be retroactive.  If a living player breaks any of these rules, the day may or may not end, depending on what would disadvantage that player's faction the most.  A dead player breaking any of these rules will result in someone from the same faction getting modkilled.  In addition, getting modkilled results in an instant loss for that player, along with my general hatred. In short, follow the rules.  I will keep a blacklist.<br>\n<br>\n21) <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Win Mentality:</div> Play to win.  Failure to do so will result in rule 20 being used.<br>\n22) <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Policy:</div> Have fun.  Or else.  And remember, it's a game - keep it classy and don't take things personally; everyone's doing what they have to to win.", "time": "Mon May 30, 2011 5:46 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=17645&start=0", "forum": "53", "thread": "17645"}

You get a few good reads, and it generates enough discussion to get the game going.</div></blockquote><br>\nI concede that it does get the game going; and you could get a few good reads. But this is a problem -- you only get <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">a few</div> good reads. RVS is not random for the scum (and not terribly random for the town, if players are choosing who to vote based on who does or does not have an impending bandwagon on them). Because the scum know who their partners are, they can steer the momentum of RVS away from their partners and toward townies. They can thus avoid having to answer to the pressure of a D-1 bandwagon; or, they can ensure that they or their partner endures an early D-1 bandwagon, just so they can point to that for town-credibility, but then re-direct the bandwagon momentum onto someone else. The point is, the uninformed town can be manipulated by the scum without even knowing they are being manipulated; and even those being bandwagoned early on can know that it is only RVS and that they should not worry too much. The reads you end up getting may not be good, and they almost certainly will be limited to the few who actively participated in RVS (by either enduring a bandwagon or taking a stand on someone else's bandwagon).<br>\n<br>\nI prefer RQS because the underlying assumption is that everyone has to answer the questions. Everyone participates and gets their responses and opinions out in the open, and no one can avoid having to take an early stand on some semi-relevant question.<br>\n<br>\nRVS and RQS are not mutually exclusive, and most games with an RQS element will also have some degree of RVS. And early votes in RQS are fine, as long as there is a modicum of justification beyond simple bandwagoning. The questioning in RQS is supposed to provide that modicum of justification. This is why RVS is bad vis-a-vis RQS, in my opinion.", "time": "Wed Jun 01, 2011 1:57 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=17645&start=75", "forum": "53", "thread": "17645"}

I think RQS generates more useful discussion than RVS -- besides, not everyone gets pressured during RVS.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nNow look at this. Aggressive and he tries to put himself in a position above you. I've noticed that confidence is one of the best ways to seem town. This is bad acting. An attempt to sound like he knows exactly what he's talking about. And for everyone besides krew, take a look at the end of it. Attacks krew's post for 4 lines and then says \"oh but you're not scummy for anything here.\" He's scared to bus his scum buddy back, and possibly not sure how to react to being bussed.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Ironhead wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>SleepyKrew wrote:</cite>So, I'm thinking Iron/jil team? I personally want to see Iron go first.</div></blockquote><br>\nYou sure don't think too much of me, do you? I have asked you to explain your failure to follow my logic (please review post #68) and you have not only ignored it, but you continue to obfuscate. You are not acting in the best interests of the town. If you wish to exercise the town's power to lynch, it is incumbent upon you to demonstrate a strong reason. Saying \"I personally want to see Iron go first\" is not a compelling reason.<br>\n<br>\nI am a stickler for unimpeachable logic (as splitfarvle can attest, as we just finished a game together). If you are going to sling faulty logic through this game, I will identify it as garbage for you. Poor logic in itself is not a definitive scum-tell, but it is not pro-town.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nAnd finally, here he continues his \"I have a degree\" mode with another wannabe elite post. You'd think the guy is a hydra with how different he talks in consecutive posts <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":roll:\" title=\"Rolling Eyes\"> <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Ironhead wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>wierdalexv wrote:</cite>@Ironhead: What's so bad about it? You get a few good reads, and it generates enough discussion to get the game going.</div></blockquote><br>\nI concede that it does get the game going; and you could get a few good reads. But this is a problem -- you only get <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">a few</div> good reads. RVS is not random for the scum (and not terribly random for the town, if players are choosing who to vote based on who does or does not have an impending bandwagon on them). Because the scum know who their partners are, they can steer the momentum of RVS away from their partners and toward townies. They can thus avoid having to answer to the pressure of a D-1 bandwagon; or, they can ensure that they or their partner endures an early D-1 bandwagon, just so they can point to that for town-credibility, but then re-direct the bandwagon momentum onto someone else. The point is, the uninformed town can be manipulated by the scum without even knowing they are being manipulated; and even those being bandwagoned early on can know that it is only RVS and that they should not worry too much. The reads you end up getting may not be good, and they almost certainly will be limited to the few who actively participated in RVS (by either enduring a bandwagon or taking a stand on someone else's bandwagon).<br>\n<br>\nI prefer RQS because the underlying assumption is that everyone has to answer the questions. Everyone participates and gets their responses and opinions out in the open, and no one can avoid having to take an early stand on some semi-relevant question.<br>\n<br>\nRVS and RQS are not mutually exclusive, and most games with an RQS element will also have some degree of RVS. And early votes in RQS are fine, as long as there is a modicum of justification beyond simple bandwagoning. The questioning in RQS is supposed to provide that modicum of justification. This is why RVS is bad vis-a-vis RQS, in my opinion.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Scum: Ironhead<br>\nWeirdalex<br>\nkrew (Jil as alternate if it's not krew)</div><br>\n<br>\nCool, good game.", "time": "Wed Jun 01, 2011 11:51 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=17645&start=100", "forum": "53", "thread": "17645"}

If you can find a definition of Appeal to Logic that says it \"is NOT by definition well-constructed or free from error, it just needs to be an attempt at manipulation of others' thought processes,\" then share it with us. I think any definition you find is going to validate the definition I offered.<br>\n<br>\nFurthermore, <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">all</div> arguments are an appeal to the listener in some way. The arguer is appealing to the listener to accept the conclusion being argued. A solid argument appeals to the listener's sense of logic; hence, Appeal to Logic (a=b, and b=c, thus a=c). If the arguer appeals to the listener's sense of emotion, it would be an Appeal to Emotion (a=b, and b is ridiculous! Thus, a=c). If the arguer appeals to the listener's sense of authority, it would be an Appeal to Authority (a=b, and Barack Obama says that b=c!

Secret Project is accusing you of shifting over to more refined/sophisticated posting to seem more pro-town. He calls it \"Appeal to Logic\" which is a terrible name in my opinion.</div></blockquote><br>\nAn \"Appeal to Logic\" isn't a term Secret Project just coined. It is an expression with an already well-established definition. I gave Secret Project the opportunity to correct his definition and/or refine his accusation against me; in other words, he could have said what you just said (\" shifting over to more refined/sophisticated posting to seem more pro-town\") or to what WormyKrew said earlier (\"Iron is trying to <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">appear</div> as if he's being logical, and using this appearance to manipulate us\"). He chose to continue with his original assertion. Therefore, I think I understand the case on me pretty well. It is bogus, and is a possible indication that Secret Project's scum-hunting is bogus.<br>\n<br>\nTo press the point on Secret Project's scum-hunting; his level of aggression is fine, as it would certainly produce pressure on scum. But he is far too indiscriminate -- if <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">everyone</div> is a suspect, then <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">no one</div> is a suspect. How are any of us supposed to feel pressure when he casts an accusation when there are (at last count) three other suspects whom he has indicted? But it certainly creates the <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">appearance</div> that he is a bold, hard-charging scum-hunter. There's just no substance to his argument. That, coupled with his bizarre exclamation that grouped everyone (including, presumably, himself) as a scum puts him head and shoulders above the crowd in terms of a level of suspicion.<br>\n<br>\nOne final point -- I think I have built a strong enough argument to invalidate your dismissal of my justification as simply OMGUS. If I responded to his vote on me by casting a vote on him without further justification, I think we would all agree that it was OMGUS. By disparaging the case I've built as OMGUS, you are disparaging the substance of the argument unfairly.

I believe this is an Appeal to Contradiction?<br>\nReads in a bit.<br>\n~Krew</div></blockquote><br>\nThis is a bizarre response. The issue of whether or not he is scumhunting is separate from the issue of whether or not he is AtEing. I contend that he is not scumhunting effectively, and he has AtE'd. Your response to this is no, he has not AtE'd (post #189) <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">because</div> he is scumhunting (post #191). This is a non-sequitur. And your defense of Secret Project seems to me to be unnecessary.<br>\n<br>\nAnd what the heck is an Appeal to Contradiction? Did you just make that up?<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Secret Project wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Ironhead wrote:</cite>It appears to me that Secret Project is being overly aggressive</div></blockquote><br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Ironhead wrote:</cite>his level of aggression is fine</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nThere's so much contradiction to his point it's striking. To be honest, the second post screams \"scum backpedalling\", hence the \"his level of aggression is fine, as it would certainly produce pressure on scum\". Then he brings up this:<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Ironhead wrote:</cite>But he is far too indiscriminate -- if everyone is a suspect, then no one is a suspect.</div></blockquote><br>\nA completely DIFFERENT point which was the most pathetic excuse for a slip I've ever seen in his original post on us is now a main point in the <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">scumhunting</div>? What?</div></blockquote><br>\nYou just answered your own point; in the first summation, I note that on the whole you are overly aggressive. On the second quote, I note that your level of aggression is fine, <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">but</div> you are too indiscriminate. You separated the second and third parts into two different quotes, and then incorrectly identified the third part as a \"completely DIFFERENT point\" when in fact it clearly linked to the second point. I thought it was pretty obvious that the third part (\"far too indiscriminate\") was integral to the argument being made in the second part (\"level of aggression is fine\") -- especially as he left out the clause linking the two parts: \"his level of aggression is fine, <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">as it would certainly produce pressure on scum</div>. But he is far too indiscriminate....\"<br>\n<br>\nBy leaving out that part, he built a straw-man argument by severing the second and third parts of the quote. I have now leveled justified accusations of Appealing to Emotion and Straw Man argumentation. I think these are enough to justify putting more votes on him. I also think Krew ought to let Secret Project defend himself, and not leap to his defense with faulty argumentation of his own.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Secret Project wrote:</cite>No, because you didn't listen the last time I said AtE isn't a scum tell in every context.</div></blockquote><br>\nI tried to listen when you brought this point up (post #149). In post #153 I asked you to point out where you told Krew that AtE isn't a scum tell in every context, because I couldn't find it on this board. Could you please point it out to me?

Yeah, right, like we'll stop giving scumreads.\" More or less. That's probably not the BEST way to word the counter-argument, but it's the first way I thought of.

I read this as \"I didn't filter out anything that might be scummy before I typed it, and I now regret typing it.\" This might be true, but it does not make you any less scummy. The only thing that might be pro-town is your alleged concern that DarthYoshi might be a PR, and so your willingness \"to just let it slide.\" But I'm not sure that even this is pro-town -- if DarthYoshi's response made you think that he might be a PR, then (a) others may have drawn the same conclusion, so it is too late to sweep it under the rug; and (b) your post really did operate as a rolefish, whether you intended it to do so or not.<br>\n<br>\nIn post #288, mastin2 indicates that he finds it unlikely that both hydras are town. I agree; but whereas mastin2 has focused on WormyKrew, I think Secret Project is the more likely of the two hydras to be scum, due (partly) to flaws I see in his scum-hunting and (mostly) to his fallacious responses to the accusations leveled against him. However, it is very easy for me to see WormyKrew as scum -- his buddying up to Secret Project and chainsaw defense of him come immediately to mind.

I think Ironhead is right in the argument.  This game is 100% about appeals to something. Appeals to logic, appeals to emotion, appeals to authority. All of those appeals can be used by BOTH scum and town. From Ironhead town pov, I can see him raging at Secret Project because from a quick read-through it looks like Secret Project is trying to \"fos him\" for appealing to logic, when in reality logic is the strongest part of the game.<br>\n<br>\nNow, I don't really blame Secret Project for pointing out appeal to authority as a possible \"scumtell\". I don't view it as much of a scumtell as I view it as something that would be dangerous for a scum-sided player to have. If scum can establish their authority early on it can cause lots of problems for town for obvious reasons. I feel that this was what he was getting at maybe? The arrogance/appeal to authority/whatever you want to call it is in itself a big fat null tell though.<br>\n<br>\nI think Ironhead vs Secret Project is very possibly Town v. Town and we shouldn't lynch either.<br>\n<br>\njilynne, essentially I believe you are town because I believe your newbie tells. People view your politeness and not wanting to pressure people as potential scum, but they are forgetting (or ignoring) the fact you are a teenage girl and your behavior very likely matches your personality. Derp. No offense intended. And yea, once you claimed it becomes even more obv that you are town.<br>\n<br>\nOn page 8, will post once ore on page 12 and then a recap.

I've played with a few of you in the past and it's nice to see some new faces as well. With the exception of my replace in and catch-up post we won't be posting separately, instead we will be discussing our thoughts in our QT prior to posting thus there will be no need to sign our posts. I know this post is going to seem unbelievably long however I urge everyone to read the entirety of it and state what they have agreement or disagreement with. <br>\n<br>\nThe amount of discussion based around the advantages and disadvantages of the RVS and the RQS in this game is appalling. Players thoughts and opinions on both of these would be decided before entering the game and recieving their role meaning their stances are unallignment indicative. Futhermore attempting to attack a player because of their ability to use English is infuriatingly bad, if you were to read through just one of Ironheads town games you will notice his use of language is highly similar thus not an allignment related tell. I also strongly dislike the fact that it's being pushed that at least one of the town hydras has to be scum due to interactions becuase it's not the case at all, the only thing that interactions between them show is that they're not scum together. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">I do need to hear from TheWayItEnds and Ironhead more before I can attain a read on any of them so: Ironhead and TheWayItEnds I want you all to state your thoughts on the WormyKrew wagon at the moment as well as if you feel it's scum or town propelled. </div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Town Reads:</div></div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Captain Corporal:</div>His predecessors actions before replacing out read as a geninue attempt at scumhunting and leaving information for his partner, Captains disagreement with his predecessors reads is something that mafia generally would avoid doing, as is openely asking for players reads and thoughts on their slot.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Secret Project:</div>The strength and aggression they showed about their reads earlier in the day reads as a geninue belief that they're correct. Their reaction to Jils claim and their actions following it is something I have massive trouble seeing them do as scum.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Wormy Krew:</div> I'm not seeing the case against them. The slip is semantics and is being pushed to the point where it's becoming a joke. Their hydra disagreements read as legitimate and there are many alternate places where they would place their vote as scum in this position. Their play also shows no ressemblance to Sleepys scum game, I suggest reading through <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=11&amp;t=17314\" class=\"postlink\">Newbie 1098</a> to notice the massive differences in his play. I do dislike the fact that they have quietened down recently and would like them to explain and move their vote.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Mastin2: </div>]I'm finding this read slightly difficult to explain, part of it has to do with Flinters actions however minimal they are the rest has to do with his prevention and redirection of the attention towards DY and Alduskkel which I really like.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Monk: </div>Similar to Mastin I'm finding this hard to explain and it's probably a read I will have to revist at some point but his most recent post mentioning a document going missing reads as a slight-town tell as keeping notes or documents about a game is something I generally do as town but not scum.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Null Reads:</div></div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Jilynne1991: </div>Something that should probably be brought to light is the fact that she's not a new player, she's an alternate account of another player at this site. Proof of this is <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3086580#p3086580\" class=\"postlink\">here</a> though you'll need to attain access to Forum 62 to read it. I'm reading her play this game as an overexaggeration of her false newbie status and if you read her 'town slip' knowing she's not new it reads as highly suspicious. I however am apprehensive over lynching her at the current moment due to her claim, I'm willing to leave her to the side until tommorow.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Alduskkel</div>: I intensely dislike his lack of content in this game especially for someone as experienced as he is, though I'm unsure if I would consider the lack of content a scum-tell for him especially considering he openely stated he prefers to be scum, therefore would be more inclined to perform better as it.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Scum Reads:</div></div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">WeirdAlex</div>: His play is exceedingly different to what I've seen from him in the previous game we played together and it's not because he's more experienced now, he's fencesat on nearly all of his suspicions and spent more time attempting to coach and assist Jilynne in the game than scumhunt himself. One thing I am positive on though is that if WeirdAlex or Jilynne ever flip scum the other is confirmed town.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">DarthYoshi</div>: Although he started the game very active his posts decreased in quantity and quality to the point where he voted Wormy to gain a reaction while saying he's aiming for a reaction in the same post as the vote. This removes the entire point of the pressure vote and reads as opportunistic voting. I do have one qualm about this read though, I've observed one of his previous scum games and from memory he played remarkably differently so this reads is certaintly open to change.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Elsa </div>: I don't doubt that she's busy due to university finals however I believe she's exaggerating how much of a hinderance that is on her performance in this game. A game just finished very recently in which she put forward a massive amount of effort to it in comparison to this game. She also contradicts herself by stating that she was most suspicious of both of the hydras however earlier in the game she stated she was fairly positive that Secret Project was clean (town).", "time": "Wed Jun 08, 2011 3:15 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=17645&start=475", "forum": "53", "thread": "17645"}

The difference in he play here compared to her linked town-game is massive. In this game she has shown willingness to lurk, sheep the leading wagon and refrain from stating alternate reads.

But I don't think you can accuse him of chainsaw defense for two important reasons: first, accusing him (or anyone) of chainsaw defense implies that the player being defended is scum. Until someone flips scum, that is a problematic conclusion to make. Second, it ignores the fact that you and Secret Project were teaming up to accuse me of scumminess early on as I built a case on Secret Project. If you can characterize Secret Project's current attack on you as chainsaw, then couldn't I do the same to characterize your attack on me when Secret Project and I were going at it?<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>WormyKrew wrote:</cite>Jily, this whole thing about you being an alt is... weird.

Based on the issues I mentioned above, I think your argument requires a little more work.

You are declaring that you have re-read the thread, and after re-examining the evidence have concluded that <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">the same person</div> is scum whom you have been accusing since the game started; I am unconvinced that you did a re-read with an open mind.

Scumhunter had been calling WormyKrew scum, and did a whole list of reads. Rather than comment on them at all, he commented on a small, insignificant detail.<br>\n<br>\nAdditionally, he disagreed with that one thing, but doesn't apparently disagree with Scumhunter's other reads, despite being scum. This is not as insane as you think, when you realized WormyKrew said, \"I like you\". That implies there's something to like in his posts, which implies a certain level of agreement (see my post for an example of this). And while he takes the time to say he disagrees specifically with ONE thing, he fails to disagree with the far more IMPORTANT thing on Scumhunter's views.<br>\n<br>\nThis \"looking town\" point is all you disagree with, then*? CONFIRM VOTE: WormyKrew!<br>\n<br>\n*I'll elaborate, but I'll see if anyone else can see this scumslip first.<br>\n<br>\nScumhunter, do you think you see the slip? (You'd be one of the people most likely to...)<br>\n^He was among the most likely, simply because he called them scum, and they didn't disagree.<br>\n<br>\nScumhunter got the line correct, but the emphasis wrong.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nWormyKrew wrote:@Scumhunter<br>\nHi. I like you. I disagree with your point on \"looking town\". <br>\nThe bolded, combined with the last sentence is what does it. Like I said, I can explain it, but I'm really hoping someone else sees it and can describe it in a more clear, concise way than Mastin-The-Rambler would.<br>\n<br>\nAs far as Regfan's initial reads go, I agree with some but not all of them. Notably, he relies on meta to excuse the behaviors of WormyKrew, and to prosecute the cases for Elsa and Alex, but in MY case, he excuses the meta away instead. Can't have it both ways, mate.<br>\n<br>\nAs for my drop in activity and quality of presence, if you go through my games played list, you'll see that coincided with me being in LyLo in two other games, and so this game definitely got pushed to the back burner for a little while.

Until someone flips scum, that is a problematic conclusion to make. Second, it ignores the fact that you and Secret Project were teaming up to accuse me of scumminess early on as I built a case on Secret Project.

It's probably town propelled for the most part, but I wouldn't be surprised if there were 1-2 scum on the wagon at some point.<br>\nThe other problem I'm having is that I'm pretty sure that mastin started pushing the WK wagon before WK posted his 'i like you \"<div style=\"display:inline-flex;text-decoration:line-through\">slip</div>\"',  meaning that I'm still missing out on the reason the wagon was actually started (which, if it exists, I would still be interested in).<br>\nI also don't like the slip, as I feel that liking a replacement for their posting, or their reads, or their X... means that you have to agree with everything that person has ever said.<br>\nI just got out of a game where one of my best townreads thought I was scum and we argued for much of the day... but I still liked (most of) his posting style and the way he generated activity.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nThis jily situation is interesting, I don't think that link proves shes an alt, but her flipping scum in a game leaves her \"what's a qt?\" as a point of suspicion rather than a \"townslip\" as it was called.<br>\nI'm still inclined to believe that (for the moment) she's prob town, because of the nature of her claim.  Because she claimed a limited use PR, if there were other players in the game that all had full use PRs they would all look at her claim with suspicion... But if they had limited use PR's they would be more inclined to believe that.<br>\nWait...Well would you look at that... shes now (almost) full claimed vig....  Which is a limited use PR that wouldn't really affect the ability of full use PR's in the game...

Not forceful guidance. \"Lolno\" (which is the tone I got on page 24) is forceful. Gently explaining things is better. Showing the newbie what they're doing wrong, in a \"this is wrong\" tone is terrible. It's absolutely horrible to them, one of the worst things they can feel, producing a sinking feeling in their chest as they're told their effort was for nothing. Explaining what they can do better is calmly guiding them in the right direction, gently trying to show them the way, rather than forcing it on them. If you gently prod them, their confidence level grows, as does their playing ability. If you forcefully push them down, then their confidence is shattered and it can take multiple games before they're even close to as confident as they were.<br>\n<br>\nTone is something I quite frankly know better than most people. I know many people's tones in their posts better than THEY do.

Worse, because the vets can't read Tone, most of them don't even REALIZE they're doing it. But it happens. All the time. And it's destructive. It wrecks a player for games.

If you want one, here you go:<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>WormyKrew wrote:</cite>If you think someone is town, you defend them, chainsaw or otherwise. It is SP who said a chainsaw is indicative of scum, and SP has chainsawed.</div></blockquote><br>\nThis comment shows a misunderstanding of what a chainsaw defense is. If a town thinks someone else is town, they might defend that player by addressing the accusations against him; they would not defend him by attacking his accuser (unless they think the accuser is scum, in which case the attack on the accuser is motivated by a scum-read and not by a defense of the town-read player).<br>\n<br>\nThe concept of the chainsaw defense is that a scum attacks another player because that player is accusing the scum's partner of scumminess. So the person making the chainsaw defense does not \"think someone is town\" as you say; he <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">knows</div> the alignment of the person being defended, and he knows that alignment is scum.<br>\n<br>\nUntil someone flips scum, we don't know if any one player's accusation on anyone else represents a chainsaw defense; so I am curious as to how you seem to know before any flips that what SP is doing is a chainsaw defense.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>WormyKrew wrote:</cite>Out of bounds? If jily is an alt, and considering the amount of games she's in, then she would probably be breaking site rules. It's worth a look IMO.</div></blockquote><br>\nYes, if she is breaking site rules then certainly an admin would want to get involved. This is something that an admin would have to do (not a mod, as jil suggested). And I think the correct procedure would be for a mod to discreetly notify an admin in a way that is invisible to us players and allows us to continue the game under the assumption that jil is not cheating.<br>\n<br>\nBut this is not what you suggested. You said \"Can't we ask an admin to do an IP check or something? Because if jily is new or not is very important.\" What you seem to be suggesting is that we players take it into our own hands to investigate this by contacting an admin and requesting an IP check so that we can confirm jil is scum. This is out of bounds.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>WormyKrew wrote:</cite>You tell me I re-read wrong. Then you tell me how to re-read properly. Well, let's see.<br>\nRe-question assumptions: Is mastin ever going to supply reasons?<br>\nNew arguments: Jily<br>\nStronger Argument: On you. My other scumspects all have a direct relation to you.</div></blockquote><br>\nYou bring up a good point about mastin2 (although in your post #526, your mention of mastin2 was almost an afterthought, after presenting weak cases on SP and jil). You don't offer much of a new argument on jil, but I think you are on the right track in terms of her being a suspect -- but checking her IP address is absolutely not a scumhunting technique. Your case on me is not a \"stronger argument,\" it is an appeal to possibility in that you discern a tenuous link between the two players against whom you have presented weak cases and me.<br>\n<br>\nI continue to be unconvinced that your alleged re-read yielded any new insights for you. It appears to me that you merely reinforced your opinions; that is why I didn't dignify your post #554 with a response until now.", "time": "Sun Jun 12, 2011 3:58 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=17645&start=625", "forum": "53", "thread": "17645"}

You seem overly concerned with how your voting is viewed.<br>\n<br>\nI&#8217;m still not getting the side-dish sort of focus on Jily.  We&#8217;re not lynching her today.  It&#8217;s that simple.  If she is what she says she is, her role is very easily confirmable.  If she isn&#8217;t what she says she is, we can throw her into death stew later on fairly easily.  (Side note, I think her observation about Capt Corporal in #540 is a decent one, especially since Corporal&#8217;s response in #542 is all kinds of awful&#8212;there&#8217;s nothing to push for, mate?

Whichever head wrote those words is the head I want answering that question; I don&#8217;t care if you two are split on him.<br>\n<br>\nWK&#8217;s #554-56 look more like a player attempting to appear helpful than a player who is, you know, actually being helpful.<br>\n<br>\nMastin&#8217;s #559-61: Please explain why you can&#8217;t support the Elsa wagon (ie, why is Elsa town?) <br>\n<br>\nWK&#8217;s #564: It&#8217;s called buddying.<br>\n<br>\nCorporal&#8217;s #566: How about actually responding to Mastin&#8217;s content as opposed to stating, basically, fluff?<br>\n<br>\nJily&#8217;s #573: Why is Alex leaning town to you?<br>\n<br>\nAlduskkel&#8217;s #582: Your response to me was an overreaction or overcompensation, imo.<br>\n<br>\nIronhead&#8217;s #594: How has Alex&#8217;s interactions with SP and Elsa demonstrated towniness?

Second, you came into the game with me as your #1 scumread, but now the only reason I&#8217;m scum is PoE?  WTF?  Also, PoE is at its weakest on D1&#8212;it becomes far more useful as the game progresses.<br>\n<br>\nTWIE&#8217;s #598 is&#8230;eh.

This post I see as being far more lengthy than his town-efforts in 1100&#8212;basically, he&#8217;s using six words a lot when only one or two will do.   Which may be a null tell for someone like, say, Mastin, but here, I&#8217;m not sure.  TWIE stays null for me, but I&#8217;m going to be watching him.

For the most part, the biggest thing that catches my eye seems like Krew flailing in his last few posts and switching to SP in an attempt to find any kind of purchase.

Plus his self-claimed nice theories/bad practice (theories aren't even real gosh darn) is really a skewed view when you have him preferring the mystic trust-me-on-this approach combined with things-are-not-what-they-seem/the-accused-are-innocent approach + the whole newbie intuition worship. <br>\n<br>\nAll just words to clothe a man who never was an philosopher but was in fact a seer.

Like attracts like? Because he definitely supports the prime mess of jilynne for sharing the newbie moon logic. <br>\n<br>\nMoon logic because the connection between \"I'm town\" to \"I'll be faking these aspects of myself\" seem bent. I'm taking jilynne as town for now at least mostly almost totally because of the claim, but also because of the targeting she had received for some non-scummy things; doesn't cause absolutes but it helps lowers those probabilities from where I'm standing. But there is a messy mental structure that leads to the self-admitted semi-deceptions and personality falsifications engaged in by jilynne being used for pro-town purposes. \"I'm genuinely that newbish, but I'm not genuinely that lost or confused\" = the question asking routine is a ruse? For what end? NK-proofing? Lost sheep meta? Has used the thread largely as a conversation board which makes actual motivation searches come up empty. <br>\n<br>\nOf course some players have put great emphasis on their clean tells and logic. They are not magic spells. Turning disputes over scumminess into disputes over which magic spell is best and then applying the winner to your chosen victim is a certified scum method of scum hunting.

I was put off by his jousting partner Secret Project starting right off from the beginning as well. Which leads me to wonder how some of you folks got strong town reads on them early on, most namely WormyKrew, who despite their vote on and apparent suspicion towards Ironhead manage to find town-positive actions in the largest pointless disputes and commentary that characterize his early play. Their expression, application and holding of early views on jilynne strike me as forced and scum style grasping. That's part of why I was okay with supporting a WK wagon, plus general scum vibes.

Just that jilynne's laziness (not wanting to \"rewrite 5 sentences\") is apparently a scum tell. With WormyKrew and Secret Project already expressing suspicion and jilynne being a player who very obviously won't be able to defend herself well, this is scummy as hell.<br>\n<br>\nwierdalex does the same thing in 92, except that it's worse because it's sheeping what TWIE said* (meaning that weirdalex is managing to add even less to the case than TWIE's nothing) and he's the 4th person to express suspicion of jily as opposed to the 3rd.<br>\n<br>\n*As DY notes in 101.<br>\n<br>\n96: WormyKrew reconsiders his suspicions on Ironhead a bit, switches to voting jilynne. But he had expressed previous suspicion (he was the 2nd to do so, I believe) and expands the case making this not a bad vote.

Really confusing actually. The chainsaw defense refers to scum <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">defending</div> a scumpartner by attacking their attacker. I mean, if WK is scum, and Ironhead is scum, then WK must be attacking Secret Project (the primary, if not the only, attacker of Ironhead at the time), right? Except he's not. Does not compute. I even checked WA's posts (WA being the other person SP called scum in post 104) for chainsawing, but there's nothing there.<br>\n<br>\n109: As noted in 152 by SP, bandwagony post from splitfarvle that doesn't add anything to the case.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>WormyKrew wrote:</cite>I've seen newbies \"townslip\" before.

I probably won't get into it much, but suffice it to say that Secret Project's case is/was weak (as I've said before) while Ironhead doesn't get that Secret Project was saying that the way/why Ironhead was appealing was scummy, not that appealing is in itself scummy.<br>\n---<br>\nPost 150 (Gerhard Krause) is still scummy, but I've talked about it before.

I will grant that WormyKrew and Secret Project were posting in between 199 and 210, but they didn't actually say anything new.

The fact that she scrapped it all thinking it wasn't needed should make you realize she was town who simply saw no need to post it.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Jily wrote:</cite>Well, I don't feel like typing it up again, so in a nutshell, I pretty much wrote the following:<br>\n<br>\nI don't like RVS either (meaing that although I like spectating, I don't like participating.)

(I'm sorry if I missed something, I probably did, but can someone explain the point of it anyways?) </div></blockquote>Reads as a town tone, this not understanding.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>TWIE wrote:</cite>RVS. Votes are info.</div></blockquote> I can't pin it down. (So call it Gut if you MUST, though this doesn't feel like gut.) But something in here makes this feel town, rather than null.

It doesn't have the slight condescending/scolding tone I'd expect from scum.

Rather than a rhetorical (slightly condescending) question.

Quite the opposite, I've never, EVER seen scum think this way. It's always town. Especially the bolded.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Iron wrote:</cite>4. I prefer RQS. It is too easy for scum to fly under the radar in RVS, because of course their votes are not random.</div></blockquote> This methodical approach to the game seems like a town take on things. Iron was essentially advocating equal pressure on all players, which RQS generates. Equal pressure--&gt;equal attention on all players--&gt;scum can't slip under the radar. In other words, Iron was quite logically deducing that the best strategy for the town was the RQS.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Why must RVS result in bandwagons? Couldn't it proceed with an approximately equal distribution of votes among several candidates?</div></blockquote>This furthers the above, in that Iron wanted equal distribution, equal pressure applied, rather than focusing on a single player via bandwagoning.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>By the way, I hate unjustified bandwagons -- another way for scum to fly under the radar.</div></blockquote>To Iron, everything must have a reason behind it. And if the reason is invisible, Iron can't analyze it. And therefore, to Iron, it looks bad. This shows a town thought process, in that he's trying to make sense of the game.<br>\n<br>\nAlso, since this is not the first time I've worked on an Ironhead is Town case, my notes from last time:<br>\n(Abandoned due to Scumhunter Rendering it pretty unnecessary, but still...)<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Mastin wrote:</cite>Equal distribution. I don't know about you, but to me, this sounds like a logical approach to the game: balance things out equally, rather than tip the scales towards one person. (A bandwagon.)<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Iron wrote:</cite>I thought I made the connection pretty solid between what wierdalex said and what the implication is. Are you indicting the connection? If so, where exactly did I fail to connect the argument to the conclusion?</div></blockquote>Key word usage here. \"Connect\". Multiple times. In this context, it's very strong.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I think RQS generates more useful discussion than RVS -- besides, not everyone gets pressured during RVS.</div></blockquote>This makes logical sense, since Random Votes for Random Reasons are difficult (some say impossible, though I disagree) to decipher, whereas Random Questions and Answers are comparatively easier to figure out. It also creates a valid point about pressure, again bringing up the logical, \"balanced\" view from Ironhead.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I have asked you to explain your failure to follow my logic (please review post #68) and you have not only ignored it, but you continue to obfuscate. You are not acting in the best interests of the town. If you wish to exercise the town's power to lynch, it is incumbent upon you to demonstrate a strong reason. Saying \"I personally want to see Iron go first\" is not a compelling reason.<br>\n<br>\nI am a stickler for unimpeachable logic (as splitfarvle can attest, as we just finished a game together). If you are going to sling faulty logic through this game, I will identify it as garbage for you. Poor logic in itself is not a definitive scum-tell, but it is not pro-town.</div></blockquote>This quote shows both his firm devotion to putting logic back into scumhunting, along with prodding WormyKrew somewhat, testing them, to get a feel for whether they're just anti-town playstyle, or anti-town role. (In other words, scumhunting.)<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>The point is, the uninformed town can be manipulated by the scum without even knowing they are being manipulated <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[*snip*]</div> and no one can avoid having to take an early stand on some semi-relevant question.</div></blockquote>When this is combined, you end up getting a solid town-read from Iron. It's hard to explain. Like it only comes from a town perspective. I'm trying to figure out an explanation for it. It's just a thought process, a thought pattern, a kind of Motivation (I suppose) that only comes from town.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Alex wrote:</cite>Was that a serious [pregame] vote (I mean, it won't count, but is it with the intent of voting me when the game starts)?

His curious attitude doesn't read in this post to me as being scum.

There's no Weasel Wording. No, \"so far\" after \"been\". Nothing to suggest that it's changed in this game. If it had changed, I'd expect something like \"Up to this point, all I've been\", or \"All I've been so far is\", \"all I've been previously is\", \"All I have been is\", \"All I have been in the past\", etc. Something like that, if it weren't the case right now.<br>\n<br>\nI didn't see that.

It's something a pro-town player would think of, though. It also gives off the town tunnel vibe, rather than the scum tunnel vibe. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Elsa wrote:</cite>Town, easily.

She's V/LA and would have more pressure. She's V/LA and would know that'd mean she'd appear to be lurking.<br>\n<br>\nShe's V/LA and doesn't want to get out, so she must be having fun.<br>\n<br>\nSee where this is going?<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Elsa wrote:</cite>Hah, I had no idea that votes were not counting yet.

There's a huge difference between \"playing bad\" and \"scum\". <br>\n<br>\nBy stating \"Jily is playing really bad\", WormyKrew has effectively scumslipped, in revealing they think Jily is town, playing bad, not scum. See how that works? <br>\n<br>\nIt wasn't \"Jily is anti-town\". Voting someone anti-town is a bit of a newb-mistake, but is mostly null. It wasn't \"jily is scummy\". That'd be scumhunting. It was, specifically, \"Jily is playing really bad\". <br>\n<br>\nSaying someone is Anti-Town makes no statement either way. It's neutral. Saying someone is scummy makes a statement that you think they're more likely to be scum (most frequently, anyway). <br>\n<br>\n\"Playing Bad\", on the other hand, has the OPPOSITE implication, that you think they're TOWN. And yet, they vote Jily, anyway. Hence, the scumslip.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Why would it matter in the first place if we were in pregame or not? You could've still posted your thoughts.</div></blockquote>This is the condescending scum Tone. Not the legitimately curious town tone.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Jil needs massive pressure</div></blockquote>This? This is a further admittance to knowing Jily is town. How? \"Massive Pressure\", rather than \"desperate need of rope\". It's just how town thinks. Town doesn't think, \"this person's scummy, so they need massive pressure\".<br>\n<br>\n They'll either think, \"Oh, this person needs some pressure VOTE: person\", or \"this person needs rope\". It's all in the exact wording. Details are vital, giving off a completely different feel to a post.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Alex wrote:</cite>Because I don't see what we would really get out of just voting everybody randomly.</div></blockquote>This creates a <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">possible</div></div> contradiction, in that Alex...voted randomly. (This is weak. Very weak.)<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I dunno why, TBH.</div></blockquote> This is another (extremely weak!) possible reason Alex could be scum: the fact that he voted Yoshi pre-game, but doesn't know why he did so when he knows it won't count. Creates a Yoshi-Alex link.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>The Mod wrote:</cite>DarthYoshi 3 (L-4) Wiredalexv, Alduskkel, Monk</div></blockquote>At this stage in the game, you'd kinda expect one scum there.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>It seems odd that Jily couldn't be bothered to write out 5 sentences. <br>\nSomewhat serious VOTE: Jilynne1991</div></blockquote>It's a bit concerning to see Alex bandwagoning, for a somewhat flimsy wagon, which reason isn't even that original.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Ald wrote:</cite>2.

When I made the post you're referring to, it was impossible to know that Jily was that weak of a player--this was way before her drawn-out role claim, ink vomit, and etc.  Additionally, I've long since changed my tune and have been adamant in saying that we aren't lynching Jily today, despite her \"easy lynch\" status.

In the former two cases, that means a mutual bus was in effect on D1, which might work in the instance of Alex, since we cross-voted relatively early, but certainly not in the case of Ald, where I was vacillating and working on a case on him for a long time--if I were scum, it'd be much easier to just bus him, knowing that I was right.  As for WK, note what I said to Mastin earlier in the game when he voted WK--why would Mastin vote for his #1 scumread's #1 scumread?  Because his #1 scumread is actually town.<br>\n<br>\nAll of that is to say (in the above paragraph)--Mastin tends to put a lot of emphasis on VC and association in his scumhunting, but if you go by association, the only possible partner who Mastin also suspected that might make a lick of sense would be Alex--except that I have had my vig vote parked on him for a while now, so I am clearly unafraid of him dying and potentially flipping scum.

Pulling out this old &#8220;cautious townie&#8221; card?  There&#8217;s two types of posting that I look for: genuine, sometimes-frank speak and dialogue that looks staged, mostly in an attempt to look townie.  This falls firmly into the latter and reads as someone trying too hard win townie points.  I don't think anyone was worried about this (SP hammering), or if they were, wouldn't bother saying it.  You're trying too hard.

I try to speak as frankly as possible in my games.

As such I am going to say, frankly, that a vote for me is a vote for a mislynch.  Simple as that.

{"number": 867, "id": "3147189", "user": "Secret Project", "user_id": "15908", "content": "monk slot case time!<br>\n<br>\nI'll start with monk posts. Unfortunately, I didn't see it when monk was playing but I can see it looking back at him. Of course there's the obvious bias I have in thinking brokenscraps is scummy so I'm inclined to look back and see his posts as scummy to back myself up.<br>\n<br>\nmonk iso 0: I read bits and pieces of mastin's Yoshi case and I think he overhyped the oddness of the way he thinks. It's different from what I've seen before but in no way is it weird, and it makes quite a bit of sense. Tone is always important. And look at mastin's criticism of Yoshi's tone in his RVS vote. monk's tone here is exactly the same. The vote is exactly the same. \"It's unnatural, artificial.\" (This is also why mastin will be more likely to be scum when brokenscraps flips scum)<br>\n<br>\niso 5: For some reason a lot of players feel like not having their vote on someone at all times is scummy. I consider it town play to have an extended period of time during any day where the player's vote isn't on anyone. It isn't necessarily scummy that monk placed a vote but the fact that he placed it before the game started and then confirmed it like it was serious when it's based on a forced joke about his profile name. Freaking terrible.<br>\n<br>\niso 9: People are always busy. There's always real life in the way. I'm no stranger to the \"hi, I'll catch up soon\" post, and it's certainly not a scum tell, but just the number I've seen of these from both players, there's 2 from monk and I wanna say 3 from brokenscraps. Including one specific one I've gotten to and will get to again. It's not necessary.  But in a game like this where (mastin is right) we've been mostly lurker hunting, there would be a drive for them, as scum, to remain active and not be seen as scummy because of lurking. Whether it's actually beyond their control or not (I don't believe anybody lurks to hide from the game), the fact that they both commented on multiple occasions to let us know they would be back soon looks like some subconscious (unintentional) need for approval from the town.<br>\n<br>\niso 10: It works with my other scum reads. Granted, the way brokenscraps reversed his predecessor's read on krew, I'm gonna say that if he's scum, krew is more likely to not be. We'll be lynching them both, of course, but still. mastin is MUCH more likely to be scum with brokenscraps, and alex, of course, is just scum with whoever's scum. scraps' level of noncommittal on alex is fun to watch.<br>\n<br>\niso 11 and 12: scumhunting as scum is hard, especially since people tend to make it so unnatural. monk is clearly having problems with scumhunting and resorts to lurker hunting early in the game before anyone else actually did it. I think scum have a problem with scumhunting because they know what is and isn't a scum tell. It's easy too fall back on fake but common ones such as lurking to sound as if contribution is actually happening. In actuality, monk didn't contribute a thing except that scum list that can be used to find his buddies on later.<br>\n<br>\niso 13: Said this before but how the heck does a document go awry?<br>\n<br>\nbrokenscraps iso 0 and 11: more of dat appeasing<br>\n<br>\niso 1: it scares me that nobody cared to mention how terribly scummy all around this post is. He doesn't even deign to comment on that vote in future posts. However, in iso 2 and 3 it becomes clear that he intends to follow monk's precedent in not actually scumhunting, just attacking lurkers. He puts a vig vote on alex but then says the EXACT (down to the same wording) same thing about elsa. I wonder why he chose to vig alex over elsa. His reads on them are apparently for nothing except their play being semi-lurky. Also, notice how absolutely sure he sounds on alex. Never again in his posts does he say anything as convinced as \"pretty obviously... scum\" as he does about alex's play here. It's common practice for scum to bus their weaker partner. Sounding right is VERY commonly misconstrued as sounding pro-town, so if alex were to flip scum, brokenscraps knows he'd get town points for this post.<br>\n<br>\np-edit: I take that back. He sounds so sure of himself one more time, which I'll get to in iso 6.<br>\n<br>\niso 4: more ridiculous focus on lurking. How is lurking scummy? Where is the scum motivation? This isn't scum hunting. Also he seems to be a fan of hopping on the leading wagons. Look at it. focuses on wormykrew when he comes in with a vig vote for alex, and mentions of elsa, then as the TWIE wagon picks up he's right on it. Each time it's for an accusation of lurking except in the case of krew which he couldn't think of a lie for since he's not lurking.<br>\n<br>\niso 6: Take a look at this<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>brokenscraps in iso 2 wrote:</cite>weirdalexv is pretty obviously a semi-lurking scum</div></blockquote><br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>brokenscraps in iso 6 wrote:</cite>Case on Wierdalex is clearly garbage. I don't need to explain why.</div></blockquote><br>\nOk now that looks bad, right? But it gets worse.

Then, they got the scum PM. Ear got worried, not liking to play as scum. Sleepy took over specifically because Sleepy likes being scum. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">We got the PM long before the switch. Sleepyhead is more active than earhead, hence the switch.</div><br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>VOTE: ironhead<br>\nWe both agree that his single post was scummy.

I must be scum for agreeing with someone.</div><br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Not liking RVS is obvscum.

There's a huge difference between \"playing bad\" and \"scum\". <br>\n<br>\nBy stating \"Jily is playing really bad\", WormyKrew has effectively scumslipped, in revealing they think Jily is town, playing bad, not scum. See how that works? <br>\n<br>\nIt wasn't \"Jily is anti-town\". Voting someone anti-town is a bit of a newb-mistake, but is mostly null. It wasn't \"jily is scummy\". That'd be scumhunting. It was, specifically, \"Jily is playing really bad\". <br>\n<br>\nSaying someone is Anti-Town makes no statement either way. It's neutral. Saying someone is scummy makes a statement that you think they're more likely to be scum (most frequently, anyway). <br>\n<br>\n\"Playing Bad\", on the other hand, has the OPPOSITE implication, that you think they're TOWN. And yet, they vote Jily, anyway. Hence, the scumslip. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Or if a scum player is extremely scummy, then they're also \"playing bad\".</div><br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Why would it matter in the first place if we were in pregame or not? You could've still posted your thoughts.</div></blockquote>This is the condescending scum Tone. Not the legitimately curious town tone. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">You know the answer.</div><br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Jil needs massive pressure</div></blockquote>This? This is a further admittance to knowing Jily is town. How? \"Massive Pressure\", rather than \"desperate need of rope\". It's just how town thinks. Town doesn't think, \"this person's scummy, so they need massive pressure\". <br>\n<br>\n They'll either think, \"Oh, this person needs some pressure VOTE: person\", or \"this person needs rope\". It's all in the exact wording. Details are vital, giving off a completely different feel to a post. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">What's the difference?</div></div></blockquote><br>\nCongrats mastin, great case.", "time": "Tue Jun 21, 2011 4:22 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=17645&start=875", "forum": "53", "thread": "17645"}

But otherwise, the rest of the case against him yesterday -- whether you consider it strong or weak -- stands as is.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nWell yeah, I <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">do </div>find it hard to believe that a scum team would pile on eachother's wagon on Day 1, as opposed to just starting up and supporting a wagon on a townie (which I think happened here).  As such, in this case, I do believe that Krew's flip does help out TWIE's town case (not that I really understood the TWIE case anyways).  That's why I'm baffled at alex's vote right out of the gate.  To go after TWIE right after the other wagon flipped scum makes little sense to me.<br>\n<br>\nAnd yeah, jily may be lying, but that's something to be addressed after alex's flip.  I said I wanted him or CC, and that has not changed (in fact it has been strengthened by WK's flip).<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: wierdalexv</div>", "time": "Mon Jun 27, 2011 6:50 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=17645&start=950", "forum": "53", "thread": "17645"}

The TWIE-wagon generated after players noted TWIE's scummy behavior. In other words, I don't think the TWIE wagon was ginned up by scum to reverse momentum on WK wagon. The WK wagon faltered in the middle of the day and only came on strong toward the end -- not enough time for scum to throw their weight behind a TWIE wagon. Therefore, I don't think there is anything to indicate that TWIE's wagon is indicative of town simply because WK flipped scum.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>mastin2 wrote:</cite>Third off: {Broken, Iron, Soben, Alex} contains EXACTLY one scum.

In this particular case it would rely on the strength of Wormys push on the TWIE wagon which was extremely weak.

It is also more townish than someone who knows for certain that someone will flip scum and cannot be perturbed about that scum-read throughout the day, and Soben was self-questioning throughout the day. An underlying theme to Soben's disagreement with the WK wagon is that he found valid reasons to disagree with it, as opposed to the normal scum tactic of grasping at straws to come up with reasons not to vote someone -- for example, the way he dismissed mastin2's case as incoherent. Also, there was apparently disagreement between the two heads of the hydra, which is indicative that at least half their mind did not accord WK a town read.

I don't want to be COMPLETELY useless before I get lynched/vigged/whatever, so I'm going to go back and look at WormyKrew a little bit.<br>\n<br>\nA lot can be found from dead scum's suspects, and as I appear to have forgotten this:<br>\nIronhead -- A <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3090558#p3090558\" class=\"postlink\">weak RVish vote</a> for 'avoiding RVS'.

Why WASN'T <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Soben</div></div> killed?!?\"<br>\n<br>\nBecause. Let's face it. On Day one--in order--the three least suspected players were Soben, myself, and Secret.<br>\n<br>\nSecret was third-least-suspected, and yet, got killed over myself, and Soben.<br>\n<br>\nThat left the burning question--why.<br>\nWhy wasn't Soben targetted?<br>\n<br>\nThere had been SERIOUS interest in a Secret lynch. Admittedly, most of the town (~75% of it, if I had to guess) had Secret as town. But there were a few, seriously calling Secret scum. And a lot of people (myself included!) had their town-read on Secret slightly diminish as the day went on.<br>\n<br>\nWhat made them such a fantastic nightkill? When there were at least two players less suspected? (As far as they knew, there was no way either myself or Soben would ever be lynched, due to how little support there was.)<br>\n<br>\nI bounced this thought around a little. And then I came to this. <blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Third off: {Broken, Iron, Soben, Alex} contains EXACTLY one scum. No more. If Alex isn't it, <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">I actually have a good idea of who it is.</div></div></blockquote> I wasn't sure. It DEFINITELY wasn't Iron. But {Broken, Soben, Alex} contained one scum. I had thought it to be Alex. But the contagion spread: what if it isn't him. What if he's actually town? Who would it be?<br>\nBroken or Soben.<br>\n<br>\nAnd the thought at the time was \"probably Soben, but it *could* be Broken...\" This thought lasted until Twisted came in. The \"alex is not scum\" thought still wavered, but evidence continued to grow. <blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>wierdalexv 3 (L-3) Darth Yoshi, jilynne1991, Elsa Von Spielburg</div></blockquote>Half-way to a lynch, in so little time, somewhat suspicious, to say the least.<br>\n<br>\nA dead giveaway that my thought process was changing? <blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>2. splitfarvie Scumhunter &lt;--Null, town-lean.<br>\nNULL: <br>\nAlex<br>\nSoben<br>\nBroken<br>\nAlex</div></blockquote> Soben was my strongest town-read day one. (Secret was at a close second, if memory serves.) And had suddenly dropped way back down to Null. (Albeit as a town-lean.) I was beginning to become forgetful of why I read Soben as town.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div> But I've got an idea in my head. An idea which refuses to die. I know, I hate it, but it happens.</div></blockquote> The idea was--of course--\"Soben is not the pro-town player you thought them to be...\"<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>But to answer your question. If I eliminated both you and Soben (trust me--I noticed you two were in both groups quite some time ago) from both groups, then that leaves Broken (a town-read) and Alex (a...well... ... ...yeah. <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\">) in that group, and Ald/Yoshi in the other.<br>\n<br>\nThose lists I posted, I know are on to something.</div></blockquote> This was another hint. In that I was very careful to make it clear that it was an \"if\" eliminating Iron AND Soben. (Iron, sure. If Iron's scum, he deserves a scummy nom as far as I'm concerned. <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\">) I also made it clear that Broken (town-read) was there, and Alex was not strong enough of a read to be confident in.<br>\nIn other words, \"I really can't eliminate Soben. Sorry. I just...can't.\"<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3168147#p3168147\" class=\"postlink\">978</a> was the first post Soben made since this read had developed. And...it made me think. \"...How did I get such a strong town-read on them?!?\" It continued with pretty much every post they made, dragging me further into the tunnel. More and more, I was beginning to think, \"You need to stop holding onto the dead Day1 town-read of Soben and see the truth.\" And from there, it got stronger.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>If I'm right, I DEFINITELY will not support an Alex lynch, for starters.</div></blockquote> ^That, for instance, was me basically augmenting the above by saying, \"I'm...not sure Alex is scum, anymore.\"<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Iron wrote:</cite>I thought that perhaps he was a scum playing it straight and trying to push TWIE as a straightforward alternative wagon to WK.</div></blockquote>And this certainly did not help.<br>\n<br>\nI need to do a re-read, because if I'm just being paranoid, this tunnel vision will be quite anti-town. But, there's always another option. That I wasn't wrong, after all. That Soben really IS scum, like most Day Two posts are saying to me.<br>\n<br>\nEssentially. I need to determine if what I did was Snap something into place (having abandoned my Dead Reads), make a magical realization which makes perfect sense...or if it's plain ol' tunnel visioning, paranoia about someone who is firmly town, with the early-play indeed being the town which I saw it as.<br>\n<br>\nSorry. It's now 2:20 am, here, so I'm not explaining it that well. I think I'm rambling right now.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nAddressing Twisted: That's another thing which is making me doubt Alex scum, as well as you.<br>\n<br>\nSince I predicted one scum in {Alex, Broken/You, Iron, Soben}, and you pointed out a townslip which might clear Alex, in addition to me having cleared Iron...<br>\n<br>\n...Well, let's just say that it's been spreading this Cancer just that much faster about Soben as Scum.", "time": "Fri Jul 01, 2011 10:22 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=17645&start=1025", "forum": "53", "thread": "17645"}

But with a townie, he is already acting town -- what \"slip\" could he possibly give that confirms this? To me, either the player's behavior is consistently town or he is a scum suspect to some degree. I don't buy into the idea of a single slip that suddenly confirms someone as town.<br>\n<br>\nIn the case of wierdalexv's particular alleged \"townslip,\" I see nothing that couldn't easily and predictably be feigned by a scum. I award wierdalexv no town-points for his comment.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>mastin2 wrote:</cite>You're forgetting. There were five names involved in the counterwagon.<br>\nOne was WormyKrew.<br>\nOne was SecretProject.<br>\nThe other three?<br>\n<br>\nAlex, Iron, and yourself.</div></blockquote><br>\nI didn't consider WormyKrew a part of the \"counterwagon.\" It seemed to me that he hopped on TWIE's wagon by default; TWIE was the next largest wagon and his justification was ending the day early.<br>\n<br>\nIt seemed to me that WK's participation in the TWIE wagon was after Soben and others had expended a lot of time and words discussing his perceived scumminess. If WK was looking for a counterwagon, he had other opportunities to push it. Furthermore, WK's ultimate demise was rather sudden and relatively unexpected; momentum was building on TWIE and he appeared to be heading for a lynch, and then very quickly the momentum shifted to WK. The timing and justification of WK's vote on TWIE do not appear to me to be a counterwagon.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>mastin2 wrote:</cite>Doubly wrong. It's not appealing to the majority. It's pointing out how multiple people believe it to be so, and therefore, it has a LOT of support. (Did I mention I've had scum use this exact fallacy against me recently? I was right--they were scum, and their 'fallacy' proved to be quite false.) AT LEAST four players have gotten behind the Yoshi/Ald containing one scum. Yourself included, with the scum between you being Ald, obviously.</div></blockquote><br>\nUnless your argument was \"it has a LOT of support,\" then it does appear to be an Appeal to Majority. My interpretation of your posting was that your argument was \"Ald and Yoshi contain one scum\" and your proof was \"believed by multiple players.\" This is a fallacious Appeal to Majority.<br>\n<br>\n...<br>\n<br>\nAs noted above, I believe wierdalexv's \"townslip\" to be null. I am mildly enthusiastic about lynching him, but I am also amenable to lynching Alduskkel, TWIE, or jilynne1991. I don't yet think mastin2 is scum based on his current posting; although he seems to me to be wildly off-target, he is clearly very passionate and that sort of investment appears townish. I also note that he took a stand in defending me early on D1 and I know that he was correct in his assessment of me.

But with neither TWIE nor TS being dead now connections between them will only be useful if one flips scum.<br>\n<br>\nWhat I get from 1017: I'm scum for pretty much not doing a whole lot. Maybe throw in the supposed wagoning of CC (who actually has never been seriously up for lynching).<br>\n<br>\nFair enough, I guess. Though, TS agrees with me on some points in there, so at the very least he must think I am contributing some. Whereas he barely mentions TWIE. Aside from the above quote, he says he'll \"trust Mastin on TWIE being town.\"<br>\n<br>\nYeah, if TWIE is scum then TS is too, and vice versa.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Twistedspoon wrote:</cite>immediately obvious is this<blockquote><div><cite>WormyKrew wrote:</cite><br>\nTown-<br>\nDarthYoshi<br>\nJilynne1991<br>\nAlduskkel<br>\nSecretproject</div></blockquote><br>\nAlduskkel as a town read, what's wrong with that? Well this reference is the only time in the krew ISo that he ever mentions Alduskkel. At all...</div></blockquote>You know who else is on that town list and isn't mentioned beforehand either? SecretProject and DarthYoshi. And while both of those people are mentioned later, WormyKrew does not have any hard interactions with them. There's questioning and such, but it's very light. And not too different from just ignoring them.<br>\n<br>\nI get that you don't bother noting that for SecretProject. But considering that you said DarthYoshi was suspect in 1017, I would have thought you would have said something about that too.<br>\n<br>\nAdditionally, WormyKrew also barely mentions TWIE either. One time he calls him a null read. Another time he indicates some suspicion. And the last time he makes a lackluster survivalist vote on him. I don't remember who said it before, but if there were 2 scum wagons Day 1, as I am beginning to suspect, then scum wouldn't care too much about which way the lynch was shifted. And that would correspond with both TWIE and WK not pushing each other too hard. In fact, TWIE never voted WK.<br>\n<br>\nThe most outrageous thing about 1020 is that it does not address even the existence of my wall. Seriously?

Nor SHOULD there be.</div></blockquote>Blatant railroading. How dare we consider other lynch options.<br>\n<br>\n1075, 1077, and 1080 are just awful posts in general.

Independently, he is rather scummy. In association with WK, he is in fact very scummy.<br>\n<br>\nCC's little \"I'm not seeing Aldscum\" ditty is noted for the same reason. If Ald does flip scum, I think CC deserves being under the microscope next.<br>\n<br>\nCompletely unrelated, these past series of posts seriously are making it difficult for me to conclude if Jily is really really suspicious or just a VI.</div></blockquote><br>\n-Null is not a scum tell.

Then I reread and came up with some of my own scumtells on him, and some of yours DarthYoshi.

WormyKrew was actually getting volatile with Ironhead (e.g. potholing \"Appeal to Contradiction\" to the Wikipedia article on \"Sense of Humor.\" It doesn't read as scum passively bussing for future town points. It reads as scum going for a mislynch.<br>\n<br>\nI don't think that scum would strongly bus Day 1, with the exception of near the end when it became clear that it was either TWIE or WK who was going to be lynched.<br>\n<br>\nAs for Ironhead's posts...<br>\n<br>\nHe starts off hitting the ground running in iso 0, with a decent vote for early page 2. That's town who immediately starts scumhunting.<br>\n<br>\nThen he gets into and argument with Secret Project which looks a lot like Town vs. Town. There's a fair amount of tunneling going on, with both players seemingly becoming more and more convinced the other is scum with each post the other makes. Ironhead also uses a sort of \"by the book\" scumhunting method (especially early on, naming Appeals and such), like someone who has a very good idea on how they're going to scumhunt, as opposed to someone who is just going to fake scumhunting.<br>\n<br>\nLater, Ironhead switches his vote from SP to WK. And later still, after switching to TWIE he switches back to WK again, setting them at L-2 and L-4, respectively. This is NOT what scum want to do to their partner. Assuming TWIE is town, Ironhead-scum would be content to just ride that mislynch.<br>\n<br>\nOn a more general note, Ironhead is an active scumhunter who spreads his attention enough to avoid tunneling (except with SP) while focusing in on his scum reads.

You hadn't really contributed much of note yesterday and <div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">what really makes me feeling strange is that you specifically mentioned next to nothing about the WK wagon for the entirety of d1</div>. What makes it particularly interesting is that you had no problem commenting on both the TWIE and Elsa wagons but strangely ignored the WK wagon for the most of the day. And what struck me as odd is that you clearly knew the wagon was going on. As quoted above you said you were thinking of putting Krew at L-1 for some pressure. Well a) that defeats the purpose of \"pressure\" votes and b) it appears it could very well be scum-motivated trying to show a willingness to lynch a scum partner for later in the game. If you really wanted to \"pressure\" him you would be asking WK questions and at least commenting on the wagon and suspicions on him that took up a lot of our time and ultimately led to his lynch day 1. It strikes me as strange that these two quotes were the most you ever said about WK yesterday really.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n@Mastin, I understand the idea of being paranoid of players who appear obv-town to lots of players. I don't mind the skepticism really. All I ask is that today and going forward you consider your suspicions and temper them with a bit of logic. Think about why you really suspect us...is it because you think we are scum or you are scared of the potential influence we have if we are scum? Which is the greater reason you are expressing doubt? If it is truly, and I mean truly, because you think we are scum, go ahead and present a solid case. I'm willing to listen and to explain our actions to you. I'm not saying you must have us in obv town status because I do think a bit of paranoia and questioning never hurt anyone, self-included. However, your comments like \"WK, Ald, Soben are the 3 confirmed scum\" makes it impossible for Regfan to listen to anything you say and it will annoy me at some point too if it continues. If you have a real case on us to present, please, be my guest.<br>\n<br>\nI would be very very surprised personally if the scum weren't in [CC, TWIE, Ald, Elsa] <br>\nNot really sure I like this Ald wagon tbh. We'd be willing to hammer pending a claim, but meh, personally I'd like to go for CC today. Reg thinks an Ald lynch is a good lynch but he'd probably be 3rd on my list to lynch today.

He thought she was scum, and didn't notice her claim.

His language is carefully tailored, which is fine. However, he is hiding behind it to avoid the arguments that he should be having. Secret pac man made a point that he was appealing to logic. Perhaps his wording was not strictly correct, however the context and meaning were plain. Ironhead refuses to give merit to anything that is not perfectly logically structured, which gives him a myriad of excuses to avoid nearly anything. It's like a corporation bogging you down in paper work so that a trial can't progress and you don't get your damages. Ironhead side tracked the argument so that he could yell at secret pac man for not having his Debate lingo spot on rather than actually have to answer to the presumed scum tell. </div></blockquote> There's also this.

This is a personal town-tell of mine. A signature scum move is to go completely against your (scummy) predecessor's views and take up an entirely new stance to (hopefully) become more favorable.<br>\n<br>\nA TOWN signature is to trust entirely in your predecessor and acknowledge their wisdom. This is especially important if the predecessor was extremely scummy. By embracing the reads of the scummy player, the person is essentially saying, \"my predecessor wasn't scummy by thinking this\". In other words, they're not trying to get a Fresh Start which many towns freely give to replacements.<br>\n<br>\nIt's a subconscious thing. But I've personally done this. As town, I very frequently look at the reads of my predecessor, and value them. I look into them and see why they thought that. While I'll use my own judgement on them to determine if they're right or not, I put significant weight on them.<br>\n<br>\nAnd as scum, I just carelessly toss them aside and go, \"screw that, I'm working for myself\", building a new image for me.<br>\n<br>\nI've observed it in others as well. I see pro-town players frequently employ the logic of their predecessors, and sum players just ignore their predecessor and ask the town to do the same. It might not be something we actively decide to do, but it happens.<br>\n<br>\nA lot. It's psychological. Not something you're aware of, but something which always happens whether you were thinking about it or not. And that's why it's nearly impossible to fake. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\nHe also used gut. His inability to effectively explain it reads as genuine. Trust me, as someone who has explanation problems, I can tell very well from situations like that if they're faking being unable to effectively explain it, or if they legitimately can't give a good answer.<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3105286#p3105286\" class=\"postlink\">There's also favorable interactions with WormyKrew</a>. And the fact that he was legitimately scumhunting on Secret. Look at Captain's early posts, and you'll realize he was pushing Secret as scum--something which could only have come from a pro-town player reading Secret as scum.<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3111889#p3111889\" class=\"postlink\">Captain shows paranoia</a>, thinking about the night-kill, fearing he gave the scum too much information.<br>\n<br>\nScum don't do that. They don't show paranoia towards giving out town-reads, because they're scum. They don't gain anything by trying to hide town-reads. They lose nothing by posting them. Town (theoretically) does.<br>\n<br>\nAdditionally, there's the fact that if you look at Captain's reads, he had Secret as solidly scum.<br>\n<br>\nWHY WOULD THE SCUM NK SOMEONE ONE OF THEIR MEMBERS HEAVILY WAS PUSHING AS SCUM?!??<br>\n<br>\n(\"...More experienced players talked them out of it?\"<br>\nWell, that's more evidence against <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Ald, <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Soben</div></div></div>, and maybe <div style=\"display:inline-flex;text-decoration:line-through\">Yoshi</div> as well, then. 'Cause guess what?<br>\nTWIE, Elsa, Jily, they're all inexperienced. And therefore could not be scum with Captain in this situation.)<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3112798#p3112798\" class=\"postlink\">This is an example of an assertive, \"SCREW YOU\" tone</a>. There's Scum \"SCREW YOU!\" (Soben displays this to me), and there's town \"SCEW YOU!\". This is definitely the latter.<br>\n<br>\nThe fact that Captain was stubbornly refusing to vote was also town--he was thinking for himself, trying to figure out what to do, rather than (as scum would do) placing a vote blindly at request.<br>\n<br>\nDo you think <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3125198#p3125198\" class=\"postlink\">scum would so heavily use Chainsaw Defense</a>, <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3116979#p3116979\" class=\"postlink\">after pointing out a percieved Chainsaw</a>?<br>\n<br>\nQuick answer, No.<br>\nCaptain also furthered his Secret suspicion, and was (in my opinion) legitimately convinced that WormyKrew was town, due to the interactions between the two Hydras.<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3144627#p3144627\" class=\"postlink\">Opinions like this</a>, a stubborn scumread on Elsa which refused to die, makes Captain even more town. <br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3161739#p3161739\" class=\"postlink\">There was no point in saying this as scum</a>.

It woulda been a scumtell had you said you preferred to play as scum.\" That part in both of them is fine. It is the same. The contradiction in here comes from what isn't there. \"Pretty RVS\". Does not translate to \"rather vote someone who might have committed a scumtell rather than Random\".<br>\n<br>\nSee the contradiction? I do. <br>\n<br>\n160 additionally contains some suspicious interactions with WormyKrew, in the form of Ald's \"Hardly\". <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Ald wrote:</cite>@Secret Project 104 (not quoting the whole thing): Don't you think it's more likely that Ironhead's posting style change is due to our shift from the goofy RVS/RQS stage to serious mafia business time?</div></blockquote>Call it parroting, call it fluff, call it active lurking, call it whatever. This was not new insight, but it was passed off as an attempt to look that way.

Like it contains valuable insight into the game?<br>\n<br>\nWell, sorry to inform you, there's nothing in there which hadn't been said before. From Jily Newbtown to Ironhead. It also contains a bit of hypocrisy, as guess what Ald quotes immediately after that? A post by Ironhead, which he responds to with <blockquote><div><cite>Ald wrote:</cite>This reads as OMGUS to me. Obviously when Secret Project asked if everyone was scum in the game, he was using hyperbole, regardless of his alignment. You're nitpicking grammar and basing a vote off of that and the fact that you think that he thinks you're scummy for being logical.

He didn't unvote then, however, and kept it on. <blockquote><div><cite>DarthYoshi wrote:</cite>@Alduskkel: You see Gerhard's derp vote on Jily as a scumtell and not a town tell, why?</div></blockquote> That says it better than I ever could.<br>\n<br>\nAnd now.

But what stinks even more is the town-list. Ald had posted pretty much nothing of content at that time--how the heck did WormyKrew get a town-read on Ald? Quite frankly, I do believe WormyKrew just stereotypically followed the \"one buddy scum, one buddy town\" tactic. This makes all of the Null names town, all of the Town names minus Ald as town, and one of the Scum names as actual scum (Split/Soben), with the others being town. It's almost certainly not Ironhead; those interactions do not look like bussing at ALL. It's VERY doubtfully Alex.<br>\nLeaving {Gerhard/Captain, Split/Soben} as containing one scum. You're mislynching Captain, but in doing so, you'll be condemning Soben to death, finally, along with Ald.<br>\n<br>\nYoshi/Ald containing one scum is pretty much a guarantee. This post where both Yoshi and Ald are mysteriously on the town-list for no apparent reason, kinda solidifies that as one reason among many. And WormyKrew's interactions with DarthYoshi do not give off the scum interacting with scum vibe. (Quite the opposite.)

(The exact same Tone, mind you, which I nailed WormyKrew for.) The post reeks of scum Motive. It also seems like it has inside knowledge--looking at this post, it looks like Ald already KNOWS that Jily used her shot, but got blocked. Jily had not posted that, yet.

I never, EVER support Policy Lynches, for a dang-good reason. Policy Lynching is lynching someone based off of their general playstyle. This is not the same thing as scumhunting. It's no better (and in fact is far worse) than random lynching. Ald's support for her death makes him far more likely scum.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I'd much prefer it if you actually did some scumhunting beyond gut and some weak scumtells thrown in on occasion.</div></blockquote>Blatant scum-coaching-town. Additionally, this does not read as someone who thinks Jily is scummy. This reads as someone who knows Jily is town, and wants to see more from her. Refer to the above, for why his support of her lynch therefore makes him scum.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div> I picked things that were especially wrong.

A pro-town player has only two tools for catching scum: their voice, and their vote. The latter is quite frankly more important to me than the former. (I believe that someone with a posting restriction of only being able to post votes can still do better scumhunting than pretty much everyone else in the thread. It's why that's my Dream-Post-Restriction--to have absolutely nothing but my Vote as a weapon against the scum. To prove this belief true.) I wrote two guides on why Pro-Town Players shouldn't waste their votes. (\"Mastin's Guide To Playing Well\" and \"Mastin's Guide to VCA\" both cover the subject of why there's pretty much no pro-town motivation to not vote.)<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3173959#p3173959\" class=\"postlink\">989</a> pretty much sums up my thoughts on Ald at the time--he posted pretty much nothing which'd have even possibly convinced me to move my vote.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Yoshi wrote:</cite>@Ald: If you're not going to vote and not going to give us a suspect list in lieu of a vote, then you are not looking a whole lot more townish than you were D1.</div></blockquote>Yoshi, you've finally got me thinking you're town.

Each player needs to be judged on whether their own playing style is sincere. There is no correct way to play and just as people in this game are different, their actions need to be judged differently.

I did cast suspicion on Ironhead, but there's nothing in my post that contradicts that.<br>\n<br>\nOh, and what was I supposed to do? Not say anything? jily was in the spotlight, and you'd probably accuse me of lurking or something if I had ignored her. Even if I have nothing new to say, it is for the best if I give my thoughts.

(Split/Scumhunter/Soben and Gerhard/Captain are both in the scum section.)<br>\n<br>\nIt's worthy noting that pretty much all of WormyKrew's suspects were extremely weak, and it REEKS of bussing in there. But what stinks even more is the town-list. Ald had posted pretty much nothing of content at that time--how the heck did WormyKrew get a town-read on Ald? Quite frankly, I do believe WormyKrew just stereotypically followed the \"one buddy scum, one buddy town\" tactic. This makes all of the Null names town, all of the Town names minus Ald as town, and one of the Scum names as actual scum (Split/Soben), with the others being town. It's almost certainly not Ironhead; those interactions do not look like bussing at ALL. It's VERY doubtfully Alex.<br>\nLeaving {Gerhard/Captain, Split/Soben} as containing one scum. You're mislynching Captain, but in doing so, you'll be condemning Soben to death, finally, along with Ald.<br>\n<br>\nYoshi/Ald containing one scum is pretty much a guarantee. This post where both Yoshi and Ald are mysteriously on the town-list for no apparent reason, kinda solidifies that as one reason among many. And WormyKrew's interactions with DarthYoshi do not give off the scum interacting with scum vibe. (Quite the opposite.) WormyKrew's interactions with Ald suggest...<br>\n...<br>\n. . .<br>\n<br>\n......WHAT interactions with Ald? (...Yeah.)</div></blockquote>So many assumptions! It could have been buddying. It could be that he liked what few posts I had then. You assume that he was following the 1 scum 1 town strategy. I've also pointed out that WK didn't interact with a lot of other people, including ones he put on his town list.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>mastin2 wrote:</cite>Ald's next post is <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3102254#p3102254\" class=\"postlink\">251</a>. <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Ald wrote:</cite>If you're not reading the thread before making a response, you obviously don't care about getting the full information available about your case and vote. Scum, as people not truly interested in catching scum, are more likely to do this.</div></blockquote>This is the polar opposite of the truth, and Ald of all people should know this. It's backwards--the people less interested in reading the thread aren't scum. They're town, who're bored. AKA, VTs. (Which fits perfectly with Captain's roleclaim--the slot was playing like a VT. As <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3104871#p3104871\" class=\"postlink\">Secret pointed out</a>, this applied to Captain just as much as Gerhard.) See also: Jily, a perfect example. She wasn't lying when she said she is more interested in the games where she's scum. And if you doubt that's enough, you can also look into me, and realize that this was close to MY belief as well. I put more attention into interesting games. And while if I was under heavy pressure (AKA, close to being lynched), a town-game would be interesting to me, quite frankly, the scum games held my interest a lot more frequently.<br>\n<br>\nIt's a frequent town-tell.</div></blockquote>Double standard ahoy. CC and jily are town for disinterest in the game -- but I'm not? Wouldn't it make sense if I was a VT too?<br>\n<br>\nOh, and I actually believe that scum don't read as close Mastin. I don't lie about theory! No matter my alignment. You could ask me post game and my answer would be the same. It doesn't really apply to the more experienced players (except for lurky ones), but for newer players who don't post a lot (like GK) it's applicable.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>mastin2 wrote:</cite><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>???

Exact wording. As town, he would have asked me to clarify. \"This isn't making sense--could you re-word it?\" or something like that. Instead, he simply flat-out says, \"it doesn't\". Essentially, flat-out saying, \"you're wrong\". Not in a town tone, at all. (Town Tone in this case would be saying \"Mastin, to be blunt, you're wrong\", or something like that. More to the point. Instead, Ald took the subtle approach to say the same thing, AKA, the scum way of discretely discrediting me.)</div></blockquote>I said it that way because that seems like the sort of dry humor, vaguely funny way of responding to what you said. It's amusing because of it's blunt response to something that doesn't usually get that kind of response (how often is \"if that makes sense\" replied to with \"no, it doesn't\"?).<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>mastin2 wrote:</cite>Secret's issue with Ald here is also quite valid.

I used to believe writing off an earlier post as a joke to be a scumtell a-la-EmpTyger--to some extent, I still do.) There was no town reason to give that sort of humor.

But quite frankly, measuring Motive and Tone for the votes would be a waste of time, because it wouldn't change the conclusion. I did the reasoning in my head for the voters' motives and tried to remember the tone of the votes off the top of my head, when I did the VCA.

The people on the wagon, were right, and you called it \"devoid of reasoning\". Despite it having been right.<br>\nYou're scum. I'm right. The people on the wagon, are right.

If you had just said, \"jily would have been blocked regardless of her target's alignment\", that'd have been null. I said as much. The thought process you used to explain it REEKS of inside knowledge, reeks of being the mind-set of a scum player who thought it through last night and is almost copy-pasting from the Mafia QT. It wasn't the insight which was the problem. It was the thought process used to post said insight. Mindset is one of the strongest sub-sets of Motive.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I meant look at in terms of \"I need to iso these people.\"</div></blockquote>This does not answer the issue.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I wouldn't know if jily had used her shot or not unless I was a tracker, watcher, or jily.</div></blockquote>Or, you're the freakin' scum RoleBlocker and KNOW Jily was blocked.<br>\n<br>\nAdditionally, the wording of this: <blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I wouldn't know if jily had used her shot or not unless I was a tracker, watcher, or jily.<br>\n<br>\nI think that it is no big assumption to think that jily had used her shot. And if it hadn't gone through, then it's also no big assumption to think that a roleblocker is afoot.</div></blockquote> ...Implies that Ald thinks (or KNOWS) that Jily is town and therefore not lying, whereas...<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Also, jily is scummy. If she isn't then address what I've said against her.</div></blockquote> THIS reaffirms that Ald thinks Jily is scum. (No, wait, worse. Ald thinks Jily is scum<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">my</div>. That's ten times worse, because it leaves him the chance to back out at any time by saying, \"scummy, but not scum\".)<br>\n<br>\nSpeaking of which.

Maybe you should try reading my posts with the idea that I'm town and see what comes up.</div></blockquote>I did. I came up with...well, nothing. I saw nothing positive in a town-Ald. I saw nothing which looked like I could praise you for. I had to fight, hard, to make a universe where Ald was town exist. And it collapsed the second I stopped trying.<br>\n<br>\nYou're scum. You're overdefensive, opportunistic, lurky, walling, anti-town scum. (I meant it when I said, I really see the old scum-Mastin when I look into Ald.)<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>My defense is rather condemning?</div></blockquote>Yes. You dig your hole deeper every time you post. Even if Captain is mislynched today, you're not going to escape forever, Ald. You might've manipulated a few people into thinking you're not scum, but when Captain flips town, their viewpoint will collapse. They will realize, \"...Maybe Mastin wasn't so Mad afterall.\" They'll look at you, and look at me, and realize, I was right and they will be ashamed that they were fooled by your hollow see-through defense.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>You know, Occam's Razor applies when one possibility requires less assumptions/the assumptions are fairly like to be true.</div></blockquote>It's not less assumptions. It's simpler assumptions. Compare mine to yours.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Lots of normals?</div></blockquote>Exclusively normals. And limited-shot vigs are incredibly common. While we didn't know it to be the case, you can look at Desert Mafia for an example--the Delayed Action Vig was two-shot. One instance of many. You can also look at Oldy Mafia, which had a limited-shot vig. The role is on the uprising, and is incredibly common.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>If so, what makes you think that you haven't just encountered a large number of 1-shot vigs or something?</div></blockquote>Occam's Razor. Which is more likely?<br>\nThat I've seen an abnormally large number of 1-shot vigs, that I've seen lots of people favoring their usage all across the site and that it never actually gets put into practice?<br>\n...Or that they actually are on the rise and becoming incredibly common?<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Well, of course he will if I flip scum.

{"number": 1465, "id": "3281478", "user": "DarthYoshi", "user_id": "14971", "content": "Okay--the numbers of the VC's are in reference to the ISO # (of Substrike) in which the VC occurs.  This VC is focused mostly on Ald and WK, and they yield some significant townreads.  This is a bit of a wall, but hopefully an informative one.<br>\n<br>\n#5: WK is voting Ironhead, Alduskkel is voting me.  In both cases are scum voting players that everyone else should have on strong townreads by this point (in my case, I would cite Mastin's argument on his own behalf--unless you think I was executing a double-bus on D1, I'm town.)<br>\n<br>\n#7: WK is voting Jily (this be about the time jily was screaming 'easy lynch,' and we now know she is who she said she was.  (PS: Jily, welcome to my modding blacklist.)  Ald isn't voting.<br>\n<br>\n#9: Ald's vote goes back to me, WK's goes back to Ironhead.  Since the two known scum have shown a reluctance to bus early, this should almost completely clear Ironhead as well as myself.  Additionally, and this is important--Spitfarvle (who will be replaced by Soben) is the only vote listed on WK.  Given that the other two scum aren't bussing, I have to think that Spit was town, unless he simply didn't get the no-bussing memo.  <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Mastin, this means that Soben is probtown.  You should remove your vote.</div><br>\n<br>\n#12: Ald's vote goes to CC--given what I note just above, this is actually a strong point in favor of CC being town, because Ald hadn't bussed yet, and it would make no sense for him to try to gin up a wagon on one scumbuddy in order to try to divert attention from the current wagon on the other buddy.  CC is almost certainly town, Mastin was correct on that one.<br>\n<br>\n#17: WK is at L-2, and Ald still hasn't bussed, which to me says his vote on WK was more a last resort, and in any case, the WK wagon at this point has two confirmed town (jily and SP) and three obvtown (me, Ironhead, Mastin).  WK moves vote to SP, a player we now know is town, so bussing still isn't something scum seem willing to do for towncred.<br>\n<br>\n#26: Brokenscraps (to become TS) hops on the WK wagon.  This *could* be a bus if broken replaced in, saw a buddy in danger, and felt the need to reap immediate towncred.  But I think TS's entry into the game is townish, so on balance, that slot is fairly nullish now.<br>\n<br>\n#27: Here's why Broken's vote looks like a bus--he immediately jumps off to join the TWIE wagon--makes sense for a scum if they see a possibility for an alternate wagon.  This hypothesis would mean Xvart in TWIE's spot is town, and TS is scum.<br>\n<br>\n#29: At this point, Ald goes for the bus, and I do think he is the only scum on the final WK wagon.  As for the TWIE wagon, it is worth noting that WK does not change his vote to the rival wagon in an effort of self-preservation, which is a scumpoint to Xvart.  If the TWIE wagon is in fact scumdriven, it was probably by broken/TS or alex, but alex looks more town on D2 than he did on D1.<br>\n<br>\nAt the time of the final D1 VC, the possible scum candidates to me are (excluding Ald): Elsa, Broken, Alex, and Xvart.  On to D2...<br>\n<br>\nD2, #50: Ald waits for a long time to vote, but eventually decides on Alex.  Given Ald's reluctance to bus on D1, this is a townpoint for Alex.<br>\n<br>\n#55: Ald moves from Alex to CC--smacks of self-preservation, but as I noted earlier, CC is probtown now.<br>\n<br>\nThe D1 lynch wagon consisted of: Mastin2, jilynne1991, Alduskkel, Ironhead, Darth Yoshi, Secret Project, Soben.  Two confirmed town and one confirmed scum.  I believe the rest of the players on this wagon were town, and that the third scum was off the WK wagon.<br>\n<br>\nThe D2 lynch wagon consisted of: Mastin2, Twistedspoon, Wiredalexv, Darth Yoshi, Xvart, CC.  No confirmed town or scum, BUT it gives us a player who was on neither lynching wagon: Elsa.  Her scumminess is compounded by the reality that despite her back and forth with GK and Alex, neither Ald nor WK ever really suspected her.  I'm pretty sure she's the final scum.

I don't try to convince them they're wrong, because I know that if I were in their position, I'd only be convinced of my read. Instead, I just continue on with scumhunting, shrugging off their attacks.<br>\n<br>\n(There are obvious exceptions to this. If it's close to lylo, for instance, I can't afford to have them thinking I'm scum. Additionally, if they share one or multiple scumreads with me, yet think I'm scum, I'll try to convince them to \"save me for later\" and to lynch our mutual suspects.)", "time": "Tue Jul 26, 2011 10:25 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=17645&start=1500", "forum": "53", "thread": "17645"}

I was pretty aware of the risks but I felt like there were enough people who thought me null to town that IF there was a cop the odds would be in my favor of not getting checked last night. Plus, I felt like my best bet would be to play the cards I was dealt and work with you all. Mastin/Soben would create a nice smokescreen, there were enough people that might take a mislynch based on the flips, etc. I really felt like of all the options and NK choices that the cop check would be the least of my problems going into the day. lol. Plus, not knowing who the investigative role would be I didn't want to risk killing someone protown that would help my agenda without a definite investigation kill.", "time": "Wed Jul 27, 2011 6:24 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=17645&start=1500", "forum": "53", "thread": "17645"}
