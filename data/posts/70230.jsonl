The <a href=\"http://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Forum_Rules_and_Guidelines\" class=\"postlink\">site-wide rules</a> and <a href=\"http://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Boilerplate_Mafiascum_Game_Rules\" class=\"postlink\">Boilerplate Mafiascum Game Rules</a> are in play. Please know them.<br>2. Be nice. I will be the arbiter of what 'nice' is. I am pretty tolerant about this but there is a line.<br>3. Do not discuss the game outside the game thread, except with the moderator, unless your Role PM specifies that you may do so. Do not discuss other ongoing games in this thread or in any topics you might have access to.<br>4. You may ask me questions either in the thread or via PM. For some questions, I may be willing to answer via PM but not in-thread for a variety of reasons. <br>5. Do not quote private communication with me directly. Paraphrasing is acceptable; if you're not sure whether a post violates this rule, ask me or don't post it. You also may not pretend to quote communications with me. This includes your Role PM.<br>6. My color is <span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: darkorange\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">DARK ORANGE</span></span></span>; please don't use it.<br>7. No dice tags or otherwise provably arbitrary algorithms.<br>8. Do not attempt to emulate out-of-thread communication using encryption or hidden/obscured text.<br>9. Don't do things you know you shouldn't do, even if I've neglected to include a rule on the matter. Likewise, attempts to circumvent these rules via semantics will be treated harshly.<br>10. I reserve the right to warn, force-replace, or modkill as I deem necessary. Don't push it.<br>11. I reserve the right to add to or change the rules.<br><br><span style=\"font-size: 200%; line-height: 116%;\">Procedural Rules</span><br><br>1. If you wish to vote for a player, please use vote tags or bold tags. That said, if you forget the tags, your vote will still count if it is clear to me that a vote was intended.<br>2. A player is considered lynched when he or she reaches a number of votes equal to half the number of living players rounded down plus one.<br>3. You may continue discussion in twilight before I show up and lock the thread. Do not post after I officially state that you are dead.<br>4. If no majority is reached by deadline there will be No Lynch.<br>5. Days will have a non-negotiable deadline of 2 weeks. I may choose to extend a deadline in special circumstances, but it's unlikely. Don't count on it.<br>6. Nights last 48 hours.<br>7. Prods go out after 48 hours. Failure to post in a timely fashion after a prod, or accumulating several prods, may result in force replacement at my discretion.<br>8. A single mafia member can both kill and take another action.<br>9. All Private Topics, including any Mafia factions, have daytalk enabled.<br><br>What follows is a sample Vanilla Townie role PM:<br><br><div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: \"VT Role PM\"</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display: none;\">Welcome to Pine's Death Trap!

The only illumination comes from a pair of bare incandescent bulbs hanging from wires on the ceiling. By its dim light, a series of framed portraits, incongruous for their elegance, may be discerned. They depicts a different instrument of torture and interrogation, each more unsettling than the last. A caption beneath each image tells the story of that devious device, delighting in the perverse.

I noted people getting all excited to apply newb tells to him, while failing to note that a newb tell is alignment neutral. They would even say things like 'he's either newb town, or newb scum due to X' while Rauth was actively claiming to be newb - which is a bit like saying I have a sheep for an avatar. Sure, it's true - but it's of no benefit to figuring out my alignment, so why bother bringing it up?

It's not a smoking gun, but if he's scum you've done actions that I can easily describe as defensive and deflective for the slot while also doing some sort of vague either-or setup for no discernible reason. It reads to me as a soft setup to allow you to push a false argument (one of them is scum, options open) but when questioned on it you kind of did an awkward defense of both. I think it reads as softly scummy in general, and if Gerry is scum I could see it as defense.

The fingernail stayed jammed in the light fixture - his finger did not. He considers the incident the single most painful experience of his life, though he of course took it like a man and refused the supervisor's offer of the rest of the day off.

The animals were trained and versatile, able to kill victims immediately or to torture them slowly over a prolonged period. Most commonly employed by royalty, the elephants were used to signify both the ruler's absolute power and his ability to control wild animals.<br><br>The sight of elephants executing captives both horrified and attracted the interest of European travelers, and was recorded in numerous contemporary journals and accounts of life in Asia. The practice was eventually suppressed by the European empires that colonised the region in the 18th and 19th centuries. While primarily confined to Asia, the practice was occasionally adopted by Western powers, such as Ancient Rome and Carthage, particularly to deal with mutinous soldiers.</span></span></span></span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-6]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">Grendel - </span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-5]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">Akarin - Vifam </span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-4]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">Rautherdir - RadiantCowbells, Transcend </span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-6]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">JarJarDrinks - </span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-6]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">Lil Uzi Vert - </span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-3]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">Transcend - Cooperative Sheep, Rautherdir, JarJarDrinks  </span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-6]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">Cooperative Sheep - </span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-6]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">Keyser S\u00f6ze - </span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-5]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">Vifam - Akarin  </span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-4]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">mattblackguy - Keyser S\u00f6ze, Lil Uzi Vert </span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-5]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">RadiantCowbells - mattblackguy </span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"font-size: 125%; line-height: 116%;\">Waiting for their DOOM</span></span> - Grendel <br><br><div style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"font-size: 100%; line-height: 116%;\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Day 2 ends in <span class=\"countdown\"><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">(expired on 2017-02-17 18:00:00)</span></span></span></span></div></fieldset>"}

The process involved tying the condemned prisoner to a wooden frame, usually in a public place. The flesh was then cut from the body in multiple slices in a process that was not specified in detail in Chinese law, and therefore most likely varied. The punishment worked on three levels: as a form of public humiliation, as a slow and lingering death, and as a punishment after death.

This elaborate technique combined several other means of killing a man into one complex ritual, as the victim was first bound to a wooden framework and either marched or dragged to the site, then hanged by the neck nearly to the point of death. The barely-conscious criminal was then cut down, castrated, and disemboweled. Their innards and genitals were then burned in front of them. Then the victims limbs were bound to four horses and stretched to the point of breaking and tearing, and finally the executioner killed them with a blow to the body with an axe or sword.

No one is forcing you to play defense. Town actually tends to perform really well under pressure because they have less and less to lose as they get nearer to being lynched unless they have a juicy role PM. If you want to prove to me that you are Town I want you to find and catch the scumteam. I don't want just one scum, I want the whole fucking team, and we will powerlynch them together if you do. Otherwise, I will continue to consider you an enormous scumlord and I will consider it my honored duty to powerlynch the fuck out of you and leave you dead and burning in the wreckage of your own ego.

The sailor was tied to a line that looped beneath the vessel, thrown overboard on one side of the ship, and dragged under the ship's keel, either from one side of the ship to the other, or the length of the ship (from bow to stern). As the hull was usually covered in barnacles and other marine growth, if the offender was pulled quickly, keelhauling would typically result in serious cuts, loss of limbs and even decapitation. If the offending sailor was merely to be punished, they would be keelhauled along the beam (the widest part of the ship), though this could still maim or kill. Keelhauling along the entire length of the ship usually resulted in death, whether from drowning, blunt force trauma, or simply being shredded apart by barnacles.</span></span></span></span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-6]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">Grendel - </span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-6]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">Akarin - </span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-6]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">Rautherdir - </span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-4]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">JarJarDrinks - Akarin, RadiantCowbells </span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-5]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">Lil Uzi Vert - mattblackguy </span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-5]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">nancy - Cooperative Sheep      </span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-6]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">Cooperative Sheep - </span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-6]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">Keyser S\u00f6ze - </span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-6]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">Vifam - </span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-5]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">mattblackguy - Keyser S\u00f6ze  </span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-5]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">RadiantCowbells - nancy </span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"font-size: 125%; line-height: 116%;\">Waiting for their DOOM</span></span> - Rautherdir, Vifam, JarJarDrinks, Grendel, Lil Uzi Vert<br><br><div style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"font-size: 100%; line-height: 116%;\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Day 2 ends in <span class=\"countdown\"><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">(expired on 2017-02-17 18:00:00)</span></span></span></span></div></fieldset>"}

From a scumhunting perspective, scum are more cooperative when they think you like them and town are more cooperative when they think you dislike them. The way I saw it when I replaced in, the game was on a somewhat precarious balance where Town was divided in opinion over the RC slot and the Vifam slot. I was 90% sure RC was Town and pushed the fuck out of it to eliminate the remaining 10% and stop Town from derailing itself on Transcend. RC was almost policy if that Transcend lynch went through. I basically fucked up the creeping opposition to townbloc and clarified the positions of a few slots that were previously murky, so I'm not about to apologize for the WIFOM.<br><br>@LUV I'm not pushing for a Grendel lynch right now. I'm not hiding my read on him because he's widely TRed and I don't want that to be a blindspot should I die, but there's no action there at this time.<br><br>@RC I don't think we should lynch LUV today. I'm not sold on this being scum. Let me pocket him and we can reconsider once we have a flip or two. This slot isn't a threat right now.<br><br>@Grendel why do you have Vifam as a TR?<br><br>@Town there's no reason to hammer a lynch with this much time left in the Day. Even if we agree on a lynch we can just leave it at L-2 until we get closer to deadline and capitalize on that time by scumhunting. Sheep, Vifam, and matt are probably the most contested slots right now, so we should focus our attentions there."}

Usually, all members of the group are instructed to fire simultaneously, thus preventing both disruption of the process by a single member and identification of the member who fired the lethal shot. To avoid the disfigurement of multiple shots to the head, the shooters are typically instructed to aim at the heart, sometimes aided by a paper target. The prisoner is typically blindfolded or hooded, as well as restrained, although in some cases prisoners have asked to be allowed to face the firing squad without their eyes covered. Executions can be carried out with the condemned either standing or sitting. There is a tradition in some jurisdictions that such executions are carried out at first light, or at sunrise, which is usually up to half an hour later. This gave rise to the phrase \"shot at dawn.\"<br><br>Execution by firing squad is distinct from other forms of execution by firearms, such as an execution by a single firearm to the back of the head or neck. However, the single shot by the squad's officer with a pistol (coup de gr\u00e2ce) is sometimes incorporated in a firing squad execution, particularly if the initial volley turns out not to be immediately fatal.</span></span></span></span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-6]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">Grendel - </span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-6]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">Akarin - </span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-6]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">Rautherdir - </span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"font-size: 125%; line-height: 116%;\">[L-1]</span></span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">JarJarDrinks - Akarin, nancy, Grendel, Lil Uzi Vert, Fro99er</span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-3]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">Lil Uzi Vert - mattblackguy, Keyser S\u00f6ze, RadiantCowbells </span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-4]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">nancy - Cooperative Sheep, JarJarDrinks     </span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-6]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">Cooperative Sheep - </span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-6]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">Keyser S\u00f6ze - </span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-6]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">Fro99er - </span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-6]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">mattblackguy -   </span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-6]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">RadiantCowbells - </span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"font-size: 125%; line-height: 116%;\">Waiting for their DOOM</span></span> - Rautherdir<br><br><div style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"font-size: 100%; line-height: 116%;\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Day 2 ends in <span class=\"countdown\"><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">(expired on 2017-02-17 18:00:00)</span></span></span></span></div></fieldset>"}

Usually, all members of the group are instructed to fire simultaneously, thus preventing both disruption of the process by a single member and identification of the member who fired the lethal shot. To avoid the disfigurement of multiple shots to the head, the shooters are typically instructed to aim at the heart, sometimes aided by a paper target. The prisoner is typically blindfolded or hooded, as well as restrained, although in some cases prisoners have asked to be allowed to face the firing squad without their eyes covered. Executions can be carried out with the condemned either standing or sitting. There is a tradition in some jurisdictions that such executions are carried out at first light, or at sunrise, which is usually up to half an hour later. This gave rise to the phrase \"shot at dawn.\"<br><br>Execution by firing squad is distinct from other forms of execution by firearms, such as an execution by a single firearm to the back of the head or neck. However, the single shot by the squad's officer with a pistol (coup de gr\u00e2ce) is sometimes incorporated in a firing squad execution, particularly if the initial volley turns out not to be immediately fatal.</span></span></span></span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-6]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">Grendel - </span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-6]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">Akarin - </span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-6]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">Rautherdir - </span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"font-size: 125%; line-height: 116%;\">[L-1]</span></span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">JarJarDrinks - Akarin, nancy, Grendel, Lil Uzi Vert, Fro99er</span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-3]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">Lil Uzi Vert - mattblackguy, Keyser S\u00f6ze, RadiantCowbells </span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-4]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">nancy - Cooperative Sheep, JarJarDrinks     </span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-6]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">Cooperative Sheep - </span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-6]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">Keyser S\u00f6ze - </span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-6]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">Fro99er - </span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-6]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">mattblackguy -   </span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-6]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">RadiantCowbells - </span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"font-size: 125%; line-height: 116%;\">Waiting for their DOOM</span></span> - Rautherdir<br><br><div style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"font-size: 100%; line-height: 116%;\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Day 2 ends in <span class=\"countdown\"><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">(expired on 2017-02-17 18:00:00)</span></span></span></span></div></fieldset></div></blockquote>"}

I found a lot of his play early on forced and felt like he was fence sitting. He's also recently been calling for my head but I don't think he's made any attempt to sort me or even has said why he's scum reading me.  <br><br>I am scum reading Sheep mainly because of his push on the Transcend slot and PoE. <br><br>I didn't get why he was so focused on Transcend during D2 and it sort of pinged me because nothing really stood out to me from Transcend's play. When I looked back at their interactions on D1, all I saw was him explaining to Transcend in a sort of condescending tone about why there was a wagon on Grendel and him confirming who he is to Transcend. The latter came off  more snobbish and patronizing then the former. It read like he was projecting a level of importance that he felt he rightfully earned at that point of the game which was very odd. This lead me to believe throughout my reread that there will be various play style and personality clashes between the two and that a lot of what they'll be scum reading each other for will be overblown.<br><br>At the start of D2, he voted Transcend and then I believe states he voted for him because of effort and his suspect voting pattern on D1. Effort is NAI. The second point however is a valid point but if you take a look back on D1, I believe Transcend voted for at least 4-5 different people before voting for Gerry according to my notes. What Sheep fails to acknowledge is that lot of those votes where in RVS and that scum would prefer not to bring that much attention themselves by voting like it's going out of style. <br><br>Sheep later on questions Transcend about his take on the Gerry and Grendel's wagons but does it in such a way that comes off like he's trying to show others that Transcend is stating his theories as fact. Now I have no idea why Transcend really didn't answer these questions from Sheep but his attitude seemed carefree and just genuine. I think scum would be more alert, more on guard, and try to look as pro-town as possible. Transcend did the exact opposite and while it could've been just an act, I find the simplest explanation always the most probable. <br><br>Here we are now and he's pushing nancy over her claiming immediately on replacement and only looking at the vote counts. Which is weird but doesn't make her scum. The latter however is a very bad angle to push in my opinion. Various players on this site put a lot of stock into VCA and nancy may just be one of them. Wouldn't surprise me to be honest since I've heard a lot of good things about her play. He's essentially scum reading her for play style rather than looking for the motivation of her actions.<br><br>--<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">@Mod: I'll be v/LA till the 16th.

A dark thread of conspiracy and suspicion mars the brief harmony that had begun to form between strangers caught in a life-and-death situation. This ugliness rapidly turns nasty, and the anger focuses on one of you which had, until now, been fairly well-regarded. JarJarDrinks is at first disdainful of the accusations, but they quickly grow in momentum as the group turns on him. JarJarDrinks is relentlessly shoved forward. He quails away from the silken pullcord, regarding it as if it were a fanged serpent. Eventually he is shoved down next to it, falling to his knees, and a hand reaches out to yank the cord. As JarJarDrinks screams and tries to scramble away, the rest of you bolt. A deep gong sound echoes through the room, and a hatch in the ceiling opens, dropping a giant stone onto JarJarDrinks, smashing him into pulp against the floor, shattering a giant hole down to the next level.</span><br><br><span style=\"font-size: 125%; line-height: 116%;\">JarJarDrinks has died, crushed beneath an enormous stone!

Gilles de Rais served as a commander in the French Royal Army, and fought against the English and their Burgundian allies during the Hundred Years' War, for which he was appointed Marshal of France. After retiring from the military de Rais was accused of engaging in a series of child murders, with victims possibly numbering in the hundreds. The killings came to an end in 1440, when a violent dispute with a clergyman led to an ecclesiastical investigation which brought the crimes to light, and attributed them to Gilles.

Says I'm scum because I didn't want to policy lynch transcend and announced he was at L-1. Then misrepresented my reason for not hammering Transcend (he said it was only because my scumreads were on the wagon, but ignorned the fact that I didn't want to policy lynch). Says I'm confirmed scum because he doesn't like my reads post.<br>3. After his back and forth with Jar he backed off of Jar, and started pushing me even though there was nothing that Jar said that warranted him to back off of him.

They basically have to be opposite teams, so if Matt flips town it's almost guaranteed Keyser is scum.<br><br>But we can come to that game state later.

If we let Akarin be town for post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8866260#p8866260\">1806</a>, then it comes down to Nancy and Sheep. Thankfully they cross vote each other in Vote Count 2.1 (when Nancy is still Transcend). It's more likely Nancy is town, because they voted JarJar and Sheep, plus also voting Matt between Vote Count 1.1 and 1.2, meaning they'd have voted for all three scum, although the Nancy/Transcend combo also voted four town in myself/Vifam, Rauth, RC, and Gerry. But that looks more like lost town. Sheep vote parked both days...D1 on Grendel (town) and D2 on Transcend/Nancy. Scum tend to have static reads, and the fact that Sheep didn't really case Grendel or Transcend (ok, he cased Transcend but it was REALLY weak) makes him more likely scum than Transcend/Nancy.<br><br>So tl;dr when I die it goes like this (in order):<br><br>lynch MBG...<br><ul><li>if MBG scum then Sheep -&gt; Nancy -&gt; Akarin is the order for the partner to JJD/MBG. Uzi, Grendel, Keyser are town in this scenario.</li><li>if MBG town then Keyser -&gt; ??? -&gt; ??? ... but Uzi is still town in this scenario. I honestly can't narrow down who Keyser's partner would be in this scenario because he's parked on MBG and Uzi D2, and MBG and Grendel D1, and nobody has voted him in any of these Vote Counts.</li><li>In a really weird scenario where both MBG and Keyser are town, then 2.7 means Nancy was the counterwagon to scum JarJar, so Sheep is confscum here with either Akarin or Grendel.</li><li>Finally, there's some fucked up gamestate where RC and Rauth are both scum with JJD, but I really don't want to think about that. But RC does have that cunning manipulator banner...</li></ul><br>Now I am fine with lynching me if you all need to."}

I found a lot of his play early on forced and felt like he was fence sitting. He's also recently been calling for my head but I don't think he's made any attempt to sort me or even has said why he's scum reading me.  <br><br>I am scum reading Sheep mainly because of his push on the Transcend slot and PoE. <br><br>I didn't get why he was so focused on Transcend during D2 and it sort of pinged me because nothing really stood out to me from Transcend's play. When I looked back at their interactions on D1, all I saw was him explaining to Transcend in a sort of condescending tone about why there was a wagon on Grendel and him confirming who he is to Transcend. The latter came off  more snobbish and patronizing then the former. It read like he was projecting a level of importance that he felt he rightfully earned at that point of the game which was very odd. This lead me to believe throughout my reread that there will be various play style and personality clashes between the two and that a lot of what they'll be scum reading each other for will be overblown.<br><br>At the start of D2, he voted Transcend and then I believe states he voted for him because of effort and his suspect voting pattern on D1. Effort is NAI. The second point however is a valid point but if you take a look back on D1, I believe Transcend voted for at least 4-5 different people before voting for Gerry according to my notes. What Sheep fails to acknowledge is that lot of those votes where in RVS and that scum would prefer not to bring that much attention themselves by voting like it's going out of style. <br><br>Sheep later on questions Transcend about his take on the Gerry and Grendel's wagons but does it in such a way that comes off like he's trying to show others that Transcend is stating his theories as fact. Now I have no idea why Transcend really didn't answer these questions from Sheep but his attitude seemed carefree and just genuine. I think scum would be more alert, more on guard, and try to look as pro-town as possible. Transcend did the exact opposite and while it could've been just an act, I find the simplest explanation always the most probable. <br><br>Here we are now and he's pushing nancy over her claiming immediately on replacement and only looking at the vote counts. Which is weird but doesn't make her scum. The latter however is a very bad angle to push in my opinion. Various players on this site put a lot of stock into VCA and nancy may just be one of them. Wouldn't surprise me to be honest since I've heard a lot of good things about her play. He's essentially scum reading her for play style rather than looking for the motivation of her actions.<br><br>--<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">@Mod: I'll be v/LA till the 16th.

He scumread on ne was super weak and nongenuine but tried to push it off as truth. Seriously look at his reasons for scumreading me yesterday. Said I was scum for scumreading Jar for a weak reason, and then townreading him day 2, but Vifam(his slot) did the same exact thing. Says I'm scum because I didn't want to policy lynch transcend and announced he was at L-1. Then misrepresented my reason for not hammering Transcend (he said it was only because my scumreads were on the wagon, but ignorned the fact that I didn't want to policy lynch). Says I'm confirmed scum because he doesn't like my reads post.<br>3. After his back and forth with Jar he backed off of Jar, and started pushing me even though there was nothing that Jar said that warranted him to back off of him. He then pushed me, and tried to get others to push me because he knew it would be better to get a mislynch on me first before lynching Jar day 3.</div></div></div><br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Frog</span><br><br>Good shit RC.

He scumread on ne was super weak and nongenuine but tried to push it off as truth. Seriously look at his reasons for scumreading me yesterday. Said I was scum for scumreading Jar for a weak reason, and then townreading him day 2, but Vifam(his slot) did the same exact thing. Says I'm scum because I didn't want to policy lynch transcend and announced he was at L-1. Then misrepresented my reason for not hammering Transcend (he said it was only because my scumreads were on the wagon, but ignorned the fact that I didn't want to policy lynch). Says I'm confirmed scum because he doesn't like my reads post.<br>3. After his back and forth with Jar he backed off of Jar, and started pushing me even though there was nothing that Jar said that warranted him to back off of him. He then pushed me, and tried to get others to push me because he knew it would be better to get a mislynch on me first before lynching Jar day 3.</div></div></div><br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Frog</span><br><br>Good shit RC.

Vlad began a purge among the Wallachian boyars to strengthen his position, and came into conflict with the Transylvanian Saxons.

Vlad III also had several conflicts with the Ottomans, massacring tens of thousands of their subjects.

There's no way he just latches into fake claims and wuickhammers as town. He thinks far better than that as town. You were in AngryPig's game with us. Yes it's a bit burdened by proficiency that I'm doing to him, but it's less so that and more so his read on you was really one-dimensional and was all about your claim. Which he should realize is something you can do as both alignments, yet he never gave the town option consideration. Plus there were some associatives with MBG and sheep which is obviously not that credible of a reason to you. But to me it counted a bit.<br><br>Uzi is harder to explain. Can you not see how his push in Sheep is actually really good? I think so anyway. I get what youbsee between him and Jar, but I think it's more than offset by other town things like that push. I get it from your point of view. I'm just quite convinced and I honestly cannot explain it any further. And if Matt is scum (which I think he is) Uzi is 100% clear"}

I understand that you're paranoid but it looks like it's starting to eat you alive and I'm not too fond of you potentially self destructing after we just caught scum.

He came to power by uniting many of the nomadic tribes of Northeast Asia. After founding the Empire and being proclaimed \"Genghis Khan\", he started the Mongol invasions that conquered most of Eurasia. In just a few short decades, Genghis Khan would conquer most of what is now Central Asia, China, Korea, the Middle East, Russia (minus Siberia and Kamchatka), and Eastern Europe. He and sons and grandsons conquered more territory than any other empire in history, dwarfing both the Romans, Macedonians, as well as the colonial powers of later centuries. Their dominion was built on the blood and corpses of their enemies, as they would execute the populations of entire cities who refused to surrender. Mongol warriors were frequently given a quota of executions they had to perform before being allowed to rape and pillage.

Obviously you have to mix up your meta every now and then to keep Town healthily paranoid but there's a bus in every single game I'm in it seems like and it's just ridiculous."}

Mao\u2019s rule, with its economic mismanagement and continual political upheavals, also spelled poverty for the bulk of China\u2019s enormous population. His policies were also designed to massively inflate the Chinese population, as he felt that nuclear war was inevitable, and hoped that mere thousands of surviving Europeans, Russians, and Americans could be overwhelmed by millions of Chinese survivors of nuclear holocaust. This inflation of the Chinese population helped drive further scarcity and reliance on agrarian economic systems. Between 45 and 60 million Chinese were killed under Mao's tenure, perhaps more than the purges of Hitler and Stalin combined, rivaled only by the most horrific estimates of the Mongol conquests under Temujin.</span></span></span></span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-6]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">Grendel - </span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-6]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">Akarin - </span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-6]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">Rautherdir - </span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-6]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">Lil Uzi Vert - </span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-5]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">nancy - RadiantCowbells </span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-4]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">Cooperative Sheep - Grendel, mattblackguy </span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-6]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">Keyser S\u00f6ze - </span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-5]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">Fro99er - Fro99er  </span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-4]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">mattblackguy - Lil Uzi Vert, Keyser S\u00f6ze </span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-6]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">RadiantCowbells - </span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-5]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">No Lynch - Rautherdir</span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"font-size: 125%; line-height: 116%;\">Waiting for their DOOM</span></span> - Akarin, Cooperative Sheep, nancy <br><br><br><div style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"font-size: 100%; line-height: 116%;\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Day 3 ends in <span class=\"countdown\"><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">(expired on 2017-03-01 19:45:00)</span></span></span></span></div></fieldset>"}

The drive for ambition merely concentrates those prone to bad behavior in one place, as ambition is a primary motivation for bad actors. Remember that there were members of all Houses who went over to Voldemort, and it wasn't even Gryffindor that had the fewest; it was Hufflepuff, as their defining attributes include loyalty and service to the community.

If MBG is scum, then my post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8866237#p8866237\">1805</a> shows Grendel is 100% town and my post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8867697#p8867697\">1815</a> shows Keyser is 100% town (which fits with the assumption).<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">The alternative is that Keyser is scum if Matt flips town</span>, and that would make sense given how they voted together D1 (and keyser voted matt), and then voted against each other D2, but ultimately ended up on the same wagon in Vote Count 2.7. They basically have to be opposite teams, so if Matt flips town it's almost guaranteed Keyser is scum.<br><br>But we can come to that game state later. First let's work with Matt!scum -- then Keyser, Uzi, and Grendel are town.

If we let Akarin be town for post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8866260#p8866260\">1806</a>, then it comes down to Nancy and Sheep. Thankfully they cross vote each other in Vote Count 2.1 (when Nancy is still Transcend). It's more likely Nancy is town, because they voted JarJar and Sheep, plus also voting Matt between Vote Count 1.1 and 1.2, meaning they'd have voted for all three scum, although the Nancy/Transcend combo also voted four town in myself/Vifam, Rauth, RC, and Gerry. But that looks more like lost town. Sheep vote parked both days...D1 on Grendel (town) and D2 on Transcend/Nancy. Scum tend to have static reads, and the fact that Sheep didn't really case Grendel or Transcend (ok, he cased Transcend but it was REALLY weak) makes him more likely scum than Transcend/Nancy.<br><br>So tl;dr when I die it goes like this (in order):<br><br>lynch MBG...<br><ul><li>if MBG scum then Sheep -&gt; Nancy -&gt; Akarin is the order for the partner to JJD/MBG. Uzi, Grendel, Keyser are town in this scenario.</li><li>if MBG town then Keyser -&gt; ??? -&gt; ??? ... but Uzi is still town in this scenario. I honestly can't narrow down who Keyser's partner would be in this scenario because he's parked on MBG and Uzi D2, and MBG and Grendel D1, and nobody has voted him in any of these Vote Counts.</li><li>In a really weird scenario where both MBG and Keyser are town, then 2.7 means Nancy was the counterwagon to scum JarJar, so Sheep is confscum here with either Akarin or Grendel.</li><li>Finally, there's some fucked up gamestate where RC and Rauth are both scum with JJD, but I really don't want to think about that. But RC does have that cunning manipulator banner...</li></ul><br>Now I am fine with lynching me if you all need to.</div></blockquote><br><br><br><br>Here's VCA for you TB"}

She has been labelled by Guinness World Records as the most prolific female murderer, though the precise number of her victims is debated. B\u00e1thory and four collaborators were accused of torturing and killing hundreds of young women between 1585 and 1609. The stories of her serial murders and brutality are verified by the testimony of more than 300 witnesses and survivors as well as physical evidence and the presence of horribly mutilated dead, dying and imprisoned girls found at the time of her arrest. Stories which ascribe to her vampire-like tendencies (most famously the tale that she bathed in the blood of virgins to retain her youth) were generally recorded years after her death and are considered unreliable. Her story quickly became part of national folklore, and her infamy persists to this day, with B\u00e1thory known popularly as 'The Blood Countess'.</span></span></span></span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-6]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">Grendel - </span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-6]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">ThinkBig - </span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-6]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">Rautherdir - </span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-4]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">Lil Uzi Vert - RadiantCowbells, ThinkBig </span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-6]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">nancy - </span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-3]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">Cooperative Sheep - Grendel, mattblackguy, Fro99er  </span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-6]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">Keyser S\u00f6ze - </span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-6]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">Fro99er -  </span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-4]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">mattblackguy - Lil Uzi Vert, Keyser S\u00f6ze </span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-6]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">RadiantCowbells - </span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-5]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">No Lynch - Rautherdir</span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"font-size: 125%; line-height: 116%;\">Waiting for their DOOM</span></span> - Cooperative Sheep, nancy  <br><br><br><div style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"font-size: 100%; line-height: 116%;\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Day 3 ends in <span class=\"countdown\"><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">(expired on 2017-03-01 19:45:00)</span></span></span></span></div></fieldset>"}

I can see scum motivation in saying you don't agree with a lynch on a townie, but not trying to counter it with a different wagon because you don't care if the townie gets lynched. The fact that day 1 ended in 2 days though makes all of this meaningless because I will never know if you would eventually try to start a counter wagon. This is why I didn't push you for this reason, because after I said that I understood the day was too short for this to be a substantive read.

She was presumed to have infected 51 people, three of whom died, over the course of her career as a cook. However, as she used many aliases to evade the authorities and worked for many employers for only a short term, the number is likely far higher, including as many as an estimated fifty fatalities.<br><br>While Mallon was not a cold-blooded murderess, her recklessness and felonious irresponsibility makes her no less a killer. Mallon was adamant throughout her life that, despite the omnipresence of typhoid fever around her, she was perfectly healthy and could not be the cause. She rejected the medical science, and denied the utility of handwashing and other precautions that would have prevented her from spreading the disease. After refusing to cooperate with physicians, she was legally compelled to not work as a cook. After only a brief period of compliance, Mallon adopted a pseudonym and returned to work, infecting more people. Ultimately, Typhoid Mary was confined to a quarantine hospital on an island in New York's East River until her death.</span></span></span></span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-6]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">Grendel - </span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-6]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">ThinkBig - </span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-5]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">Rautherdir - RadiantCowbells </span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-4]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">Lil Uzi Vert - mattblackguy, Grendel </span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-6]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">nancy - </span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-6]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">Cooperative Sheep - </span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-6]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">Keyser S\u00f6ze - </span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-6]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">Fro99er -  </span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-2]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">mattblackguy - Lil Uzi Vert, Keyser S\u00f6ze, Fro99er, nancy </span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-6]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">RadiantCowbells - </span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-5]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">No Lynch - Rautherdir</span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"font-size: 125%; line-height: 116%;\">Waiting for their DOOM</span></span> - Cooperative Sheep, ThinkBig <br><br><br><div style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"font-size: 100%; line-height: 116%;\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Day 3 ends in <span class=\"countdown\"><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">(expired on 2017-03-01 19:45:00)</span></span></span></span></div></fieldset>"}

We also offer winter and spring break day camps, and winter camp was this week. As tiring as summer can can be, and as muddy as spring camp can be, winter camp is always the toughest.

Scum definitely would benefit a lot from me being lynched with how strong my role is right now. If I can stop one more kill it will buy us an extra mislynch which scum definitely don't want.<br>(2) Idk, but no lynching is definitely better than mislynching me today. Lynching in VT is preferable to both though. If we can nail the scum in VT then we basically win the game, but if we don't it still narrows down the game a lot if we lynch the right person.

I didn't say they HAD to be in the bottom list. Everything I say is my opinion. Stop reading everything I say like I'm trying to pass off everything as facts, because I'm not. Those bottom were the list of people I wasn't townreading. Now I know you didn't care about any of my answers, which is why I didn't care about answering them in the first place, but just so you don't get continue to be cranky I answered them for you. I want to see if anyone is reading my posts. If you read this far say cheese in your next post. Here I'll give you some good questions.<br><br>(1) If you think I'm scum then who do you think my partner is? You already said you don't think Akarin(ThinkBig), and Sheep are scum. Then who else is there?<br>(2) Since you think I'm scum and want to lynch me you must be pretty sure that scum attacked RC, and that I wasn't the reason for the No Kill. Why do you think scum would attack RC when he already claimed Bulletproof. They can't kill him so what was the purpose of that? It makes 0 sense to me that people actually think this was the most probable reason for the No Kill. Seriously me jailing Rauth, and either protecting Rauth from the kill or preventing Rauth from making the kill makes a lot more sense. But it seems it's easier for people to ignore the facts and just say I'm scum.<br><br><br>I'm not sure about Nancy tbh, but I still don't think JarJar's vote on Transcend was a bus/distancing. His vote on Transcend looked a lot more like scum going for an easy mislynch. Why would Jar bus Transcend at that point in time when there wasn't good reason for him to be lynched? Most of the case against him was policy, and that people didn't like his vague reads. That's not really AI for Transcend afaik.<br><br>I'm not even sure about Rauth anymore. It's so odd for scum!rauth to claim backup cop, and clear the person his partner is tunneling on that I thought it was unlikely that he would flip scum. I basically cleared him as town for just that, but his play so far day 3 isn't good at all. He hasn't really done anything. Honestly Rauth might know that both I, and LUV are both PRs which is why he doesn't want to take a stance here. The fact that he said earlier that he thinks that both me and LUV can both flip town is really shady.  @Rauth, There's almost certainly one scum in the PR claims, and one scum in the VT claims. Which do you think is more likely to be scum, and more likely to be town in each pool.<br><br>No matter who we lynch today, I want Rauth to give his stances on the whole playerlist.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8898442#p8898442\" class=\"postlink\">post 2532</a>, Fro99er wrote:</cite><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: mbg</span><br><br>if this is scum then we win.

If mbg and ThinkBig are Town then scum have no motivation to push off the wagon, if mbg is scum and ThinkBig is Town then scum have motivation to push off the wagon, if mbg is Town and ThinkBig is scum then scum have motivation to push off the wagon. No one attempted to push off the wagon or kill my push, therefore mbg!scum/ThinkBig!Town and mbg!Town/ThinkBig!scum can be reasonably discounted, which leaves scum/scum Town/Town, I don't believe that ThinkBig is scum therefore I believe they are both Town. If you want to argue that Sheep is scum then his jabs at me could be construed as an attempt to kill my push on mbg, but they were pretty weak and he's tunneled on my slot so I'm not really reading them as that. Fro99er's Town motivation comes from following my argumentation without really backing it up with content then flipping back to mbg, this reads like someone who agreed with the argumentation and the benefit of the choice but returned to their stronger read as an emotional response, not someone playing the field or pushing a counterwagon."}

Scum definitely would benefit a lot from me being lynched with how strong my role is right now. If I can stop one more kill it will buy us an extra mislynch which scum definitely don't want.<br>(2) Idk, but no lynching is definitely better than mislynching me today. Lynching in VT is preferable to both though. If we can nail the scum in VT then we basically win the game, but if we don't it still narrows down the game a lot if we lynch the right person. There's a good chance we can sort out the PR claims tomorrow depending on the night actions. <br>(3) No...<br>(4) I'm not going to lie about who I jailed night 1. I knew saying I jailed you night 1 would make people more suspicious of me, but it's what I did. I'm not going to start lying and say I jailed someone else when I didn't. If I was scum lying about my role don't you think it makes more sense for me to lie and say I jailed Grendel? I townread Grendel for mostly the entirety of the game, and no one would be suspicious of me choosing Grendel.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #FF0000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Hmm, yes, WIFOM says scum-you would have just picked your strongest t/read and not me. However, my confusion (or suspicion) is the TIMING of when you started to scum read me. Was it at the start of D2, during your re-read during D1, during a re-read of my ISO D2? It looked to me like you came into D2 scum reading me, so saying you jailed me for being strong-townie was a contradiction. I suspected this contradiction was a SCUM-SLIP. You still need to put down in writing the timescale of your changing read of me.</span></span></span><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8908120#p8908120\" class=\"postlink\">post 2854</a>, Keyser S\u00f6ze wrote:</cite>Please can you explain to me why Rauth's roleclaim meant Grendel, Nancy and Akarin were town?<br><br>...and the 3 scum HAD to be in the bottom list of 5 players.</div></blockquote><br>I was townreading those 3 independent of Rauth. I didn't say they HAD to be in the bottom list. Everything I say is my opinion. Stop reading everything I say like I'm trying to pass off everything as facts, because I'm not. Those bottom were the list of people I wasn't townreading. Now I know you didn't care about any of my answers, which is why I didn't care about answering them in the first place, but just so you don't get continue to be cranky I answered them for you. I want to see if anyone is reading my posts. If you read this far say cheese in your next post. Here I'll give you some good questions.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #FF0000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Cheese.</span></span></span><br><br>(1) If you think I'm scum then who do you think my partner is? You already said you don't think Akarin(ThinkBig), and Sheep are scum. Then who else is there?<br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #FF0000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">I'd prefer to take on one player at a time via their associations with JarJar. I had you and LUV as the prime candidates going into D3. Since then, other players have presented scum-cases via Sheep and ThingBig via your scum-flip. Thus, you can understand how your flip would provide some information. Other players, have ruled out 5 town PR's - thus, many people (including me) don't think ALL the PR's can be town (MGB, Rauth, RC, LUV)</span></span></span><br><br>(2) Since you think I'm scum and want to lynch me you must be pretty sure that scum attacked RC, and that I wasn't the reason for the No Kill. Why do you think scum would attack RC when he already claimed Bulletproof. They can't kill him so what was the purpose of that? It makes 0 sense to me that people actually think this was the most probable reason for the No Kill. Seriously me jailing Rauth, and either protecting Rauth from the kill or preventing Rauth from making the kill makes a lot more sense. But it seems it's easier for people to ignore the facts and just say I'm scum.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #FF0000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">They could have WIFOM'd themselves out of thinking RC was being truthful. Scum may have thought RC was 1-shot bulletproof. That is the main reason for going for a NO LYNCH/not lynching you today though: your supposed jailing of Rauth explains the no NK - Rauth was the obvious night target for scum.</span></span></span></div></blockquote>"}

After serving under Benjamin Hornigold, Teach captured a French merchant vessel, renamed her Queen Anne's Revenge, and equipped her with 40 guns. He became a renowned pirate, his cognomen derived from his thick black beard and fearsome appearance; he was reported to have tied lit fuses under his hat to frighten his enemies.

I like your playstyle, it's interesting. I explicitly avoided reading much of players with fairly vanilla play. You have a few caveats in your game that other players don't have and your fundamentals are good. Your scumgame is better than your towngame because when you're scum you're pulling all the strings. When you're Town you have to actually gain the confidence of others and you can't let them in to what you're doing behind the scenes, which is where the most interesting and meaningful parts of your play are. Reading games is the only way I have to learn outside of my games and as a newbie my newbie games weren't enough. Pine as IC was really helpful but that was only post-game / dead thread and I'm a lot hungrier than that. Other players I read most heavily were Transcend, RedCoyote and kmd."}

Because LUV is the counterwagon, it is very unlikely that LUV is scum. This leaves {Akarin, Grendel, Fro99er}.<br><br>Since I have {Grendel, LUV} as the scumspects on the gerryoat wagon and LUV is counterwagon to JJD, we can provisionally rule LUV out. Which leaves Grendel.<br><br>To return to the original hypothesis, if 1 of {Grendel, Keyser, mbg, Sheep} should be scum and 1 of {Akarin, Rauthedir} should be scum, then Grendel is scum and Rautherdir is scum.<br><br>If you are keen to vote in PRs, vote Rautherdir.

If we assume there are not 5 TPRs then 1 of {mbg, LUV, Rauth} are scum. If they kill mbg then we get a result from either LUV or Rauth and have an educated guess as to who is fakeclaiming. If they kill LUV we may get a result from Rauth, we also have a chance of mbg preventing a kill, either way we have more information to go off and have a 50/50 on a scum lynch. If they kill Rauth we may get a result from LUV, we also have a chance of mbg preventing the kill, either way we have more information to go off and we have a 50/50 on a scum lynch.

I did say I was suspicious of LUV before, and I was even voting him earlier. Rauth hasn't done anything all of day 3. That's why I kept pressuring him to get some reads out there. I don't think he actually reread through the game like he said he did. His reread post was just stupidly bad, and he doesn't even say he thinks Frogger is scum. I don't think Town!Rauth makes that kind of post at this point of the game. I know he's still kinda newbie, but that doesn't mean he's that bad.<br><br>@Keyser, Jesus man I don't even know what you want from me. You been tunneling on this stupid shit for so long. Look I'll say it again. You were Town lean end d1, Town lean start d2, Vifam posts you were strong townread. I get curious on why the townread is strong. I remembered you being townish day 1, but nothing stood out for a strong townread. I read through your ISO to try and get a more solid read on u. I notice something I didn't notice before. You were Town reading Gerry but wasn't opposed to his lynch or try to start a counterwagon. There wasn't much time for u to start a counterwagon day 1 so the latter is null. The former I still don't like but I don't know if that's just a play style thing from you. You wanna lynch scum with me now or you wanna continue tunneling on me because you think I'm a bad player?"}

Capone started small, but expanded his bootlegging business through increasingly violent means. His mutually profitable relationships with mayor William Hale Thompson and the city's police meant that Capone seemed safe from law enforcement. However, the Saint Valentine's Day Massacre of gang rivals, resulting in the killing of seven men in broad daylight, damaged Chicago's image\u2014as well as Capone's\u2014leading influential citizens to demand governmental action and newspapers to dub him \"Public Enemy No. 1\". The federal authorities became intent on jailing Capone, and they prosecuted him for tax evasion in 1931, a federal crime and a novel strategy during the era.

His reread post was just stupidly bad, and he doesn't even say he thinks Frogger is scum. I don't think Town!Rauth makes that kind of post at this point of the game.

He hasn't been like that at all after revealing. I had to force him to contribute, and when he did do a catchup it was a vote for a silly reason especially at this point in the game. I don't buy his \"I don't know why I voted Frog\" story either. Just makes him look worse."}

Possibly the worst serial killer in Australian history, Lynch was a bushranger who murdered and robbed cattle herders and laborers in the trails around Berima. Lynch's murder spree started after he went to the farm of T.B. Humphrey, where he had previously worked, and stole eight cattle before setting out for Sydney, where his intention was to sell them. At Razorback Mountain, he met a man called Ireland along with an Aboriginal boy who were driving a full cattle herd loaded with wheat, bacon and other produce. The cargo was meant to be delivered to Thomas Cowper, who was a stranger to Lynch, and decided it would be more profitable to take Ireland\u2019s load and sell it rather than his initial intention. Early one morning, Ireland asked the boy to help round up the cattle, and once they were away from the camp Lynch crept up behind him and smashed the back of his head with a tomahawk, killing him. Returning to camp while Ireland was making breakfast, Lynch distracted him before crashing the tomahawk into the back of his head, killing him too. Lynch hid both corpses and continued to Sydney to execute his plan with his stolen merchandise. On his way back from Sydney, close to Razorback Mountain, he met a father and son called Frazer, who were driving a cattle herd owned by a Mr Bawten. Lynch fancied this herd and decided he would have to kill the Frazers to get it, accompanying them on their journey. That night, they camped near Cordeaux Flat, and the next morning Lynch killed both men and then buried their bodies. After killing the Frazers, Lynch decided to deal with the Mulligans, who had owed him \u00a330 for stolen goods they had purchased off him. He visited the Mulligan farm and killed the four members of the family before gathering the bodies, built a pyre and set them alight. Lynch claimed to be the new owner of the property, and he bought it off the surviving Mulligans as the family left town without a word to anybody. Lynch was eventually found guilty of the murder of a man named Kearns Landregan, and hanged.</span></span></span></span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-6]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">Grendel - </span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-6]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">ThinkBig - </span><br><span style=\"color: #FF0000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">[LYNCH ACHIEVED]</span></span> <span style=\"font-size: 110%; line-height: 116%;\">Rautherdir - mattblackguy, nancy, Grendel, TheRealGin-N-Tonic, Fro99er, Rautherdir</span></span></span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-6]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">TheRealGin-N-Tonic - </span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-6]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">nancy - </span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-6]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">Cooperative Sheep - </span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-6]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">Keyser S\u00f6ze - </span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-6]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">Fro99er - </span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-5]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">mattblackguy - Cooperative Sheep </span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-6]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">RadiantCowbells - </span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"font-size: 125%; line-height: 116%;\">Waiting for their DOOM</span></span> - ThinkBig, Keyser S\u00f6ze,  RadiantCowbells<br><br><div style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"font-size: 100%; line-height: 116%;\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Day 3 ends NOW</span></span></div></fieldset>"}

English use of longbows was effective against the French during the Hundred Years' War, particularly at the start of the war in the battles of Sluys (1340), Cr\u00e9cy (1346), and Poitiers (1356), and perhaps most famously at the Battle of Agincourt (1415). At Agincourt, it is said that the cream of the French nobility was destroyed, with thousands of knights slaughtered by well-trained commoners wielding these bows, which were effective at incredible range and could punch through even heavy plate. This marked the beginning of the end of specialized and expensive heavy cavalry requiring a noble income, and the beginning of the dominance of trained, professional soldiery.</span></span></span></span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-5]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">Grendel - </span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-5]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">ThinkBig - </span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-5]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">TheRealGin-N-Tonic - </span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-5]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">nancy - </span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-5]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">Cooperative Sheep - </span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-5]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">Fro99er - </span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-5]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">mattblackguy -  </span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-5]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">RadiantCowbells - </span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"font-size: 125%; line-height: 116%;\">Waiting for their DOOM</span></span> - Grendel, ThinkBig, TheRealGin-N-Tonic, nancy, Cooperative Sheep, Fro99er, mattblackguy, RadiantCowbells<br><br><br><div style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"font-size: 100%; line-height: 116%;\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Day 4 ends in <span class=\"countdown\"><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">(expired on 2017-03-19 14:00:00)</span></span></span></span></div></fieldset>"}

Unlike many similar weapons, the pike is not intended to be thrown. Pikes were used regularly in European warfare from the early Middle Ages until around 1700, and were wielded by foot soldiers deployed in close quarters. The pike found extensive use with Landsknecht armies and Swiss mercenaries, who employed it as their main weapon and used it in pike square formations. Where the longbow ended the dominance of knights as the masters of the battlefield, extensive use of pikeman tactics removed the dominance of cavalry entirely until the incorporation of firearms into mounted combat.

They were primarily used to demoralize, injure, and kill entrenched defenders, against whom the indiscriminate and generally very slow-moving or static nature of gas clouds would be most effective. The types of weapons employed ranged from disabling chemicals, such as tear gas, to lethal agents like phosgene, chlorine, and mustard gas. Gas was unlike most other weapons of the period because it was possible to develop effective countermeasures, such as gas masks. In the later stages of the war, as the use of gas increased, its overall effectiveness diminished. The use of gas was emblematic of the way World War I was fought, and why it was so different from all other wars that had been fought to that point. Trench warfare was inhuman, completely impersonal. Gone were the times when the order of the day was one man killing another, now monstrous weapons of science would indiscriminately slaughter hundreds of thousands in a single battle, without ever seeing the faces of those they were killing.</span></span></span></span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-5]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">Grendel - </span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-5]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">ThinkBig - </span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-1]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">TheRealGin-N-Tonic - RadiantCowbells, Cooperative Sheep, ThinkBig, mattblackguy</span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-5]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">nancy - </span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-5]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">Cooperative Sheep - </span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-5]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">Fro99er - </span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-5]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">mattblackguy -  </span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-4]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">RadiantCowbells - TheRealGin-N-Tonic</span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"font-size: 125%; line-height: 116%;\">Waiting for their DOOM</span></span> - Grendel, Fro99er, nancy<br><br><div style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"font-size: 100%; line-height: 116%;\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Day 4 ends in <span class=\"countdown\"><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">(expired on 2017-03-19 14:00:00)</span></span></span></span></div></fieldset>"}

A cascading explosion caused by manipulating certain elements to critical mass, releasing an enormous amount of energy dwarfing anything previously imagined. Atomic bombs are sufficient to devastate entire cities, killing tens or hundreds of thousands in mere minutes, and release many kinds of radiation and electromagnetic pulses. Only two nuclear devices have been deployed in anger, both by the United States against Japan at the end of World War II, driving the Japanese to surrender. The advent of the atomic era presaged an entirely new kind of warfare, where the potential consequences of all-out war between nations so armed became unthinkable, and belligerents took to fighting a cold war of small-scale conflict and the sponsoring of proxy agents, as well as economic and diplomatic antagonism.<br><br>While nuclear war on any scale has never broken out, it remains a specter of doom haunting the descendants of Einstein and Oppenheimer.</span></span></span></span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-5]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">Grendel - </span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-5]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">ThinkBig - </span><br><span style=\"color: #FF0000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;\">[LYNCH ACHIEVED]</span></span> <span style=\"font-size: 110%; line-height: 116%;\">TheRealGin-N-Tonic - RadiantCowbells, Cooperative Sheep, ThinkBig, mattblackguy, nancy</span></span></span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-5]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">nancy - </span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-5]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">Cooperative Sheep - </span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-5]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">Fro99er - </span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-5]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">mattblackguy -  </span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-4]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">RadiantCowbells - TheRealGin-N-Tonic</span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"font-size: 125%; line-height: 116%;\">Waiting for their DOOM</span></span> - Grendel, Fro99er<br><br><div style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"font-size: 100%; line-height: 116%;\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Day 4 ends NOW</span></span></div></fieldset>"}

A weak night light is all that illuminates this next room, concealing what horror lies within. Hands grope in the darkness, until one of you stumbles across a light switch. To your collective surprise, it clicks on, spreading a warm, soft yellow light from several elegant fixtures on the ceiling and sconces on the wall. Blinking, you look around and take a quick head count.<br><br><span style=\"font-size: 125%; line-height: 116%;\">To your surprise, <span class=\"noboldsig\">NO ONE</span> is missing.</span><br><br>You spread out, exploring the small and well-appointed room. Plush leather couches and easy chairs abound, even a small bed with fine Egyptian cotton sheets. A carved oak table braces one wall, set with all manner of food and snacks. Steam rises from a whole honey-baked ham and hot chocolate, and the cookies appear fresh from the oven. Cheese and fruit, wine and soda, bread and beer are laid out, all on a red silk tablecloth. Gilt-framed images of famous massacres and losing battles throughout history are placed evenly around the walls.</span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: darkorange\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Welcome to the Halftime Rest Stop! Nothing in this room will harm you or maim you, stab you or bite you, burn you or mash you. The food isn't poisoned. Really!

As the minutes tick by, you all gradually drift toward the table, the gnawing of your empty stomachs becoming too much to bear. Finally, you give in to nibbles and sip, just to test for hazard. When none of you seem in immediate peril of dropping from anything but hunger, everyone falls to and gorges themselves.<br><br>Some time later, everyone is sprawled out on the furniture nursing one last drink. One adventurous couple (who shall remain nameless) even rigged up a sheet to provide a modicum of privacy to the small bed in the corner...not that it muffled the sounds of their \"relaxation\" much. As the last crumbs of the cookies are licked lazily off of fingers, a chime rings out. Everyone is shaken from their repose, and the couple in the corner hastily tugs on clothing. Above the great oaken table, a slot opens, and a small golden tray slides out from the wall, bearing a single silvery pill.</span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: darkorange\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Time for your reward, children! I do always like to have at least one survivor, and it's that time, kiddies! The pill on the tray before you is the antidote to the drugs I gave you, but there's only one dose.

The incident was heavily propagandized by leading Patriots, such as Paul Revere and Samuel Adams, to fuel animosity toward the British authorities. British troops had been stationed in Boston, capital of the Province of Massachusetts Bay, since 1768 in order to protect and support crown-appointed colonial officials attempting to enforce unpopular Parliamentary legislation. Amid ongoing tense relations between the population and the soldiers, a mob formed around a British sentry, who was subjected to verbal abuse and harassment. He was eventually supported by eight additional soldiers, who were subjected to verbal threats and repeatedly hit by clubs, stones and snowballs. They fired into the crowd, without orders, instantly killing three people and wounding others. Two more people died later of wounds sustained in the incident. The impact of the Boston Massacre is not in the number of people slain in the event, but in the way it resonated with the Patriot cause and fanned the fires of war as an exemplar of British colonial oppression.</span></span></span></span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-4]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">Grendel - </span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-4]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">ThinkBig - </span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-4]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">nancy - </span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-4]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">Cooperative Sheep - </span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-4]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">Fro99er - </span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-4]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">mattblackguy -  </span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-4]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">RadiantCowbells - </span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"font-size: 125%; line-height: 116%;\">Waiting for their DOOM</span></span> - Grendel, ThinkBig, nancy, Cooperative Sheep, Fro99er, mattblackguy, RadiantCowbells<br><br><div style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"font-size: 100%; line-height: 116%;\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Day 5 ends in <span class=\"countdown\"><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">(expired on 2017-03-22 23:30:00)</span></span></span></span></div></fieldset>"}

I jail one of the 4 VT claims, RC tracks 1 of the 4 VT claims. If I die, I confirm 1 unconfirmed VT, and RC confirms 1 unconfirmed VT. During day it's 4 v 1. 3 confirmed town 1 uncofirmed town 1 scum. Lynch one of the unconfirmed.

I found a lot of his play early on forced and felt like he was fence sitting. He's also recently been calling for my head but I don't think he's made any attempt to sort me or even has said why he's scum reading me.  <br><br>I am scum reading Sheep mainly because of his push on the Transcend slot and PoE. <br><br>I didn't get why he was so focused on Transcend during D2 and it sort of pinged me because nothing really stood out to me from Transcend's play. When I looked back at their interactions on D1, all I saw was him explaining to Transcend in a sort of condescending tone about why there was a wagon on Grendel and him confirming who he is to Transcend. The latter came off  more snobbish and patronizing then the former. It read like he was projecting a level of importance that he felt he rightfully earned at that point of the game which was very odd. This lead me to believe throughout my reread that there will be various play style and personality clashes between the two and that a lot of what they'll be scum reading each other for will be overblown.<br><br>At the start of D2, he voted Transcend and then I believe states he voted for him because of effort and his suspect voting pattern on D1. Effort is NAI. The second point however is a valid point but if you take a look back on D1, I believe Transcend voted for at least 4-5 different people before voting for Gerry according to my notes. What Sheep fails to acknowledge is that lot of those votes where in RVS and that scum would prefer not to bring that much attention themselves by voting like it's going out of style. <br><br>Sheep later on questions Transcend about his take on the Gerry and Grendel's wagons but does it in such a way that comes off like he's trying to show others that Transcend is stating his theories as fact. Now I have no idea why Transcend really didn't answer these questions from Sheep but his attitude seemed carefree and just genuine. I think scum would be more alert, more on guard, and try to look as pro-town as possible. Transcend did the exact opposite and while it could've been just an act, I find the simplest explanation always the most probable. <br><br>Here we are now and he's pushing nancy over her claiming immediately on replacement and only looking at the vote counts. Which is weird but doesn't make her scum. The latter however is a very bad angle to push in my opinion. Various players on this site put a lot of stock into VCA and nancy may just be one of them. Wouldn't surprise me to be honest since I've heard a lot of good things about her play. He's essentially scum reading her for play style rather than looking for the motivation of her actions.<br><br>--<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">@Mod: I'll be v/LA till the 16th.

Following a 13-day siege, Mexican troops under President General Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna launched an assault on the Alamo Mission near San Antonio de B\u00e9xar (modern-day San Antonio, Texas, United States), killing all of the Texian defenders. In the early morning hours of March 6, the Mexican Army advanced on the Alamo. After repelling two attacks, the Texians were unable to fend off a third attack. As Mexican soldiers scaled the walls, most of the Texian soldiers withdrew into interior buildings. Defenders unable to reach these points were slain by the Mexican cavalry as they attempted to escape. Between five and seven Texians may have surrendered; if so, they were quickly executed. Most eyewitness accounts reported between 182 and 257 Texians died, while most historians of the Alamo agree that around 600 Mexicans were killed or wounded.  Santa Anna's cruelty during the battle inspired many Texians\u2014both Texas settlers and adventurers from the United States\u2014to join the Texian Army. Buoyed by a desire for revenge, the Texians defeated the Mexican Army at the Battle of San Jacinto, on April 21, 1836, ending the revolution. Among the dead defenders were such legendary pioneers as William Travis, Jim Bowie, and Davy Crockett, who legend would have us believed was found surrounded by fallen Mexican soldiers.</span></span></span></span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-4]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">Grendel - </span><br><span style=\"color: #FF0000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;\">[LYNCH ACHIEVED]</span></span> <span style=\"font-size: 110%; line-height: 116%;\">ThinkBig - RadiantCowbells, mattblackguy, nancy, Fro99er</span></span></span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-4]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">nancy - </span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-4]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">Cooperative Sheep - ThinkBig</span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-4]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">Fro99er - </span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-4]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">mattblackguy -  </span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">[L-4]</span> <span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\">RadiantCowbells - </span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"font-size: 125%; line-height: 116%;\">Waiting for their DOOM</span></span> - Grendel, Cooperative Sheep<br><br><div style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"font-size: 100%; line-height: 116%;\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Day 5 ends NOW!</span></span></div></fieldset>"}

Even the nice new wallpaper is torn down from the walls of the old basement storeroom. Finally, the group turns its sights on the purported escape hatch.

For starters, they're best used sparingly. I'd go several games between attempts, bare minimum. They are also best when they are exaggerations or minimizations of the truth, such as claiming Doc when you're actually a Bodyguard, or Cop as a Hider. My various waffling about my abilities in Clumsy's Curse of Strahd mini is a good example of a Town lie.<br><br>When they're bad is when they're provably or demonstrably falsifiable, or when they're made without a clear-cut and direct agenda. Anything that requires you to produce results that could be found to be wrong is dangerous. Doubling down on investigative roles greatly complicates setup spec. Claiming Tracker would have been just fine as BP, because you might draw the kill onto your shield. But doing so flippantly for a murky reason with a robust investigator already flipped when you've already claimed something else is just unhelpful. The dead thread and I collectively rolled our eyes."}

For starters, they're best used sparingly. I'd go several games between attempts, bare minimum. They are also best when they are exaggerations or minimizations of the truth, such as claiming Doc when you're actually a Bodyguard, or Cop as a Hider. My various waffling about my abilities in Clumsy's Curse of Strahd mini is a good example of a Town lie.<br><br>When they're bad is when they're provably or demonstrably falsifiable, or when they're made without a clear-cut and direct agenda. Anything that requires you to produce results that could be found to be wrong is dangerous. Doubling down on investigative roles greatly complicates setup spec. Claiming Tracker would have been just fine as BP, because you might draw the kill onto your shield. But doing so flippantly for a murky reason with a robust investigator already flipped when you've already claimed something else is just unhelpful. The dead thread and I collectively rolled our eyes.</div></blockquote><br><br>Hm okay. Most of this isn't news to me. <br><br>I often underplay my hand as a strong power role to avoid getting night killed. Like saying I'm a weaker variant of a strong role, Neocop vs role cop. <br><br>Likewise as a middling power role I over play my hand to draw.  Ex claiming full vigilante when I'm actually X-shot. <br><br>Which is like you said. Telling the truth, but leaving out a critical component that would otherwise change how scum interacts with your slot."}
