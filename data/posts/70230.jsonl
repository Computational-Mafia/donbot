Please know them.<br>\n2. Be nice. I will be the arbiter of what 'nice' is. I am pretty tolerant about this but there is a line.<br>\n3. Do not discuss the game outside the game thread, except with the moderator, unless your Role PM specifies that you may do so. Do not discuss other ongoing games in this thread or in any topics you might have access to.<br>\n4. You may ask me questions either in the thread or via PM. For some questions, I may be willing to answer via PM but not in-thread for a variety of reasons. <br>\n5. Do not quote private communication with me directly. Paraphrasing is acceptable; if you're not sure whether a post violates this rule, ask me or don't post it. You also may not pretend to quote communications with me. This includes your Role PM.<br>\n6. My color is <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:darkorange\">DARK ORANGE</div></div>; please don't use it.<br>\n7. No dice tags or otherwise provably arbitrary algorithms.<br>\n8. Do not attempt to emulate out-of-thread communication using encryption or hidden/obscured text.<br>\n9. Don't do things you know you shouldn't do, even if I've neglected to include a rule on the matter. Likewise, attempts to circumvent these rules via semantics will be treated harshly.<br>\n10. I reserve the right to warn, force-replace, or modkill as I deem necessary. Don't push it.<br>\n11. I reserve the right to add to or change the rules.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"font-size: 200%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Procedural Rules</div><br>\n<br>\n1. If you wish to vote for a player, please use vote tags or bold tags. That said, if you forget the tags, your vote will still count if it is clear to me that a vote was intended.<br>\n2. A player is considered lynched when he or she reaches a number of votes equal to half the number of living players rounded down plus one.<br>\n3. You may continue discussion in twilight before I show up and lock the thread. Do not post after I officially state that you are dead.<br>\n4. If no majority is reached by deadline there will be No Lynch.<br>\n5. Days will have a non-negotiable deadline of 2 weeks. I may choose to extend a deadline in special circumstances, but it's unlikely. Don't count on it.<br>\n6. Nights last 48 hours.<br>\n7. Prods go out after 48 hours. Failure to post in a timely fashion after a prod, or accumulating several prods, may result in force replacement at my discretion.<br>\n8. A single mafia member can both kill and take another action.<br>\n9.

A fresh wave of dizziness greets you as you sit up, surrounded by twelve other people in various stages of their own groggy awakenings. Looking around, you see a moldering old room, appearing to be a stripped-down old storeroom or basement. The only illumination comes from a pair of bare incandescent bulbs hanging from wires on the ceiling. By its dim light, a series of framed portraits, incongruous for their elegance, may be discerned. They depicts a different instrument of torture and interrogation, each more unsettling than the last. A caption beneath each image tells the story of that devious device, delighting in the perverse. A few ratty old couches are the only other furnishings, and an imposing steel door covered in cruelly-barbed spikes bars the only exit.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:darkorange\">Yessss...that's it, children, time to wake up!

I have therefore elected to introduce a little...healthy competition. Some survival of the fittest, if you will! Some among you have received a little extra perk in your Pick Me Up, a special concoction designed to increase bloodlust and obedience. These, my minions, will only receive the antidote if they can overpower and help me murder the rest of you.<br>\n<br>\n\"The first door may be bypassed only with a blood sacrifice.

It's not a smoking gun, but if he's scum you've done actions that I can easily describe as defensive and deflective for the slot while also doing some sort of vague either-or setup for no discernible reason. It reads to me as a soft setup to allow you to push a false argument (one of them is scum, options open) but when questioned on it you kind of did an awkward defense of both. I think it reads as softly scummy in general, and if Gerry is scum I could see it as defense.

Each of you can feel a crawling, vaguely burning sensation in your extremities, a sure sign that Pine's Pick Me up is working to achieve its fatal effect.<br>\n<br>\nThe arguing and backbiting reaches a fever pitch, and the crowd begins shoving. Some cower in the corner, trying to look small and unthreatening. Others begin grabbing, frantically trying to make sure that someone, anyone, other than themselves is sacrificed to the evil plotter's twisted designs. Finally the scuffle reaches a crescendo, and Gerryoat is thrown forward. As the wickedly sharp tines of the great iron door prod at his back, Gerryoat raises a hand, preparing to scream out a warning. Too late, Vifam barrels into the poor victim without heeding his final plea, impaling him upon the barbs.<br>\n<br>\nGerryoat twitches pathetically, like a fish on the hook, raising again his outstretched hand. The only sound that escapes is a sickening death rattle, and the light fades from his eyes. A shining golden shield tumbles from his hand as it falls limp by his side.</div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"font-size: 125%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Gerryoat has died, impaled upon a barbed iron door. He was a <div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF00\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Town Cop</div></div>.</div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:darkorange\">Oh, goody!

Think not that this shall be your only loss on the way, my friends!</div></div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">The door swings slowly open, leaving a thick trail of Gerryoat's blood as his feet trail along the floor. Cautiously, you all file through the door, stepping out onto a long catwalk, high above a shadowed floor. As soon as the last of you step out onto the catwalk, the overhead lights suddenly switch off with an ominous, hollow sound.</div>", "time": "Wed Feb 01, 2017 9:40 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=70230&start=650", "forum": "53", "thread": "70230"}

The fact that day 1 only lasted 3 days could have contributed to the fact that he didn't try to make a wagon, and nothing else really concerned me about Keyser, but I'm still keeping it open.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: 890</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\"><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8816732#p8816732\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8816732#p8816732\" data-post-id=\"8816732\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 890</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=27626\">Grendel</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8799482#p8799482\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8799482#p8799482\" data-post-id=\"8799482\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 559</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=29122\">mattblackguy</a> wrote:</cite>\n<br>\n{Alisae,Grendel}<br>\n{RC,Keyser,Sheep}<br>\n{Vifam}<br>\n{Gerry,JarJar}<br>\n<br>\nI'm fine with a Gerry lynch today, but I don't think 464 should ever come from any non-newbie town player.<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: JarJar</span></div></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8799773#p8799773\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8799773#p8799773\" data-post-id=\"8799773\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 578</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=29122\">mattblackguy</a> wrote:</cite>Which is why I'm more confident on my read of you and Grendel than a few others.</div></blockquote>\n\nWhy were you town reading me? <br>\n<br>\nI usually remember when someone town reads me, but for some reason seeing this surprised me. <br>\n<br>\nAlso your Jar jar read.

The tone was genuine, and all his points so far toward RC are valid concerns yet everyone is ignoring him.\" As far as RC goes Jar expressed a lot of my concerns, but RC really strengthened my read on him with his bullshit push on me.

The animals were trained and versatile, able to kill victims immediately or to torture them slowly over a prolonged period. Most commonly employed by royalty, the elephants were used to signify both the ruler's absolute power and his ability to control wild animals.<br>\n<br>\nThe sight of elephants executing captives both horrified and attracted the interest of European travelers, and was recorded in numerous contemporary journals and accounts of life in Asia. The practice was eventually suppressed by the European empires that colonised the region in the 18th and 19th centuries. While primarily confined to Asia, the practice was occasionally adopted by Western powers, such as Ancient Rome and Carthage, particularly to deal with mutinous soldiers.</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-6]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Grendel - </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-5]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Akarin - Vifam </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-4]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Rautherdir - RadiantCowbells, Transcend </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-6]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">JarJarDrinks - </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-6]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Lil Uzi Vert - </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-3]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Transcend - Cooperative Sheep, Rautherdir, JarJarDrinks  </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-6]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Cooperative Sheep - </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-6]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Keyser S&#246;ze - </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-5]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Vifam - Akarin  </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-4]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">mattblackguy - Keyser S&#246;ze, Lil Uzi Vert </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-5]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">RadiantCowbells - mattblackguy </div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"font-size: 125%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Waiting for their DOOM</div></div> - Grendel <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\"><div style=\"font-size: 100%; line-height: normal; display: inline\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Day 2 ends in <span class=\"countdown\">(expired on 2017-02-17 18:00:00)</span></div></div></div></fieldset>", "time": "Mon Feb 06, 2017 4:20 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=70230&start=975", "forum": "53", "thread": "70230"}

The process involved tying the condemned prisoner to a wooden frame, usually in a public place. The flesh was then cut from the body in multiple slices in a process that was not specified in detail in Chinese law, and therefore most likely varied. The punishment worked on three levels: as a form of public humiliation, as a slow and lingering death, and as a punishment after death.

This elaborate technique combined several other means of killing a man into one complex ritual, as the victim was first bound to a wooden framework and either marched or dragged to the site, then hanged by the neck nearly to the point of death. The barely-conscious criminal was then cut down, castrated, and disemboweled. Their innards and genitals were then burned in front of them. Then the victims limbs were bound to four horses and stretched to the point of breaking and tearing, and finally the executioner killed them with a blow to the body with an axe or sword. The dead man's limbs were severed and sent to be displayed in the four corners of the realm, while their head was cut off to be displayed prominently in the capital.

The sailor was tied to a line that looped beneath the vessel, thrown overboard on one side of the ship, and dragged under the ship's keel, either from one side of the ship to the other, or the length of the ship (from bow to stern). As the hull was usually covered in barnacles and other marine growth, if the offender was pulled quickly, keelhauling would typically result in serious cuts, loss of limbs and even decapitation. If the offending sailor was merely to be punished, they would be keelhauled along the beam (the widest part of the ship), though this could still maim or kill. Keelhauling along the entire length of the ship usually resulted in death, whether from drowning, blunt force trauma, or simply being shredded apart by barnacles.</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-6]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Grendel - </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-6]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Akarin - </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-6]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Rautherdir - </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-4]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">JarJarDrinks - Akarin, RadiantCowbells </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-5]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Lil Uzi Vert - mattblackguy </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-5]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">nancy - Cooperative Sheep      </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-6]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Cooperative Sheep - </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-6]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Keyser S&#246;ze - </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-6]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Vifam - </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-5]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">mattblackguy - Keyser S&#246;ze  </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-5]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">RadiantCowbells - nancy </div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"font-size: 125%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Waiting for their DOOM</div></div> - Rautherdir, Vifam, JarJarDrinks, Grendel, Lil Uzi Vert<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\"><div style=\"font-size: 100%; line-height: normal; display: inline\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Day 2 ends in <span class=\"countdown\">(expired on 2017-02-17 18:00:00)</span></div></div></div></fieldset>", "time": "Sat Feb 11, 2017 11:36 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=70230&start=1300", "forum": "53", "thread": "70230"}

Specifically him calling out Ali for being too defensive and then trying to link him to Grendel. I've played a few games with Gerry and he always either says RVS/the start of the game is pointless or he just whines about it and then doesn't return to the game until about 15 or 20 pages later. I found it a bit odd that he was spamming it up in early when he usually posts fluff along with attempts to game solve when the game has significantly gotten out of that stage. <br>\n<br>\nThe worst of it obviously was when he accused RC of trying to drag the game back into RVS because of the naked vote RC casted on Rauth. My read as a result only worsen as the back and forth between him and RC just seemed like a combination of taunting and provoking which I did not see the town motivation at all for.<br>\n<br>\nAs for Rauth, the way you phrased your request just seemed weird. I didn't see an issue with his play early on so I was wondering why you were sort of forcing him to come out of his shell rather than letting things develop more and seeing if and how he reacts.<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8848021#p8848021\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8848021#p8848021\" data-post-id=\"8848021\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 1323</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=25845\">Keyser S&#246;ze</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8814397#p8814397\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8814397#p8814397\" data-post-id=\"8814397\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 815</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=28406\">Lil Uzi Vert</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8800949#p8800949\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8800949#p8800949\" data-post-id=\"8800949\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 607</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=23679\">JarJarDrinks</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8800908#p8800908\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8800908#p8800908\" data-post-id=\"8800908\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 599</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=28406\">Lil Uzi Vert</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8796513#p8796513\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8796513#p8796513\" data-post-id=\"8796513\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 390</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=23679\">JarJarDrinks</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8790964#p8790964\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8790964#p8790964\" data-post-id=\"8790964\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 114</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=29064\">Rautherdir</a> wrote:</cite>I have no idea what is happening but I guess it's RVS so I'll just vote someone.<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Akarin</span></div></blockquote>\nScummy post</div></blockquote>\n\nNo, your reply is the actually definition of scummy.

From a scumhunting perspective, scum are more cooperative when they think you like them and town are more cooperative when they think you dislike them. The way I saw it when I replaced in, the game was on a somewhat precarious balance where Town was divided in opinion over the RC slot and the Vifam slot. I was 90% sure RC was Town and pushed the fuck out of it to eliminate the remaining 10% and stop Town from derailing itself on Transcend. RC was almost policy if that Transcend lynch went through. I basically fucked up the creeping opposition to townbloc and clarified the positions of a few slots that were previously murky, so I'm not about to apologize for the WIFOM.<br>\n<br>\n@LUV I'm not pushing for a Grendel lynch right now. I'm not hiding my read on him because he's widely TRed and I don't want that to be a blindspot should I die, but there's no action there at this time.<br>\n<br>\n@RC I don't think we should lynch LUV today. I'm not sold on this being scum. Let me pocket him and we can reconsider once we have a flip or two. This slot isn't a threat right now.<br>\n<br>\n@Grendel why do you have Vifam as a TR?<br>\n<br>\n@Town there's no reason to hammer a lynch with this much time left in the Day. Even if we agree on a lynch we can just leave it at L-2 until we get closer to deadline and capitalize on that time by scumhunting. Sheep, Vifam, and matt are probably the most contested slots right now, so we should focus our attentions there.", "time": "Sat Feb 11, 2017 8:14 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=70230&start=1400", "forum": "53", "thread": "70230"}

Usually, all members of the group are instructed to fire simultaneously, thus preventing both disruption of the process by a single member and identification of the member who fired the lethal shot. To avoid the disfigurement of multiple shots to the head, the shooters are typically instructed to aim at the heart, sometimes aided by a paper target. The prisoner is typically blindfolded or hooded, as well as restrained, although in some cases prisoners have asked to be allowed to face the firing squad without their eyes covered. Executions can be carried out with the condemned either standing or sitting. There is a tradition in some jurisdictions that such executions are carried out at first light, or at sunrise, which is usually up to half an hour later. This gave rise to the phrase \"shot at dawn.\"<br>\n<br>\nExecution by firing squad is distinct from other forms of execution by firearms, such as an execution by a single firearm to the back of the head or neck. However, the single shot by the squad's officer with a pistol (coup de gr&#226;ce) is sometimes incorporated in a firing squad execution, particularly if the initial volley turns out not to be immediately fatal.</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-6]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Grendel - </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-6]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Akarin - </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-6]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Rautherdir - </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"font-size: 125%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">[L-1]</div></div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">JarJarDrinks - Akarin, nancy, Grendel, Lil Uzi Vert, Fro99er</div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-3]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Lil Uzi Vert - mattblackguy, Keyser S&#246;ze, RadiantCowbells </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-4]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">nancy - Cooperative Sheep, JarJarDrinks     </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-6]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Cooperative Sheep - </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-6]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Keyser S&#246;ze - </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-6]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Fro99er - </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-6]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">mattblackguy -   </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-6]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">RadiantCowbells - </div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"font-size: 125%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Waiting for their DOOM</div></div> - Rautherdir<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\"><div style=\"font-size: 100%; line-height: normal; display: inline\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Day 2 ends in <span class=\"countdown\">(expired on 2017-02-17 18:00:00)</span></div></div></div></fieldset>", "time": "Sun Feb 12, 2017 10:21 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=70230&start=1450", "forum": "53", "thread": "70230"}

Usually, all members of the group are instructed to fire simultaneously, thus preventing both disruption of the process by a single member and identification of the member who fired the lethal shot. To avoid the disfigurement of multiple shots to the head, the shooters are typically instructed to aim at the heart, sometimes aided by a paper target. The prisoner is typically blindfolded or hooded, as well as restrained, although in some cases prisoners have asked to be allowed to face the firing squad without their eyes covered. Executions can be carried out with the condemned either standing or sitting. There is a tradition in some jurisdictions that such executions are carried out at first light, or at sunrise, which is usually up to half an hour later. This gave rise to the phrase \"shot at dawn.\"<br>\n<br>\nExecution by firing squad is distinct from other forms of execution by firearms, such as an execution by a single firearm to the back of the head or neck. However, the single shot by the squad's officer with a pistol (coup de gr&#226;ce) is sometimes incorporated in a firing squad execution, particularly if the initial volley turns out not to be immediately fatal.</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-6]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Grendel - </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-6]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Akarin - </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-6]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Rautherdir - </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"font-size: 125%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">[L-1]</div></div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">JarJarDrinks - Akarin, nancy, Grendel, Lil Uzi Vert, Fro99er</div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-3]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Lil Uzi Vert - mattblackguy, Keyser S&#246;ze, RadiantCowbells </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-4]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">nancy - Cooperative Sheep, JarJarDrinks     </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-6]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Cooperative Sheep - </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-6]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Keyser S&#246;ze - </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-6]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Fro99er - </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-6]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">mattblackguy -   </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-6]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">RadiantCowbells - </div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"font-size: 125%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Waiting for their DOOM</div></div> - Rautherdir<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\"><div style=\"font-size: 100%; line-height: normal; display: inline\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Day 2 ends in <span class=\"countdown\">(expired on 2017-02-17 18:00:00)</span></div></div></div></fieldset></div></blockquote>", "time": "Mon Feb 13, 2017 12:25 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=70230&start=1600", "forum": "53", "thread": "70230"}

{"number": 1664, "id": "8854080", "user": "Lil Uzi Vert", "user_id": "28406", "content": "@Keyser: I think I already went over why I'm scum reading Matt but if I haven't I'll do so again.  I found a lot of his play early on forced and felt like he was fence sitting. He's also recently been calling for my head but I don't think he's made any attempt to sort me or even has said why he's scum reading me.  <br>\n<br>\nI am scum reading Sheep mainly because of his push on the Transcend slot and PoE. <br>\n<br>\nI didn't get why he was so focused on Transcend during D2 and it sort of pinged me because nothing really stood out to me from Transcend's play. When I looked back at their interactions on D1, all I saw was him explaining to Transcend in a sort of condescending tone about why there was a wagon on Grendel and him confirming who he is to Transcend. The latter came off  more snobbish and patronizing then the former. It read like he was projecting a level of importance that he felt he rightfully earned at that point of the game which was very odd. This lead me to believe throughout my reread that there will be various play style and personality clashes between the two and that a lot of what they'll be scum reading each other for will be overblown.<br>\n<br>\nAt the start of D2, he voted Transcend and then I believe states he voted for him because of effort and his suspect voting pattern on D1. Effort is NAI. The second point however is a valid point but if you take a look back on D1, I believe Transcend voted for at least 4-5 different people before voting for Gerry according to my notes. What Sheep fails to acknowledge is that lot of those votes where in RVS and that scum would prefer not to bring that much attention themselves by voting like it's going out of style. <br>\n<br>\nSheep later on questions Transcend about his take on the Gerry and Grendel's wagons but does it in such a way that comes off like he's trying to show others that Transcend is stating his theories as fact. Now I have no idea why Transcend really didn't answer these questions from Sheep but his attitude seemed carefree and just genuine. I think scum would be more alert, more on guard, and try to look as pro-town as possible. Transcend did the exact opposite and while it could've been just an act, I find the simplest explanation always the most probable. <br>\n<br>\nHere we are now and he's pushing nancy over her claiming immediately on replacement and only looking at the vote counts. Which is weird but doesn't make her scum. The latter however is a very bad angle to push in my opinion. Various players on this site put a lot of stock into VCA and nancy may just be one of them. Wouldn't surprise me to be honest since I've heard a lot of good things about her play. He's essentially scum reading her for play style rather than looking for the motivation of her actions.<br>\n<br>\n--<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">@Mod: I'll be v/LA till the 16th.

JarJarDrinks is at first disdainful of the accusations, but they quickly grow in momentum as the group turns on him. JarJarDrinks is relentlessly shoved forward. He quails away from the silken pullcord, regarding it as if it were a fanged serpent. Eventually he is shoved down next to it, falling to his knees, and a hand reaches out to yank the cord. As JarJarDrinks screams and tries to scramble away, the rest of you bolt. A deep gong sound echoes through the room, and a hatch in the ceiling opens, dropping a giant stone onto JarJarDrinks, smashing him into pulp against the floor, shattering a giant hole down to the next level.</div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"font-size: 125%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">JarJarDrinks has died, crushed beneath an enormous stone!

Gilles de Rais served as a commander in the French Royal Army, and fought against the English and their Burgundian allies during the Hundred Years' War, for which he was appointed Marshal of France. After retiring from the military de Rais was accused of engaging in a series of child murders, with victims possibly numbering in the hundreds. The killings came to an end in 1440, when a violent dispute with a clergyman led to an ecclesiastical investigation which brought the crimes to light, and attributed them to Gilles. He was condemned to death and hanged at Nantes on 26 October 1440.</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-6]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Grendel - </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-6]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Akarin - </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-6]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Rautherdir - </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-6]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Lil Uzi Vert - </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-6]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">nancy - </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-6]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Cooperative Sheep - </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-6]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Keyser S&#246;ze - </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-6]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Fro99er - </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-6]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">mattblackguy - </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-6]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">RadiantCowbells - </div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"font-size: 125%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Waiting for their DOOM</div></div> - Grendel, Akarin, Rautherdir, Lil Uzi Vert, nancy, Cooperative Sheep, Keyser S&#246;ze, Fro99er, mattblackguy, RadiantCowbells<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\"><div style=\"font-size: 100%; line-height: normal; display: inline\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Day 3 ends in <span class=\"countdown\">(expired on 2017-03-01 19:50:00)</span></div></div></div></fieldset>", "time": "Wed Feb 15, 2017 1:49 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=70230&start=1725", "forum": "53", "thread": "70230"}

Said I was scum for scumreading Jar for a weak reason, and then townreading him day 2, but Vifam(his slot) did the same exact thing. Says I'm scum because I didn't want to policy lynch transcend and announced he was at L-1. Then misrepresented my reason for not hammering Transcend (he said it was only because my scumreads were on the wagon, but ignorned the fact that I didn't want to policy lynch). Says I'm confirmed scum because he doesn't like my reads post.<br>\n3. After his back and forth with Jar he backed off of Jar, and started pushing me even though there was nothing that Jar said that warranted him to back off of him.

If MBG is scum, then my post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8866237#p8866237\">1805</a> shows Grendel is 100% town and my post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8867697#p8867697\">1815</a> shows Keyser is 100% town (which fits with the assumption).<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">The alternative is that Keyser is scum if Matt flips town</div>, and that would make sense given how they voted together D1 (and keyser voted matt), and then voted against each other D2, but ultimately ended up on the same wagon in Vote Count 2.7. They basically have to be opposite teams, so if Matt flips town it's almost guaranteed Keyser is scum.<br>\n<br>\nBut we can come to that game state later. First let's work with Matt!scum -- then Keyser, Uzi, and Grendel are town.

If we let Akarin be town for post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8866260#p8866260\">1806</a>, then it comes down to Nancy and Sheep. Thankfully they cross vote each other in Vote Count 2.1 (when Nancy is still Transcend). It's more likely Nancy is town, because they voted JarJar and Sheep, plus also voting Matt between Vote Count 1.1 and 1.2, meaning they'd have voted for all three scum, although the Nancy/Transcend combo also voted four town in myself/Vifam, Rauth, RC, and Gerry. But that looks more like lost town. Sheep vote parked both days...D1 on Grendel (town) and D2 on Transcend/Nancy. Scum tend to have static reads, and the fact that Sheep didn't really case Grendel or Transcend (ok, he cased Transcend but it was REALLY weak) makes him more likely scum than Transcend/Nancy.<br>\n<br>\nSo tl;dr when I die it goes like this (in order):<br>\n<br>\nlynch MBG...\n<ul><li>if MBG scum then Sheep -&gt; Nancy -&gt; Akarin is the order for the partner to JJD/MBG.

I found a lot of his play early on forced and felt like he was fence sitting. He's also recently been calling for my head but I don't think he's made any attempt to sort me or even has said why he's scum reading me.  <br>\n<br>\nI am scum reading Sheep mainly because of his push on the Transcend slot and PoE. <br>\n<br>\nI didn't get why he was so focused on Transcend during D2 and it sort of pinged me because nothing really stood out to me from Transcend's play. When I looked back at their interactions on D1, all I saw was him explaining to Transcend in a sort of condescending tone about why there was a wagon on Grendel and him confirming who he is to Transcend. The latter came off  more snobbish and patronizing then the former. It read like he was projecting a level of importance that he felt he rightfully earned at that point of the game which was very odd. This lead me to believe throughout my reread that there will be various play style and personality clashes between the two and that a lot of what they'll be scum reading each other for will be overblown.<br>\n<br>\nAt the start of D2, he voted Transcend and then I believe states he voted for him because of effort and his suspect voting pattern on D1. Effort is NAI. The second point however is a valid point but if you take a look back on D1, I believe Transcend voted for at least 4-5 different people before voting for Gerry according to my notes. What Sheep fails to acknowledge is that lot of those votes where in RVS and that scum would prefer not to bring that much attention themselves by voting like it's going out of style. <br>\n<br>\nSheep later on questions Transcend about his take on the Gerry and Grendel's wagons but does it in such a way that comes off like he's trying to show others that Transcend is stating his theories as fact. Now I have no idea why Transcend really didn't answer these questions from Sheep but his attitude seemed carefree and just genuine. I think scum would be more alert, more on guard, and try to look as pro-town as possible. Transcend did the exact opposite and while it could've been just an act, I find the simplest explanation always the most probable. <br>\n<br>\nHere we are now and he's pushing nancy over her claiming immediately on replacement and only looking at the vote counts. Which is weird but doesn't make her scum. The latter however is a very bad angle to push in my opinion. Various players on this site put a lot of stock into VCA and nancy may just be one of them. Wouldn't surprise me to be honest since I've heard a lot of good things about her play. He's essentially scum reading her for play style rather than looking for the motivation of her actions.<br>\n<br>\n--<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">@Mod: I'll be v/LA till the 16th.

Said I was scum for scumreading Jar for a weak reason, and then townreading him day 2, but Vifam(his slot) did the same exact thing. Says I'm scum because I didn't want to policy lynch transcend and announced he was at L-1. Then misrepresented my reason for not hammering Transcend (he said it was only because my scumreads were on the wagon, but ignorned the fact that I didn't want to policy lynch). Says I'm confirmed scum because he doesn't like my reads post.<br>\n3. After his back and forth with Jar he backed off of Jar, and started pushing me even though there was nothing that Jar said that warranted him to back off of him.

He scumread on ne was super weak and nongenuine but tried to push it off as truth. Seriously look at his reasons for scumreading me yesterday. Said I was scum for scumreading Jar for a weak reason, and then townreading him day 2, but Vifam(his slot) did the same exact thing. Says I'm scum because I didn't want to policy lynch transcend and announced he was at L-1. Then misrepresented my reason for not hammering Transcend (he said it was only because my scumreads were on the wagon, but ignorned the fact that I didn't want to policy lynch). Says I'm confirmed scum because he doesn't like my reads post.<br>\n3. After his back and forth with Jar he backed off of Jar, and started pushing me even though there was nothing that Jar said that warranted him to back off of him.

There's no way he just latches into fake claims and wuickhammers as town. He thinks far better than that as town. You were in AngryPig's game with us. Yes it's a bit burdened by proficiency that I'm doing to him, but it's less so that and more so his read on you was really one-dimensional and was all about your claim. Which he should realize is something you can do as both alignments, yet he never gave the town option consideration. Plus there were some associatives with MBG and sheep which is obviously not that credible of a reason to you. But to me it counted a bit.<br>\n<br>\nUzi is harder to explain. Can you not see how his push in Sheep is actually really good? I think so anyway. I get what youbsee between him and Jar, but I think it's more than offset by other town things like that push. I get it from your point of view. I'm just quite convinced and I honestly cannot explain it any further.

His entrance of the game reads like a super hard bus on JarJar to try and gain towncred<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF0000\">It looks like a super hard bus, but he won no towncred for exactly those reasons. People still want him dead today.</div></div><br>\n<br>\n2. He scumread on me was super weak and nongenuine but tried to push it off as truth. Seriously look at his reasons for scumreading me yesterday. Said I was scum for scumreading Jar for a weak reason, and then townreading him day 2, but Vifam(his slot) did the same exact thing. Says I'm scum because I didn't want to policy lynch transcend and announced he was at L-1. Then misrepresented my reason for not hammering Transcend (he said it was only because my scumreads were on the wagon, but ignorned the fact that I didn't want to policy lynch). Says I'm confirmed scum because he doesn't like my reads post.<br>\n3. After his back and forth with Jar he backed off of Jar, and started pushing me even though there was nothing that Jar said that warranted him to back off of him. He then pushed me, and tried to get others to push me because he knew it would be better to get a mislynch on me first before lynching Jar day 3.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF0000\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Scum-Fro99er would have just kept to his bus-plan and finished off the job on JarJar. JarJar was a dead man. If scum-Fro99er had pushed through a 'miss-lynch' on you, his name and word would have meant nothing by D3.</div></div><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Frog</span><br>\n<br>\nGood shit RC.

The name \"Jack the Ripper\" originated in a letter written by someone claiming to be the murderer that was disseminated in the media. Attacks ascribed to Jack the Ripper typically involved female prostitutes who lived and worked in the slums of the East End of London whose throats were cut prior to abdominal mutilations. The removal of internal organs from at least three of the victims led to proposals that their killer had some anatomical or surgical knowledge. \"Jack\" was never caught, and great fascination through the years has been devoted to speculation on his (or her) identity.

He came to power by uniting many of the nomadic tribes of Northeast Asia. After founding the Empire and being proclaimed \"Genghis Khan\", he started the Mongol invasions that conquered most of Eurasia. In just a few short decades, Genghis Khan would conquer most of what is now Central Asia, China, Korea, the Middle East, Russia (minus Siberia and Kamchatka), and Eastern Europe. He and sons and grandsons conquered more territory than any other empire in history, dwarfing both the Romans, Macedonians, as well as the colonial powers of later centuries. Their dominion was built on the blood and corpses of their enemies, as they would execute the populations of entire cities who refused to surrender. Mongol warriors were frequently given a quota of executions they had to perform before being allowed to rape and pillage.

Mao&#8217;s rule, with its economic mismanagement and continual political upheavals, also spelled poverty for the bulk of China&#8217;s enormous population. His policies were also designed to massively inflate the Chinese population, as he felt that nuclear war was inevitable, and hoped that mere thousands of surviving Europeans, Russians, and Americans could be overwhelmed by millions of Chinese survivors of nuclear holocaust. This inflation of the Chinese population helped drive further scarcity and reliance on agrarian economic systems. Between 45 and 60 million Chinese were killed under Mao's tenure, perhaps more than the purges of Hitler and Stalin combined, rivaled only by the most horrific estimates of the Mongol conquests under Temujin.</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-6]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Grendel - </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-6]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Akarin - </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-6]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Rautherdir - </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-6]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Lil Uzi Vert - </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-5]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">nancy - RadiantCowbells </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-4]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Cooperative Sheep - Grendel, mattblackguy </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-6]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Keyser S&#246;ze - </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-5]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Fro99er - Fro99er  </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-4]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">mattblackguy - Lil Uzi Vert, Keyser S&#246;ze </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-6]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">RadiantCowbells - </div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-5]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">No Lynch - Rautherdir</div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"font-size: 125%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Waiting for their DOOM</div></div> - Akarin, Cooperative Sheep, nancy <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\"><div style=\"font-size: 100%; line-height: normal; display: inline\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Day 3 ends in <span class=\"countdown\">(expired on 2017-03-01 19:45:00)</span></div></div></div></fieldset>", "time": "Sun Feb 19, 2017 1:09 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=70230&start=2275", "forum": "53", "thread": "70230"}

If MBG is scum, then my post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8866237#p8866237\">1805</a> shows Grendel is 100% town and my post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8867697#p8867697\">1815</a> shows Keyser is 100% town (which fits with the assumption).<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">The alternative is that Keyser is scum if Matt flips town</div>, and that would make sense given how they voted together D1 (and keyser voted matt), and then voted against each other D2, but ultimately ended up on the same wagon in Vote Count 2.7. They basically have to be opposite teams, so if Matt flips town it's almost guaranteed Keyser is scum.<br>\n<br>\nBut we can come to that game state later. First let's work with Matt!scum -- then Keyser, Uzi, and Grendel are town.

If we let Akarin be town for post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8866260#p8866260\">1806</a>, then it comes down to Nancy and Sheep. Thankfully they cross vote each other in Vote Count 2.1 (when Nancy is still Transcend). It's more likely Nancy is town, because they voted JarJar and Sheep, plus also voting Matt between Vote Count 1.1 and 1.2, meaning they'd have voted for all three scum, although the Nancy/Transcend combo also voted four town in myself/Vifam, Rauth, RC, and Gerry. But that looks more like lost town. Sheep vote parked both days...D1 on Grendel (town) and D2 on Transcend/Nancy. Scum tend to have static reads, and the fact that Sheep didn't really case Grendel or Transcend (ok, he cased Transcend but it was REALLY weak) makes him more likely scum than Transcend/Nancy.<br>\n<br>\nSo tl;dr when I die it goes like this (in order):<br>\n<br>\nlynch MBG...\n<ul><li>if MBG scum then Sheep -&gt; Nancy -&gt; Akarin is the order for the partner to JJD/MBG. Uzi, Grendel, Keyser are town in this scenario.<br>\n</li><li>if MBG town then Keyser -&gt; ??? -&gt; ??? ... but Uzi is still town in this scenario. I honestly can't narrow down who Keyser's partner would be in this scenario because he's parked on MBG and Uzi D2, and MBG and Grendel D1, and nobody has voted him in any of these Vote Counts.<br>\n</li><li>In a really weird scenario where both MBG and Keyser are town, then 2.7 means Nancy was the counterwagon to scum JarJar, so Sheep is confscum here with either Akarin or Grendel.<br>\n</li><li>Finally, there's some fucked up gamestate where RC and Rauth are both scum with JJD, but I really don't want to think about that. But RC does have that cunning manipulator banner...</li></ul>\n\nNow I am fine with lynching me if you all need to.</div></blockquote>\n\n<br>\n<br>\nHere's VCA for you TB", "time": "Tue Feb 21, 2017 6:36 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=70230&start=2400", "forum": "53", "thread": "70230"}

She has been labelled by Guinness World Records as the most prolific female murderer, though the precise number of her victims is debated. B&#225;thory and four collaborators were accused of torturing and killing hundreds of young women between 1585 and 1609. The stories of her serial murders and brutality are verified by the testimony of more than 300 witnesses and survivors as well as physical evidence and the presence of horribly mutilated dead, dying and imprisoned girls found at the time of her arrest. Stories which ascribe to her vampire-like tendencies (most famously the tale that she bathed in the blood of virgins to retain her youth) were generally recorded years after her death and are considered unreliable. Her story quickly became part of national folklore, and her infamy persists to this day, with B&#225;thory known popularly as 'The Blood Countess'.</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-6]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Grendel - </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-6]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">ThinkBig - </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-6]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Rautherdir - </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-4]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Lil Uzi Vert - RadiantCowbells, ThinkBig </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-6]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">nancy - </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-3]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Cooperative Sheep - Grendel, mattblackguy, Fro99er  </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-6]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Keyser S&#246;ze - </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-6]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Fro99er -  </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-4]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">mattblackguy - Lil Uzi Vert, Keyser S&#246;ze </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-6]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">RadiantCowbells - </div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-5]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">No Lynch - Rautherdir</div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"font-size: 125%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Waiting for their DOOM</div></div> - Cooperative Sheep, nancy  <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\"><div style=\"font-size: 100%; line-height: normal; display: inline\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Day 3 ends in <span class=\"countdown\">(expired on 2017-03-01 19:45:00)</span></div></div></div></fieldset>", "time": "Tue Feb 21, 2017 10:53 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=70230&start=2500", "forum": "53", "thread": "70230"}

She was presumed to have infected 51 people, three of whom died, over the course of her career as a cook. However, as she used many aliases to evade the authorities and worked for many employers for only a short term, the number is likely far higher, including as many as an estimated fifty fatalities.<br>\n<br>\nWhile Mallon was not a cold-blooded murderess, her recklessness and felonious irresponsibility makes her no less a killer. Mallon was adamant throughout her life that, despite the omnipresence of typhoid fever around her, she was perfectly healthy and could not be the cause. She rejected the medical science, and denied the utility of handwashing and other precautions that would have prevented her from spreading the disease. After refusing to cooperate with physicians, she was legally compelled to not work as a cook. After only a brief period of compliance, Mallon adopted a pseudonym and returned to work, infecting more people. Ultimately, Typhoid Mary was confined to a quarantine hospital on an island in New York's East River until her death.</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-6]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Grendel - </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-6]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">ThinkBig - </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-5]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Rautherdir - RadiantCowbells </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-4]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Lil Uzi Vert - mattblackguy, Grendel </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-6]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">nancy - </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-6]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Cooperative Sheep - </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-6]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Keyser S&#246;ze - </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-6]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Fro99er -  </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-2]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">mattblackguy - Lil Uzi Vert, Keyser S&#246;ze, Fro99er, nancy </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-6]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">RadiantCowbells - </div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-5]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">No Lynch - Rautherdir</div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"font-size: 125%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Waiting for their DOOM</div></div> - Cooperative Sheep, ThinkBig <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\"><div style=\"font-size: 100%; line-height: normal; display: inline\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Day 3 ends in <span class=\"countdown\">(expired on 2017-03-01 19:45:00)</span></div></div></div></fieldset>", "time": "Wed Feb 22, 2017 11:47 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=70230&start=2675", "forum": "53", "thread": "70230"}

Now I know you didn't care about any of my answers, which is why I didn't care about answering them in the first place, but just so you don't get continue to be cranky I answered them for you. I want to see if anyone is reading my posts. If you read this far say cheese in your next post. Here I'll give you some good questions.<br>\n<br>\n(1) If you think I'm scum then who do you think my partner is? You already said you don't think Akarin(ThinkBig), and Sheep are scum. Then who else is there?<br>\n(2) Since you think I'm scum and want to lynch me you must be pretty sure that scum attacked RC, and that I wasn't the reason for the No Kill. Why do you think scum would attack RC when he already claimed Bulletproof. They can't kill him so what was the purpose of that? It makes 0 sense to me that people actually think this was the most probable reason for the No Kill. Seriously me jailing Rauth, and either protecting Rauth from the kill or preventing Rauth from making the kill makes a lot more sense. But it seems it's easier for people to ignore the facts and just say I'm scum.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nI'm not sure about Nancy tbh, but I still don't think JarJar's vote on Transcend was a bus/distancing. His vote on Transcend looked a lot more like scum going for an easy mislynch. Why would Jar bus Transcend at that point in time when there wasn't good reason for him to be lynched? Most of the case against him was policy, and that people didn't like his vague reads. That's not really AI for Transcend afaik.<br>\n<br>\nI'm not even sure about Rauth anymore. It's so odd for scum!rauth to claim backup cop, and clear the person his partner is tunneling on that I thought it was unlikely that he would flip scum. I basically cleared him as town for just that, but his play so far day 3 isn't good at all. He hasn't really done anything. Honestly Rauth might know that both I, and LUV are both PRs which is why he doesn't want to take a stance here. The fact that he said earlier that he thinks that both me and LUV can both flip town is really shady.  @Rauth, There's almost certainly one scum in the PR claims, and one scum in the VT claims. Which do you think is more likely to be scum, and more likely to be town in each pool.<br>\n<br>\nNo matter who we lynch today, I want Rauth to give his stances on the whole playerlist.<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8898442#p8898442\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8898442#p8898442\" data-post-id=\"8898442\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 2532</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=25634\">Fro99er</a> wrote:</cite><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: mbg</span><br>\n<br>\nif this is scum then we win.

Scum definitely would benefit a lot from me being lynched with how strong my role is right now. If I can stop one more kill it will buy us an extra mislynch which scum definitely don't want.<br>\n(2) Idk, but no lynching is definitely better than mislynching me today. Lynching in VT is preferable to both though. If we can nail the scum in VT then we basically win the game, but if we don't it still narrows down the game a lot if we lynch the right person. There's a good chance we can sort out the PR claims tomorrow depending on the night actions. <br>\n(3) No...<br>\n(4) I'm not going to lie about who I jailed night 1. I knew saying I jailed you night 1 would make people more suspicious of me, but it's what I did. I'm not going to start lying and say I jailed someone else when I didn't. If I was scum lying about my role don't you think it makes more sense for me to lie and say I jailed Grendel? I townread Grendel for mostly the entirety of the game, and no one would be suspicious of me choosing Grendel.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF0000\">Hmm, yes, WIFOM says scum-you would have just picked your strongest t/read and not me. However, my confusion (or suspicion) is the TIMING of when you started to scum read me. Was it at the start of D2, during your re-read during D1, during a re-read of my ISO D2? It looked to me like you came into D2 scum reading me, so saying you jailed me for being strong-townie was a contradiction. I suspected this contradiction was a SCUM-SLIP. You still need to put down in writing the timescale of your changing read of me.</div></div><br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8908120#p8908120\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8908120#p8908120\" data-post-id=\"8908120\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 2854</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=25845\">Keyser S&#246;ze</a> wrote:</cite>Please can you explain to me why Rauth's roleclaim meant Grendel, Nancy and Akarin were town?<br>\n<br>\n...and the 3 scum HAD to be in the bottom list of 5 players.</div></blockquote>\nI was townreading those 3 independent of Rauth. I didn't say they HAD to be in the bottom list. Everything I say is my opinion. Stop reading everything I say like I'm trying to pass off everything as facts, because I'm not. Those bottom were the list of people I wasn't townreading. Now I know you didn't care about any of my answers, which is why I didn't care about answering them in the first place, but just so you don't get continue to be cranky I answered them for you. I want to see if anyone is reading my posts. If you read this far say cheese in your next post. Here I'll give you some good questions.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF0000\">Cheese.</div></div><br>\n<br>\n(1) If you think I'm scum then who do you think my partner is? You already said you don't think Akarin(ThinkBig), and Sheep are scum. Then who else is there?<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF0000\">I'd prefer to take on one player at a time via their associations with JarJar. I had you and LUV as the prime candidates going into D3. Since then, other players have presented scum-cases via Sheep and ThingBig via your scum-flip. Thus, you can understand how your flip would provide some information. Other players, have ruled out 5 town PR's - thus, many people (including me) don't think ALL the PR's can be town (MGB, Rauth, RC, LUV)</div></div><br>\n<br>\n(2) Since you think I'm scum and want to lynch me you must be pretty sure that scum attacked RC, and that I wasn't the reason for the No Kill. Why do you think scum would attack RC when he already claimed Bulletproof. They can't kill him so what was the purpose of that? It makes 0 sense to me that people actually think this was the most probable reason for the No Kill. Seriously me jailing Rauth, and either protecting Rauth from the kill or preventing Rauth from making the kill makes a lot more sense. But it seems it's easier for people to ignore the facts and just say I'm scum.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF0000\">They could have WIFOM'd themselves out of thinking RC was being truthful. Scum may have thought RC was 1-shot bulletproof. That is the main reason for going for a NO LYNCH/not lynching you today though: your supposed jailing of Rauth explains the no NK - Rauth was the obvious night target for scum.</div></div></div></blockquote>", "time": "Sun Feb 26, 2017 10:58 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=70230&start=2900", "forum": "53", "thread": "70230"}

After serving under Benjamin Hornigold, Teach captured a French merchant vessel, renamed her Queen Anne's Revenge, and equipped her with 40 guns. He became a renowned pirate, his cognomen derived from his thick black beard and fearsome appearance; he was reported to have tied lit fuses under his hat to frighten his enemies. He formed an alliance of pirates and blockaded the port of Charles Town, South Carolina. He accepted a royal pardon and retired before returning to the sea, after which he was hunted down by the government of Virginia and hanged.</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-6]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Grendel - nancy, </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-6]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">ThinkBig - </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-6]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Rautherdir - </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-6]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Lil Uzi Vert - </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-6]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">nancy - </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-5]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Cooperative Sheep - Grendel </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-6]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Keyser S&#246;ze - </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-5]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Fro99er - mattblackguy  </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-2]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">mattblackguy - Lil Uzi Vert, Cooperative Sheep, Fro99er, RadiantCowbells </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-6]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">RadiantCowbells - </div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-5]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">No Lynch - Rautherdir</div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"font-size: 125%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Waiting for their DOOM</div></div> - ThinkBig, Keyser S&#246;ze <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\"><div style=\"font-size: 100%; line-height: normal; display: inline\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Day 3 ends in <span class=\"countdown\">(expired on 2017-03-01 19:45:00)</span></div></div></div></fieldset>", "time": "Mon Feb 27, 2017 5:00 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=70230&start=2975", "forum": "53", "thread": "70230"}

You have a few caveats in your game that other players don't have and your fundamentals are good. Your scumgame is better than your towngame because when you're scum you're pulling all the strings. When you're Town you have to actually gain the confidence of others and you can't let them in to what you're doing behind the scenes, which is where the most interesting and meaningful parts of your play are. Reading games is the only way I have to learn outside of my games and as a newbie my newbie games weren't enough.

Because LUV is the counterwagon, it is very unlikely that LUV is scum. This leaves {Akarin, Grendel, Fro99er}.<br>\n<br>\nSince I have {Grendel, LUV} as the scumspects on the gerryoat wagon and LUV is counterwagon to JJD, we can provisionally rule LUV out. Which leaves Grendel.<br>\n<br>\nTo return to the original hypothesis, if 1 of {Grendel, Keyser, mbg, Sheep} should be scum and 1 of {Akarin, Rauthedir} should be scum, then Grendel is scum and Rautherdir is scum.<br>\n<br>\nIf you are keen to vote in PRs, vote Rautherdir. If you are keen to vote in VTs, vote Grendel.

Capone started small, but expanded his bootlegging business through increasingly violent means. His mutually profitable relationships with mayor William Hale Thompson and the city's police meant that Capone seemed safe from law enforcement. However, the Saint Valentine's Day Massacre of gang rivals, resulting in the killing of seven men in broad daylight, damaged Chicago's image&#8212;as well as Capone's&#8212;leading influential citizens to demand governmental action and newspapers to dub him \"Public Enemy No. 1\". The federal authorities became intent on jailing Capone, and they prosecuted him for tax evasion in 1931, a federal crime and a novel strategy during the era.

Possibly the worst serial killer in Australian history, Lynch was a bushranger who murdered and robbed cattle herders and laborers in the trails around Berima. Lynch's murder spree started after he went to the farm of T.B. Humphrey, where he had previously worked, and stole eight cattle before setting out for Sydney, where his intention was to sell them. At Razorback Mountain, he met a man called Ireland along with an Aboriginal boy who were driving a full cattle herd loaded with wheat, bacon and other produce. The cargo was meant to be delivered to Thomas Cowper, who was a stranger to Lynch, and decided it would be more profitable to take Ireland&#8217;s load and sell it rather than his initial intention. Early one morning, Ireland asked the boy to help round up the cattle, and once they were away from the camp Lynch crept up behind him and smashed the back of his head with a tomahawk, killing him. Returning to camp while Ireland was making breakfast, Lynch distracted him before crashing the tomahawk into the back of his head, killing him too. Lynch hid both corpses and continued to Sydney to execute his plan with his stolen merchandise. On his way back from Sydney, close to Razorback Mountain, he met a father and son called Frazer, who were driving a cattle herd owned by a Mr Bawten. Lynch fancied this herd and decided he would have to kill the Frazers to get it, accompanying them on their journey. That night, they camped near Cordeaux Flat, and the next morning Lynch killed both men and then buried their bodies. After killing the Frazers, Lynch decided to deal with the Mulligans, who had owed him &#163;30 for stolen goods they had purchased off him. He visited the Mulligan farm and killed the four members of the family before gathering the bodies, built a pyre and set them alight. Lynch claimed to be the new owner of the property, and he bought it off the surviving Mulligans as the family left town without a word to anybody. Lynch was eventually found guilty of the murder of a man named Kearns Landregan, and hanged.</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-6]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Grendel - </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-6]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">ThinkBig - </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF0000\"><div style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: normal; display: inline\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[LYNCH ACHIEVED]</div></div> <div style=\"font-size: 110%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Rautherdir - mattblackguy, nancy, Grendel, TheRealGin-N-Tonic, Fro99er, Rautherdir</div></div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-6]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">TheRealGin-N-Tonic - </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-6]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">nancy - </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-6]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Cooperative Sheep - </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-6]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Keyser S&#246;ze - </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-6]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Fro99er - </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-5]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">mattblackguy - Cooperative Sheep </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-6]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">RadiantCowbells - </div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"font-size: 125%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Waiting for their DOOM</div></div> - ThinkBig, Keyser S&#246;ze,  RadiantCowbells<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\"><div style=\"font-size: 100%; line-height: normal; display: inline\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Day 3 ends NOW</div></div></div></fieldset>", "time": "Thu Mar 02, 2017 10:27 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=70230&start=3475", "forum": "53", "thread": "70230"}

English use of longbows was effective against the French during the Hundred Years' War, particularly at the start of the war in the battles of Sluys (1340), Cr&#233;cy (1346), and Poitiers (1356), and perhaps most famously at the Battle of Agincourt (1415). At Agincourt, it is said that the cream of the French nobility was destroyed, with thousands of knights slaughtered by well-trained commoners wielding these bows, which were effective at incredible range and could punch through even heavy plate. This marked the beginning of the end of specialized and expensive heavy cavalry requiring a noble income, and the beginning of the dominance of trained, professional soldiery.</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-5]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Grendel - </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-5]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">ThinkBig - </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-5]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">TheRealGin-N-Tonic - </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-5]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">nancy - </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-5]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Cooperative Sheep - </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-5]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Fro99er - </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-5]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">mattblackguy -  </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-5]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">RadiantCowbells - </div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"font-size: 125%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Waiting for their DOOM</div></div> - Grendel, ThinkBig, TheRealGin-N-Tonic, nancy, Cooperative Sheep, Fro99er, mattblackguy, RadiantCowbells<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\"><div style=\"font-size: 100%; line-height: normal; display: inline\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Day 4 ends in <span class=\"countdown\">(expired on 2017-03-19 14:00:00)</span></div></div></div></fieldset>", "time": "Sun Mar 05, 2017 8:07 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=70230&start=3475", "forum": "53", "thread": "70230"}

Unlike many similar weapons, the pike is not intended to be thrown. Pikes were used regularly in European warfare from the early Middle Ages until around 1700, and were wielded by foot soldiers deployed in close quarters. The pike found extensive use with Landsknecht armies and Swiss mercenaries, who employed it as their main weapon and used it in pike square formations. Where the longbow ended the dominance of knights as the masters of the battlefield, extensive use of pikeman tactics removed the dominance of cavalry entirely until the incorporation of firearms into mounted combat. A disciplined wall of pikemen wielding razor-tipped death on the end of twenty-foot poles would break any charge.</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-5]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Grendel - </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-5]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">ThinkBig - </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-1]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">TheRealGin-N-Tonic - ThinkBig, RadiantCowbells, nancy, Cooperative Sheep</div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-5]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">nancy - </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-5]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Cooperative Sheep - </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-5]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Fro99er - </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-5]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">mattblackguy -  </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-5]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">RadiantCowbells - </div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"font-size: 125%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Waiting for their DOOM</div></div> - Grendel, TheRealGin-N-Tonic,  Fro99er, mattblackguy <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\"><div style=\"font-size: 100%; line-height: normal; display: inline\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Day 4 ends in <span class=\"countdown\">(expired on 2017-03-19 14:00:00)</span></div></div></div></fieldset>", "time": "Sun Mar 05, 2017 8:08 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=70230&start=3600", "forum": "53", "thread": "70230"}

They were primarily used to demoralize, injure, and kill entrenched defenders, against whom the indiscriminate and generally very slow-moving or static nature of gas clouds would be most effective. The types of weapons employed ranged from disabling chemicals, such as tear gas, to lethal agents like phosgene, chlorine, and mustard gas. Gas was unlike most other weapons of the period because it was possible to develop effective countermeasures, such as gas masks. In the later stages of the war, as the use of gas increased, its overall effectiveness diminished. The use of gas was emblematic of the way World War I was fought, and why it was so different from all other wars that had been fought to that point. Trench warfare was inhuman, completely impersonal. Gone were the times when the order of the day was one man killing another, now monstrous weapons of science would indiscriminately slaughter hundreds of thousands in a single battle, without ever seeing the faces of those they were killing.</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-5]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Grendel - </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-5]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">ThinkBig - </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-1]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">TheRealGin-N-Tonic - RadiantCowbells, Cooperative Sheep, ThinkBig, mattblackguy</div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-5]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">nancy - </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-5]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Cooperative Sheep - </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-5]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Fro99er - </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-5]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">mattblackguy -  </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-4]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">RadiantCowbells - TheRealGin-N-Tonic</div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"font-size: 125%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Waiting for their DOOM</div></div> - Grendel, Fro99er, nancy<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\"><div style=\"font-size: 100%; line-height: normal; display: inline\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Day 4 ends in <span class=\"countdown\">(expired on 2017-03-19 14:00:00)</span></div></div></div></fieldset>", "time": "Mon Mar 06, 2017 7:40 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=70230&start=3775", "forum": "53", "thread": "70230"}

Atomic bombs are sufficient to devastate entire cities, killing tens or hundreds of thousands in mere minutes, and release many kinds of radiation and electromagnetic pulses. Only two nuclear devices have been deployed in anger, both by the United States against Japan at the end of World War II, driving the Japanese to surrender. The advent of the atomic era presaged an entirely new kind of warfare, where the potential consequences of all-out war between nations so armed became unthinkable, and belligerents took to fighting a cold war of small-scale conflict and the sponsoring of proxy agents, as well as economic and diplomatic antagonism.<br>\n<br>\nWhile nuclear war on any scale has never broken out, it remains a specter of doom haunting the descendants of Einstein and Oppenheimer.</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-5]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Grendel - </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-5]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">ThinkBig - </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF0000\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">[LYNCH ACHIEVED]</div></div> <div style=\"font-size: 110%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">TheRealGin-N-Tonic - RadiantCowbells, Cooperative Sheep, ThinkBig, mattblackguy, nancy</div></div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-5]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">nancy - </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-5]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Cooperative Sheep - </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-5]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Fro99er - </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-5]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">mattblackguy -  </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-4]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">RadiantCowbells - TheRealGin-N-Tonic</div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"font-size: 125%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Waiting for their DOOM</div></div> - Grendel, Fro99er<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\"><div style=\"font-size: 100%; line-height: normal; display: inline\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Day 4 ends NOW</div></div></div></fieldset>", "time": "Mon Mar 06, 2017 10:21 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=70230&start=3775", "forum": "53", "thread": "70230"}

A weak night light is all that illuminates this next room, concealing what horror lies within. Hands grope in the darkness, until one of you stumbles across a light switch. To your collective surprise, it clicks on, spreading a warm, soft yellow light from several elegant fixtures on the ceiling and sconces on the wall. Blinking, you look around and take a quick head count.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"font-size: 125%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">To your surprise, <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">NO ONE</div> is missing.</div><br>\n<br>\nYou spread out, exploring the small and well-appointed room. Plush leather couches and easy chairs abound, even a small bed with fine Egyptian cotton sheets. A carved oak table braces one wall, set with all manner of food and snacks. Steam rises from a whole honey-baked ham and hot chocolate, and the cookies appear fresh from the oven. Cheese and fruit, wine and soda, bread and beer are laid out, all on a red silk tablecloth. Gilt-framed images of famous massacres and losing battles throughout history are placed evenly around the walls.</div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:darkorange\">Welcome to the Halftime Rest Stop! Nothing in this room will harm you or maim you, stab you or bite you, burn you or mash you. The food isn't poisoned. Really! Eat your fill, rest up a bit, and when you're ready, we can move on.</div></div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">At first, none of you are willing to take the madman at his word and try the food, but nothing else seems to be forthcoming. As the minutes tick by, you all gradually drift toward the table, the gnawing of your empty stomachs becoming too much to bear. Finally, you give in to nibbles and sip, just to test for hazard. When none of you seem in immediate peril of dropping from anything but hunger, everyone falls to and gorges themselves.<br>\n<br>\nSome time later, everyone is sprawled out on the furniture nursing one last drink. One adventurous couple (who shall remain nameless) even rigged up a sheet to provide a modicum of privacy to the small bed in the corner...not that it muffled the sounds of their \"relaxation\" much. As the last crumbs of the cookies are licked lazily off of fingers, a chime rings out. Everyone is shaken from their repose, and the couple in the corner hastily tugs on clothing. Above the great oaken table, a slot opens, and a small golden tray slides out from the wall, bearing a single silvery pill.</div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:darkorange\">Time for your reward, children! I do always like to have at least one survivor, and it's that time, kiddies! The pill on the tray before you is the antidote to the drugs I gave you, but there's only one dose. Choose among yourselves who shall have it, and that lucky individual will be released through the escape hatch cleverly hidden under the table.</div></div>", "time": "Wed Mar 08, 2017 6:00 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=70230&start=3775", "forum": "53", "thread": "70230"}

The incident was heavily propagandized by leading Patriots, such as Paul Revere and Samuel Adams, to fuel animosity toward the British authorities. British troops had been stationed in Boston, capital of the Province of Massachusetts Bay, since 1768 in order to protect and support crown-appointed colonial officials attempting to enforce unpopular Parliamentary legislation. Amid ongoing tense relations between the population and the soldiers, a mob formed around a British sentry, who was subjected to verbal abuse and harassment. He was eventually supported by eight additional soldiers, who were subjected to verbal threats and repeatedly hit by clubs, stones and snowballs. They fired into the crowd, without orders, instantly killing three people and wounding others. Two more people died later of wounds sustained in the incident. The impact of the Boston Massacre is not in the number of people slain in the event, but in the way it resonated with the Patriot cause and fanned the fires of war as an exemplar of British colonial oppression.</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-4]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Grendel - </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-4]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">ThinkBig - </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-4]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">nancy - </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-4]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Cooperative Sheep - </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-4]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Fro99er - </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-4]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">mattblackguy -  </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-4]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">RadiantCowbells - </div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"font-size: 125%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Waiting for their DOOM</div></div> - Grendel, ThinkBig, nancy, Cooperative Sheep, Fro99er, mattblackguy, RadiantCowbells<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\"><div style=\"font-size: 100%; line-height: normal; display: inline\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Day 5 ends in <span class=\"countdown\">(expired on 2017-03-22 23:30:00)</span></div></div></div></fieldset>", "time": "Wed Mar 08, 2017 6:00 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=70230&start=3775", "forum": "53", "thread": "70230"}

When I looked back at their interactions on D1, all I saw was him explaining to Transcend in a sort of condescending tone about why there was a wagon on Grendel and him confirming who he is to Transcend. The latter came off  more snobbish and patronizing then the former. It read like he was projecting a level of importance that he felt he rightfully earned at that point of the game which was very odd. This lead me to believe throughout my reread that there will be various play style and personality clashes between the two and that a lot of what they'll be scum reading each other for will be overblown.<br>\n<br>\nAt the start of D2, he voted Transcend and then I believe states he voted for him because of effort and his suspect voting pattern on D1. Effort is NAI. The second point however is a valid point but if you take a look back on D1, I believe Transcend voted for at least 4-5 different people before voting for Gerry according to my notes. What Sheep fails to acknowledge is that lot of those votes where in RVS and that scum would prefer not to bring that much attention themselves by voting like it's going out of style. <br>\n<br>\nSheep later on questions Transcend about his take on the Gerry and Grendel's wagons but does it in such a way that comes off like he's trying to show others that Transcend is stating his theories as fact. Now I have no idea why Transcend really didn't answer these questions from Sheep but his attitude seemed carefree and just genuine. I think scum would be more alert, more on guard, and try to look as pro-town as possible. Transcend did the exact opposite and while it could've been just an act, I find the simplest explanation always the most probable. <br>\n<br>\nHere we are now and he's pushing nancy over her claiming immediately on replacement and only looking at the vote counts. Which is weird but doesn't make her scum. The latter however is a very bad angle to push in my opinion. Various players on this site put a lot of stock into VCA and nancy may just be one of them. Wouldn't surprise me to be honest since I've heard a lot of good things about her play. He's essentially scum reading her for play style rather than looking for the motivation of her actions.<br>\n<br>\n--<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">@Mod: I'll be v/LA till the 16th.

Following a 13-day siege, Mexican troops under President General Antonio L&#243;pez de Santa Anna launched an assault on the Alamo Mission near San Antonio de B&#233;xar (modern-day San Antonio, Texas, United States), killing all of the Texian defenders. In the early morning hours of March 6, the Mexican Army advanced on the Alamo. After repelling two attacks, the Texians were unable to fend off a third attack. As Mexican soldiers scaled the walls, most of the Texian soldiers withdrew into interior buildings. Defenders unable to reach these points were slain by the Mexican cavalry as they attempted to escape. Between five and seven Texians may have surrendered; if so, they were quickly executed. Most eyewitness accounts reported between 182 and 257 Texians died, while most historians of the Alamo agree that around 600 Mexicans were killed or wounded.  Santa Anna's cruelty during the battle inspired many Texians&#8212;both Texas settlers and adventurers from the United States&#8212;to join the Texian Army. Buoyed by a desire for revenge, the Texians defeated the Mexican Army at the Battle of San Jacinto, on April 21, 1836, ending the revolution. Among the dead defenders were such legendary pioneers as William Travis, Jim Bowie, and Davy Crockett, who legend would have us believed was found surrounded by fallen Mexican soldiers.</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-4]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Grendel - </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF0000\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">[LYNCH ACHIEVED]</div></div> <div style=\"font-size: 110%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">ThinkBig - RadiantCowbells, mattblackguy, nancy, Fro99er</div></div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-4]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">nancy - </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-4]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Cooperative Sheep - ThinkBig</div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-4]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Fro99er - </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-4]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">mattblackguy -  </div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">[L-4]</div> <div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">RadiantCowbells - </div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"font-size: 125%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Waiting for their DOOM</div></div> - Grendel, Cooperative Sheep<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\"><div style=\"font-size: 100%; line-height: normal; display: inline\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Day 5 ends NOW!</div></div></div></fieldset>", "time": "Thu Mar 09, 2017 2:26 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=70230&start=4075", "forum": "53", "thread": "70230"}

It seems that a moment of safety and respite had the opposite of the intended effect; instead of heightening their impending doom with false hope, Pine's momentary reprieve galvanizes the survivors with genuine hope. Anger sweeps through the group, as they unify behind rejecting the game and resolving to escape together. Their rage and angst is focused on ThinkBig, as he seems to be more focused on his personal safety than on helping the group escape.<br>\n<br>\n\"Alright, fine!\" shouts RadiantCowbells, \"You want the medicine? You want to save yourself over us? That can be arranged!\" As mattblackguy holds the struggling ThinkBig against the wall, RadiantCowbells grabs the silvery antidote. Fro99er pries open ThinkBig's mouth, and RadiantCowbells rams the pill down his throat, gashing his knuckles on ThinkBig's broken teeth. nancy holds the victim's shattered mouth closed and pinches his nostrils together until ThinkBig swallows the pill, along with several ounces of blood and the remains of his smile.<br>\n<br>\nWhile ThinkBig groans in pain and gags on his own blood, the rest of you proceed to trash the lovely Halftime room.

Even the nice new wallpaper is torn down from the walls of the old basement storeroom. Finally, the group turns its sights on the purported escape hatch. The fine oak table is upended, revealing a tunnel entrance.
