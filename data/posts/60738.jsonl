He then unvoted Llama (050) only to vote him again later (076) and sarcastically push to lynch again (084).  <br>\n<br>\n\"The Cogito List Case\"<br>\nCogito was not an active player apparently, and the scum would have NK'd someone they knew, thus scum ought to be someone who played with Cogito (017), and that list is: CBD, GIF, Llama, Tripod.  I've removed Equinox from this list because he posted the list.  GIF doubted the list (018).<br>\n<br>\nI really like everything Derangement and Bubs have posted.  They are being useful to the town, and helping us get good reads on them.  This is Pro-town and should be encouraged.  I really don't like Tripod's playstyle, and i believe he is hurting the town with his antics.  This should be discouraged.<br>\n<br>\nSo for a second, let us think that Tripod is just a really bad towny.  There he is drawing the spotlight, getting all the suspicions and all that.  Scum would gravitate to this and try to get on board.  Llama saw this right when it happened and FOS'd Tripod (047, 072) and then hopped on when it got rolling (100).  Bubs is also on Tripod (062) and stated his suspicions based on Tripod's vote against Llama.  <br>\n<br>\nSidenote:  Bubs voted Prawn (026) because he voted Llama, and he voted Tripod (062) because he voted Llama.  &gt;_&gt;<br>\n<br>\nSo i guess i'd like to hear more from Llama, because he's got some cases against him, and we can use his alignment to help us understand Tripod.

In fact, given that we are playing in a rare night-start game, I'm surprised that people both expected and promoted random votes. For the record, I never make a \"random\" vote if there is any better premise on which to base a vote because random votes are the least likely thing to achieve anything pro-town.<br>\n<br>\na) Choosing arbitrarily from a deliberately selected subset of players is arbitrary in one sense but not the important one (I chose the subset); your arguing this point seems to be more for argument's sake than for actually believing it to be indicative of scumminess on my part.<br>\n<br>\nb) I saw no reason to spoon-feed. I thought \"BOOOOOOOOO\" would make clear my feelings on the nightkill and eagle-eyed players might spot a correlation with my subsequent vote.

Equinox did a pro-town thing posting the list, and we all know that equinox was on it, and its even named after him.  I removed him from the list because i feel like if he were scum he'd either not have posted it, or removed himself from it, or defended himself from his own list in his post.  he did none of these things, he's probably not the 1 scum on the list.<br>\n<br>\nI think bubs plays pretty pro-town.  he's useful to keep around, and his straight forward playstyle would make him easier to catch if he were scum.  We ought not lynch him under current situations because he's helping the town regardless of alignment.  He's also mildly town.<br>\n<br>\nEquinox 173 (paraphrased)<br>\n\"Why are Tripod and Llama different alignments?\"<br>\n\"What about the Cogito List Case?\"<br>\n\"Why is Bub's fishy?\"<br>\n\"the other one\"<br>\n<br>\nIf both Tripod and Llama were scum, tripod placing him at L-1 would have been safe because they know no scum would derphammer it.  If a townie derphammered it, they'd lynch the townie next day and trade 1 for 1, which is a losing tactic for scum.  It wouldn't even produce towncred for Tripod, it'd be just useless.  So they are probably not both scum.<br>\n<br>\nIf both were town, then the scum are just loving this, and at least one would totally be on the wagon.<br>\n<br>\nSidenote: The Llamawagon was CBD(004), Telltale(016), Equinox(017), Prawn(025), Tripod(034).<br>\n <br>\nThe suspicious slots on the Llamawagon are held by CBD, Telltale and Equinox.  I think Equinox is townish, but the other two are entirely reasonable possible-scum.  I got some things to say about CBD in any case (see below).<br>\n<br>\nThe Cogito List Case will very probably remain interesting until at least 1 person on it dies.  I really like the way Equinox laid it out for us, and there really probably is a scum to be found there.  We shouldn't just start at the top and lynch downward, but anyone on the list is suspicious because they are on the list.<br>\n<br>\nBubs is fishy but not very scummy.  I love vote patterns and vote analysis, and finding that little tidbit was pretty fun.  I don't know if it means anything, but if llama flipped scum and prawn or tripod flip town, or if llama flips powerrole, it might add meaning to this thing.<br>\n<br>\nok and now the other one... its um \"What do you think of the people who have voiced disagreement with the case against LlamaFluff?&#8221;<br>\n<br>\nI'm a little shaky on what the case against Llama actually is.  I know what my case against him is, but nobody's else has really made it plain why they were voting for him.  CBD and Telltale's votes were RVS, Equinox gave meta+bad math reasons which better damn well be tongue in cheek or he should go back and take high school statistics again.  Prawn provided no reasons what so ever, and Tripod has stated plenty that it's a pressure vote or a lolvote depending on how anti-town he feels at the moment.<br>\n<br>\nMy case against Llama is that 1, his process of vote GIF, FOS Tripod (047), GIF says good things about Llama (079, 080), then Llama moves his vote to Tripod, whom he FOS'd (100) seems rather planned out.  Its just got an evil scum plan vibe to it.  And 2, he's on the Cogito List.<br>\n<br>\nSo the question is what do i think about the people who have voiced disagreements with this?  I'm having a bit of a hard time figuring out who you are referring to.  Nobody has obviously defended llama.  Tripod 55 likes his idgaf attitude, which Tripod would like, because he's anti-town, and thus a poor defense.  GIF praises Llama's bias in 79 and 80, but that doesn't have anything to do with the cases either.  <br>\n<br>\nSo yeah, you're gonna have to help me answer your question by pointing out who disagreed with the case.  sorry.<br>\n<br>\nIn 166, CBD says \"You(TellTale) should tell us your reads on everyone.\" and yeah no you shouldn't.  Lists of reads are great fuel for scum and not all that helpful for town.  Its great to be like 'top 2 bottom 2' and all that, because its important that we know what you're up to, but complete lists are pretty much 'NK people in this order' lists, which isn't something i want the scum to know.  Plus they provide plenty of un-useful nitpicking about why mildly-scummy person A is above mildly-scummy person B, instead of discussing whoever's actually at the top or bottom.  Lists are bad.  bad bad lists.<br>\n<br>\nAlso in 142, CBD is like ima just hop on this wagon if you don't mind for no reason.  right in the good ol suspicious #3 seat.  He was on the Llamawagon as well, granted in a less suspicious seat.

Therefore there is at least one town-aligned player who has this idea in their heads that they don't need to explain their votes when they make them, only when it's demanded.<br>\n<br>\nOK, I can buy that the amount of votes needed to put pressure on someone is L-2 rather than the 3 I thought it was in the beginning. It's difficult but I can buy that Untrod Tripod is just a naturally reckless player and that the act of placing a L-1 vote on LlamaFluff is not a scum-motivated move.<br>\n<br>\nBut this?<br>\n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/qOixygj.gif\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"><br>\n(whatiswrongwithyoupeople.gif - yay, I did a Homestar Runner gif and my name is a Homestar Runner reference!)<br>\n<br>\nWhere did you get this idea from? Why do you not feel the need to justify your votes when you make them? Votes are things that cause people to become out of the game, we need to make sure it's the right people who are becoming out of the game, we achieve this by observing, thinking and sharing our observations and thoughts, and you think it's perfectly fine townie behaviour to cast votes without stating your rationale for them? Since when does the town benefit from you hiding the reasoning behind your actions?<br>\n<br>\nNo no no no no, town benefits from information being in the open. There <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">is</div> good reason to hide the contents of role PMs since we don't want scum knowing where the power roles are (or where they aren't), but apart from that, sharing information means we can get different perspectives from each other that we might not have thought of on our own. It's the old adage of two heads being better than one, but amplified to however many townies are in this game. By placing a vote without explaining it, you are withholding useful information that can improve the accuracy of our reads and increase our chances of lynching scum (and, by extension, winning).<br>\n<br>\nIt's a good thing then that some folks have been prodding people for the explanations for their unexplained votes, otherwise scum would have an incredibly easy game and we'd be more fucked than 15 prostitutes by the end of their shift!<br>\n<br>\nWhile the rationales behind my votes were couched in questions, demands and sarcasm when I made them, at least they were there. LlamaFluff was even better about it with <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6600966#p6600966\">his</a> <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6604640#p6604640\">votes</a> in that he explicitly stated why he voted for someone in the posts that he did. Say what you will about the quality of his reasoning, but at least it was there. Only his lack of explanation for why he would also have voted Untrod Tripod in his first post was a problem in that regard.<br>\n<br>\nWhy do so many of you find it so hard to be so explicit about your reasoning before someone prods you into giving the reasoning? Why does explicitly giving your reasoning with your vote not come naturally to you? Apart from the contents of your role PM, what could those of you who are townies possibly have to hide?</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\nFurther thoughts will come when I'm calmer.", "time": "Wed Feb 18, 2015 12:08 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=60738&start=200", "forum": "53", "thread": "60738"}

I think that most people don't look up the posts i'm talking about very often, and so hotlinking them might very well be a waste of time.  we'll see.<br>\n<br>\nYou and Derangement post posts that are rich in information.  You respond directly to questions and seem to express yourselves in a method i find easy to understand, unlike llama who i can't seem to understand what he means when he types stuff.  Providing the town with easy to use information is pro-town.  It helps the town catch scum even if its the scum who are being pro-town.  yall probably already know all this being veteran players and all but<br>\n<br>\nPro-town actions are ones that make the actor easier to catch if they are scum.  They involve expressing your suspicious and showing how they evolve over time, and what evidence convinced you to change your mind.  They also involve avoiding things that are mathematically bad for the town such as voting during MyLo and stuff like that.<br>\n<br>\nAnti-town actions are the other ones.  Things that confuse everyone, make it harder to scumhunt, and make you harder to catch if you are scum.  Stuff like lurking.  Many policy lynches are designed to discourage anti-town play and force the scum to be pro-town and easier to catch.  I'm not sure that policy lynches actually do that, but its probably their intention.  <br>\n<br>\nNote that pro-town doesn't mean town and anti-town doesn't mean scum, it is just a method of defining how a player plays.  Tripod plays anti-town and everything might get fucked up because of him, but he might be town and we probably shouldn't policy lynch him for his antics because at least he's active.  What i'm trying to say is anti-towns aren't always scum.  they are just harder to catch when they are scum, and so should be beaten with a giant stick until they behave. <br>\n<br>\nI agree with Derangement's 133 post.  It is entirely possible that some people have town and scum tells that come out over multiple games, and that it might be possible to use them to your advantage in a current game.  However, the more they are used the less likely they are to keep working.  Its probably bad practice to rely on them too heavily, but hey a clue is a clue.<br>\n<br>\nAlso, yes please everyone, explain your votes in the post that contains the vote.  its pro-town, pyo.<br>\n<br>\nPS AND HAY YOU GIF EXPLAIN YOUR UNVOTE RIGHT NOW YOUNG MAN.  geez do you even read the thread?", "time": "Wed Feb 18, 2015 12:55 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=60738&start=200", "forum": "53", "thread": "60738"}

You are talking about an apparent bias in his posts that flavors town as 'smart' and scum as 'dumb', and use this as a reason to town-read him.  Can you provide evidence proving this bias existed?  i'm not seeing anything like it in the Llamaquote you provided.  so thus we return to the question at hand, unanswered.<br>\n<br>\nGIF, WHY DO YOU THINK LLAMA IS TOWN?  please don't link me to your previous posts because they have proven to be useless and devoid of content.  please instead write a paragraph or two about it right here right now, possibly with post numbers supporting your theory.  build a case, show us why it is you believe what you believe.<br>\n<br>\n-=-<br>\n<br>\nLurkers annoy me greatly.  day 1's are a great time to lynch all lurkers because it improves the rest of the game, and there's no information day 1 anyway, so they are just as likely to be scum as anyone else.  I'm not sure our N0 start changes this.  please don't lurk.<br>\n<br>\nAs town, it is to our benefit to force an environment in which all players act pro-town.  Pro-town players express their ideas and post them in easy to use formats.  They show how their suspicions change slowly over time and what changed their suspicions.  They vote for people these suspicions point at.  This is a healthy way to play as town, and so town should want to do it anyway.  Scum don't want to play this way, because it limits their ability to get away with bullshit.  By forcing them to play pro-town, it makes it easier to recognize their bullshit, and thus easier to catch.  <br>\n<br>\nI've been in enough games to know that there are just some idiot anti-town losers out there who choose to play anti-town regardless of alignment and continuously fuck the town over because they are idiots.  We can't really get rid of them, and they are too dumb to learn to play better, and lynching them is only a short term solution because they'll just show up in the next game.  Scummy actions are a subset of anti-town actions.  Idiots who happen to be town and play anti-town perform, at least in hindsight, non-scummy anti-town actions.  it is often hard to tell the difference though.  <br>\n<br>\nI'm not at all convinced that Tripod is just really terrible town and not scum, but i feel that lynching Llama would give us more information about Tripod than lynching Tripod would give us information on Llama.  Llamascum would go a long way towards town-reading Tripod, at which point i'd be happy to minimize his harmful effects by ignoring him.  it would prove him terrible but harmless, which is a big improvement.  <br>\n<br>\nLlamatown would cast even more suspicion than we already have on Tripod, and i could easily see me voting for him the next day because of it.  it would show that he really is both idiotic and dangerous, having L-1'd a townie with a possible power role on page 2.  <br>\n<br>\nIt also happens that Llama is pretty damn scummy.  He keeps making these asserations that he's answered questions when he really hasn't.

Pro-town players express their ideas and post them in easy to use formats.  They show how their suspicions change slowly over time and what changed their suspicions.  They vote for people these suspicions point at.  This is a healthy way to play as town, and so town should want to do it anyway.  Scum don't want to play this way, because it limits their ability to get away with bullshit.  By forcing them to play pro-town, it makes it easier to recognize their bullshit, and thus easier to catch.  <br>\n<br>\nI've been in enough games to know that there are just some idiot anti-town losers out there who choose to play anti-town regardless of alignment and continuously fuck the town over because they are idiots.  We can't really get rid of them, and they are too dumb to learn to play better, and lynching them is only a short term solution because they'll just show up in the next game.

Without planning it, it is unlikely that scum would L-1 scum.  or to put it in logical symbolism:<br>\n<br>\n1) <div style=\"display:inline;color:darkred\">(A) Scum!Llama</div> --&gt; <div style=\"display:inline;color:green\">(D) Town!Tripod</div><br>\n<br>\n--&gt; is 'implies'.

That might very well tip the scales from Anti-town to you-dirty-scum.  it would be a stronger argument than anything we have right now, but there might exist other strong arguments by the time we get this one, so we'll just have to deal with it again when it comes up tomorrow.  <br>\n<br>\nYa know, i'm going to use length of implication arrow to represent degree of certainty.  a longer arrow is more likely than a shorter arrow.<br>\n<br>\n----&gt; i'll eat my keyboard if this isn't true<br>\n---&gt; very probably true<br>\n--&gt; probably true<br>\n-&gt; mebbe...<br>\n<br>\nso those are:<br>\n<br>\n1) <div style=\"display:inline;color:darkred\">(A) Scum!Llama</div> ---&gt; <div style=\"display:inline;color:green\">(D) Town!Tripod</div><br>\n2) <div style=\"display:inline;color:green\">(B) Town!Llama</div> --&gt; <div style=\"display:inline;color:darkred\">(C) Scum!Tripod</div><br>\n<br>\ncould either of these fuck up?  sure.  it is remotely possible that tripod L-1'd his scumbuddy on page 2, but yeah it seems pretty damn unlikely.  its only a degree of certainty after all.<br>\n<br>\nNow we will explore lynching Tripod first, which is not something i recommend.<br>\n<br>\n3) <div style=\"display:inline;color:darkred\">(C) Scum!Tripod</div> ---&gt; <div style=\"display:inline;color:green\">(B) Town!Llama</div><br>\n<br>\nfor the exact same reasons as used in conditional 1.

I don't know how else to describe it, but onion's posts are filled with this kind of tone.<br>\n<br>\nIn other news:<br>\n<br>\nThere's a solid block of you who have brought \"obvtown\" to new levels. Keep on rockin'.<br>\n<br>\nThis game has a quirk where there's a whole bunch of players who believe that town should be transparent, and then there's the whole other bunch who don't quite believe that. Derangement said something like this earlier, but one person's \"pro-town\" is another's \"anti-town\" and yet another's \"scummy\"; if you looked at onion using only behavioral tells, for instance, suggesting a chain lynch, even if unidirectional, is scummy, but onion is anything but scummy. This quirk may become an issue later on. Keep this mind when that \"later on\" happens.<br>\n<br>\nThat said, I'm also in a place where I don't have too many non-town reads, which might become hilariously embarrassing if I turn out to be wrong.

Tripod is anti-town and dangerous and crazy, while Llama blends into the background, chooses to disregard questions asked of him, and places only votes that are popular.  either one could easily be scum.  Also, they are both on the Cogito List, so there's that as well.  Because both are pretty scummy, we should probably lynch at least one of em some time, and as of right now, the information provided by a Llama lynch is equal to or greater than the information provided by a Tripod lynch.  thus my vote.<br>\n<br>\ni think that's as clear as i can make it.  ball is in your court, derangement.", "time": "Wed Feb 25, 2015 10:31 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=60738&start=350", "forum": "53", "thread": "60738"}

I do see Marquis mildly town-reading Prawn and Prawn wholeheartedly town-reading him back.  is that what buddying means?  it does seem a tad strong reaction from Prawn assuming the same lack of information we all have on Marquis.  Again, the Pro-town method include changing your opinion slowly and showing the evidence that changed it.  This was a fast change of opinion.  making it anti-town, possibly scummy.<br>\n<br>\nNeither of these 2 points are worth lynching over, but they are totally worth keeping in mind.  I'd like to study the case against Prawn in depth, but people disregarded my 326, so i lack the direct evidence to do such.  Our lazy players HATE going back and digging out questions from previous posts apparently, so i'll repeat the questions here and add some new ones.<br>\n<br>\n@Prawn, in 139 you list townreads for Telltale, Equinox, Tripod, Derangement and GIF, and a suspicion of Llama. Do you still hold these views? Care to add/subtract/change/be useful about any of these? its been a long time since then. Why are you voting for Llama?<br>\n<br>\n@GIF, do you think Llama is scum?  Why or why not?<br>\n<br>\n@Bubs, you were voting for Prawn for a bit.  were you voting for him because you hated how he didn't explain things?  Has your opinion changed?  Why do you prefer a Marquis lynch over a Prawn lynch?<br>\n<br>\n@Llama, did you REALLY vote for Prawn because he was making fun of your votes, calling them 'preservation votes'?  What other reasons do you have?<br>\n<br>\n@Equinox, caught up yet?  Tell me about your vote on Prawn.  what is the most convincing case to you?", "time": "Thu Feb 26, 2015 7:48 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=60738&start=400", "forum": "53", "thread": "60738"}

Well, up to sns posting at least.  what came before his history, but what came with that is 'current' and not suitable for deep thinks yet.  <br>\n<br>\nI think Prawn suspects Llama for the following reasons.  Prawn, please let me know if there's anything else i should add.<br>\n<br>\nEndangered Llamas Case (Prawn&#8217;s case on Llama)<br>\nLlama said &#8216;preservation vote&#8217; first, not Prawn.  Llama, when pressured with many many votes very early on, chose to first 100 vote for Tripod whom had 2 votes on him, and then 303 vote for Prawn, whom had 1 vote on him.  This indicates bandwagoining rather than scumhunting.  Also, Prawn dislikes Llama&#8217;s 047, being an attack on GIF, another example of Llama going for the easy target.  Since, Llama has continued to argue with Prawn, never stating a decisive point.<br>\n<br>\nI think Prawn likes GIF due to his reaction WAYYYY back about the Cogito List 018.  do you like GIF for any other reason?<br>\n<br>\nI think Prawn likes Marquisslot because Marquis town read him in 362, despite Prawn being at 2 votes, which apparently made him 'unpopular'.  Seems like a goofy reason to like someone.  2 votes is rather small.  Llama was also at 2 votes, so Marquis town-reading Prawn is also supporting the Llamalynch counter-wagon.  Its not really something to town-read someone for.<br>\n<br>\nI think Prawn wanted to lynch Bubs, recommending it in 296, 314, then backs off in 340, then is back on 417, then back off again 454.  Now he voted for Bub's replacement sns in 479.  For not actually having a case on Bubs, or any evidence that he's scummy, Prawn's been on this for quite a while.  its suspicious. <br>\n<br>\nIn 407, Prawn calls misrepresentation on Llama, but he's wrong.  Prawn was denying that people found his things scummy as Llama stated.  I've already responded to this in 408.  It feels like Prawn was trying to alienate Llama rather than hold to a logical, evidence based case against him.  its suspicious.<br>\n<br>\nPrawn likes TellTale's 071 (from 139) because its TellTale agreeing with him, then like CBD's 151 (from 417) ragging on TellTale's reads, which is a bit strange.  He kinda supports Tripod in 434 as well.  oh and he likes me in 417 as well.<br>\n<br>\nSo prawn's been on Llama forever, with such vengeance that they ought not both be scum.  He's got a strange, scummy, fixation on lynching Bubsslot, which is yeah a bit scummy.  His case on Llama hasn't been crystal clean, but at least he's stuck to it.  Stick-to is Pro-town.  He lurk-read Marquis, then liked him, which isn't scummy in itself, but his reason for liking marquis is an overreaction and anti-town.  oh yeah and he was bright eye'd and bushy tail'd at the dawn of day 1.  scum are more on-the-ball about that sort of thing.  <br>\n<br>\nConclusion, Prawn's actions as of before sns are just a bit scummy. but just a bit.  why the wagon on him?  i trust derangement so<br>\n<br>\nDerangement, you voted Prawn in 425 because of his place on the Llamawagon (as stated in 411).  is that the case?  why do you find his position suspicious?

Deep thinks about tripod are going to be hard because he as 100 fucking posts, but i'll try to justify that one down hard, and let everyone know exactly what the things are that we should lynch him for.  marquis too.  i suspect i really am just mad at him for lying, but maybe there's something in there.  <br>\n<br>\nI've always been a bit iffy about the pro-townness of roleclaims.  Ideally power roles don't get into a situation where they need to claim or get lynched, but it happens because we kinda suck.  in these situations its more pro-town to reveal your power role and eat the night kill than it is to let the town lynch you.  this is because you, as a power role, know that whoever it is they lynch other than you stands a better chance of being scum than you do, because you are town-aligned.  <br>\n<br>\nthere's a little strange caveat in this because often the power roles don't count towards the number of townies alive to prevent scum victory, and so it seems like it would be possible for a situation to arise in which risking them lynching a VT is more dangerous than letting them lynch you.  it's probably only clear in hindsight though.  plus that was sorta off topic, so back to the topic.<br>\n<br>\nusually it is not in the town's interests for a power role to claim, because it is better to keep them hidden from the scum.  for example, a cop randomly claiming would result in the scum NKing him, and that would be bad.  But because its less bad than lynching the cop and letting the scum NK someone else, the roleclaim becomes pro-town.  its choosing the lesser of two bad situations.<br>\n<br>\nso related to our game.  I requested NJAC to claim when he wasn't at L-1 and you see this as suspect.  This means that you think it would be harmful to the town for him to claim in this situation.  If he had a power role, and Marquis fake claimed, it would be harmful for him to real-claim now, and it would be scummy of me to cause that.  if he didn't have a power role, and marquis claimed true or is scum and false claimed, it would be valuable to the town to know that NJAC thinks the claim served his win condition, whichever it may be.  <br>\n<br>\nRight now its exactly like Marquis didn't claim, and we didn't lynch the lying lurker for no reason.  because we can't believe his claim.  i'm mad at him for being so utterly worthless and throwing into question the only thing that wasn't useless.  i don't see any NJAC in the coming 3 pages, which means he's STILL lurking and we STILL have no information on him, and we STILL didn't lynch the lurker liar for no reason.<br>\n<br>\nSo i acknowledge your questions derangement.  I'd hope NJAC would make up for Marquis but he isn't, and the only situation where NJAC re-claiming would be harmful to us is if he really had a power role and really claimed it, which is both unlikely, and i'd very probably not believe him unless he had some evidence.  in every other situation, NJAC re-claiming would provide us with a tiny little bit of information, which would be good because right now i have exactly zero information on him.  <br>\n<br>\n-=-<br>\n<br>\n489 sns - sheesh inner rage much?<br>\n<br>\n496 TellTale - sorry to be ignoring you and hay read my posts dag nabbit.  i work hard on those.  but had i read this post before posting my Prawn Deep Think i'd probably have said something about it.  it really seems like there was no case on Prawn.<br>\n<br>\ni do see 498 TellTale here heavily pushing a lynch on NJAC or Llama.  they seem reasonable possible lynches, but the heavy push is a bit off-putting.  <br>\n<br>\n499 CBD - but but but... <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\">  and CBD 501 wants me to move my vote as well.  <br>\n<br>\n506 Equinox - yeah um, see response to Derangement above.<br>\nWhere IS NJAC anyway...<br>\n<br>\n511-523 TellTale and Tripod - i don't know if it fits the definition of role-fishing or PR hunting.

However, both backoffings (079 and 080) were really very weak and under justified.  I feel like a townie who suspected GIF would be more suspicious of GIF&#8217;s wonky behavior, not less.

I could move my vote to three other people and they would have the same number of votes as UT has now.

This is me asking why you are voting for Tripod, and what i get is you lumping me into this preservation vote argument with Prawn, which you invented and the rest of us adopted.

You were right in 386 at least, and i&#8217;d be willing to agree that you were both useless.  Pretty sure 389 doesn&#8217;t make any sense at all.  in 405 you state your own reasons as GIF&#8217;s 296 and 384, which i&#8217;ll agree are slightly mildly scummy.  its not worth a lynch though.  <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Llama 421 wrote:</cite>Notice how Prawn immediately dismissed (again) my push on him by saying that only I saw things as scummy.

Looking at my role I expected at most two others, and if scum has no roles, I am it.  If it looked right to claim D2 (dead scum, lots of prob town players, result on a player getting votes) I absolutely would have claimed right there.<br>\n<br>\nThe argument for tracking VT that has claimed, especially if I am reading number of scum right, is that if scum (before all this happened) they would be most likely to submit a kill as the player who is already claimed is usually the \"expendable\" one, and just statistically in a two scum setup the chance of getting a \"false positive\" meaning hitting scum who didn't act is low enough to justify a significant town tell.  That and if they are scum with a role, they would be dead in the water.  The fact that UT doesn't understand the strength of a \"no action\" on a VT claim from a tracker is REALLY concerning to me.  Tracking a player who goes nowhere is a little below the lines of a cop clear, especially if there are two scum because there would be literally only one role that generates a false positive in that case.<br>\n<br>\nBasically assuming a target lives through the night and went nowhere is about 12% more likely to be town than an average player.  As tracker you want to be shooting for a player who should give you a \"went nowhere\" result, what better role to do that then claimed VT?<br>\n<br>\nIn the all, it basically produces two players scum would need to nightkill to get rid of.  Which is going to limit their ability to get rid of whoever they want to each night as priorities emerge<br>\n<br>\n@onion - You really think Prawn as town makes the onion comment, only says its a reaction test after Equinox and I said he was scum for it.  Then calls Marquis null for lurking and says he would hammer.  Then calls Marquis town after Marquis called Prawn slight town.  Then decided that what he thought Marquis was town for was something that happened multiple pages AFTER Prawn called him town?  He literally changed his reasoning as to why a player was town from a shifty reason to something that doesn't line up with the timeline of the game.", "time": "Wed Mar 04, 2015 8:55 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=60738&start=575", "forum": "53", "thread": "60738"}

It looks like LlamaFluff responded \"don't use the shot on Night 1\" to the hypotheticals where 1) VT was lynched on Day 1, 2) PR was lynched on Day 1, and 3) PR (vigilante) claimed but VT was lynched. The flip side of this is that he would only hold back if he knew he was going to survive to do so, so it makes sense here that he would use his shot on Night 1. The other thing is that his reasoning in that thread is pretty similar to what he was saying here about wanting to \"clear\" NJAC's slot for what a \"No Target\" result is worth.<br>\n<br>\nI think I'm just really, really scared of mislynching LlamaFluff, and that fear is now doubled because he's a claimed tracker. My instinct here is to let him go, but I also hesitate to lynch NJAC because I agree that Marquis's behavior is less indicative of scum.

Typically when someone attacks you, you have to respond. Someone saying you're scum is typically distracting from scum hunting. So yes, \"saving his skin\" when you put a wagon on him for no reason sounds like a logical way to go. But wait, because you put the random wagon on him, he was forced to try and counter it, but apparently that's not what you want. That just means he's scum because he's trying to prevent a mislynch. Silly me. <br>\n<br>\nSo this is your argument:<br>\nYou set llama on fire.<br>\nHe tries to put out the fire.<br>\nYou say he's scum because he's not looking for scum.<br>\nWell hot damn, that's some round-a-bout logic right there.

You're assuming that scum are going to be later on a wagon, and you're also assuming -- with your \"scum-o-meter\" -- that town are less likely to vote town than scum are. The latter assumption is especially dangerous because, surprise, scummy people get voted. Your conclusion that Derangement might be scum just because Derangement was at or near the top of both lists is also likely to be incorrect, and scum could have just not killed Derangement for other reasons. GuyInFreezer said that he was going to reveal something Today, for instance.<br>\n<br>\nAnyway, I was going to read prawneater (and LlamaFluff and snscompt1) but didn't because I'm a master procrastinator.

As I mentioned before, LlamaFluff's reasoning matches what he said in Mafia Discussion some years ago, which admittedly only tells me that his thought process has been consistent. Again, the last thing I want to do is mislynch LlamaFluff -- been there, done that -- and, having read this most recent spate of interactions, I'm finally getting the sense that this isn't the usual LlamaFluff. This is what bugs me most because I don't understand what to do with that read, as most of my experience with him has been either misreading him as town or not caring because I was scum.<br>\n<br>\nIf I wanted to take the onion route of doing things, lynching LlamaFluff would be an okay thing to do. He's used up his shot, so that's not a reason to keep him around anymore. I'm not writing off his reasons for tracking Untrod Tripod because that is consistent with the LlamaFluff I know, but, now that he tells Derangement in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6671601#p6671601\">post 729</a> that everyone besides his town reads are \"null at best,\" it rubs me the wrong way. LlamaFluff should have gotten a read on me by now.<br>\n<br>\nOverall, I'm really hesitant to do anything right now because I don't have as great of a grip on this game as I'd like. Having a handful of solid town reads is one thing, but I can really go back and forth on everyone else and the fact that the most helpful thing I can do to fix that is to read the damned thread again is itself the roadblock to clarifying those reads. Having to write a thesis on a relatively short deadline isn't helping, either.<br>\n<br>\n...that was probably way, way more than what you wanted from me.

If you flip tracker, i would actually feel a lot better about Tripod, because he is one of MY major scumreads, and someone I would have considered tracking.

This looked like onion had tipped his hand about knowing Llama's (town) alignment.  Rereading, though, I see that in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6609522#p6609522\">Post 180</a>, onion is saying that all slots on any bandwagon (except first and hammer) are suspicious.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Why it's alignment indicative:</div>  I still think this points to a scum perspective, and knowledge about Llama's alignment.  I'm not convinced this universal aspect of the theory in Post 180 really allays my suspicions about onion preemptively suspecting the folks on Llama's bandwagon.  Assuming for the sake of argument that all slots on a town bandwagon are scummy, per onion's theory, that wouldn't hold true for slots on a scum bandwagon.  That is, onion has taken a questionable principle that applies to reviewing <div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">town bandwagons</div>, and has preemptively applied it to Llama's bandwagon while also still suspecting Llama.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">5.

Thus 'this guy will produce lots of info on flip' is a good point to consider when picking who to lynch.  nothing is the ONLY thing to lynch on (well, ya know except for scum-claims and stuff) but it's totally a reason to pick one scummy person over another.  <br>\n<br>\n3) yes, but its because i hate him.  you'll be happy to know i calmed down about it though, see post 775.<br>\n<br>\n4) um, the suspicious seats on the bandwagon are the not-first-or-last regardless of the flip.  scum want to lynch townies, so will pile on, and scum want to be on wagons that lynch scum if the wagon is going to happen anyway.  what scum don't want to do is place a first vote on their buddy, then push the case, work it up and finally lynch them, because that's a lot of work that could have been put into lynching a townie instead.  its just self-defeating.  so middle seats are just scummy.  early seats are more scummy on town-wagons and later seats are more scummy on scum-wagons.  maybe the hammer is scummy on scum-wagons i dunno, case by case.<br>\n<br>\n5) people keep bringing this up and i'm fuzzy on it.  we know there's (at least was) power roles out there, and we can suss out kinda sorta what they ought to be by what we know, and we can use this information to judge people's roleclaims, and that's useful.  i've always assumed that our power roles aren't going to be like 'oh you talking about doctors thats me!' because that would be entirely terrible.  but i don't really get why people consider the discussion of roles without claims to be scummy.  please tell me.<br>\n<br>\n--) that god damn drunk housemate thing again.  its really truly my drunk housemate.  he's funny because he's dumb, and this time he read the list of names and picked some people.  i posted them so that at the end of the game i'll know if it turned out he was right or not and that'll be funny too.

Bad entry into the game.</div>  I'm always a bit iffy in terms of evaluating RVS-stage play, but Llama entered into the game in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6600966#p6600966\">Post 47</a> with one foot decidedly outside of RVS, so I feel comfortable in saying that it was bad and reflective of his alignment.  I really nothing the \"oh and UT\" tag at the end (insofar that I saw the theory that Llama was \"keeping his options open\" or whatever, because it's not alignment indicative to suspect more than one player at one time), as it's the GIF suspicions that bother me in particular.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Why it's alignment indicative:</div> Llama's GIF-suspicions are not actually of alignment-indicative play - any alignment could accept Equinox's theory as valid, but then dispute whether any particular player fell under that theory's umbrella.  It's a technical argument being made early on that doesn't hold up to scrutiny, which suggests that Llama was really stretching to find something scummy about something.  This is particularly true as Llama was selected by the thread to get early D1 pressure to post.  Llama's immediate follow up in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6601518#p6601518\">Post 59</a> confirm this understanding.<br>\n<br>\nI remain unconvinced by Llama's restatements in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6614790#p6614790\">Post 234</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6615101#p6615101\">Post 237</a>, which read more like Llama having to defend a suspicion he's married to rather than actual belief.  This read of 234 and 237 is because Llama appears to be shifting the goalposts to make his position better:  first it was why didn't GIF do the town thing and question the validity of Equinox's scum pool (a why question), rather than do the scum thing and question why GIF was part of that pool; now it is why didn't GIF do the town thing and just shrug at the scum pool and ignore it, rather than do the scum thing and question Equinox at all (any why question)?<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">2.  Inordinate focus on the early D1 L-1.</div>  Who cares?  It's not a big deal.  IF Llama is town AND IF Llama got quick lynched on D1 THEN hammer and setup would (rightly) come under scrutiny.

Llama's prawn-suspicions are forced.</div>  I agree with a few of prawn's Llama suspicions (e.g., GIF suspicions), and disagree with a few of prawn's Llama suspicions (e.g., Llama trying to make a counterwagon rather than figure out the game in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6609313#p6609313\">Post 174</a>, which I don't think is inherently scum play).  I think it's important to make that distinction because even though I disagree with that initial suspicion, I think Llama's reaction is suspicious.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Why it's alignment indicative:</div> Llama eventually shifts to a prawn vote for that latter suspicion (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6621077#p6621077\">Post 303</a>), which I think prawn rightly identifies as a mischaracterization of prawn's position (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6626126#p6626126\">Post 340</a>).  Llama's framing of prawn's position makes it easier for Llama to justify his prawn-vote.  Llama also further warps prawn's position in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6627086#p6627086\">Post 356</a>), focusing on whether prawn's criticism amounts to whether Llama was engaging in \"self-preservation\" (not sure where that term came from, I don't see prawn using it at all), rather than to prawn's actual point:  that Llama didn't appear to be trying to figure out the game and vote accordingly, and instead was simply trying to get the thread's vote momentum thrown onto someone - anyone - else.<br>\n<br>\nFrom there on out, Llama goes down a prawn-is-scum rabbit hole.  Admittedly, this possibly suggests a town tunnel, but with the basic setup of the prawn-suspicions as discussed above, Llama trying to throw everything including the kitchen sink at prawn could equally be Llama-scum trying to mimic a town tunnel.<br>\n<br>\nAlso, some of the accusations are just jaw-droppingly desperate material (see <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6637195#p6637195\">Post 438</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6637481#p6637481\">Post 441</a>, and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6637531#p6637531\">Post 442</a>) that I would think Llama-town would take a moment to reflect and evaluate and weed out such accusations, rather than just try to see what sticks.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">4.  One-shot tracker is a scum-lean claim.</div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Why it's alignment indicative:</div>  If a scum was going to claim a PR, a one-shot tracker is not a bad claim.  Particularly if the power is over on N1, and the result is not really helpful (a no movement operates as a 50% town result if we're assuming 2 person scum group).  His PR claim keeps him alive by the town, and his expenditure of his only night action justifies why he hasn't been killed by the scum.<br>\n<br>\nAs for Llama's convoluted plan of keeping Marquis alive to track Marquis, I don't think that's inherently alignment indicative, though it's sure as shit convoluted.  What bothers me more than the alleged plan, though, is Equinox's observation (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6649943#p6649943\">Post 625</a>) that Llama is well versed in normal roles and has already thought up optimal tracker-town play.

Thus 'this guy will produce lots of info on flip' is a good point to consider when picking who to lynch.  nothing is the ONLY thing to lynch on (well, ya know except for scum-claims and stuff) but it's totally a reason to pick one scummy person over another.  <br>\n<br>\n3) yes, but its because i hate him.  you'll be happy to know i calmed down about it though, see post 775.<br>\n<br>\n4) um, the suspicious seats on the bandwagon are the not-first-or-last regardless of the flip.  scum want to lynch townies, so will pile on, and scum want to be on wagons that lynch scum if the wagon is going to happen anyway.  what scum don't want to do is place a first vote on their buddy, then push the case, work it up and finally lynch them, because that's a lot of work that could have been put into lynching a townie instead.  its just self-defeating.  so middle seats are just scummy.  early seats are more scummy on town-wagons and later seats are more scummy on scum-wagons.  maybe the hammer is scummy on scum-wagons i dunno, case by case.<br>\n<br>\n5) people keep bringing this up and i'm fuzzy on it.  we know there's (at least was) power roles out there, and we can suss out kinda sorta what they ought to be by what we know, and we can use this information to judge people's roleclaims, and that's useful.  i've always assumed that our power roles aren't going to be like 'oh you talking about doctors thats me!' because that would be entirely terrible.  but i don't really get why people consider the discussion of roles without claims to be scummy.  please tell me.<br>\n<br>\n--) that god damn drunk housemate thing again.  its really truly my drunk housemate.  he's funny because he's dumb, and this time he read the list of names and picked some people.  i posted them so that at the end of the game i'll know if it turned out he was right or not and that'll be funny too.

Could have sworn it was much less.<br>\n<br>\nFor onion, I was looking for personality tells, specifically if there were any differences in his tone between his town and scum games.

That's not the greatest term for it, but I would expect that someone who was fooled by another player would become more wary of said player in future games.

This looked like onion had tipped his hand about knowing Llama's (town) alignment.  Rereading, though, I see that in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6609522#p6609522\">Post 180</a>, onion is saying that all slots on any bandwagon (except first and hammer) are suspicious.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Why it's alignment indicative:</div>  I still think this points to a scum perspective, and knowledge about Llama's alignment.  I'm not convinced this universal aspect of the theory in Post 180 really allays my suspicions about onion preemptively suspecting the folks on Llama's bandwagon.  Assuming for the sake of argument that all slots on a town bandwagon are scummy, per onion's theory, that wouldn't hold true for slots on a scum bandwagon.  That is, onion has taken a questionable principle that applies to reviewing <div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">town bandwagons</div>, and has preemptively applied it to Llama's bandwagon while also still suspecting Llama.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">5.
