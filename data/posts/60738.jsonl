The core logic behind the vote is also pretty strained; I would actually expect scum to have a stick up his butt about the tell being brought up at all.  There's also the matter of the UT read.  Llama forgoes analysis of UT's posting or a vote for UT for a glib sentence about being willing to vote him.  This is strange since UT has a lot more content to analyze and already has a vote on him.  If you really did think UT was scum, that seems like it would be the logical place to start.

So how come, when you have a player who's posted twice and a player who's posted ten times, do you have more faith in your read of the person with only 20% as many posts as the other to the point that you would be willing to vote for them first?

I'm sorry, but until I get an explanation (no, Untrod Tripod, a name of a technique and a basic definition of what it is doesn't count as an explanation) of why a townie would do such a thing, I cannot see rushing someone to L-1 as being anything but scummy.

LlamaFluff switched his vote to you after GuyInFreezer posted his reads in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6603965#p6603965\" class=\"postlink\">post 79</a> and then some, and, again, it wouldn't be unreasonable to think that he switched because the degrees to which he suspected the two of you changed.<br><br>I'll admit that I'm basically making leaps here based on what I think LlamaFluff meant, and it'd be impossible now to ask. There's enough reasonable doubt for me (and then some) to make me consider not lynching LlamaFluff."}

Equinox did a pro-town thing posting the list, and we all know that equinox was on it, and its even named after him.  I removed him from the list because i feel like if he were scum he'd either not have posted it, or removed himself from it, or defended himself from his own list in his post.  he did none of these things, he's probably not the 1 scum on the list.<br><br>I think bubs plays pretty pro-town.  he's useful to keep around, and his straight forward playstyle would make him easier to catch if he were scum.  We ought not lynch him under current situations because he's helping the town regardless of alignment.  He's also mildly town.<br><br>Equinox 173 (paraphrased)<br>\"Why are Tripod and Llama different alignments?\"<br>\"What about the Cogito List Case?\"<br>\"Why is Bub's fishy?\"<br>\"the other one\"<br><br>If both Tripod and Llama were scum, tripod placing him at L-1 would have been safe because they know no scum would derphammer it.  If a townie derphammered it, they'd lynch the townie next day and trade 1 for 1, which is a losing tactic for scum.  It wouldn't even produce towncred for Tripod, it'd be just useless.  So they are probably not both scum.<br><br>If both were town, then the scum are just loving this, and at least one would totally be on the wagon.<br><br>Sidenote: The Llamawagon was CBD(004), Telltale(016), Equinox(017), Prawn(025), Tripod(034).<br> <br>The suspicious slots on the Llamawagon are held by CBD, Telltale and Equinox.  I think Equinox is townish, but the other two are entirely reasonable possible-scum.  I got some things to say about CBD in any case (see below).<br><br>The Cogito List Case will very probably remain interesting until at least 1 person on it dies.  I really like the way Equinox laid it out for us, and there really probably is a scum to be found there.  We shouldn't just start at the top and lynch downward, but anyone on the list is suspicious because they are on the list.<br><br>Bubs is fishy but not very scummy.  I love vote patterns and vote analysis, and finding that little tidbit was pretty fun.  I don't know if it means anything, but if llama flipped scum and prawn or tripod flip town, or if llama flips powerrole, it might add meaning to this thing.<br><br>ok and now the other one... its um \"What do you think of the people who have voiced disagreement with the case against LlamaFluff?\u201d<br><br>I'm a little shaky on what the case against Llama actually is.  I know what my case against him is, but nobody's else has really made it plain why they were voting for him.  CBD and Telltale's votes were RVS, Equinox gave meta+bad math reasons which better damn well be tongue in cheek or he should go back and take high school statistics again.  Prawn provided no reasons what so ever, and Tripod has stated plenty that it's a pressure vote or a lolvote depending on how anti-town he feels at the moment.<br><br>My case against Llama is that 1, his process of vote GIF, FOS Tripod (047), GIF says good things about Llama (079, 080), then Llama moves his vote to Tripod, whom he FOS'd (100) seems rather planned out.  Its just got an evil scum plan vibe to it.  And 2, he's on the Cogito List.<br><br>So the question is what do i think about the people who have voiced disagreements with this?  I'm having a bit of a hard time figuring out who you are referring to.  Nobody has obviously defended llama.  Tripod 55 likes his idgaf attitude, which Tripod would like, because he's anti-town, and thus a poor defense.  GIF praises Llama's bias in 79 and 80, but that doesn't have anything to do with the cases either.  <br><br>So yeah, you're gonna have to help me answer your question by pointing out who disagreed with the case.  sorry.<br><br>In 166, CBD says \"You(TellTale) should tell us your reads on everyone.\" and yeah no you shouldn't.  Lists of reads are great fuel for scum and not all that helpful for town.  Its great to be like 'top 2 bottom 2' and all that, because its important that we know what you're up to, but complete lists are pretty much 'NK people in this order' lists, which isn't something i want the scum to know.  Plus they provide plenty of un-useful nitpicking about why mildly-scummy person A is above mildly-scummy person B, instead of discussing whoever's actually at the top or bottom.  Lists are bad.  bad bad lists.<br><br>Also in 142, CBD is like ima just hop on this wagon if you don't mind for no reason.  right in the good ol suspicious #3 seat.  He was on the Llamawagon as well, granted in a less suspicious seat.  Also also, as Bub's pointed out in 099, CBD is kinda lacking in useful content.<br><br>CBD might be scum."}

Therefore there is at least one town-aligned player who has this idea in their heads that they don't need to explain their votes when they make them, only when it's demanded.<br><br>OK, I can buy that the amount of votes needed to put pressure on someone is L-2 rather than the 3 I thought it was in the beginning. It's difficult but I can buy that Untrod Tripod is just a naturally reckless player and that the act of placing a L-1 vote on LlamaFluff is not a scum-motivated move.<br><br>But this?<br><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/qOixygj.gif\" alt=\"Image\"><br>(whatiswrongwithyoupeople.gif - yay, I did a Homestar Runner gif and my name is a Homestar Runner reference!)<br><br>Where did you get this idea from? Why do you not feel the need to justify your votes when you make them? Votes are things that cause people to become out of the game, we need to make sure it's the right people who are becoming out of the game, we achieve this by observing, thinking and sharing our observations and thoughts, and you think it's perfectly fine townie behaviour to cast votes without stating your rationale for them? Since when does the town benefit from you hiding the reasoning behind your actions?<br><br>No no no no no, town benefits from information being in the open. There <span style=\"font-style: italic\">is</span> good reason to hide the contents of role PMs since we don't want scum knowing where the power roles are (or where they aren't), but apart from that, sharing information means we can get different perspectives from each other that we might not have thought of on our own. It's the old adage of two heads being better than one, but amplified to however many townies are in this game. By placing a vote without explaining it, you are withholding useful information that can improve the accuracy of our reads and increase our chances of lynching scum (and, by extension, winning).<br><br>It's a good thing then that some folks have been prodding people for the explanations for their unexplained votes, otherwise scum would have an incredibly easy game and we'd be more fucked than 15 prostitutes by the end of their shift!<br><br>While the rationales behind my votes were couched in questions, demands and sarcasm when I made them, at least they were there. LlamaFluff was even better about it with <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6600966#p6600966\">his</a> <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6604640#p6604640\">votes</a> in that he explicitly stated why he voted for someone in the posts that he did. Say what you will about the quality of his reasoning, but at least it was there. Only his lack of explanation for why he would also have voted Untrod Tripod in his first post was a problem in that regard.<br><br>Why do so many of you find it so hard to be so explicit about your reasoning before someone prods you into giving the reasoning? Why does explicitly giving your reasoning with your vote not come naturally to you? Apart from the contents of your role PM, what could those of you who are townies possibly have to hide?</div></div></div><br><br>Further thoughts will come when I'm calmer."}

Some people (me, maybe bubs) are lurk-reading you, but you can fix that by catching up and being active and useful.  please do that.  <br><br>I'm sorry about the drunken housemate thing.  i didn't know it would confuse the game, and when i did i tried to stop it but its just confusing the game anyway.  sorry.  but at least apparnelty it helped Tripod get a townread on Llama i think? which is kinda strange i think?  being that one of them is very probably scum i think?  either town-Tripod is continuing his anti-town antics or scum-Tripod is buddying up with town-Llama to avoid the lynch that kinda sorta looked like was heading towards Llama anyway?  i dunno.<br><br>and speaking of llama, please don't just not answer my questions.  answer them or tell me you are not going to answer them.  one of the two.<br><br>@bubs, while the mafia playing crowd consists of older-than-average-internet-user individuals, i bet nobody knows what homestar runner is.  it even updated like 6 months ago too! <br><br>I'm not really up with all this html blocking code stuff, and it seems like adding hotlinks to every post number i use would be a lot of work, but i'll try it next big post and see if it isn't the most annoying thing ever.  I think that most people don't look up the posts i'm talking about very often, and so hotlinking them might very well be a waste of time.  we'll see.<br><br>You and Derangement post posts that are rich in information.  You respond directly to questions and seem to express yourselves in a method i find easy to understand, unlike llama who i can't seem to understand what he means when he types stuff.  Providing the town with easy to use information is pro-town.  It helps the town catch scum even if its the scum who are being pro-town.  yall probably already know all this being veteran players and all but<br><br>Pro-town actions are ones that make the actor easier to catch if they are scum.  They involve expressing your suspicious and showing how they evolve over time, and what evidence convinced you to change your mind.  They also involve avoiding things that are mathematically bad for the town such as voting during MyLo and stuff like that.<br><br>Anti-town actions are the other ones.  Things that confuse everyone, make it harder to scumhunt, and make you harder to catch if you are scum.  Stuff like lurking.  Many policy lynches are designed to discourage anti-town play and force the scum to be pro-town and easier to catch.  I'm not sure that policy lynches actually do that, but its probably their intention.  <br><br>Note that pro-town doesn't mean town and anti-town doesn't mean scum, it is just a method of defining how a player plays.  Tripod plays anti-town and everything might get fucked up because of him, but he might be town and we probably shouldn't policy lynch him for his antics because at least he's active.  What i'm trying to say is anti-towns aren't always scum.  they are just harder to catch when they are scum, and so should be beaten with a giant stick until they behave. <br><br>I agree with Derangement's 133 post.  It is entirely possible that some people have town and scum tells that come out over multiple games, and that it might be possible to use them to your advantage in a current game.  However, the more they are used the less likely they are to keep working.  Its probably bad practice to rely on them too heavily, but hey a clue is a clue.<br><br>Also, yes please everyone, explain your votes in the post that contains the vote.  its pro-town, pyo.<br><br>PS AND HAY YOU GIF EXPLAIN YOUR UNVOTE RIGHT NOW YOUNG MAN.  geez do you even read the thread?"}

Its not like I can really add much to that since he hasn't been posting content.  Still have a hard time believing town only reacts in a \"I played with him?\" statement than anything else.

I could move my vote to three other people and they would have the same number of votes as UT has now.  You are using the same poor argument prawn is using where you set it up to no matter who I vote I am apparently voting in self-preservation because its not the only vote for the player.

Because Bubs said he was going to remove the vote, it effectively didn't count for anything and might as well not have been placed.  However, slow voting, and explaining what you are doing before you do it are pro-town, and there was nothing at all wrong with saying you'd vote for marquis in 24 hours and then doing it.  its just that voting for prawn in the meantime was strange.<br><br>Right, and now to continue the logic argument with Derangement.<br>are we actually arguing an in-game suspicion here, or just the symbolism used to represent it?  i mean, you aren't actually arguing that we should lynch Tripod before Llama, are you?  <br><br>312 proves that you know a lot more about this than i do, so help me out.  how would i write the statement i want?

Then i'll add in other things later in this post.<br><br>if we identify Llama's alignment, before Tripod's, it provides us with some useful information, regardless of which alignment he flips.  <br>1 If Llama flips scum, it means that Tripod L-1'd a scum, meaning that Tripod is probably town.<br>2 if Llama flips town, it means that Tripod L-1'd a townie, meaning that Tripod is even more scummy than we currently thought.<br>Both of these bits of information are very valuable to us, and it would be useful to have them.<br><br>If we identify Tripod's alignment before Llama's, it still provides us with useful information, but its not AS USEFUL as the previous example.<br>3 If Tripod flips scum, it means a scum L-1'd somellama, making that somellama probably town.<br>4 If Tripod flips town, it means that a townie L-1'd somellama, which doesn't say much about Llama's alignment. <br><br>Now, lets add in Tripod's known anti-town, unreliable behavior.  it indicates that he might L-1 someone for the lolz, and might do this as town.  it seems that its almost a null-tell for him.  this weakens situation 4 even more, becuase now its a chaotic anti-town townie L-1ing someone, which hardly means anything at all.  <br><br>And so, disregarding the scummyness of either of the 2 targets, it seems logical to lynch Llama first, because it provides equally useful info on a scumflip and better information on a townflip than the Tripod lynch would.<br><br>I believe that both tripod and llama are about equally scummy.  Tripod is anti-town and dangerous and crazy, while Llama blends into the background, chooses to disregard questions asked of him, and places only votes that are popular.  either one could easily be scum.  Also, they are both on the Cogito List, so there's that as well.  Because both are pretty scummy, we should probably lynch at least one of em some time, and as of right now, the information provided by a Llama lynch is equal to or greater than the information provided by a Tripod lynch.  thus my vote.<br><br>i think that's as clear as i can make it.  ball is in your court, derangement."}

If we policy lynch Marquis today, we should try not to entirely forget about this case come day 2.<br><br>My vote will remain on Llama for the time being, because he has more votes than Tripod right now."}

Why or why not?<br><br>@Bubs, you were voting for Prawn for a bit.  were you voting for him because you hated how he didn't explain things?  Has your opinion changed?  Why do you prefer a Marquis lynch over a Prawn lynch?<br><br>@Llama, did you REALLY vote for Prawn because he was making fun of your votes, calling them 'preservation votes'?  What other reasons do you have?<br><br>@Equinox, caught up yet?  Tell me about your vote on Prawn.  what is the most convincing case to you?"}

Llama's really kicked up his game recently, and is explaining himself better, making better decisions.  Maybe its just Llamascum figuring out what i want and giving it to me, i dunno.

Then he says Marquis calling him town is a towntell (after being called out on intent to hammer Marquis on bad reasoning) because he is an unpopular player.

When he does decide to actually do something, its scummy.  Dismissing a case as OMGUS, changing reasoning behind votes afterwards, lurking, the whole onion thing which immediately changed to \"reaction testing\" when called on it.  He needs to be dead here.  The last thing game related thing he has said is \"Marquis lurking is not indicative of alignment - I would lynch them for it\".

Well, up to sns posting at least.  what came before his history, but what came with that is 'current' and not suitable for deep thinks yet.  <br><br>I think Prawn suspects Llama for the following reasons.  Prawn, please let me know if there's anything else i should add.<br><br>Endangered Llamas Case (Prawn\u2019s case on Llama)<br>Llama said \u2018preservation vote\u2019 first, not Prawn.  Llama, when pressured with many many votes very early on, chose to first 100 vote for Tripod whom had 2 votes on him, and then 303 vote for Prawn, whom had 1 vote on him.  This indicates bandwagoining rather than scumhunting.  Also, Prawn dislikes Llama\u2019s 047, being an attack on GIF, another example of Llama going for the easy target.  Since, Llama has continued to argue with Prawn, never stating a decisive point.<br><br>I think Prawn likes GIF due to his reaction WAYYYY back about the Cogito List 018.  do you like GIF for any other reason?<br><br>I think Prawn likes Marquisslot because Marquis town read him in 362, despite Prawn being at 2 votes, which apparently made him 'unpopular'.  Seems like a goofy reason to like someone.  2 votes is rather small.  Llama was also at 2 votes, so Marquis town-reading Prawn is also supporting the Llamalynch counter-wagon.  Its not really something to town-read someone for.<br><br>I think Prawn wanted to lynch Bubs, recommending it in 296, 314, then backs off in 340, then is back on 417, then back off again 454.  Now he voted for Bub's replacement sns in 479.  For not actually having a case on Bubs, or any evidence that he's scummy, Prawn's been on this for quite a while.  its suspicious. <br><br>In 407, Prawn calls misrepresentation on Llama, but he's wrong.  Prawn was denying that people found his things scummy as Llama stated.  I've already responded to this in 408.  It feels like Prawn was trying to alienate Llama rather than hold to a logical, evidence based case against him.  its suspicious.<br><br>Prawn likes TellTale's 071 (from 139) because its TellTale agreeing with him, then like CBD's 151 (from 417) ragging on TellTale's reads, which is a bit strange.  He kinda supports Tripod in 434 as well.  oh and he likes me in 417 as well.<br><br>So prawn's been on Llama forever, with such vengeance that they ought not both be scum.  He's got a strange, scummy, fixation on lynching Bubsslot, which is yeah a bit scummy.  His case on Llama hasn't been crystal clean, but at least he's stuck to it.  Stick-to is Pro-town.  He lurk-read Marquis, then liked him, which isn't scummy in itself, but his reason for liking marquis is an overreaction and anti-town.  oh yeah and he was bright eye'd and bushy tail'd at the dawn of day 1.  scum are more on-the-ball about that sort of thing.  <br><br>Conclusion, Prawn's actions as of before sns are just a bit scummy. but just a bit.  why the wagon on him?  i trust derangement so<br><br>Derangement, you voted Prawn in 425 because of his place on the Llamawagon (as stated in 411).  is that the case?  why do you find his position suspicious? (i also find it suspicious, but why do you?)<br><br>Alright!  that was a lot of work!  sheesh.  hour break, food and stuff, then i'll get back to it.  i should probably address current pages before continuing my delve into history.  whoosh"}

Deep thinks about tripod are going to be hard because he as 100 fucking posts, but i'll try to justify that one down hard, and let everyone know exactly what the things are that we should lynch him for.  marquis too.  i suspect i really am just mad at him for lying, but maybe there's something in there.  <br><br>I've always been a bit iffy about the pro-townness of roleclaims.  Ideally power roles don't get into a situation where they need to claim or get lynched, but it happens because we kinda suck.  in these situations its more pro-town to reveal your power role and eat the night kill than it is to let the town lynch you.  this is because you, as a power role, know that whoever it is they lynch other than you stands a better chance of being scum than you do, because you are town-aligned.  <br><br>there's a little strange caveat in this because often the power roles don't count towards the number of townies alive to prevent scum victory, and so it seems like it would be possible for a situation to arise in which risking them lynching a VT is more dangerous than letting them lynch you.  it's probably only clear in hindsight though.  plus that was sorta off topic, so back to the topic.<br><br>usually it is not in the town's interests for a power role to claim, because it is better to keep them hidden from the scum.  for example, a cop randomly claiming would result in the scum NKing him, and that would be bad.  But because its less bad than lynching the cop and letting the scum NK someone else, the roleclaim becomes pro-town.  its choosing the lesser of two bad situations.<br><br>so related to our game.  I requested NJAC to claim when he wasn't at L-1 and you see this as suspect.  This means that you think it would be harmful to the town for him to claim in this situation.  If he had a power role, and Marquis fake claimed, it would be harmful for him to real-claim now, and it would be scummy of me to cause that.  if he didn't have a power role, and marquis claimed true or is scum and false claimed, it would be valuable to the town to know that NJAC thinks the claim served his win condition, whichever it may be.  <br><br>Right now its exactly like Marquis didn't claim, and we didn't lynch the lying lurker for no reason.  because we can't believe his claim.  i'm mad at him for being so utterly worthless and throwing into question the only thing that wasn't useless.  i don't see any NJAC in the coming 3 pages, which means he's STILL lurking and we STILL have no information on him, and we STILL didn't lynch the lurker liar for no reason.<br><br>So i acknowledge your questions derangement.  I'd hope NJAC would make up for Marquis but he isn't, and the only situation where NJAC re-claiming would be harmful to us is if he really had a power role and really claimed it, which is both unlikely, and i'd very probably not believe him unless he had some evidence.  in every other situation, NJAC re-claiming would provide us with a tiny little bit of information, which would be good because right now i have exactly zero information on him.  <br><br>-=-<br><br>489 sns - sheesh inner rage much?<br><br>496 TellTale - sorry to be ignoring you and hay read my posts dag nabbit.  i work hard on those.  but had i read this post before posting my Prawn Deep Think i'd probably have said something about it.  it really seems like there was no case on Prawn.<br><br>i do see 498 TellTale here heavily pushing a lynch on NJAC or Llama.  they seem reasonable possible lynches, but the heavy push is a bit off-putting.  <br><br>499 CBD - but but but... <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\">  and CBD 501 wants me to move my vote as well.  <br><br>506 Equinox - yeah um, see response to Derangement above.<br>Where IS NJAC anyway...<br><br>511-523 TellTale and Tripod - i don't know if it fits the definition of role-fishing or PR hunting.

However, both backoffings (079 and 080) were really very weak and under justified.  I feel like a townie who suspected GIF would be more suspicious of GIF\u2019s wonky behavior, not less.

Do you still think he's scum? Or are you just backing the counterwagon to yours? what are your current thoughts about GIF?</div></blockquote><br>Yes. What counter wagon? I could move my vote to three other people and they would have the same number of votes as UT has now. You are using the same poor argument prawn is using where you set it up to no matter who I vote I am apparently voting in self-preservation because its not the only vote for the player.

This is me asking why you are voting for Tripod, and what i get is you lumping me into this preservation vote argument with Prawn, which you invented and the rest of us adopted.  Llama was the first person to say \u2018preservation vote.\u2019  Plus its not even true.  way to be overly defensive and suspicious.<br><br>In 303 you swap your vote over to Prawn, getting annoyed at him for calling your votes \u2018preservation votes\u2019 even though they were and you yourself coined the term, not Prawn.  From here on out we hear nothing about Tripod nor GIF for for\u2026 forever?  i was expecting to fill this in with the post where you get back to them.  hasn\u2019t happened yet.<br><br>I was trying to summarize your case on Prawn and give it a catchy case name, but i just can\u2019t pick it out.  you accuse him of tunneling and being useless, while you tunnel and be useless yourself.  You were right in 386 at least, and i\u2019d be willing to agree that you were both useless.  Pretty sure 389 doesn\u2019t make any sense at all.  in 405 you state your own reasons as GIF\u2019s 296 and 384, which i\u2019ll agree are slightly mildly scummy.  its not worth a lynch though.  <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Llama 421 wrote:</cite>Notice how Prawn immediately dismissed (again) my push on him by saying that only I saw things as scummy.

I don\u2019t know what Llama was expecting Prawn to respond to.  it might just be scummy rabblerousing.  This is an example of a trumped up case that Prawn\u2019s talking about.<br><br>ok, what is sheeping?<br><br>-=-<br><br>So yeah, it looks like Llama really IS trumped up case toting and very bandwagony.  He omgus'd Tripod, and i think the only reason we heard anything about GIF was because i was hounding him about it.  Then he omgus'd Prawn, and we've heard nothing about either GIF nor Tripod ever since.  it really does seem like he's just voting for who he can rather than who he suspects.  <br><br>After a response and following argument with Llama, (unless he changes my mind) i'd consider voting for him.<br><br>so, balls in your court llama.

Looking at my role I expected at most two others, and if scum has no roles, I am it.  If it looked right to claim D2 (dead scum, lots of prob town players, result on a player getting votes) I absolutely would have claimed right there.<br><br>The argument for tracking VT that has claimed, especially if I am reading number of scum right, is that if scum (before all this happened) they would be most likely to submit a kill as the player who is already claimed is usually the \"expendable\" one, and just statistically in a two scum setup the chance of getting a \"false positive\" meaning hitting scum who didn't act is low enough to justify a significant town tell.  That and if they are scum with a role, they would be dead in the water.  The fact that UT doesn't understand the strength of a \"no action\" on a VT claim from a tracker is REALLY concerning to me.  Tracking a player who goes nowhere is a little below the lines of a cop clear, especially if there are two scum because there would be literally only one role that generates a false positive in that case.<br><br>Basically assuming a target lives through the night and went nowhere is about 12% more likely to be town than an average player.  As tracker you want to be shooting for a player who should give you a \"went nowhere\" result, what better role to do that then claimed VT?<br><br>In the all, it basically produces two players scum would need to nightkill to get rid of.  Which is going to limit their ability to get rid of whoever they want to each night as priorities emerge<br><br>@onion - You really think Prawn as town makes the onion comment, only says its a reaction test after Equinox and I said he was scum for it.  Then calls Marquis null for lurking and says he would hammer.  Then calls Marquis town after Marquis called Prawn slight town.  Then decided that what he thought Marquis was town for was something that happened multiple pages AFTER Prawn called him town?  He literally changed his reasoning as to why a player was town from a shifty reason to something that doesn't line up with the timeline of the game."}

It looks like LlamaFluff responded \"don't use the shot on Night 1\" to the hypotheticals where 1) VT was lynched on Day 1, 2) PR was lynched on Day 1, and 3) PR (vigilante) claimed but VT was lynched. The flip side of this is that he would only hold back if he knew he was going to survive to do so, so it makes sense here that he would use his shot on Night 1. The other thing is that his reasoning in that thread is pretty similar to what he was saying here about wanting to \"clear\" NJAC's slot for what a \"No Target\" result is worth.<br><br>I think I'm just really, really scared of mislynching LlamaFluff, and that fear is now doubled because he's a claimed tracker. My instinct here is to let him go, but I also hesitate to lynch NJAC because I agree that Marquis's behavior is less indicative of scum. I'll read the thread over again later today; there's something specific I need to look for that should tell me if LlamaFluff is the way to go because ChannelDelibird's <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6648930#p6648930\" class=\"postlink\">post 602</a> is unsettling."}

Typically when someone attacks you, you have to respond. Someone saying you're scum is typically distracting from scum hunting. So yes, \"saving his skin\" when you put a wagon on him for no reason sounds like a logical way to go. But wait, because you put the random wagon on him, he was forced to try and counter it, but apparently that's not what you want. That just means he's scum because he's trying to prevent a mislynch. Silly me. <br><br>So this is your argument:<br>You set llama on fire.<br>He tries to put out the fire.<br>You say he's scum because he's not looking for scum.<br>Well hot damn, that's some round-a-bout logic right there.

You're assuming that scum are going to be later on a wagon, and you're also assuming -- with your \"scum-o-meter\" -- that town are less likely to vote town than scum are. The latter assumption is especially dangerous because, surprise, scummy people get voted. Your conclusion that Derangement might be scum just because Derangement was at or near the top of both lists is also likely to be incorrect, and scum could have just not killed Derangement for other reasons. GuyInFreezer said that he was going to reveal something Today, for instance.<br><br>Anyway, I was going to read prawneater (and LlamaFluff and snscompt1) but didn't because I'm a master procrastinator.

What you claimed to do proves precisely nothing.  It doesn't prove your role, and it doesn't even theoretically clear UT.  The only thing you've proven thus far is that you can cold-read UT which isn't that great of a feat.  It doesn't make sense from a real town tracker, but it makes perfect sense from someone faking it.<br><br>Your logic ties your own shoelaces together and now you're tripping."}

I really could care less if I didn't do the super aggressive track because its more likely to screw town over if I made that move.  Lets say I decided to track player X who has a PR.  Well then I really cant claim anything without outing a role and even then it would only prove role and not alignment.  I made what is to me the right track.  It semi-clears UT and with the way onion (who again, assuming two scum is going to be town) has been playing probably keeps those two away from each other later on.  Not even the whole TTH is trying to undercut the track and say it doesn't have much of anything on how likely UT is to be town.  Then really the \"you should have tried to track a PR\" response, which is the absolute worst role I could track (but it benefits scum quite a bit)."}

As I mentioned before, LlamaFluff's reasoning matches what he said in Mafia Discussion some years ago, which admittedly only tells me that his thought process has been consistent. Again, the last thing I want to do is mislynch LlamaFluff -- been there, done that -- and, having read this most recent spate of interactions, I'm finally getting the sense that this isn't the usual LlamaFluff. This is what bugs me most because I don't understand what to do with that read, as most of my experience with him has been either misreading him as town or not caring because I was scum.<br><br>If I wanted to take the onion route of doing things, lynching LlamaFluff would be an okay thing to do. He's used up his shot, so that's not a reason to keep him around anymore. I'm not writing off his reasons for tracking Untrod Tripod because that is consistent with the LlamaFluff I know, but, now that he tells Derangement in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6671601#p6671601\">post 729</a> that everyone besides his town reads are \"null at best,\" it rubs me the wrong way. LlamaFluff should have gotten a read on me by now.<br><br>Overall, I'm really hesitant to do anything right now because I don't have as great of a grip on this game as I'd like. Having a handful of solid town reads is one thing, but I can really go back and forth on everyone else and the fact that the most helpful thing I can do to fix that is to read the damned thread again is itself the roadblock to clarifying those reads. Having to write a thesis on a relatively short deadline isn't helping, either.<br><br>...that was probably way, way more than what you wanted from me. The tl;dr of it is that it's not the claim with which I take issue right now."}

There'd be 2 paths to take here, the high risk and the low risk.  low risk is fake-tracking someone others have a town-read on, and saying a negative result.  this would make it very hard to disprove the role claim, and improve your longevity.  the high risk route would involve picking someone you want to ace and saying a positive result on them, and trying to get them lynched, and then trying to fight off your own lynch the next day.  which would be dumb but a lot more fun.  people have said stuff about Llama being a conservative player.  <br><br>so to those people:  would Scum!Llama pick the low risk or the high risk route?<br><br>-=-<br><br>drunk me brought up something about Tripod and i really ought to hash that out and figure out if its true or not.  he said <br><br>\"if you flip tracker i'd feel better about tripod, but not as good as i'd feel if you flipped scum, because while tripod might have been scum dodging a tracker result, you ought not be scum with tripod due to your argument early in the game. \"<br><br>so Llama and Tripod ought not both be scum because Tripod L-1'd Llama.  However that statement is muddled by Tripod's known anti-win-con antics, and it seems entirely possible in my mind that scum!tripod would indeed L-1 his scumbuddy because tripod is crazy.  but it can still be a loose implication at least.  if you flip scum i won't stop suspecting Tripod.  having it be you two would be like a nice scumbasket with a ribbon on top.  If you flip tracker, i would actually feel a lot better about Tripod, because he is one of MY major scumreads, and someone I would have considered tracking.  Getting a true negative result on him would make him less scummy.  him l-1ing the tracker wouldn't make him more scummy because he's just crazy like that."}

And this reason is, in and of itself, not based on the lynchee's alignment.  Thus, this is an unobtrusive/universal filler excuse to lynch someone, and onion uses it excessively.

Thus 'this guy will produce lots of info on flip' is a good point to consider when picking who to lynch.  nothing is the ONLY thing to lynch on (well, ya know except for scum-claims and stuff) but it's totally a reason to pick one scummy person over another.  <br><br>3) yes, but its because i hate him.  you'll be happy to know i calmed down about it though, see post 775.<br><br>4) um, the suspicious seats on the bandwagon are the not-first-or-last regardless of the flip.  scum want to lynch townies, so will pile on, and scum want to be on wagons that lynch scum if the wagon is going to happen anyway.  what scum don't want to do is place a first vote on their buddy, then push the case, work it up and finally lynch them, because that's a lot of work that could have been put into lynching a townie instead.  its just self-defeating.  so middle seats are just scummy.  early seats are more scummy on town-wagons and later seats are more scummy on scum-wagons.  maybe the hammer is scummy on scum-wagons i dunno, case by case.<br><br>5) people keep bringing this up and i'm fuzzy on it.  we know there's (at least was) power roles out there, and we can suss out kinda sorta what they ought to be by what we know, and we can use this information to judge people's roleclaims, and that's useful.  i've always assumed that our power roles aren't going to be like 'oh you talking about doctors thats me!' because that would be entirely terrible.  but i don't really get why people consider the discussion of roles without claims to be scummy.  please tell me.<br><br>--) that god damn drunk housemate thing again.  its really truly my drunk housemate.  he's funny because he's dumb, and this time he read the list of names and picked some people.  i posted them so that at the end of the game i'll know if it turned out he was right or not and that'll be funny too.  ITS NOT A BREADCRUMB.<br><br>tldr: because long posts are anti-town without tldrs:  GC is great.  i won't support a lynch on him right now."}

Bad entry into the game.</span>  I'm always a bit iffy in terms of evaluating RVS-stage play, but Llama entered into the game in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6600966#p6600966\">Post 47</a> with one foot decidedly outside of RVS, so I feel comfortable in saying that it was bad and reflective of his alignment.  I really nothing the \"oh and UT\" tag at the end (insofar that I saw the theory that Llama was \"keeping his options open\" or whatever, because it's not alignment indicative to suspect more than one player at one time), as it's the GIF suspicions that bother me in particular.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Why it's alignment indicative:</span> Llama's GIF-suspicions are not actually of alignment-indicative play - any alignment could accept Equinox's theory as valid, but then dispute whether any particular player fell under that theory's umbrella.  It's a technical argument being made early on that doesn't hold up to scrutiny, which suggests that Llama was really stretching to find something scummy about something.  This is particularly true as Llama was selected by the thread to get early D1 pressure to post.  Llama's immediate follow up in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6601518#p6601518\">Post 59</a> confirm this understanding.<br><br>I remain unconvinced by Llama's restatements in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6614790#p6614790\">Post 234</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6615101#p6615101\">Post 237</a>, which read more like Llama having to defend a suspicion he's married to rather than actual belief.  This read of 234 and 237 is because Llama appears to be shifting the goalposts to make his position better:  first it was why didn't GIF do the town thing and question the validity of Equinox's scum pool (a why question), rather than do the scum thing and question why GIF was part of that pool; now it is why didn't GIF do the town thing and just shrug at the scum pool and ignore it, rather than do the scum thing and question Equinox at all (any why question)?<br><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">2.  Inordinate focus on the early D1 L-1.</span>  Who cares?  It's not a big deal.  IF Llama is town AND IF Llama got quick lynched on D1 THEN hammer and setup would (rightly) come under scrutiny.  But that didn't happen, and so UT putting Llama at L-1 in super early D1 is unequivocally worthless alignment discussion.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Why it's alignment indicative:</span>  Llama makes an early D1 L-1 a big deal (when it isn't), and a basis to push UT (when it isn't alignment indicative), which scum would do because it's something easy to push.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Examples:</span> <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6603509#p6603509\">Post 72</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6603542#p6603542\">Post 74</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6603740#p6603740\">Post 77</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6603997#p6603997\">Post 81</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6604640#p6604640\">Post 100</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6604677#p6604677\">Post 105</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6605016#p6605016\">Post 117</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6614790#p6614790\">Post 234</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6616986#p6616986\">Post 259</a>.<br><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">3.

Llama's framing of prawn's position makes it easier for Llama to justify his prawn-vote.  Llama also further warps prawn's position in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6627086#p6627086\">Post 356</a>), focusing on whether prawn's criticism amounts to whether Llama was engaging in \"self-preservation\" (not sure where that term came from, I don't see prawn using it at all), rather than to prawn's actual point:  that Llama didn't appear to be trying to figure out the game and vote accordingly, and instead was simply trying to get the thread's vote momentum thrown onto someone - anyone - else.<br><br>From there on out, Llama goes down a prawn-is-scum rabbit hole.  Admittedly, this possibly suggests a town tunnel, but with the basic setup of the prawn-suspicions as discussed above, Llama trying to throw everything including the kitchen sink at prawn could equally be Llama-scum trying to mimic a town tunnel.<br><br>Also, some of the accusations are just jaw-droppingly desperate material (see <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6637195#p6637195\">Post 438</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6637481#p6637481\">Post 441</a>, and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6637531#p6637531\">Post 442</a>) that I would think Llama-town would take a moment to reflect and evaluate and weed out such accusations, rather than just try to see what sticks.<br><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">4.

Particularly if the power is over on N1, and the result is not really helpful (a no movement operates as a 50% town result if we're assuming 2 person scum group).  His PR claim keeps him alive by the town, and his expenditure of his only night action justifies why he hasn't been killed by the scum.<br><br>As for Llama's convoluted plan of keeping Marquis alive to track Marquis, I don't think that's inherently alignment indicative, though it's sure as shit convoluted.  What bothers me more than the alleged plan, though, is Equinox's observation (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6649943#p6649943\">Post 625</a>) that Llama is well versed in normal roles and has already thought up optimal tracker-town play.  With that in mind, Llama's convoluted plan/theory explanations feels like scum super happy to throw down a textbook of knowledge about why his play is obvtown play (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6648767#p6648767\">Post 599</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6651567#p6651567\">Post 644</a>, and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6651619#p6651619\">Post 650</a>) rather than a more straightforward play/theory that would be subject to typical WIFOM and, thus, not really help Llama-scum much."}

Thus 'this guy will produce lots of info on flip' is a good point to consider when picking who to lynch.  nothing is the ONLY thing to lynch on (well, ya know except for scum-claims and stuff) but it's totally a reason to pick one scummy person over another.  <br><br>3) yes, but its because i hate him.  you'll be happy to know i calmed down about it though, see post 775.<br><br>4) um, the suspicious seats on the bandwagon are the not-first-or-last regardless of the flip.  scum want to lynch townies, so will pile on, and scum want to be on wagons that lynch scum if the wagon is going to happen anyway.  what scum don't want to do is place a first vote on their buddy, then push the case, work it up and finally lynch them, because that's a lot of work that could have been put into lynching a townie instead.  its just self-defeating.  so middle seats are just scummy.  early seats are more scummy on town-wagons and later seats are more scummy on scum-wagons.  maybe the hammer is scummy on scum-wagons i dunno, case by case.<br><br>5) people keep bringing this up and i'm fuzzy on it.  we know there's (at least was) power roles out there, and we can suss out kinda sorta what they ought to be by what we know, and we can use this information to judge people's roleclaims, and that's useful.  i've always assumed that our power roles aren't going to be like 'oh you talking about doctors thats me!' because that would be entirely terrible.  but i don't really get why people consider the discussion of roles without claims to be scummy.  please tell me.<br><br>--) that god damn drunk housemate thing again.  its really truly my drunk housemate.  he's funny because he's dumb, and this time he read the list of names and picked some people.  i posted them so that at the end of the game i'll know if it turned out he was right or not and that'll be funny too.

It's not so much that you habitually long posts.  The problem is that a lot of the content of those posts were either filler (off the top of my head, opining about whether people should do full lists or not), or were so repetitive or convoluted that they actively made it difficult to read.<br><br>2.  I'm skeptical that two people are ever \"equally\" scummy.  In any event, I feel that you used the \"post-flip associative tell\" basis as a main drive to push lynches moreso than alignment-indicative reasons.<br><br>3. Okay.

Emphasizing such a basis to push a vote is what scum would do, because it's easy.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Examples:</span> <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6607523#p6607523\">Post 156</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6618752#p6618752\">Post 275</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6619615#p6619615\">Post 295</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6620950#p6620950\">Post 302</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6629102#p6629102\">Post 372</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6629850#p6629850\">Post 383</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6632246#p6632246\">Post 396</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6645605#p6645605\">Post 549</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6648782#p6648782\">Post 600</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6665858#p6665858\">Post 711</a>.<br><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">3.

This looked like onion had tipped his hand about knowing Llama's (town) alignment.  Rereading, though, I see that in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6609522#p6609522\">Post 180</a>, onion is saying that all slots on any bandwagon (except first and hammer) are suspicious.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Why it's alignment indicative:</span>  I still think this points to a scum perspective, and knowledge about Llama's alignment.  I'm not convinced this universal aspect of the theory in Post 180 really allays my suspicions about onion preemptively suspecting the folks on Llama's bandwagon.  Assuming for the sake of argument that all slots on a town bandwagon are scummy, per onion's theory, that wouldn't hold true for slots on a scum bandwagon.  That is, onion has taken a questionable principle that applies to reviewing <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">town bandwagons</span>, and has preemptively applied it to Llama's bandwagon while also still suspecting Llama.<br><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">5.

I'm not super-excited by GC's coming in and rattling hard on onion and Llama, either - the case posts are impressively put together but I find the Llama stuff relatively unconvincing (accepting that hindsight is involved, obviously), as if GC thinks that all we need is the push of a long and well-formatted post to get us to finally do the things we've been threatening for a while.<br><br>That's part of why GC feels different to me here than he did in my most recent experience of playing with him, as town in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=52&amp;t=58859\" class=\"postlink\">Murder on the Oriental Express</a>.
