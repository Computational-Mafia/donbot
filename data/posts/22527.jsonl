You may not quote private Moderator-supplied information (either real or fabricated) of any kind. Paraphrasing (for role claims, etc.) is acceptable.<br>\n2. There is to be NO personal communication outside of the forum postings unless your role PM specifically allows it. Mafia members may communicate at night and during the confirmation stage.<br>\n3. If you have a role with a Night action your choices are due to me by the posted deadline. If I do not receive your choice via PM or bolded in the quick-topic provided by the posted deadline you will forfeit your actions.<br>\n4. Roles with Night actions will not be able to submit an action on Night 0 (i.e. during the confirmation stage).<br>\n5. Any player with a Night action may instead submit a &#8220;No Action&#8221; PM to let the Mod know that you do not want to perform your expected action that Night phase.<br>\n6. As a general rule you should aim for one post every 48 hours, minimum, to keep the game moving.<br>\n<br>\nVoting, Deadlines, and Player Death:<br>\n1. A simple majority of all living members must agree on one person for a lynch to occur prior to deadline.<br>\n2. Once you have reached a simple majority no further unvoting will change someone&#8217;s fate.<br>\n3. Once a player is lynched the game enters twilight until I post a death scene; all players including the one who was lynched may continue to post during twilight.<br>\n4. Please submit votes as: <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: PlayerName</div> or <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: PlayerName</span>. Votes will NOT be counted if they are not bold! Obvious abbreviations or nicknames will be counted so long as they are unambiguous.<br>\n5. Please submit vote revocations as either <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Unvote: PlayerName</div> or <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Unvote</div>. Unvotes are not necessary before changing votes.<br>\n6. You may <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: No Lynch</div> - a simple majority of these vote types are required to send the game to Night phase without a lynch.<br>\n7. This game will have 3 week deadlines. At deadline, if there is not a simple majority of votes there will be No Lynch.<br>\n<br>\nMiscellaneous/Mechanics:<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#0000FF\">1. Bold, blue text is reserved for the Mod. No invisible/small text is allowed, nor is cryptography.</div></div><br>\n2. If you have an issue/problem with the game, please PM the Mod privately. Do not post issues/complaints in the game thread.<br>\n3. The Mod may make mistakes - please point out any mistakes gently. Mistakes will be corrected where possible, but sometimes mistakes are made that cannot be reversed. These will stand as final to be commiserated over after the game.<br>\n4. Please bold all requests to the Mod so that they don&#8217;t get missed.<br>\n5. Prods of missing players will be issued automatically after 72 hours of no activity or upon request after 48 hours of no activity. A prodded player has 48 hours to respond or risks replacement. A player who has been prodded 3 times is subject to replacement without further notice.<br>\n6. Rule violations will be dealt with according to their severity, up to and including a Modkill.<br>\n7. If you anticipate being unavailable for more than a 48-hour period please post a notice to that effect in the thread. Treat this game as a commitment. Be considerate &#8211; don&#8217;t leave us hanging.<br>\n<br>\nHere is the Role PM for a Vanilla Townie, at least one person has received this PM.<br>\n<br>\nVanilla Townie<br>\nYou are a normal townsperson, trying to make a living and survive this insanity. This means you have no special abilities bar the power to vote. Use it wisely.<br>\nAt no time may you privately communicate with any other player.<br>\nYou win when all threats to the town are dead and at least one member of the town is still alive, whether you survive to the end or not.<br>\nYou can find the game thread here: __________________________<br>\nPlease confirm you have read and understood this PM by sending me a PM back stating your role.

In RVS all you can really look for is who's trying to move things along.  Of course it's somewhat contrived, nearly all page one votes are unless someone claims in their first post or something.  But voting for someone who hasn't even confirmed can't possibly draw a reaction, which makes it especially useless, ergo slightly scummy.<br>\n<br>\nFor Oso's case to be true, then Axxle ignored a potential argument against <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">the player he was actually voting</div> in order to query the actions of two other players, but not vote them.

He then questions me about an apparent inconsistency between my attitude to you and Oso.  IS can tell me he thinks this looks like co-ordinated scum distancing to me all he wants, but he's not going to convince me because I know he's wrong.

Even on page 3, he usually posts long, well-crafted posts.<br>\n- ChaosOmega's post 69 (lol) seems scummy to me. There is slight sheeping and an opening to hop onto two other wagons.<br>\nPage 4<br>\n- McStab's 89 and 90 worry me. He is nothing like his usual self.<br>\nPage 5<br>\n- Echo's post 100 is really scummy and seems opportunistic.

Sharing the same reads as someone does not mean they are the same alignment as you.<br>\nPage 6<br>\n- I don't like 129 by Echo. A vote could be for pressure.<br>\n- 130 sounds like the McStab I know.<br>\n- 138 by Guttersnipe was town, but there was also fluff involved.<br>\n- IS's 143 is the truth.

He then proceeds to attack Psyduck for the same opportunsitic vote as he placed. <br>\n<br>\nGutter's ISO is very much leaning towards theory and not scum hunting. I still think that slip is worth noting. <br>\n<br>\nMy vote on TVK was ignored for a long time which I guess means no one gave enough of a shit about TVK to care.

Which was the exact same argument that IS tried to lynch me with in a previous game. He was scum.

Is there anyone that was my wagon on McStab's wagon now?</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nNo single player.  The Echo-ConfidAnon slot is (and was also on Psyduck fwiw).<br>\n<br>\nI am strongly suspicious of Arugula right now.  TvK was already on my radar for the 'Scummy or town sheep' comment, but I think this is a slam-dunk contradiction:<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Arugula wrote:</cite>Out of IS/Chaos/Tebow, I see Tebow as most likely being scum. IS was wagoned quickly, <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Chaos' attacks and posts seem very genuine</div>, and as IS said, Tebow doesn't seem to care that Chaos is up his ass, which make it look more like Tebow scum than Chaos scum.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Arugula wrote:</cite>You seem oblivious to the fact that Chaos is blatantly buddying you/sheeping you/up your behind or whatever you want to call it. The only things keeping me from voting you are that McStab is scummier and you have posted a decent case against IS.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nArugula is suggesting I'm scum for not suspecting ChaosOmega.  The bolded section in the first quote, though, strongly implies that Chaos looks townish.  As I said in my last post, there is no reasonable town thought process at all behind 'Well Chaos' opinions look very genuine, but Tebow is scummy for thinking the same thing.'  Then the second quote, surely if you think someone is blatantly buddying/sheeping, that's a scum sign?  And how is something a sheep if it's also a genuine-looking attack?  This looks more like a scumbag who has decided that a particular position is advantageous to hold, then come up with the 'reasoning' to support it afterwards.<br>\n<br>\nAlso, the accusations are untrue.  In Arugula's entry wall, he said 'Agreeing with you doesn't make someone town.'  No, but attacking someone who's genuinely scummy is always at least something of a town sign, and at worst <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">agreeing with me does not in itself make someone scummy</div>.  You've alleged that he's sheeping/buddying.  But he hasn't sheeped - he's voted for the same person, but he's made multiple detailed posts of his own forcefully pushing the case against Internet Stranger.  He hasn't buddied either - find me one sentence in Chaos' posts where he either a) Calls me town or b) Says anything along the lines of 'Tebow makes a great point.'  The closest is when IS says I haven't looked at him [CO] critically which Chaos calls bullshit (it is).<br>\n<br>\nAdditionally, note that Arugula's suspicion of Code_X  is caused by Code suspecting his predecessor.  Really, I'm trying to work out if IS and Arugula make more sense as buddies, or with Arugula-scum white knighting IS to get him onside.  <br>\n<br>\nIf IS is town, and it's a big if, I'm almost sure one of Axxle and Echo/Confid will flip scum.  Code_X pointed out that putting someone at L-1 and then bleating about someone else putting them at L-1 is kinda scummy.  I agree.  With Axxle, he hasn't done anything that's particularly actively scummy, but there's nothing there that's especially hard for scum to fake.  Doing the meta on that IS/Smooth Criminal game is probably the biggest towntell there, but my gut says that this could be a scum player playing well.", "time": "Mon Jul 09, 2012 3:47 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=22527&start=200", "forum": "53", "thread": "22527"}

{"number": 233, "id": "4177049", "user": "McStab", "user_id": "6852", "content": "Coming back to L-1, what a pleasant surprise.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n@arugula - welcome to the game, and you're totally correct that my normal meta is \"long, well-crafted posts.\" Until this point, I had decided to try a more brief posting strategy (it's much easier on my time), however I can see that I am coming across as suspicious and/or easy target for scum, so I think I will return to my normal style.<br>\n<br>\nFirst, since this seems to be the most pressing issue, I'll justify my actions:<br>\n<br>\nPost #19 - RVS<br>\nPost #58 - As Code_X said, it was reaction testing. Anyone who doubts this can notice my ever-subtle breadcrumbing of it being a reaction test with my cryptic \"We have people's reactions, too\". If anyone doubts it's veracity, I didn't stick on targeting Axxle because he dealt with the pressure absolutely fine, practically ignoring it. I reckon that a scum player would've had a kneejerk reaction or at least sweated it out a little.<br>\nPost #89 (and subsequent votecount problems) - My arithmetic was legitimately wrong here. I hadn't devoted the necessary time to the game, and as I said, I'm currently in a bunch of games (none of which have only 11 players). I made a mistake, although I can see how that may come across as a lame scum excuse. I would be more disconcerted if you didn't notice the arithmetic mistake though, and you also didn't immediately vote me upon finding it (which would've been what scum would do, looking for any opportunity).<br>\nPost #90 - More broadly based reaction testing. Not sure exactly what I was looking for, but I felt as though scum would either try to use that as an excuse to leap on a wagon or they'd target me vehemently for it.<br>\nPost #130 - I stand by my vote on Psyduck entirely, for those same reasons. The points I raised there are entirely valid. IS claiming does us no good, and a hammer that early does us no good. Sure, the pressure is good for discussion, but given how bloodthirsty I was coming across, it strikes me as a move to get a pro-town player to hammer another town player.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nI'm still quite busy today, so I don't have time to make my post continuing scumreads. I figured I best post this defense while I still have the chance to do so though. I'd ask that no one hammer me until I post my scumreads tomorrow (well, I'd ask no one hammer me at all, but I don't think that's realistic to expect <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\"> ).", "time": "Tue Jul 10, 2012 4:58 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=22527&start=225", "forum": "53", "thread": "22527"}

One, maybe two players who weren't thinking it through might run with it but no one else would.

Tunneling, crap logic, trying to shove that connection at the thread. It went from Chaos is scum for doing it, through Chaos and Tebow are scum to Tebow might be scum because he's 'getting jiggy with it'. It makes a nice circle. If I wasn't so conflicted about what he's doing in relation to what my mind and gut are telling me (they are on opposite sides) I'd be voting him.

Just because it's long and has alot of his views doesn't mean it's pro-town, he provides no logic whatsoever. While the wagon on me is still functional, he is convinced Code_X is town (see post #154). After Code_X defends me and grows skeptical of Guttersnipe, Guttersnipe is targeting him as potential scum - see post #200. This inconsistency is consistent with opportunist scum.<br>\n<br>\nGuttersnipe then briefly switches onto IS, the easiest wagon yet of the day, with the logic of not voting being bad for the town. What a revelation! This logic is superthin, like every other rationale Guttersnipe has had for voting, ever.<br>\n<br>\nOne post later, he switches to ChaosOmega, with, once again, no excuse but saying \"obvscum\".<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nGuttersnipe hasn't contributed any real logic or rationale to this game at all. He's gotten away with it by being super aggressive. Super aggression is a playstyle, not an alignment indicator per se, and his lack of providing any logic or reason with his votes is indicative of not really scumhunting.<br>\n<br>\nLet's get off these dumb IS and Code_X wagons and get on a real wagon, the Guttersnipe wagon.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: Guttersnipe</div>", "time": "Wed Jul 11, 2012 5:14 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=22527&start=325", "forum": "53", "thread": "22527"}

Most of what he's done is this game is yell at IS. I'd call it tunneling except that tunneling implies more substance.<br>\n<br>\nI realised this was a problem when I ISO'd him and discovered that not only did I not have a read (so assumed town), but that I was getting nothing at all from his ISO, which set off the alarm bells.<br>\n<br>\nIt's true that he does pick at people (more in the early game), but nothing really serious - it's just weird criticism. He never goes anywhere with it and in the context of the rest of the game he may as well have said nothing. That's the key point. No matter what he's done so far, it hasn't resulted in anything real. For example he's yelled at IS and TvK about not laying down a vote - like it matters somehow. It seems his plan is to rely on being the arbiter of good protowniness and that he can substitute that for actually killing scum, which in my view only makes sense in light of the key difference between scum and town: scum have nothing to do during the day since they already know who the scum are, so scumhunting is out of the window and they have to find something else to do.<br>\n<br>\nThe consequence of this, from ChaosOmega, is a clumsy protown/antitown focus, combined with lurking.<br>\n<br>\nBy attacking people for trivial things that in no way could ever lead to a lynch, along with following Tebow around (no one will ever lynch anyone for shadowing somebody) he gets to reduce his attention level down to nothing, since despite his low post count he won't appear to be lurking outright, and his posts, although weighted a little heavily toward self defense, do seem on the face of it to contain something of value. But ultimately he is as divorced from the game as the lurkingest lurker, and so doesn't have to worry about getting caught in any crossfire, or getting screwed by a townie lynch, or anything at all. <br>\n<br>\nLook at his reads for god's sake - it's just a bunch of people who are voting him and McStab, who is the #1 scum in this game. <br>\n<br>\nSo in essense, I'm voting him because none of his behavior has anything to do with killing scum (unless you really think he expects the IS thing to go anywhere,  which I don't, frankly), and too much of it has to do with not being noticed.", "time": "Sun Jul 15, 2012 7:19 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=22527&start=375", "forum": "53", "thread": "22527"}

I have emphatically disproved this argument, I can't understand for the life of me why people are still buying it.  Secondly, that he's somehow tactically lurking.  He's stated that he can only usually post once per day, I don't see how having a limited amount of time to post in thread is scummy.  I see no effort to avoid contributing.  His posts are focused on IS, but that's understandable for someone who thinks IS needs to be lynched.<br>\n<br>\nAs for the wagon, IS may be the most obvious scum of all time.   ConfidAnon, now havingfitz, is a pretty scummy looking slot.  See the 'Fourth vote on IS/Turns on person placing fifth vote on IS' and 'Climbs up IS' backside on entry to the game' arguments I made earlier.  His scummy looking behavior makes more sense if IS is town, though, and I don't think that's likely, so I'm not hugely interested in him atm.  Guttersnipe is making a lot of effort and real arguments, I don't really get a lot of his arguments, but I'm leaning town.  He feels like he's trying to find scumHe also appears to be willing to compromise to get a lynch he's OK with, which I think is townish.  Fate himself is completely null, but I'm still feeling town from Psyduck.  I get a feeling based on meta than when Fate replaces in as scum, he likes to white knight.

Yeah I know, not what you expected I bet. The problem with IS is that he's a problematic kind of person.<br>\n<br>\nYou see, my scum read of IS is completely a gut read. I stand by my earlier statements to the effect that nothing he has done is necessarily scummy. Frustrating, stupid, and pointless, sure, but not scummy. My scum reads of mcstab and chaos are based on reason and evidence, whereas with IS I have nothing. In these circumstances I am required to bend to reason.

There's nothing not town about trying to avoid bad lynches (especially after only four days of play or whatever it was). And I don't think I have ever defended or attempted to justify his behavior. His behavior is terrible. That doesn't make him scum though, and that's the key issue. <br>\n<br>\nI think if we were scumbuddies I would be smart enough either to ignore him (which by the way gives me a good feeling about IS/mcstab, as far as that hypothetical goes) or to not later call him scum in an obvious distancing effort in the face of his eventual lynch, but that's wifom so whatever. <br>\n<br>\nIf anybody could put forward a real argument that refers to his motives instead of how 'protown' this or that is or isn't, I would happily add him to my list of potential D1 lynches, but so far there's been a lot of smoke and no fire so to speak, at least as far as I recall, so despite my feelings I remain convinced that throwing rocks at IS on D1 is a mistake. I resent that my failure to agree with you about IS makes me his scumbuddy. When somebody attacks you with that kind of argument and you know that you're town, despite the dictates of reason it becomes easy to see that person as scum, since only scum would attack town with such perfidy.

I'm guessing you're suggesting I look through them since it's unlikely that anybody else will get wagoned so close to deadline but still...it upsets me that two of my reads are gonna be basically useless by the time I get them finished and posted (assuming lynch today and NK tonight) but I guess that's my fault for not posting sooner.<br>\n<br>\nThese wagon impressions/reads are gonna be in place of any reads for these four in my big post, since I'm taking a lot out of that and putting it here for these people...so don't call me out for ignoring them later because I will just direct you to this post unless any of my opinions change.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: ChoasOmega's wagon impressions/read:</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\">I've been looking through posts from/about CO and I'm not at all convinced he's scum for the reasons some others seem to be. I think there's a good chance that he's just obvtown who has the same opinions as Tebow and has been blasted for heavily buddying a player he considers trustworthy because he has the same reads. I have never thought that parroting by itself is very scummy - if somebody does not have any opinions they consider viable other than those already expressed by somebody else, they can and will usually just express their opinions through agreement with the other person. That's never been a scumtell in my opinion, so if anybody can enlighten any other reasons for ChaosOmega's lynch, I will definitely listen. But I'm not voting him for now because my read on him was going to be pretty null for these exact reasons.</div></div></div><br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: McStab's wagon impressions/read:</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\">This is one I'd be more willing to get behind. I don't like his sarcasm or ironic tone or whatever you'd call it in posts 89 and 130. Also his reasoning in 130 is sound, but comes across as either fencesitting or WIFOM, depending on whether you consider it an actual stance on the issue or just his thoughts. Neither of these points to him being town. Then he starts disappearing for groups of up to 40 posts at a time, in 150 he promises a big catch-up that never comes (unless you count 233 which I don't). If you look at post 130, he actually only looks at <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">his own posts</div> and either responds or just cements his arguments. Repetition is a big scumtell to me; scum have a hard time adapting to new knowledge in a game since they are already more informed about the entire situation. This repetition/ignorance of others' posts comes off as scummy, especially when the one post he does respond to was the one where Arugula talks about his meta. Making him self-aware on that kind of thing isn't usually a godo idea, but in this case he blatantly changed his play after being attacked for not being meta-consistent - another huge scumtell in my opinion. I can't believe this was so easily swept under the carpet, considering he's only posted 3 times since this post. Yes, his posts are getting \"longer and well-crafted,\" but that doesn't change the fact that <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">he changed his play</div></div> based on becoming aware of town-meta, which he was told he was not following. I'm watching Arugula for this same reason, I think this might've even been a scumteam exchange for some in-day help that couldn't be done in their QT. Entirely gut on this point, but it'll be interesting to see more of the interactions between the two.</div></div></div><br>\nAs for the other two, I honestly don't like the squabble between my predecessor and Code_X, and I don't think it did either of them any favors since the argument just seemed ill-founded and ill-fought on both sides. I don't have a good read on him, but I'd like to see some more so I can formulate one soon.<br>\n<br>\nSame for IS: I'm actually wondering if anybody has any specific meta for me to look through on him, since it looks like many are dismissing him on policy. I've personally never played with him before so I'd like to have some linked games to check out and form my own opinions on, rather than relying on on Guttersnipe to keep \"whining\" about him being town.

He's still individually scummy as anything, but I'm really not sure someone who was scum with McStab would make this argument:<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>IndividuallyScummy wrote:</cite>If I was truly just trying to save my own ass as you state, I would have been all over McStab now.

LOOK AT HOW I'M <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">NOT</div> VOTING FOR THIS SCUM!\"  There's some wifom here, but I think the simplest explanation is that IS actually thought it was a good argument, which means he was unaware of McStab's alignment.<br>\n<br>\nFate I'm leaning town on, because he loves to bus when scum and as I said I get the impression he likes to white knight town players as well.  So his town read on McStab was probably genuine.

Kind of like your reply to Chaos' same question where you state you didn't realize you were putting McStab at L-1. Regarding your comments about people thinking there are 3 scum in this game...I have to agree with you. I've only been in one other 11 person game that I can find and it had 2 scum. 3 scum in an 11 person game (with or without a rolecop) would be a bit heavy in scum's favor.<br>\n<br>\nI think someone else made a similar comment to this (not sure who) but I think the odds favor McStab's teammate/s not bussing him. Especially if it's a 2 scum game and the scum that would be being bussed is a rolecop.

Make a case.<br>\n<br>\nBecause I've taken quite a hard look at Arugula across the site, and he seems to me to be getting toward VI territory.  He always has poor logic etc, manages to come across as dishonest and opportunistic in everything he does.<br>\n<br>\nBUT<br>\n<br>\nIn this game, he based his early game play around two strong town reads.

It sounded like you would be fine lynching whichever was easiest - you even backed it up by saying you'd settle for a Fate lynch just because he's being obnoxious and you wanted to shut him up...if you lynch somebody it should be for valid reason, otherwise it's random and completely anti-town. </div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Questions for Maestro</div>....<br>\n<br>\n1) Do you think this game is a 8-2-1 or a 7-3-1 setup? <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">8-2-1 just seems more likely, IMO.

In this setup we would have 2 mislynches still available to us and worst case (neither Fate or IS being scum) we would still have a 3 person LYLO for town to find scum in. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">I don't understand the relevance of counting possible mislynches if you're just asking me this question. Are you trying to influence my opinion? It's just odd. Also, I wouldn't completely rule out scum bussing D1 but if it did actually happen it's kindof ridiculous to expect the scum-busser to be one of the \"wait-and-watch type\" bussers. Scum would have to be pretty dedicated to buss their PR partner D1, so I think they were either spearheading for McStab or they weren't even on his wagon.</div><br>\n<br>\n3) <div style=\"display:inline-flex;text-decoration:line-through\">If you think it is an 7-3-1 setup...do you really think BOTH of McStab's remaining partners were on his lynch?

In this set up we could even be looking at a Fate AND IS remaining team.</div> <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Like I said, I don't find this likely...but IS's comment about the possibility of him and Fate both being scum was strange. Maybe he could clarify the point of it. <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">P-Edit: I reread it and I understand now. @IS: do you think havingfitz is tunneling you and trying to associate the two of you to line up lynches?</div></div><br>\n<br>\nWith both Fate and IS being off the McStab wagon...there is no way either of them should be in LYLO. Even if they both happen to be town we still need to get rid of them before LYLO. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">I agree with this wholeheartedly if you're saying that they wouldn't help town in LyLo...if you're just saying lynch them on policy...that's not a very pro-town thing to say at all.
