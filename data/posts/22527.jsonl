You may not quote private Moderator-supplied information (either real or fabricated) of any kind. Paraphrasing (for role claims, etc.) is acceptable.<br>2. There is to be NO personal communication outside of the forum postings unless your role PM specifically allows it. Mafia members may communicate at night and during the confirmation stage.<br>3. If you have a role with a Night action your choices are due to me by the posted deadline. If I do not receive your choice via PM or bolded in the quick-topic provided by the posted deadline you will forfeit your actions.<br>4. Roles with Night actions will not be able to submit an action on Night 0 (i.e. during the confirmation stage).<br>5. Any player with a Night action may instead submit a \u201cNo Action\u201d PM to let the Mod know that you do not want to perform your expected action that Night phase.<br>6. As a general rule you should aim for one post every 48 hours, minimum, to keep the game moving.<br><br>Voting, Deadlines, and Player Death:<br>1. A simple majority of all living members must agree on one person for a lynch to occur prior to deadline.<br>2. Once you have reached a simple majority no further unvoting will change someone\u2019s fate.<br>3. Once a player is lynched the game enters twilight until I post a death scene; all players including the one who was lynched may continue to post during twilight.<br>4. Please submit votes as: <span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: PlayerName</span> or <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: PlayerName</span>. Votes will NOT be counted if they are not bold! Obvious abbreviations or nicknames will be counted so long as they are unambiguous.<br>5. Please submit vote revocations as either <span class=\"noboldsig\">Unvote: PlayerName</span> or <span class=\"noboldsig\">Unvote</span>. Unvotes are not necessary before changing votes.<br>6. You may <span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: No Lynch</span> - a simple majority of these vote types are required to send the game to Night phase without a lynch.<br>7. This game will have 3 week deadlines. At deadline, if there is not a simple majority of votes there will be No Lynch.<br><br>Miscellaneous/Mechanics:<br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #0000FF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">1. Bold, blue text is reserved for the Mod. No invisible/small text is allowed, nor is cryptography.</span></span></span><br>2. If you have an issue/problem with the game, please PM the Mod privately. Do not post issues/complaints in the game thread.<br>3. The Mod may make mistakes - please point out any mistakes gently. Mistakes will be corrected where possible, but sometimes mistakes are made that cannot be reversed. These will stand as final to be commiserated over after the game.<br>4. Please bold all requests to the Mod so that they don\u2019t get missed.<br>5. Prods of missing players will be issued automatically after 72 hours of no activity or upon request after 48 hours of no activity. A prodded player has 48 hours to respond or risks replacement. A player who has been prodded 3 times is subject to replacement without further notice.<br>6. Rule violations will be dealt with according to their severity, up to and including a Modkill.<br>7. If you anticipate being unavailable for more than a 48-hour period please post a notice to that effect in the thread. Treat this game as a commitment. Be considerate \u2013 don\u2019t leave us hanging.<br><br>Here is the Role PM for a Vanilla Townie, at least one person has received this PM.<br><br>Vanilla Townie<br>You are a normal townsperson, trying to make a living and survive this insanity. This means you have no special abilities bar the power to vote. Use it wisely.<br>At no time may you privately communicate with any other player.<br>You win when all threats to the town are dead and at least one member of the town is still alive, whether you survive to the end or not.<br>You can find the game thread here: __________________________<br>Please confirm you have read and understood this PM by sending me a PM back stating your role.

Then he votes IS, and there's a good case against IS, so that isn't scummy.

He always posts long, well-thought out posts and never really any short, choppy ones.<br>Page 2<br>- I like Tebow's post 45. Seems town.<br>- I like Oso's post 46. Also seems town, despite the strange, slightly scummy entrance.<br>Page 3<br>- Oso's post 50 also looks town.<br>- McStab's post 58 is VERY unlike him. Even on page 3, he usually posts long, well-crafted posts.<br>- ChaosOmega's post 69 (lol) seems scummy to me. There is slight sheeping and an opening to hop onto two other wagons.<br>Page 4<br>- McStab's 89 and 90 worry me. He is nothing like his usual self.<br>Page 5<br>- Echo's post 100 is really scummy and seems opportunistic. (Why the spoiler?)<br>- Post 103 by Psyduck...smh...L-1 already? <br>- I like 104 by InternetStranger.<br>- 110 by Axxle is town.<br>- 123 by Tebow is scummy. Sharing the same reads as someone does not mean they are the same alignment as you.<br>Page 6<br>- I don't like 129 by Echo.

Tebow's <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4154051#p4154051\">67</a> I tend to agree that lurking IS has allowed himself to avoid suspicion.<br><br>Don't like <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4154979#p4154979\">75</a>. I don't particularly see CO's vote as opportunism. Nor does Tebow's play look similar to that scum in the other game. He was buddying/sheeping everyone.

Considering he said previously that CO's vote on IS was an opportune moment to join the wagon. I'd need to check up on McStab's meta but I think he's town. The fact he's pretty careless with his votes strikes me as a good thing. Gutter posts theory in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4157751#p4157751\">91</a> - ignores pretty much every thing since he last posted.<br><br>Echo's <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4158606#p4158606\">100</a> is scummy. Not just necessarily his vote on IS - which I believe was -2 and does seem opportunistic and scummy more so the fact he's throwing barbs at Psyduck's vote on Omega. <br>Pretty sure there was reasoning. He already stated prior to the actual vote a reason for voting CO.<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4158606#p4158606\" class=\"postlink\">post 100</a>, Echo wrote:</cite>Psyduck is complaining about those complaining about RVS and places a vote with no reasoning. I don't want that missed.</div></blockquote><br><br>IS says two scum on his wagon. Ignores Echo's vote which I find scummier than Psyduck's vote. I don't like Oso's attack at Chaos in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4159565#p4159565\">107</a> especially with IS at lynch-1. <br><br>Over-reaction much?

You can't know for sure someone else won't go rogue and hammer.

I don't mind him moving his vote. I just don't like his reasons for voting Duck. TVK pops in 132 and again pings out at Psyduck. Like Echo's vote on IS is the scummy one. Psyduck knew he'd get loads of attention for sticking IS at lynch -1. I highly doubt he'd be so blase as scum. I may be wrong - but it feels town and it feels like those attacking him are either newbs/scummy. So FOS's for McStab, Echo and TVK.<br><br>I agree with a lot of <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4161533#p4161533\">134</a> from Omega. Gutter's post again doesn't comment on much more so seems to advocate ignoring IS and then slings muck at McStab. IS appears again and yet again contributes shit all but tunnelling against Omega. It's banal IS.

Is there anyone that was my wagon on McStab's wagon now?</div></blockquote><br><br>No single player.  The Echo-ConfidAnon slot is (and was also on Psyduck fwiw).<br><br>I am strongly suspicious of Arugula right now.  TvK was already on my radar for the 'Scummy or town sheep' comment, but I think this is a slam-dunk contradiction:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Arugula wrote:</cite>Out of IS/Chaos/Tebow, I see Tebow as most likely being scum. IS was wagoned quickly, <span class=\"noboldsig\">Chaos' attacks and posts seem very genuine</span>, and as IS said, Tebow doesn't seem to care that Chaos is up his ass, which make it look more like Tebow scum than Chaos scum.</div></blockquote><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Arugula wrote:</cite>You seem oblivious to the fact that Chaos is blatantly buddying you/sheeping you/up your behind or whatever you want to call it. The only things keeping me from voting you are that McStab is scummier and you have posted a decent case against IS.</div></blockquote><br><br>Arugula is suggesting I'm scum for not suspecting ChaosOmega.  The bolded section in the first quote, though, strongly implies that Chaos looks townish.  As I said in my last post, there is no reasonable town thought process at all behind 'Well Chaos' opinions look very genuine, but Tebow is scummy for thinking the same thing.'  Then the second quote, surely if you think someone is blatantly buddying/sheeping, that's a scum sign?  And how is something a sheep if it's also a genuine-looking attack?  This looks more like a scumbag who has decided that a particular position is advantageous to hold, then come up with the 'reasoning' to support it afterwards.<br><br>Also, the accusations are untrue.  In Arugula's entry wall, he said 'Agreeing with you doesn't make someone town.'  No, but attacking someone who's genuinely scummy is always at least something of a town sign, and at worst <span style=\"font-style: italic\">agreeing with me does not in itself make someone scummy</span>.  You've alleged that he's sheeping/buddying.  But he hasn't sheeped - he's voted for the same person, but he's made multiple detailed posts of his own forcefully pushing the case against Internet Stranger.  He hasn't buddied either - find me one sentence in Chaos' posts where he either a) Calls me town or b) Says anything along the lines of 'Tebow makes a great point.'  The closest is when IS says I haven't looked at him [CO] critically which Chaos calls bullshit (it is).<br><br>Additionally, note that Arugula's suspicion of Code_X  is caused by Code suspecting his predecessor.  Really, I'm trying to work out if IS and Arugula make more sense as buddies, or with Arugula-scum white knighting IS to get him onside.  <br><br>If IS is town, and it's a big if, I'm almost sure one of Axxle and Echo/Confid will flip scum.  Code_X pointed out that putting someone at L-1 and then bleating about someone else putting them at L-1 is kinda scummy.  I agree.  With Axxle, he hasn't done anything that's particularly actively scummy, but there's nothing there that's especially hard for scum to fake.  Doing the meta on that IS/Smooth Criminal game is probably the biggest towntell there, but my gut says that this could be a scum player playing well."}

Anyone who doubts this can notice my ever-subtle breadcrumbing of it being a reaction test with my cryptic \"We have people's reactions, too\". If anyone doubts it's veracity, I didn't stick on targeting Axxle because he dealt with the pressure absolutely fine, practically ignoring it. I reckon that a scum player would've had a kneejerk reaction or at least sweated it out a little.<br>Post #89 (and subsequent votecount problems) - My arithmetic was legitimately wrong here. I hadn't devoted the necessary time to the game, and as I said, I'm currently in a bunch of games (none of which have only 11 players). I made a mistake, although I can see how that may come across as a lame scum excuse. I would be more disconcerted if you didn't notice the arithmetic mistake though, and you also didn't immediately vote me upon finding it (which would've been what scum would do, looking for any opportunity).<br>Post #90 - More broadly based reaction testing. Not sure exactly what I was looking for, but I felt as though scum would either try to use that as an excuse to leap on a wagon or they'd target me vehemently for it.<br>Post #130 - I stand by my vote on Psyduck entirely, for those same reasons. The points I raised there are entirely valid. IS claiming does us no good, and a hammer that early does us no good. Sure, the pressure is good for discussion, but given how bloodthirsty I was coming across, it strikes me as a move to get a pro-town player to hammer another town player.<br><br><br>I'm still quite busy today, so I don't have time to make my post continuing scumreads. I figured I best post this defense while I still have the chance to do so though. I'd ask that no one hammer me until I post my scumreads tomorrow (well, I'd ask no one hammer me at all, but I don't think that's realistic to expect <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\"> )."}

One, maybe two players who weren't thinking it through might run with it but no one else would.

Tunneling, crap logic, trying to shove that connection at the thread. It went from Chaos is scum for doing it, through Chaos and Tebow are scum to Tebow might be scum because he's 'getting jiggy with it'. It makes a nice circle. If I wasn't so conflicted about what he's doing in relation to what my mind and gut are telling me (they are on opposite sides) I'd be voting him.

He should place a vote though, as Tebow pointed out it's hard for us to get a good sense of his strong opinions. I still doubt he's scum, but it would be far more helpful to the town if he'd put a vote down.<br><br>Code_X is obv. town, and anyone who says otherwise really needs to reread his ISO. He's got the most content-filled posts, he's changed his vote based on who appears scummiest to him at the time (not the best wagon at any given time) and he's nitpicky. THESE ARE TOWN TRAITS.<br><br>Chaos and Tebow combined are a weird issue. I am getting town vibes from both, but I am uncomfortable with their lack of criticism or even skepticism of each other's alignment. I doubt that both are scum, but I implore each of them to not let the other one buddy up to them so blatantly.Something is amiss here if you ask me.<br><br>Guttersnipe is the scummiest target today imo. Do an ISO on him, his excuses to change votes onto opportunistic targets is laughable. He went after me with virtually no evidence - seriously, his big \"evidence\" post #148 is absolutely useless. No rationale or evidence given. Yet he gets a free by on this post by just about everyone? Just because it's long and has alot of his views doesn't mean it's pro-town, he provides no logic whatsoever. While the wagon on me is still functional, he is convinced Code_X is town (see post #154). After Code_X defends me and grows skeptical of Guttersnipe, Guttersnipe is targeting him as potential scum - see post #200. This inconsistency is consistent with opportunist scum.<br><br>Guttersnipe then briefly switches onto IS, the easiest wagon yet of the day, with the logic of not voting being bad for the town. What a revelation! This logic is superthin, like every other rationale Guttersnipe has had for voting, ever.<br><br>One post later, he switches to ChaosOmega, with, once again, no excuse but saying \"obvscum\".<br><br><br>Guttersnipe hasn't contributed any real logic or rationale to this game at all. He's gotten away with it by being super aggressive. Super aggression is a playstyle, not an alignment indicator per se, and his lack of providing any logic or reason with his votes is indicative of not really scumhunting.<br><br>Let's get off these dumb IS and Code_X wagons and get on a real wagon, the Guttersnipe wagon.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: Guttersnipe</span>"}

Most of what he's done is this game is yell at IS. I'd call it tunneling except that tunneling implies more substance.<br><br>I realised this was a problem when I ISO'd him and discovered that not only did I not have a read (so assumed town), but that I was getting nothing at all from his ISO, which set off the alarm bells.<br><br>It's true that he does pick at people (more in the early game), but nothing really serious - it's just weird criticism. He never goes anywhere with it and in the context of the rest of the game he may as well have said nothing. That's the key point. No matter what he's done so far, it hasn't resulted in anything real. For example he's yelled at IS and TvK about not laying down a vote - like it matters somehow. It seems his plan is to rely on being the arbiter of good protowniness and that he can substitute that for actually killing scum, which in my view only makes sense in light of the key difference between scum and town: scum have nothing to do during the day since they already know who the scum are, so scumhunting is out of the window and they have to find something else to do.<br><br>The consequence of this, from ChaosOmega, is a clumsy protown/antitown focus, combined with lurking.<br><br>By attacking people for trivial things that in no way could ever lead to a lynch, along with following Tebow around (no one will ever lynch anyone for shadowing somebody) he gets to reduce his attention level down to nothing, since despite his low post count he won't appear to be lurking outright, and his posts, although weighted a little heavily toward self defense, do seem on the face of it to contain something of value. But ultimately he is as divorced from the game as the lurkingest lurker, and so doesn't have to worry about getting caught in any crossfire, or getting screwed by a townie lynch, or anything at all. <br><br>Look at his reads for god's sake - it's just a bunch of people who are voting him and McStab, who is the #1 scum in this game. <br><br>So in essense, I'm voting him because none of his behavior has anything to do with killing scum (unless you really think he expects the IS thing to go anywhere,  which I don't, frankly), and too much of it has to do with not being noticed."}

I have emphatically disproved this argument, I can't understand for the life of me why people are still buying it.  Secondly, that he's somehow tactically lurking.  He's stated that he can only usually post once per day, I don't see how having a limited amount of time to post in thread is scummy.  I see no effort to avoid contributing.  His posts are focused on IS, but that's understandable for someone who thinks IS needs to be lynched.<br><br>As for the wagon, IS may be the most obvious scum of all time.   ConfidAnon, now havingfitz, is a pretty scummy looking slot.  See the 'Fourth vote on IS/Turns on person placing fifth vote on IS' and 'Climbs up IS' backside on entry to the game' arguments I made earlier.  His scummy looking behavior makes more sense if IS is town, though, and I don't think that's likely, so I'm not hugely interested in him atm.  Guttersnipe is making a lot of effort and real arguments, I don't really get a lot of his arguments, but I'm leaning town.  He feels like he's trying to find scumHe also appears to be willing to compromise to get a lynch he's OK with, which I think is townish.  Fate himself is completely null, but I'm still feeling town from Psyduck.  I get a feeling based on meta than when Fate replaces in as scum, he likes to white knight.

It's true that I have been critical of the wagon, when there was a wagon, and that I remain critical of your reasons for suspecting him, but I don't see how that makes me not town. There's nothing not town about trying to avoid bad lynches (especially after only four days of play or whatever it was). And I don't think I have ever defended or attempted to justify his behavior. His behavior is terrible. That doesn't make him scum though, and that's the key issue. <br><br>I think if we were scumbuddies I would be smart enough either to ignore him (which by the way gives me a good feeling about IS/mcstab, as far as that hypothetical goes) or to not later call him scum in an obvious distancing effort in the face of his eventual lynch, but that's wifom so whatever. <br><br>If anybody could put forward a real argument that refers to his motives instead of how 'protown' this or that is or isn't, I would happily add him to my list of potential D1 lynches, but so far there's been a lot of smoke and no fire so to speak, at least as far as I recall, so despite my feelings I remain convinced that throwing rocks at IS on D1 is a mistake. I resent that my failure to agree with you about IS makes me his scumbuddy. When somebody attacks you with that kind of argument and you know that you're town, despite the dictates of reason it becomes easy to see that person as scum, since only scum would attack town with such perfidy. I know how this works because I've been on both sides of it before. This is pretty much the main reason I've wanted to avoid having anything to do with IS today: I know he has this influence."}

I have never thought that parroting by itself is very scummy - if somebody does not have any opinions they consider viable other than those already expressed by somebody else, they can and will usually just express their opinions through agreement with the other person. That's never been a scumtell in my opinion, so if anybody can enlighten any other reasons for ChaosOmega's lynch, I will definitely listen.

I don't like his sarcasm or ironic tone or whatever you'd call it in posts 89 and 130. Also his reasoning in 130 is sound, but comes across as either fencesitting or WIFOM, depending on whether you consider it an actual stance on the issue or just his thoughts. Neither of these points to him being town. Then he starts disappearing for groups of up to 40 posts at a time, in 150 he promises a big catch-up that never comes (unless you count 233 which I don't). If you look at post 130, he actually only looks at <span class=\"noboldsig\">his own posts</span> and either responds or just cements his arguments. Repetition is a big scumtell to me; scum have a hard time adapting to new knowledge in a game since they are already more informed about the entire situation. This repetition/ignorance of others' posts comes off as scummy, especially when the one post he does respond to was the one where Arugula talks about his meta. Making him self-aware on that kind of thing isn't usually a godo idea, but in this case he blatantly changed his play after being attacked for not being meta-consistent - another huge scumtell in my opinion. I can't believe this was so easily swept under the carpet, considering he's only posted 3 times since this post. Yes, his posts are getting \"longer and well-crafted,\" but that doesn't change the fact that <span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">he changed his play</span></span> based on becoming aware of town-meta, which he was told he was not following. I'm watching Arugula for this same reason, I think this might've even been a scumteam exchange for some in-day help that couldn't be done in their QT. Entirely gut on this point, but it'll be interesting to see more of the interactions between the two.</div></div></div><br>As for the other two, I honestly don't like the squabble between my predecessor and Code_X, and I don't think it did either of them any favors since the argument just seemed ill-founded and ill-fought on both sides. I don't have a good read on him, but I'd like to see some more so I can formulate one soon.<br><br>Same for IS: I'm actually wondering if anybody has any specific meta for me to look through on him, since it looks like many are dismissing him on policy. I've personally never played with him before so I'd like to have some linked games to check out and form my own opinions on, rather than relying on on Guttersnipe to keep \"whining\" about him being town.

If anyone (and judging from most of your posts, at least a few of you think I fit this criteria) was bloodthirsty enough to hammer, it could cause a mislynch that easily lets Psyduck shift the blame towards the hammerer. Alternatively it could also force a PR to claim early in panic, which is also bad.</div></blockquote><br><blockquote><div><cite>McStab wrote:</cite>I stand by my vote on Psyduck entirely, for those same reasons. The points I raised there are entirely valid. IS claiming does us no good, and a hammer that early does us no good. Sure, the pressure is good for discussion, but given how bloodthirsty I was coming across, it strikes me as a move to get a pro-town player to hammer another town player.</div></blockquote><br><br>Hmm, should I vote for the guy that scum kept saying was town and tried to derail his wagon previously, or the guy who scum only mentions in the same breath as a crappy attack for putting someone at L-1?"}

Make a case.<br><br>Because I've taken quite a hard look at Arugula across the site, and he seems to me to be getting toward VI territory.  He always has poor logic etc, manages to come across as dishonest and opportunistic in everything he does.<br><br>BUT<br><br>In this game, he based his early game play around two strong town reads.  Both of whom, with McStab flipping scum, would be actual town players.  Ruling out people like that is dangerous for scum.<br><br>Plus, he played consistently with his claimed reads.  Day one, he was pushing Code_X most of the day, based on an original argument that no-one had raised before, albeit one which kinda reads omgus, and had a certain sense to it: Code_X pushing a player for acting in a way Code knew was consistent with his town meta.  So he pushes that first, but in keeping with his Chaos town read, he compromises to lynch scum.  He could very easily have played the tunneled derptown and let Chaos die, but he didn't.

More accurately, I just don't like his current attitude in this game. It's definitely not pro-town. If he is even town, then he's either bloodthirsty or overly-fedup town or some combination. If he's scum he's heavily dosing us with some AtE.</span><br><br>Your assessment of IS confirms your suspicions towards Fate and indicates you might have suspicions towards IS? <span class=\"noboldsig\">Nope, not really.

If so, I'll look it through but I don't know what I'll find.</span><br><br>You suspect me for suspecting both Fate and IS...both of whom you appear to suspect. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif\" alt=\":?\" title=\"Confused\"> <span class=\"noboldsig\">I found you iffy because of the way you stated your views on the competing wagons. It sounded like you would be fine lynching whichever was easiest - you even backed it up by saying you'd settle for a Fate lynch just because he's being obnoxious and you wanted to shut him up...if you lynch somebody it should be for valid reason, otherwise it's random and completely anti-town. </span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Questions for Maestro</span>....<br><br>1) Do you think this game is a 8-2-1 or a 7-3-1 setup? <span class=\"noboldsig\">8-2-1 just seems more likely, IMO. I don't exactly know the chances of either setup but the option with less scum would be more balanced so I'd lean that way.</span><br><br>2) If you think it is an 8-2-1 setup....do you think the odds are for or against McStab's remaining scum partner being on his lynch...when there were viable alternatives (Chaos and Code)? In this setup we would have 2 mislynches still available to us and worst case (neither Fate or IS being scum) we would still have a 3 person LYLO for town to find scum in. <span class=\"noboldsig\">I don't understand the relevance of counting possible mislynches if you're just asking me this question. Are you trying to influence my opinion? It's just odd. Also, I wouldn't completely rule out scum bussing D1 but if it did actually happen it's kindof ridiculous to expect the scum-busser to be one of the \"wait-and-watch type\" bussers. Scum would have to be pretty dedicated to buss their PR partner D1, so I think they were either spearheading for McStab or they weren't even on his wagon.</span><br><br>3) <strike>If you think it is an 7-3-1 setup...do you really think BOTH of McStab's remaining partners were on his lynch? If the answer is no...then we have a 50-50 chance of hitting scum between Fate and IS (hence my I do not care which one we lynch philosophy). Even if we choose between Fate and IS and get it wrong today, after getting it right tomorrow we would still have a 3 person LYLO for town to find scum in. In this set up we could even be looking at a Fate AND IS remaining team.</strike> <span class=\"noboldsig\">Like I said, I don't find this likely...but IS's comment about the possibility of him and Fate both being scum was strange. Maybe he could clarify the point of it. <span style=\"font-style: italic\">P-Edit: I reread it and I understand now. @IS: do you think havingfitz is tunneling you and trying to associate the two of you to line up lynches?</span></span><br><br>With both Fate and IS being off the McStab wagon...there is no way either of them should be in LYLO. Even if they both happen to be town we still need to get rid of them before LYLO. <span class=\"noboldsig\">I agree with this wholeheartedly if you're saying that they wouldn't help town in LyLo...if you're just saying lynch them on policy...that's not a very pro-town thing to say at all. Clarify which you meant please.</span><br><br>4) Why aren't you voting anyone? <span class=\"noboldsig\">Because I don't know who to vote for yet, and it seems like Tebow and I are going to have to think our votes through more carefully since the rest of you have left this in a stalemate.</span></div></blockquote><br><br>It looks like Fate could answer the P-Edit to #3:<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4226742#p4226742\" class=\"postlink\">post 691</a>, Fate wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4226594#p4226594\" class=\"postlink\">post 688</a>, havingfitz wrote:</cite>Fate...why aren't you voting IS?

I want to see where <span class=\"noboldsig\">everybody</span> stands since some of us are moving forward based on an 8-2-1 and some of us are thinking 7-3-1. These are directed mainly at IS, Fate, and havingfitz. Tebow, I think I pretty much know where you stand since we're both in the same boat here, Aru and Chaos can respond if you want since I really don't know what you two are thinking right now other than what I can tell from your vote.<br><br>1. Which setup do you think was used? 8-2-1 or 7-3-1.<br>2. Who do you think are the most likely scumteam members at this point? (3 names or 2 depending on your answer to #1)<br>3. Do you or do you not think scum bussed McStab D1? <br>If the answer is yes, who do you think the busser(s) was? (1 or 2 names depending on your answer to #1)<br><br>I think if we all get our answers to these out in the open then it'll be a lot easier and less confusing (at least for me) to move forward, and it really doesn't look like anybody else has a better idea since we've been stuck in a deadlock for the whole day. Ok?!"}

Axxle flips, and Fate presumably has no idea that his RB even did anything, since there was zero knowledge at the time we were dealing with multiple killing groups. Suggesting that Fate knew he RB'd a kill from targeting Arugula and attacked him because of it is complete bullshit, and if you want to keep pushing that angle, all it shows is that you're not really trying to scumhunt.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Internet Stranger wrote:</cite>Fitz is either deluded or scum.<br><br>Chaos behavior is indicative of opportunisticv scum sitting in the shadows and letting fitz be his stooge.<br><br>Maestro is playing too much like a confused townie.<br><br>Arugula I actually believe in, but if he is secondary scum partner that Fate actually roleblocked, then we are screwed anyways.</div></blockquote><br>So now you have a town read on Arugula?

And ok, so you have a town read on Maestro...<br><blockquote><div><cite>Internet Stranger wrote:</cite>I still say that our best bet is with a Maestro scum.</div></blockquote><br>Holy balls.
