Do not use my color (#49007e).<br>2. If you believe a mod error has been made or you disagree with any action I took, please PM me immediately.<br>3. Once you are dead, you are permitted to make a single \"Bah\" post. Do not influence the game in any way with this post.<br>4. Do not play against the spirit of the rules or of the game.<br>5. This ruleset is subject to change at any time. If a change is made mid-game, it will be announced in-thread by the mod.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Voting and Deadline Rules:</span><br><br>1. Votes should be made using bolded text (<span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: Player</span>) or a vote tag (<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Player</span>). You can also vote for no lynch.<br>2. A lynch (or no lynch) occurs when a simple majority is reached. If deadline is reached without a simple majority, a no lynch occurs.<br>3. All days have a deadline of 14 days, sometimes. Things happen, and extensions will be made in rare circumstances.<br>4. Each night will end after 48 hours and no sooner. The countdown for a night deadline will not start while a replacement is being sought out.<br>5. All night actions must be submitted by PM or a relevant private topic. I greatly prefer PM.<br>6. In the case of five consecutive phases with no deaths, all factions who have not yet achieved their win condition lose.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Activity Rules:</span><br><br>1. A prod PM will be issued if any player does not post for 48 hours. Prods will be announced in-thread. You have 24 hours to pick up your prod either by posting or PM (if at night). After this time, I will begin seeking a replacement.<br>2. I will seek replacement immediately without waiting 24 hours if a player receives a third prod or more.<br>3. If you plan to be gone for over 48 hours, please announce that you will be V/LA in-thread (or by PM, if at night).<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Sample Win Conditions:</span><br><br>You know the following win conditions are present in the game:</span></span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: green\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">You win when all threats have been eliminated and there is at least one town-aligned player alive.</span></span><br><br><span style=\"color: red\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">You win when members of your faction make up half or more of the living players.</span></span></span>"}

Why not contribute to the game with your answers?<br></div></blockquote><br>I don't really see it as a contribution until I'm convinced that they're useful but I don't have a problem with humoring you (I sort of find it weird that Zoronos explicitly does? not scummy weird but etc and at least they did explain why to some extent)<br>1) I historically have preferred town but was actually somewhat hoping to draw scum this game because I believe I haven't played a game on mafiascum as bona fide mafia in 2.5 years. Which is ridiculous. 1 game as a traitor in that timespan. And I can say this more openly now since this is the only game I'm in :p.<br>2) I've been mislynched *mostly* in games that I shouldn't have signed up for in the first place because of not having the time for them, although there was another recent game I played which was the first game I can recall in a long time where I was mislynched and really felt like I shouldn't have been.<br>3) I don't have a playstyle beyond doing what I feel like doing at the time.<br>4) Not enough information (although it's ironic that they're both on my scumread list right now).<br>5) I've learned not to really be excited for games per se because how much I enjoy games is largely a product of factors that can't be predicted at the start of a game.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Grendel wrote:</cite>I'm interested why you find my entrance poitenally scummy when you feel Zoronos is legitimately scummy. If you thought that Zorones was implying I'm scum then why was your initial reaction to my post, \"well that's kinda scummy\"? Sorry, but its weird that you'd have me as a tertiary scum read while your top scum is, in your opinion, also scum reading me. If you think he is scum, why do you think I am scum too?</div></blockquote><br>It's really quite simple. I essentially pay 0 heed on d1 to interactions without flips. Why can't I find you both individually scummy? And further why couldn't I suspect you both of being scum together with Zoronos bussing you? I really don't see what you're getting at or why it's strange to be scumreading both of you.<br><br>Agreed with eager that nn is probably town. Although I wouldn't go so far as to say that nn can only be scum if they're an alt; that's a bit premature, there can be good players who haven't played on MS before.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Zoronos wrote:</cite>This is a decently analytical thought though for this point in the game. ++towniness.</div></blockquote><br>I actually find this interesting because after my last game that just ended before I signed up for this one, I sort of had a realization that I (and maybe everyone?) put too much stock in logic or analysis, or the quality of an analysis, as determinative of alignment. Individual players who are logical in their town games will almost certainly be logical and show a level of rigor in their analysis in their scum games. Do you really think simply the presence of analytical thought is indicative of town? Or do you think that the thought process Grendel displayed was more likely to come from town?"}

Which is better than playing with complete strangers.</div></div></div><br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">RQS analysis</span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">EagerSnake</span>: I at first thought he made a really derpy scum slip by saying he prefers playing as town (1), but then assigns the numerical value of \u201c1 out of 10\u201d to his enjoyment thus far to this game (5). After taking a moment to think I realized that being a NU would most likely effect his enjoyment. Despite giving me very basic responses he has remained consistent with his answers, which is good. My only nitpick was that I was really hoping for more of a response to question (3) then \u201cNo\u201d. Also like how he was the first to submit answers, I find that town are more likely to contribute to this first, while scum hang back to see if it catches on or not. Town.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">MariaR</span>: I interpreted her responses as light hearted and playful (looking at 2 and 4). Which I attribute towards somebody with little stress. I don\u2019t know Maria well enough to know if she can maintain that level of naturalness as both alignments. I do think her mixing basic terminology is reflective of somebody unafraid of getting called out on petty issues, which I see more coming from a town mindset. I might even say the same thing for (1) and (5) lined up. Maria\u2019s (3) isn\u2019t much better then Snakes. She also submitted answers before cut off. Town lean.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Gamma</span>: There appears to be some mutual level of trust between Gamma, and Snake looking at both responses at (4). I like his response alright. Not confident enough on reading Gamma, he has witnessed me doing RQS before, and is much more likely to know what I want to hear. Even him telling people that I am much more inclined to do this as town then scum doesn\u2019t help because he knows how much I like being town read. Null.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Nn30</span>: Sorry, I\u2019m docking town points for making your first post being a response to my questions. Popular opinion is that RQS helps scum blend in, the thing is that a scum who hasn\u2019t posted in the thread proper before RQS is initiated is more likely to submit answers to RQS before contributing to anything else in the game state. RQS was pretty much the first thing that Nn30 responded to. Answers to (2) and (3) aren\u2019t good, I\u2019ve learned that making a funny instead of actually answering a question (3) isn\u2019t as big a scum tell as I thought, but I still consider it to be scummy. I don\u2019t like (2) because nn30 references multiple games that are similar to mafia in (5), if he has some experience with those then he would have a decent idea how he\u2019ll fair in mafia imo. I do like his enthusiactic (5) tho. scum lean.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Zoronos</span>: He is clearly underestimating my ability to read between the lines. He didn't submit answers to the set, but I value peoples reactions to RQS <span style=\"font-style: italic\">highly</span>, and use them as part of my RQS analysis. I find that it is common for scum planning to go deep to try and play the \u201cvoice of reasoning\u201d, they\u2019ll either treat me like mislead town and correct me, or they\u2019ll correct me while throwing a light scum read my way. Often the ones who choose to paint me as misleading scum are not going to push me. The ones opting to town read me will dig their heels in when I, or they, are questioned about their stance. Clearly  Zoronos is falling into the first category. He insists RQS is pro-scum, throws out a light scum read my way, but doesn\u2019t show any desire to push said scum read. In fact if appears that he is back tracking in his next post. If in this instance Zoronos is scum there is a good chance that he is the \u2018leader\u2019 of his posse, and that his scum buddies are less experienced players then he is. Scum.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Boring</span>: Not a big fan of her responses. Mainly that she seems really guarded in (3) and (4), and also seems insecure at (2). The combination of the two leave a bad taste in my mouth. I\u2019m also noticing boring\u2019s habit of openly underestimating, and down playing her capabilities. I haven\u2019t seen her town games so I have no idea if she does this as both alignments. Null leaning scum.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Lil Uzi Vert</span>:  Really guarded and unhelpful. He has played like this as town before though, so it\u2019s hard to anylse this dude. I will say that I expected him to be more verbose with his stance evasion. This is also the first post of his provide content since a naked RVS vote, so that docks some town points. Null I guess.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Shadow step</span>: He responded to others before submitting answers to my questions. Which says to me that he isn\u2019t occupied with trying to look busy. His answers themselves are okay as well, nothing looks guarded in anyway. Town lean. <br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><br>Implosion</span>: Given his experience he will most likely gravitate towards a null read here for a while. I like his answers, they were nice and open, but I can\u2019t ID anything that reads specify town or maf from it. I still don\u2019t like how he wanted an analysis without submitting his own answers too. That would be like telling me to go play basket ball without providing me a ball first. Null.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">PenguinPower</span>: Really bad. He at first avoids submitting his answers without providing legitimate reasoning why he doesn\u2019t want to. Then later he does out of the blue. I particularly didn\u2019t like how he says \u201csince everybody else is doing it I should too\u201d. It is very scummy to do something just because it is popular; it shows a desire to blend in. As for his answers, (1) reads like wanting pity, and (3) is a guarded answer. Scum.<br><br>So I'm looking as something like:<br><br><span style=\"color: #00BF40\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">EagerSnake, MariaR, ShadowStep, </span></span><span style=\"color: #FFBF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Gamma, Implosion, Lil Uzi Vert,</span></span> <span style=\"color: #FF4000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">boring, Nn30,</span></span> <span style=\"color: #BF0000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Zoronos, PengiunPower</span></span><br><br>^with over 3/4's of roster involved in this reads list there is a good chance that all three scum are here. Typically once RQS takes off (more then half the roster submits something) the scum that would normally stay out of it decide its a good Idea to band wagon. Which effectively means I have light town reads on Deirfire, and Slander. What a good turnout.  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\">"}

Your biggest determiner of order of response is \"Who was reading the thread when you posted the list\", so treating that as alignment indicating will likely lead you down a hole, since 'people that post more' are correlated with 'people that answer soonest'. So using that as an alignment indicator is a bit specious.<br><br>If anything, the answer I'd have been looking most closely at would have been \"Are you often mislynched\". A Yes to that answer might lead me to believe scum opening an AtE avenue.

And Gamma who was there is a null read. Assuming that I'm town reading nothing but the most active players is a bad and lazy asspumtion. Gamma is null despite being top poster, you are scum despite being the third highest contributor. That correlation is bunk.   <br><br>Okay so nobody actually said that they were often mislynched. And if they would have you soiled to opportunity by saying to watch for AtE at (2) in post 96. Only three or four people had submitted answers at that point so you clearly muddied the purpose of that question mr.

The role is Ascetic. Never heard of the role before but after doing a bit of research on it, it doesn't seem often used. If I'm understanding it correctly, I don't see a good reason to not to claim it right away. It's pretty useless for town and does nothing to help catch scum. It heavily favors scum as all tracker and cop actions will fail but also a negative because if you don't claim it right away, people will get suspicious if enough actions fail on you.<br><br>Page 3: <br><br>Penguin feels RQS is a waste of time and says that RVS is better but doesn't give a reason why. I don't understand why he would mention this and not defend why his preferred method of getting the game going is better. For now, I'm going to make a note of this incase he decides to change his mind on answering Grendal's questions.<br><br>Implosion finds Zoro's first post awkward because it looks like scum who can't think of anything to say. What exactly are you suppose to say in RVS? Is there an unwritten code of ethics for RVS? In the same post he claims that Eager's claim pings him really hard but doesn't vote him. Why? <br><br>- The part he brings up about Snake now being a free night kill for scum shouldn't be a concern in my opinion because as long Snake maintains his current level activity, we should have information we can use that can help lead us to find and lynch scum if scum do choose to kill him<br><br>- I don't agree with his take on Zoro's reaction to the claim. The claim is NAI. I also feel the role a majority of people in general would find interesting. <br><br>- Splits his post for whatever reason, and I kinda feel weird now since I agree with part of the first part of the second half of his train of thoughts. Why not just come right out and ask the questions? Who wouldn't we be up for some questions to kick things off at this point in the game? <br><br>- Don't agree with the middle part of this post however, we have a claim that is NAI but he calls this claim and the RVS posts a goldmine. I don't see how we have anything substantial. We had up until this point Gamma and Zoro commenting how negative the role is and then a shit ton of more RVS stuff. Dodges voting for Snake at the end of this point by saying he has his reasons as if he knows more than anyone else at this point. Sure bud.<br><br>Page 4:<br><br>nn's claims not being afraid to die is playing against your win con. I disagree, if you're town playing against your win con is actively choosing to not to scum hunt and if you're scum playing against your win con is not actively always trying to mislead the town. Not being afraid to die seems more of a personality trait. I say this because I'm the same way, at the end of the day this is just a game. If I die, I die. I hate losing as much as the next guy but I can live with myself if I know I tried my best and played to my win con.<br><br>Snake says nn is probably town and doesn't explain how or why. <br><br>Zoro really seems against RQS. I can understand why but at the same time I think he's making too big of a fuss about it. I don't sense an alternative motive from Grendal. <br><br>Page 6:<br><br>As Gamma pointed out and what I originally caught my eye when I did my first reread since I just skimmed the first time, Implosion votes me without even having mentioned me at all. I think we are still in RVS at this point right now but after I did this reread, I get the sense that this a serious vote. Would like to know if he has a real reason for voting me is or is just blindly following<br><br>Penguin decides to answer Grendal's question after all. Says he doesn't want to feel left out. Why does he care about being left out?<br><br>Shadow says he doesn't care about Implosion as he along as Implosion helps him find scum. He seems very confident that Implosion can accomplish this task, I'm starting to wonder here if he knows something we all don't <br><br>Page 7:<br><br>Snake explains what a gut read is and seems like he wants Shadow to explain his gut read on me. Shadow ignores this, I'm currently wondering why.<br><br>Page 8: <br><br>Snake gives out another read and says Zoro is probably town. Doesn't say how he came to this conclusion. <br><br>Boring decides to vote for Zoro and gives an odd metaphor to explain her thoughts on him. Later explains it and it doesn't click with me. Zoro has had to be forced in a way to talk about his self because he has shown a strong dislike for RQS and has had to explained his reasoning for not participating. It's clear why he gave town points to Grendal, Implosion seems to find other players scummier than who is he voting for but refuses to vote for them. This is a good point to bring up and should be brought up until Implosion stops doing it. If I'm understanding the role correctly, I don't see how claiming the role right away is awful. <br><br>Page 9:<br><br>More Boring talk in regards to Zoro. She talks as if the role that Snake claim is useful to town, in my opinion, it has no benefits to town so why act as if he can use this role in a way that would give town an advantage? I disagree in not needing a confirmed town Day 1.

I very much dislike Gamma switching off of me and onto Zoronos when (1) I had given nothing responding to his \"serious vote\", (2) he criticized me for \"trying to flashwagon\" which makes it sound like at least at some level he disapproves of early wagons, and his vote on Zoronos casually makes it the largest wagon yet at 4.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>nn wrote:</cite>Also, in 61 he gives a reason for snake being scummy.

He ends 64 by voting Zoronos. <br><br>Here's what the problem I have with that exchange - he doesn't vote anyone in 61 himself (which contradicts his line of questioning to Zoronos in 64). After snake calls him out in 62, he claims to have a \"number of reasons\" to not vote for snake (wut?) and then goes on to vote Zoronos. </div></blockquote><br>You seem to be misunderstanding how I made those posts. Those were essentially two halves of one post; I essentially only read the thread up to a certain point, posted 61, continued reading, then posted 64. Note the last sentence of 61 explaining this. No reason to make a vote in 61 when I might make another in literally the next post. I mean, Gamma even explained this for me in 63. I <span style=\"font-style: italic\">also</span> gave reasons for Zoronos to be scummy in 61, not just eagersnake. It's not like I voted zoro out of nowhere. I also don't really have much interest in lynching eager today unless he acts exceptionally scummy (and I think his play since claiming is somewhat town). The claim has a chance of sorting itself out for free if he's town and scum consider the free potentially-pr shot worth taking.<br><blockquote><div><cite>nn wrote:</cite>Also, implosion went dark after leaving his vote on luv.

It reflects a stance wherein he believes everyone should be responding first and foremost to him; a responsibility seeking rather than a responsibility avoiding posture.

He didn't call me scum for thinking about Ascetic in terms of being like Miller since they were both negative utility; he just called me wrong and insinuated that I was bad. That's a stance that engenders bad feelings from me towards him, and as scum that's not in favor of his win condition (since negative perception aka anti-charisma means I'm more likely to interpret other things he says negatively, and thus more likely to vote him).

It's pointless quibbling. Also, scum in my experience definitely mute pointless quibbling. Why be hostile to the people on whose good side you need to rely.

Not a solid tell, but enough to move the needle slightly.<br><br>As to the scumminess thereof, other players in this thread certainly tried that line. He could have +1'ed it and doubled down at any time on those player's votes. He chose to not do so. He seemed content to assume I was town or neutral and moved on with the game. He seemed to basically ignore me until I picked a fight with Grendel over Random Questions.

We know he's played with Grendel before and stated a belief that Grendel was town (not one that I necessarily share, but we're exploring mindset and intent here). There is a plausible line of play where town Gamma reads my post about Grendel's methods, assumes I'm running a discredit line, and reflex votes. Built into that is his prejudice to be friendly (and assume Town) for Grendel since they're from the same forum and he stated a town read on Grendel, and to be unfriendly to me (since we argued earlier), but those prejudices make sense based on how the thread has gone so far.<br><br>Basically what I am saying here is that his vote on me is a textbook case of a not alignment indicating behavior, since there are similarly plausible play patterns for either alignment to have taken the actions observed."}

PenguinPower makes a great show of pointing out a seeming contradiction in the way that Gamma Emerald is treating Lil Uzi Vert and implosion, but then votes for Lil Uzi Vert (later clarifying in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8392077#p8392077\">240</a> that this was a result of Lil Uzi Vert not answering RQS and not contributing, which to me both seem like weaker reasons than what PenguinPower gave against Gamma Emerald).

Making that argument is strategy oriented and scum or town could make it. It's more null than anything. <br><br>FYI - I meta dived gamma. In none of the town games I found did he make a point of saying \"I'm town reading xxx.\" He's done that a number of times this game. He's referenced playing mafia scum on another forum - which leads me to believe his play style is relatively consistent. <br><br>Do an ISO dive on him - you'll find him pointing out town reads on a number of people. Then check his past games. I think you'll agree with me."}

I pressured him a lot in that game; I was town, he was scum and he was, I think, a bit more hesitant to engage on such a direct level with calling the arguments I was making bad. He answered the queries I had about him and didn't really comment as much on the quality of my reasoning, iirc. Or at least it doesn't stick in my mind. I think the reaction of calling you bad town or scum is relatively unlikely to come from the scumgame that I saw in that game. 3, those posts in addition to contempt show a certain level of him feeling like he's in-the-right (since he's talking about how he was just being honest with his answers) that I think is consistent with town who feels like they've been accused for bs reasons.<br></div></blockquote><br><br>I don\u2019t know how useful metaing him is when he self proclaimed that he changes up his style in every game he plays. Remember how his play style is \u2018undefined\u2019. If you can reliably meta his plays then that would mean he was holding back information, and fabricated some elaboration when I called his original response guarded... Or it could mean that Penguin over estimates his ability to inject variety into his games.  <br><br>In your last game with him, how much \u2018ethos\u2019 did you carry? E.i. would it have been scary for Scum!Pengiun to 1v1 you in that situation?<br><br>Since RQS is generally viewed as too abstract to be effective by the masses I see contempt in this situation could come from either faction. I could see him doing 219, or 221 as either faction. Also, at the time I\u2019m inclined to think that Penguin would have felt safe from my case, as I had been generally null read, and he was removed as a viable lynch, even heading a wagon against another player. I had not established anything that resembled intelligence, assertiveness, or credibility. Three things that make scum flighty. Nothing about me up until then spelled \u201cthreat\u201d.  Therefore, as scum he was in a good position to brush off my argument.<br><br>Though none of this points to Scum!Penguin specifically. I do think it proves that your observations don\u2019t necessary point toward Town!Pengiun.<br><br>How do you feel about Penguin\u2019s lack of interaction with me at page 3 top, voicing an implied disinterest in RQS before ignoring me.

The phrasing communicates a certain level of aggressive pushback. When I read <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8392095#p8392095\">242</a>, the aggressive pushback seems to have disappeared (while the essence of the argument that Grendel's suspicions are unfounded remains). To me, this suggests that <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8391889#p8391889\">221</a> was intended to simulate an emotional reaction. I'm also not sure that I see anything from Grendel in the intervening posts that would persuasively point to Town alignment for someone who had such a strong feeling that Grendel was playing so poorly as to possibly be masking Mafia intent, but the tonal shift is the main point."}

I honestly had checked out way before I got ran up. Truth is, I don't know what's wrong with the way I play because I've never gotten mislynched before until I've played on here and even then, and so far, I haven't had my play read as lynch bait except the games I've been with you two. <br><br><br>Town: Diefire, Grendal, nn30, Zoro<br>Null: boring, Eager, Gamma, Maria, Prism<br>Scum - Penguin, Shadow<br><br><br>boring - While she does ask questions, she doesn't seem like she is actively trying to solve the game and her votes all seem like a stretch or too convenient. I don't know how to put my feelings about her into the words but I can't shake this vibe from her. I think it's mainly her vote on Zoro, which read more to me as nitpicking about inconsistencies rather than looking for scum. <br><br>Diefire - I liked every single one of his observations he's made so far and agree with almost all of them except the likelihood of Gamma and PP being a team. I'm not saying it's not a possibility, I just don't try to look for teams early on in the game and I like to focus on one person at a time once I feel 90% sure they're scum. <br><br>Eager - He's been very quiet ever since the claim and all he's been doing is throwing out town reads at awkward times without explaining them. He also seems to really have it out for boring for what I assume to be from things he's heard through the grapevine or their previous games together. For now, I'm not seeing what makes him so widely town read but he also hasn't done anything particularly scummy, just odd.<br><br>Gamma - Gamma strikes me as a good dude who's very eager to play mafia and seems to enjoy the game a ton. But, his defense or his use of meta in regards to my play has honestly gotten him into a bind here to the point where I wished he hadn't done it. He doesn't seem to have any bad intentions whenever I read the tone of his posts but I can't argue against the cases presented against him but for now, my gut says he isn't scum.<br><br>Grendal - Outside of the RQS, I've liked a lot of the questions he's asks and I think he's trying his hardest to understand the thoughts and motives behind what everyone is saying and doing. His fixation with Gamma is a little weird, but I understand that they're friends and feeling confident that you aren't being doped by a friend can definitely help go a long way into building that town block Snake was talking about. <br><br>Implosion - I'm still waiting for him to give his thoughts on me but for now I'm not sure what to think of him because while he's been the only player to have voted for me without mentioning why, I've really liked how he's defended himself and presenting his cases.<br><br>Maria - Very hard to read to me but that's mainly because I feel we play similar.<br><br>nn30 - Is actively poking and scum hunting. I like this guy a lot<br><br>Penguin - As I've stated earlier, I am pretty wary of Penguin, especially after how hypocritical he's been about Grendal's RQS. He harps on contributions but I don't see much from him other than relentless attacking for things that are very NAI such as those RQS and inactivity. Like his posts don't make me feel like I should be breaking my neck for this game.<br><br>Prism - Just subbed in. Nothing to go off of.<br><br>Shadow - Like Penguin, I don't get the sense that he's really contributing, he's very quick to just jump on things and doesn't really have sound reasoning for jumping on said things. At first I thought he was just a VI, but he keeps saying that this game is easy or it's almost solved, which baffles me and makes me uneasy. <br><br>Zoro - Outside of his strong dislike for RQS, I get a strong town vibe from him because he truly seems to believe what he stands for and what he's saying. I truly think he's only being scum read because his play is not seen as someone who has to adjust to the way the site plays now."}

When I read <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8392095#p8392095\">242</a>, the aggressive pushback seems to have disappeared (while the essence of the argument that Grendel's suspicions are unfounded remains). To me, this suggests that <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8391889#p8391889\">221</a> was intended to simulate an emotional reaction. I'm also not sure that I see anything from Grendel in the intervening posts that would persuasively point to Town alignment for someone who had such a strong feeling that Grendel was playing so poorly as to possibly be masking Mafia intent, but the tonal shift is the main point.</div></blockquote><br><br>So, yes, tonal shift. But I feel you're explicitly missing the point of a post; look again at 232 and 241 and Penguin's reaction to it in 242. Penguin goes from aggressive to dismissive. I basically came to the same conclusion / point in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8392002#p8392002\">234</a>. Grendel's posting is bad; not scummy bad, just dumb. The tone I get from Penguin is exasperation. He's moving from 'scum or bad town' to 'Oh gosh this is just earnest bad town', in my opinion.<br>The cause of the town shift is very simple; he is super fucking adamant that his method works. That's basically the most responsibility seeking behavior possible; in the face of multiple people telling him that his method won't catch scum and moving on, he chooses instead to double down on his poor method. He all but stamped his feet and crossed his arms in the thread. It's perhaps the least responsibility avoidant behavior I've seen this entire game.<br><br>So, you're either missing an obvious cause for the tone shift, or not understanding the tone shift. There is a better case available against Penguin (in my mind), so I'm really curious why you chose this specific case."}

Here is my reasoning.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">implosion</span></span> has a few consistencies of thought. I liked the vote for Lil Uzi Vert in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8389526#p8389526\">131</a>, and the reaction to Gamma Emerald in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8392600#p8392600\">247</a>. These are consistent with the evolving reads presented in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8392659#p8392659\">257</a> (implosion was initially suspicious of Grendel, Zoronos, and eagerSnake, so it makes sense that he would move his vote to a wagon like Lil Uzi Vert).<br>He also has good points on Gamma (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8392613#p8392613\">251</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8392659#p8392659\">257</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8395116#p8395116\">333</a>).<br>Lastly, the read on PenguinPower given in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8395088#p8395088\">330</a> is thoughtful and makes clear effort to understand motivations for actions (although I suspect that when I read the game in question I will be able to come up with at least two reasons for the mismatch).<br><br>As a side note, I recall implosion as a source of quality analysis in a prior game (<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&amp;t=63461\" class=\"postlink\">link</a>--I'm not counting <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&amp;t=65286\" class=\"postlink\">Mini 1762</a> because I never actually played). I'm therefore aware of what implosion said in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8389525#p8389525\">130</a>; still, I think that these points make implosion more likely to be Town.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">nn30</span></span> is a seemingly uncontroversial read, so I'll be brief. The look at prior games in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8389141#p8389141\">90</a> indicates a certain amount of motivation to discover information. I also agree with points raised by Zoronos in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8394481#p8394481\">303</a>.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">As for you (Grendel)</span></span>, I think that your RQS is probably not indicative of alignment, but your reaction to those who question RQS (in particular the last line of your <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8392080#p8392080\">241</a>) seems more likely to come from a Town player (there's a path of less resistance if you're Mafia just looking to fabricate some reads). Your case on PenguinPower agrees with my read and does not strike me as likely to come from a Mafia partner (unlike Gamma Emerald); this is further reinforced by the way that PenguinPower responds to you."}

He cracks back at Gamma for Gamma's Implosion vote (Implosion talked about A, then voted B without any further mention of that player), which was an incongruence on the part of Implosion; I can see a town mindset where Gamma brings that up. So painting it as scummy is incorrect. Going after Gamma for it is not really reasonable; it's searching for something that can be painted as guilty but which has no real correlation with guilt.<br>Similarly, going after the wording 'serious vote' is silly; why is clarity suddenly a scumtell.<br>I attempted to engage him on Gamma, but he just waved it away without discussion (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8394878#p8394878\">327</a>) then voted <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8395164#p8395164\">335</a>. I can kinda see a world here were PP thinks I'm just a moron, and envisions an Implosion / Gamma scum team, but he already got on Gamma's case for voting Implosion, and now he's voting Gamma for thinking Implosion is town.<br>So, yeah, I think Penguin's case on Gamma was built on a heap of not alignment indicating factors, and that to me says it's a bad case and one worthy of attack.<br><br>He's also not spending any time working with other players or cooperatively developing reads. He's camped out in his own valley, where he mostly just squabbles with Gamma and Grendel; not very contributory towards the greater town objective.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">However</span> I am not really ready to make that case yet. There are some counter indicating factors I'd like to sort out first.<br>Reading the connecting theme of his posts, there is a strong tone of aggrieved frustration. Between asking for the lynch to complete, complaining at Grendal about his methodology (without calling Grendal scum, this is important), and generally just sniping at Gamma. When he noted that Salandar's slot was afk, that's could be a legitimate frustration. Having someone just not participate is shitty for town, so it's easy to envision a town getting annoyed at an obvious oversight. For scum it's much less of an issue (unless that slot is also scum) since it's one less person they have to trick.<br><br>I also think your commentary in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8398372#p8398372\">515</a> is off base. It's NAI (in my opinion) for him to note it. He responded to Grendel (in a frustrated fashion), posted about an AFK, and then went right back to talking to Grendel. It wasn't some epic deflection."}

It feels somewhat forced or like she's posting it for the sake of having posted it. It also feels like the reads themselves make a lot of sense from scum; the top several players are all my more confident townreads, so it's consistent with my view of the game that she'd have sprinkled her scumbuddies near the middle. Although again I don't want to put too much stock in that since it's dependent on reads of other players. Calling PP \"dismissive in a way I only see with scum\" is just weird. I see that kind of dismissiveness so much with experienced town players who feel like they're dealing with newbies and PP's dismissiveness looks pretty much identical to that to me; the way she qualifies it as \"only in scum\" sounds like it might not be accurate because of that.<br><br>I want to call Maria town but that's entirely gut that I'll probably try to substantiate later. <br><br>That mostly just leaves LUV, dierfire and prism to sort."}

I think most of his questions are bad and his lines of inquiry (prior to today. I really haven't taken the time yet to process the stuff that has happened today) betray a lack of knowledge about what behaviors are actually scummy. His beliefs, whoever wrong or poorly guided, seems sincerely held however. He's trying to solve the game, or at least giving a damn good impression that he's trying to do so. That says townish to me. <br>One thing that stands out to me is that he seems to think calling something wrong and calling something scummy are one and the same. Which is not true, but it is an indication that he very much wants to be taken seriously and have his views respected.<br><br>I threw together a bit of a reads list in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8397130#p8397130\">393</a> and my reads on Boring and Maria haven't really changed since that point. I find both have been content light, exempting Boring's last reads list which I haven't really internalized yet. Some of it I disagree with, some of it I agree with (I'll come back to this in a bit).<br><br>Maria explicitly mentioned that she doesn't want to share in the <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8397171#p8397171\">405</a> through <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8397262#p8397262\">408</a> sequence, and I really just don't know how to play through that. It's so off the wall I don't find myself able to shake my head and call it scummy. It just is so orthogonal to the way I analyze the game I don't know how to engage her. So, basically, bucket of ????.<br><br>Boring is in the ???? bucket as well. I really don't understand her 'strong town' reading on Shadow_Step. He's at the top of her town list and it makes no sense to me. She cites aggresiveness and grandiosity as town tells, and the former I don't find a town tell unless backed by reasoning and consensus building, and the later I don't think I see in ShadowStep's posting. I agree with her Implosion read at the time she made it, for basically the reason she listed in her list, so I'm wondering if I don't have that read wrong.<br>Basically, I feel like she's coasting in the middle of the pack, and that itself puts me on edge. I am not seeing effort to get out front and lead a case or do real deep scum hunting. But some of her opinions and thoughts are quite solid, so I am conflicted on her to sort her.<br><br>The dichotomy between Boring and Maria here is interesting; Maria is hard to sort because she is content light (apparently purposefully), and Boring is hard to sort because some of her content makes me go \"Yup, that's scummy def\" and some is \"Well, that is pretty darn reasonable\"."}

In that game, PenguinPower attracted suspicion mainly from implosion, who gave clear and detailed reasoning that was received well by other players (at one point two players followed implosion without adding much to the case, implying that implosion had some standing--it is also notable that PenguinPower characterized implosion as \"manipulative\" in that game).<br><br>I also think that this point still stands (I'm adding that the case in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8394670#p8394670\">312</a> pulls mostly from material before <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8392077#p8392077\">240</a>):<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8396688#p8396688\" class=\"postlink\">post 351</a>, Dierfire wrote:</cite>I definitely don't like the interaction between Gamma Emerald and PenguinPower finishing in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8390055#p8390055\">149</a>. PenguinPower makes a great show of pointing out a seeming contradiction in the way that Gamma Emerald is treating Lil Uzi Vert and implosion, but then votes for Lil Uzi Vert (later clarifying in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8392077#p8392077\">240</a> that this was a result of Lil Uzi Vert not answering RQS and not contributing, which to me both seem like weaker reasons than what PenguinPower gave against Gamma Emerald).

They're a good multitool-they're reads so nobody can complain about you not giving content, they're easy to justify (\"I like X and it makes me lean town on them\") or shrug off entirely, they're easy to go back on (\"After thinking about X I guess it's not that big of a deal, on the other hand Y really makes me lean scum\") in future days, and they serve as additional justification for narrowing your choice of votes.<br><br>Rationality and consistency aren't reliable town indicators.

I included the \"this is more circumstantial and definitely weaker\" line because I'm trying to be transparent in my reads. I was not admitting to \"volume over quality\" as you suggest. <br><br>I don't know wtf shadow was thinking. The I've harped on how poor the play was from town!shadow for a few pages, so I'm not going to do that again here. The play was bad from a scum!shadow too but I'm willing to bet he's a gambling / gambit kind of guy. This is why I continue to scum read him.<br><br>I said I'm obv town because of the <span style=\"font-style: italic\">vast number of people</span> who have town read me so far. Self vouches, as you point out, tend to feel scummy. I didn't self vouch on page one with no context - I self vouched well into a game where a significant number of people had town read me.

Either way, how can so many of you accept eager's piss-poor \"town\" performance without resistance? I mean, eager has bragged twice now about how shitty town is playing by not calling him out for his lazy vote. You're all just taking the insult with pride, it would appear. <span class=\"noboldsig\">The only positive thing I can say about this development is my wagon. It decreases the likelihood that eagerSnake, MariaR and implosion are ALL scum.</span> I'll have to try to knock at least one out of the running. <br><br>If scum want to chainsaw me up to L-1, that's fine, but don't let them hammer without warning.

You had a scumlean on him and the thing holding you back from that was <span style=\"font-style: italic\">an uncced ascetic claim.</span> When (1) tons of people have been explaining why it makes sense for him to claim it as a mafia ascetic (so the claim itself isn't a strong reason to townread him). And more importantly (2), being an uncced ascetic isn't a particularly townish thing... like, I can understand this if he were an uncced cop or doctor or tracker or generally an uncced power role, because making a power role claim puts you in the limelight and makes you suspicious if you don't die the next night. But I find it hard to believe that this was the only thing holding you back from scumreading him or more specifically that it would hold you back from scumreading him.<br><br>Second bolded part feels super contrived. Calling an L-2 wagon on herself positive as if to shout \"hey, i don't really care if i'm lynched bc i'm not scum\" from the rooftops with no regard to how harmful it would be if we lynch her and not eagerSnake in the event that she's town and he's scum (which, to be clear, I do not believe but she does). Giving the positive that you've eliminated one out of 200+ possible scumteams further evidences that she doesn't actually feel like the wagon on her is a good thing, she's just BSing to try to look like town-who-doesn't-care-if-they're-wagoned. If she were town she would be concerned about the wagon on her competing with the wagon on eagerSnake, or if she was genuinely glad about it would have more to say about it than \"these three people aren't all scum\" which is so likely to be true a priori as to have evidence in favor of it be utterly meaningless (reducing an 0.5% chance to an 0.1% chance is not meaningful, and that would require insanely strong evidence to do). We'll see what she has to say when she gives more analysis on it.<br><br>Posting from work because I really needed to get this off my mind while it's fresh. Will have more to say on the es-ss fiasco later. But it's gonna be more of what you've already heard."}

I can be a bit more specific. eager's insistence that they're both town, the way he's doing it, and his irritation resulting from shadow's play are pretty damn close to how I'd respond as town. They are also somewhat close to how I'd respond as scum. So I don't really read him solely off of the fact that he's calling himself and shadow both town. I think he is making an effort to get shadow to reconsider and has realized that it's futile, and that's not really useful for determining his alignment. <br><br>I think the emotional content of his reaction looks consistent; I think he was looking like town before shadow claimed; I think the way he talks about shadow (i.e. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8405574#p8405574\">1060</a>) sounds more reminiscent of town who has given up because they realize they're up against someone who will never change their mind rather than scum, who I feel would spend more energy directly trying to prove that they are town to players other than shadow. I think two town ascetics is honestly more likely than a town ascetic and a mafia ascetic, or than a town ascetic and a mafia goon or whatever fakeclaiming ascetic, because of the context of the large normal I linked where podoboq was one of two macho townies. <br><br>So yes, what eager is doing is something scum would potentially do but it's also certainly something town would do and it looks that way to me. I agree with his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8407505#p8407505\">1119</a>."}

That being, he was an uncc'd town claim, which left unchallenged, left him as a prime night kill target (because of the probably confirmed town status). As I also stated several times, if he lived to tomorrow, I'd re-evaluate.

Never the head of either - the player leading the charge for the lynch. While you were on PP, you didn't talk about him much at all or advocate for that train to move forwards. You mostly seemed to be talking to Grendel. (I kind of liked your evaluation of Grendel's conciliatory post to Gamma, actually <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8403204#p8403204\">623</a>). <br>However that suspicion also never seemed to get pushed based the suspicion phase.<br><br>At the time of the CC, you had Eager as your number 2 town read, after SS at number one. That suggests, to me, that you didn't have a lot of skepticism about his claim. Furthermore, I find \"He survived the night, he must be scum\" to be a really awful way to evaluate PR's (since it depends on the playstyle of the scum team on whether they are risk averse or not, which is hidden information). It makes it really easy for scum to try to lynch PR's by building up mistrust.<br><br>So, when you immediately flipped on him as soon as the CC happens, that seems scummy to me. You didn't take the time to re-evaluate the read or look for other indications on whether he was scummy. Just 'Oh counterclaim yup top scum' and a vote. There wasn't evidence of skepticism or evaluation. If someone counterclaims one of my top town reads, I am always going to try and think carefully about why my town read might have been wrong, or if something else is afoot.<br><br>So, I don't think you've done a lot of active scum hunting, haven't been an evangelist for the trains you've been on, and I question your sudden certainty on Eager-scum. Those things add up to my gut thinking you're playing a happy coincidence of two town having the same role modifier, and you get a free mislynch.<br>However, the logical case hasn't caught up to my gut and I am wary of just interpreting events into conf-bias land. So I'm not entirely convinced that you're the villain quite yet - at least not until we've had a chance to chat a bit more."}

Yes, it will probably take some finagling (either we have a lot of power or a lot of our PRs are passive, most likely, or the mafia also have roles that the ascetics screw with) but it is by no means out of the question or, imo, even that strange. Uncommon, sure.</div></blockquote><br><br>Ok...so it's possible, but uncommon, and would take \"finagling\" to get it approved for balance.  It's also something that hasn't been seen before in a mini-normal game.  I'm going to stick with the simplest theory and keep my vote on eager.  Greatest chance of flipping scum right now."}

I'm not sure if there's many other ways to put it. Why do you not just advocate it now?<br><br>I scumread boring for a really long time but the more I read the more I'm convinced I'm wrong to scumread the weird phrases (Zoronos jacket analogy, Shadow townread, etc.) as it appears to be more of a personality thing. The biggest reason to scumread her instead is the frustration she displays with me/Eager, especially the latter who is purportedly her top scumread. #1165's end does a better job of verbalizing this frustration if it's legitimate.<br><br>I'm still trying to keep up with the pace but I still don't really like any of implosion/LUV/Eager.<br><br>Both parts of <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8405811#p8405811\" class=\"postlink\">#1168</a> has more of implosion being reasonable up until it concerns someone he wants lynched. The rhetoric is also incredibly similar to what I said about his townread on Shadow_Step, which he called indefensible and unhelpful. Why approach someone else's townread the same way I did if he thought such an approach \"didn't merit a response\". The first part is consistent with what boring's said throughout the game, with <span class=\"noboldsig\">implosion specifically citing consistency as a towntell</span> repeatedly throughout the game. The second part is just downright awful and a major stretch, and again I find it hard to believe that with the level of thought implosion tries to appear to put into the game, this is one of the ones getting his mental stamp of approval.<br><br>LUV's been so standoffish during this entire shitfest. It's possible he's finding it hard to keep up with the game, like I'm sure we all are, but voting Shadow and then basically turning into one himself reads to me like someone just waiting for town to fuck ourselves over.<br><br>Eager has pretty quickly switched from \"perfect scumplay\" to overplaying his hand hard with the constant \"I'm town and I'll flip it watch out.\" It shows that he saw what was working and decided to keep approaching that angle without realizing the returns diminish significantly as you go. I really wanted to vote Implosion here but it's pretty clear to me that nobody is willing to do it-hit me up if that changes.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: eagerSnake</span><br><br>That's back to L-1."}

Never the head of either - the player leading the charge for the lynch. While you were on PP, you didn't talk about him much at all or advocate for that train to move forwards. You mostly seemed to be talking to Grendel. (I kind of liked your evaluation of Grendel's conciliatory post to Gamma, actually <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8403204#p8403204\">623</a>). <br>However that suspicion also never seemed to get pushed based the suspicion phase.<br><br>At the time of the CC, you had Eager as your number 2 town read, after SS at number one. That suggests, to me, that you didn't have a lot of skepticism about his claim. Furthermore, I find \"He survived the night, he must be scum\" to be a really awful way to evaluate PR's (since it depends on the playstyle of the scum team on whether they are risk averse or not, which is hidden information). It makes it really easy for scum to try to lynch PR's by building up mistrust.<br><br>So, when you immediately flipped on him as soon as the CC happens, that seems scummy to me. You didn't take the time to re-evaluate the read or look for other indications on whether he was scummy. Just 'Oh counterclaim yup top scum' and a vote. There wasn't evidence of skepticism or evaluation. If someone counterclaims one of my top town reads, I am always going to try and think carefully about why my town read might have been wrong, or if something else is afoot.<br><br>So, I don't think you've done a lot of active scum hunting, haven't been an evangelist for the trains you've been on, and I question your sudden certainty on Eager-scum. Those things add up to my gut thinking you're playing a happy coincidence of two town having the same role modifier, and you get a free mislynch.<br>However, the logical case hasn't caught up to my gut and I am wary of just interpreting events into conf-bias land. So I'm not entirely convinced that you're the villain quite yet - at least not until we've had a chance to chat a bit more.</div></blockquote><br><br>My read on you was a shot in the dark, based off the oddness I picked up. I've gone back through the thread to re-read since then, and I noticed you mentioning your friend. Something I missed my first time around, which would easily exacerbate the disconnect I was picking up at first. As your posts normalized, and I could see that you weren't adjusting your behavior to suit my scumread, I lost interest in your wagon. Even at the time of my vote, I'd have been more suspicious of a flash wagon than your behavior. <br><br>Then, I noticed PP being reactive, dismissive, and disingenuous, so I hopped onto his wagon with S_s. I did argue when people got off his wagon:<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8403169#p8403169\" class=\"postlink\">post 616</a>, boring wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8403144#p8403144\" class=\"postlink\">post 609</a>, PenguinPower wrote:</cite>We should definitely lynch Gamma.

Experienced players will be consistent almost always, and many players will have some inconsistencies in what they say as their reads change or they forget about minor things they noticed earlier. The main time I remember citing consistency earlier was in criticizing gamma for being inconsistent about a major read (or at least what seemed like a major read) over the span of &lt;24 hours, which indicated a lack of a consistent internal thought process.

Consistency on its own isn't always a tell. Experienced players will be consistent almost always, and many players will have some inconsistencies in what they say as their reads change or they forget about minor things they noticed earlier. The main time I remember citing consistency earlier was in criticizing gamma for being inconsistent about a major read (or at least what seemed like a major read) over the span of &lt;24 hours, which indicated a lack of a consistent internal thought process. Consistency in general is not indicative of town.</div></blockquote>Acting like I don't know consistency isn't necessarily a towntell has to be a joke. It really does.

It feels somewhat forced or like she's posting it for the sake of having posted it. It also feels like the reads themselves make a lot of sense from scum; the top several players are all my more confident townreads, so it's consistent with my view of the game that she'd have sprinkled her scumbuddies near the middle. Although again I don't want to put too much stock in that since it's dependent on reads of other players. Calling PP \"dismissive in a way I only see with scum\" is just weird. I see that kind of dismissiveness so much with experienced town players who feel like they're dealing with newbies and PP's dismissiveness looks pretty much identical to that to me; the way she qualifies it as \"only in scum\" sounds like it might not be accurate because of that.</div></blockquote>This doesn't look like he was using it as a reason for uncertainty or a point in her favor to me."}

With eagerSnake, I was half expecting him to withdraw the claim; the fact that he hasn't rules out some Town plays (Bulletproof or Miller trying to draw the kill were my first thoughts, I also thought of Wary but I don't know if that's common on this site because I can't find it in the Wiki--certainly it's not Normal). It also weighs against some Mafia plays (I agree with the idea that a Mafia Ascetic role is powerful and probably unlikely to claim early without withdrawing the claim later, so I'd find a Mafia Goon more likely).<br><br>A few points since the claim make me suspicious of eagerSnake.

PenguinPower makes a great show of pointing out a seeming contradiction in the way that Gamma Emerald is treating Lil Uzi Vert and implosion, but then votes for Lil Uzi Vert (later clarifying in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8392077#p8392077\">240</a> that this was a result of Lil Uzi Vert not answering RQS and not contributing, which to me both seem like weaker reasons than what PenguinPower gave against Gamma Emerald).

It got a lot more confusing and has ultimately led us nowhere seeing as both wagons are starting to fade a bit now. Problem is we still have to address the counterclaim due to the majority of us feeling it is very unlikely of two players receiving a role like Ascetic in a mini normal. If he's scum though, he successfully turn the majority of Day 1 into a 1v1 showdown and buys his team two nights since he will most likely be lynched Day 2 if Snake flips scum. This doesn't read as too much of a gamble to me depending on who his partners are. It buys the scum team enough time to figure out who to kill and blend in even more. <br><br>The second part of the latter is, you state that you were planning this from the beginning but come up empty with little to no information. A counter claim such as this I would think someone would at least compile a lot more data in order to convince the town that you're right.<br><br>My point is in short is that he's not thinking about anything he does and is just running with plans without any end goal in sight. This strikes me as a clueless gambling sort of type.<br><br>But I realize that I'm probably not going to sell anyone on this today but I'm still not buying any of the leading wagons so who wants to help me look elsewhere?"}

So, Prism's posting in terms of 'Here is how to play mafia effectively' goes along a lot of the same lines as my thinking about how you play the game (not necessarily same conclusions, but very similar mental rules for what to look for and what is meaningful). I want to say this is towny, but bias is so easy in that type of system. However, he is persecuting his reads pretty unerringly, so that is towny.<br>Now, on Implosion. He's been thin all game; that is, my general impression is that he doesn't do a lot to try and steer the conversation. He comments on this, but doesn't push. I am suspicious of anyone willing to just float along. However, he has had a few posts (I'm playing off the top of my head here rather than from notes / ISO, so if you want research it will have to be a follow up post later) that made me nod and decreased my suspicion. However, a body of work and a few posts aren't the same thing - It does mean he's not my top scum read, but I remain skeptical. When I last compiled a reads list, I had a note in there that said he couldn't be scum with SS (and I think one other player, but I forget who at this point), who was my other main read, and I think that's borne out at this point because I doubt SS is scum running the play he's running."}

It could be a scum ploy but why the hell would he do it as scum, but also why the hell would he say it as town, etc. Not ultimately super meaningful I think. <br><br>On the other hand, I hate to beat a dead horse of almost-everything-boring-says-sounds-scummy but I really dislike boring's reaction... again. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>boring wrote:</cite>So, rather than lynching scum (or at the very least learning from a town flip), you're suggesting we give them a free night kill, and start this mess up again tomorrow? We're better off lynching today. Even if it turns out to be me (though I'd hardly call that \"plan A\").</div></blockquote><br>This is such an incredibly tepid response for someone who has been pushing eager so consistently since shadow claimed. Compare penguin's reaction, and Zoronos's reaction, and even nn who remarks that it's worth looking at his old games based on this. boring's reaction just reeks of scum who doesn't know how people are going to react and wants to test the waters before committing to saying something like \"oh my god, only scum would possibly suggest a no lynch, can we please lynch him already.\" Which I would expect from town-boring here (obviously not in those words but etc).<br><br>That paragraph from boring does not read like town talking to their top scumread. It does not read like town with a strong investment in lynching the person they are talking to. I could buy it as town talking to someone that they're trying to make up their mind on. But I can't buy it as town talking to their top scumread. It just sounds like detached, rehearsed advice.</div></blockquote><br><br>Agreed on the Boring thoughts. My vote stays where it is rn."}

It's relatively rare for me to get a scumread on d1 that I'm confident enough on to want to try to steer the conversation. Much more common is for me to get a townread that I'm confident enough to try to steer the conversation on, which you can probably see is the case with eager and to some extent shadow.<br><br>I have a similar opinion wrt eager's mention of nolynching as a possibility as those who have weighed in, it really just doesn't make any sense at all. It could be a scum ploy but why the hell would he do it as scum, but also why the hell would he say it as town, etc. Not ultimately super meaningful I think. <br><br>On the other hand, I hate to beat a dead horse of almost-everything-boring-says-sounds-scummy but I really dislike boring's reaction... again. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>boring wrote:</cite>So, rather than lynching scum (or at the very least learning from a town flip), you're suggesting we give them a free night kill, and start this mess up again tomorrow? We're better off lynching today. Even if it turns out to be me (though I'd hardly call that \"plan A\").</div></blockquote><br>This is such an incredibly tepid response for someone who has been pushing eager so consistently since shadow claimed. Compare penguin's reaction, and Zoronos's reaction, and even nn who remarks that it's worth looking at his old games based on this. boring's reaction just reeks of scum who doesn't know how people are going to react and wants to test the waters before committing to saying something like \"oh my god, only scum would possibly suggest a no lynch, can we please lynch him already.\" Which I would expect from town-boring here (obviously not in those words but etc).<br><br>That paragraph from boring does not read like town talking to their top scumread. It does not read like town with a strong investment in lynching the person they are talking to. I could buy it as town talking to someone that they're trying to make up their mind on. But I can't buy it as town talking to their top scumread. It just sounds like detached, rehearsed advice.</div></blockquote><br><br>Agreed on the Boring thoughts. My vote stays where it is rn.</div></blockquote><br><br>See... I think this reaction is really overwrought tbh. It's mountains out of mole hills.<br>Everyone is going to react to stupid play (which is what advocating no-lynch is) differently. Yes, for newbies advocating no lynch is a clear scumtell, but that's a newbie specific thing. For everyone else it's just a bad-tell. In this case, it's easy to see this as a manifestion of frustration from Boring - I know my rule of thumb is 'talk to people like they're town, talk about people like they're scum'. It doesn't say much about Boring that she doesn't specifically belabor the 'lol you'll flip scum lol' line; it's annoying enough dealing with it from ShadowStep (and the converse from Eager).<br><br>Hell, I know my tone frequently will go to 'Advise people when bad play is occurring, ignore alignment'.<br>Also, \"I agree with everyone else\" -&gt; Thanks for that incredible out-front stance.<br>Implosions post there struck me as conciliatory and no-risk, and he based scum reads on NAI factors. aka a bad post."}

She didn't seem to do any work to suss out which of Eager and SS were the correct lynch, she just followed her top read SS to turn on her second to top read. I was in the middle of inquisiting this a bit when the hammer came down, but there we are.<br>PenguinPower - He put his vote on Eager quite promptly after the claim, then did nothing to try and figure out which side was telling the truth. He responded to some questions about himself (his secondary read being Gamma) and otherwise reiterated over and over to lynch Snake. Of particular note - I don't feel Penguin can be scum with either Grendel or Boring.<br>Grendel  - Primarily he was afk but his posting before he left was largely off topic. He kept promising to look into Boring but that never materialized. So we'll see what he does with that today. I'm giving him a bit of a break since I assume he's not lying about IRL obligations in order to dodge mafia / excuse lurking.<br><br>The other two players here specifically that weren't explicitly on my earlier lists are Implosion and LUV.<br>LUV - In short, LUV's posting at the end of the day was nonsense.  He posted a bit about SS, but frankly most of it was crazy. But he at least was kinda trying to prosecute a case on SS, so he gets some semblance of respect for that, however misguided I feel he was.<br>Implosion - He wasn't on the Eagersnake wagon. He engaged with Boring, Prism, SS. With Boring and Prism, but he primarily was prosecuting a case on either of those players; he was responding to them going after him. However, for SS he was primarily trying to argue SS out of the tunnel on Eager. This is a key part of my conflicted opinion on Implosion. I don't think scum Implosion would spend so many words arguing with SS, trying to convince him that there is a possibility of a town Eager. However, he doesn't spend a lot of time actually prosecuting his scum read on Boring (that's where his vote was), so I can see a world where he is simply wasting time on purpose with SS.<br><br>So, that's where my head is. I feel like I should re-read and rethink on Prism, but I was thinking towny at the end of the day yesterday so I keep shuffling that to low priority work."}

I figure it is more likely that there would be two aesthetics\u2019 then shadow being scum. I think i said this before though.<br><br>Deirfire: I had read some of his prevous games before this one started, and this game largely reflects Town!Deir. I read two Scum!Deir games: DankMeme, and Symphonic metal mafia. Both of which Deir was lurking scum, having and keeping a low profile. The town games i read were two newbie\u2019s he SE/IC\u2019d for, and a mini normal that i don\u2019t think had a name(numerical). In those Deirfire, while not being a especially prolific poster did keep on top of things and left dense posts when he could throughout the games. This game has been very reflective of Town!Deir, especially once nearing EoD yesterday.   <br><br>NN30: His effort D1 and approach to the game resonates town to me. His case, and interest in boring is good and i think he has some valid points on her. I think that his suspicion on Shadow is justifiable as town, and more importantly not a something he\u2019d push as scum yesterday. If nn30 were scum he most likely stick to eager, because imo Eager was an easy lynch to bite onto. Through the day he has been showing a consistent effort to figure things out and solve the game. I don\u2019t know his experience outside of this site, but it would be very hard for an unseasoned scum to be so ontop of things that have been happening. He as scum would have had many opportunities to back off the game and let town fight each other, but he didn\u2019t do that. Believe it or not I also thought times he has referred to himself as Ob!town were rather town like. I guess this a bit of a gut read. Its just that effort he is putting into the game smells like town.<br><br>Prism: His desire to get attention yesterday when he felt like nobody was listening to him looked like very anti-mafia behavior, most scum would be happy being sidelined. Therefore i think it is more likely Prism is town -just for that-. I also think he may be onto something with Implosion. It also appears that he was the originator of the <span style=\"font-style: italic\">Implosion saying thoughtful, but empty things from the sidelines while also targeting easy marks</span> opinion.

So I'd like some clarification. <br><br>I'd also like some clarification on how you (seemingly, I may be misinterpreting things here) are simultaneously criticizing me for tunneling you on d1 and for not having strong reads on d1.</div></blockquote><br>I was noting the sequence of events. Prism tunnels you, then you tunnel me. To expand, it's a good, risk-free distraction because there was already a wagon on me. It takes you from a defensive position to an offensive one. If you're scum, it's exactly the right move to keep you under the radar. <br><br>Regarding the issue wit reads, the criticism you noted wasn't all that confusing. You were criticized for not having reads (not by me). You responded by explaining that you don't have reads day 1, that it's just how you operate, and then proceeded to tunnel me (ironically, for something that's clearly personality based). It's the timing that I find fishy, not the action itself. Everyone who participates, and takes risks, gets tunneled at some point. Your tunnel in particular seemed artificial and \"safe\". <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8426488#p8426488\" class=\"postlink\">post 1592</a>, Zoronos wrote:</cite>Boring - Her posting was mostly defensive, we went over this in detail yesterday about why he read flipped.

I'm just not fan of a not lynching on Day 1 for various reasons and the fact that while I thought it was a reaction test, the part of me that thought he was seriously asking and advocating for it kept nagging at me and eventually won out.

He's not attacking Grendel's method, he's attacking Grendel. It is an attack on credibility \"First year pysch student\" is how you set up the rest of the thread to ignore Grendel regardless of what Grendel says. That's very scummy. Your second reference (221) is strictly NAI. He's pointing out that his own meta has changed which... says nothing since it's an empty statement. Scum say it to avoid getting meta'ed (and because it's usually true) and town say it because it's true.<br>At the time those interactions happened, PP was not under pressure.

I think that, from a probabilistic perspective, it makes more sense from a Town player claiming legitimately than from a Mafia player making a gamble (this is where I was after the initial claim). Whether that was a reason sufficient to justify the apparent strength of the read given by boring is a matter best answered by boring (I, for example, had eagerSnake as one of my weaker reads); I looked to <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8389054#p8389054\">73</a> for an answer and it seemed that boring thought the claim sufficient that eagerSnake would either die or be held in suspicion for living. Therefore none of the reaction from boring to the second claim seemed out of place to me. In fact, of all the players that wanted to lynch eagerSnake after the second claim from Shadow_step, boring had the most prior evidence that her read on eagerSnake was primarily based on the first claim.<br><br>You also made the point that boring seemed artificially rather than genuinely unconcerned about the wagon forming on her. To assess this, I would look at her attempts to read those voting for her (if she is genuine that the wagon on her is in part a positive thing because it informs the alignments of players on the wagon, she should show evidence of trying to use that information). She had appropriate questions out to nn30 (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8409783#p8409783\">1266</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8413118#p8413118\">1363</a>, especially <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8413334#p8413334\">1382</a>) and Gamma Emerald (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8413161#p8413161\">1365</a>). She appears to have made some attempt to read you as well (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8425328#p8425328\">1555</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8427761#p8427761\">1609</a>) and to have revisited Gamma Emerald in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8427822#p8427822\">1610</a>. I was hoping to have a deeper analysis from her with the results of those inquiries; I will prompt her directly.<br><br>You made the third point (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8417063#p8417063\">1463</a>) that boring had a \"tepid\" response (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8416740#p8416740\">1453</a>) to the suggestion from eagerSnake that we pass on the lynch. It seems clear to me that boring was demonstrating that better play from eagerSnake as Town would have been to push for lynching boring rather than no lynch at all (I don't read \"are you suggesting that we give a free kill to the Mafia?\" as a serious question but rather as a rhetorical one). I've no problem with the tenor of her response; I acknowledge your argument that it sounds \"detached\" but find this unpersuasive as a reason to vote for boring."}

That's very scummy.</div></blockquote><br>It is very much not a tact that I would expect Penguin-scum to take based on my other game with him. I also just don't think it's as likely of a scum tact in general as you think it is; my focus as scum isn't generally on making ad hominem attacks. It's on looking town. Ad hominem attacks don't generally look town. And making one, like Penguin did, puts him out there in a way that (1) is, again, not consistent with the scum I saw in the other game and (2) just bad play as scum. It isn't good play as scum to discredit your attacker in a way that puts you in the limelight, like with an ad hominem.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Zoronos wrote:</cite>Your second reference (221) is strictly NAI. He's pointing out that his own meta has changed which... says nothing since it's an empty statement. Scum say it to avoid getting meta'ed (and because it's usually true) and town say it because it's true.</div></blockquote><br>You use the word \"strictly\" and I don't think it means what you think it means... you aren't going to like this, but I really think the tone in that post is town-indicative. It seems like, beyond the similarities in our styles that I think I've seen in this game, you simply approach scumhunting differently. I don't think that the content of what people say is the only thing important about it; certainly it is important, but emotional inflection, tone, and so on can also very much inform whether something is genuine. As an example, my main tact as scum is to, in the majority of cases, try to emulate what I would do as town by observing the game state and mimicking the opinions that I would hold if I were town. I'm sure other people use a similar tact, and to the extent that they are successful, it is important to use things other than simply content to discern alignment. Sure, there are actions, which are, again, also useful. But in cases like the one I'm describing tone is important.<br><br>And I really think PP's tone is townish. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Zoronos wrote:</cite>At the time those interactions happened, PP was not under pressure. Grendel's vote was the first one on him. Discrediting an accuser who had just voted him would be pretty relevant to a scum game plan. The rest of your clear distills to 'meta', which I put no stock in. Show me why he's town in this game.</div></blockquote><br>Your entire reading of these posts is just one-dimensional. Discrediting an accuser is something that makes total sense as either town or scum. For scum it makes sense, yes, because it's a part of their game plan; for town, it makes sense because a townie who is accused knows for a fact that the accuser is in the wrong, and that they are in the right, and being mislynched is bad. In the latter case, where PP is town, we would expect him discrediting a bad attack on him (or at least, an attack that he perceives as bad) to be charged with the kind of condescension that we see; I frankly just don't think he would have gone through the effort of faking that condescension as scum, and I don't think he would have been able to do it convincingly enough to match what I'm seeing from him.<br><br>I also just disagree with putting no stock in meta, but I don't want this post to be entirely a long theory argument.<br><br>Will respond to the rest of this later."}

Scum needed 3 or 4 mislynches to win this game, and with at least 2 people I can think of who are unlikely to be lynched ever it's strange to go for Maria over them, or even over people like myself, Grendel, or Implosion if we're all town. It could have been made to implicate boring or Dierfire but as everyone and their mother has pointed out it'd be pretty minor and hardly worth the value of a dead nulltown over a dead hardtown. <br><br>Looking at Maria's ISO, either one of them is really scum, more likely boring than Dierfire in my opinion, or MariaR is 5/5 in her townreads in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8403751#p8403751\" class=\"postlink\">#751</a>. I'm inclined to believe the latter regardless of if the former is true. Cry WIFOM but you want but you only WIFOM if you think you're more likely to win because of it. This kill doesn't make sense if other, more town players are on the right track. nn30, Shadow, and PP line up nicely with my reads, Eager is flipped, and Grendel isn't a stretch. It seems unlikely for any of them to kill her if they're scum. I think they're all town, Grendel being the one I'm least sure on.<br><br>LUV probably needs to be strung up. I still don't like the quantity-over-quality posts early in the game and that flop was awful. This explanation in particular seems really unlikely to me: <blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8429617#p8429617\" class=\"postlink\">post 1633</a>, Lil Uzi Vert wrote:</cite>Also, my case on Shadow was looking like it was never going to be taken seriously, so I decided to pressure my newly found scum read on Snake.</div></blockquote>Does scumreading both Snake and Shadow yesterday make sense to anyone? It doesn't to me. I still need to reread him some more, and especially find other games to see if he's always like this, but for now he's a great spot to park my vote.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: LUV</span><br><br>Boring got mostly a free pass from me later in the day yesterday due to implosion/Maria/eager being the ones leading on her but 2 of these have flipped town and 1 is no longer a power scumread. She's earned a spot at the top of my reread queue along with LUV.<br><br>As a final note I don't like the record keeping on who believed the 2 town ascetics. We had a wide variety of views on the ascetic claims-from me believing either both were town or only Shadow was to Shadow's adamant belief that eager had to be scum. Assuming only 3 mafia and no third party that wagon had at least 4 town, and more likely than not 5 or 6. What to believe about the ascetics is definitely a lot easier to fake than faking reads on players outside them-I think it's a red herring and don't like looking too deeply into it."}

I also thought either Maria or implosion might be a buddy. Obviously, eager and Maria have flipped town, which left me to re-evaluate. I still think there has to be at least one scum on my wagon, and that it leaves implosion, gamma, and nn30 as the scum pool. I don't think Gamma is scum, but if Grendel's right, I'm basing my assumption on something NAI. I don't think nn30 is scum, because even his conf.bias issues seemed towny. I really try not to OMGUS, so I want to take my time on implosion, but he's the POE candidate at the moment. <br><br>That's why I set it aside and started looking elsewhere.

It could have been made to implicate boring or Dierfire but as everyone and their mother has pointed out it'd be pretty minor and hardly worth the value of a dead nulltown over a dead hardtown. <br><br>Looking at Maria's ISO, either one of them is really scum, more likely boring than Dierfire in my opinion, or MariaR is 5/5 in her townreads in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8403751#p8403751\" class=\"postlink\">#751</a>. I'm inclined to believe the latter regardless of if the former is true. Cry WIFOM but you want but you only WIFOM if you think you're more likely to win because of it. This kill doesn't make sense if other, more town players are on the right track. nn30, Shadow, and PP line up nicely with my reads, Eager is flipped, and Grendel isn't a stretch. It seems unlikely for any of them to kill her if they're scum. I think they're all town, Grendel being the one I'm least sure on.<br><br>LUV probably needs to be strung up. I still don't like the quantity-over-quality posts early in the game and that flop was awful. This explanation in particular seems really unlikely to me: <blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8429617#p8429617\" class=\"postlink\">post 1633</a>, Lil Uzi Vert wrote:</cite>Also, my case on Shadow was looking like it was never going to be taken seriously, so I decided to pressure my newly found scum read on Snake.</div></blockquote>Does scumreading both Snake and Shadow yesterday make sense to anyone? It doesn't to me. I still need to reread him some more, and especially find other games to see if he's always like this, but for now he's a great spot to park my vote.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: LUV</span><br><br>Boring got mostly a free pass from me later in the day yesterday due to implosion/Maria/eager being the ones leading on her but 2 of these have flipped town and 1 is no longer a power scumread. She's earned a spot at the top of my reread queue along with LUV.<br><br>As a final note I don't like the record keeping on who believed the 2 town ascetics. We had a wide variety of views on the ascetic claims-from me believing either both were town or only Shadow was to Shadow's adamant belief that eager had to be scum. Assuming only 3 mafia and no third party that wagon had at least 4 town, and more likely than not 5 or 6. What to believe about the ascetics is definitely a lot easier to fake than faking reads on players outside them-I think it's a red herring and don't like looking too deeply into it.</div></blockquote><br><br>I don't see how I haven't made it clear why I started scum reading Snake towards the end of Day 1. Why are you implying that I was scum reading Snake for the majority of the day?"}

I assume therefore that you find Lil Uzi Vert more suspicious than the most suspicious player who voted for you (presumptively implosion, otherwise specify the player)?</div></blockquote><br>Obviously, at the time, I thought eager was scum. I also thought either Maria or implosion might be a buddy. Obviously, eager and Maria have flipped town, which left me to re-evaluate. I still think there has to be at least one scum on my wagon, and that it leaves implosion, gamma, and nn30 as the scum pool. I don't think Gamma is scum, but if Grendel's right, I'm basing my assumption on something NAI. I don't think nn30 is scum, because even his conf.bias issues seemed towny. I really try not to OMGUS, so I want to take my time on implosion, but he's the POE candidate at the moment. <br><br>That's why I set it aside and started looking elsewhere. Regardless of that development, I think LUV is scum, and his flat response didn't help. Yesterday, the only thing that made me doubt his scumminess was that as scum, it would have been all too easy for him to hop on my wagon and save eager. Now, knowing eager is town, he looks worse again, as all he needed was for someone to be at L-1.</div></blockquote><br><br>What was exactly flat about my response? You sound like you were having doubts about Eager being scum and if so, why didn't you state you were when I declared intent? We are all to blame for what happened Day 1 but no one seems to feel remorseful about it at all."}

I'm inclined to believe the latter regardless of if the former is true. Cry WIFOM but you want but you only WIFOM if you think you're more likely to win because of it. This kill doesn't make sense if other, more town players are on the right track. nn30, Shadow, and PP line up nicely with my reads, Eager is flipped, and Grendel isn't a stretch. It seems unlikely for any of them to kill her if they're scum. I think they're all town, Grendel being the one I'm least sure on.<br> </div></blockquote><br><br>I wasn't gonna say it so early, but my pet theory currently is that scum killed off the Eager wagon to prevent their buddies on that wagon from being PoE later. This of course means that I'm thinking that scum will keep killing off that wagon to make narrowing things down harder. Also I the most scum kills tend to have their own pattern to them dependent to the team. Unfortunately its hard to divine it until later into the game. This theory would mean that I'm expecting two scum on the Eager wagon, with the third scum being off. Also, I predict that the scum off the wagon is the one setting themselves up to go deep. <br><br>There is also the possibility that scum thought MariaR was PR laying low or some such.  <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>boring wrote:</cite>@Grendel, what are your thoughts on PP and LUV?</div></blockquote><br><br>Pengiun has been <strike>flying</strike> <span style=\"font-style: italic\">I mean swimming</span> under the radar so far. His, \"lets just lynch him already\", mentality could have scum intent. My original feelings for hard scum reading him have become pretty stale since it seems more then a few people feel his reactions to me were more likely to come from town back on D1. I definitely dislike his play, and I do think he is a viable scum. Not sure how I feel about Zoronos leading the wagon though. Zoronos has been an active voice, but many of his stances that he doesn't back up with a vote, or an aggressive push come off to me as middling, and I just don't trust him. ei I don't want to support a wagon founded by a null-scum slot.  <br><br>Luv is all over the place and I'm having trouble pacing him. I definitely didn't like his hammer, or the unnatural transitions in his reads. I can't help feeling like it is all to easy though.<br><br>I could vote either if it meant pushing a lynch through EoD.

Alas.<br><br>One thing I'll mention that I've been mulling over in my head for a while now... it seems like the eager voters can be vaguely split into two piles: those who voted him because of shadow's claim (which includes shadow and boring) and those who voted him for other reasons, presumably mostly for his reaction to the claim and subsequent play (which might be the majority of or all of the rest of the wagon, not sure). The first group presumably voted for eager because they found two town ascetics unlikely or impossible... so they should now be suspicious of shadow for his claim, right? Ultimately shadow shouldn't be suspicious of himself obviously, and boring has expressed a strong townread on shadow which was also part of the basis of the eager scumread. But if she was confident enough that shadow's claim was <span style=\"font-style: italic\">actually</span> a <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">counter</span>claim - that is, that there can't be two town ascetics - shouldn't she be questioning her shadow read? She was so confident in shadow's claim countering eager's that eager shot from 2nd townread to 1st scumread. And yes, she says that townread came entirely from his claim. But did she not even entertain the possibility that both claims were town? And if so why is she even entertaining it now? She quickly criticized eager for jumping to the possibility of two town ascetics instead of challenging shadow, even when she herself had a very strong townread on shadow... it seems reasonable that she should have seen it as possible or even likely, if eager was town, for him to think that. <br><br>This is sort of stream-of-consciousness.

Tone does vary based on style and mood; it also varies based on mindset, and it varies based on the actual thoughts going on in someone's head in a way that is often more difficult to convincingly fake than actual brute content.

Take for example you (Zoronos) criticizing me for attacking based on tone, and calling it scummy. If you meta me, you will find very objective proof that I do, in fact, do such things as town. You can find games where I have made arguments as town based on tone. That very simple, undisputable meta fact means that calling a point I've made scummy based on tone is inaccurate, unless you can show a trend where I don't do it frequently in my towngames and do do it frequently in my scumgames. That's the simplest application of meta, and also probably the least disputable IMO - using meta to show a simple fact that a player does do something as some alignment, and that they do it frequently as that alignment, so that it can't be accurately used as a tell that the player isn't that alignment.<br><br>My use of meta on PP is, admittedly, much shakier. It's based on a single game, in a significantly different context. That context does matter; it might be more likely for PP to display this kind of behavior as scum in this game because it's not a newbie game, or because the person he's arguing with isn't a newbie game IC. But based on the scum play I saw in that game, the tactics he'd have had to be employing as scum when he talked to Grendel just don't seem like his style; the way he was condescending is not like the way he was argumentative towards me. I think that him being condescending towards Grendel in the way that he was would have required thought processes and a way of looking at this game that I just don't think PP would be capable of given what I saw of his scumgame. Or, at the very least, I am confident that the condescension was not faked, and I think that genuine condescension in that case is indicative that he was town disgruntled by someone saying something that he saw as really stupid.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Zoronos wrote:</cite>Are you scum reading Boring / Dier here?<br></div></blockquote><br>boring obviously yes.

His posts from last night were lots of theory, and argumentation with other players, but none of those arguments were part of offensive scum cases. There was some defensive arguments, and some \"You're playing bad\" but no focus on finding scum. That's what bothers me about Implosion. <br>You say \"On the other hand, he might not be scum\" which is kinda true for every player in this game. Which side do you think is more likely?

I recall Zoronos having markedly little to sat about Gamma aside from \"mad\" voting him, then after unvoting throwing a light scum read Gamma's way. I don't really feel like going back to check his iso to confirm this though that's just how I remember it. Lastly, If Zoronos felt my case was cognizant then why was he not more interested in the prospect of scum Gamma? He was entertaining it earlier after all. <br><br>- I'm not opening to considering any scum teams featuring Penguin and Zoronos together, the same for ImplosionXboring, GammaxPenguin, and boringxLUV.

Their interactions looks less like sorting, and more like distancing imo.<br><br>-Recently Gamma's \"OPPERTUNISTIC VOTE\" on LUV looks like some heavy scum distancing to me. I haven't really checked their history in a while, but Gamma is in a position where he wants to distances as hard and as fast as he can from his buddies due to his impending lynch. <br><br>-The way the Penguin Power handles LUV feels off to me.

Doing so would box her in and defeat her, \u201cscum on my wagon\u201d theory. She had herself set up today to scum hunt off the wagon that formed on her yesterday. By killing off that wagon she reduces her mislynch options, and she is forced to back track at the start of the day. I don\u2019t see why boring would intentionally botch her plans for day play, and create more work for herself. AS scum she\u2019d want as few contradictions in her play as she could get, the kill last night would not help this. It doesn\u2019t get me as much as the previous point, but were i come from many scum are scared to strike down one of their most vocal attackers N1. Not saying that scum don\u2019t here, but it still takes a ballzy scum player to pull a kill like that because it _will_ draw attention to them. <br><br>If she were scum last night\u2019s kill must have been with another players benefit in mind. What I\u2019m thinking is that if boring were scum she isn\u2019t getting set up to go deep, which means at least one of these three things. 1) That she isn\u2019t a scum PR 2) She is the least town read member of her team 3) She is not the leader of the scum lords. (2) has scary implications i don\u2019t feel like considering right now. (3) points to Zoronos as scum since Implosion makes no sense with Boring. <br><br>A. <br>You lack of a vote or memorable aggression on Implosion's slot makes the back and forth between your interactions look like two dudes just having a regular debate that isn't furthering a read for you. The only reason that comes to my mind as to why this could be so it that it is meant to be conflict taken at face value. That the two of you are just distancing. Also, if an Implosion wagon comes up in future and you aren't on it you'd better believe I'm going to make this an issue. <br><br>B.<br>If you had Gamma as a town lean D1, why would you ever vote him?<br>When you talked about how  scum are hiding behind bad play, were you not referring to Gamma?"}

I'm afraid to risk another TvT day when there are 2-3 other scum running around. His posts feel scummy. His big-picture is scummy. When it comes to inferring motivation, I'm falling a little short.

However, it's really frustrating because from my perspective you're jumping into holes over and over.<br><br>I layed out my reasons for Gamma being town back on D1, if you are too lazy to find them in ISO, the basics was that he was playing actively anti-charistmatically, but wasn't using those objections to drive a scum case. Basically, he was playing in a fashion that made himself easier to lynch and that was likely to induce prejudice, which is against the scum win-con.<br>For the D2 case, he's basically just playing like an idiot - His play right now is in no way contributing to a scum win con. He's not playing to survive, at least not constructively. He's under pressure and is flailing, but is making absolutely no effort to conceal that flail. If he were scum and my train were the mislynch (or boring's), he'd have been massively incentivized to vote park and then not participate further. Instead, he painted a massive target on his back by acting loud and crazy.<br>If he's scum, then his scum game plan is awful and makes no sense. It looks the same to me as the behavior of Eager at the end of D1.<br>So yeah, I don't really want to lynch him."}

I mean, he's got one vote on him (mine). Lurking is a strong scum strategy because there's nothing to hang a case off of.  It's really hard to get people to agree to lynch the guy just not posting because there's almost nothing in his history to grab and say \"This is a scummy post\". Nobody is paying attention to him, or at least he's nobody's TOP SCUM (other than mine), so I'd say it's advancing a scum win con great. He's being forgotten, and he's not contributing to town. He's not collaborating with his town reads (does he have any? I couldn't really say), he's not investigating.<br><br>I explained my D1 read in greater depth earlier, it's in my ISO if you want to go find it. I certainly don't know how he 'always plays' but it strikes me as a really stupid way to play scum to start by immediately offending town players.

I think her townreads either all were town or only one isn't. One of them has flipped it and nn30/Shadow are both likely town as well. There's literally no other reason to kill her when if they weren't, she's protecting scum and is a candidate for a mislynch later down the road. I think in general it points more towards boring being scum. I think not making NK speculation is a big mistake-every kill is made for a reason-out of perception of a threat, out of a desire to misdirect, or some combination thereof. My biggest strength as a player is playing the WIFOM game and winning.<br><br>boring's is a difficult read. <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8427761#p8427761\" class=\"postlink\">#1609</a> I think brings up a good point on implosion but you don't have to be scum to find a good point. The frustration is hard to see through, last time I reread it I could see it being legitimate. I liked <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8409039#p8409039\" class=\"postlink\">#1165</a> at the time but now I read things like this and just want to vote her for it: <blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8409039#p8409039\" class=\"postlink\">post 1165</a>, boring wrote:</cite>I'm frankly baffled by my wagon, or that it's lasted this long. I'd congratulate scum, but I don't think they've earned it.</div></blockquote> What came after was better but I feel her posts are always going to come off the wrong way. However, that doesn't mean I'm wrong. The MariaR kill is a really, really good reason to vote her, especially if Gamma's report on Implosion is legitimate. She is my top fallback pick for a vote today if LUV doesn't pan out.<br><br>I still want an LUV vote for reasons already explained. It's not changing. <span class=\"noboldsig\">You don't lie about plagiarizing someone else's reasoning as town.</span><br><br>Implosion's posts are getting worse but he's town if Gamma is and I'm glad he was investigated. I was scumreading him again but traitor's page says that in normal games it must turn up guilty and I can't find any others in the list that return town as mafia. I typed up the next part before I went back and saw this but I'll leave it anyway. His posts have had me thinking he's just making up plausible reasons for his reads and not even bothering to interrogate himself for whether or not they make sense. The first part of <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8444251#p8444251\" class=\"postlink\">#1895</a> in particular reads to me as either a fundamental misrepresentation or misunderstanding of what scum do and don't do in general. <br><br>I think Gamma is real. I really believe the claim. It'd be one thing if he kind of talked to Implosion Day 1 and then started today with a brief interaction but he literally <span style=\"font-style: italic\">never mentioned implosion once</span> and then all of a sudden seemed to townread him. Either he planned on doing this from the start or it's legit and I lean the latter.The one thing I agree on in Implosion's post is that the read forgetting is a towntell but I would phrase it as less concern for keeping up a facade rather than less concern for his life. Finding a completed town game of his in 154 pages of posts was difficult so I just went back to the first one, he looked more consistent read-wise in it but he also has noticeably grown as a player and I don't put much faith in that. This is a bit less solid but based off that game I'd be willing to be he'd rather try and be consistent as scum than roll the dice on being townread anyway. Either way, he makes 47 posts a day and I'm not going to blame him if he's getting muddled as town. I'm not voting him or Implosion today. If they're both alive later I'll reconsider. If he flips scum I will almost certainly instavote Implosion and LUV after.<br><br>Rereading Zoronos is my next project, his early Day 1 was pretty town but recent posts tell me otherwise. Telling us not to NK speculate and not meta is a big negative as the value in both is obvious. If boring is scum, his chance of being so additionally shoots way up. For now, <span class=\"noboldsig\">more people need to vote LUV.</span> Even if I'm wrong and Gamma's scum we'll find out later. Giving implosion a pass by way of Gamma, the order I'd lynch in right now goes something like LUV, boring, Zoronos, gap, then Dierfire, Gamma, Penguin Power, Grendel, then everyone else.<br><br>As a reminder it is imperative that you vote in a <span class=\"noboldsig\">relevant way</span> at the end of the day as town, <span class=\"noboldsig\">even if you are sure your vote is scum.</span> Your second or third choice of vote is better than the scum's first choice. If your vote does not gain traction, it means switch to someone else. Do not throw away your vote by either not voting or by voting someone you know will not be lynched."}

When I last compiled a reads list, I had a note in there that said he couldn't be scum with SS (and I think one other player, but I forget who at this point), who was my other main read, and I think that's borne out at this point because I doubt SS is scum running the play he's running.</div></blockquote>The last time you mentioned any reason to think he was town was 1000 posts back in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8401485#p8401485\" class=\"postlink\">#580</a>. Every post in between these two you just gave more reason to scumread him only to give a weak obligatory post about why you still weren't sure. You scumread Implosion all game and apparently were pining for someone else to agree, yet you couldn't even be the second vote on him, instead preferring to build up to hammering Eager from <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8409075#p8409075\" class=\"postlink\">#1168</a> on."}

I've also defended myself against her case and she refuses to acknowledge that and is just asking anyone and everyone to vote for me. Prism is doing the same thing, even after I pointed out the problem with his case. <br><br>Since I believe Gamma's claim, Impolsion is confirmed town but I don't understand why he has made no effort to read me which makes me question everything.

First, as Zoronos becomes more likely to be Town, my confidence in POE from earlier increases, which makes Lil Uzi Vert more likely to be Mafia at baseline. Second, the vote for Zoronos makes more sense from a Mafia player who claimed Doctor than from an actual Town Doctor (the latter has little reason to suspect that a Mafia player wants him lynched immediately rather than killed by Night, particularly at the cost of countering the claim).<br>I could think of two potential reasons to leave Lil Uzi Vert alive. First, if if Lil Uzi Vert is actually a Town Doctor, it would potentially allow Gamma Emerald another action. However, I'm inclined to think that the combination of Doctor and Cop, besides being rare, would likely have a Mafia role to counter this interaction. Therefore I think that this is not a good reason to leave Lil Uzi Vert alive. It does open one other long shot; if we lynch a player who flips with a role like Mafia Strongman or Mafia Roleblocker, the Doctor claim would be much more believable.<br><br>CUT: I hadn't factored in the Ascetic roles, which I suppose would be a weak version of a Strongman kill (allows the Mafia to kill certain players regardless of protection, but isn't much help if they want to lynch those players and/or kill other players)."}

I honestly had checked out way before I got ran up. Truth is, I don't know what's wrong with the way I play because I've never gotten mislynched before until I've played on here and even then, and so far, I haven't had my play read as lynch bait except the games I've been with you two. <br><br><br><span style=\"font-size: 200%; line-height: 116%;\">Town: Diefire, Grendal, nn30, Zoro<br>Null: boring, Eager, Gamma, Maria, Prism<br>Scum - Penguin, Shadow</span><br><br><br>boring - While she does ask questions, she doesn't seem like she is actively trying to solve the game and her votes all seem like a stretch or too convenient. I don't know how to put my feelings about her into the words but I can't shake this vibe from her. I think it's mainly her vote on Zoro, which read more to me as nitpicking about inconsistencies rather than looking for scum. <br><br>Diefire - I liked every single one of his observations he's made so far and agree with almost all of them except the likelihood of Gamma and PP being a team. I'm not saying it's not a possibility, I just don't try to look for teams early on in the game and I like to focus on one person at a time once I feel 90% sure they're scum. <br><br>Eager - He's been very quiet ever since the claim and all he's been doing is throwing out town reads at awkward times without explaining them. He also seems to really have it out for boring for what I assume to be from things he's heard through the grapevine or their previous games together. For now, I'm not seeing what makes him so widely town read but he also hasn't done anything particularly scummy, just odd.<br><br>Gamma - Gamma strikes me as a good dude who's very eager to play mafia and seems to enjoy the game a ton. But, his defense or his use of meta in regards to my play has honestly gotten him into a bind here to the point where I wished he hadn't done it. He doesn't seem to have any bad intentions whenever I read the tone of his posts but I can't argue against the cases presented against him but for now, my gut says he isn't scum.<br><br>Grendal - Outside of the RQS, I've liked a lot of the questions he's asks and I think he's trying his hardest to understand the thoughts and motives behind what everyone is saying and doing. His fixation with Gamma is a little weird, but I understand that they're friends and feeling confident that you aren't being doped by a friend can definitely help go a long way into building that town block Snake was talking about. <br><br>Implosion - I'm still waiting for him to give his thoughts on me but for now I'm not sure what to think of him because while he's been the only player to have voted for me without mentioning why, I've really liked how he's defended himself and presenting his cases.<br><br>Maria - Very hard to read to me but that's mainly because I feel we play similar.<br><br>nn30 - Is actively poking and scum hunting. I like this guy a lot<br><br>Penguin - As I've stated earlier, I am pretty wary of Penguin, especially after how hypocritical he's been about Grendal's RQS. He harps on contributions but I don't see much from him other than relentless attacking for things that are very NAI such as those RQS and inactivity. Like his posts don't make me feel like I should be breaking my neck for this game.<br><br>Prism - Just subbed in. Nothing to go off of.<br><br>Shadow - Like Penguin, I don't get the sense that he's really contributing, he's very quick to just jump on things and doesn't really have sound reasoning for jumping on said things. At first I thought he was just a VI, but he keeps saying that this game is easy or it's almost solved, which baffles me and makes me uneasy. <br><br>Zoro - Outside of his strong dislike for RQS, I get a strong town vibe from him because he truly seems to believe what he stands for and what he's saying. I truly think he's only being scum read because his play is not seen as someone who has to adjust to the way the site plays now.</div></blockquote><br><br>equal distribution of scum buddies makes more sense than not.<br>In the town tier I'm still confident about my DF, Grendel town reads.

The ones opting to town read me will dig their heels in when I, or they, are questioned about their stance. Clearly  Zoronos is falling into the first category. He insists RQS is pro-scum, throws out a light scum read my way, but doesn\u2019t show any desire to push said scum read. In fact if appears that he is back tracking in his next post. If in this instance Zoronos is scum there is a good chance that he is the \u2018leader\u2019 of his posse, and that his scum buddies are less experienced players then he is.

The bolded sentence slightly parallels my own interactions with Zoronos this game. 1) Zoro is absolutely being the voice of reason this game and 2) he's corrected my play a few times. This is interesting and makes me want to re-read Zoro. It's possible that Zoro / Grendel are a scum team and Zoro told Grendel his play style in scum chat - which is reflected here. A Zoro/Grendel team is possible to me since neither of them are in my hard town category at the moment. <br><br>Something else from his RQS analysis - of the 3 dead townies, Grendel had  2 of them pegged as town from RQS and one null. Of the dead scum, he had a null here as well. The lack of inaccuracy on these four is interesting. If Grendel flips scum at some point refer to this post - it may be useful.

Lil is non contributing and anti town, but his play is a largely null tell for me because he did this exact same thing as town last time I played with him. Heck I, as scum, pushed to get Vert lynched with the same reason that Penguin is here. That Vert is \u201cfence sitty and his lack of stances make him scum lordz\u201d. Lil is a great wagon for scum!Penguin because he can push this wagon through with little consequence once Vert were to flip town.</span>  <br><br>His move to Gamma isn\u2019t much better because Gamma is known for taking things at face value. Like Gamma is hard town reading, and defended me because I opened with RQS. This is because I played a game as scum where I didn\u2019t open with RQS. When the reason I didn\u2019t open had more to do with me subbing into a game with 20+ pages then my alignment. It\u2019s the same thing with Vert, Gamma has an experience with town!Vert being fence sitty and non-contributory, so he thinks Vert is town here. Penguin\u2019s biggest reason for voting Gamma is because Gamma tr Vert, everything else seems like that Penguin seems to find scum about Gamma looks like pretty normal Gamma play too honestly. <br><br>Basically Penguin has only pushed for wagons on easy players. <br><br>I also don\u2019t care for announcing I\u2019m town without explaining why. All the more awkward considering that he seemed to think i was scum, (or bad town), just one page earlier. I only posted a couple thought in between those points. I don't see how Penguin would have come to that conclusion as quickly as he did based solely on that. All I really did was defend my RQS, and tell Penguin that calling me \"scum, or bad town\" is an ugly knee jerk reaction. I could totally see Penguin as scum backing off because he decided I wasn't an easy lynch.</div></blockquote><br><br>I think this singlehandedly removes Grendel/Penguin/LUV as a scum team. As scum I don't see myself putting myself and my two buddies in the same post with this much meat in it.<br><br>I've bolded Grendel's defense of LUV. At the time of this defense there were zero votes on LUV - making the likelihood of Grendel attempting to defend his scum partner higher than if LUV was about to be lyched. Relevantly, this also came after LUV's (in hindsight) terrible 246 where LUV fails to provide proof that he was trying to solve the game and instead summarizes what has already happened. Grendel still chose to defend him.

Quit nit picking. I can have bad games, btw. I have had games were I did great nailing scum working off of RQS, then wagon analysis, and into night analysis after a couple of days. Once I get to the late game I review my team hunts, to find which connections stayed true based off of later flips. You\u2019re saying based off of one game were things went really sour I should rework the entire way I play? That\u2019s a crap thing to say.

I\u2019m actually very against bussing as scum, and would have never done it. I believe that mafia is a team game, and that bussing a buddy is playing like a survivor. I want to work with a team to meet an end goal, and the idea of ditching people to get temporay town read doesn't seem worth it to me. In my case the benefits of bussing, never outwieght the benefits of trying to keep the team together. Like, I\u2019m actually really wary of going in deep as scum by myself. I suck at One v one, and most likely wouldn\u2019t be able to keep up the motivation needed to power through lylo. So I wouldn\u2019t help town lynch scum because I recognize that means that I have to fight harder later on. If I were scum this game I would have dug my heels in somewhere else, or lurked out EoD without voting LUV. I also, for the record, don\u2019t keep scum buddies as back pocket reads. I've kept LUV in null-scum then entire game. Keeping my scum buddy as null-scum would have pout me in a postion where I had to lynch LUV. I wouldn't have done that. <br><br>But knowing you. You'll just write this off as \"Scum self metaing\". I don\u2019t care at this point though.

Broken record time.<br><br>I do not buy at all that LUV's scumflip implies boring-town. <br><br>I think the biggest point I want to make here is that either boring or nn is really REALLY likely scum. On day one, during the time when boring and eager were competing as the two main wagons, LUV heavily (at least, relative to his volume of posting) pushed the shadow-scum narrative. He eventually could easily have gone to either wagon, but chose to vote for eager.

The boring wagon has the nice property here of being all-town, with the possible exception of nn. So if nn is town I just don't see LUV going for this awkward turnaround hammer on eager unless he was trying to avoid bussing boring. In other words if nn is town, then the boring wagon was an all-town wagon that scum actively avoided by choosing to flip on eager rather than boring (again, he was pushing both of them as town up to this point). <br><br>On d2, I asked LUV for his thoughts on boring, to which he cited his rhetoric from d1 about not buying the case on her and saying he'd need more time to figure it out. Between <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8442954#p8442954\">1836</a> (which vaguely implies he still has a townread on boring I think, and he doesn't say anything about scumreading her before it either) and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8454253#p8454253\">2089</a> (where he all but calls boring his strongest scumread!) he mentions her a couple times but none significantly. His play towards boring looks like freaking textbook scum who was afraid to bus or distance but decided that it would be good to distance before he went down when it seemed like there was a strong chance he was going to be the lynch.<br><br>As for boring hard-bussing LUV, it really was not in a way that I think lends her a lot of town credence; on d1 she consistently pushed eager and cited LUV as her fallback if we weren't voting in the CCs. Hardly an all-out bus on a partner like some people have described it, as far as I can tell... that's a perfectly typical scum d1 distance if she is scum. Vote a townie fos a buddy. It's pretty much the oldest trick in the book. By d2 LUV was already pretty set to have a lot of pressure on him. She gets some credit for pushing him but... well, she <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8417174#p8417174\">said it best herself</a>: <br><blockquote><div><cite>boring wrote:</cite>I think LUV has been lurky, beetlegeuse-ish, and unoriginal throughout the game.

He was lurking. He was being actively scummy with refusing to commit to either major wagon and then showing up at the last second and awkwardly declaring intent and hammering. Bussing LUV is absolutely sensible play from scum, especially scum who was already distancing from him... and again, distancing from a partner on d1 is standard play.<br><br>I really think though that the biggest thing is that I just find it hard to believe that all six of these names are town:<br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>boring (5): eagerSnake, MariaR, implosion, Gamma Emerald, nn30</div></blockquote><br>and I think nn's play today is pretty towny.

I'm going to have this mental block until we lynch boring or I see any reason at all to townread her. I'd love if someone can justify why her distancing from LUV was strong enough to have been unlikely to come from scum."}

But I forgot that you\u2019re new to the site, and it is more a sign of your newness here then straight up scum opportunistic play. Primarily because as scum I don\u2019t think you\u2019d unvote, then put all this effort into thinking about the game state as a whole. If you were scum I\u2019d imagine that you would be perfectly happy to ride me to my death. <br><br>I had some serous paranoia about you over the course of night two, but I\u2019m pretty over it now. It was how you went on that tangent at EoD yesterday about serial killers. As a rule of thumb I find players that are paranoid about third party roles with night kill capabilities to be a scum tell. Mainly since a SK would be a threat to scum during the night, and can be leashed by town if found out making them as dangers as a vigilante to the mafia. I guess it sounds silly in this context, but it\u2019s a legitimate tell on the other site I play at... I hope Gamma isn\u2019t taking notes from the dead thread. <br><br>There is also the matters of POE on the boring wagon when I came into today, but I\u2019ve lost my initial confidence that boring is town due to associative to another player I think is scum now. <br><br>I also don\u2019t think that effort necessarily equals alignment, but I do think that faking the effort you have throughout the game is reflective of somebody with a lot more experience the you seem to actually have. I briefly entertained the idea that you could have more experience then you let on. I recall you playing lots of different games of deception for fun in you submitted RQS answers. But all the tangents you hit throughout the game sound a lot more like somebody who is newer to the game, and in interested in how things work, then somebody experienced. Even the sk thing in retrospect."}

Though I find the order a bit weird. <br><br>-With the usage of the scum pt it is not unreasonable that Shadow could have plotted out his counter claim in advance.

It also gives him an excuse to spend the whole day tunneling Eager, and be justified by the outcome regardless what Eager flips. He do say this as town, but it'd be an awfully convenit stance to take as scum sense he can look like aggressive town while not actually being aggressive towards other players. So he gets no back lash for statements like this.  <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8410849#p8410849\" class=\"postlink\">post 1344</a>, Shadow_step wrote:</cite>Hmm I got my facts wrong.

Usually something directed at Shadow too. Also Shadow is once again painting the mod as the scape goat.

Also nobody pointing out some of these things means that everybody has written off Shadow as town. Which imo is a big mistake that I too was a part of yesterday. The entire purpose of a powerful D1 scum gambit is to rack up enough town cred to slide into the endgame. This is exactly what Shadow is doing.<br><br>You know, I had originally thought that Shadow step was an investigative role given his jump on Gamma at the start of D2 along the lines of \u201cOh yeah, this is scum btw\u201d. I thought that he was softing a guilty, the same way he did at the start of D1 where he remarked how easy the game will be after Eager\u2019s claim. There was also how much attention Shadow gives Maria D1, and her general feelings were that Gamma wasn\u2019t Ob!town like she was expecting him to be. More reasoning I had down in my notes is that two regular townies modified with straight aesthetics modifiers and nothing else, would be really anti town. So I thought that Shadow should be a cop or some such."}

You are right that his play is worthy of a bit more thought in light of the possibility that he's a scum ascetic but I do not think there's any chance that he's scum unless he counterclaimed because he thought it was what he'd do as a town ascetic.

Look, at the end of Day 1, I don't remember who asked me, but I posted (and I'm summarizing, professor) that regardless of the outcome between eager and shadow, LUV was scum. He was largely ignored at that point in the game, and it was before he out-of-the-blue hammered eager. Your premise just doesn't hold water.<br><br>Obviously, that was super scummy. (I don't get why everyone else needed so much damned convincing), and I didn't see much reason to move on from him unless there was no chance that day to lynch him (I don't see the point in ending a day on a vanity wagon, no matter how right you are, unless you're dead set against town's choice).<br><br>Now, I realize that you can argue words till we're both old and wrinkled, but I pushed LUV's wagon as hard as I've ever pushed a wagon. That's what hard means to me. I'm sorry it's not the right wording for you, but didn't I promise you more disappointing wording?

Another possible interpretation is that LUV was reluctant to bus Day 1, he took a hard stance between Eager/Shadow by voting Shadow and wound up just lolhammering Eager so I don't really think being on a wagon that flipped town was the biggest concern.

On the contrary, I'm suggesting that you are <span style=\"font-style: italic\">too intelligent</span> to be surprised by scum's choice of kill given the knowledge that jailing Gamma is a waste of a jail, and that scum can risk one kill-less night. I also think that killing someone who is suspicious of you is a solid play. I see no reason to go on PP-the only questionable thing he's really done is overplay the brash behavior when he realized people townread it. That's scummy, sure, but that's definitely possible as town. If anything right now my second choice would be Grendel-my first impression of his case on Shadow is that he knows he's not winning vs. nn30 and needs a hail mary, especially if you're scum with him. Assuming no two death nights, scum needs at minimum 3 mislynches to win, and they're not going to make themselves. Somebody has to create them, and it's not happening if a red flip comes today.<br><br>I'm not trying to insult your intelligence and I'm sorry if it comes off that way. That said, I think it's more likely that you're playing up your offense just to be more dismissive, because I have actual points I've given, and you're willfully just skipping to taking offense and insulting me. You can be frustrated because it's entirely possible that my theories are <span style=\"font-style: italic\">completely untrue</span>, but acting like they're irrational and impossible is another thing.<blockquote><div><cite>Zoronos wrote:</cite>What is the rest of the case, beyond 'a bunch of town voted for her D1'?<br><br>I guess I'm missing the thrust of the case kinda other than the bussing part but maybe I'm the dumb.</div></blockquote>Only speaking for me but a few of the reasons I'm voting her are:<br>-Maria death<br>-Acknowledging why Gamma wouldn't be jailed but claims to be confused about why he died<br>-Voting LUV with me really doesn't convince me given the timing. LUV did something incredibly scummy and it doesn't take a town to see that. This may be confirmation bias speaking but a lot of her votes both today and other days seem opportunistic, ex. <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8435098#p8435098\" class=\"postlink\">#1763</a> gives the possibility of her switching to Gamma. Kind of hypocritical of me to point out as I've said numerous times to make sure your vote is somewhere it counts, but the <span style=\"font-style: italic\">who it is</span> question is still there.<br>-LUV voting Shadow then quickhammering Eager rather than just voting one of Eager/boring in a natural way to begin with is really strange if they're both town.<br>-Part of it is just me staring blankly at my computer, blankly looking at the names Dierfire/Grendel/boring/PenguinPower, and asking myself who's the most likely scum out of the 4.<br><br>Still trying to make time to reread Grendel/Dierfire but life happens and I'm really busy today and tomorrow.

The only reason I've ever given to townread you is based off Maria's death. In contrast, I've also pointed out that certain posts of yours were bad, and some of them worse yet replying to me without actually reading the original post (which suggests you weren't interested in them to begin with). You've been basically in the middle to bottom half of the game, and I've made it explicit that I intend to vote you today if I can't get boring. If boring is town, you are almost certainly scum by PoE. If boring is scum, you are still a very likely candidate for the partner.<br><br>You didn't even acknowledge repeated announcements for you as a potential alternative lynch, both today and yesterday. I'm not just not whiteknighting you, I'm straight up more on the offense.

I don't think I can lynch her.</div></blockquote><br><br>What do you think of the case on her though? Obviously you believe it to be incorrect - why though?</div></blockquote><br><br>The thing about the boring case is that I feel like she has been in a lot of peoples scum lean for much of the game. In this position its more likely that scum would try to lurk out the pressure. From what I\u2019ve seen boring has been pretty on top of things and actively contributing to the gamestate. The near constant pressure makes me think that town is just being paranoid, thus watching and dissecting boring more than any other player. Also, more than town paranoia there is the chance of mafia taking advantage of this at some point, and into today. <br><br>Things that could possibly point to scum boring look circumstantial, like scum reading her for her unvote to LUV. It seems like she had some doubts about the Doc claim but didn\u2019t want to make a mistake and accidentally flip the town doctor. It was a pretty natural reaction that I don\u2019t think was fake. I don\u2019t wholly understand how LUV\u2019s lack of a counter strike towards boring should paint boring as bussing scum since LUV would want to distance himself from boring, which I don\u2019t really recall happening. I also don't see boring being the hard bussing type, and she was on the LUV wagon for extended periods of time all of D2, even with the existence of an appetizing Gamma wagon was happening on the side. She had multiple times she could of justified leaving the LUV wagon. The only time she unvoted LUV was when he fake claimed, but most people did at the time so...<br><br>I don\u2019t agree with what Eager had as a case on boring. I don\u2019t agree with his tone read on boring being happy with the D1 cc. Or his assurance that boring must be scum based off a lack of action on her wagon early into D1. I mainly believe this to be so because there were people who voiced suspicions, but didn\u2019t scum read her enough to put any more votes down. I think if scum were jumping on boring\u2019s wagon they\u2019d do it when she was the focus of discussion. Lastly, the fact that Penguin is swayed by Eager\u2019s argument now after a whole day goes by looks opportunistic. If he truly thought that Eager was on to something why did he why so long to point this out? <br><br>I still don\u2019t think Maria night kill points towards boring!scum. <br><br>I did wonder when I first thought that shadow is scum if he was hard defending boring because he wouldn\u2019t want another buddy bussed with him being a claimed role and all. But at the same time, if shadow sees that town!boring is today\u2019s lynch he may be trying to put himself in a good light by town reading her."}

That post gives me two reasons to think nn is town:<br><br>-the indignance with which he describes his play as town. This is more of a gut thing, it isn't going to be rigorously justifiable. It does go beyond simply indignance; it feels to me like nn is genuinely trying to work with people to solve the game. His insistence that the people pushing him give cases, his rhetoric towards Zoronos, and so on. <br><br>-his throwing townreads out left and right. If he's scum then the way that he went into today is painting himself into a corner, immediately striking out both pp and boring as likely directions for him to push in going forward. Granted, he did flip on boring now, but in a reasonable way in response to new information which him as scum wouldn't have known would be guaranteed to happen. To generalize he is playing this day very off-the-cuff, throwing reads out and laying his opinions bare for everyone to investigate. Saying he <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8468267#p8468267\">doesn't want to vote Grendel because he's just a counterwagon</a>, then giving <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8468278#p8468278\">real reasons</a> to vote him 7 minutes later. And then saying he got more <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8468347#p8468347\">town pings</a> from Grendel 40 minutes after that. He's responsive. He doesn't have a plan. His play just doesn't feel like scum who's trying to get a person in particular lynched, or avoid lynching anyone else in particular, or try to avoid being lynched himself; his play is just too much a combination of putting himself out there and not having a plan behind it to be scum, I think."}

You're basically saying \"a vote on me has an obvious scum motivation, therefore it was scum-motivated.\" And I'll agree with you on that antecedent; the scum motivation of wanting to chain mislynches on you and eager makes plenty of sense. But the existence of a scum motivation for doing something doesn't mean that scum will do it... and this goes doubly so when there was already another scum doing it and no town (nn and LUV were the only ones voting you for quite a while, and it would be somewhat unusual for two scum to maintain a wagon together on a townie for a long time). <br><br>More to the point, <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Shadow wrote:</cite>Cause I thought eager was scum then.</div></blockquote><br>I could use this by a slightly weaker form of your logic (pushing a mislynch rather than pushing a chain of mislynches) to justify a scumread on you.

He's prided himself on taking a very ambitious, intellectual approach to the game, but regularly stops at the most basic level of speculation. He said he looks forward to matching wits with us, and made ambitious statements like RQS working him but not \"for the masses\" and that he tries to pin the whole scumteam Day 1 collectively rather than focus individuals. Simultaneously, his night kill speculation on Maria's death was \"boring wouldn't make that because it implicates her\" despite that being <span style=\"font-style: italic\">exactly what you would expect a scum defense to be.</span> Several of his stronger townreads have been for things as simplistic as \"draws attention to themselves\".

Notably I remembered this looking at grendel's <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8443114#p8443114\">1847</a> where he lists scum teams that he thinks make sense going off of the wagon, and notably considers himself and nn as town and so based on the assumption that some scum is trying to \"go deep\" reasons that likely either i or zoronos is scum.<br><br>Prism's point that grendel isn't following up with the level of depth that he says he puts into the game is very interesting. The idea of how deep a player will think as town is something that I've been tossing around in my head since a recent hydra game where the subject came up in discussion with my other head. I'm quite curious to see grendel's response to it. I'm also curious to see what grendel thinks of the fact that his high-level analysis in 1847 has more or less fallen flat on its face given that 3/5 of the teams he listed have two people on them between me/zoronos/gamma... and one of the teams contained all three :s. I never read that post in depth until now but it's an almost fanatical level of attempted foresight... trying to call the scumteam based solely on vca and a little soft poe. He says he wants to start with lynching gamma because he's in 4 of them but ignores that i'm in 3 and luv is in 3 and zoronos is in 3 which is really only nominally less. Maybe doesn't ignore it. But it's an awfully convenient excuse, if grendel is scum, to lump me, zoronos, and luv into a \"deal with after we get a flip from gamma\" pile. His vote on luv at end of day 2 feels really awkward, like he's not really enthused about it. Like idk, after making that big deal out of those scumteams and asking his town pile to help comment on his high level speculation he ends the day after gamma is shown to be town on a note of \"eh, i guess a luv lynch works for me\" before adding some more words about the claim being fake. Can't 100% put my finger on this here. It sort of does feel like his thought processes are trailing off more than they should be. which sort of gets at what prism was talking about.<br><br>more to come probably."}

On further consideration, though, I'm not sure that any was needed. If your theory is that Shadow_step has a Mafia Ascetic role, the Roleblocker function is not necessary to explain the decision to kill Gamma Emerald, right? In fact, I'd think that a Mafia team with an Ascetic Roleblocker (and one capable of killing and blocking by night according to the opening post) could get away with either action, whereas a Mafia team with an Ascetic Goon would be more likely to go after the claimed Cop.<br><br>Anyway, I've reviewed the Shadow_step again, and while to a certain degree I agree with the ideas that he has been playing in an unhelpful manner, I think that his claim is more likely to come from a Town Ascetic role than a Mafia Ascetic role.

It also gives him an excuse to spend the whole day tunneling Eager, and be justified by the outcome regardless what Eager flips. He do say this as town, but it'd be an awfully convenit stance to take as scum sense he can look like aggressive town while not actually being aggressive towards other players.

Usually something directed at Shadow too. Also Shadow is once again painting the mod as the scape goat. Maybe it's just me, but shadow has been evading the responsibility for his actions this game, starting with his fake 1-L vote on Pengiun back in Day 1.<br><br>Seeing how the most town thing I had to say about Shadow going into today was his behavior D1 tells me that he has been keeping a low profile since Eager flipped. Also nobody pointing out some of these things means that everybody has written off Shadow as town. Which imo is a big mistake that I too was a part of yesterday. The entire purpose of a powerful D1 scum gambit is to rack up enough town cred to slide into the endgame. This is exactly what Shadow is doing.<br><br>You know, I had originally thought that Shadow step was an investigative role given his jump on Gamma at the start of D2 along the lines of \u201cOh yeah, this is scum btw\u201d. I thought that he was softing a guilty, the same way he did at the start of D1 where he remarked how easy the game will be after Eager\u2019s claim. There was also how much attention Shadow gives Maria D1, and her general feelings were that Gamma wasn\u2019t Ob!town like she was expecting him to be. More reasoning I had down in my notes is that two regular townies modified with straight aesthetics modifiers and nothing else, would be really anti town. So I thought that Shadow should be a cop or some such.</div></blockquote></div></div></div><br>My primary reservations on the Shadow case are, first, if he's scum, he's played one hell of a risky game. Second, I'm prone to serious paranoia sometimes, so I have to question whether I've read too much into these details. <br><br>Yes, Shadow, I think it possible for the scum team to be LUV-Penguin-Shadow."}

Though while the arguments against nn30 are more likely generated by scum than those against Grendel, nn30 worries me a tiny bit, independently. Though, certainly not enough to leap over my already-bursting scum pool. You're next because you've got nothing particularly scummy going on, and you've banked a few towny moves.

In a world where LUV and Shadow are both scum, this means that LUV intentionally engaged with Shadow's hinting at a CC. Unlikely, in my eyes.<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8398438#p8398438\" class=\"postlink\">post 522</a>, Lil Uzi Vert wrote:</cite>Shadow - Like Penguin, I don't get the sense that he's really contributing, he's very quick to just jump on things and doesn't really have sound reasoning for jumping on said things.

I think it's mainly her vote on Zoro, which read more to me as nitpicking about inconsistencies rather than looking for scum. <br></div></blockquote><br>At this time, Eager had 4 votes and Boring was his counter wagon at 3. LUV jumps on the Shadow wagon (which had only 1 vote at the time). People are reading this as LUV avoiding the Boring counterwagon because she's scum but also avoiding the Eager wagon (for some reason). I'm fine with reading it that way but LUV could also just be behaving irrationally. <br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8404642#p8404642\" class=\"postlink\">post 885</a>, Lil Uzi Vert wrote:</cite><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Shadow</span><br>If both of you are town we are seriously fucked.</div></blockquote><br>LUV soft defends Boring again.<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8405532#p8405532\" class=\"postlink\">post 1048</a>, Lil Uzi Vert wrote:</cite>I don't get the case for boring, she's new to site so it's possible she has never seen scum act like Shadow had acted early on in the game, she stated reasons for why she found Eager's claiming terrible and she called him out for coasting. I can see why she voted for Eager.</div></blockquote><br>And again. At this point in my ISO dive, my thought is this: do scum really defend one another this much? I'm leaning towards unlikely. <br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8410198#p8410198\" class=\"postlink\">post 1303</a>, Lil Uzi Vert wrote:</cite>Shadow still reads the same to me but I'm willing to move my vote with enough convincing. I still don't buy the case on boring, well I don't buy it enough to believe she's the correct lynch for today.</div></blockquote><br>Another instance of Boring not liking LUV on D1. First off, bussing is bad scum play unless it's necessary. At this point in time, there was no foregone conclusion that LUV would be dead on D2 - ergo bussing him isn't necessary. She even says 'regardless of Eager's flip, LUV could be scum.' She follows this up on D2 by pushing him. This feels towny to me.<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8416724#p8416724\" class=\"postlink\">post 1452</a>, boring wrote:</cite>I would like to lynch eager today, but if it's absolutely not going to happen, I'd be willing to settle for LUV. He's the most probable scum when I look outside the CC-related wagons. By that, I mean it seems like regardless of eager's flip, LUV could be scum. I admit that part of my reasoning is that he keeps trying to push S_s, which is making zero sense to me. That, and his eagerness to accept bizarre theories just to keep the S_s suspicions going.</div></blockquote><br>Again with the reasoning to scum read LUV on D1. I'll forgive her for not pushing it harder - the Shadow v. Eager mess on D1 derailed everyone else too. If she is scum who just outright gave town her plan, bravo. That's some hilarious stuff there. I'm not inclined to read it this way because <span class=\"noboldsig\">I don't think planning to bus from the get go is a good scum plan</span>.<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8417174#p8417174\" class=\"postlink\">post 1487</a>, boring wrote:</cite>I think LUV has been lurky, beetlegeuse-ish, and unoriginal throughout the game. It's really easy to float to day 1 or day 2 in order to give your teammates something to bus, and that matches his behavior. When he was getting heat, he basically disappeared until people moved onto someone else. <br>As far as who is more likely to come up with (and follow) crazy theories, I think it's pretty individual. Some people have wild imaginations and are prone to conspiracy. Some people aren't. I can see such a person coming up with something crazy as town or scum (perhaps more likely as town, but how would they know it's crazy as scum if they think it's perfectly sane when they're town). I think scum (or insanely conf.biased town) is more likely to pretend to buy into someone else's  crazy theory hoping it'll stick.</div></blockquote><br>First post of D2 - scum reads LUV. <br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8425328#p8425328\" class=\"postlink\">post 1555</a>, boring wrote:</cite>I'm still suspicious of LUV. My read on him was independent of the wagons yesterday. The rest, I'm trying to piece together.</div></blockquote><br>Last one (that isn't related to LUV) - not liking Eager's town block. IMO if you're scum, you either ignore Eager trying to make a town block on D1 or you subtlely encourage him to do so. You don't say 'don't do this you moron.'<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8393349#p8393349\" class=\"postlink\">post 278</a>, boring wrote:</cite>He probably is. I'm the only person who's vocalized annoyance with the concept of a fake town block. I can do it again too. Only VI's and scum would be content with the idea of unconfirmed town being placed on a town block pedestal.</div></blockquote><br>Conclusion - Boring's interactions with LUV put her in my town pile once more. @Implosion / Prism - at some point we're going to have to reconcile this difference of opinion. Now or later - up to you guys.</div></div></div><br><br>Luv V.

Reads like Grendel hopping on a bus as he watches the LUV lynch gain steam, but leaves room for another wagon if the town changes its mind.

At least, not the likes of Zoronos, or Implosion who are living in a world were scum never pull any unusual gambits.

I felt like had you pretty much pegged as scum off the wagon. I still had my strong town read on shadow, and while I wasn\u2019t particularly keen on Penguin, I thought you were worse in comparison. I thought the likihood that you are scum was like\u2026 in the 90\u2019s percentile. And if that doesn\u2019t make me confidant, and a bit lazy, coming into today then I don\u2019t know what would. <br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic\">Hold on there buckaroo</span>, you wanted my current read on you. It wasn\u2019t like that \u201chalf a novel\u201d was unprovoked. Also gross word usage, if you consider four paragraphs half a novel then\u2026 idk, just seems like a bad description. You wanted me to respond with a read. If I said, \u201cI think you\u2019re town\u201d. Would that seriously been enough for you? <br><br>If I had done that then you would be accusing me of being too vague right now. <br><br>I just find that you being suspicious of Shadow when I was the one who first called him out, while keeping me as top scum is pretty bad imo. You being perfectly happy to see Me, boring, shadow, and Penguin lynched makes me wonder if we are all town, and you are scum. You have Dierfire out there too, but given that town has four lynches left. It comes across like a back pocket read. Since lynching us in order of who you find most scummy would be Me&lt;Boring&lt;PengiunPower&lt;Shadow. That mean you would not actually have to see Deirfire lynched. So you sayyou can't read him, and say he is probably scum for it, but you aren't willing to lynch him over the other four right? <br><br>This is part of the reason I could see a LUVxDeirfirexnn30 scum team btw."}

He's prided himself on taking a very ambitious, intellectual approach to the game, but regularly stops at the most basic level of speculation. He said he looks forward to matching wits with us, and made ambitious statements like RQS working him but not \"for the masses\" and that he tries to pin the whole scumteam Day 1 collectively rather than focus individuals. Simultaneously, his night kill speculation on Maria's death was \"boring wouldn't make that because it implicates her\" despite that being <span style=\"font-style: italic\">exactly what you would expect a scum defense to be.</span> Several of his stronger townreads have been for things as simplistic as \"draws attention to themselves\". It seems really strange to take pride in taking a \"deeper\" approach to the game yet settle for assuming the other players are incapable of more than one level of WIFOM.<br><br>With all of the above in mind, Grendel has shot up to #1 on my scum list. boring is a lot more likely to be town now. My reasoning for voting her has largely been based on PoE and not liking her attitude. The biggest thing that flags me to her being scum is Grendel's hesitance to vote her, and that says a lot about what I think about Grendel.<br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: </span><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Grendel</span></div></blockquote><br><br>I\u2019m tempted to ignore all the people scum reading me for having ties to LUV. At this point I don\u2019t think I can convince anybody of anything here. My only response is that I don\u2019t keep back pocket reads as scum for various reason, one of which I already explained. <br><br>Personally, I think that your second to last paragraph marches dangerously close to a Politian\u2019s rhetoric. Which I\u2019m not a fan of. As for the issue between how I try to appear smarter then I really am\u2026 yeah I do that a lot in hopes of attracting a night kill early into the game. I try to come off as smart and clever so I can to make scum nervous. For the most part its all a show. I have moments where I\u2019ve done some cool things, but generally speaking I\u2019m not much of a intellectual lol. <br><br>I think is mainly an issue of my inability to multitask, my forgetfulness, and a tight schedule. If I had these I think I\u2019d be a more formidable player. <br><br>I've town read people for simple reasons sure, what's so bad about that? I generally keep things open at day start, then start narrowing down onto who I think is the best lynch. Usually the mid point of the day is where I compete my narrowing down of the lynch pool, and move into making a hard stance that I push until either they are lynched or they aren't. This has become a more recent trend for me so I can't grantee many completed games here display this as factual. If I write off somebody as town for something one dimensional it doesn't mean I write them off from the rest of the game. When a new day rises I start over with many reads expect my strongest scum read (Whom I vote) and my strongest town read(s), then I precede to sort the people in the middle regardless of their place meant the day before. Once the game is nearing lylo, or is lylo, I go back and evaluate all the unconfirmed players as hard as I can.<br><br>RQS isn't a big factor there, its mainly a point to start talking, and most the reads I develop are lite ones. Did I really say \"RQS doesn't work for the masses, but it does work for meeee\"? If so then that came off as much more elitist then I meant for it too.  <br><br>There are situation where their really isn't anything I can say that has been said. The town read around you is one of them. I could say that how hard you were on LUV is town like. I could say the aggressive way you address the game state is townie. <br><br>Is FE8 your favorite fire emblem? (I've been like- wanting to ask this question for ages)<br><br>I would like to hear your reaction to my recent posts because I <span style=\"font-style: italic\">was</span> hunting for teams the whole time. I just thought it was funny that you brought that up as a point before I had a chance to reveal what I\u2019ve been thinking about the past few days."}

Depending on how they play it, they can town clear until it gets into later days. Or they can use their 'knowledge' to bus a partner, become conf town as a result, and ride into lylo on the goodwill. Or they can claim a scum result on a townie which would result in either a 1 for 1 trade (themselves for the towny) or they could wiggle out of it by saying 'welp, I guess I'm a cop that gives reverse results and didn't know it.' Or something to that effect.<br><br>Seems like a smart move from scum tbh. Lots of strategic room to maneuver. <br><br>I'll reiterate though - I believe penguin at the moment."}

Primarily because as scum I don\u2019t think you\u2019d unvote, then put all this effort into thinking about the game state as a whole. If you were scum I\u2019d imagine that you would be perfectly happy to ride me to my death. <br><br>I had some serous paranoia about you over the course of night two, but I\u2019m pretty over it now. It was how you went on that tangent at EoD yesterday about serial killers. As a rule of thumb I find players that are paranoid about third party roles with night kill capabilities to be a scum tell. Mainly since a SK would be a threat to scum during the night, and can be leashed by town if found out making them as dangers as a vigilante to the mafia.

It is unlikely that both Dier and I are scum together. Therefore, either we're both town or one of us is scum. At most one of us is scum - which means you're wrong about one of us.

I think that, from a probabilistic perspective, it makes more sense from a Town player claiming legitimately than from a Mafia player making a gamble (this is where I was after the initial claim). Whether that was a reason sufficient to justify the apparent strength of the read given by boring is a matter best answered by boring (I, for example, had eagerSnake as one of my weaker reads); I looked to <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8389054#p8389054\">73</a> for an answer and it seemed that boring thought the claim sufficient that eagerSnake would either die or be held in suspicion for living. Therefore none of the reaction from boring to the second claim seemed out of place to me. In fact, of all the players that wanted to lynch eagerSnake after the second claim from Shadow_step, boring had the most prior evidence that her read on eagerSnake was primarily based on the first claim.<br><br>You also made the point that boring seemed artificially rather than genuinely unconcerned about the wagon forming on her. To assess this, I would look at her attempts to read those voting for her (if she is genuine that the wagon on her is in part a positive thing because it informs the alignments of players on the wagon, she should show evidence of trying to use that information). She had appropriate questions out to nn30 (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8409783#p8409783\">1266</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8413118#p8413118\">1363</a>, especially <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8413334#p8413334\">1382</a>) and Gamma Emerald (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8413161#p8413161\">1365</a>). She appears to have made some attempt to read you as well (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8425328#p8425328\">1555</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8427761#p8427761\">1609</a>) and to have revisited Gamma Emerald in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8427822#p8427822\">1610</a>. I was hoping to have a deeper analysis from her with the results of those inquiries; I will prompt her directly.<br><br>You made the third point (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8417063#p8417063\">1463</a>) that boring had a \"tepid\" response (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8416740#p8416740\">1453</a>) to the suggestion from eagerSnake that we pass on the lynch. It seems clear to me that boring was demonstrating that better play from eagerSnake as Town would have been to push for lynching boring rather than no lynch at all (I don't read \"are you suggesting that we give a free kill to the Mafia?\" as a serious question but rather as a rhetorical one). I've no problem with the tenor of her response; I acknowledge your argument that it sounds \"detached\" but find this unpersuasive as a reason to vote for boring.</div></blockquote></div></div></div><br><br>Another thing is that Dier had posts like this where he looked into boring, but wasn\u2019t sold. I just think the transitions later when he voted boring later came off as forced given he spent so much time being skeptical of the reasons people scum read her. His logic that he doesn\u2019t see anything pointing to town in boring, plus a VC later as enough to justify this move.

On further consideration, though, I'm not sure that any was needed. If your theory is that Shadow_step has a Mafia Ascetic role, the Roleblocker function is not necessary to explain the decision to kill Gamma Emerald, right? In fact, I'd think that a Mafia team with an Ascetic Roleblocker (and one capable of killing and blocking by night according to the opening post) could get away with either action, whereas a Mafia team with an Ascetic Goon would be more likely to go after the claimed Cop.<br><br>Anyway, I've reviewed the Shadow_step again, and while to a certain degree I agree with the ideas that he has been playing in an unhelpful manner, I think that his claim is more likely to come from a Town Ascetic role than a Mafia Ascetic role.

Settling on boring a few posts later. Logically, it\u2019d make sense for Dierfire to vote boring, given his null-scum read. Yet, consider the VC he uses lets him ignore LUV for other players as far as taking action goes. Namely Dier lines up boring/nn30, then he moves to Penguin/me if boring is scum, and ends with \u201csomebody off the wagon\u201d effectively putting LUV on the back burner. Even as he moves on to access LUV as the most likely of scum compared to Zoro, or Prism, his interest remains elsewhere.

The percentile is 86% of the time going off a sample size of 96 players that submitted RQS answers in previous games that pertained to the subject. To get more specific 43% of people favored Scum, and of those who answered 86% of them bussed at least one buddy at some point in the same game the submitted their answers. Those who preferred town did bus too, but only 33%, which is significantly smaller then those who favored mafia. <br><br>5)You rode LUV to death harder then anybody and earlier then anybody...<br><br>6)I've decided to not give you a town read for your being on the LUV wagon, and I'd advise anybody reading this to do the same in future. <br><br>Instead of evaluating nn30 next as I had originally intended.

It also gives him an excuse to spend the whole day tunneling Eager, and be justified by the outcome regardless what Eager flips. He do say this as town, but it'd be an awfully convenit stance to take as scum sense he can look like aggressive town while not actually being aggressive towards other players.

Usually something directed at Shadow too. Also Shadow is once again painting the mod as the scape goat. Maybe it's just me, but shadow has been evading the responsibility for his actions this game, starting with his fake 1-L vote on Pengiun back in Day 1.<br><br>Seeing how the most town thing I had to say about Shadow going into today was his behavior D1 tells me that he has been keeping a low profile since Eager flipped. Also nobody pointing out some of these things means that everybody has written off Shadow as town. Which imo is a big mistake that I too was a part of yesterday. The entire purpose of a powerful D1 scum gambit is to rack up enough town cred to slide into the endgame. This is exactly what Shadow is doing.<br><br>You know, I had originally thought that Shadow step was an investigative role given his jump on Gamma at the start of D2 along the lines of \u201cOh yeah, this is scum btw\u201d. I thought that he was softing a guilty, the same way he did at the start of D1 where he remarked how easy the game will be after Eager\u2019s claim.

I wound up townreading him partially for that. I think the thing I missed there was that it's important to look at not just the reasoning, but also who the reasoning is directed towards.

The jailkeeper is more powerful than the cop at this stage. Offensive jail gives a solid chance of autowin as it's a report and a blocked kill in one, meaning it can be done twice in a row. Even if Zoronos fails, if there's only one scum, we still get a clear out of it. That's a lot better of a deal than we were getting out of PenguinPower who was worth one report max. If Zoronos jailed PP and they killed optimally yesterday we literally would have thrown all of our advantage out the window.<br><br>If we lynch correctly today, assuming Zoronos is town, we win the game.

That leaves me with four players: Boring, Prism, nn30, and Dierfire.<br><br>Boring is the one I'm most confident is scum. D1 play had a lot of scum motivation, and I found some of her posts to be really manipulative. The nightkill only cemented that. In hindsight, the fact that four confirmed townies were voting her is another mark against her. Frankly, I'm surprised she it made this far when she should have been lynched D1 over Eagersnake. But everyone's finally coalesced on a scumread of her so better late than never I guess. By the way, her attack on my predecessor today was really bad too. Despite being so wrong early on, it was SO obvious that Shadow_Step was town based on how he cc'd Eagersnake.<br><br>I was scumreading Prism all the way up until he said he was going to replace out. I don't think scum would ever do that out of frustration from being caught. It's just poor sportsmanship especially if Shadow had called the scumteam. I get that this may be a controversial reason to have a read but Prism's almost replacing out pretty much confirms him as town for me. But I'm making a note to ISO him just to be sure.<br><br>So, I'm fairly confident boring's partner is between Dierfire and nn30. Knowing I was wrong about Prism, one of my townreads on either Dierfire or nn30 is also wrong. It seems the consensus is that Dierfire is boring's partner but I think I want to read both their ISOs to see if I feel the same way as the others.<br><br>In the meantime, @Implosion, if you could explain to me why nn30 is town (or just link me to posts if you've done this already), that would be fantastic. I was actually leaning the opposite way (nn30 being scummier than Dierfire) but that's from memory and I need to re-read. Either way, I want to go with Boring first since that's who I think will definitely flip scum, and then worry about who her partner is tomorrow."}

With eagerSnake, I was half expecting him to withdraw the claim; the fact that he hasn't rules out some Town plays (Bulletproof or Miller trying to draw the kill were my first thoughts, I also thought of Wary but I don't know if that's common on this site because I can't find it in the Wiki--certainly it's not Normal). It also weighs against some Mafia plays (I agree with the idea that a Mafia Ascetic role is powerful and probably unlikely to claim early without withdrawing the claim later, so I'd find a Mafia Goon more likely).<br><br>A few points since the claim make me suspicious of eagerSnake. First, and most obviously, eagerSnake actively resisted attempts by Zoronos (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8403934#p8403934\">785</a> and others) and nn30 (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8404675#p8404675\">888</a>) to provide content that would help us judge his alignment independently of the Ascetic claim. This seems consistent with a Mafia player in significant danger of being lynched and trying to avoid giving associative information (discussion of possible self-vote in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8405302#p8405302\">980</a> is also consistent with that thought process). The vote on implosion in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8387319#p8387319\">1212</a> is also strange given that boring is the larger wagon and was the player eagerSnake was most confidently reading as Mafia (I don't see any change from <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8406818#p8406818\">1104</a>). Of course, I think that the reasons to vote for boring didn't hold much water in the first place (<strike>next post</strike> post after next), which is also suspicious (I'm not buying that eagerSnake was simply too uncertain to make a meaningful case--in that event, he should have been working at improving his reads rather than repetitively insisting that he was Town).<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: PenguinPower</span><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: eagerSnake</span><br><br><span style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">I want a full claim from eagerSnake.</span></span><br><br>I saw someone else ask this and get the \"fishing\" dodge, so to be clear: I am inclined to lynch eagerSnake <span style=\"font-style: italic\">unless</span> he has some additional reason that we should leave him alive.</div></blockquote><br><br>There's a lot more confidence in your read on Eager here as well as 0 credence given to Eager's theory that both he and Shadow were town.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8418099#p8418099\" class=\"postlink\">post 1516</a>, Dierfire wrote:</cite>I'm ready for a hammer.</div></blockquote><br>You even ask for a hammer.<br><br>Comparing your ambivalence towards LUV to your confidence in lynching Eager, and I'm just more convinced of my scum theory on you.

The coaching tell may not be relevant since he scumhunts that way and did it to Eager as well.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>Dierfire - Early townreads on Implosion, nn30, and Grendel are fairly solid.

Checking Eager's meta seems town but timeline seems off. Ask about this. Why PRs? But odd for scum to ask in thread. No opinions about RVS? Suspects Grendel due to response to Implosion, questions why Zoronos is town, then agrees with Zoronos to vote Implosion. Then agrees on Grendel-town. Wierd. Too much agreeing, stances change conveniently. Not Boring's partner.

Don't lynch early but be very wary of this read. Too conscious about whether his reads lined up. Could be boring partner. It seemed like he was distancing but never joins the wagon + how did he catch Eager's manipulation but missed Boring's? Paranoia of Dier seems townie (wants him to be town) after Dier townreads him.

I was rather annoyed to see everyone dismissing those points, even more so when Shadow_Step opened D2 by saying that the nightkill was meant to frame Boring and people started assuming Implosion could only be right because he was scum and knew both cc's were town.

Our town power seems a lot heavier, as even with ascetics they provide distinctive claims from the VTs. Assuming Zoronos is real I suspect it is very likely that either scum has a jailkeeper enabler (presumably the scum expected to go first) or that the player expected to go further is a strongman.<br><br>Without a circumventing scum PR, I think killing Zoronos was almost certainly optimal. Gamma/PP gave only one more report in the event they didn't die. PP was still potentially lynchable. Zoronos in contrast has a chance to block back to back scum and is not lynchable. Town also gets a pseudoclear post-death if he dies with only one scum left. This threat continues into the next night, even after cop/deputy has died. The only way not killing Zoronos is optimal is if they are confident that scum will not be lynched, either Day 3 or on Day 4.<br><br>With this in mind, I think I've drawn up the best strategy for tomorrow. Assuming we get a scum lynch today, we will still have a mislynch. If there is no kill tomorrow night, Zoronos outs who he jailed, and we lynch outside that person and Zoronos. That night, if our lynch is on town, Zoronos jails the same person. If we again get a no kill, it is safe to lynch that person as we've just been granted a second mislynch and therefore get no harm out of using it on the jailed. If Zoronos dies instead, we get the same pseudokill a day delayed.<br><br>This works best if there's no scum circumvention. If there is it prevents outright framing of a town before the kill. If they no kill once then kill the next day, our extra person we prevent the death of to turn 3 way into 4 way is Implosion. The only downside to this I see is if scum has an every other night strongman.<br><br>P-Edit:<blockquote><div><cite>nn30 wrote:</cite>Keep in mind he made the majority of those reads before he got a role pm.</div></blockquote>That is the point.

My reads are my worst part of my towngame (See: Implosion, Grendel) but I'm still very sure it's boring/Dierfire. I really don't believe Shadow pulled his Day 1 as scum, nor that you are this capable of a scum.

As boring was a major wagon D1, it would not make much sense to me that Lil Uzi Vert would be selected as the target for a committed bus; rather I would read boring's vote as designed to create distance and I would expect that the lack of a significant wagon on boring D2 indicates that the Mafia were not attempting to sacrifice there.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">nn30</span> is unlikely to be Mafia in any case. As I've said already, the VC in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8405180#p8405180\">950</a> makes nn30 unlikely to have been partners with Lil Uzi Vert because they stacked votes on Shadow_step when the logic for stacking votes on eagerSnake would have been easier to fabricate. This also especially makes nn30 unlikely to be Mafia with BlackVoid (because that would mean that two Mafia players stacked votes on their third partner while ignoring <span style=\"font-style: italic\">two</span> larger wagons on Town players with easier logic). Finally, I agree with the analysis by Shadow_step (in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8509612#p8509612\">2865</a>) that it seems unlikely that a Mafia team of boring and nn30 would have boring commit the kill.<br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">New this issue:</span> this does raise the problem of why Lil Uzi Vert, known to be Mafia, would do such a thing at all. I speculate that if Shadow_step (now BlackVoid) and boring were <span style=\"font-style: italic\">both</span> Mafia the play might make some sense; Lil Uzi Vert could have been worried about stacking a third Mafia vote on eagerSnake but also reluctant to bring the boring wagon close to completion. By the same token, although to me it seems less likely, nn30 and boring could both be Mafia; in that case, nn30 and Lil Uzi Vert would have stacked on Shadow_step in order to avoid being on a wagon in direct competition with boring. This isn't wholly implausible given the way that Lil Uzi Vert migrated to the eagerSnake wagon eventually, but the way that nn30 went to the boring wagon instead (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8405317#p8405317\">983</a>) suggests to me that Shadow_step would have been a more likely third partner than nn30.<br><br>I've expressed that both Prism and nn30 are unlikely to be Mafia based on negative associations with Lil Uzi Vert, unlikely to be partners with BlackVoid, and unlikely to be partners with boring (Prism less likely than nn30).

However, as I've said in the above section, there are significant negative associations with Prism and nn30, so the only plausible partner would be boring--and I may have worked out a few scenarios in which the voting pattern makes sense with a Mafia team of Lil Uzi Vert, boring, and Shadow_step. Most obviously, the odd behavior by Lil Uzi Vert (voting for Shadow_step rather than eagerSnake) raises my suspicion that something strange is going on, and it would make sense if boring is Mafia and eagerSnake already had two Mafia votes. The way that Lil Uzi Vert was so conservative with votes D1 (the vote for Shadow_step after both claims were out was the first vote since RVS) would also fit a player scared to vote in general, which is consistent with a player scared to stack votes with partners. Furthermore, I found that the reaction that Shadow_step had to seeing boring at L-1 (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8474710#p8474710\">2401</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8474738#p8474738\">2403</a>, no hammer on boring and continues to push the nn30 lynch despite what appears to be a case against boring in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8474704#p8474704\">2400</a>) makes Shadow_step more likely to be partners with boring and less likely to be partners with nn30. More recently, I note that boring and Shadow_step have been fighting (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8495011#p8495011\">2727</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8495472#p8495472\">2734</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8508121#p8508121\">2846</a>) but without voting in a way that resembles creating distance (for example, Shadow_step claimed to have found my VT claim most suspicious in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8487798#p8487798\">2636</a> and to have preferred to lynch boring in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8487875#p8487875\">2639</a>, but kept a vote on nn30 throughout). In fact, Shadow_step never voted for boring, and boring votes Shadow_step in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8492521#p8492521\">2704</a> at a time when the lynch is unpopular (marked opposition from me in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8482754#p8482754\">2559</a>, implosion in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8492658#p8492658\">2709</a>, Zoronos in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8495821#p8495821\">2746</a>, PenguinPower in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8495997#p8495997\">2762</a>).<br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">So what about that claim?</span> On its face, I still have problems with it because the Ascetic claim ought to be low priority for the Mafia to counter (it is relatively easily dispatched by night or lynched later), and because Shadow_step did appear lay early groundwork for doubting the claim.

I consider a fringe theory that this mention of Traitor and the early RVS vote for Lil Uzi Vert (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8388083#p8388083\">9</a>) were attempts to subtly inform the Mafia players of the situation.

That post gives me two reasons to think nn is town:<br><br>-the indignance with which he describes his play as town. This is more of a gut thing, it isn't going to be rigorously justifiable. It does go beyond simply indignance; it feels to me like nn is genuinely trying to work with people to solve the game. His insistence that the people pushing him give cases, his rhetoric towards Zoronos, and so on. <br><br>-his throwing townreads out left and right. If he's scum then the way that he went into today is painting himself into a corner, immediately striking out both pp and boring as likely directions for him to push in going forward. Granted, he did flip on boring now, but in a reasonable way in response to new information which him as scum wouldn't have known would be guaranteed to happen. To generalize he is playing this day very off-the-cuff, throwing reads out and laying his opinions bare for everyone to investigate. Saying he <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8468267#p8468267\">doesn't want to vote Grendel because he's just a counterwagon</a>, then giving <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8468278#p8468278\">real reasons</a> to vote him 7 minutes later.

He doesn't have a plan. His play just doesn't feel like scum who's trying to get a person in particular lynched, or avoid lynching anyone else in particular, or try to avoid being lynched himself; his play is just too much a combination of putting himself out there and not having a plan behind it to be scum, I think.</div></blockquote><br>So, I read the posts you are pointing out.

It also comes with the chance of Penguin stating who he investigated, saying he got no result, and scum throwing shade at that person 'for not claiming ascetic' earlier (ala Lynch all Liars). <br><br>By no means does this line of thought discount the possibility of scum having a role blocker, but it is a wrinkle to consider. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8518501#p8518501\" class=\"postlink\">post 2971</a>, BlackVoid wrote:</cite>NN30 being so easily convinced that Boring was scum after I posted reasons seemed pretty suspicious actually.

Never the head of either - the player leading the charge for the lynch. While you were on PP, you didn't talk about him much at all or advocate for that train to move forwards. You mostly seemed to be talking to Grendel. (I kind of liked your evaluation of Grendel's conciliatory post to Gamma, actually <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8403204#p8403204\">623</a>). <br>However that suspicion also never seemed to get pushed based the suspicion phase.<br><br>At the time of the CC, you had Eager as your number 2 town read, after SS at number one. That suggests, to me, that you didn't have a lot of skepticism about his claim. Furthermore, I find \"He survived the night, he must be scum\" to be a really awful way to evaluate PR's (since it depends on the playstyle of the scum team on whether they are risk averse or not, which is hidden information). It makes it really easy for scum to try to lynch PR's by building up mistrust.<br><br>So, when you immediately flipped on him as soon as the CC happens, that seems scummy to me. You didn't take the time to re-evaluate the read or look for other indications on whether he was scummy. Just 'Oh counterclaim yup top scum' and a vote. There wasn't evidence of skepticism or evaluation. If someone counterclaims one of my top town reads, I am always going to try and think carefully about why my town read might have been wrong, or if something else is afoot.<br><br>So, I don't think you've done a lot of active scum hunting, haven't been an evangelist for the trains you've been on, and I question your sudden certainty on Eager-scum. Those things add up to my gut thinking you're playing a happy coincidence of two town having the same role modifier, and you get a free mislynch.<br>However, the logical case hasn't caught up to my gut and I am wary of just interpreting events into conf-bias land.

If boring is vanilla scum it probably doesn't matter anyway since I'll get blocked there and there will be a false \"clear\" on DF which means whatever tack I take here is meaningless.<br>2) NN is scum and is trying to bait the jail by attacking me, knowing that he's Strongman (or a roleblocker with priority), and is hoping to get me to declare him my target so he can claim a clear tomorrow.<br>Basically - If I die tonight, and boring doesn't flip a blocking role, ignore whatever results from my jail.

NN's nonsense posting here makes me want to just call him scum and jail him, but that's likely my frustration / perception of his shortsightedness.

It also undermines the possible scenario where he's explicitly trying to bait out the jail, since that relies on boring being a goon, which decreases the scum motivation for the play.<br>So, boring flipping something that would prevent JK'ing strongly indicates a DF jail is the best plan, imo.<br><br>If boring flips town:<br>I was right, but saying 'I told you so' seems a bit inappropriate given the track record so far.

It would take a lot of premeditation to run his D1 play. I've seen the 'anti charistmatic' scum line run before, but not in the direct insult case, only in the 'insult accusers' case.

This one's pretty stream of though..<br><br>My townread on nn30 has honestly been very much mired in confirmation bias but I don't think that means it's wrong. I started townreading them sometime either late Day 1 or early Day 2 and from there there's just been constant affirmations to the fact dealing with demeanor/the timing of certain posts. They were fakeable but I found it unlikely, as they were basically exactly what I wouldn't expect from nn scum at exactly the right times. If he's scum he's a borderline psychic which is why I called him god at a keyboard. Based off Implosion's statements regarding nn30 he probably understands what I mean. Yeah, my read is largely tonebased and may be an exaggeration, and at some point I might have to read through a nn30 scumgame or really go through interactions with LUV/earlier boring interactions but that's a lot of effort for something that will probably wind up pointless.<br><br>The only reasons I can see for nn30 are the boring/Zoronos interactions the last few pages. The former feels like bad distancing, the latter scum is kind of forced to throw shade on Zoro here if there's no circumvention, or if boring is that circumvention. I find both unlikely given nn's readiness to lynch boring until her selfhammer shenanigans.<blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8518619#p8518619\" class=\"postlink\">post 2976</a>, BlackVoid wrote:</cite>I don't Penguin was likely to get mislynched at all. I think people realized how well his role fit into the setup. Without it, town would be underpowered.</div></blockquote>This really isn't immediately relevant to anyone's alignment I think as DF/nn30/you all would have made that kill, but I definitely wasn't sold on him being town, especially given that scum claiming all VT there was bad play with a jailkeeper in the mix (I probably would have fakeclaimed BP after the deputy claim to cast doubt on one). Part of the purpose of my <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8497968#p8497968\" class=\"postlink\">#2699</a> and <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8497968#p8497968\" class=\"postlink\">#2802</a> were in the hopes that they'd nightkill him over Zoronos who I suggested as the \"likely kill\". Jailkeeper is about as valuable as deputy given how likely I thought we were to lynch scum, but in my opinion Zoronos had a higher chance of being town than PP did at the time.<br><br>Finally having read Dierfire: Going through I see nothing suggesting he's not scum with boring/LUV, <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8453394#p8453394\" class=\"postlink\">#2070</a> makes a case for lynching LUV only to backtrack and give a vote on boring that wasn't happening. Despite saying in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8459781#p8459781\" class=\"postlink\">#2194</a> that 1. He didn't believe LUV's claim 2. He saw no convincing reason to put it off. he still didn't hammer him. <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8468404#p8468404\" class=\"postlink\">#2277</a>, the first post after the LUV flip where DF kept his vote on boring, is all about justifying townreads. At the end he says he'd like to vote Grendel or boring and picks Grendel despite not mentioning him the entire post.<br><br>To be honest I don't think anything here is a strong affirmative to go for Dierfire, but I really don't see a reason not to. Nothing about LUV/boring and DF tell me that's not the team and everyone else has towntold harder. If I were to go more indepth and find deeper reasoning to scumread him not based off of PoE I imagine it's there but DF is clearly no slouch at staying rational or consistent. His townread on me despite it being advantageous to walk back awhile ago is probably the only plus in his favor, but at this point it's looking more like a failed bet.<br><br>The last 2/3 pages I'm too tired to go through, I see more on roleblockers &amp; strongmen, and I see more speculation as to the setup. I don't really want to get into it, I think I already explained my point about nn30's interactions with boring, and why I find it unlikely that Black faked the reads. Black townreading me for that replace out makes 0 sense if he's mafia because all he'd have to do is just not mess up and ride into the sunset, and townreading me as scum has the potential to backfire.<br><br>I'm not 100% sold that there's guaranteed a JK via the setup (I still think ascetics are powerful in their own right and we don't know the scum PRs, if any) but the doubt being thrown on Zoros suddenly isn't the best idea. Being paranoid is how we throw away a free win. Save it for 3/5 way LyLo. In the event boring is a circumvention PR or scum have none, scum throwing shade on Zoro is literally their only chance to win. boring's last statement on him is a pretty obvious WIFOM in my opinion and I think he's more likely town for it. 0 reason to even draw attention to her partner here, I would have told her to keep quiet long ago for reasons like this below: <blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8519638#p8519638\" class=\"postlink\">post 3004</a>, boring wrote:</cite>Actually,  @Prism - What do you think of nn's sudden turn on Zoronos?<br><br>I guess you being scum would also explain why you're so very twitchy about the slightest hints that you might be scum, and why you always try to force others to do the research for you. It's a pretty typical power play, and it's something I've been observing all game. I had pretty much chalked it down to your personality, but if someone's doing a meta dive, they might as well check for that.</div></blockquote>If nn is your partner over DF you did him a pretty big disservice with this, not that I'm going to lynch him before DF but maybe if we keep going. If you were trying to irritate me Shadow-style with that last part, it didn't work.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">tl;dr: I'm still not convinced it's anyone but Dierfire, and I don't see any reason to pore over nn's meta and Shadow/Zoronos's ISOs when we don't even know if we need to yet.

Some combination of the way they pushed me early, the way they asked to replace out, the way they generally feel like they're trying to make things more transparent. <br>You (Zoronos): Town because 2 power roles (really effectively one power role split across two players) is not enough in 3:10 especially w/ ascetics.<br><br>So yeah.

Therefore, in your hypothetical situation, both players would be roleblocked simultaneously, and lose all other actions.

X-night/oneshot strongman seems likely to me and while I hope Zoro jailed DF but the way he said \"If boring flips a blocking role\" does not inspire me with confidence that he didn't jail me or BV instead. People seem to be viewing ascetic as a negative utility role which is not necessarily true-any separate title for role has power in itself, but there's more. Purpose of the ascetics was to counter the scum neopolitan.

The only thing that gives me pause is that he seemed really intent on checking to see if Boring was scum before finally lynching her D4. I'd expect scum to be more bus-happy when it became rather obvious that Boring was going to be the lynch. Overall, probably scum but nothing stands out like a smoking gun and I don't think it's impossible for him to have those progressions as town. I'll take a look at nn30 more closely but unless something is extremely incriminating, I'm probably going to vote Dierfire as the path of least resistance and if I'm wrong, move to 3P lylo."}

More powerful than his reasons for voting Lil Uzi Vert is the reaction that Lil Uzi Vert has to those reasons and the way that Prism follows up in conversation. In the quotes below, Prism is pursuing Lil Uzi Vert while Lil Uzi Vert appears to be evading Prism rather than engaging with him, which is an unusual pattern for Mafia partners.</div></blockquote>I think his reasoning here for why me/LUV aren't partners is a good one, but given that someone <span style=\"font-style: italic\">besides</span> boring had to be scum at #2955, I really think this was worth more consideration. Any interaction is fakeable, especially in daystart, and given our current state I find it really difficult for any town to not be paranoid. The follow up: <blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8517649#p8517649\" class=\"postlink\">post 2955</a>, Dierfire wrote:</cite>New this issue: I also find Prism an unlikely partner for boring due to the fact that Prism and boring both voted for Lil Uzi Vert throughout D2. As boring was a major wagon D1, it would not make much sense to me that Lil Uzi Vert would be selected as the target for a committed bus; rather I would read boring's vote as designed to create distance and I would expect that the lack of a significant wagon on boring D2 indicates that the Mafia were not attempting to sacrifice there.</div></blockquote> is also really strange to me. I basically saved boring Day 3 by switching to Grendel after I reread in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8482453#p8482453\" class=\"postlink\">#2545</a>, and I backed off my early scumread of boring pretty early Day 1 (granted that LUV did try to piggyback off it). This is virtually impossible to miss given an ISO of me. The biggest reason I've had internally to be paranoid was that Dierfire townreading me here is strange given his spot on the block. This is a big leap on my end but I suspect it is because you wanted me as the second mislynch rather than the first.<br><br>Reading the reasoning on the boring/BlackVoid team I'm also unconvinced. I don't want to focus too much on the LUV portion as it's really speculative but LUV's vote on Shadow was WIFOM city, and if anything I'd imagine him throwing a vote on a different town if he was counting on an Eager mislynch. If Shadow was his partner he'd be the one setting up to go deep-so why bus him Day 2? boring/Shadow flips do a lot more to solidify him as town than an LUV flip did for either of them. I don't consider the \"afraid to vote\" part to be an active descriptor of someone who flipped his vote to Shadow's cc on a dime. More importantly than the stuff with LUV,<blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8517649#p8517649\" class=\"postlink\">post 2955</a>, Dierfire wrote:</cite>Furthermore, I found that the reaction that Shadow_step had to seeing boring at L-1 (2401 and 2403, no hammer on boring and continues to push the nn30 lynch despite what appears to be a case against boring in 2400) makes Shadow_step more likely to be partners with boring and less likely to be partners with nn30. More recently, I note that boring and Shadow_step have been fighting (2727, 2734, 2846) but without voting in a way that resembles creating distance (for example, Shadow_step claimed to have found my VT claim most suspicious in 2636 and to have preferred to lynch boring in 2639, but kept a vote on nn30 throughout). In fact, Shadow_step never voted for boring, and boring votes Shadow_step in 2704 at a time when the lynch is unpopular (marked opposition from me in 2559, implosion in 2709, Zoronos in 2746, PenguinPower in 2762).</div></blockquote><br>The only thing I really agree on this is about post #2401. The rest really don't seem that suspect to me, Shadow made it clear he thought one of me/boring was mafia but was more sure on nn30. All of this was plausible with Shadow town. Boring's vote on Shadow is basically inviting discussion on the subject of her/Shadow as partners which is the last thing she wants given leading wagons on DF/Grendel and the knowledge that she just barely dodged a lynch prior. Solo scum with deputy and jailer alive is disastrous. The traitor theory in #2955 was interesting but was voided when the game didn't end, and you haven't really given anything to replace that hole in your reasoning since.<br><br>I agree that the only major reason to townread Shadow_step in memory was the claim, but you said yourself the claim was sufficient/convincing beforehand. There's reason to doubt that but it feels like there's even more reason to doubt me/nn30, and in particular it bothers me that you've looked so much into casting boring's interactions with Shadow in a negative light but didn't catch the BIG redflag of me fucking up the Day 3 lynch which cost us potential autowin. Even I don't see the reason to have me as your strongest townread, at least not just from the reasons you've given.<br><br>I reread Shadow's Day 1 to make sure he really was crumbing ascetic and it definitely looks like it, #169 is the only questionable one I see. That would be a very strong coincidental focus on Eager early, unless he was hoping to just push him in general rather than cc'ing originally. I hate to be mean, especially after I've already made him replace out, but I don't think Shadow is capable of coming up with that cc on the fly as scum, even if he was hoping to do that general push. It seems a lot more expedient to just have boring do the cc rather than risk two, as Shadow himself was the one that said \"there can only be one ascetic\". <br><br>Ever since BlackVoid has replaced in he's played to his own detriment as scum. His townread on me was hasty and is something he will inevitably have to walk back in 3 way to win. It made little sense to give it when Implosion likely would have agreed on me/you going back to back. I don't necessarily agree with BV's reason for me being hard town, because I like to think I would have replaced out as mafia too, but even I have to agree I might not have and either way BV gave a townread that really wasn't to his benefit if he was scum.<br><br>You've admitted in post <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8540708#p8540708\" class=\"postlink\">#3086</a> to other problems with your theory but never really followed up with closing or reconciling it or others left. It really just reads like you've given up today, and sure I expect rhetoric like that as town too since we've all been set on your lynch, but I think the general disinterest in reconciliation of your reads is telling. <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"font-size: 240%; line-height: 116%;\">IN CONCLUSION, FRIENDS, FELLOW CITIZENS, READERS AND PLAYERS ALIKE OF ALL OF MINI NORMAL #1838</span></span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"font-size: 240%; line-height: 116%;\"><span style=\"color: #FF8000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">IT'S HAMMER TIME</span></span></span></span><br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Dierfire</span>"}

I don't think scum would ever do that out of frustration from being caught. It's just poor sportsmanship especially if Shadow had called the scumteam.

Specifically, you've said today that you needed to doublecheck my play to make sure it matches, but it looks like you've already done that prior and found reason to say it doesn't. You've given your reasoning and your list of reads prior to entering so I don't doubt that it was your legitimate read, but it seems really questionable to me to recognize I'm scummy to you, hit the hard override, then subsequently wonder if my outside play was scummy a week later. It seems like a really easy to just revert to a prior state of scumreading me using your original reasoning and claiming that it's stronger than you originally thought. The only thing scummy from BV so far to me is what I stated above so this 3 way is a lot more about either convincing me you're town or convincing me Shadow showed he was scum.<br><br>I get the reason for the original hard override and understand it, but it still doesn't sit right with me despite being rationally consistent. My defense of you yesterday was because I saw no real reason for you to give that townread on me, but your statements here give a very easy way to back out of it depending on the flow of the game.<blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8564492#p8564492\" class=\"postlink\">post 3143</a>, nn30 wrote:</cite>@Prism - on mobile rn so I Can't really go in depth.

This goes double when I regularly slimmed down posts to maximize readability. I don't really feel like it's helpful to ask for examples of which you think are earnest efforts because I think that's a test more of time than of skill as scum to come up with, but I do want something else, because it's been this intangible thing all game. I understand that since a lot of my reasoning on you has been the same, and two townreads never really doubting each other is a powerful thing, but a town and a scum doing it ends in a loss and really I'm just looking for something to assure me that you're not just reflecting my own reasoning back onto me."}

But most people had other reasons for me thinking they were town. Prism didn't have that. He replaced into a lurky slot and made pushes I didn't like D1. D2, he started making a lot more sense.

The one that I most remember is that he scumread someone for inconsistency even when that inconsistency was much more likely from a town perspective-and later he affirmed that inconsistency itself wasn't a scumtell. He was rational and is good at the game, but neither of those decided his role PM, and everyone else was giving him largely a free pass for those things.<blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8569899#p8569899\" class=\"postlink\">post 3165</a>, BlackVoid wrote:</cite>But most people had other reasons for me thinking they were town.

Some of them weren't important and some were, ones that were important were in quick memory: not even trying to consider things from the perspective of me town (like you did for BV, with one example being the boring interactions but there were others), not even reading the posts you linked/giving a distinction that just reinforced that, stomping on an olive branch doesn't mean much when the olive branch never existed (Me saying \"You have to do this to win my vote\" is not telling you you already have my vote).

I'm now reevaluating that assumption. Why wouldn't he think that way given that I was scum misrepping him in his eyes? I can definitely see it given his attitude throughout the game (I had this scum fuck, fucking noobs, why does everyone suck, etc.) It's strange to replace out for your scumread's sake, and all game Shadow showed he didn't give a damn about other people's feelings or perspective.<blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8570230#p8570230\" class=\"postlink\">post 3189</a>, BlackVoid wrote:</cite>You're kidding, right? Do you really think he'd perceive himself the same way you perceive him? Everyone has their own perspective of themselves. Just because you believe someone is arrogant doesn't mean they agree with you and also think of themselves as arrogant.</div></blockquote>My point isn't that he was lying. My point is that he had <span style=\"font-style: italic\">no reason</span> to be that arrogant as town, especially unconsciously. I don't think he was conscious of it, in fact. He literally never voted mafia except for his RVS vote on LUV. Where on earth was that attitude coming from? It's weird to envision with that history thinking they were rocking the game as hard as Shadow thought he was rocking the game.<br><br>To be explicit because I feel this is misinterpreting what I'm saying, I'm not saying Shadow replacing out or being arrogant was a huge scumtell. I think it's possible for both to have happened with him as town-but thinking about it it makes a lot of sense as scum, too. If he's scum he was playing <span style=\"font-style: italic\">great</span>, only to be getting shit on 24/7 for doing his job exceptionally and treated like a VI, and that attitude makes a lot more sense. Replacing out because your strongest scumread hates you is noticeably weirder.<br><br>It's against him in my mind, yeah, but this isn't an airtight case in my book, and I wouldn't be surprised either if Shadow is scum yet my speculation is entirely wrong. The main reasons I'd vote against you now is for my nn townread, despite it being on the decline, and to a lesser extent the interactions with boring that I didn't like and finally what I've brought up here."}

This was his first meaningful contribution to the day beyond 'I'm going to re-read and get to it later.'

I gave some of my original thoughts in a prior post:<blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8572790#p8572790\" class=\"postlink\">post 3194</a>, Prism wrote:</cite>That was me, and I did pick up on the increased aggressiveness in this game, or rather how much you bent over backwards in your other game (#133 was the one that stuck out to me). One of the reasons it's taken longer (besides me obviously getting entangled elsewhere in the game) is because whereas at first I thought that style of posts was nonexistent in your scumgame, when I saw #174 which suggested that it was more complex than it first seemed. Glancing through now I don't see any others as aggressive but the fact that my initial conclusion was wrong is the reason it's taken so long, but I agree that so far it points to you being town. It's expected that you'd play the games differently even if you were scum in both but that's not what I'm looking for here.</div></blockquote>#174 was really the only post of its kind as far as aggression goes, nn has been significantly more aggressive this game but some of that can be chalked up to just the sheer fact that we had to deal with Shadow for awhile (ex. <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8425241#p8425241\" class=\"postlink\">#1549</a>)<br>nn liked to push on inconsistencies that game, ex. <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8375679#p8375679\" class=\"postlink\">this post</a>, and posts like <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8399377#p8399377\" class=\"postlink\">#542</a> in this game do the same but seem a lot better thought out and more precise about what made it a tell, and in general makes a lot of sense to me in hindsight even though I can no longer remember the read I had on Gamma.<br><br>The more useful thing to me was just a chance to go over more of nn's posts. #542 above is one I liked, but there is a whole host of posts large and small trying to get a boring lynch, in particular <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8409680#p8409680\" class=\"postlink\">#1238</a> (a promised case a few hours before if people would hold off on hammering eager) and when he still didn't switch in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8417117#p8417117\" class=\"postlink\">#1473</a>. I'm not going to go through and make links for them/quote them all because that'd take all day, but you can look at the ISO for yourself. There was a point at which nn said something along the lines of \"When boring flips red, we need to take a hard look at Shadow\" which is sketchy in hindsight, as it looks like it could be setting up for an Eager/Shadow back to back mislynch, but nn later winds it back and agrees to work with Shadow when he really didn't need to. There's a lot more to this, such as the tone being off in some posts but really on in others and me thinking it's a me problem, but in general I still am leaning nn town. He pushed boring Day 1, he continued to push her a bit even in possible autoloss (though there were two posts trying to get me/Implosion on Grendel). He pivoted after the LUV flip but posts like this <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8468425#p8468425\" class=\"postlink\">#2279</a> are not the type of posts I'm expecting from a scum partner here, and he comes around pretty quickly by <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8472223#p8472223\" class=\"postlink\">#2354.</a><br><br>I agree that nn's reads this week have been really strange, and I'll get to that in a second, but really this feels more like just waiting for me/nn to implode given the sequences on pages 127 &amp; 128 more than anything else. You're asking nn why he's not rereading, despite the fact he just did a pretty significant one on me/Shadow even though it was incomplete, and you've yet to really give the results of any of yours. I'm failing to see what makes nn's prior days scummy."}

I see this is potentially distancing from a partner while voting town but also could be a townie who thinks Boring and Implosion are partners. Given this, it's odd that he never votes Boring though when a wagon springs up. I'll have to check how this read progressed.<br><br>As far as interactions from Boring's side, I think 622 is more likely to be talking to a partner. The overblown type reaction to stir up theater.

I'll get to them after this.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Day 1, Part 2 (Post-Shadow's counterclaim) - Pages 27 - 62</span></span><br><br>What I don't get about nn30 was why he was so convinced Shadow_step was scum counterclaiming. Even as a spectator before I knew Shadow was town, my initial reaction was \"no way that's scum regardless of Eager's alignment.\" The pressing issues seems to be that Shadow waited a while before counterclaiming but didn't wait long enough and get enough reads, and also that he was scumreading someone Eager had pushed (Penguin). I see this as a fairly weak point. Shadow had to claim at some point, and scum do bus. @nn30, I'm going to read your completed scumgame but if you want to save me time, let me know if you ever bussed your partner or voted them at any point. This is at least consistent with you saying Boring was town after the LUV flip because you don't seem to believe that scum would bus. It seems like bussing is so alien to you and I want to check if that is accurate. The timing of the case on Boring was quite good and nn30 overall did push scum over the town cc's. There were two points he tied Shadow to Boring pretty blatantly and from a newb-scum, this makes sense although I do see why he would think that way as town. Boring's responses to nn30 seem fairly neutral but I'm leaning towards her talking to town based on her tone.<br><br>Prism comes off a lot worse D1. I partly want to believe his tunneling of Implosion is real because of how much bold and caps he uses (believes in his case), but the actual reasons are terrible, Implosion was obvtown, and I can't for the life understand how anyone could scumread him. The remarks to LUV seemed more like passing token remarks about a lurking buddy which he never follows up on. He also criticizes the Boring wagon (I assume this is where he started second-guessing his Boring scumread), and votes Eager as a second choice if he can't get Implosion lynched which feels like classic scum having the top lynch as a \"compromise\" option so he can go back to pushing Implosion the following day. He never votes Boring despite scumreading her even though he keeps implying that Implosion wasn't pushing his Boring scumread hard enough (which means he's saying that they are partners). I just find it hard to buy either his Implosion scumread or his Eager scumread. It's true that Eager did what scum would do (townread Shadow) but Prism is ignoring that if Eager was town, this is <span style=\"font-style: italic\">exactly</span> how he would play the game because Shadow's move indeed made no sense as scum.<br><br>End of day one, I'm definitely leaning towards it being Prism but that's no surprise. I want to read day two very closely to see how he pushed LUV and also go back over the replace out request. Hopefully, I'll be done tonight. D1 was the bulk of this game taking up nearly half the posts. By the way, holy crap, there are so many things that clear Shadow based on how scum interacted with him and reacted to his claim. I'll go over those after I vote and figure out which of you is town."}

You've been basically in the middle to bottom half of the game, and I've made it explicit that I intend to vote you today if I can't get boring.

His play just doesn't feel like scum who's trying to get a person in particular lynched, or avoid lynching anyone else in particular, or try to avoid being lynched himself; his play is just too much a combination of putting himself out there and not having a plan behind it to be scum, I think.</div></blockquote><br>So, I read the posts you are pointing out.

The best move is to double down and push LUV and get the cred for bussing so both Boring and LUV are semi-clear and can dominate the town. I suppose he could have specifically be laying down false interactions and he does pride himself on his scumgame but overall, it comes across as town. Now, I just wonder why Boring wasn't lynched after LUV. Need to see how Prism's D3 plays out. I guess he could be one of those ultra-bussers but if he is, he's a lot smarter than your typical run-of-the-mill scum who bus poorly.<br><br>So, overall Prism comes off way better than nn30 on D2. He not only pushed LUV's lynch but also had Boring as a backup. nn30 forgot about his D1 Boring read for the most part, didn't engage LUV or take stances on him, and mostly pushed players that we now know to be town. The one thing that's bugging me though is I'm wondering if the bus on LUV was co-ordinated by Boring and Prism. It just seems weird that Boring decided to bus the hell out of LUV and nn30 ignored that wagon forming and looked elsewhere. I wish I had Prism meta to read. <span class=\"noboldsig\">@Prism</span> - can you link me to your previous games offsite?"}

But I also think that if he truly didn't know Boring's alignment, he'd be more wary about Penguin trying to set up lynches. In my experience, town are extremely paranoid about people who try to set them up to be lynched after someone else flips town.<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8475394#p8475394\">2421</a> - This is a good post as well and doesn't feel like Prism has inside information about Boring. I'm wondering though how he's so wrong on nn30 given his scumhunting skills so far seemed to be pretty good (he was scumreading both Boring and LUV D2 and D3). The Implosion push was terrible though and doesn't match with the competence he displayed on these two reads.<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8475434#p8475434\">2423</a> - On the other hand, playing into the \"either Prism or Boring\" mentality seems more likely to come from scum.<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8479312#p8479312\">2458</a> - I think this points against Prism being scum.

Prism's switch from Boring to Grendel here making him the top wagon as opposed to her has tons of scum motivation. I could see it from town because some of the reasons he gave are not bad but as far as purely scum-motivated posts go, this one is up there. I think it's somewhat odd that he reads Boring as town now but says that Grendel's hesitance to vote her makes her scum which is pretty classic tie-scum-to-townie. <br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8482506#p8482506\">2549</a> - This Prism post is deadly risky because he suggests that Implosion singularly pick the day's lynch. Implosion has been pretty clear that he wanted Boring so it seems obvious that Boring is who he would push. He also lays down some plans for what Zoronos should do which I think would be shooting himself in the foot if he was mafia. I'm just not sure where his skill level is at and what are the kinds of things he could fake.<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8491772#p8491772\">2699</a> - This is really weak. NN30 hasn't been overwhelmingly town in this game. To be fair, I skimmed some of his posts. Making over 500 posts is overkill and I can't keep track of any of his thoughts or opinions which change on a dime. He's all over the place. I fail to see how you can make any sense of his posting. To call him a god or town is really a stretch.<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8497968#p8497968\">2802</a> - This post is terrible. I think someone clearly as competent as Prism would see why Grendel was town because his posting really seemed like town at the last minute getting their reads together so I don't like it.<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8502579#p8502579\">2831</a> - I really don't get this emphasis on trying to get people to townread him for good reasons. It's a bizarre thing to focus on. If someone is townreading you for bad reasons, then you probe those reasons to figure out their alignment. Who cares if town is townreading you for bad reasons? All that matters is that they are right.<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8508720#p8508720\">2854</a> - Slight towntell to agree with Boring here and say that Shadow was likely scum. It would be odd for scum to be the only ones pushing Shadow.<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8509134#p8509134\">2860</a> - This is a really weird post. D3, nn30 was pushing Boring but then switches over and says he's not convinced Boring is scum. Seriously, all your stance changes are giving me whiplash.<br><br><div align=\"center\"><hr style=\"height:14px; width:100%\"></div><br>So, this could honestly go either way. I'm right at the point where I replaced in. I'm going to take a break and come back and analyze Prism's replace-out request and continue re-reading stuff that happened while I was here. <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">@Prism</span> - Here's what I really need you to go a LOT in-depth on:<br><br>1. Explain to me why you are townreading nn30 as hard as you were at the point you submitted your replace out request. You called him god-level if he was scum and it seemed to me like he was the one townread you were going to take to the bank. I found this an odd choice really. Either you are scum or wrong and I want to figure out which it is.<br><br>2. Would you have posted a replace out request at that point if you were scum? This is important because you keep arguing that the replace-out request shouldn't be the reason for a townread on you. Do you really think it's not alignment indicative? Why exactly did you want to replace out. What post of Shadow's triggered this? <br><br>Other than that, engaging with what I posted seems like a good idea but those are the most pressing questions I want answered. nn30 is batshit crazy and I don't know if I'll be able to get a confident read there. I need a read on you to be my most solid one. Although I will read nn30's three completed games before I continue on with this game since my replace in and get to responding to all of the D6 stuff."}

He's got three completed games. As town, <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=11&amp;t=69155\" class=\"postlink\">Newbie 1757</a>, and <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=11&amp;t=68802\" class=\"postlink\">Newbie 1749</a>. As scum, it's <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=50&amp;t=68400\" class=\"postlink\">Newbie 1741</a> and the associated <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=90&amp;t=68401\" class=\"postlink\">Mafia topic</a> is here.<br><br>His townplay is pretty low-key and there haven't been any wild jumps back and forth between reads. In 1757, he gets some early pressure on page one for mixing up his thought processes but nothing like what I've seen here. His scumplay is rather like his townplay (awkward and low-key). It's quite apparent that if he's scum here, he definitely improved since his first ever forum mafia game. My major hesitation in voting nn30 basically comes down to just how much stuff there is in the thread. Constant case-making, constant pushing in every direction, there's just a ton of content in the thread which is harder to fake than Prism's measured, reasoned analysis. I also think strategic busses at good times would be a hallmark for a player like Prism who claims to be experienced and competent. There is a post <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8371222#p8371222\" class=\"postlink\">here</a> where nn30 as scum votes someone because if he's scum, good, if he's town, he's unhelpful. That's the exact same mentality he showed towards Shadow_Step and it doesn't feature in his towngame.<br><br>However, one of the reasons I had a mild townread on him was due to his constant meta-reads on others which shows he's putting in effort. But this is something <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8382179#p8382179\" class=\"postlink\">he does as scum</a> rendering it null.<br><br>Finally, saying that he was not considering all options when he was scum in lylo is either a lie or a stretch because he was pushing and considering everyone, waited for a townie to vote another and then quickhammered which is similar to what he's doing here. In his two towngames, he was endgamed both times. One of those times, he quickvoted a town player. In the other one, he was pretty sure who he wanted to vote and hammered that player (incorrectly). But none of this crazyness of pushing all sides. Based on nn30 meta, I guess I lean slightly towards him as scum but I need to finish up this game since I replaced in. I want to see if there's anything that might change my mind."}

When Shadow_Step was pushing Dierfire's mislynch, nn30 was happy to not say much about Boring. He was never convinced by Implosion's or Prism's cases against her. So, how is me repeating the same things suddenly a reason to scumread her?<br><br>He also seems overly concerned with who is lynched if one of Boring/Dierfire flips town. But that's circumstantial and Prism's late hop onto Boring was done at a time when it's basically his only option.<br><br>nn30 immediately scumreading me after I said Prism was conf-town and that he and Boring were most likely scum is also something I see as coming from scum. He'd know that it was going to be him or me if I never vote Prism and Boring and Dierfire were the lynches. He even suggests that I should be lynched first so he has the juicy Dierfire mislynch waiting for him in lylo.<br><br>I thought the Zoronos suspicion looked really fake and like a \"I wouldn't kill him after I suspected him move.\" He keeps arguing that he's batshit crazy but his towngame didn't consist of suspecting literally everyone.

There's no real reason for townreading me and his D5 play where he suddenly townreads me and says Dierfire is scum is pretty convenient as well.<br><br>Everytime I read an nn30, my reaction is \"what in the hell?\" There's probably a case on every single person in the playerlist nested under spoiler tags with quotes from that player added with his own scummy little twist.<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8521550#p8521550\">3036</a> - The final post from Prism D4 where he explains the nn30 townread. I really don't follow this at all. Honestly, it seems like the kind of vague reads scum give on townies which I hate. The rest of his analysis is fine. I do get that sometimes it's really hard to explain townreads so that could be it.

There were four town votes on Boring. It's unlikely that five townies independently suspected Boring on D1 and the lynch still didn't go through. Likelihood of at least one scum bussing is pretty high. It's not just that Boring was a mafia PR, her play was scummy and it seemed like she was going to get lynched at some point so bussing makes sense here.<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8540366#p8540366\">3080</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8540384#p8540384\">3082</a>, and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8540386#p8540386\">3083</a> is scum just egging me on to vote Dierfire. <br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8540738#p8540738\">3089</a> - I think this devil's advocate play points somewhat to nn30 being town? <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8540791#p8540791\">3091</a> is dumb if he's town because if Dierfire named him, that would be an auto-loss.

I did a similar thing in that I was undecided about Dierfire but thought nn30 was scummier.

One, making nn30 explain why he townreads you looks to me like you are encouraging him to townread you even more by getting into the mindset of explaining why he thinks you are town. Two, I find the focus on townreads of you to be a really weird thing to be pressing on. It seems like you are more interested in getting people to give townreads that are hard to walk back on while you should be aware that re-evaluating and re-assessing reads is absolutely necessary for good town play. It feels very self-preservationist. Why does it matter to you so much that people can't easily back out of their townreads on you? If they do it in a scummy way, then you've nailed them. The focus is all wrong here.<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8566495#p8566495\">3148</a> - The way I phrased that read (by saying that it would be poor sportsmanship of you to replace out as scum) is the reason I take so much issue with your trying to refute that read and trying to imply that you would have done it as scum too. I'm going to straight up ask again: would you have posted that replace-out request as scum? If so, my understanding of you as a player has been wrong. If not, then I fail to see why you take as much issue with the read as you are doing. For most people, this would absolutely be a towntell. Replacing out when they get caught is just a really shitty thing to do as scum. I think Shadow_Step recognized that too. Why you expect him to think that he's got scum on the ropes and they flailed and replaced out boggles my mind. It makes me wonder if you actually did do it as scum.<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8567518#p8567518\">3154</a> - Wtf is this? Shadow had an ego and you didn't understand why so he's scum? You claimed to have played mafia for five years so surely it would occur to you that there are so many players who look at their town play through rose colored glasses. Who think that their scum lynch rate is absolutely awesome and when they are wrong, they just blame it on the person they mislynched because \"he shouldn't have been so damn scummy!\" Shadow being convinced that the Eager lynch was necessary was frustrating but is hardly something that you would never see from town. This entire post reads like you are manipulating nn30 and trying to make him angry that Shadow called him a newbie. Shadow's replace out was absolutely not likely to happen as mafia. I'm not even saying it wasn't alignment-indicative. I'm flat-out saying it's a towntell. As mafia, if people are dismissing you as VI-town or calling you arrogant-town, you thrive on that, you win the game, and you show them who's the VI. But as town, being disrespected can be frustrating and I assume that's why he's had enough and replaced out because of that.<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8567550#p8567550\">3157</a> - So, your major reason to suspect nn30 is simply because of his push on you. Throughout this lylo, the only criticism you had of him was that he was pushing you which struck me as a very odd thing to focus on. The major reason to suspect me early on D6 was that you were worried that I'd walk back on the townread I gave you for almost replacing out. I also said that you were scummy through my initial read of the thread so it seems like you are worried that I'd be the one to figure you out and are pre-empting that by choosing to set yourself up against me. As opposed to nn30 who the two of you've been mutually townreading all game. I also don't see what scum motivation I would have to hard-townread you for that replace out when no one did and then walk back on it, when I could have simply left you in the lynchpool to begin with.<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8570028#p8570028\">3169</a> - This interpretation of Shadow's replace out is ridiculous and I have a really, really hard time buying that you actually believe it for reasons I outlined in the previous few paragraphs.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><span style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;\">@nn30</span></span><br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8564492#p8564492\">3143</a> - This is just a bad mentality to get into. There is no circumstance under which town don't deserve to win the game. I'm of the opinion that every game is solvable. This is probably one of the harder lylo decisions I've had to make. Typically I find it a lot easier.<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8567004#p8567004\">3153</a> - Somehow I missed the timing of this post the first time around. This definitely happened when I said I was pretty much voting nn30 and it seemed like he could win a 1v1 against me with Prism as the decider. Prism later saying that he never gave nn30 an olive branch seems like a stretch because as of this post, I'm sure Prism would have voted me over nn30 so I do take this to be a towntell. I in fact, don't understand why the heck Prism was townreading you so this pretty nailed it."}

It just didn't feel right so I started thinking about the possibility Prism was scum. Then seeing his posts this lylo was what really sold it for me. His interpretation of Shadow's posts seemed like he's stretching past the point of believability. Without any offence, I'll also say that Prism came across as more experienced than you. You seem to have started playing mafia on a forum only recently, and it's more a stretch to believe that you are playing like this than it is that Prism strategically bussed and that his too-perfect play is actually indicative of good scumplay.<br><br>The fact that I couldn't get behind why he was scumreading Boring or LUV added to that and it seemed like an informed perspective. Your early case on Boring doesn't seem too good to be true because you were literally throwing out spoilered cases left, right, and center. It's only natural that you would have a case on Boring at some point. You didn't treat her any differently than you treated anyone else.<br><br>The Eagersnake/Shadow cc battle was extremely advantageous for scum. Prism's play there took advantage of it despite him saying that Boring was scum at a very critical juncture. Yours is contrary to the scum wincon. If Boring was lynched D1, scum would have been in a much worse position. Prism's actual reason for scumreading Eagersnake was several levels of horrible that only sunk in once I really started thinking about and investigating it."}

You're saying that he's scum being disrespected despite doing his job well and that's why he replaced out. That's ridiculous. If you are scum, everyone dismissing you as bad town is a dream. They're the ones who'll get a shock after you win against them. I'm aware that you didn't say his arrogance was a scumtell. But even saying that he had no <span style=\"font-style: italic\">reason</span> to be arrogant is a poor argument because it's perfectly possible that Shadow thought that the Eagersnake lynch was absolutely necessary. In fact, the way he reacted to it by saying that only scum would be against it makes perfect sense with the rest of his personality and opinion of himself. He still thinks he did the right thing by pushing that lynch.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><span style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;\">@nn30</span></span><br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8591085#p8591085\">3205</a> - It's true that <span style=\"font-style: italic\">some</span> scum don't talk to their partners but what you pointed out regarding Shadow and Prism is within the margin of error. Whether or not scum talk to their partners also depends on the circumstances of the game. I will say that sometimes scum tend to push their partners without interacting with them much because when you bus, you are doing it for show and for the towncred more than you do it to sort your partners alignment which is what I suspect with Prism. Shadow was townreading Boring for most D1 for supporting his Eagersnake push. I know the townread was dumb but it's something that makes sense from his perspective. So, he didn't feel the need to talk to her very much because he had dismissed her as town. If you are town, you should also know that drastic flips can come from town. Evidence: your play this game. Shadow's flip on you isn't damning at all, since new information came to light through flips, he naturally changed his reads. I don't think Shadow's argument that there was at least one scum bussing Boring was a bad one. It's reasonable to speculate on it and work it into everything else when making a decision."}

His assertion that Shadow was town too was what was NAI-the Shadow lynch was straight up never happening Day 1 and everybody knew it. Scum Eager is forced to call him town, just like town Eager might arrive at the conclusion naturally."}

Because I gave a shit ton of reasoning. The best summary is this one but I've included others: <blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8475394#p8475394\" class=\"postlink\">post 2421</a>, Prism wrote:</cite>Only speaking for me but a few of the reasons I'm voting her are:<br>-Maria death<br>-Acknowledging why Gamma wouldn't be jailed but claims to be confused about why he died<br>-Voting LUV with me really doesn't convince me given the timing. LUV did something incredibly scummy and it doesn't take a town to see that. This may be confirmation bias speaking but a lot of her votes both today and other days seem opportunistic, ex. #1763 gives the possibility of her switching to Gamma. Kind of hypocritical of me to point out as I've said numerous times to make sure your vote is somewhere it counts, but the who it is question is still there.<br>-LUV voting Shadow then quickhammering Eager rather than just voting one of Eager/boring in a natural way to begin with is really strange if they're both town.<br>-Part of it is just me staring blankly at my computer, blankly looking at the names Dierfire/Grendel/boring/PenguinPower, and asking myself who's the most likely scum out of the 4.</div></blockquote><blockquote><div><cite>Prism wrote:</cite>There's literally no other reason to kill her [Maria] when if they weren't [correct], she's protecting scum and is a candidate for a mislynch later down the road. I think in general it points more towards boring being scum. I think not making NK speculation is a big mistake-every kill is made for a reason-out of perception of a threat, out of a desire to misdirect, or some combination thereof. My biggest strength as a player is playing the WIFOM game and winning.<br><br>boring's is a difficult read. #1609 I think brings up a good point on implosion but you don't have to be scum to find a good point. The frustration is hard to see through, last time I reread it I could see it being legitimate. I liked #1165 at the time but now I read things like this and just want to vote her for it:<br><blockquote><div><cite>In post 1165, boring wrote:</cite>I'm frankly baffled by my wagon, or that it's lasted this long. I'd congratulate scum, but I don't think they've earned it.</div></blockquote><br>What came after was better but I feel her posts are always going to come off the wrong way. However, that doesn't mean I'm wrong. The MariaR kill is a really, really good reason to vote her, especially if Gamma's report on Implosion is legitimate. She is my top fallback pick for a vote today if LUV doesn't pan out.</div></blockquote>Bonus: \"Playing the WIFOM game and winning\" in the context of a night kill does not include immediately using it to double bus the two people the kill would have been meant to protect. Call it more next level WIFOM if you want, I call it a one way ticket to being trapped solo in a town that has 3-4 mislynches and multiple PRs left.<blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8475394#p8475394\" class=\"postlink\">post 2421</a>, Prism wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>boring wrote:</cite>Prism, I'm going to need you to reread my post. I said your argument was crap because it's based on the assumption that I have the intelligence and subtlety of an Easter ham, which, frankly, anyone would find a bit insulting. Either way, it's time to move onto crazy tunnel #4. Maaaaybe PP?</div></blockquote><br>I've read it. Saying \"I'd have to be stupid to do that\" is not convincing. On the contrary, I'm suggesting that you are too intelligent to be surprised by scum's choice of kill given the knowledge that jailing Gamma is a waste of a jail, and that scum can risk one kill-less night. I also think that killing someone who is suspicious of you is a solid play. I see no reason to go on PP-the only questionable thing he's really done is overplay the brash behavior when he realized people townread it. That's scummy, sure, but that's definitely possible as town. If anything right now my second choice would be Grendel-my first impression of his case on Shadow is that he knows he's not winning vs. nn30 and needs a hail mary, especially if you're scum with him. Assuming no two death nights, scum needs at minimum 3 mislynches to win, and they're not going to make themselves. Somebody has to create them, and it's not happening if a red flip comes today.</div></blockquote>My transition was \"eh what's the first reason I see to vote while I catch up\" -&gt; \"This is really strange play\" -&gt; \"Every time I read her posts her tone gets to me, is this a me problem or a her problem?\" -&gt; \"Oh Eager probably claimed ascetic not think there'd be a town one, RIP dude\" -&gt; \"Okay Eager flipped town, back to the drawing board, that Maria kill was strange. Maybe I wasn't wrong on boring?\" into a whole bunch of other mishmash."}

Your job isn't simply to lynch Boring. It's to figure out her alignment. If you are town, you first need to interact with her, engage her, and develop your read. You said yourself that you like interacting with people to get reads so just saying that you weren't talking to Boring because people won't be convinced by that misses the point that figuring out Boring's alignment is something you should have been doing if you had suspicions that she was scum (she seemed to be in your null-scum area for most of the early game).<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8608017#p8608017\">3258</a> - I don't understand how you buy this so easily.

I'll also say I found it somewhat weird that she said Slandaar's replace out was scummy. It felt like inside info.<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8606785#p8606785\">3241</a> - I didn't find anything significant about <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8431784#p8431784\">1678</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8431786#p8431786\">1679</a>. The fact that he's responding to Boring in the way he did gives us a baseline for how he interacts with his partners. His response to Prism seems similar but I don't find it alignment-indicative.<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8606811#p8606811\">3242</a> - I think Boring was taking advantage of the cc situation. This is actually one of the things I wanted to bring up as for why my slot is town. If it was pre-determined by the scumteam that Shadow would counterclaim, wouldn't Boring have put Eager somewhere null to scum? Having Eager and Shadow both as top townreads and then having Shadow counterclaim Eager means Boring has to do a pretty big re-evaluation of her reads which shows it wasn't pre-planned. The scumteam was legit taken by surprise at this counterclaim. Then they all jumped at the opportunity. Boring on Eager and LUV on Shadow. It became apparent that they couldn't get the back to back lynches though so they seemed to have dropped the idea but I remember Boring pushing my predecessor as late as D4 so maybe not.<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8607924#p8607924\">3254</a> - This doesn't really sit right with me. Like I said, just because you decided in that scumgame, in that circumstance that bussing was a bad idea doesn't mean that you wouldn't do it in a completely different circumstance.<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8608077#p8608077\">3264</a> - I (and I assume most people who have played mafia for a while) tend to use similar kinds of rhetoric and similar case-making regardless of alignment. But it doesn't happen in the same way at the same time. Saying \"you are kidding, right?\" is more of a personality quirk. Looking over interactions is something I do as town all the time. It comes naturally to me as scum because I try to replicate my townplay the best I can.<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8608119#p8608119\">3267</a> - Implosion's post honestly didn't convince me one way or another. When I was convinced you were scum, it didn't sway me. Now when I've come around to thinking it's Prism, I guess Implosion was probably right.<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8608197#p8608197\">3273</a> - You are correct that it's totally different behavior. A few things account for this: There, I was replacing into a conf-town slot in LYLO, I had not followed that game, and was coming in with barely any information. So, I started talking to both of my lylo companions, asking them questions, and finally did a read of the game and cast my vote. Here, I was following the game since D1. I cheered when the Boring wagon cropped up. I gaped at my screen horrified when EagerSnake was getting lynched. I got annoyed when people started thinking one of the two had to be scum and Implosion and MariaR were the only ones making sense. I was surprised Boring survived as long as she did despite being scummy D1. So, when I replaced in, my reaction was noticeably different than in my other game. I wanted Boring dead as she lived way longer than she should have so started pushing the hell out of her.<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8609354#p8609354\">3284</a> - I noticed it independently, later realized you said the same thing regarding it being a co-ordinated bus. <br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8609370#p8609370\">3286</a> - That's basically where I'm at. I know I'm town so I know one of you were wrong about the other and it was easier to see Prism as the experienced player pocketing to newer player than that he's been completely and utterly oblivious to you being scum. Obviously, this is a biased reading with knowledge that I'm town.<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8610841#p8610841\">3295</a> - Like I said, just because you didn't bus once doesn't mean you won't bus in a different game even if it's at the same time. This is not a strong argument and even if you are town, I'm not making my decision based off of that.<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8610852#p8610852\">3296</a> - You made a case on Boring. You hopped onto a town led wagon in fifth place. Both of these are objective facts, not \"ideas\" that I have.<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8610971#p8610971\">3300</a> - It's true that there could be scum motivation behind posting a weak read on Dierfire and letting town lynch him without my assistance. But put yourself in my shoes: I'm town. I had a weak read on Dierfire. I thought it was most likely you but wondered if I was wrong and everyone else was right. I didn't want to take a chance at derailing a scum lynch and game end. I wasn't hard-townreading Dierfire so with a read like that, it'd be impossible to convince everyone that they were wrong.<br><br><div align=\"center\"><hr style=\"height:14px; width:100%\"></div><br>I think that's it until Prism returned.

Town rarely have \"perfect-looking play.\" Town doesn't know who scum is so play is typically more chaotic and sometimes horrendously wrong. Yours wasn't. You always had Boring and LUV as suspects. Yet, it took four days to lynch them.

You are town. You have been wrong literally every day of the game, leading on town after town. You claimed a right to the LUV lynch but never voted him and never pushed him.

Your ego inflates more as the days go by, even though you're frustrated with that darn nn30 who is still throwing a wrench in your plans and occasionally FoSing you even when everyone else hasn't. Calling him a noob seems to be getting to him and Prism both, and I mean how can he not townread your sick play? The whole game fucking hates you and trashes you but that's okay because you're clearly a rational, levelheaded person who is okay with not getting credit despite thinking it's due considering your stellar play, evidenced by your rational, levelheaded posts that matched your accomplishments ingame. It looks like Prism hates you so much that he's about to replace out over it. You really have been a dick all game, you have to say. You still hate that darned nn30 too. You think you hate this game.

You're saying that he's scum being disrespected despite doing his job well and that's why he replaced out. That's ridiculous. If you are scum, everyone dismissing you as bad town is a dream. They're the ones who'll get a shock after you win against them. I'm aware that you didn't say his arrogance was a scumtell. But even saying that he had no reason to be arrogant is a poor argument because it's perfectly possible that Shadow thought that the Eagersnake lynch was absolutely necessary. In fact, the way he reacted to it by saying that only scum would be against it makes perfect sense with the rest of his personality and opinion of himself. He still thinks he did the right thing by pushing that lynch.</div></blockquote><blockquote><div><cite>BlackVoid wrote:</cite>Wtf is this? Shadow had an ego and you didn't understand why so he's scum? You claimed to have played mafia for five years so surely it would occur to you that there are so many players who look at their town play through rose colored glasses. Who think that their scum lynch rate is absolutely awesome and when they are wrong, they just blame it on the person they mislynched because \"he shouldn't have been so damn scummy!\" Shadow being convinced that the Eager lynch was necessary was frustrating but is hardly something that you would never see from town. This entire post reads like you are manipulating nn30 and trying to make him angry that Shadow called him a newbie. Shadow's replace out was absolutely not likely to happen as mafia. I'm not even saying it wasn't alignment-indicative. I'm flat-out saying it's a towntell. As mafia, if people are dismissing you as VI-town or calling you arrogant-town, you thrive on that, you win the game, and you show them who's the VI. But as town, being disrespected can be frustrating and I assume that's why he's had enough and replaced out because of that.</div></blockquote>This is a serious double standard here. The base claim is that for someone egotistical, you only get indignant over your quality of play midgame if you're town. I definitely have gotten indignant as mafia on numerous occasions. I'm willing to bet you and BV have too. I'm definitely willing to bet Shadow did. The claim that Shadow is prone to bias and irrationality as town but a by definition an old martial arts master moving chess pieces, chuckling behind the curtain, as mafia, free from the pitfalls of pride and selfdelusion, is ridiculous.<br><br>Also, trying to use the fact that I'm <span style=\"font-style: italic\">directly responding to your question about that specific post</span> when I consider it a nonevent as evidence of further mastermind Prism manipulation is borderline hilarious. I don't even get what you find town about it let alone know how to use it to rile you up. The only thing I've riled up all game was myself over Shadow.<br><br>Maybe I'm so tired and fatigued from this marathon of a week that I can't see straight, maybe I'm not doing a good job verbalizing my thoughts, maybe I just haven't verbalized enough of them since I still have so many floating around from the paragraphs upon paragraphs of garbage selfcontradictions, but I don't see how you can view anything in the last two pages as anything but a trainwreck when you compare his statements to reality and really try to match up his thought process."}

The strength that came from me questioning reads on me all game was doublesided, 1) It served as my best vehicle for reading them and 2) It serves to cement reads on me if they turn out to have basis.<br><br>I am doing analysis on BV and more will be done, but you have to realize that the easiest way for me to show you he's scum is to show why what he's saying is bullshit.

Oftentimes, town contradict themselves because they are going over multiple theories and possibilities while trying to solve the game. These tend to come out at various points and sometimes seem inconsistent with previously stated viewpoints. I'd go so far as to say it's rarer for scum to contradict themselves because they already know the answers and have a fairly linear story that they want to sell.<br><br>As far as my read as a spectator, I had Boring, Prism, and LUV as my D1 scumteam guess as I followed the game. With LUV's lynch and scumflip, I started wondering whether I was wrong on Prism but I didn't have anyone else I could solidly slot as scum. Maybe Grendel? I wasn't paying much attention to the game at that point as I felt chances of replacing in were slim. But it was definitely a case of me thinking about both Prism-town and Prism-scum possibilities. After Grendel started towntelling and flipped town, I started wondering if it was Prism again but it wasn't really a strong, confident read. When he posted the replace out request, initial reaction was a strong \"Prism is town.\" When I replaced in, I pointed out that I thought it was Boring, Prism, and LUV but with that replace out request, I started thinking it was you or Dierfire.<br><br>Prism claims that my entire walls are riddled with contradictions. He's probably right. Heck, I called you scummy for playing both sides, then decided that your playing both sides comes from town. Interpreting events differently and considering multiple theories is just something that happens when you're comparing two sets of evidence and trying to figure out which one fits.<br><br>That's where Prism's consistency is scummy. He hasn't been doing this. I think he predicted that I'd be most likely to vote him upon a re-read of the thread  because I was scumreading his slot save for that one replace-out which I saw as a towntell whereas you and he were townreading each other throughout. So, he continued with the townread he had on you while setting himself up against me. There aren't contradictions in his posts or evolving stances where he suspects you for something, then thinks it's town and so on. There's just a linear story crafted in a way that he thinks would appeal to you. When you push him, he pushes back (mildly) but always concludes that you're more likely town - almost in a way to discourage you from attacking him.<br><br>Also, I have put in a very genuine effort at solving the game. I think this is apparent. Prism's response is to take posts out of context, slap together pairs of quotes and go \"oh, look contradiction!\""}

But bussing is actually pretty common. Your reluctance to bus isn't something that applies to everyone, and I can see why Shadow thought Eager was bussing Penguin.<br><br>I think the bigger point is just how genuine and in-depth his thought process was here. You can tell that he truly believed Eagersnake was scum because he was hunting for Eager's hypothetical buddies and analyzing how they interact with him. That's just at a level I simply found impossible for Shadow-scum to have faked even when I was reading as a spectator.<br><br>Shadow may have loved WIFOM but I don't think he's a strong enough scum player to be able to pull off what he did.

My play wasn't satisfactory in my book. It was my worst scumgame in years. And that's on me, not on you/LUV who set me up to succeed, and especially not on nn/BV who smelled blood and took home the W.

I'll post it here when it's made public.<br><br>I don't think my thoughts are necessarily any more valuable than the players'. In fact, I think there's a good argument that you all are more qualified to talk about the game, since you actually experienced its twists and turns organically, as they were intended to be experienced. My position is to provide the structure for the players to make the game their own, so I feel like my opinions are not all that important. That said, boring has asked, so here's some final thoughts. In hindsight, these are the things I will remember most about the game.<br><br><div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: setup nonsense</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display: none;\">The ascetics didn't quite play like I expected. I knew it was a possibility that one would claim and the other would counter, but for some reason I didn't expect it. You can obviously see how several roles in the game played off of it. Jailkeeper can't protect them, Doctor and Neapolitan get interesting failures, and in the Neapolitan's case it awkwardly gives them a false positive. These situations never happened, though, because the two claimed on Day one. I could have potentially fixed this by including a \"ascetic\" Mafia member, but I'd need some other stinger on their abilities in order to stop him from being a perfect Ninja. Maybe a Traitor.<br><br>One mistake on my part is that I mistook the abilities of the Jailkeeper with that of the Alien, and thought that Jailkeeper made their target untargettable by ALL actions. This would effectively stifle investigations targeting the jailed pplayer. I wrote the role card correctly, but was operating under that mistaken assumption for a while, until Zoronos claimed his abilities, and I actually PMed him about it. I ended up PMing the normal listmod about what to do also, until I realized that I was an idiot all along, and the Jailkeeper did exactly what I put in the role card, and that's what was approved in the setup review, so that's what Zoronos's abilities are.</div></div></div><br><div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: play</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display: none;\">I'm clearly coming from a special position of knowledge here, but eagerSnake was the most obvious town there could have been on day one. He claimed simple Ascetic, and Shadow counterclaimed with exactly the same, incredibly obscure role. Half of the town accurately surmised that there must be two, or ShadowStep must be pulling a really interesting gambit, but unfortunately, all three scum voted eager, and ShadowStep was far too stubborn to consider the possibility that he was wrong. He called the game bastard (which, let me finally say in thread, is an unfounded and disgusting insult from a person who clearly has no idea what that term means), and refused out of hand to accept that there exists a world where two players are Town Asectic with no other modifier or abilities. I'm sure I've said this several times by now, but Shadow, I really hope that you were humbled a bit by being so aggressively and stupidly stubborn. The mafia team used you to lynch a much more valuable player to the town, and that's entirely your fault, and nobody else's.<br><br>Moving on, lynching Dierfire was obviously wrong, since he was named as the Jailkeeper's target. It was pretty obvious that there would be no strongman, and even if there were, Strongman gets around protection, not role blocks. The only argument for Dierfire being scum was if he was a Mafia Ascetic, which I think a sane town would role out as a possibility.<br><br>The final day was incredibly disappointing to me. The lack of activity from all three players for an extended period of time was kind of demoralizing, and I almost ended up deciding to replace people. Until the last couple of days, I was hoping the scum won simply because nn30 and BlackVoid no longer deserved it. People can make the argument that Prism was inactive too, and he was, but scum have absolutely no obligation to push the game forward. In fact, I'd argue that it behooved Prism to run out the clock. Plus, he was the most active of the three during the first week+ of Day six.<br><br>While Prism may have dropped the ball a bit in the final hours, I think town clearly pulled it together and deserved it in the end. Their win is earned. Prism is still MVP.</div></div></div><br><div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: other stuff</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display: none;\">At times, this game was a blast to moderate. At times, it was very disappointing. The business between Prism and ShadowStep, and replacing, was an unnecessary fiasco, and Prism's request to replace (while understandable) was highly inappropriate. I'll point out again that if I had any suspicion that it was a gambit for towncred, rather than a legitimate outburst over dealing with a highly toxic player, I would have replaced him. Players should <span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">never</span></span> use a request to replace to alter the game. You shouldn't even state a reason for your replacement in thread. Just ask to leave, and leave.<br><br>While ShadowStep never committed any real infractions that were deserving of action on my part, part of me was happy to see him out of the game, as I believe the way he treated other players was unfair and childish. A part of me thinks \"The other players can just get over it,\" but they have no obligation to. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">This is a game</span>. It can be frustrating sometimes, but it should also be fun most of the time. If there is one thing causing the game to be consistently unfun for a good number of people, maybe that source of tension needs to be addressed. Again, I hope this doesn't fall on deaf ears.<br><br>There were also too many dealios with breaking actual site rules going on. I still can't speak on most of these issues, but if you are a culprit, I hope you know who you are, and I hope you learned a lesson at some point. Now that this game is finished, and we can talk a little more openly, if anybody wants to talk to me about a specific issue, <span class=\"noboldsig\">please</span> send me a private message, and I'll do what I can. Be incredibly cautious, though, when discussing ongoing games. If you have an issue that impacts an ongoing game in any way, <span class=\"noboldsig\">DO NOT</span> discuss it here. Period.</div></div></div><br><br><br>I will likely be running another game soon. Still not entirely sure what it will be, but I have a few ideas. Probably going to queue up today. If anybody would be interested in participating in my next game, send me a PM, and I'll make sure you're pre-inned or I'll send you a message when the game enters sign-ups."}

Mainly since a SK would be a threat to scum during the night, and can be leashed by town if found out making them as dangers as a vigilante to the mafia.

Like, if the cop clears a VT on N1, then unless scum run the table on mislynching all of the vanilla townies, or mislynch a PR (and cop/jk/deputy claims are hard mislynches), they no longer have a path to victory, and that's assuming they only kill PRs and not VTs.<br><br>So basically on a fundamental level the whole thing was super swingy as to whether town realized that the ascetics really were ascetics, since two ascetic mislynches makes the game pretty easy for scum, and the ascetics becoming self-confirmed via claim makes the game pretty easy for town."}

One ascetic claimed at day start. The other ascetic and thought the first one  was gambiting scum. He stalked him all day 1 trying to figure out who his partners were and then counter-claimed ascetic half-way through Day 1. The first ascetic advocated they were both town by the nature of his cc. It is exactly right to say \"the ascetics being self confirmed via claim makes the game pretty easy for town\" as it would have been easy had the second ascetic and a couple others believed in them both being town. Also spot on saying two ascetics mislynches makes it easy for scum as that would have put them nearly in lylo. As it happened, it took all 3 scum on the wagon to finally lynch the first ascetic D1. However the other ascetic who counterclaimed was still pretty much conf town by the nature of his claim so only 1/2 of the ascetics ended up being lynched. Cop investigated a townie N1 and a goon lynched day 2. The cop was then killed n2. Due to a questionable mass claim decision d3, and following a townies lynch, the deputy was rendered irrelevant as they were eliminated n3. The neopolitan was lynched day 4 and the jail keeper was taken out n4. Following a d5 townie lynch and the death of another townie n5, one goon, one townie, and one town ascetic were left in a final lylo situation. After two weeks of deliberation, the ascetic and townie vote to lynch the last goon to win the game. It was a close game that could have easily gone either way"}
