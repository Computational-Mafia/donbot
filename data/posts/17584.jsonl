Whats with all the sheeping anyway? - not sure why Arch is being wagoned I've not seen him as particularly scummy. Hip would probably be second pick at the moment. Still like an answer to the question of why the players (bgg, grey, akira, FD) who voted Monk didn't question his claim. Not going to let this slip easily as it must have looked a bit odd if nothing else but no-one called him out on it.<br>\n<br>\nActually Bgg looks the worst from this as he voted immediately after Monk's post. Which looks like he read Monk's post , quoted it but still didn't pick up or question the claim which makes me think<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\"> he's just taken what he wanted to see from the post</div> rather than reading it properly.

Whats with all the sheeping anyway? - not sure why Arch is being wagoned I've not seen him as particularly scummy. Hip would probably be second pick at the moment. Still like an answer to the question of why the players (bgg, grey, akira, FD) who voted Monk didn't question his claim. Not going to let this slip easily as it must have looked a bit odd if nothing else but no-one called him out on it.<br>\n<br>\nActually Bgg looks the worst from this as he voted immediately after Monk's post.

In my experience, this is an extremely powerful and consistent tell.  Mafia are in the position of needing to invent intuitive hunches out of thin air, because they already know all the roles.  In their efforts to do this, they subconsciously defend against possible criticisms before they are made without even realizing it.  <br>\n<br>\nThis is not a logically rigorous scumtell, and it's easy to find \"examples\" of other players doing similar things.  Obviously, the issue boils down to the distinction between clarifying your statements and wrapping them up in armored geometric deflectors to avoid being pinned down.  That distinction is resolved, in my opinion, only by gut reads.

I've been often accused (in other games too) of thinking about scumteams too early in the game. \"You should concentrate on the individual on D1, not the group\" they say.

He denies it (multiple times). <br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Twistedspoon wrote:</cite>oh, and you should probably claim now hiplop</div></blockquote><br>\nHiplop goes to L-1. He asks for the claim.<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>TS wrote:</cite>and Hiplop has always been a suspect although his place in my suspect list has varied at times</div></blockquote><br>\nOnce again, TS reiterates that hiplop is a suspect. TS is seriously obsessed with making sure we know he has been suspecting hiplop. Why is this? It's because <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Twistedspoon knows hiplop is flipping town.</div> And TS looks like he snuck ont he wagon near the end, it'll look scummy. Thus, he's broacasting loud and clear (over and over) how long he has suspected TS for, with the hopes that, by grounding himself as an early advocate of the wagon, he can dodge suspicion.

If TS thinks hiplop is scum, why does he care about hearing him justify his presumably bad reads? They'll fly out the window and have zero credibility the second he flips scum. The answer is because, once again, <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Twistedspoon knows hiplop is flipping town.</div> He KNOWS those reads are going to have cred tomorrow, and so he wants them squashed today before hiplop is dead and gone.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>TS wrote:</cite>^I find hiplop scummy<br>\n<br>\nthat is why I'm on the wagon</div></blockquote><br>\nPost claim, TS still finds hiplop scummy. <br>\n<br>\nhiplop asks why. TS gives a response that reaffirms hiplop's scumminess.

However, we know these cannot be TS's reasons, since he stated he still found hiplop scummy post-claim. TS is thinking these reasons up ex-post-facto to cover his mistake.

You don't have one. hiplop did not post inbetween the time you changed your read, and your 180 post was 2-3 lines long, so you clearly did not reread.

I think it's clear by now that the scum in this game aren't going to reveal themselves with transparent blunders, which means we need to smoke them out by building town lists.  People, if you are town, you NEED to start looking town.  That means:<br>\n<br>\n- Answer questions that are directed at you amicably and punctually.  All of this ego-tripping needs to stop.<br>\n- Be truthful and transparent with your reads.<br>\n- Be active.<br>\n<br>\nI put myself in the category of people who have NOT been following these guidelines so far.  I typically am a student of the Rampage school of scumhunting: confrontational, focused, and deliberately non-transparnet.  That's what I started with here, but I've come to think that this is a fairly unique town, and that this approach isn't optimal.  This town is composed of a large number of skilled players who are all being deliberately mysterious.  No one is doing anything to make the rest of the town feel comfortable about them, and it <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">isn't working</div> because scum isn't blundering.

It's because <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Twistedspoon knows hiplop is flipping town.</div> And TS looks like he snuck ont he wagon near the end, it'll look scummy. Thus, he's broacasting loud and clear (over and over) how long he has suspected TS for, with the hopes that, by grounding himself as an early advocate of the wagon, he can dodge suspicion.

The answer is because, once again, <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Twistedspoon knows hiplop is flipping town.</div> He KNOWS those reads are going to have cred tomorrow, and so he wants them squashed today before hiplop is dead and gone.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>TS wrote:</cite>^I find hiplop scummy<br>\n<br>\nthat is why I'm on the wagon</div></blockquote><br>\nPost claim, TS still finds hiplop scummy. <br>\n<br>\nhiplop asks why.

However, we know these cannot be TS's reasons, since he stated he still found hiplop scummy post-claim. TS is thinking these reasons up ex-post-facto to cover his mistake.

As I've stated clearly, <br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>archaebob wrote:</cite><br>\nI typically am a student of the Rampage school of scumhunting: confrontational, focused, and deliberately non-transparnet. That's what I started with here, but I've come to think that this is a fairly unique town, and that this approach isn't optimal. This town is composed of a large number of skilled players who are all being deliberately mysterious. No one is doing anything to make the rest of the town feel comfortable about them, and it isn't working because scum isn't blundering. I think it will be difficult for town to win in this environment unless everyone makes a concerted effort to play a more traditionally townish game.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nIt is obvious to anyone who thinks about it that I was being deliberately uncooperative towards bgg at the beginning as a tactic to see what he would do.  Since then I have added enormous amounts of content to the game and made my positions VERY clear.  The fact that you would even try and compare my early refusal to answer one or two questions to what you are doing <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">now</div>, three days from deadline, is so staggeringly off point that you are either scum or batshit insane town under the influence of your own confirmation bias.<br>\n<br>\nDo you remember Mini 873, Almaster?  Both you and I made complete asses of ourselves in that game because of outrageous arrogance and confirmation bias that ultimately destroyed town's chances of winning.  I distracted the town and made a fool of myself, and you were a VI.  How have you not learned any lessons from that?  You've now played in at least five times as many games as me, and yet your play is still as infantile as when I first met you.<br>\n<br>\nYour a joke, and you don't have nearly the pull in this town that you think you do.<br>\n<br>\nSo stop faking emotional reactions and answer my questions.  If you're really town, and you're actually interested in winning this game, then it's in your interest to appease me and make sure that the lynch still falls on one of the people you want it too.  As it is now, I wouldn't mind lynching you at all.  You're uncooperative, and a big distraction to the town.  Your play encourages apathy because of how much of a unjustifiably arrogant fuck you are, and that only hurts town more.  <br>\n<br>\nAny my gut read on you has been getting scummier and scummier over time.  I never believed your whole shouting match with Zach, because it was substanceless and contrived.  Your case on Twisted is good, but the special emphasis you put on him instead of on mikemike seems fake.  And you continue to be deliberately unproductive to prove some kind of a \"point\" to me.  I don't put this past you as a town player, because you really are a fairly pathetic piece of shit, but the bottom line is that it hurts town, could easily come from scum, and is not adding anything to the information that town has.  <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"> unvote vote Final Destination </div><br>\n<br>\n@ everyone -<br>\n<br>\nFinal Destination's giant emotional outburst in his last past is fake as shit, I'm sure you all can see that as clearly as I can.

I have absolutely zero reason to think that he's town right now, and if he won't compromise with the rest of us on any level, then I want him lynched.  He's like a VI, just with more experience.<br>\n<br>\nIf nothing else, help me wagon him until he cooperates with the questions that have been asked of him.

He had that one post in which he voted earworm that came off as weird, and he's been lurking a bit, but he's explained both of these problems rather well.  Almost all of what he says is consistent with his play.  Can someone please explain the case on him?

I succeeded in my objective.</div></blockquote><br>\nOh really? When you voted for us, we had just finished posting a massive case on Twistespoon. It was well supported and many people currently agree with it. It was Grade A content. Hell, you even said yourself that you would be willing to hammer Twistedspoon. So your demand that we needed to \"crack and post some content\" is complete and utter bullshit. We've been consistently providing good content throughout this game. <br>\n<br>\nBut apparently that wasn't enough. It was <a href=\"http://mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=3121843#p3121843%5B/url\" class=\"postlink\">this post</a>, our #709, that counted as content. What was the \"content\" of that post? It basically did two things: 1) Prove that you are scum, and 2) Tell you to fuck off and that we weren't answering your questions. Since you weren't originally asking for a case on yourself or reasons why we are town, those don't count as \"content\" you wanted to see. So let's cut everything talking about why you are scum and see what's left. <br>\n<br>\n these two choice quotes: <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>FD wrote:</cite>I'm not lowering myself to your level to appease people because I DONT CARE that scum is calling me scum.</div></blockquote><br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>FD wrote:</cite>I'm not giving out why AKIRA is a town read because theres no NEED either. Is Akira being wagonned? No. So why should I give away my townread secrets and magic... just because some scumbag asked me to and is trying to force a lynch based on my refusal? BULLSHIT.<br>\n<br>\nAkira is town. If you dumbfucks want to wagon him again, I MIGHT explain why if I feel it would derail the wagon on somehow I think is town. INSTEAD I think I'll stick to calling out the REAL SCUM for what THEY are doing and hope you punks see the light.</div></blockquote><br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>FD wrote:</cite>Mike or Twisted dies today, I don't care which. WITH THEIR SCUMFLIP BOB\"S LYNCH WILL BECOME A REALITY TOMORROW.</div></blockquote><br>\nWhat do we have? It's basically us 1) refusing to answer any of your questions and 2) telling you to fuck off. How the hell is us telling you to piss off \"content\" that generates a town read on us for you &#8230; but the massive case on Twistedspoon didn't? Bullshit. <br>\n<br>\ntl;dr - What archaebob thinks: <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">An full game of scumhunting; a well-sourced case on Twistedspoon:</div> Not content, leads to a scum read on us.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">A single post telling him that he's scum and to fuck off:</div> Content, automatically turns around his scum read on us and makes us a town read. <br>\n<br>\nThe scumteam: Twistedspoon, mike, and bob. Book it.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nYour case on Twistedspoon was good, but it wasn't alignment revealing.  Any experienced player can churn out cases like that.  <br>\n<br>\nFirst of all, let's get one thing clear: this was never about you responding to my demands.  At least, that wasn't the objective. That was just the hook by which I got some other players to vote you with me.  The bigger point, which I made clear <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">numerous</div> times, was that I didn't have a town read on you, and you were deliberately refusing to do anything that would help me.  Your twisted case is like a layup: it's good and useful to the town, but it's too easy.  I could easily see you writing that as town <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">or</div> scum, regardless of twisted's actual alliance.  <br>\n<br>\nThe posts of yours which I found to be alignment revealing were the ones in which you showed frustration, and didn't take some opportunistic measures I might have expected you to take were you scum.  Bottom line is, your response to the wagon felt consistent with a batshit insane town player who had said everything you had said up to that point.  It's a gut read.  You can say whatever you want about that \"not being content\", but as far as my read on <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">you</div> goes, it was a lot more informative than anything you've said about other players.", "time": "Sun Jun 12, 2011 6:25 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=17584&start=725", "forum": "53", "thread": "17584"}

I don't have a problem with the actual lack of reads which is the same problem I had until now. But what I don't like is that for some players he's only posted some kind of comment regarding their playstyle but with no real conclusion, which makes this list pretty useless. The only reason he made this list is for self-defense, to <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">look</div> like he's scumhunting.<br>\n<br>\nAnother alarming bit of that post is the bolded part, which is plain scum logic.

His reason for doing this was that he had \"no solid scum reads.\"<br>\n<br>\nThen he votes monk because of a comment he made about peaf.  The vote feels a little fake to me; how on earth could monk's admission that he may be biased in his opinions be scum-motivated in any way?  I don't really believe that this is a \"solid scum read,\" because akira has demonstrated in other places that he's smart enough to recognize a good argument, and this really isn't.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Akira wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Zachrulez wrote:</cite>Also feeling better about Monk and Akira after catching up on the 3 pages I've missed.</div></blockquote><br>\nWhat do you mean by better?<br>\n<br>\nRe-reading I noticed I missed a question.<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>monk wrote:</cite>@Akira, what are your thoughts on hiplop?</div></blockquote><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">I've got slight town for now.

Akira in his defense has cried playstyle, but it doesn't sit.  Especially that last sentence \"could this be considered a slight scumtell\" is just too weaksauce to be town.

Akira, why did you ask for a claim from someone you didn't actually want to lynch?  You know that this only helps scum.<br>\n<br>\nI'm of the opinion that the scumteam analysis isn't worth all that much, because I have no idea how that would work in the way akira describes without running into lots of wifom.  I also agree with Zach about him arbitrarily dropping names from it, Empking in particular.  However, the fact that he's trying to do an analysis like this at all suggests that he may be town.<br>\n<br>\nI go after him with my first case, and his response is strong and assertive.  Answers well, and then shrugs off my rebuttal with a giant fuck you to the face.  This is the other bit that still bothers me...with some of his earlier play being as tentative as it was, his response to me feels over-compensated, like he was trying to show me just how unintimidated he was.<br>\n<br>\nHe also sheeps onto FD's case:<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Akira wrote:</cite>Well, bob, if you're going to lynch me based on my way of speech, then I'm going to stop wasting my time.<br>\n<br>\nRegarding Twisted, I like the case. I have never put much thought into Twisted, and after ISOing him several times I never noticed his scummy stance on hiplop, probably because I was looking at his posts without looking at the context.<br>\nTwisted wasn't on my scumteam list because, assuming three-man scumteams, the only possible buddy seemed to be mikemike.<br>\nBut hey, what about bussing?<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Twisted</span> I agree with FD's points and I like the case. Twisted is scummy. This is much better than relying on my list.<br>\nOf course mikemike is his buddy though.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nAll of his excuses for having not noticed how scummy Twisted was himself feel fake and premature.  I don't like the fact that he sheeps onto FD's case either, especially with his statements at the end pretty much explicitly saying that he was handing over the reigns of his own judgment.  I'm also not sure I understand why he suspects mikemike enough to declare him as a buddy.<br>\n<br>\nAkira, do you value your scumteam analysis or not?  This whole vote seems like you opportunistically sheeped over to Twisted, and then inserted a bunch of little comments to explain why you didn't already feel this way before.  It's random and overlydefensive.  FD's case was good, and I can understand why you might like it, but this isn't how I would expect you to tell the world that you've changed your mind.

This is all ultimately rooted in gut, and I find Twisted's stupid defenses more believable than Akira's.    <br>\n<br>\nIn any case, I've definitely realized that my akira case isn't all that solid after actually making it.  I really don't know what to tell you though, my gut says town on Twisted.  I can't imagine what you think I gain from taking this stance; at the very least my refusal to sheep onto your wagon is WIFOM and therefore null.  If I sheeped you would call me scum, and because I'm not sheeping you say I'm \"desperately trying to avoid his lynch.\"  Do I really seem that noobish to you?  C'mon man.  You have to give me enough respect to realize that I'm definitely not noob scum literally trying to keep his partner alive.  I'm either town who actually doesn't agree with you, or I'm scum refusing to make the obvious move as part of some wifom gambit thing.  <br>\n<br>\nIn general, your argument against me needs to become a lot more nuanced before I'm going to take it seriously.  <br>\n<br>\nFor example: if you were to do metaresearch on me you would find that I pretty consistently bus like a bitch when I'm scum.  Now if Twisted were to flip scum, would my refusal to \"bus\" him make me more likely to be town in this game?  Absolutely not.  Could I pretend it does?  Sure.<br>\n<br>\nYou could do even more metaresearch on me and find that my town play always looks like someone who changes their style deliberately to fit the situation, and gets his lynches done with a combination of Rampage style anger and creepy appeals to the rest of the town for their cooperation.  Does that make me more likely to be town in this game?  No, of course not.  Could I pretend it does?  Sure.<br>\n<br>\nI don't expect any of this to make a difference to you right now, because you are so overwhelmingly convinced of your current position that you'll interpret any post from me as scum-motivated.  That's easy to do with the right set of premises: when I make the obvious move I'm desperate scum who doesn't know better, and when I make the less obvious move I'm manipulative scum who's shenanigans become clear under close inspection.  Your read on me isn't scientific at all; for some reason you decided that I was scum as soon as I went after akira, and since then you've warped everything else to fit that view.  I really hope you can look at my play with a cooler head tonight and not screw over the town tomorrow with an epic you vs me.

I wanted to hear his claim because it would give me a good idea of his alignment. I had already decided beforehand that if hiplop claimed VT he'd be town. It would have also helped me with my scumteam analysis, since I could cross out one more player from the list. And I did just that.<br>\n<br>\nMy analysis is absolutely not random.

But I'll regurgitate them for you and you don't even need to ask nicely plus add some other general comments.<br>\n<br>\nFD's play has been pretty awful really and should be lynched but I guess its not going to happen. As I've said I think its unlikely that both him and Akira are both scum, its almost certainly one or the other. Same with Grey - there's no way they'd put themselves both on the firing line so if FD is scum, Grey probably isn't. His lynch will be extremely informative so hopefully you guys go that way tomorrow if I'm not about.<br>\n<br>\nAkira would be my next pick - had a scum read on him all game, the only real concern and thing that would make me reluctant about lynching him is I don't think both him and FD are scum unless its a triple bluff from FD.<br>\n<br>\nNext up ... Ear's suspicion remains in my eyes and probably needs a good ISO. His L1 vote read opportunistic scum all over. And I'm not convinced he's made a single useful post so far in the game.<br>\n<br>\nBgg .. His vote for Monk looks awful. Read it through again if I go. How can you read a post, quote it, decide its scummy but miss the damn soft claim ? Beggers belief.<br>\n<br>\nTwisted - Maybe I'm missed something but I just have a neutral read on him. Just don't get the case on him at all.<br>\n<br>\nGrey - linked with FD and a scum flip on FD would help clear this one up. As it stands his sheeping of FD with zero justification looks bad. And these are wagons which have been very useful to scum. Still think of the two, an FD lynch would be far more useful as it will tell you about Akira as well.<br>\n<br>\nBob - Playing very-very pro-town. Maybe I'm not experienced enough to detect fake pro-town play but I just don't see hm being scum yet.<br>\n<br>\nZach - actually you seem about the only person on my wagon to have actually attempted to justify it. Obviously I think you are talking bollocks but your entry onto the wagon does seem pretty consistent with your overall play throughout the day and less fake than most of them. Not got any real scum read on you.<br>\n<br>\nMonk/Arch - Believe their claim 99% even if they have been pretty useless the rest of the time.<br>\n<br>\nSo to summarise if you can't be bothered to read the above, my list of top suspects:<br>\n<br>\n1.

{"number": 947, "id": "3139777", "user": "archaebob", "user_id": "12231", "content": "So to begin with, I realize that I was all over the place yesterday, and that I've flip flopped quite dramatically more than once in a very short period of time.  I was also completely wrong about mikemike (I kind of realized it right before the lynch but it was way too late for me at that point).  This is my first game in nine months, and I simply haven't had my head screwed on right.  Also, I should mention (especially since I'm now at L-1) that this is my first time ever playing a town PR, and it's really been fucking with me.<br>\n<br>\nAnd on that note, I claim <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Doctor</div>.<br>\n<br>\nTypically, I try to play as the vanilla town from hell.  I'm very abrasive at first, and then analytical later.  My town career got off to a rough start, but recently this style has worked well for me.<br>\n<br>\nIn my first three games as town, I played rashly and was mostly wrong about scum.  The town lost all three games, and I was largely at fault each time.  However, I decided not to change my fundamental play style, and instead to just work on becoming more accurate in my reads.<br>\n<br>\nI've linked my last two games as town below, because I think it's important context for what I'm trying to say:<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=11&amp;t=14637&amp;start=0\" class=\"postlink\">Newbie 983</a> - dominated town discussion for the whole game, along with foilist13.  Correctly identified scum on page 7, got them lynched, and won on D2 with a cop result. <br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&amp;t=14954\" class=\"postlink\">Mini 1026</a> - Correctly called out all three scum D1, and after a long war of wall posts, got them killed in quick succession without a single town death.  The game was a perfect D2 win.  I don't know of any other mini normals where this has happened.  I was even nominated briefly for a scummy.<br>\n<br>\nThat was all last summer.  I go back to school for nine months and don't play at all during that time period.  When I get back, I figure replacing into a 15 page game is a decent way to get back into things, so I go ahead and /in as a replacement for peaf.  <br>\n<br>\nAnd then I'm told that I'm the doctor.  I've never played a town PR before, and have up until this point been building a meta of dominant vanilla townie.  What the hell am I supposed to do?  I read some theory, but that only makes it worse by putting me more in my head.<br>\n<br>\n...<br>\n<br>\nListen guys, I really tried, and I really fucked it up.  The entire day yesterday was very stressful and difficult for me.  I knew that as a matter of theory I was supposed to be trying to find the cop and avoiding the NK, but I was worried that I would draw attention to myself if I kept a low profile because of my meta.  All the time I spent thinking about this made many of my posts and actions yesterday seem contrived, because they were.  At one point through the day I basically just said \"fuck it\" and decided to just start playing as if I was vanilla; however, I wasn't confident in any of my reads because of all the lurkers.  I've always been a notorious hunter of lurkers, and the towns I've played in before this game were all much more malleable.  In this particular game, I've really been psyched out quite a bit by players who post next to nothing about their opinions and are enabled in doing so by the rest of the town.  With no way to intimidate anyone, and with FD asserting very loudly and with a lot of confidence that I was scum basically from the moment I went after akira (which I still think is bullshit), I got drawn into a personality driven stand off.  Of course, I'm insecure about my confirmation bias because of my bad history with it.  Also, as a replacement, I kept rereading the thread and noticing new things that I hadn't noticed before, and on a couple occasions this drastically altered my attitude towards a player.  I flip-flopped, overcompensated, flip-flopped some more, and then tried to scumhunt a completely new player as the lynch was in the process of going through.  I can only imagine how all of this looked to the outside observer, especially ones who have some sense of how I usually play.<br>\n<br>\nI don't expect this claim to exonerate me.  But I DO expect those of you voting me to act with some sense.<br>\n<br>\n1) I'm not a newb.  There are a lot of bullshit points that have been brought against me that only make sense if you think of me as an unusually short-sighted player.  For example, some of you spent yesterday literally accusing me of \"defending my scumbuddy\".  Yeah, ok, maybe I was.  But if that's what I was doing, then I was doing it as part of a wifom gimmick, not because I'm literally that stupid.  You need to be honest with yourself and recognize that I'm equally likely to just be misguided town who didn't agree with you.  Both are equally plausible, and those of you who have made this accusation need to make a much more nuanced argument about why I necessarily come up on one side of the table instead of the other.<br>\n<br>\n2) You aren't 100% positive I'm scum.  That means you should actually make a case.  Right now I don't really understand why half you guys think I'm scum.  Seriously, iso the players on this wagon.  A lot of you have gotten away with murder as far as posting reads and justifying votes is concerned.  Treat me with enough respect to make real arguments against me, so that I have at least the opportunity to defend myself.  <br>\n<br>\n3) A lot of bullshit happened at the end of the day yesterday, and I'm amazed that you guys aren't seeing it.  In particular, Zach's play has really gotten my attention.  I'll get into this more later.<br>\n<br>\n4) It's very risky for me to try and make this point right now, but I think the Greymarble lynch doesn't fit in very comfortably with the official story of \"epic town FD caught all three scum day 1.\"  My gut thinks scum may have killed who they saw as a dangerous dissenting voice to their agenda.  I know it's wifom, but it should at least make you stop in your tracks.  <br>\n<br>\nThere's a lot more to talk about, but I need to go sleep right now.<br>\n<br>\nFinal words:<br>\n<br>\nI played like shit yesterday and I'm sorry.<br>\n<br>\nNow that I've claimed I'll be a lot more comfortable with myself, and I'm confident that I can gain back some cred if you give me room to post content and actually take my cases seriously.<br>\n<br>\nConsider a few suggestions:<br>\n<br>\n1) I'm already at L-1.  I might be scum, but I might not be, and if scum is in anyway pushing this lynch, you guys are going to want to have a lot more discussion today than you have so far.  I have cases I plan to make, and I can't see a scenario in which it isn't pro town for you to look at them.  So I ask that someone please unvote.<br>\n<br>\n2) FD decided that I was scum as soon as I went after akira, and the rest of you have pretty much just sheeped him.  I understand that my play so far has been poor, but I ask that you maintain enough self-doubt to deal with this day sanely, and give me a legitimate chance to defend myself.  Why am I scum exactly?  You should demand that people post a case answering this question not only for <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">my</div> sake, but so that you can be sure that <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">their</div> intentions are sincere as well.  I mean, fuck, just LOOK at the people on my wagon!!  Do <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">you</div> know what their reasons really are?<br>\n<br>\nI don't know how much time I will have tomorrow, but I definitely will be posting a lot more before the weekend is over.<br>\n<br>\nSimul Edit:<br>\n<br>\nSo I'm not at L-1 anymore, but I'm still claiming.  I recognize that in most situations this would not be the ideal play, but given the circumstances, I think it's my best option.  I can't really defend myself honestly without it.
