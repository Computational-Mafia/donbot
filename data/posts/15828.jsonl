So, there you have it.  I find it strange you're casting a vote on the inactive rather than focusing on people who have obviously been scummy.  To me that's a scummy vote in and of itself, especially this early in the game.  But I can see potential, if not misguided, town motivation behind it. Unlike:<br><br>@ Amor, your post above is scummy as hell.  If I wasn't so sure Pinewolf deserved my vote right now you'd get it.  You say an awful lot about people who may be scum and then vote for someone who hasn't posted.  Voting for lurkers this early is anti-town because if they're not posting they'll get prodded or replace out, and they make for easy bandwagons instead of legitimate scumhunting targets.

You're trying to argue that it's scummy to ask questions in one's first post, instead of immediately voting.  That it's scummy to work with other players, instead of ignoring what they're arguing.  And that's not getting into all the other stuff you've made up, which I've shown in black and white are made up: about me \"forgetting things\" (I didn't) or that I \"didn't directly answer your question\" (I did).

You're looking for \"scummy middle ground\".  There it is.  Or, more likely, there's your partner.<br><br>I mean, not even Amor is foolish enough to try to argue this illogic against me.  Granted, that's probably because Amor's trying to slink out of the limelight, doing his damnedest not to draw my further attention.  Honestly, that might be the best argument in favor of your innocence: that Amor is playing dead and hoping that you draw my fire (maybe while IS or RC try to redirect attention elsewhere?) but I can still see likely scenarios where you and he are partnered.<br><br><br>IS:<br>Speaking of which, what is the reason for your sudden silence regarding Amor?  Did he do something protown since that FOS and IGMEOY you gave him?

I understand life is happening (Christmas and all) but I'd imagine he could come in and quickly derail the joke wagon on himself with little difficulty.

I'll tell you IT'S NOT<br><br>2. about my posting, just because it may not be aparant to you right now, doesn't mean it doesn't help the town later. If one of these lurkers starts posting more and happens to make a slip OR one of these lurkers starts posting and finds something we all missed, than I have helped the town. I don't see how me encouranging the quiet people to post is hurting the town in anyway. If me encouraging the town is hurting town, please show me how it is hurting.

You are making an assumption based on something that can't even be verified. You can't verify that scum wants to end RVS OR prolong it, because every group of scum is different.<br><br>4. and finally, your last part towards Amor, you want him to confirm me as scum and you will look for the other, that means you think Amor is scum number 1 SO....<br><br>Why the fuck are you not voting him if you think he is scum number one?

Or Scum. Actually youre probably a idiotic filthy liar scum. SB is also the largest bandwagon, which is conveniently tied with yours. As I said, I think SB is scum as well as you. SB has just been a vote monkey looking to latch on to anything thats viable while providing little content. You have just been inconsistent with your attacks and antagonizing everyone with your empty assessments. I call you out on your sillyness, so that makes me scum?</div></blockquote><br><br>This is the second time you've accused me of lying with nothing to back it up.  I never claimed I was the largest wagon, but your voting me was (did) make me largest, and so it would have been a more effective place for your vote if you genuinely believed both SB and I were scum.  I'd also like to call attention to the last two lines, which are the kind of fact-free vitriol IS has posted throughout the game. What inconsistencies or \"empty assessments\" are you referring to?  How am I supposed to defend myself against something like that?<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Internet Stranger wrote:</cite>Part of my voting on SB is to assert myself as being serious as his scum vibes. Besides, I voted for him first before the Pinewolf discussion was over. Which by the way, that was a bandwagon SB was on.</div></blockquote><br><br>So wait, SB is scummy for being on the bandwagon you started, whereas I'm scummy for arguing against that bandwagon?  And the fact that you abandoned the PW wagon once it actually started acquiring votes is just another instance of you throwing tons of invective at someone and then making sure you don't have your vote on them when it actually matters.<br><br>It's also nice to know that your main concern is how you look and not getting rid of scum.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>IS wrote:</cite>I cant lynch scum by myself. I cant force people to vote along with my suspicions. All I can do is point them out and let the mob go all townie style on them. Which is precisely what im doing with Scott. See for yourself, are you seriously trying to say that my behavior is any more scummy than his?</div></blockquote><br><br>So, you can't lynch scum by yourself, but you are able to point to people and have \"the mob\" (clearly all town members except for Glorious Leader IS) all vote for them?  And your being only one person is exactly the point I was arguing -- that you should have been working with ET instead of off on your own wagon, if you really believe what you claim to.<br><br>As far as SB goes, I still think he's possible scum, and if anything the way you've gone out of your way to go \"LOOK I'M SUSPECTING THIS GUY\" makes me think you're getting some bussing in.  Still, I'd like to wait until you're confirmed as scum before I start focusing on your connections.<br><br>The rest of the post is more useless vitriol.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>EmpTyger wrote:</cite>The going-out-in-a-blaze-of-WIFOM gambit. A little earlier than typical, but it'll make for an interesting D2.</div></blockquote><br><br>Can you explain what you mean by this?<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Guderian wrote:</cite>Amor, tell me why the people voting you shouldn't be voting you.</div></blockquote><br><br>Er, because I'm town?  Honestly, I'm doing my best to respond to the case on me (if you can even call it such), but most of it is just vague assertions of scumminess.  ET pointed to some flimsy connection between me and Gud and that's about it, and I've addressed IS's big post above.  I've been posting content throughout the game and have tried to argue logically and not emotionally.  Granted, it took me a while to get a solid scum read on anyone due partly to getting caught up in a stupid meta argument with IS (which might have been part of his plan) and partly because I don't want to tunnel vision, but I don't see how that makes me super-scummy.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>EmpTyger wrote:</cite>Ignore Gud. Tell me more about why the people *not* voting you *should* be voting you.</div></blockquote><br><br>Because it's the cool thing to do, I guess.  If this is about IS, I become suspicious when someone is loudly arguing that someone is scum but not voting them.  If you genuinely think I'm the scummiest person here, you should be voting me.  As I mentioned above, it doesn't seem like there's a good reason for that, but if that's your opinion then the town move would be to throw a vote down.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Shattered Viewpoint wrote:</cite>I do not at all like Amor's iso5; overall, (gasp!)

Also games I have played where I have been scum, my partners have lurked.</div></blockquote><br>Where exactly did you \"disprove\" it? That was complete WIFOM. If you need me to explain why again, just say so. How many games have you played here(note: if you're talking about games somewhere else it doesn't count)?

You are either Pro Town or Scum so you are not making a very good point here at all.<br><br>2. I am not twisting anything, you said Scum prolong RVS. themanhimself said he saw 2 scum try to end rvs.  You said just because 2 scum try to end rvs early it doesn't mean that it will happen alot and i said that doesn't mean it won't happen alot.  I went on to say that your comment about it doesn't mean it will happen alot is an assumption that can't be verified one way or the other. I did not twist anything<br><br>3. Sorry it doesn't work like that, you don't say to one person. \"hey scum please tell me this other guy is scum because I want to lynch him and I want to make sure he is scum before I do it\" which is essentially what you did. You ARE calling Amor scum and you want scum to confirm I am scum, this means you just contradicted yourself.  If you thought I am the scum, you would be asking me to confirm amor as the other scum not the other way around, get it?  this is probably your biggest slip up right here.  You think Amor is scum you should be voting him. And just so there is no confusion I bolded your statement<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>WeirdRa wrote:</cite><span class=\"noboldsig\">Amor, you could make life easy and confirm RC as one of your buddies right now. I prefer a challenge though, so leave the third one a mystery. </span>Let us hang the scumbag ourselves, finding him on our own.<br>~A</div></blockquote><br><br>This is clear as day that Amor is your number 1 scum read and you want to find the other 2. <span class=\"noboldsig\">CONTRADICTION</span><br><br>4. nice try to side-step this one with a confusing response. yes you are saying his experiences don't have an impact on THIS game, however you want us to allow YOUR expereinces to have an impact.  if HIS don't have an impact YOURS don't either.  Which means your WIFOM about \"scum wanting to prolong RVS\" is discredited just as much as his \"I saw scum try and end rvs early\"  the only thing that rings 100% truth is my statement. \"what scum does each game differs because the scum team themselves are different, you can't say scum does this or scum does that because unless you are scum, you don't know what they are capable of doing\" and that is not WIFOM, that is undeniable truth.  You find one person that says every game they have been in scum has done the exact same thing every single time, than you have disproven my statement but that person is like the tooth fairy or santa claus, they don't exsist.<br><br>5. This isn't arrogance, this is I am pretty sure after your attempts to twist thinsg I say and than accuse me of twisting words, plus all of the other reasons I have provided I think you are scum and your play has shown it.  if the others don't agree with me, i can't help that but my case on you is strong and I will urge people to read up on you also."}

Use of WIFOM when he says \"scum likes to prolong RVS\" but when themanhimself says that he has seen scum try and end it early, he just writes him off.

He asks Amor to confirm me as his other scum buddy, the ONLY WAY he would ask Amor to confirm me as his other scum buddy would be A. he thinks armor is scum B. he thinks I am sure but wants confirmation from Amor to be sure.

Which means your WIFOM about \"scum wanting to prolong RVS\" is discredited just as much as his \"I saw scum try and end rvs early\" the only thing that rings 100% truth is my statement. \"what scum does each game differs because the scum team themselves are different, you can't say scum does this or scum does that because unless you are scum, you don't know what they are capable of doing\" and that is not WIFOM, that is undeniable truth.

Care to point out where? More to the point, it is completely arrogance. \"and this is where I am sticking until I see some noticeable improvement in Weird's play, but right now he is my pick for scum.\" You're saying that we're horrible players, and your much better than us, and that us being bad(which we're not) means we're scum.

If he and I made it to LYLO that could in fact be the difference between winning and losing the game.<br><br>The survey was to get different versions of the same content from every player so it could be compared and analyzed. In retrospect some of the questions weren't very helpful, but I strongly believe that none of it was anti-town. Scum want as little information as possible to come out because it helps mislynches and on a long enough timeline all scum will slip in some way or another.<br><br>- His posts are half-rant which I never like and in my experience has a strong anti-town correlation.<br><br>- He originally said the survey wasn't a bad idea but after IS and SS22 condemned it he jumped on board. Since both of those players have seemed scummy to me I see that as a scumlink.<br><br>- The cases he makes are just hollow in general in my opinion which to me seems like someone seeking a mislynch.<br><br>- He says Amor and I are scumbuddies even though I've voted Amor several times and have criticized many of his posts. Albeit, until Amor's last post I did make the case that he was town, but just because I defend someone doesn't make me their scumbuddy, particularly when you put it in context.<br><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>RobCapone wrote:</cite>Weird asked Armor to confirm me as his scum buddy, Weird said Armor was his #2 pick for scum and I was his number 1<br><br>My question is would you really ask your 2nd scum read to confirm your 1st scum read as scum?<br><br>I would think it would be the other way around, you would ask who you think is most likely to be scum to confirm your 2nd read as scum and using my thinking, than why would he be voting for me if he thought Armor was his number 1 scum read.<br><br>The fact that he even asked the question seems fake, I just can't shake the feeling that Armor and Weird are in it together, especially since Weird isn't even commenting on the Armor case and he has the largest wagon, TO ME it seems like he is trying to divert attention from the Armor wagon</div></blockquote><br><br>-This whole thing about not knowing that Weird was joking when he asked Amor to confirm Rob as his scumbuddy is just ridiculous as all hell and the fact that he tried to defend tells me that he's taking it too seriously (like a paranoid mafioso would)<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>RobCapone wrote:</cite>Wow I'm suprised people find me scummy &lt;sarcasm&gt;<br><br>This is nothing new for me obviously, I'm accused of scum almost every game I have played as rob and as homj</div></blockquote><br><br>-This post is wrong on so many levels. He's trying to deflate the case against him with sarcasm without actually posting anything. That thing about his meta is totally unsubstantiated and basically defends his right to be scummy whenever he wants.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>RobCapone wrote:</cite>Scumhunting is scummy how?</div></blockquote><br><br>-After I say that maybe the fact that he's frequently seen as scum is indicative of something in his playstyle, he posts this. It's a total logical fallacy because no one accused him of scum-hunting too hard (which would be ridiculous in and of itself) and it's just him trying to give himself another excuse to be totally scummy whenever he wants."}

As his body relaxed your searched his pockets, took his key and lead the way to his room.<br><br>You stumbled with the lock on his draw as your nervously unlocked it.<br><br>You opened the draw.<br><br>You grabbed the letter.<br><br>You didn't need to say anything, the others could tell by the bleak look on your face how things had turned out.</div></blockquote><br><br><span style=\"color: #800000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Themanhimself</span>,</span></span> <span style=\"color: #0040FF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Vanilla Townie</span></span><span style=\"color: #800000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"> lynched day one.<br><br>You have until 12am, January 8 to send in any night actions.</span></span>"}

Also, on this point, everyone needs to click on page 6 and scroll to the bottom, and read SV's post 149.  It's atrocious, given that we now know WeirdRa was in fact scum.

So much sense that I'm going to, for the moment, forgive the little footnote to WeirdRa at the end of the post.<br><br>WeirdRa again mentions RC in post 175.  The constant mentioning of both Amor and RC from my scum reads is interesting.  Post 176 from RC to Weird seals the deal on this vote.  He's OMGUSing his scum buddy from his scum buddies sudden and rather uncalled for busing of him.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: RobCapone</span><br><br>Which makes EMP a town read for now.<br><br>How the hell did 7 votes magically swing onto TMHS between Dec 23rd and Jan 2nd?

He relies on Lynch All Liars as a basis for argument against him, and there was a lie there.<br><br>Also, RC, the reason you used to vote for TMHS in 241 (he said he'd be willing to lynch you or amor) doesn't fit.  I had, previously, said I'd be willing to lynch either of two different targets (amor or TMHS) and you didn't use that as a diving board to attack me.  Which means this reads as either an OMGUS, defensive move, or at minimum, inconsistency in your reasons for voting to lynch people.  What made this situation different from the other ones up until that point, where people had said they were comfortable lynching one of two people?  I do give you the scum-tell you establish later down the same page, but it seemed at the time like your vote revolved around the former idea.<br><br>I once again find myself in agreement with Emp's thoughts on post 258.<br><br>Now onto D2:<br><br>Post 412 is a blatant attempt at town points.

And lying is not the only way to be an idiot.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">tmh was innocent</span>.  Get that through your head.  It has nothing to do with lying about his role, because you decided he was ironclad guilty long before that, based on your made-up \"scumtells\" that you still won't admit are bogus even though you just lynched someone for them who was innocent.<br><br>I have my rebuttal of [435] typed up but for some reason it\u2019s not posting with quote tags.  Going para by para:<br><br>1) No, because what you call a case is your made-up scumtells and things out of context and illogical arguing.  Of course you\u2019re not going to agree with a case when you refuse to look at context and refuse to subscribe to logic.  <br><br>2) No, I explicitly did so, in [206], immediately after you asked:<br><span style=\"font-style: italic\">\u201cSV indicated a post where Amor attacked IS for how he was trying to get the game moving, without Amor doing anything himself to get the game moving, which Amor said was necessary to be doing.\u201d</span><br><br>3) No, WR explicitly refused to vote Amor!  How are WR and I \u201cperfect little scum buddies\u201d if WR say Amor was suspicious, but then refuse to vote Amor, effectively stalling out the Amor wagon and directly resulting in Amor not getting lynched?  Why would mafia conspire to *not* mislynch an innocent? <br><br>4) No, a player who tries to stop innocents from being lynched is *protown*.  <br>Get this through your head.<br>The town is trying to lynch *mafia*.  Not \u201cplayers of whatever alignment who violate RC\u2019s made-up standards\u201d.<br><br>5) No, because here\u2019s the actual context you\u2019ve removed and ignored:<br>Gud in [213]: <span style=\"font-style: italic\">\u201cWhat you are implying here is that only the bandwagons you are selling are legitimate.\u201d</span><br>Tyger in [233]: <span style=\"font-style: italic\">\u201cAmor is a legitimate bandwagon because, as I explained, a majority of the players are selling it.\u201d</span><br><br>A <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">majority of players</span> at the time had expressed suspicion of Amor.  If a majority of players already believe Amor is mafia, there\u2019s no need to give further explanations.  The primary issue at that point is to get those players who are *saying* Amor is suspicious to put their money where their mouth is and *vote* Amor.  The first step?  Correcting how Gud is trying to downplay this as only coming from me when it\u2019s actually a majority.<br><br>And then look what happened.  WR had *said* Amor was suspicious, but when the time came, he refused to vote.  And the bandwagon stalled.  And you decide to mislynch an innocent.<br><br>6) No, that\u2019s not how logic works.  You made a baseless assumption (that Gud is my top suspect), you found that the evidence doesn\u2019t support that (since, as I said explicitly, Amor was my top suspect), and rather than make the conclusion that your initial assumption was faulty, you decide that I must have been lying because your assumptions trump the events of the actual thread.  And you decide must be mafia because anyone who disagrees with your baseless assumptions is mafia.  The logical conclusion is that your assumptions are wrong.  Which would bring you to a conclusion which fits the events of the thread: that Amor is my top suspect.<br><br>And this is this exact same thing you did with tmh.  How did that work out again?<br><br>7) I can\u2019t even begin to untangle the illogic here.

And lying is not the only way to be an idiot.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">tmh was innocent</span>.  Get that through your head.  It has nothing to do with lying about his role, because you decided he was ironclad guilty long before that, based on your made-up \"scumtells\" that you still won't admit are bogus even though you just lynched someone for them who was innocent.<br><br>I have my rebuttal of [435] typed up but for some reason it\u2019s not posting with quote tags.  Going para by para:<br><br>1) No, because what you call a case is your made-up scumtells and things out of context and illogical arguing.  Of course you\u2019re not going to agree with a case when you refuse to look at context and refuse to subscribe to logic.  <br><br>2) No, I explicitly did so, in [206], immediately after you asked:<br><span style=\"font-style: italic\">\u201cSV indicated a post where Amor attacked IS for how he was trying to get the game moving, without Amor doing anything himself to get the game moving, which Amor said was necessary to be doing.\u201d</span><br><br>3) No, WR explicitly refused to vote Amor!  How are WR and I \u201cperfect little scum buddies\u201d if WR say Amor was suspicious, but then refuse to vote Amor, effectively stalling out the Amor wagon and directly resulting in Amor not getting lynched?  Why would mafia conspire to *not* mislynch an innocent? <br><br>4) No, a player who tries to stop innocents from being lynched is *protown*.  <br>Get this through your head.<br>The town is trying to lynch *mafia*.  Not \u201cplayers of whatever alignment who violate RC\u2019s made-up standards\u201d.<br><br>5) No, because here\u2019s the actual context you\u2019ve removed and ignored:<br>Gud in [213]: <span style=\"font-style: italic\">\u201cWhat you are implying here is that only the bandwagons you are selling are legitimate.\u201d</span><br>Tyger in [233]: <span style=\"font-style: italic\">\u201cAmor is a legitimate bandwagon because, as I explained, a majority of the players are selling it.\u201d</span><br><br>A <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">majority of players</span> at the time had expressed suspicion of Amor.  If a majority of players already believe Amor is mafia, there\u2019s no need to give further explanations.  The primary issue at that point is to get those players who are *saying* Amor is suspicious to put their money where their mouth is and *vote* Amor.  The first step?  Correcting how Gud is trying to downplay this as only coming from me when it\u2019s actually a majority.<br><br>And then look what happened.  WR had *said* Amor was suspicious, but when the time came, he refused to vote.  And the bandwagon stalled.  And you decide to mislynch an innocent.<br><br>6) No, that\u2019s not how logic works.  You made a baseless assumption (that Gud is my top suspect), you found that the evidence doesn\u2019t support that (since, as I said explicitly, Amor was my top suspect), and rather than make the conclusion that your initial assumption was faulty, you decide that I must have been lying because your assumptions trump the events of the actual thread.  And you decide must be mafia because anyone who disagrees with your baseless assumptions is mafia.  The logical conclusion is that your assumptions are wrong.  Which would bring you to a conclusion which fits the events of the thread: that Amor is my top suspect.<br><br>And this is this exact same thing you did with tmh.  How did that work out again?<br><br>7) I can\u2019t even begin to untangle the illogic here.  You are arguing that I\u2019m mafia, because I said that you weren\u2019t making sense, about something that you now think isn\u2019t true\u2026?<br><br>Seriously, read your posts.  Maybe even out loud.  <br><br>8) No, the actual context was that I was making an exactly paralleling post in order to demonstrate how a certain behavior wasn\u2019t suspicious, contrary to what Gud was arguing.  I\u2019m sure the wildly inaccurate conclusions you reach when you take something out of context are pretty hilarious.<br><br><br>Also, I still don\u2019t get why you alluded to Fringe mafia, except to demonstrate that you\u2019re such an abysmally bad player that you\u2019re actually *proud* of how abysmally bad a player you are.  <br>You insist that whenever you mislynch an innocent, it is the lynched players' fault, but whenever you get lynched, it's the mafia's fault.<br>You didn\u2019t \u201cnail\u201d 2 mafia in that game.

The town lost.</div></blockquote><br><br>1. yes after the fact he was innocent but he was guilty of scummy play, clearly other town thought so too, just because you didn't doesn't mean that he wasn't scummy<br><br>2. I did not make up scum tells, TMH posted what he said was a scum tell AND I pointed out how he was guilty of doing it, maybe HE made it up, but he said it was a scum tell and he did it.  Also he asked the town's opinion for his vote, if you are town you stand by your votes and FUCK anyone else who doesn't agree with it. You stand up for your vote because it is yours, asking opinions of others seemes like he was trying to not upset the rest of the town, this is also scummy play.<br><br>3. you realize mafia isn't always going to be on the same bandwagon right? I have seen games where mafia even tried to build a case on another mafia. There are all kinds of tricks but the fact remains that Weird was saying Amor was scummy but tried to de-rail the wagon by starting one on me. What was his motivation? I have no clue.  Also the last post in that 206 that tries to belittle my case on Weird can be thorwn out the window because <span class=\"noboldsig\">I WAS FUCKING RIGHT</span> and teh fact that you say you aren't going to chanse after him to me is either proof that A. you are his scum buddy or B. you aren't very good at this game.  I haven't quite figured it out yet.<br><br>4. <blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>No, a player who tries to stop innocents from being lynched is *protown*.  </div></blockquote> so you knew he was pro-town?<br><br>5. <blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><span style=\"font-style: italic\">\u201cAmor is a legitimate bandwagon because, as I explained, a majority of the players are selling it.\u201d</span></div></blockquote> That is a HORRIBLE REASON for a bandwagon especially since nobody responded to my request to explain the case on him and you know what? I STILL DON'T SEE A CASE WORTHY OF A LYNCH<br><br>6. Gud is one of your top suspects, you say he wasn' you very top, howevr if you look at your posts day 1, most of them are back and forth with Gud and you seem to have \"BETTER REASONS\" for a Gud vote. If you actually voted Gud I woud have been okay with it because you were actually making more sense on why he was scum than you were on Amor, but you were voting Amor and not Gud<br><br>7. I have no clue what the fuck you are talking about<br><br>8. same here, I am not sure what you are talking about.<br><br>now on to fringe mafia<br><br>yes they got me lynched but I still pegged them as scum, so yes I nailed them, that loss wasn't on me because if they listened to me they would have unvoted me and continuted to lynch the scum, but scum kept trying to make me seem like I was incompetent, sort of like you are doing now.<br><br>the fact is if the town had to follow somebody between me and you, if they chose you the town will lose, if they follow me they will lynch you and you will flip scum most likely<br><br>do I know you are scum? no i don't but based on your play this game and the fact that you are doing things that are classic scumtells you are more deserving of a lynch than Amor.<br><br>I am definitely NOT the lynch candidate because I have already proven that I can find scum and if it wasn't for TMH's horrible play we could have probably lynched weird instead."}

The fact that Gud moved onto a wagon where his suspect already was doesn't strike me as scummy at all; on the contrary it means he's going to lynch who he thinks is scum regardless of who is already there.  Gud's been playing fairly town so far, at least over the last few pages, from what I can see.

I tend to be suspicious of early game scum using subtle tactics to distance themselves from their scum buddies early without trying to explicitly call for their lynch.  I find that the second scummiest thing early is for a scum candidate to call their scum buddy scum.  That way if that person flips scum, the buddy scores major town points.  Early in the game it's hard to read anyone because the town doesn't have knowledge, while the scum do (this is an obvious point, but in case I need to state it, there it is.)  Therefore, scum are often more anxious to point out \"scum\" behavior on townies, and often fail to make logical points about people's behavior.  They instead rely on bad play or accusations on their scum buddy, since they have reason to know that that buddy is scum."}

(And, you\u2019re welcome, town <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\";)\" title=\"Wink\"> )  A fun one to make my return to site with!  This being my first time being a SK, let me say it is *hard*.   Even though I didn\u2019t earn the win, I have a feeling I may have won a spot on a few of your \u201ckill N1 when mafia\u201d lists?<br>Also, out of curiosity, link to the deadtopic?<br><br><br>Mafia:<br>I was more afraid of the mafiakill than the lynch, if that explains my play somewhat.  (Though honestly, I\u2019m not sure what I would have done differently?  Taking a look at the quicktopic, I was always skating close to your killchoice.)  I would have killed for unnightkillability, even 1-shot.  Without any immunities, I figured my best chance was to eliminate you all before (a) the doctor died or (b) you realized there wasn\u2019t one.  I was worried about how to handle Gud\u2019s post-New Years\u2019 reversal, which did buy him a night\u2019s reprieve, for what it\u2019s worth.  No net gain, though, since WR outed himself by stonewalling the Amor lynch (really, really sloppy there).  I did briefly toy with hammering SB D2 to try to diminish credibility, but decided that I was too far along to do that (especially after you killed Llama N1) and so I committed fully to making my [presumably] flipping innocent something you would fear too much to kill me.  That's why I didn't make a greater effort to lynch you earlier [believe it or not]- I figured if you thought you could survive my attention, you wouldn't disrupt the equilibrium by having me flip innocent.<br><br>Perhaps in retrospect I should have made a greater effort to lynch you earlier, which might have given me more time to deal with a town powerrole.  Or maybe letting you live D3 and trying to mislynch a townsperson was the correct play.  Though D3 I figured once RC flipped doctor, I couldn\u2019t trust you to keep up the detente longer than you had to.  I don't know.<br><br>I wonder how you do if I\u2019m vanilla instead of SK.  On one hand, you don\u2019t have those devastating nightkills, but on the other, I don\u2019t need to hold back to earn a win.<br><br><br>RC:<br>While it may be tempting to dismiss everything I said to you on account of my alignment, for the sake of your future gamemates, though\u2026 please consider?  Granted, much of what I said was for the purpose of baiting you, because I was afraid of the \u201cwhy is EmpTyger still alive?\u201d question, and you were a harmless way to generate heat since it wouldn\u2019t lead to any risk for me.  But there were a few genuine kernels in there too.<br><br>At the very least, consider that townplay consists of 2 parts:<br>1) identifying alignments<br>2) convincing the rest of the town<br>Setting aside (1), will you acknowledge that your (2) could use some improvement?<br><br>Didn't catch any breadcrumb, although wasn't really looking.  Though I do always have trouble telling doctors and mafia apart. (In both directions.  No matter how certain I felt about my killchoices N1 and N2, I always twinged I was about to hit the doctor.)  I think most assumed you were a SK after WR died.  If anything I was worried you'd be thought a protown vigilante, which (ironically) I was afraid would make you seem the obvious doctor target, making me appear vulnerable to the mafia!<br><br><br>tmh:<br>I was really hoping to frame you as SK in endgame\u2026 and then you imploded.  Mason?  Really?<br>To me, the survey wasn't the problem, rather than the timing.<br>Also, bahposts are not the place for insinuations, no matter how mild they seem.<br><br><br>IS:<br>No way are you kill-stealing Amor.  He\u2019s my bounty. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_twisted.gif\" alt=\":twisted:\" title=\"Twisted Evil\">  D3 you were pushing 2 mafia + SK until I argued otherwise.  <br>But, a pleasure to finally play a game with you!  I knew your attack on me D3 was too good to be true- at the time I was just happy to have another way to not have to answer \u201cwhy is EmpTyger still alive?\u201d.  I figured my only chance D4 was to assume another powerrole and pray that it could poke a hole into your certainty. <br><br><br>broken:<br>It\u2019s not from speedlynching.  The thrill comes from confidence, when there\u2019s no need to hesitate.  And yes, it\u2019s fun.<br>For the record, you were the blocked N3 kill, but by process of elimination: Subs I was hoping would compensate for the previous day\u2019s hesitation, an SV kill would raise too many questions, and having IS flip innocent after accusing me of being the SK was asking for trouble.<br><br><br>SV:<br>I don\u2019t really expect you to break your persona, but whose alt are you?<br><br><br>Subs:<br>Oh, you did such a good job doubting the D3 lynch, couldn\u2019t you have had the same skepticism D4?  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\">   Well done.<br><br><br>chckflip:<br>You don\u2019t deserve the loss here; WR do.  I hate making replacements readthrough the game for nothing, but I had to hit mafia and it was too suboptimal for me to target Amor or Gud.<br><br><br>WR:<br>I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s become of the hydra philosophy in the past year in my absence, but I thought it was originally a hedge against replacement: a backup player was committing to be immediately available and familiar with the game.  If instead neither player is fully committing, then hydraing just allows 2 players to take advantage of the hydra mechanic to get away with behavior they wouldn\u2019t dare to otherwise.  I understand real-life does happen, but hydraing should be a hedge against that, not an enabler.<br><br><br>Mod:<br>Mostly well run.  A few suggestions for next time:<br>1) Doublecheck your math.  The occasional error is understandable, but nearly everyday?  And you got very lucky D3.<br>2) *Please* be tolerant of reasonable V/LA!  Especially over weekends and holidays.  One thing some mods do is to consider 48 hours of weekend = only 24 hours for the purpose of night deadlines.  I understand the desire to keep the game moving, but a game shouldn\u2019t hinge on a rainout letting me unexpectedly have a few hours of access during a V/LA over what was (in the US) a holiday weekend.<br>3) And if you do use fixed night deadlines: run them to their full length.  SV was right- that kind of WIFOM doesn\u2019t belong.  (Had I known that it was still in question, I would have echoed SV\u2019s preference.)<br>Also, 5 years onsite?  Might I ask who you were?"}
