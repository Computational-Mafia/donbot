Posts 2-5 strike me as over defensive, and then his response to being over defensive strike me as odd.

You're trying to argue that it's scummy to ask questions in one's first post, instead of immediately voting.  That it's scummy to work with other players, instead of ignoring what they're arguing.  And that's not getting into all the other stuff you've made up, which I've shown in black and white are made up: about me \"forgetting things\" (I didn't) or that I \"didn't directly answer your question\" (I did).

You're looking for \"scummy middle ground\".  There it is.  Or, more likely, there's your partner.<br>\n<br>\nI mean, not even Amor is foolish enough to try to argue this illogic against me.  Granted, that's probably because Amor's trying to slink out of the limelight, doing his damnedest not to draw my further attention.

Also games I have played where I have been scum, my partners have lurked.<br>\n<br>\n7. your most significant contribution which shows nice effort finally at some attempt at scum hunting<br>\n<br>\nnow number 8<br>\n<br>\n1. you aren't putting your best scum hunting effort forward is helping town catch scum how? I'll tell you IT'S NOT<br>\n<br>\n2. about my posting, just because it may not be aparant to you right now, doesn't mean it doesn't help the town later. If one of these lurkers starts posting more and happens to make a slip OR one of these lurkers starts posting and finds something we all missed, than I have helped the town. I don't see how me encouranging the quiet people to post is hurting the town in anyway. If me encouraging the town is hurting town, please show me how it is hurting. You can accuse me of not scum hunting all you want but there are others not scum hunting too, why not go after them also?<br>\n<br>\n3. You cite your examples of scum prolonging RVS, fair enough but themanhimself posted his experience he has seen the other way around and you try and spin it by saying \"just because the 2 who did it one time were scumbuddies doesn't mean that will happen a lot.\" but it doesn't mean that it won't happen alot either. You are making an assumption based on something that can't even be verified. You can't verify that scum wants to end RVS OR prolong it, because every group of scum is different.<br>\n<br>\n4. and finally, your last part towards Amor, you want him to confirm me as scum and you will look for the other, that means you think Amor is scum number 1 SO....<br>\n<br>\nWhy the fuck are you not voting him if you think he is scum number one?

Or Scum. Actually youre probably a idiotic filthy liar scum. SB is also the largest bandwagon, which is conveniently tied with yours. As I said, I think SB is scum as well as you. SB has just been a vote monkey looking to latch on to anything thats viable while providing little content. You have just been inconsistent with your attacks and antagonizing everyone with your empty assessments. I call you out on your sillyness, so that makes me scum?</div></blockquote>\n\nThis is the second time you've accused me of lying with nothing to back it up.  I never claimed I was the largest wagon, but your voting me was (did) make me largest, and so it would have been a more effective place for your vote if you genuinely believed both SB and I were scum.  I'd also like to call attention to the last two lines, which are the kind of fact-free vitriol IS has posted throughout the game. What inconsistencies or \"empty assessments\" are you referring to?  How am I supposed to defend myself against something like that?<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Internet Stranger wrote:</cite>Part of my voting on SB is to assert myself as being serious as his scum vibes. Besides, I voted for him first before the Pinewolf discussion was over. Which by the way, that was a bandwagon SB was on.</div></blockquote>\n\nSo wait, SB is scummy for being on the bandwagon you started, whereas I'm scummy for arguing against that bandwagon?  And the fact that you abandoned the PW wagon once it actually started acquiring votes is just another instance of you throwing tons of invective at someone and then making sure you don't have your vote on them when it actually matters.<br>\n<br>\nIt's also nice to know that your main concern is how you look and not getting rid of scum.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>IS wrote:</cite>I cant lynch scum by myself. I cant force people to vote along with my suspicions. All I can do is point them out and let the mob go all townie style on them. Which is precisely what im doing with Scott. See for yourself, are you seriously trying to say that my behavior is any more scummy than his?</div></blockquote>\n\nSo, you can't lynch scum by yourself, but you are able to point to people and have \"the mob\" (clearly all town members except for Glorious Leader IS) all vote for them?  And your being only one person is exactly the point I was arguing -- that you should have been working with ET instead of off on your own wagon, if you really believe what you claim to.<br>\n<br>\nAs far as SB goes, I still think he's possible scum, and if anything the way you've gone out of your way to go \"LOOK I'M SUSPECTING THIS GUY\" makes me think you're getting some bussing in.  Still, I'd like to wait until you're confirmed as scum before I start focusing on your connections.<br>\n<br>\nThe rest of the post is more useless vitriol.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>EmpTyger wrote:</cite>The going-out-in-a-blaze-of-WIFOM gambit.

Honestly, I'm doing my best to respond to the case on me (if you can even call it such), but most of it is just vague assertions of scumminess.  ET pointed to some flimsy connection between me and Gud and that's about it, and I've addressed IS's big post above.  I've been posting content throughout the game and have tried to argue logically and not emotionally.  Granted, it took me a while to get a solid scum read on anyone due partly to getting caught up in a stupid meta argument with IS (which might have been part of his plan) and partly because I don't want to tunnel vision, but I don't see how that makes me super-scummy.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>EmpTyger wrote:</cite>Ignore Gud. Tell me more about why the people *not* voting you *should* be voting you.</div></blockquote>\n\nBecause it's the cool thing to do, I guess.  If this is about IS, I become suspicious when someone is loudly arguing that someone is scum but not voting them.  If you genuinely think I'm the scummiest person here, you should be voting me.  As I mentioned above, it doesn't seem like there's a good reason for that, but if that's your opinion then the town move would be to throw a vote down.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Shattered Viewpoint wrote:</cite>I do not at all like Amor's iso5; overall, (gasp!)

You are either Pro Town or Scum so you are not making a very good point here at all.<br>\n<br>\n2. I am not twisting anything, you said Scum prolong RVS. themanhimself said he saw 2 scum try to end rvs.  You said just because 2 scum try to end rvs early it doesn't mean that it will happen alot and i said that doesn't mean it won't happen alot.  I went on to say that your comment about it doesn't mean it will happen alot is an assumption that can't be verified one way or the other. I did not twist anything<br>\n<br>\n3. Sorry it doesn't work like that, you don't say to one person. \"hey scum please tell me this other guy is scum because I want to lynch him and I want to make sure he is scum before I do it\" which is essentially what you did. You ARE calling Amor scum and you want scum to confirm I am scum, this means you just contradicted yourself.  If you thought I am the scum, you would be asking me to confirm amor as the other scum not the other way around, get it?  this is probably your biggest slip up right here.  You think Amor is scum you should be voting him.

Which means your WIFOM about \"scum wanting to prolong RVS\" is discredited just as much as his \"I saw scum try and end rvs early\"  the only thing that rings 100% truth is my statement. \"what scum does each game differs because the scum team themselves are different, you can't say scum does this or scum does that because unless you are scum, you don't know what they are capable of doing\" and that is not WIFOM, that is undeniable truth.  You find one person that says every game they have been in scum has done the exact same thing every single time, than you have disproven my statement but that person is like the tooth fairy or santa claus, they don't exsist.<br>\n<br>\n5. This isn't arrogance, this is I am pretty sure after your attempts to twist thinsg I say and than accuse me of twisting words, plus all of the other reasons I have provided I think you are scum and your play has shown it.  if the others don't agree with me, i can't help that but my case on you is strong and I will urge people to read up on you also.", "time": "Thu Dec 23, 2010 6:04 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=15828&start=175", "forum": "53", "thread": "15828"}

Use of WIFOM when he says \"scum likes to prolong RVS\" but when themanhimself says that he has seen scum try and end it early, he just writes him off. Later he says themanhimself's expereince doesnt have an impact in this game but mentions his own experience which should not be included if we are going to exclude themanhimself's experience. <br>\n<br>\n3. he accues me of using WIFOM when I explain that scum adapts each game and the \"scum likes to end RVS\" would force scum to adapt if everyone believed that, themanhimself provided such an example to support my statement but weird just wrote it off.<br>\n<br>\n4. He asks Amor to confirm me as his other scum buddy, the ONLY WAY he would ask Amor to confirm me as his other scum buddy would be A. he thinks armor is scum B. he thinks I am sure but wants confirmation from Amor to be sure.  SO..... If Amor is his top choice for scum, why is he not voting him? Why is he voting the person he wants confirmation on?

Also, on this point, everyone needs to click on page 6 and scroll to the bottom, and read SV's post 149.  It's atrocious, given that we now know WeirdRa was in fact scum.

He relies on Lynch All Liars as a basis for argument against him, and there was a lie there.<br>\n<br>\nAlso, RC, the reason you used to vote for TMHS in 241 (he said he'd be willing to lynch you or amor) doesn't fit.  I had, previously, said I'd be willing to lynch either of two different targets (amor or TMHS) and you didn't use that as a diving board to attack me.

It has nothing to do with lying about his role, because you decided he was ironclad guilty long before that, based on your made-up \"scumtells\" that you still won't admit are bogus even though you just lynched someone for them who was innocent.<br>\n<br>\nI have my rebuttal of [435] typed up but for some reason it&#8217;s not posting with quote tags.  Going para by para:<br>\n<br>\n1) No, because what you call a case is your made-up scumtells and things out of context and illogical arguing.  Of course you&#8217;re not going to agree with a case when you refuse to look at context and refuse to subscribe to logic.  <br>\n<br>\n2) No, I explicitly did so, in [206], immediately after you asked:<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">&#8220;SV indicated a post where Amor attacked IS for how he was trying to get the game moving, without Amor doing anything himself to get the game moving, which Amor said was necessary to be doing.&#8221;</div><br>\n<br>\n3) No, WR explicitly refused to vote Amor!  How are WR and I &#8220;perfect little scum buddies&#8221; if WR say Amor was suspicious, but then refuse to vote Amor, effectively stalling out the Amor wagon and directly resulting in Amor not getting lynched?  Why would mafia conspire to *not* mislynch an innocent? <br>\n<br>\n4) No, a player who tries to stop innocents from being lynched is *protown*.  <br>\nGet this through your head.<br>\nThe town is trying to lynch *mafia*.  Not &#8220;players of whatever alignment who violate RC&#8217;s made-up standards&#8221;.<br>\n<br>\n5) No, because here&#8217;s the actual context you&#8217;ve removed and ignored:<br>\nGud in [213]: <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">&#8220;What you are implying here is that only the bandwagons you are selling are legitimate.&#8221;</div><br>\nTyger in [233]: <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">&#8220;Amor is a legitimate bandwagon because, as I explained, a majority of the players are selling it.&#8221;</div><br>\n<br>\nA <div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">majority of players</div> at the time had expressed suspicion of Amor.  If a majority of players already believe Amor is mafia, there&#8217;s no need to give further explanations.  The primary issue at that point is to get those players who are *saying* Amor is suspicious to put their money where their mouth is and *vote* Amor.  The first step?  Correcting how Gud is trying to downplay this as only coming from me when it&#8217;s actually a majority.<br>\n<br>\nAnd then look what happened.  WR had *said* Amor was suspicious, but when the time came, he refused to vote.  And the bandwagon stalled.  And you decide to mislynch an innocent.<br>\n<br>\n6) No, that&#8217;s not how logic works.  You made a baseless assumption (that Gud is my top suspect), you found that the evidence doesn&#8217;t support that (since, as I said explicitly, Amor was my top suspect), and rather than make the conclusion that your initial assumption was faulty, you decide that I must have been lying because your assumptions trump the events of the actual thread.  And you decide must be mafia because anyone who disagrees with your baseless assumptions is mafia.  The logical conclusion is that your assumptions are wrong.  Which would bring you to a conclusion which fits the events of the thread: that Amor is my top suspect.<br>\n<br>\nAnd this is this exact same thing you did with tmh.

Going para by para:<br>\n<br>\n1) No, because what you call a case is your made-up scumtells and things out of context and illogical arguing.  Of course you&#8217;re not going to agree with a case when you refuse to look at context and refuse to subscribe to logic.  <br>\n<br>\n2) No, I explicitly did so, in [206], immediately after you asked:<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">&#8220;SV indicated a post where Amor attacked IS for how he was trying to get the game moving, without Amor doing anything himself to get the game moving, which Amor said was necessary to be doing.&#8221;</div><br>\n<br>\n3) No, WR explicitly refused to vote Amor!  How are WR and I &#8220;perfect little scum buddies&#8221; if WR say Amor was suspicious, but then refuse to vote Amor, effectively stalling out the Amor wagon and directly resulting in Amor not getting lynched?  Why would mafia conspire to *not* mislynch an innocent? <br>\n<br>\n4) No, a player who tries to stop innocents from being lynched is *protown*.  <br>\nGet this through your head.<br>\nThe town is trying to lynch *mafia*.  Not &#8220;players of whatever alignment who violate RC&#8217;s made-up standards&#8221;.<br>\n<br>\n5) No, because here&#8217;s the actual context you&#8217;ve removed and ignored:<br>\nGud in [213]: <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">&#8220;What you are implying here is that only the bandwagons you are selling are legitimate.&#8221;</div><br>\nTyger in [233]: <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">&#8220;Amor is a legitimate bandwagon because, as I explained, a majority of the players are selling it.&#8221;</div><br>\n<br>\nA <div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">majority of players</div> at the time had expressed suspicion of Amor.  If a majority of players already believe Amor is mafia, there&#8217;s no need to give further explanations.  The primary issue at that point is to get those players who are *saying* Amor is suspicious to put their money where their mouth is and *vote* Amor.  The first step?  Correcting how Gud is trying to downplay this as only coming from me when it&#8217;s actually a majority.<br>\n<br>\nAnd then look what happened.  WR had *said* Amor was suspicious, but when the time came, he refused to vote.  And the bandwagon stalled.  And you decide to mislynch an innocent.<br>\n<br>\n6) No, that&#8217;s not how logic works.  You made a baseless assumption (that Gud is my top suspect), you found that the evidence doesn&#8217;t support that (since, as I said explicitly, Amor was my top suspect), and rather than make the conclusion that your initial assumption was faulty, you decide that I must have been lying because your assumptions trump the events of the actual thread.  And you decide must be mafia because anyone who disagrees with your baseless assumptions is mafia.  The logical conclusion is that your assumptions are wrong.  Which would bring you to a conclusion which fits the events of the thread: that Amor is my top suspect.<br>\n<br>\nAnd this is this exact same thing you did with tmh.  How did that work out again?<br>\n<br>\n7) I can&#8217;t even begin to untangle the illogic here.

I did not make up scum tells, TMH posted what he said was a scum tell AND I pointed out how he was guilty of doing it, maybe HE made it up, but he said it was a scum tell and he did it.  Also he asked the town's opinion for his vote, if you are town you stand by your votes and FUCK anyone else who doesn't agree with it. You stand up for your vote because it is yours, asking opinions of others seemes like he was trying to not upset the rest of the town, this is also scummy play.<br>\n<br>\n3. you realize mafia isn't always going to be on the same bandwagon right? I have seen games where mafia even tried to build a case on another mafia. There are all kinds of tricks but the fact remains that Weird was saying Amor was scummy but tried to de-rail the wagon by starting one on me. What was his motivation? I have no clue.  Also the last post in that 206 that tries to belittle my case on Weird can be thorwn out the window because <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">I WAS FUCKING RIGHT</div> and teh fact that you say you aren't going to chanse after him to me is either proof that A. you are his scum buddy or B. you aren't very good at this game.

The only people that knew is was a mislynch was the scum (and the victim). So of course they can win towncred with people like you by not joining the wagon. It keeps their reads as null since they dont have to jump into the fray and opine on anything. How much has SB said? Not much, right? Thats scum behavior. Wow Amor, you really fall for crap easily, are you seriously this gullible?</div></blockquote>\n\nOther than the gratuitous insults, these two paragraphs contradict each other.  So it's perfectly easy for the SK to find mafia, but townies (who have the same info about them) are blindly stumbling in the dark, and can only string up one of their own. Are the scum easy to find or impossible?  Competence is not a scumtell, and lynching town is not a towntell.  Of course I'm not categorically stating that no scum were off the wagon, as that's been proven false by WR's flip.  It's equally dumb to suggest (as you seem to be doing) that all scum were off of it.  Also, you're simultaneously attacking SB for focusing on lurkers instead of the prominent players and arguing that the quieter, uninvolved players are more likely to be scum.  Isn't SB taking your strategy to heart by attacking SV, who hasn't opined on much of anything in this game?<br>\n<br>\nET, if you find lurkerhunting suspicious take a look at the second paragraph here and you'll see IS basically going in that direction.  Actually, everyone should take another look at this, because it's amazing how no one else has picked up on this crap logic.<br>\n<br>\nThis kind of argument is also great for scum to advance.  Not only does it give them cover for pushing townie lynches, but it casts suspicion on the very players who have been successful in <br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Internet Stranger wrote:</cite>See Amor, I dont think youre much into the scumhunting business as youre more into the anti-IS business. The fact that you dont even care if SB is scum or not tells me everything I need to know. You didnt even mention SB once.</div></blockquote>\n\nI've mentioned plenty of people other than you, and I've mentioned SB before.  I found him suspicious earlier, but he hasn't really done much to make me maintain that suspicion, and the way you're going after him makes me suspect he's found your buddy.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>ShatteredViewpoint wrote:</cite>I would like everyone's thoughts about a ScottBro-RobCapone scumteam.</div></blockquote>\n\nI'm getting a town read from RC and a null from SB, so I don't think it's likely.

The fact that Gud moved onto a wagon where his suspect already was doesn't strike me as scummy at all; on the contrary it means he's going to lynch who he thinks is scum regardless of who is already there.  Gud's been playing fairly town so far, at least over the last few pages, from what I can see. (Didn't Iso.)<br>\n<br>\nAlso, this may be a WIFOM type argument, but I find the fact that WeirdRa listed SB in his 'helpful but not scum list' as being scummy in and of itself.  I tend to be suspicious of early game scum using subtle tactics to distance themselves from their scum buddies early without trying to explicitly call for their lynch.  I find that the second scummiest thing early is for a scum candidate to call their scum buddy scum.  That way if that person flips scum, the buddy scores major town points.  Early in the game it's hard to read anyone because the town doesn't have knowledge, while the scum do (this is an obvious point, but in case I need to state it, there it is.)  Therefore, scum are often more anxious to point out \"scum\" behavior on townies, and often fail to make logical points about people's behavior.  They instead rely on bad play or accusations on their scum buddy, since they have reason to know that that buddy is scum.", "time": "Thu Jan 13, 2011 11:54 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=15828&start=550", "forum": "53", "thread": "15828"}

(And, you&#8217;re welcome, town <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\";)\" title=\"Wink\"> )  A fun one to make my return to site with!  This being my first time being a SK, let me say it is *hard*.   Even though I didn&#8217;t earn the win, I have a feeling I may have won a spot on a few of your &#8220;kill N1 when mafia&#8221; lists?<br>\nAlso, out of curiosity, link to the deadtopic?<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nMafia:<br>\nI was more afraid of the mafiakill than the lynch, if that explains my play somewhat.  (Though honestly, I&#8217;m not sure what I would have done differently?  Taking a look at the quicktopic, I was always skating close to your killchoice.)  I would have killed for unnightkillability, even 1-shot.  Without any immunities, I figured my best chance was to eliminate you all before (a) the doctor died or (b) you realized there wasn&#8217;t one.  I was worried about how to handle Gud&#8217;s post-New Years&#8217; reversal, which did buy him a night&#8217;s reprieve, for what it&#8217;s worth.  No net gain, though, since WR outed himself by stonewalling the Amor lynch (really, really sloppy there).  I did briefly toy with hammering SB D2 to try to diminish credibility, but decided that I was too far along to do that (especially after you killed Llama N1) and so I committed fully to making my [presumably] flipping innocent something you would fear too much to kill me.  That's why I didn't make a greater effort to lynch you earlier [believe it or not]- I figured if you thought you could survive my attention, you wouldn't disrupt the equilibrium by having me flip innocent.<br>\n<br>\nPerhaps in retrospect I should have made a greater effort to lynch you earlier, which might have given me more time to deal with a town powerrole.  Or maybe letting you live D3 and trying to mislynch a townsperson was the correct play.  Though D3 I figured once RC flipped doctor, I couldn&#8217;t trust you to keep up the detente longer than you had to.  I don't know.<br>\n<br>\nI wonder how you do if I&#8217;m vanilla instead of SK.  On one hand, you don&#8217;t have those devastating nightkills, but on the other, I don&#8217;t need to hold back to earn a win.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nRC:<br>\nWhile it may be tempting to dismiss everything I said to you on account of my alignment, for the sake of your future gamemates, though&#8230; please consider?  Granted, much of what I said was for the purpose of baiting you, because I was afraid of the &#8220;why is EmpTyger still alive?&#8221; question, and you were a harmless way to generate heat since it wouldn&#8217;t lead to any risk for me.  But there were a few genuine kernels in there too.<br>\n<br>\nAt the very least, consider that townplay consists of 2 parts:<br>\n1) identifying alignments<br>\n2) convincing the rest of the town<br>\nSetting aside (1), will you acknowledge that your (2) could use some improvement?<br>\n<br>\nDidn't catch any breadcrumb, although wasn't really looking.  Though I do always have trouble telling doctors and mafia apart. (In both directions.  No matter how certain I felt about my killchoices N1 and N2, I always twinged I was about to hit the doctor.)  I think most assumed you were a SK after WR died.  If anything I was worried you'd be thought a protown vigilante, which (ironically) I was afraid would make you seem the obvious doctor target, making me appear vulnerable to the mafia!<br>\n<br>\n<br>\ntmh:<br>\nI was really hoping to frame you as SK in endgame&#8230; and then you imploded.  Mason?  Really?<br>\nTo me, the survey wasn't the problem, rather than the timing.<br>\nAlso, bahposts are not the place for insinuations, no matter how mild they seem.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nIS:<br>\nNo way are you kill-stealing Amor.  He&#8217;s my bounty. <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_twisted.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":twisted:\" title=\"Twisted Evil\">  D3 you were pushing 2 mafia + SK until I argued otherwise.  <br>\nBut, a pleasure to finally play a game with you!  I knew your attack on me D3 was too good to be true- at the time I was just happy to have another way to not have to answer &#8220;why is EmpTyger still alive?&#8221;.  I figured my only chance D4 was to assume another powerrole and pray that it could poke a hole into your certainty. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\nbroken:<br>\nIt&#8217;s not from speedlynching.  The thrill comes from confidence, when there&#8217;s no need to hesitate.  And yes, it&#8217;s fun.<br>\nFor the record, you were the blocked N3 kill, but by process of elimination: Subs I was hoping would compensate for the previous day&#8217;s hesitation, an SV kill would raise too many questions, and having IS flip innocent after accusing me of being the SK was asking for trouble.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nSV:<br>\nI don&#8217;t really expect you to break your persona, but whose alt are you?<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nSubs:<br>\nOh, you did such a good job doubting the D3 lynch, couldn&#8217;t you have had the same skepticism D4?  <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\">   Well done.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nchckflip:<br>\nYou don&#8217;t deserve the loss here; WR do.  I hate making replacements readthrough the game for nothing, but I had to hit mafia and it was too suboptimal for me to target Amor or Gud.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nWR:<br>\nI&#8217;m not sure what&#8217;s become of the hydra philosophy in the past year in my absence, but I thought it was originally a hedge against replacement: a backup player was committing to be immediately available and familiar with the game.  If instead neither player is fully committing, then hydraing just allows 2 players to take advantage of the hydra mechanic to get away with behavior they wouldn&#8217;t dare to otherwise.  I understand real-life does happen, but hydraing should be a hedge against that, not an enabler.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nMod:<br>\nMostly well run.  A few suggestions for next time:<br>\n1) Doublecheck your math.  The occasional error is understandable, but nearly everyday?  And you got very lucky D3.<br>\n2) *Please* be tolerant of reasonable V/LA!  Especially over weekends and holidays.  One thing some mods do is to consider 48 hours of weekend = only 24 hours for the purpose of night deadlines.  I understand the desire to keep the game moving, but a game shouldn&#8217;t hinge on a rainout letting me unexpectedly have a few hours of access during a V/LA over what was (in the US) a holiday weekend.<br>\n3) And if you do use fixed night deadlines: run them to their full length.  SV was right- that kind of WIFOM doesn&#8217;t belong.  (Had I known that it was still in question, I would have echoed SV&#8217;s preference.)<br>\nAlso, 5 years onsite?

I knew that once Amor died, the nature of the game would change, and so was putting that off as long as I could.  Problem was, once a doctor died, that also changed the nature of the game!  It was a sprint, and I was a phase behind.  I didn't see Gud or Amor letting me live into an endgame with either of them.<br>\n<br>\n(Also, I'll admit, I don't think I had the stamina D3 to pull it off a mislynch.  I was miserably sick, and didn't have the energy to create an attack on someone new out of nowhere, and you came out so strong that I didn't think you'd allow me time to sufficiently recover.  I was hoping I could just coast on Amor to get through D3, and save mislynching you or maybe SV for D4 when I was healthier.
