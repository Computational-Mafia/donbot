As I've said Ive got a reasonable townread on Maria so I'd like to know what he sees as scummy in her. 171, 231 and 232 seem to be him complaining about how it's difficult to read people this early on, and whilst I understand that sentiment he must of picked up on something worth commenting on further than 'that could've come from scum Maria'. He's asked a couple of okay questions after that but overall, a weak scumread, but would need to see more to solidify that.", "time": "Mon Sep 19, 2016 8:53 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=68380&start=275", "forum": "53", "thread": "68380"}

Mostly this is due to her actions regarding gamma. Gamma isn't a vote target that makes much sense for scum-ecane. Gamma isn't a player that's been high on people's radars either way, but he's been here and not a pushover. Seems like an odd fight to pick for scum early in the game.<br>\n<br>\nSpeaking of gamma, he's seemed a bit opportunistic and has seemingly been around the scum-flavor of the day a lot. It's not enough for me to scum read him - both psyche and yoshi were perfectly acceptable votes for him - but its something to remember for later. Other than that, nothing is really swinging me either way.<br>\n<br>\nI think I already expressed a growing townread on gear, but if I didn't, its there. I've liked his approach so far, even if we disagree on things. Looks like someone trying to figure things out as opposed to pushing a mislynch or avoiding pressure.<br>\n<br>\nJake looks like town.

It's because it isn't all that wrong. Some of the conflict is because I think more attention should be put upon those who aren't contributing and overall some actions I did appear to him as scummy. I still feel strong for 1. Number 2 was saying that this was a small encounter for such a huge response, which seemed scummy to me. I don't think his response to 3 was one that grilled me. Sure, I admit I should have asked for why he townread Maria, it would have been a logical thing to do there, but I didn't really because I don't care. I'd like some explanation on 4, and why he thinks 154 is scummy. He's got me on number 5 though. He's right, but like him I didn't feel like he was gonna respond so I looked into getting votes on him instead. Number 6 is just a matter of opinion.
