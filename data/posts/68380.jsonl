His later explination in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8343340#p8343340\">231</a> shows no indication why he thought my town read in particular was worth commenting on. It wasn't a particularly strong read, and its not until <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8345767#p8345767\">281</a> that yoshi can come up with a reason why my slight-townread on maria was worth singling out, which is an explination that contradicts <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8343340#p8343340\">231</a>. First it was because he didn't like early reads at all, but then it's because Maria's a good player.<br><br>It feels more like yoshi wanted to comment on Maria (who was the topic at hand) but wanted to avoid much fanfare.<br><br>Now look at yoshi's play since then. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8340807#p8340807\">173</a> simple reaffirms <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8339691#p8339691\">154</a> without further explination. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8340814#p8340814\">174</a> is worthless and pretty blatantly anti-discussion. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8343340#p8343340\">231</a> is completely conciliatory to me after I started pushing him further. Note here that <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8340807#p8340807\">173</a> is similarly backing away from confrontation with Maria.<br><br>In general, it feels like yoshi was trying to avoid making waves. That's why he basically conceded everything to me in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8343340#p8343340\">231</a> when I initially voted for him, and it's why he spent a good amount of time focusing on psyche recently.<br><br>But let's look at how yoshi approached the whole psyche-thing. He says psyche is 'shitposting-town\" in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8343393#p8343393\">234</a>, asks like 4 different people about psyche, votes for him, but never once asks psyche any questions directly. All in all, it looks like he's trying to draw attention to psyche's lack of content - which is obvious - but he's not trying to do anything about it. And then <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8346441#p8346441\">295</a>. I can understand trying to keep your reads close to your vest (although I don't endorse it) but the way he does it is scummy. It looks to me like he want to follow someone else's reads and logic.<br><br>All in all, yoshi looks like someone who's trying to avoid making waves. He concedes basically everything to someone else.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8347546#p8347546\" class=\"postlink\">post 307</a>, Jake from State Farm wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8343109#p8343109\" class=\"postlink\">post 226</a>, Jaack wrote:</cite>you actually never said gerry was a good scum candidate and your reasons for yoshi loop like you are reaching for something.

Mostly this is due to her actions regarding gamma. Gamma isn't a vote target that makes much sense for scum-ecane. Gamma isn't a player that's been high on people's radars either way, but he's been here and not a pushover. Seems like an odd fight to pick for scum early in the game.<br><br>Speaking of gamma, he's seemed a bit opportunistic and has seemingly been around the scum-flavor of the day a lot. It's not enough for me to scum read him - both psyche and yoshi were perfectly acceptable votes for him - but its something to remember for later. Other than that, nothing is really swinging me either way.<br><br>I think I already expressed a growing townread on gear, but if I didn't, its there. I've liked his approach so far, even if we disagree on things. Looks like someone trying to figure things out as opposed to pushing a mislynch or avoiding pressure.<br><br>Jake looks like town. He's come to a lot of the same conclusions as me about yoshi, and I like <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8350294#p8350294\">378</a> in particular.<br><br>I have literally no opinion on light ganski.

I'd like some explanation on 4, and why he thinks 154 is scummy. He's got me on number 5 though.

Sure, I admit I should have asked for why he townread Maria, it would have been a logical thing to do there, but I didn't really because I don't care. I'd like some explanation on 4, and why he thinks 154 is scummy. He's got me on number 5 though. He's right, but like him I didn't feel like he was gonna respond so I looked into getting votes on him instead. Number 6 is just a matter of opinion.

It's because it isn't all that wrong. Some of the conflict is because I think more attention should be put upon those who aren't contributing and overall some actions I did appear to him as scummy. I still feel strong for 1. Number 2 was saying that this was a small encounter for such a huge response, which seemed scummy to me. I don't think his response to 3 was one that grilled me. Sure, I admit I should have asked for why he townread Maria, it would have been a logical thing to do there, but I didn't really because I don't care. I'd like some explanation on 4, and why he thinks 154 is scummy. He's got me on number 5 though. He's right, but like him I didn't feel like he was gonna respond so I looked into getting votes on him instead. Number 6 is just a matter of opinion. Personally, I think non-contributing players should be given more attention. Now 7, I dunno...
