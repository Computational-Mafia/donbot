He then went and asked if others would do so. That makes me feel slightly that that's a Town thing to do.

I have a slight Town read on him.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Naomi-Tan ~  0.</span> I love the name Naomi. It's cute. Anyways, she random'd in (8) for theaceofspades. She refused to answer this 1st part of archaebob's question in (37), because \"I think this question could be used by scum to work out who is weaker and better alive late game, so im not gonna answer it.\" I have mixed feelings on this, but my gut tells me this sentiment is more right than wrong. Curiously, in (59) Naomi asked \"wait... why is he being paranoid?,\" which doesn't make sense because I never explicitly said Nic was being paranoid, but that in general activity is good for Town and paranoia isn't. A good many VTs and PRs have been hung due to paranoid Townies. Her feathers are a bit ruffled due to my abrasive (yet effective) nature (88). I'm only abrasive in Mafia. Catch \"Wake\" on usmessageboards.com and you'll find me to be quite the gentleman. I'm getting a null read on her.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">archaebob ~  +2.</span> RV'd in (13).

Initially questioned how the RQS helped, and says \"It maybe a conversation starter in early game but surely nothing that will help us with scum hunting.\" I'm unsure what to think of it at that point. However, he then asks Squilly why he voted for jackofspades in (23). Slight Town read there. He later answers his question in full in (26). That nullifies the earlier feeling of uncertainty; slight Town read. He then obliges jack's question of what to do while hunting, which is, as well, helpful. He also implies/asks Nic in (33) and (38) on how Nic hadn't voted for someone but was wanting a wagon to ensue (If I've got this wrong, aptil, please let me know). In (83) he questions Antihero on his hapless vote for me. (86): \"I thought getting reactions out of people was a good thing.\" He is right, and Antihero is not. He has 16 posts thus far, and has contributed a bit. So, I have a Town read on him.<br> <br><span class=\"noboldsig\">NicCage and SalmonellaDreams ~ 0.</span> I'm not on good terms with Nic at this point, so I'm not sure I can give a fair reading on them.

He doesn't really explain his vote, but, like people do when they haven't read things through, he makes a rather dumb comment about me. Apparently he's ignorant. He later unvotes in (99), which is after I've started typing up this post. He felt so certain earlier, yet he then turned on a dime. I'd like to hear him explain himself. I've got a slight Scum read on him right now, but if he explains himself and otherwise tries to be helpful and willing to listen, my impression of him will likely change.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Radiant Cowbells ~ 0.</span> She hasn't posted yet.

He then went and asked if others would do so. That makes me feel slightly that that's a Town thing to do.

I have a slight Town read on him.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Naomi-Tan ~  0.</span> I love the name Naomi. It's cute. Anyways, she random'd in (8) for theaceofspades. She refused to answer this 1st part of archaebob's question in (37), because \"I think this question could be used by scum to work out who is weaker and better alive late game, so im not gonna answer it.\" I have mixed feelings on this, but my gut tells me this sentiment is more right than wrong. Curiously, in (59) Naomi asked \"wait... why is he being paranoid?,\" which doesn't make sense because I never explicitly said Nic was being paranoid, but that in general activity is good for Town and paranoia isn't. A good many VTs and PRs have been hung due to paranoid Townies. Her feathers are a bit ruffled due to my abrasive (yet effective) nature (88). I'm only abrasive in Mafia. Catch \"Wake\" on usmessageboards.com and you'll find me to be quite the gentleman. I'm getting a null read on her.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">archaebob ~  +2.</span> RV'd in (13).

Initially questioned how the RQS helped, and says \"It maybe a conversation starter in early game but surely nothing that will help us with scum hunting.\" I'm unsure what to think of it at that point. However, he then asks Squilly why he voted for jackofspades in (23). Slight Town read there. He later answers his question in full in (26). That nullifies the earlier feeling of uncertainty; slight Town read. He then obliges jack's question of what to do while hunting, which is, as well, helpful. He also implies/asks Nic in (33) and (38) on how Nic hadn't voted for someone but was wanting a wagon to ensue (If I've got this wrong, aptil, please let me know). In (83) he questions Antihero on his hapless vote for me. (86): \"I thought getting reactions out of people was a good thing.\" He is right, and Antihero is not. He has 16 posts thus far, and has contributed a bit. So, I have a Town read on him.<br> <br><span class=\"noboldsig\">NicCage and SalmonellaDreams ~ 0.</span> I'm not on good terms with Nic at this point, so I'm not sure I can give a fair reading on them.

He doesn't really explain his vote, but, like people do when they haven't read things through, he makes a rather dumb comment about me. Apparently he's ignorant. He later unvotes in (99), which is after I've started typing up this post. He felt so certain earlier, yet he then turned on a dime. I'd like to hear him explain himself. I've got a slight Scum read on him right now, but if he explains himself and otherwise tries to be helpful and willing to listen, my impression of him will likely change.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Radiant Cowbells ~ 0.</span> She hasn't posted yet.

I know that a lot of the time people are giving one or two sentence responses to things that have just been posted, but none of that carries over in iso if you don't quote.  I don't mean to encumber anyone; it's just borne very true in my experience that when a thread is easily researched the town keeps better track of the game narrative and enjoys the game more.

Ooh yeah, you're the man.  After all, if you just commit completely enough we're bound to realize that we're all \"village idiots\" and that you really are Anu and Enlil's gift to mafia.  Go ahead, write that snarky, dismissive response to this post.  I'm excited to see what new insults you can come up with, and I'll miss you after your lynch.  <br><br>2) You can recognize that some of the things you are being asked to do are not insane, and that it is in fact <span style=\"font-style: italic\">your</span> pride that has lead to the dialogue deteriorating this far.  Nobody in this town knows your alignment; it is <span style=\"font-style: italic\">you</span> who are being rude if you refuse to answer simple questions for no clear reason, and <span style=\"font-style: italic\">you</span> who has his head up his ass (\"God's special little snowflake\") if you get indignant when people fail to prostrate themselves before you while demanding answers.  You can take a step back, make a face-saving post, and then start playing like someone who is actually more interested in winning the game for the town than in having their ego stroked.  I strongly recommend this option.<br><br>Here, I have <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dexIA_OfLzg\" class=\"postlink\">something which will help</a>.  It is a gorgeous and humorous video about the virtue of humility.  Watch it, rethink your life some, and then show us what you're really made of."}

Says I'm talking for the sake of talking, and that I haven't done much either, which in itself is retarded because I've put my ass out on a line to Scum hunt here. He then says that if my postings aren't a ploy then maybe I really am full of myself. And, to aim my investigative barrel a bit more directly at Nic's behavior... ...he then quips about me being banned elsewhere, yet he has no clue about any of that besides what I said. It sorts of reminds me of an apt Scum trying to slowly \"stab\" a his lynch target to get him banned, but is clever enough to say he can always lynch his target later to give himself more leeway.

Basically he's there to be an impediment no matter what you do or say. He may be more likely stupid, raging Townie.

I don't think I can prove that Town Tracker is a common PR in 13-player games <span style=\"font-style: italic\">here</span>. <br><br>I've simply role-claimed as Town Tracker and I'll let the chips fall where they may. I suppose I could try to prove it, of course, by tracking someone. If that person I've tracked has done nothing, and I ask my target if they did anything and they confirm that they didn't, that'd add some weight proving that I am indeed the Town Tracker."}

But his actions after his hard claim are unimpressive. He refuses to answer questions. He directs night actions day 1 based on setup speculation. He harasses players with petulant posts. Wake will soon realize that he could easily be lynched Day 1 if he continues anti-town behavior. Whatever his allegiance, maybe he will be more cooperative at that time."}

You disagree with me on a point of mafia theory regarding how and why people should direct their votes.  I believe that focused bandwagons are helpful to the town, and am willing to make small compromises among my top suspects to encourage that environment.  Nic is a player I'd like to know more about.

No one seems to give a shit when they get voted, and no one seems to give a shit when they don't give a shit.  Many of the accusations flying around, albeit most are at Wake, seem to center around doing things without a reason.  At the risk of sounding like an IC of some newbie game, can we all try to post our reasoning a little more clearly?  Some of you are, and some of you aren't.  Please don't waste mooore time informing me that you have in fact been posting diligently as I'm sure Wake will anyway. <br><br>When I was reading the thread I immediately had my mind made up to vote Ace.  I saw his post in which he suggested he just might be able to morally stomach lynching Wake for being so anti-town, and he might be scum anyway, right?  My stomach actually turned at that one, it's kind of an exciting feeling when you think you've just cracked the code.  Then archaebob voted him, and I thought \"oh you, archaebob. Well done.\"  Then lo and behold archaebob's reasoning is the same as mine.  This was both exciting and disappointing.  It means my suspicions of ace are not unfounded, but it also means the trail has run dry (for the moment).  It was a very scummy thing to say, but a line of inquiry would end fairly quickly, especially in this town.  Plus, Albert had the good sense to say:<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I'm able to follow his line of thinking so far; it makes sense. <span style=\"font-style: italic\">Scum usually don't change their minds as easily as town in my experience.</span></div></blockquote> <br><br>So I'm sure we'll see scum changing their minds all over the place and being happy to do it.  <br><br>Also, @Albert:  I apologize on behalf of Radiant Cowbell <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\";)\" title=\"Wink\"><br><br>So!  I will return to Ace in the not too distant future.  I commit to that, I float my read out there, etc. etc.  I'd like you all to do the same as much as possible.  <br><br>@Ace:  Before I actually vote you, I've noticed the vast majority of your posts are simply reactions to Wake's resemblance to an anal cavity.  You've gotten away with this because he is overpowering all discussions with hints about how great he is (I'm really stretching the meaning of the word hint).  I would very much like it of you would post clear reads of at least two of three players who you find scummiest, with reasons why, etc.  <br><br>@All, but especially Wake:  The reason I'm not voting Ace yet is because I think there is a better place for my vote in the immediate future.  See, I actually read archaebob's article on environments and I found a great deal to agree with (for those of you who don't know what I'm talking about, it's in one of his posts directed at Wake when Wake starts accusing him).  As I said earlier, a line of inquiry for Ace is relatively fruitless until he posts more, though I'm far from opposed to a pressure wagon on him if such a thing materializes.  <br><br>@Wake:  Your play style is bad for town.  I spent 90% of my read being annoyed and frustrated with you.  You have created an environment in which it is easy for scum to hide.  They can all just get upset with you and spend pages and pages calling you anti-town, pressuring you to be nicer and to post more content, and never feel obligated to talk about anyone else.  Town are going to do that too, because you really are a huge asshole.  Your playstyle has not resulted in a suspicion I find remotely useful.  You attacked archaebob for the most inane reasons and use your asshole personality as a fallback to avoid having to explain yourself.  You've used your asshole personality to avoid answering Albert's questions as well, even after being asked directly several times.  You had all your softclaiming shit, and then hard claim of Town Tracker.  This is more anti-town behavior that scum players can latch onto and have a nice warm place to ride through day 1 in.  You need to stop.  You need to answer questions directed at you.  <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: NicCage</span><br><br>Nic, you were great at the beginning in trying to generate discussion, then you fell into the Wake trap, then you kind of flailed blindly to get out of the Wake trap, and since then you haven't done anything very useful, including (until very recently) give a serious response to accusations of you.  There is little to add to archaebob's post responding to yours, though I would like you to feel under great pressure to respond adequately."}

The majority among us don't have any stake in ignoring or twisting your comments; we just have limited energy, and you chosen to play in a way that does not reward us for interacting with you.  I know you think you've been posting \"real content\" in the past several pages, but you have a lot to learn about how town opinion works.  You cannot separate good argumentation from your personal credibility and treat them as different things.  This is not arbitrary; it's a fact of mafia and of life, and there's good reasons for it.  If you want to turn over a new leaf and start playing in an effective and moderated fashion, I don't think you'll find that people preemptively disqualify your points simply because they are coming from you.  <br><br>Do you actually suspect Nic at all?  You had your vote on him before.  Well, right now the attention is on him.  You'll note that we've been making cases, and that he's been responding.  Feel free to contribute, or to argue for why we should focus our attention elsewhere.  Otherwise I wouldn't expect much by way of sympathy from the town."}

It's like ordering a fresh sandwich and watching it quickly rot in your hands. I have no reason to put in any more of my time and effort into this game when we have about 4 players who haven't even posted ten times.

Each post is a snapshot of what I think at that moment. There are no posts about suspecting aptil, i considered aptil scummy for a bit, but I changed my mind before I posted again. It's not necessary to write out all the thoughts I have since disregarded. same principle here. This isn't my diary. <br>Maybe that's what you'd do, but I feel it puts more pressure on someone to tell them you have definite expectations, especially if they don't know what they are, as it happens he'd already claimed, so it was moot. but the point is, be telling him he had two \"bad\" answers, wouldn't have made it easier for him to avoid them then if I'd kept my mouth shut, perhaps he wouldn't have claimed at all, but that seems unlikely.  Instead, it would place more pressure on him, and make him more likely to slip as scum, as town he would have no pressure, because he would tell the truth either way.

Curiously, in (59) Naomi asked \"wait... why is he being paranoid?,\" which doesn't make sense because I never explicitly said Nic was being paranoid, but that in general activity is good for Town and paranoia isn't. A good many VTs and PRs have been hung due to paranoid Townies. Her feathers are a bit ruffled due to my abrasive (yet effective) nature (88). I'm only abrasive in Mafia.

However, he then asks Squilly why he voted for jackofspades in (23). Slight Town read there. He later answers his question in full in (26). That nullifies the earlier feeling of uncertainty; slight Town read. He then obliges jack's question of what to do while hunting, which is, as well, helpful. He also implies/asks Nic in (33) and (38) on how Nic hadn't voted for someone but was wanting a wagon to ensue (If I've got this wrong, aptil, please let me know). In (83) he questions Antihero on his hapless vote for me. (86): \"I thought getting reactions out of people was a good thing.\" He is right, and Antihero is not.

No one seems to give a shit when they get voted, and no one seems to give a shit when they don't give a shit.  Many of the accusations flying around, albeit most are at Wake, seem to center around doing things without a reason.  At the risk of sounding like an IC of some newbie game, can we all try to post our reasoning a little more clearly?  Some of you are, and some of you aren't.  Please don't waste mooore time informing me that you have in fact been posting diligently as I'm sure Wake will anyway. <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">When I was reading the thread I immediately had my mind made up to vote Ace.  I saw his post in which he suggested he just might be able to morally stomach lynching Wake for being so anti-town, and he might be scum anyway, right?  My stomach actually turned at that one, it's kind of an exciting feeling when you think you've just cracked the code.  Then archaebob voted him, and I thought \"oh you, archaebob. Well done.\"  Then lo and behold archaebob's reasoning is the same as mine.  This was both exciting and disappointing.  It means my suspicions of ace are not unfounded, but it also means the trail has run dry (for the moment).  It was a very scummy thing to say, but a line of inquiry would end fairly quickly, especially in this town.  Plus, Albert had the good sense to say:</span><br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I'm able to follow his line of thinking so far; it makes sense. <span style=\"font-style: italic\">Scum usually don't change their minds as easily as town in my experience.</span></div></blockquote> <br><br>So I'm sure we'll see scum changing their minds all over the place and being happy to do it.  <br><br>Also, @Albert:  I apologize on behalf of Radiant Cowbell <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\";)\" title=\"Wink\"><br><br>So!  I will return to Ace in the not too distant future.  I commit to that, I float my read out there, etc. etc.  I'd like you all to do the same as much as possible.  <br><br>@Ace:  Before I actually vote you, I've noticed the vast majority of your posts are simply reactions to Wake's resemblance to an anal cavity.  You've gotten away with this because he is overpowering all discussions with hints about how great he is (I'm really stretching the meaning of the word hint).  I would very much like it of you would post clear reads of at least two of three players who you find scummiest, with reasons why, etc.  <br><br>@All, but especially Wake:  The reason I'm not voting Ace yet is because I think there is a better place for my vote in the immediate future.  See, I actually read archaebob's article on environments and I found a great deal to agree with (for those of you who don't know what I'm talking about, it's in one of his posts directed at Wake when Wake starts accusing him).  As I said earlier, a line of inquiry for Ace is relatively fruitless until he posts more, though I'm far from opposed to a pressure wagon on him if such a thing materializes.  <br><br>@Wake:  Your play style is bad for town.  I spent 90% of my read being annoyed and frustrated with you.  You have created an environment in which it is easy for scum to hide.  They can all just get upset with you and spend pages and pages calling you anti-town, pressuring you to be nicer and to post more content, and never feel obligated to talk about anyone else.  Town are going to do that too, because you really are a huge asshole.  Your playstyle has not resulted in a suspicion I find remotely useful.  You attacked archaebob for the most inane reasons and use your asshole personality as a fallback to avoid having to explain yourself.  You've used your asshole personality to avoid answering Albert's questions as well, even after being asked directly several times.  You had all your softclaiming shit, and then hard claim of Town Tracker.  This is more anti-town behavior that scum players can latch onto and have a nice warm place to ride through day 1 in.  You need to stop.  You need to answer questions directed at you.  <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: NicCage</span><br><br>Nic, you were great at the beginning in trying to generate discussion, then you fell into the Wake trap, then you kind of flailed blindly to get out of the Wake trap, and since then you haven't done anything very useful, including (until very recently) give a serious response to accusations of you.

You are wrong, though I brought this on myself.  I obviously can't speak for me predecessor, so whatever the fuck he was thinking is what he was thinking.  As far as what I was thinking, I expressed it quite clearly in my post that you quoted (as far as my immediate suspicions).  Now there are three parts to that post, and you can decide whether or not you believe me.  First and foremost, the bolded part of the quotation was an, albeit stylized, exact description of my actual reaction.  I read Ace's post and my chest \"literally\" fell.  From that moment on I have believed him to be scum.  <br><br>Part 2, which is actually the most important, as I think it will explain where you think my scum motivation is coming from, was to fuck with archaebob.  Archaebob is aggressively pro-town, is calm and collected, and directs the town in ways that are hardly questionable in their validity.  Scumhunting such a person is extremely difficult, so I did several things to test out how he would react.  I joined his NicCage wagon and cited his article (which was actually pretty good) to see how he would warm up to buddying.  Then he asked me about my origins in mafia directly, so I decided to not give him a straight answer and force him to chase me.  I wanted to see how far his pro-town thing would go, and if he really kept it up I wanted to get a feel for how genuine it was or if I thought it was an act.  Then I unvoted NicCage right after archaebob unvoted him to see if archaebob would vote NicCage again.  He didn't, and while I'm less convinced of his towniness than some others have said or implied, I don't have anywhere further to go with that line of inquiry, at least not yet.  <br><br>Third I just got off a House of Cards kick and I wanted to show up all badass sounding like Francis Underwood, so that act screwed me.   <br><br>Now as to my suspicions, I am voting ace, and will continue to vote ace for the immediate future.  I made a no secret of my suspicion for him.  So, Mrs. Lady, you would have to accept that I immediately sheeped a wagon on my scum partner in order to either bus them out or distance myself from them.  If the timing of all this sits well with you as something a scum team would do, then by all means continue to vote me.  <br><br>Now I'm done defending myself.  <br><br>There will be another post to follow shortly, though I need to do a little more rereading first.<br><br>BUT, welcome to the game.  You guys are fun  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\">"}

Alternatively, if you try and scum read them for doing exactly that, they can claim you have cognitive dissonance and likely get away scot free. <br><br>2) When you explain town reads, you are encouraging discussion about them. This kind of discussion leads to the ability for scum to provide free content. (For example, if I explained my town read on aptil, it would give the scum the potential to discuss my read/case without opening themselves up.)<br> <br>3) If you discuss your town read on someone, it lowers your ability to push them for reactions later in the game. No read is ever 100% guaranteed correct."}

You accuse him of agreeing with others, and I assume you're saying this is scummy by the way you phrase it, but RC seems to be agreeing with me and I don't find it scummy. Others may be agreeing as well without it being scummy. So I understand that you're being original with your Antihero accusation, pulling the town down a different street, but I'm not sure if you're doing this as a TACTIC or you are genuine because it's impossible to tell without you going deeper into thought processes. I'd almost give you a chance if you wrote an original analysis. A stray vote and throwaway explanations are no longer sufficient at this stage of the day, for me anyway. That's why I'm voting for you."}

I've asked you for something fairly straightforward: explain how your ideal Day 1 would transpire.  What characterizes intelligent town play at the start of the game when we have no information?  You make very strong claims about the stupidity of everyone else's approach, yet I am still awaiting a semi-articulate thought from you regarding this important question of mafia theory.  Do you actually have any insights to share, or is it all bluster and pomp with you?  Reading your posts, I don't see a calm, collected, intelligent individual who is dishing out badly needed lessons to the throng.  I see a cocky 14 - 19 year old who fancies himself a budding young intellectual in the making, but who as a result of some severe, latent personal insecurity, feels the need to roleplay online as a cocksure, dominant, take-no-shit type, except you have neither the writing chops nor the critical awareness to pull it off, so instead you spam schoolyard cliches (\"don't piss in my wheaties and call it milk.\"  ooh.  you really told him) in a flailing attempt to establish your psychical superiority over those who have asked you reasonable questions and are quickly growing bored of your antics.  I hate it to break it to you, but we are not impressed with your affected self-assurance, and you have not actually done anything to demonstrate your maturity or your intelligence.  Your posts are weak, your contribution is non-existent, and your schtick is transparent as air. <br><br>From where I'm sitting, it looks like you have two options.<br><br>1) You can try to call my bluff and push the pedal to the floor.  Ooh yeah, you're the man.  After all, if you just commit completely enough we're bound to realize that we're all \"village idiots\" and that you really are Anu and Enlil's gift to mafia.  Go ahead, write that snarky, dismissive response to this post.  I'm excited to see what new insults you can come up with, and I'll miss you after your lynch.  <br><br>2) You can recognize that some of the things you are being asked to do are not insane, and that it is in fact <span style=\"font-style: italic\">your</span> pride that has lead to the dialogue deteriorating this far.  Nobody in this town knows your alignment; it is <span style=\"font-style: italic\">you</span> who are being rude if you refuse to answer simple questions for no clear reason, and <span style=\"font-style: italic\">you</span> who has his head up his ass (\"God's special little snowflake\") if you get indignant when people fail to prostrate themselves before you while demanding answers.  You can take a step back, make a face-saving post, and then start playing like someone who is actually more interested in winning the game for the town than in having their ego stroked.  I strongly recommend this option.<br><br>Here, I have <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dexIA_OfLzg\" class=\"postlink\">something which will help</a>.  It is a gorgeous and humorous video about the virtue of humility.  Watch it, rethink your life some, and then show us what you're really made of.</div></blockquote><br><br><br>This post I find interesting. Does anyone else feel like this in fact describes archaebob's life recently, or within a coupons years ago?  What are you, 22? 23? You've painted a very believable picture, either making you enormously honest in this one post or a brilliant method actor. Even if this post is a reflection of the former, I would say it reveals a lot of introspection and intelligence. Now, how would this person go about playing scum? He has gone so far as to write articles on pro-town behavior, so scum archaebob is already committed to high levels of activity and reason, more so than is town archaebob. <br><br>So here is my key question to the town. Does it feel to anyone else like this whole game is some kind of theory experiment? 90% of his posting is dedicated to explaining pro-town behavior or appealing to our sense of it. For someone legitimately trying to catch scum in the near future he is extremely wrapped up in having nice orderly, pro-town wagons moving wherever they ought to go. <br><br>@archaebob: You're certainly a brilliant actor, but I still feel like I'm watching a performance. <br><br>@Albert: You have played with archaebob before, what is your opinion?"}

I used to come into Day 1 as an instigator, never as deliberately rude as Wake, but similarly convinced that the key to generating content was to elicit emotional reactions from people.  I was very quick to believe that I had uncovered all of the scum in the first 25 pages of a game, and was more than happy to browbeat the town into following my lead.  They often did.  We often lost.  I was almost always unlynchable and high up on people's town lists, but I was also frequently wrong, and my play was very polarizing to the games I was in.  For these reasons, my town record is actually pretty bad.<br><br>I've returned to mafia after a turbulent year of heartbreak and epiphany to see if I am now equipped to break into that top tier of play.  There's aspects of my old town meta that I've identified as egocentric in their motivation, and that I'm persuaded I can do without.  I've read over Vi's guide a lot.  I'm fascinated by the quietness of Albert's new meta (my guess is that his arc as a player is not too different from mine).  What you've seen has been my attempt to reconcile all of these different considerations with what I still think are important priorities Day 1.<br><br>You can make fun of me for being a hopeless, sophomoric romantic all you want, but let's get real here, who are you kidding?  You've got a penchant for graffiti art, pokemon, and quirky usernames.  Your interest in mafia is overtly psychological and literary. \"Method acting\" is in your active vocabulary.  You're fascinated by people and their veneers, and you've singled me out because you think I have one and you want to be the person to tear it down.  You've noted that my beat down of Wake can be read as an open letter to myself.  I suspect this charade you're playing with me follows a similar principle.<br><br>So let's cut the BS.  You don't have a case, except to suggest that I'm enough of a genius to be pulling things off as scum.  You've correctly ascertained (look at you go) that by a hairline my play is self-conscious, and you've decided to dedicate your focus to provoking that one little sliver of my psyche.  This is a task which despite your alignment you can pursue organically because you genuinely believe you're onto something and you think it'll probably read that way.  After all, this is why you play mafia, to use your unique command of empathy to make the case that nobody else is equipped to make.  Right now, it enables you to plausibly tunnelvision, because after all, if I'm actually scum and you are the only person who is sufficiently artsy to realize it, you've gotta act <span style=\"font-style: italic\">now</span> before you get lynched or night killed.  You can sell that to the town and it's not an explicitly inconsistent narrative.<br><br>The truth, Banksys, as I'm afraid we both know, is that <span style=\"font-style: italic\">you're</span> scum.  You're deliberately picking on someone whose position in the town is secure, not so much as a scum maneuver to dislodge him, but more because it's an <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=1875705#p1875705\" class=\"postlink\">edgy and confident thing to do</a>.  And after a train wreck Day 1 in which most people here have (despite your efforts to <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5262044#p5262044\" class=\"postlink\">simulate spontaneity</a>) developed scum gut reads on you, going after me is your best bet to active lurk away the end of the day.  You really expect us to believe that in the mind of town-Banksys, <span style=\"font-style: italic\">archaebob</span> is the best lynch today?  The floor is falling out from beneath you, you do not have me pegged, and you aren't fooling any but a small minority of the players here."}

I doubt it, but it's better to wait and get a sure read than when I could identify her as town later (especially since I'm a highly unlikely nightkill with all these PR claims rolling around), so she's also not an optimal lynch for today. Luckily, there's a distinct lack of ArcAngel or Antihero on the main wagons, so there's at least one scum lurking around there."}

At the conclusion of this process she <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5271699#p5271699\" class=\"postlink\">throws down a vote</a> which is almost immediately sheeped by Anti-Hero and Nachomamma.  <br><br>We'll now look in detail at Banksys's first reponse to these votes:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5271943#p5271943\" class=\"postlink\">post 521</a>, Banksys Flareon wrote:</cite>Well shit, that all happened quickly. <br><br>@Lady Lamb: You certainly seem convinced I'm sucm, so <span class=\"noboldsig\">I won't waste time with my answers.</span> </div></blockquote><br><br>No problem here.  It's a nice little edgy quip, and nobody likes having their time wasted.<br><br>Except.  Oh.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Banksys wrote:</cite> You are wrong, though I brought this on myself.  I obviously can't speak for me predecessor, so whatever the fuck he was thinking is what he was thinking.  As far as what I was thinking, I expressed it quite clearly in my post that you quoted (as far as my immediate suspicions).  Now there are three parts to that post, and you can decide whether or not you believe me. </div></blockquote><br><br>Pay attention guys.  The <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">content</span> of what she's saying is \"you are absolutely right, I'm so sorry that I earned your suspicions with my behavior, let me explain myself.\"  But the <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">tone</span> is \"you can decide whether or not you believe me.\"  <br><br>right...<br><br>It's that fake edginess again.  You're almost expecting her to continue with:<br><br>\"In fact, I don't even care whether or not you do believe me, because I'm <span style=\"font-style: italic\">not nervous</span>.  After all, I'm town!  Town is <span style=\"font-style: italic\">never</span> nervous.\"<br><br>She then continues -<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Banksys wrote:</cite> Part 2, which is actually the most important, as I think it will explain where you think my scum motivation is coming from, was to fuck with archaebob.  Archaebob is aggressively pro-town, is calm and collected, and directs the town in ways that are hardly questionable in their validity.  Scumhunting such a person is extremely difficult, so I did several things to test out how he would react.  I joined his NicCage wagon and cited his article (which was actually pretty good) to see how he would warm up to buddying.  Then he asked me about my origins in mafia directly, so I decided to not give him a straight answer and force him to chase me.  I wanted to see how far his pro-town thing would go, and if he really kept it up I wanted to get a feel for how genuine it was or if I thought it was an act.  Then I unvoted NicCage right after archaebob unvoted him to see if archaebob would vote NicCage again.  He didn't, and while I'm less convinced of his towniness than some others have said or implied, I don't have anywhere further to go with that line of inquiry, at least not yet.  <br><br>Third I just got off a House of Cards kick and I wanted to show up all badass sounding like Francis Underwood, so that act screwed me.</div></blockquote><br><br>\"That act screwed me.\"<br><br>That act <span style=\"font-style: italic\">screwed</span> me.  I'm so sorry, your suspicions are completely legitimate because I was <span style=\"font-style: italic\">acting</span>.  I totally understand why you think I'm scum, and I apologize for confusing you.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Banksys wrote:</cite>Now as to my suspicions, I am voting ace, and will continue to vote ace for the immediate future. <span class=\"noboldsig\">I made a no secret of my suspicion for him.</span> So, Mrs. Lady, you would have to accept that I immediately sheeped a wagon on my scum partner in order to either bus them out or distance myself from them. If the timing of all this sits well with you as something a scum team would do, then by all means continue to vote me.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Now I'm done defending myself. </span></div></blockquote><br><br>\"You have no right to suspect me, because I was very careful to make sure my reasoning was all completely explained at every point in the game for precisely this reason, so you can't accuse me of suspecting someone that I didn't already say I was going to suspect.<br><br>And with <span style=\"font-style: italic\">that</span>  -<br><br>*flips hair back<br><br>- I'm done wasting my time on this <span style=\"font-style: italic\">obviously</span> silly exercise.\"<br><br>Banksys, you're still playing an act, and it's still screwing you.<br><br>But ok, fine, whatever.  So then she diverts course for a while and <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5275727#p5275727\" class=\"postlink\">goes after me</a>, which is an interaction I recommend you go read in dual-iso, as it was fairly straightforward and I didn't mince my words.  After some mind games and sabre-rattling she backs down with <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5279895#p5279895\" class=\"postlink\">this post</a>, followed immediately by this:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5279909#p5279909\" class=\"postlink\">post 680</a>, Banksys Flareon wrote:</cite>Fuck it. <span class=\"noboldsig\"> unvote, vote:Lady Lamb </span><br><br>I want answers out of you</div></blockquote><br><br>Answers?  What answers does she want exactly?  She didn't seem very confused before about why LLD suspected her.  In fact, for an innocent townie being wrongly accused, I'd say she was unusually conciliatory.  I mean, talk about a convenient wagon hop.  Just as I'm starting to seriously breathe down her neck she declares a truce and throws her weight behind the Rampage led attack on her then primary attacker.<br><br>I don't know about you guys, but I don't find Banksys's play genuine at all.  It reads as deeply calculated to me in almost everything she posts.  I'm by no means preemptively exonerating LLD from the case against her, but it's not as compelling as the one against Banksys.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">confirm vote: Banksys Flareon</span>"}

However, brushing off attacks has only recently been a part of my defense.  My first defensive post, which you were kind enough to quote, is entirely conciliatory because I did fuck up there and I admitted to it.  But the tone of \"believe me if you want to\" is supposed to keep it in line with over-confident brushing off?  I invite everyone to reread that themselves and decide if they agree with archaebob.  <br><br>The middle part of your case I am uninterested in.  It deals only with my perceived tone in a text based game.  If everyone else reads it the same way then you should lynch me.  <br><br>RE: LLD:  The entire case on LLD is based on her not giving answers to her insistence that <span style=\"font-style: italic\">I</span> am scum.  What answers did you think I wanted?  My vote on you was going nowhere and LLD was full on attacking me with zero case.  My vote on her had the dual effect of applying pressure for such a case and supporting a wagon I agreed with.  <br><br>But I thought I was clearly explaining all my reads in order to justify them later?  I didn't do that with LLD, I changed my mind after reading Albert's case against her and seeing its validity.  Each of the things you have accused me of doing consistently are things I have done <span style=\"font-style: italic\">sometimes</span>.  You have accused me of being highly calculating and acting, ok, then what is my goal here?  Simply not to be lynched?  I'm not doing a very good job of that, am I?  Is there some townie I'm trying terribly hard to kill off?  No, I've been asking questions of a number of players and have moved my vote and my voice to wherever I felt they were needed.  <br><br>If I were scum I could have easily lurked away the rest of the day.

What you <span style=\"font-style: italic\">will</span> see a lot in smart scum is a stitched-together quality in their thought process and reactions.  They write things for effect.  What they do doesn't line up with what they say.  Or it lines up <span style=\"font-style: italic\">completely</span>, in a kind of preplanned way.  Also, what they say doesn't line up with how they're saying it.  It's a subtle thing, and it's really just a question of putting yourself in their shoes, trying to imagine yourself with their personality, and seeing whether what they're doing lines up more with what you'd expect from town or scum.  In the case of Banksys, I see scum all over, because I'm constantly reminded of things I've done or felt tempted to do as scum.  I feel it on my skin.  <br><br>I'm really not sure about LadyL.  Yeah, she doesn't explain stuff, which comes with certain advantages and disadvantages for town.  Among the disadvantages of playing that way is that if for whatever reason you start to trigger scum gut reads you're in a poor position to defend yourself.  At the moment I'm inclined to think that she's town, because her reads largely agree with mine.  I also don't think that flying off the handle is a scum tell.  At all.  So, while I understand some of the motivation behind the wagon, I don't think she's the best Day 1 lynch. <br><br>I don't buy any of Nacho's reasoning, especially since he hasn't answered my question about his initial Banksys vote."}

This is the epitome of successful lurking.  No wonder he offered no real opinion on the final wagons of D-1, he wasn't around for them.  not only are his posts infrequent at best, they are largely devoid of content. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>hodge wrote:</cite>Some quick notes<br><br>As people have asked, my vote this is the first game i've been involved with out of the road to rome and all of that had RVS, I admit I assumed it was similar here.<br><br>Wake, I'm getting a feeling of while contributing some information and ideas there is a fair deal of avoidance tactics and smoke screening so that people are unsure on whether to vote or not. Also what if there is no tracker it would mean no counter claim anyway?<br><br>On Squilly, the varying votes and lack of information, doesn't appear great but attracts a level of suspicion that wouldn't be wise as scum.</div></blockquote><br><br>This is hodge's first post in the game with actual content, and you'll notice it is post-Wake claim.  This is classic waffly reading that can be easily cited or changed later. <br><br>Second he calls out Squilly for what he will continue to do for the entire day.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>hodge wrote:</cite>Think NicCage is fine for now, I don't see any real hard evidence of scummy behaviour, but keeping him at null for now.<br><br>Because of the way they have acted so far<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">VOTE: Squilly</span></div></blockquote><br><br>This is post number 4.  Here he drops his first vote and first \"reads.\"  This is hardly \"hard evidence\" to use his words. <br><br>archaebob calls him out for it in 303.<br><br>Hodge is then absent for some time and ignores questions until antihero pseudo-screams at him.  <br><br>Archaebob starts going after him for this, so he defends himself with this:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>hodge wrote:</cite>I admit I haven't posted regularly enough, today I would have but have had some laptop issues which I think i've solved.<br><br>However, I want to ask why you want to sheep someone who most people have at null (even if its because of a lack of evidence) then getting a bandwagon on someone who more people suspect. We have 2 people with a fair amount of votes on, what would be the reasoning for moving a good amount of votes onto someone else and being in the same position? Have we really got everything we can from where the votes are atm?</div></blockquote><br><br>He is disavowing the legitimacy of any and all lurker wagons in favor of major wagons only.  You'll notice he is conceptually defending his lurking while refusing to admit that he is doing it.  His only actual defense is varying excuses for lack of content, each time promising more.  <br><br>The kicker:  He LITERALLY NEVER changed his vote throughout all of D-1 after the RVS.  That's absurd.  Why has no one else called him out for this?  There needs to be a massive Hodge wagon. <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">unvote, vote: Hodge</span><br><br><br><br>The pattern continues throughout.  I am not going to overload this post into a wall illustrating the same thing.  I encourage all of you to iso Hodge and decide if you think his play has been sufficient.  I would say not."}

Rampage", "content": "I felt like Banksys' non sequiturs with archaebob were scummy, and that she was very misleading at several points in the day. That being said, she definitely stumbled down the scummy ladder after last night. I feel like my main concerns with her are her long contrived posts and the LLD vote with horrible reasoning. What I found when I looked back at that interaction during the night, is that I could partially see how a pressure vote for information could have quickly turned into a real one considering how LLD was so tunnelvisioned. If someone wants you dead and their alignment is unknown to you, and one of you is getting lynched, would you be voting them as your counterwagon? You bet. <br><br>The other thing is the archaebob kill. Archaebob may have correctly identified the entire scumteam yesterday and was killed because he posed a larger threat than any PR. Or maybe once the scum kill the real PRs, they realize that the PR fakeclaiming scum will quickly be exposed. In any case, there's no way that Banksys' actions yesterday and today outweigh the scummy quickhammer or the lack of movement from NicCage's corner after the wrong vote count. It's simply not something that he could miss. Every time there's a vote count, you instinctively verify if your vote is placed correctly. He even posted after that vote count. He either didn't see the thread, or I think, read it and didn't mention a thing in twilight when we thought that LLD was dead. And there was an entire day left before the deadline when LLD was hammered. Assuming that Antihero is the cop, the scum had to get rid of the doctor during the day or that would set them back 2 investigations, plus a suicide run if there's a watcher targeting Antihero. <br><br>Another one, Hodge had his vote on LLD all day yesterday, refused to unvote when I called him out on it a couple days away before the deadline, on account of pressure, and sat there right up until the hammer. Out of all the players, I'm also careful about Nacho. I think that he's dangerous. He's good at directing the town and influencing votes. Aside from Antihero, who I'm willing to believe due to Viera, Uctitron may be the only player I'm not afraid of at this point."}

He has never had a major wagon on him, nor has he led one.  He has active lurked his way all the way to the present.  Even now, when asked for a case, you go for the much easier insistence that StrangerCouf reread, cuz who could argue with that?  Of course we should all be rereading, so townie points for you without you having to say anything.  I think the pattern is pretty clear.  <br><br>Secondly, Ulctriton has hammered (or declared intent to hammer) on a few townies.  He did not post significant content on these people, he simply was the one to pull the trigger.  Normally I'd say that was a bold move for scum, but the WIFOM of it could make that his strategy all by itself.  He certainly would not be the first scum willing to get his hands dirty, and his actions have not only failed to generate discussion, they have quite literally stopped it.  <br><br>Therefore I must vote Aptil or Ulctriton.  I am willing to wait to vote either of these people, but in Aptil's case there is little point.  If he and I are both townies then we've already lost.

That being said, she definitely stumbled down the scummy ladder after last night. I feel like my main concerns with her are her long contrived posts and the LLD vote with horrible reasoning. What I found when I looked back at that interaction during the night, is that I could partially see how a pressure vote for information could have quickly turned into a real one considering how LLD was so tunnelvisioned. If someone wants you dead and their alignment is unknown to you, and one of you is getting lynched, would you be voting them as your counterwagon? You bet. <br><br>The other thing is the archaebob kill. Archaebob may have correctly identified the entire scumteam yesterday and was killed because he posed a larger threat than any PR. Or maybe once the scum kill the real PRs, they realize that the PR fakeclaiming scum will quickly be exposed. In any case, there's no way that Banksys' actions yesterday and today outweigh the scummy quickhammer or the lack of movement from NicCage's corner after the wrong vote count. It's simply not something that he could miss. Every time there's a vote count, you instinctively verify if your vote is placed correctly. He even posted after that vote count. He either didn't see the thread, or I think, read it and didn't mention a thing in twilight when we thought that LLD was dead. And there was an entire day left before the deadline when LLD was hammered. Assuming that Antihero is the cop, the scum had to get rid of the doctor during the day or that would set them back 2 investigations, plus a suicide run if there's a watcher targeting Antihero. <br><br>Another one, Hodge had his vote on LLD all day yesterday, refused to unvote when I called him out on it a couple days away before the deadline, on account of pressure, and sat there right up until the hammer. Out of all the players, I'm also careful about Nacho. I think that he's dangerous.

Rampage, StrangerCoug, Ulctriton, Aptil.  <br><br>Given that this is the case, I obviously feel that Aptil and Ulctriton are the last scum.  Aptil has clung to the shadows throughout this game.  He has never had a major wagon on him, nor has he led one.  He has active lurked his way all the way to the present.  Even now, when asked for a case, you go for the much easier insistence that StrangerCouf reread, cuz who could argue with that?  Of course we should all be rereading, so townie points for you without you having to say anything.  I think the pattern is pretty clear.  <br><br>Secondly, Ulctriton has hammered (or declared intent to hammer) on a few townies.  He did not post significant content on these people, he simply was the one to pull the trigger.  Normally I'd say that was a bold move for scum, but the WIFOM of it could make that his strategy all by itself.  He certainly would not be the first scum willing to get his hands dirty, and his actions have not only failed to generate discussion, they have quite literally stopped it.  <br><br>Therefore I must vote Aptil or Ulctriton.  I am willing to wait to vote either of these people, but in Aptil's case there is little point.  If he and I are both townies then we've already lost.  If he is scum, then his buddy isn't going to contribute to his quick lynch.  <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: Aptil</span></div></blockquote><br>Please show me posts where StrangerCoug has posted content.

Instead of going after the claimed cop though, the scum employ a strategy to kill archeabob instead. If I remember correctly they were looking for a SK or other PR, and were risking letting the cop live. Whatever the reason, it really worked for them because the first thing archeabob says when he gets into the dead thread is:<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Banksys<br>Salmonella<br>and then either Rampage(Godfather/SK) or Nachomamma<br><br>amirite?</div></blockquote><br><br>Scum kill the guy who had them pegged. At the same time, Antihero investigates ABR, leading to ABR being pronounced town by the cop. This works very well for the scum who can now kill the cop the next night, knowing there is nothing more they can gain from him. SD's proclamation that VA killed Antihero ends up being perfectly timed because even though SD was going to do it anyway, VA had actually tracked SD to Antihero and knew the truth. Instead of SD being the easy lynch, he turns it around and gets town to lynch their last PR. It was a suicide move, but it worked the best way it could have.<br><br>Thanks to all the players for sticking with the game, I appreciate you all being apart of my first mod experience.
