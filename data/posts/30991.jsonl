He should have some rough estimate of how much experience he has.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">jackofspades ~ +1.</div> He random'd in (6), and answered archaebob's question fully (16). He then went and asked if others would do so. That makes me feel slightly that that's a Town thing to do. He then votes for Squilly in (89), and questions why he voted for Smoker (that said, I placed my bluff vote on Smoker earlier on). I have a slight Town read on him.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Naomi-Tan ~  0.</div> I love the name Naomi. It's cute. Anyways, she random'd in (8) for theaceofspades. She refused to answer this 1st part of archaebob's question in (37), because \"I think this question could be used by scum to work out who is weaker and better alive late game, so im not gonna answer it.\" I have mixed feelings on this, but my gut tells me this sentiment is more right than wrong. Curiously, in (59) Naomi asked \"wait... why is he being paranoid?,\" which doesn't make sense because I never explicitly said Nic was being paranoid, but that in general activity is good for Town and paranoia isn't. A good many VTs and PRs have been hung due to paranoid Townies. Her feathers are a bit ruffled due to my abrasive (yet effective) nature (88). I'm only abrasive in Mafia. Catch \"Wake\" on usmessageboards.com and you'll find me to be quite the gentleman. I'm getting a null read on her.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">archaebob ~  +2.</div> RV'd in (13). Offered up a 3-part question in (14). Then he pined for more people to answer his question, and also gave some general gameplay thoughts in (24). May be helpful Town. Or not. Slight Town read.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">hodge ~ 0.</div> RV'd Salmonella Dreams. That's it. Null read.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Squilly ~ -1.</div> RV's 3 seperate times. No explanation at all. Slight Scum read.  <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">aptil ~ +3.</div> RV'd in (19). Initially questioned how the RQS helped, and says \"It maybe a conversation starter in early game but surely nothing that will help us with scum hunting.\" I'm unsure what to think of it at that point. However, he then asks Squilly why he voted for jackofspades in (23). Slight Town read there. He later answers his question in full in (26). That nullifies the earlier feeling of uncertainty; slight Town read. He then obliges jack's question of what to do while hunting, which is, as well, helpful. He also implies/asks Nic in (33) and (38) on how Nic hadn't voted for someone but was wanting a wagon to ensue (If I've got this wrong, aptil, please let me know). In (83) he questions Antihero on his hapless vote for me. (86): \"I thought getting reactions out of people was a good thing.\" He is right, and Antihero is not. He has 16 posts thus far, and has contributed a bit. So, I have a Town read on him.<br>\n <br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">NicCage and SalmonellaDreams ~ 0.</div> I'm not on good terms with Nic at this point, so I'm not sure I can give a fair reading on them. We've explained our sides already. <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">If anyone wants to hear my reads on them, I'll do so when I can.</div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Antihero ~ -1.</div> Voted for me in (82). He doesn't really explain his vote, but, like people do when they haven't read things through, he makes a rather dumb comment about me. Apparently he's ignorant. He later unvotes in (99), which is after I've started typing up this post. He felt so certain earlier, yet he then turned on a dime. I'd like to hear him explain himself. I've got a slight Scum read on him right now, but if he explains himself and otherwise tries to be helpful and willing to listen, my impression of him will likely change.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Radiant Cowbells ~ 0.</div> She hasn't posted yet. But, I do know that in another game with JasonWazza she hammered herself rather angrily Day 1, and she was the Town Doctor.

Null so far.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">theaceofspades ~ -1.</div> In (5) he voted randomly; null read on that. However, in (43), he declined to answer the 1st part of archaebob's questions in full. He should have some rough estimate of how much experience he has.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">jackofspades ~ +1.</div> He random'd in (6), and answered archaebob's question fully (16). He then went and asked if others would do so. That makes me feel slightly that that's a Town thing to do. He then votes for Squilly in (89), and questions why he voted for Smoker (that said, I placed my bluff vote on Smoker earlier on). I have a slight Town read on him.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Naomi-Tan ~  0.</div> I love the name Naomi. It's cute. Anyways, she random'd in (8) for theaceofspades. She refused to answer this 1st part of archaebob's question in (37), because \"I think this question could be used by scum to work out who is weaker and better alive late game, so im not gonna answer it.\" I have mixed feelings on this, but my gut tells me this sentiment is more right than wrong. Curiously, in (59) Naomi asked \"wait... why is he being paranoid?,\" which doesn't make sense because I never explicitly said Nic was being paranoid, but that in general activity is good for Town and paranoia isn't. A good many VTs and PRs have been hung due to paranoid Townies. Her feathers are a bit ruffled due to my abrasive (yet effective) nature (88). I'm only abrasive in Mafia. Catch \"Wake\" on usmessageboards.com and you'll find me to be quite the gentleman. I'm getting a null read on her.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">archaebob ~  +2.</div> RV'd in (13). Offered up a 3-part question in (14). Then he pined for more people to answer his question, and also gave some general gameplay thoughts in (24). May be helpful Town. Or not. Slight Town read.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">hodge ~ 0.</div> RV'd Salmonella Dreams. That's it. Null read.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Squilly ~ -1.</div> RV's 3 seperate times. No explanation at all. Slight Scum read.  <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">aptil ~ +3.</div> RV'd in (19). Initially questioned how the RQS helped, and says \"It maybe a conversation starter in early game but surely nothing that will help us with scum hunting.\" I'm unsure what to think of it at that point. However, he then asks Squilly why he voted for jackofspades in (23). Slight Town read there. He later answers his question in full in (26). That nullifies the earlier feeling of uncertainty; slight Town read. He then obliges jack's question of what to do while hunting, which is, as well, helpful. He also implies/asks Nic in (33) and (38) on how Nic hadn't voted for someone but was wanting a wagon to ensue (If I've got this wrong, aptil, please let me know). In (83) he questions Antihero on his hapless vote for me. (86): \"I thought getting reactions out of people was a good thing.\" He is right, and Antihero is not. He has 16 posts thus far, and has contributed a bit. So, I have a Town read on him.<br>\n <br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">NicCage and SalmonellaDreams ~ 0.</div> I'm not on good terms with Nic at this point, so I'm not sure I can give a fair reading on them. We've explained our sides already. <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">If anyone wants to hear my reads on them, I'll do so when I can.</div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Antihero ~ -1.</div> Voted for me in (82). He doesn't really explain his vote, but, like people do when they haven't read things through, he makes a rather dumb comment about me. Apparently he's ignorant. He later unvotes in (99), which is after I've started typing up this post. He felt so certain earlier, yet he then turned on a dime. I'd like to hear him explain himself. I've got a slight Scum read on him right now, but if he explains himself and otherwise tries to be helpful and willing to listen, my impression of him will likely change.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Radiant Cowbells ~ 0.</div> She hasn't posted yet. But, I do know that in another game with JasonWazza she hammered herself rather angrily Day 1, and she was the Town Doctor.

I know that a lot of the time people are giving one or two sentence responses to things that have just been posted, but none of that carries over in iso if you don't quote.  I don't mean to encumber anyone; it's just borne very true in my experience that when a thread is easily researched the town keeps better track of the game narrative and enjoys the game more.

I've asked you for something fairly straightforward: explain how your ideal Day 1 would transpire.  What characterizes intelligent town play at the start of the game when we have no information?  You make very strong claims about the stupidity of everyone else's approach, yet I am still awaiting a semi-articulate thought from you regarding this important question of mafia theory.  Do you actually have any insights to share, or is it all bluster and pomp with you?  Reading your posts, I don't see a calm, collected, intelligent individual who is dishing out badly needed lessons to the throng.  I see a cocky 14 - 19 year old who fancies himself a budding young intellectual in the making, but who as a result of some severe, latent personal insecurity, feels the need to roleplay online as a cocksure, dominant, take-no-shit type, except you have neither the writing chops nor the critical awareness to pull it off, so instead you spam schoolyard cliches (\"don't piss in my wheaties and call it milk.\"  ooh.  you really told him) in a flailing attempt to establish your psychical superiority over those who have asked you reasonable questions and are quickly growing bored of your antics.  I hate it to break it to you, but we are not impressed with your affected self-assurance, and you have not actually done anything to demonstrate your maturity or your intelligence.  Your posts are weak, your contribution is non-existent, and your schtick is transparent as air. <br>\n<br>\nFrom where I'm sitting, it looks like you have two options.<br>\n<br>\n1) You can try to call my bluff and push the pedal to the floor.  Ooh yeah, you're the man.  After all, if you just commit completely enough we're bound to realize that we're all \"village idiots\" and that you really are Anu and Enlil's gift to mafia.  Go ahead, write that snarky, dismissive response to this post.  I'm excited to see what new insults you can come up with, and I'll miss you after your lynch.  <br>\n<br>\n2) You can recognize that some of the things you are being asked to do are not insane, and that it is in fact <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">your</div> pride that has lead to the dialogue deteriorating this far.  Nobody in this town knows your alignment; it is <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">you</div> who are being rude if you refuse to answer simple questions for no clear reason, and <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">you</div> who has his head up his ass (\"God's special little snowflake\") if you get indignant when people fail to prostrate themselves before you while demanding answers.  You can take a step back, make a face-saving post, and then start playing like someone who is actually more interested in winning the game for the town than in having their ego stroked.  I strongly recommend this option.<br>\n<br>\nHere, I have <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dexIA_OfLzg\" class=\"postlink\">something which will help</a>.

No one seems to give a shit when they get voted, and no one seems to give a shit when they don't give a shit.  Many of the accusations flying around, albeit most are at Wake, seem to center around doing things without a reason.  At the risk of sounding like an IC of some newbie game, can we all try to post our reasoning a little more clearly?  Some of you are, and some of you aren't.  Please don't waste mooore time informing me that you have in fact been posting diligently as I'm sure Wake will anyway. <br>\n<br>\nWhen I was reading the thread I immediately had my mind made up to vote Ace.  I saw his post in which he suggested he just might be able to morally stomach lynching Wake for being so anti-town, and he might be scum anyway, right?  My stomach actually turned at that one, it's kind of an exciting feeling when you think you've just cracked the code.  Then archaebob voted him, and I thought \"oh you, archaebob. Well done.\"  Then lo and behold archaebob's reasoning is the same as mine.  This was both exciting and disappointing.  It means my suspicions of ace are not unfounded, but it also means the trail has run dry (for the moment).  It was a very scummy thing to say, but a line of inquiry would end fairly quickly, especially in this town.  Plus, Albert had the good sense to say:<br>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I'm able to follow his line of thinking so far; it makes sense. <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Scum usually don't change their minds as easily as town in my experience.</div></div></blockquote> <br>\n<br>\nSo I'm sure we'll see scum changing their minds all over the place and being happy to do it.  <br>\n<br>\nAlso, @Albert:  I apologize on behalf of Radiant Cowbell <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\";)\" title=\"Wink\"><br>\n<br>\nSo!  I will return to Ace in the not too distant future.  I commit to that, I float my read out there, etc. etc.  I'd like you all to do the same as much as possible.  <br>\n<br>\n@Ace:  Before I actually vote you, I've noticed the vast majority of your posts are simply reactions to Wake's resemblance to an anal cavity.  You've gotten away with this because he is overpowering all discussions with hints about how great he is (I'm really stretching the meaning of the word hint).  I would very much like it of you would post clear reads of at least two of three players who you find scummiest, with reasons why, etc.  <br>\n<br>\n@All, but especially Wake:  The reason I'm not voting Ace yet is because I think there is a better place for my vote in the immediate future.  See, I actually read archaebob's article on environments and I found a great deal to agree with (for those of you who don't know what I'm talking about, it's in one of his posts directed at Wake when Wake starts accusing him).  As I said earlier, a line of inquiry for Ace is relatively fruitless until he posts more, though I'm far from opposed to a pressure wagon on him if such a thing materializes.  <br>\n<br>\n@Wake:  Your play style is bad for town.  I spent 90% of my read being annoyed and frustrated with you.  You have created an environment in which it is easy for scum to hide.  They can all just get upset with you and spend pages and pages calling you anti-town, pressuring you to be nicer and to post more content, and never feel obligated to talk about anyone else.  Town are going to do that too, because you really are a huge asshole.  Your playstyle has not resulted in a suspicion I find remotely useful.  You attacked archaebob for the most inane reasons and use your asshole personality as a fallback to avoid having to explain yourself.  You've used your asshole personality to avoid answering Albert's questions as well, even after being asked directly several times.  You had all your softclaiming shit, and then hard claim of Town Tracker.  This is more anti-town behavior that scum players can latch onto and have a nice warm place to ride through day 1 in.  You need to stop.  You need to answer questions directed at you.  <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: NicCage</div><br>\n<br>\nNic, you were great at the beginning in trying to generate discussion, then you fell into the Wake trap, then you kind of flailed blindly to get out of the Wake trap, and since then you haven't done anything very useful, including (until very recently) give a serious response to accusations of you.

The majority among us don't have any stake in ignoring or twisting your comments; we just have limited energy, and you chosen to play in a way that does not reward us for interacting with you.  I know you think you've been posting \"real content\" in the past several pages, but you have a lot to learn about how town opinion works.  You cannot separate good argumentation from your personal credibility and treat them as different things.  This is not arbitrary; it's a fact of mafia and of life, and there's good reasons for it.  If you want to turn over a new leaf and start playing in an effective and moderated fashion, I don't think you'll find that people preemptively disqualify your points simply because they are coming from you.  <br>\n<br>\nDo you actually suspect Nic at all?  You had your vote on him before.  Well, right now the attention is on him.  You'll note that we've been making cases, and that he's been responding.  Feel free to contribute, or to argue for why we should focus our attention elsewhere.

Rather, it is a narrative of ace&#8217;s behavior and corresponding thought process which bespeaks participation in the informed minority.

Wake&#8217;s behavior was indeed detrimental to the town, and I&#8217;ve myself made the case in various outlets that policy lynching the extremely unhelpful is sometimes necessary.  What bothers me here is the wording, and the energy.  &#8220;I&#8217;m almost willing to lynch you.&#8221;  Who announces stuff like that?  Well, really heady and overcautious players sometimes do, but we know that ace isn&#8217;t one of those.  He answered &#8220;intuition&#8221; to my RQS question, and his sharp, unproofread, not infrequently sarcastic writing doesn&#8217;t draw up the image of someone who habitually builds geometric armor around themselves before acting.  No, this is someone who is unconsciously giving themselves options ahead of time.  Watch how he feels compelled to softly weave every contingency into the thread.  It&#8217;s redundant; overexplained.  &#8220;But I won&#8217;t lynch you at deadline if I get a scumread from someone else!  That might happen!  If I start to say I suspect someone else and I don&#8217;t still want to lynch you I&#8217;m not being inconsistent!&#8221;  He senses internally that his reasoning is fabricated, and is shoring it up with tiny, unnecessary precautions.  Where&#8217;s the teeth?  He&#8217;s justifying himself to town-Wake instead of imposing himself to a faceless player who has thus far acted bizarrely.  I suggest to you that this is because he already knows the roles.<br>\n\t\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5257017#p5257017\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5257017#p5257017\" data-post-id=\"5257017\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 154</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=20249\">theaceofspades</a> wrote:</cite>ah screw it.<br>\n<br>\nthe PR hinting rubs me the wrong way<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: wake</span></div></blockquote>\n\n\tThe recklessness of this post sharpens the disconnect between the post we discussed above and his actual personality.  &#8220;Ah screw it.

If he had noticed the PR hinting before, then why did he go to such great lengths to tell Wake that he thought he was town?  He spent a lot of time making this fine distinction between wanting someone lynched for being anti-town and wanting someone lynched for being scum (which he adamantly insisted was NOT his reason for wanting Wake lynched).   If the PR hinting rubbed him the wrong way, wouldn&#8217;t there have been a little more bite before?

Keeping this in mind, what follows is not an attempt to point out incontrovertible facts which &#8220;prove&#8221; that ace is scum.  Rather, it is a narrative of ace&#8217;s behavior and corresponding thought process which bespeaks participation in the informed minority.  As he defends himself, look not for logical consistency; scum always has it.  Instead, try and reconcile everything he has done with the emotional fabric of a town player.  Ultimately, you have to trust your intuition.  It is the most powerful calculator in the universe.<br>\n\t<br>\nThe game starts, Wake is being a dumbass, lots of yelling, blah blah blah.

Wake&#8217;s behavior was indeed detrimental to the town, and I&#8217;ve myself made the case in various outlets that policy lynching the extremely unhelpful is sometimes necessary.  What bothers me here is the wording, and the energy.  &#8220;I&#8217;m almost willing to lynch you.&#8221;  Who announces stuff like that?  Well, really heady and overcautious players sometimes do, but we know that ace isn&#8217;t one of those.  He answered &#8220;intuition&#8221; to my RQS question, and his sharp, unproofread, not infrequently sarcastic writing doesn&#8217;t draw up the image of someone who habitually builds geometric armor around themselves before acting.  No, this is someone who is unconsciously giving themselves options ahead of time.  Watch how he feels compelled to softly weave every contingency into the thread.  It&#8217;s redundant; overexplained.  &#8220;But I won&#8217;t lynch you at deadline if I get a scumread from someone else!  That might happen!  If I start to say I suspect someone else and I don&#8217;t still want to lynch you I&#8217;m not being inconsistent!&#8221;  He senses internally that his reasoning is fabricated, and is shoring it up with tiny, unnecessary precautions.  Where&#8217;s the teeth?  He&#8217;s justifying himself to town-Wake instead of imposing himself to a faceless player who has thus far acted bizarrely.  I suggest to you that this is because he already knows the roles.<br>\n\t<div style=\"display:inline;color:#BF0000\">i often announce stuff like that, that's where my thoughts wer. about \"this\" close to wanting him lynched. feel free to check the tiny bit of meta this account has. I know I've said almost those exact words before.  Why should I be dogmatic when I myself am unsure? it's like your case is \"ace isn't sure he wants to call wake scum straight up, so he must be scummy.  Also, ITP i'm intuitive, impulsive and sarcastic (i'll interject that in my personal life, that is how I act, it's a layer of emotional armor so to speak, it allows me to deal with people nicely, despite the fact that I mistrust and dislike many of them)</div>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5257017#p5257017\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5257017#p5257017\" data-post-id=\"5257017\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 154</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=20249\">theaceofspades</a> wrote:</cite>ah screw it.<br>\n<br>\nthe PR hinting rubs me the wrong way<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: wake</span></div></blockquote>\n\n\tThe recklessness of this post sharpens the disconnect between the post we discussed above and his actual personality.  &#8220;Ah screw it.

If he had noticed the PR hinting before, then why did he go to such great lengths to tell Wake that he thought he was town?  He spent a lot of time making this fine distinction between wanting someone lynched for being anti-town and wanting someone lynched for being scum (which he adamantly insisted was NOT his reason for wanting Wake lynched).

Yeah you say your opinion has changed, but it hasn&#8217;t changed very organically.  I also don&#8217;t find your later explanation of why Nic came out badly from that exchange very satisfactory.  And I feel like I'm watching you calculate almost everything you write.  For example, why would you bring up that wake's claim might cause you to suspect him if it's one of two roles?  Aren't you worried at all that Wake might notice that and think more carefully about his choice?  If I was town and I knew that there was a role Wake could claim that would be extremely suspect to me, I would want to keep my mouth shut and see if he fell into the trap.  I'd be excited to spring it on him when he overstepped.  But no.  Instead you went with \"here's a little preview for why I might suddenly start to suspect Wake again if he does this one narrowly defined thing we'll see.\"  We'll see?

It's not necessary to write out all the thoughts I have since disregarded. same principle here. This isn't my diary. <br>\nMaybe that's what you'd do, but I feel it puts more pressure on someone to tell them you have definite expectations, especially if they don't know what they are, as it happens he'd already claimed, so it was moot. but the point is, be telling him he had two \"bad\" answers, wouldn't have made it easier for him to avoid them then if I'd kept my mouth shut, perhaps he wouldn't have claimed at all, but that seems unlikely.  Instead, it would place more pressure on him, and make him more likely to slip as scum, as town he would have no pressure, because he would tell the truth either way.

He then went and asked if others would do so. That makes me feel slightly that that's a Town thing to do. He then votes for Squilly in (89), and questions why he voted for Smoker (that said, I placed my bluff vote on Smoker earlier on). I have a slight Town read on him.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Naomi-Tan ~  0.</div> I love the name Naomi. It's cute. Anyways, she random'd in (8) for theaceofspades. She refused to answer this 1st part of archaebob's question in (37), because \"I think this question could be used by scum to work out who is weaker and better alive late game, so im not gonna answer it.\" I have mixed feelings on this, but my gut tells me this sentiment is more right than wrong. Curiously, in (59) Naomi asked \"wait... why is he being paranoid?,\" which doesn't make sense because I never explicitly said Nic was being paranoid, but that in general activity is good for Town and paranoia isn't. A good many VTs and PRs have been hung due to paranoid Townies. Her feathers are a bit ruffled due to my abrasive (yet effective) nature (88). I'm only abrasive in Mafia. Catch \"Wake\" on usmessageboards.com and you'll find me to be quite the gentleman.

Initially questioned how the RQS helped, and says \"It maybe a conversation starter in early game but surely nothing that will help us with scum hunting.\" I'm unsure what to think of it at that point. However, he then asks Squilly why he voted for jackofspades in (23). Slight Town read there. He later answers his question in full in (26). That nullifies the earlier feeling of uncertainty; slight Town read. He then obliges jack's question of what to do while hunting, which is, as well, helpful. He also implies/asks Nic in (33) and (38) on how Nic hadn't voted for someone but was wanting a wagon to ensue (If I've got this wrong, aptil, please let me know). In (83) he questions Antihero on his hapless vote for me. (86): \"I thought getting reactions out of people was a good thing.\" He is right, and Antihero is not. He has 16 posts thus far, and has contributed a bit. So, I have a Town read on him.<br>\n <br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">NicCage and SalmonellaDreams ~ 0.</div> I'm not on good terms with Nic at this point, so I'm not sure I can give a fair reading on them.

He doesn't really explain his vote, but, like people do when they haven't read things through, he makes a rather dumb comment about me. Apparently he's ignorant. He later unvotes in (99), which is after I've started typing up this post. He felt so certain earlier, yet he then turned on a dime. I'd like to hear him explain himself. I've got a slight Scum read on him right now, but if he explains himself and otherwise tries to be helpful and willing to listen, my impression of him will likely change.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Radiant Cowbells ~ 0.</div> She hasn't posted yet.

No one seems to give a shit when they get voted, and no one seems to give a shit when they don't give a shit.  Many of the accusations flying around, albeit most are at Wake, seem to center around doing things without a reason.  At the risk of sounding like an IC of some newbie game, can we all try to post our reasoning a little more clearly?  Some of you are, and some of you aren't.  Please don't waste mooore time informing me that you have in fact been posting diligently as I'm sure Wake will anyway. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">When I was reading the thread I immediately had my mind made up to vote Ace.  I saw his post in which he suggested he just might be able to morally stomach lynching Wake for being so anti-town, and he might be scum anyway, right?  My stomach actually turned at that one, it's kind of an exciting feeling when you think you've just cracked the code.  Then archaebob voted him, and I thought \"oh you, archaebob. Well done.\"  Then lo and behold archaebob's reasoning is the same as mine.  This was both exciting and disappointing.  It means my suspicions of ace are not unfounded, but it also means the trail has run dry (for the moment).  It was a very scummy thing to say, but a line of inquiry would end fairly quickly, especially in this town.  Plus, Albert had the good sense to say:</div><br>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I'm able to follow his line of thinking so far; it makes sense. <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Scum usually don't change their minds as easily as town in my experience.</div></div></blockquote> <br>\n<br>\nSo I'm sure we'll see scum changing their minds all over the place and being happy to do it.  <br>\n<br>\nAlso, @Albert:  I apologize on behalf of Radiant Cowbell <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\";)\" title=\"Wink\"><br>\n<br>\nSo!  I will return to Ace in the not too distant future.  I commit to that, I float my read out there, etc. etc.  I'd like you all to do the same as much as possible.  <br>\n<br>\n@Ace:  Before I actually vote you, I've noticed the vast majority of your posts are simply reactions to Wake's resemblance to an anal cavity.  You've gotten away with this because he is overpowering all discussions with hints about how great he is (I'm really stretching the meaning of the word hint).  I would very much like it of you would post clear reads of at least two of three players who you find scummiest, with reasons why, etc.  <br>\n<br>\n@All, but especially Wake:  The reason I'm not voting Ace yet is because I think there is a better place for my vote in the immediate future.  See, I actually read archaebob's article on environments and I found a great deal to agree with (for those of you who don't know what I'm talking about, it's in one of his posts directed at Wake when Wake starts accusing him).  As I said earlier, a line of inquiry for Ace is relatively fruitless until he posts more, though I'm far from opposed to a pressure wagon on him if such a thing materializes.  <br>\n<br>\n@Wake:  Your play style is bad for town.  I spent 90% of my read being annoyed and frustrated with you.  You have created an environment in which it is easy for scum to hide.  They can all just get upset with you and spend pages and pages calling you anti-town, pressuring you to be nicer and to post more content, and never feel obligated to talk about anyone else.  Town are going to do that too, because you really are a huge asshole.  Your playstyle has not resulted in a suspicion I find remotely useful.  You attacked archaebob for the most inane reasons and use your asshole personality as a fallback to avoid having to explain yourself.  You've used your asshole personality to avoid answering Albert's questions as well, even after being asked directly several times.  You had all your softclaiming shit, and then hard claim of Town Tracker.  This is more anti-town behavior that scum players can latch onto and have a nice warm place to ride through day 1 in.  You need to stop.  You need to answer questions directed at you.  <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: NicCage</div><br>\n<br>\nNic, you were great at the beginning in trying to generate discussion, then you fell into the Wake trap, then you kind of flailed blindly to get out of the Wake trap, and since then you haven't done anything very useful, including (until very recently) give a serious response to accusations of you.  There is little to add to archaebob's post responding to yours, though I would like you to feel under great pressure to respond adequately.</div></blockquote>\n <br>\nThis shit doesn't feel genuine, capped off with the Nic vote after calling out Ace?", "time": "Thu Aug 29, 2013 2:00 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=30991&start=475", "forum": "53", "thread": "30991"}

{"number": 521, "id": "5271943", "user": "Banksys Flareon", "user_id": "22399", "content": "Well shit, that all happened quickly.  <br>\n<br>\n@Lady Lamb: You certainly seem convinced I'm sucm, so I won't waste time with my answers.  You are wrong, though I brought this on myself.  I obviously can't speak for me predecessor, so whatever the fuck he was thinking is what he was thinking.  As far as what I was thinking, I expressed it quite clearly in my post that you quoted (as far as my immediate suspicions).  Now there are three parts to that post, and you can decide whether or not you believe me.  First and foremost, the bolded part of the quotation was an, albeit stylized, exact description of my actual reaction.  I read Ace's post and my chest \"literally\" fell.  From that moment on I have believed him to be scum.  <br>\n<br>\nPart 2, which is actually the most important, as I think it will explain where you think my scum motivation is coming from, was to fuck with archaebob.  Archaebob is aggressively pro-town, is calm and collected, and directs the town in ways that are hardly questionable in their validity.  Scumhunting such a person is extremely difficult, so I did several things to test out how he would react.  I joined his NicCage wagon and cited his article (which was actually pretty good) to see how he would warm up to buddying.  Then he asked me about my origins in mafia directly, so I decided to not give him a straight answer and force him to chase me.  I wanted to see how far his pro-town thing would go, and if he really kept it up I wanted to get a feel for how genuine it was or if I thought it was an act.  Then I unvoted NicCage right after archaebob unvoted him to see if archaebob would vote NicCage again.  He didn't, and while I'm less convinced of his towniness than some others have said or implied, I don't have anywhere further to go with that line of inquiry, at least not yet.  <br>\n<br>\nThird I just got off a House of Cards kick and I wanted to show up all badass sounding like Francis Underwood, so that act screwed me.   <br>\n<br>\nNow as to my suspicions, I am voting ace, and will continue to vote ace for the immediate future.  I made a no secret of my suspicion for him.  So, Mrs. Lady, you would have to accept that I immediately sheeped a wagon on my scum partner in order to either bus them out or distance myself from them.  If the timing of all this sits well with you as something a scum team would do, then by all means continue to vote me.  <br>\n<br>\nNow I'm done defending myself.  <br>\n<br>\nThere will be another post to follow shortly, though I need to do a little more rereading first.<br>\n<br>\nBUT, welcome to the game.

Alternatively, if you try and scum read them for doing exactly that, they can claim you have cognitive dissonance and likely get away scot free. <br>\n<br>\n2) When you explain town reads, you are encouraging discussion about them. This kind of discussion leads to the ability for scum to provide free content. (For example, if I explained my town read on aptil, it would give the scum the potential to discuss my read/case without opening themselves up.)<br>\n <br>\n3) If you discuss your town read on someone, it lowers your ability to push them for reactions later in the game.

I've asked you for something fairly straightforward: explain how your ideal Day 1 would transpire.  What characterizes intelligent town play at the start of the game when we have no information?  You make very strong claims about the stupidity of everyone else's approach, yet I am still awaiting a semi-articulate thought from you regarding this important question of mafia theory.  Do you actually have any insights to share, or is it all bluster and pomp with you?  Reading your posts, I don't see a calm, collected, intelligent individual who is dishing out badly needed lessons to the throng.  I see a cocky 14 - 19 year old who fancies himself a budding young intellectual in the making, but who as a result of some severe, latent personal insecurity, feels the need to roleplay online as a cocksure, dominant, take-no-shit type, except you have neither the writing chops nor the critical awareness to pull it off, so instead you spam schoolyard cliches (\"don't piss in my wheaties and call it milk.\"  ooh.  you really told him) in a flailing attempt to establish your psychical superiority over those who have asked you reasonable questions and are quickly growing bored of your antics.  I hate it to break it to you, but we are not impressed with your affected self-assurance, and you have not actually done anything to demonstrate your maturity or your intelligence.  Your posts are weak, your contribution is non-existent, and your schtick is transparent as air. <br>\n<br>\nFrom where I'm sitting, it looks like you have two options.<br>\n<br>\n1) You can try to call my bluff and push the pedal to the floor.  Ooh yeah, you're the man.  After all, if you just commit completely enough we're bound to realize that we're all \"village idiots\" and that you really are Anu and Enlil's gift to mafia.  Go ahead, write that snarky, dismissive response to this post.  I'm excited to see what new insults you can come up with, and I'll miss you after your lynch.  <br>\n<br>\n2) You can recognize that some of the things you are being asked to do are not insane, and that it is in fact <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">your</div> pride that has lead to the dialogue deteriorating this far.  Nobody in this town knows your alignment; it is <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">you</div> who are being rude if you refuse to answer simple questions for no clear reason, and <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">you</div> who has his head up his ass (\"God's special little snowflake\") if you get indignant when people fail to prostrate themselves before you while demanding answers.  You can take a step back, make a face-saving post, and then start playing like someone who is actually more interested in winning the game for the town than in having their ego stroked.  I strongly recommend this option.<br>\n<br>\nHere, I have <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dexIA_OfLzg\" class=\"postlink\">something which will help</a>.  It is a gorgeous and humorous video about the virtue of humility.  Watch it, rethink your life some, and then show us what you're really made of.</div></blockquote>\n\n<br>\nThis post I find interesting. Does anyone else feel like this in fact describes archaebob's life recently, or within a coupons years ago?  What are you, 22? 23? You've painted a very believable picture, either making you enormously honest in this one post or a brilliant method actor. Even if this post is a reflection of the former, I would say it reveals a lot of introspection and intelligence. Now, how would this person go about playing scum? He has gone so far as to write articles on pro-town behavior, so scum archaebob is already committed to high levels of activity and reason, more so than is town archaebob. <br>\n<br>\nSo here is my key question to the town. Does it feel to anyone else like this whole game is some kind of theory experiment? 90% of his posting is dedicated to explaining pro-town behavior or appealing to our sense of it. For someone legitimately trying to catch scum in the near future he is extremely wrapped up in having nice orderly, pro-town wagons moving wherever they ought to go. <br>\n<br>\n@archaebob: You're certainly a brilliant actor, but I still feel like I'm watching a performance. <br>\n<br>\n@Albert: You have played with archaebob before, what is your opinion?", "time": "Sat Aug 31, 2013 10:30 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=30991&start=650", "forum": "53", "thread": "30991"}

{"number": 663, "id": "5279028", "user": "archaebob", "user_id": "12231", "content": "This is my first game in over a year.  I used to come into Day 1 as an instigator, never as deliberately rude as Wake, but similarly convinced that the key to generating content was to elicit emotional reactions from people.  I was very quick to believe that I had uncovered all of the scum in the first 25 pages of a game, and was more than happy to browbeat the town into following my lead.  They often did.  We often lost.  I was almost always unlynchable and high up on people's town lists, but I was also frequently wrong, and my play was very polarizing to the games I was in.  For these reasons, my town record is actually pretty bad.<br>\n<br>\nI've returned to mafia after a turbulent year of heartbreak and epiphany to see if I am now equipped to break into that top tier of play.  There's aspects of my old town meta that I've identified as egocentric in their motivation, and that I'm persuaded I can do without.  I've read over Vi's guide a lot.  I'm fascinated by the quietness of Albert's new meta (my guess is that his arc as a player is not too different from mine).  What you've seen has been my attempt to reconcile all of these different considerations with what I still think are important priorities Day 1.<br>\n<br>\nYou can make fun of me for being a hopeless, sophomoric romantic all you want, but let's get real here, who are you kidding?  You've got a penchant for graffiti art, pokemon, and quirky usernames.  Your interest in mafia is overtly psychological and literary. \"Method acting\" is in your active vocabulary.  You're fascinated by people and their veneers, and you've singled me out because you think I have one and you want to be the person to tear it down.  You've noted that my beat down of Wake can be read as an open letter to myself.  I suspect this charade you're playing with me follows a similar principle.<br>\n<br>\nSo let's cut the BS.  You don't have a case, except to suggest that I'm enough of a genius to be pulling things off as scum.  You've correctly ascertained (look at you go) that by a hairline my play is self-conscious, and you've decided to dedicate your focus to provoking that one little sliver of my psyche.  This is a task which despite your alignment you can pursue organically because you genuinely believe you're onto something and you think it'll probably read that way.  After all, this is why you play mafia, to use your unique command of empathy to make the case that nobody else is equipped to make.  Right now, it enables you to plausibly tunnelvision, because after all, if I'm actually scum and you are the only person who is sufficiently artsy to realize it, you've gotta act <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">now</div> before you get lynched or night killed.  You can sell that to the town and it's not an explicitly inconsistent narrative.<br>\n<br>\nThe truth, Banksys, as I'm afraid we both know, is that <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">you're</div> scum.  You're deliberately picking on someone whose position in the town is secure, not so much as a scum maneuver to dislodge him, but more because it's an <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=1875705#p1875705\" class=\"postlink\">edgy and confident thing to do</a>.  And after a train wreck Day 1 in which most people here have (despite your efforts to <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5262044#p5262044\" class=\"postlink\">simulate spontaneity</a>) developed scum gut reads on you, going after me is your best bet to active lurk away the end of the day.  You really expect us to believe that in the mind of town-Banksys, <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">archaebob</div> is the best lynch today?

I'm not wrong. <br>\n<br>\nBut look, you're right, I don't know you.  Only so much comes through from the thread.  Also, I'll have difficulty eluding simplistic stereotypes with anything that I say about you.  Words are at best a coarse-grained approximation, blah blah blah.  But that's the whole game isn't it?  I have to try and figure you out and guess what you're up to from the limited info I can gather from the thread. I have to put together a picture of who you are as a person, so I can deduce your alignment from your behavior.<br>\n<br>\nAnd while I don't doubt you find my confidence smarmy and infuriating, I wager in this case that I'm not far off the mark.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Banksys wrote:</cite>  <br>\nAnd yes, archaebob, I do think we should lynch you, however, I demonstrated in my very first post a willingness to lynch someone other than my first preference.

Archaebob is aggressively pro-town, is calm and collected, and directs the town in ways that are hardly questionable in their validity.  Scumhunting such a person is extremely difficult, so I did several things to test out how he would react.  I joined his NicCage wagon and cited his article (which was actually pretty good) to see how he would warm up to buddying.  Then he asked me about my origins in mafia directly, so I decided to not give him a straight answer and force him to chase me.  I wanted to see how far his pro-town thing would go, and if he really kept it up I wanted to get a feel for how genuine it was or if I thought it was an act.  Then I unvoted NicCage right after archaebob unvoted him to see if archaebob would vote NicCage again.  He didn't, and while I'm less convinced of his towniness than some others have said or implied, I don't have anywhere further to go with that line of inquiry, at least not yet.  <br>\n<br>\nThird I just got off a House of Cards kick and I wanted to show up all badass sounding like Francis Underwood, so that act screwed me.</div></blockquote>\n\n\"That act screwed me.\"<br>\n<br>\nThat act <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">screwed</div> me.

What you <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">will</div> see a lot in smart scum is a stitched-together quality in their thought process and reactions.  They write things for effect.  What they do doesn't line up with what they say.  Or it lines up <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">completely</div>, in a kind of preplanned way.  Also, what they say doesn't line up with how they're saying it.  It's a subtle thing, and it's really just a question of putting yourself in their shoes, trying to imagine yourself with their personality, and seeing whether what they're doing lines up more with what you'd expect from town or scum.  In the case of Banksys, I see scum all over, because I'm constantly reminded of things I've done or felt tempted to do as scum.  I feel it on my skin.  <br>\n<br>\nI'm really not sure about LadyL.  Yeah, she doesn't explain stuff, which comes with certain advantages and disadvantages for town.  Among the disadvantages of playing that way is that if for whatever reason you start to trigger scum gut reads you're in a poor position to defend yourself.  At the moment I'm inclined to think that she's town, because her reads largely agree with mine.  I also don't think that flying off the handle is a scum tell.  At all.  So, while I understand some of the motivation behind the wagon, I don't think she's the best Day 1 lynch. <br>\n<br>\nI don't buy any of Nacho's reasoning, especially since he hasn't answered my question about his initial Banksys vote.", "time": "Fri Sep 06, 2013 2:27 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=30991&start=825", "forum": "53", "thread": "30991"}

This is the epitome of successful lurking.  No wonder he offered no real opinion on the final wagons of D-1, he wasn't around for them.  not only are his posts infrequent at best, they are largely devoid of content. <br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>hodge wrote:</cite>Some quick notes<br>\n<br>\nAs people have asked, my vote this is the first game i've been involved with out of the road to rome and all of that had RVS, I admit I assumed it was similar here.<br>\n<br>\nWake, I'm getting a feeling of while contributing some information and ideas there is a fair deal of avoidance tactics and smoke screening so that people are unsure on whether to vote or not. Also what if there is no tracker it would mean no counter claim anyway?<br>\n<br>\nOn Squilly, the varying votes and lack of information, doesn't appear great but attracts a level of suspicion that wouldn't be wise as scum.</div></blockquote>\n\nThis is hodge's first post in the game with actual content, and you'll notice it is post-Wake claim.  This is classic waffly reading that can be easily cited or changed later. <br>\n<br>\nSecond he calls out Squilly for what he will continue to do for the entire day.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>hodge wrote:</cite>Think NicCage is fine for now, I don't see any real hard evidence of scummy behaviour, but keeping him at null for now.<br>\n<br>\nBecause of the way they have acted so far<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">VOTE: Squilly</div></div></blockquote>\n\nThis is post number 4.  Here he drops his first vote and first \"reads.\"  This is hardly \"hard evidence\" to use his words. <br>\n<br>\narchaebob calls him out for it in 303.<br>\n<br>\nHodge is then absent for some time and ignores questions until antihero pseudo-screams at him.  <br>\n<br>\nArchaebob starts going after him for this, so he defends himself with this:<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>hodge wrote:</cite>I admit I haven't posted regularly enough, today I would have but have had some laptop issues which I think i've solved.<br>\n<br>\nHowever, I want to ask why you want to sheep someone who most people have at null (even if its because of a lack of evidence) then getting a bandwagon on someone who more people suspect. We have 2 people with a fair amount of votes on, what would be the reasoning for moving a good amount of votes onto someone else and being in the same position? Have we really got everything we can from where the votes are atm?</div></blockquote>\n\nHe is disavowing the legitimacy of any and all lurker wagons in favor of major wagons only.  You'll notice he is conceptually defending his lurking while refusing to admit that he is doing it.  His only actual defense is varying excuses for lack of content, each time promising more.  <br>\n<br>\nThe kicker:  He LITERALLY NEVER changed his vote throughout all of D-1 after the RVS.  That's absurd.  Why has no one else called him out for this?

Rampage", "user_id": "6983", "content": "I felt like Banksys' non sequiturs with archaebob were scummy, and that she was very misleading at several points in the day. That being said, she definitely stumbled down the scummy ladder after last night. I feel like my main concerns with her are her long contrived posts and the LLD vote with horrible reasoning. What I found when I looked back at that interaction during the night, is that I could partially see how a pressure vote for information could have quickly turned into a real one considering how LLD was so tunnelvisioned. If someone wants you dead and their alignment is unknown to you, and one of you is getting lynched, would you be voting them as your counterwagon? You bet. <br>\n<br>\nThe other thing is the archaebob kill. Archaebob may have correctly identified the entire scumteam yesterday and was killed because he posed a larger threat than any PR. Or maybe once the scum kill the real PRs, they realize that the PR fakeclaiming scum will quickly be exposed. In any case, there's no way that Banksys' actions yesterday and today outweigh the scummy quickhammer or the lack of movement from NicCage's corner after the wrong vote count. It's simply not something that he could miss. Every time there's a vote count, you instinctively verify if your vote is placed correctly. He even posted after that vote count. He either didn't see the thread, or I think, read it and didn't mention a thing in twilight when we thought that LLD was dead. And there was an entire day left before the deadline when LLD was hammered. Assuming that Antihero is the cop, the scum had to get rid of the doctor during the day or that would set them back 2 investigations, plus a suicide run if there's a watcher targeting Antihero. <br>\n<br>\nAnother one, Hodge had his vote on LLD all day yesterday, refused to unvote when I called him out on it a couple days away before the deadline, on account of pressure, and sat there right up until the hammer. Out of all the players, I'm also careful about Nacho. I think that he's dangerous. He's good at directing the town and influencing votes. Aside from Antihero, who I'm willing to believe due to Viera, Uctitron may be the only player I'm not afraid of at this point.", "time": "Thu Sep 12, 2013 5:09 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=30991&start=975", "forum": "53", "thread": "30991"}

Rampage, StrangerCoug, Ulctriton, Aptil.  <br>\n<br>\nGiven that this is the case, I obviously feel that Aptil and Ulctriton are the last scum.  Aptil has clung to the shadows throughout this game.  He has never had a major wagon on him, nor has he led one.  He has active lurked his way all the way to the present.  Even now, when asked for a case, you go for the much easier insistence that StrangerCouf reread, cuz who could argue with that?  Of course we should all be rereading, so townie points for you without you having to say anything.  I think the pattern is pretty clear.  <br>\n<br>\nSecondly, Ulctriton has hammered (or declared intent to hammer) on a few townies.  He did not post significant content on these people, he simply was the one to pull the trigger.  Normally I'd say that was a bold move for scum, but the WIFOM of it could make that his strategy all by itself.  He certainly would not be the first scum willing to get his hands dirty, and his actions have not only failed to generate discussion, they have quite literally stopped it.  <br>\n<br>\nTherefore I must vote Aptil or Ulctriton.  I am willing to wait to vote either of these people, but in Aptil's case there is little point.  If he and I are both townies then we've already lost.  If he is scum, then his buddy isn't going to contribute to his quick lynch.  <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: Aptil</div>", "time": "Sun Sep 29, 2013 3:14 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=30991&start=1125", "forum": "53", "thread": "30991"}

That being said, she definitely stumbled down the scummy ladder after last night. I feel like my main concerns with her are her long contrived posts and the LLD vote with horrible reasoning. What I found when I looked back at that interaction during the night, is that I could partially see how a pressure vote for information could have quickly turned into a real one considering how LLD was so tunnelvisioned. If someone wants you dead and their alignment is unknown to you, and one of you is getting lynched, would you be voting them as your counterwagon? You bet. <br>\n<br>\nThe other thing is the archaebob kill. Archaebob may have correctly identified the entire scumteam yesterday and was killed because he posed a larger threat than any PR. Or maybe once the scum kill the real PRs, they realize that the PR fakeclaiming scum will quickly be exposed. In any case, there's no way that Banksys' actions yesterday and today outweigh the scummy quickhammer or the lack of movement from NicCage's corner after the wrong vote count. It's simply not something that he could miss. Every time there's a vote count, you instinctively verify if your vote is placed correctly. He even posted after that vote count. He either didn't see the thread, or I think, read it and didn't mention a thing in twilight when we thought that LLD was dead. And there was an entire day left before the deadline when LLD was hammered. Assuming that Antihero is the cop, the scum had to get rid of the doctor during the day or that would set them back 2 investigations, plus a suicide run if there's a watcher targeting Antihero. <br>\n<br>\nAnother one, Hodge had his vote on LLD all day yesterday, refused to unvote when I called him out on it a couple days away before the deadline, on account of pressure, and sat there right up until the hammer.

Rampage, StrangerCoug, Ulctriton, Aptil.  <br>\n<br>\nGiven that this is the case, I obviously feel that Aptil and Ulctriton are the last scum.  Aptil has clung to the shadows throughout this game.  He has never had a major wagon on him, nor has he led one.  He has active lurked his way all the way to the present.  Even now, when asked for a case, you go for the much easier insistence that StrangerCouf reread, cuz who could argue with that?  Of course we should all be rereading, so townie points for you without you having to say anything.  I think the pattern is pretty clear.  <br>\n<br>\nSecondly, Ulctriton has hammered (or declared intent to hammer) on a few townies.  He did not post significant content on these people, he simply was the one to pull the trigger.  Normally I'd say that was a bold move for scum, but the WIFOM of it could make that his strategy all by itself.  He certainly would not be the first scum willing to get his hands dirty, and his actions have not only failed to generate discussion, they have quite literally stopped it.  <br>\n<br>\nTherefore I must vote Aptil or Ulctriton.  I am willing to wait to vote either of these people, but in Aptil's case there is little point.  If he and I are both townies then we've already lost.  If he is scum, then his buddy isn't going to contribute to his quick lynch.  <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: Aptil</div></div></blockquote>\nPlease show me posts where StrangerCoug has posted content.

Instead of going after the claimed cop though, the scum employ a strategy to kill archeabob instead. If I remember correctly they were looking for a SK or other PR, and were risking letting the cop live. Whatever the reason, it really worked for them because the first thing archeabob says when he gets into the dead thread is:<br>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Banksys<br>\nSalmonella<br>\nand then either Rampage(Godfather/SK) or Nachomamma<br>\n<br>\namirite?</div></blockquote>\n\nScum kill the guy who had them pegged. At the same time, Antihero investigates ABR, leading to ABR being pronounced town by the cop. This works very well for the scum who can now kill the cop the next night, knowing there is nothing more they can gain from him. SD's proclamation that VA killed Antihero ends up being perfectly timed because even though SD was going to do it anyway, VA had actually tracked SD to Antihero and knew the truth. Instead of SD being the easy lynch, he turns it around and gets town to lynch their last PR. It was a suicide move, but it worked the best way it could have.<br>\n<br>\nThanks to all the players for sticking with the game, I appreciate you all being apart of my first mod experience.
