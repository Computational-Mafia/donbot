I can try providing an update.<br>\n<br>\nI'm voting Cybertronix for reasons already mentioned.<br>\n<br>\ndrmyshotgun is null or slightly scummy but that's over minor things such as joining wagons without elaborating on his reasons and being a bit too triggerhappy in my own personal opinion. I think these are minor things because I think he's being a bit lazy due to having played with people here before. Also, post 183 seemed pro-town to me and I think it is unlikely that he'd do it if both of him and mala are scum.<br>\n<br>\nExamples of laziness:<br>\nPost 81<br>\nPost 101<br>\n<br>\nDemon Core I read as pro-town. Firstly, he's been active throughout the game instead of, for instance, being selectively active only when it benefits his hidden agenda. Secondly, he is noticing things that would be likely to go unnoticed by players faking activity, like post 185 and post 269.<br>\n<br>\nThe most important thing I can think of regarding Slandaar is that I consider his alignment tied to that of Benmage such that, should one of them flip scum, the other is unlikely to scum as well. However, I find it perfectly plausible that neither of them are scum. I kind of hate post 220 but I think that's the being-in-a-game-with-known-people laziness speaking.<br>\n<br>\nBub Bidderskins is preoccupied with deploring the content of my posts instead of improving on his own. I speak for the most part only when I get asked a question or when I have something I find important to say. I was wondering about his post 166 but figured that anyone making such statement would have mentioned their reasons if they were solid.<br>\n<br>\nI've already talked some about Mala and don't think I have anything important to add.<br>\n<br>\nI don't know about Method.<br>\n<br>\nI don't really know about charter either, but I've noticed that he sometimes exaggerates so I have to adjust accordingly when reading his posts.<br>\n<br>\nI've commented on Benmage previously in the game and a bit above as well.

Bub is sort of a backburner suspicion in case I'm wrong about Ben, but for now, I feel decent about him.

I expect my obstinate behaviors to strengthen suspicions (see: charter), not make them disappear completely with no comment, no anything. Also the Mala vote was opportunistic as all hell and made me want to burn him with a passion, but unfortunately he's gone now and I'll have to dance with Rainbowdash. I'm holding off on commenting on charter until he responds to my latest post, actually.

{"number": 461, "id": "4461899", "user": "Lord Voldemort", "user_id": "20159", "content": "None of you seem to be paying attention to the things you need to be paying attention to. Fortunately I'm here to remind everyone that Slandaar<sup>1</sup> caught scum on page two. If you'll recall, Bub<sup>2</sup> tried to remind you folks of that, but that was derailed once everyone became too busy trying to lynch an unchallenged<sup>3</sup> jailkeeper on D1.<br>\n<br>\nI'll start off at the beginning for thoroughgoing's sake, but I don't have the time to put ~four hours into this post like I'd normally do under equivalent circumstances. For those of you following along at home, we'll start on page 2.<br>\n<br>\nSlandaar makes an obvious RVS-exiting-\"gambit\"-post and Benmage bites, or decides to sheep Bub's vote to wagon. One or the other, it makes little difference. Naturally, Slandaar follows that up by voting for Ben. At this point we're just on your typical post-RVS wagon based on unconvincing reasoning that wouldn't hold up if it wasn't page 2. And then Ben starts being defensive and flailing immediately.<br>\n<br>\nRight off the bat he's super serious about it in post #32 before clearly becoming overly defensive in #42/#43. There's no need to make a point-by-point tear-down of a weak RVS wagon. Post <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4424507#p4424507\" class=\"postlink\">#63</a> is pretty astounding in and of itself, not to mention the fallacies applied within it. You'll notice he's not scumhunting at all either, he's focused completely on defending himself against the flimsiest pressure. I'm going to state this plainly so no one misses my point: This isn't how a town-aligned player reacts here. At all. Moving on, we have a ridiculous wall in post #96. He's still attempting to tear this RVS case against him apart bit by bit. Posts #112-114 are another series of rapid-fire self-interested defensive posts. Trying to sling mud onto Bub in post #116. Still entirely focused on players attacking him.<br>\n<br>\nIn post #181 he points out that someone else did something he's been accused of, I guess this is meant to be a defense somehow. A scummy defense. It's around this time that he conveniently lacks the free time necessary to really devote time to the game properly and his early-game wagon fizzles out. Instead he chooses to dedicate half of his posts on the page to things not related to in-game happenings(the conviction hydra and whatnot). I'd like to bring attention to his continued use of things such as \"you should know better\"/\"Maybe you just think that because you're new\"/\"I'm experienced\"/\"My scum game is flawless\" and similar garbage as a defensive tactic. This is complete bullshit and I can't believe no one called him out on it the entire time. There are at least six or so instances of this happening, and even more of him trying to use the \"I'm right because I am, your logic is bad\" argument.<br>\n<br>\nHis power goes out after this, which is unfortunate as I'm sure he would have buried himself even more deeply. As it stands though his entire contribution to the game was an exercise in flailing and spewing fallaciousness around in an attempt to not get lynched and bully people into backing off of his wagon.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">vote: Benmage</div><br>\n<br>\nI can tell my time crunch really wreaked havoc on my organization and writing style.

I was one townfactionCop.  The other faction cop had been killed.  When I claimed my results, I added a guilty on Nero Cain.  It was near endgame, and Nero Cain for some idiotic reason still had me as his #1/#2 scum suspect, not believing that I was the townsCop for the other faction, when we had flips of two scum teams, and one dead factional cop already....  Clearly an endgame hazard.  After his hammering, during twilight I told the true result.  NC was town, but I do not regret his lynching, as he was endgame detrimental.  Moreover the true results, led too favorable town PoE and a town win.<br>\n<br>\nLast but not least:<br>\n<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=56&amp;t=14592\" class=\"postlink\">CEB Mafia (dramonic)</a><br>\nA bit of an older game.  This was my first introduction to Fate and the Spam Locks Douchebags.  They were spamming the thread so over the top with nothingness that half the game was incapable of playing.  30 pages of this nonsense and I had enough.  So I faked I think a daycop maybe on Fate, as a guilty.  It ended the useless banter, and I again rescinded this claim confirmed Fate as town, and lynched scum.<br>\n<br>\nThats the extent of my gambits.  No such risky maneuvers with scum.  No need to really with scum imo.  My scum game is flawlessly amazing.  I have zero need to pull a high risk high reward gambit as something absurd like faking a guilty on my partner on D2 whose a mafia cop with zero suspicion on his slot, and next to nothing on my slot.<br>\n<br>\nBack to how I caught LV, is again back to the benmagetell, or confirmation bias.  Charter is saying how did I know he was scum when I said nothing of his slot.  Well I caught him with his one obvious post where he votes me, where he respins all my actions into the negative light, without entertaining a town perspective.  Thats what scum must do.  As scum must force mislynches.  They take actions and spin them only one way.  I first used this tell with much success catching Magister Ludi scum in Patricks Speed Mafia.  Its a tell best used when someone is spinning information negatively against oneself.  But I also caught, and dayvigged Reck in Weather Mafia II because Reck was spinning one persons statements to such absurd negativity and was refusing to acknowledge town perspectives.  It is a more advanced tell to recognize, but I have had a lot of success with it.
