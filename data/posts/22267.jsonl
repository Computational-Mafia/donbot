You may request a deadline extension, but it is up to my final decision whether or not I grant the extension based on what I've seen. There will not be a lynch if the game goes to night due to this deadline--someone has to consciously place a hammer vote.<br>    </li><li>You may choose to go to night without a lynch before then, by having at least half of the players vote: No Lynch. (That's half, not a full majority.)<br>    </li><li>Votes should be posted in the format 'vote: Barack Obama.' I expect them to be entirely bold, but don't try to exploit this to trick someone. I'll count what I damn well want to count. I will register misspellings and nicknames if I can figure out who you're referring to. You do not have to unvote, but you're welcome to do so anyway.<br>    </li><li>When a player has the majority of the votes at a single point, they are dead and the game goes to twilight. You may post in twilight until I get a lynch scene up.<br>    </li><li>Night deadlines are usually going to be 72-hours, or whenever I receive all actions. If you have a role but don't want to perform a night action, just PM me with the phrase No Night Action so I know you've made your choice.<br>    </li><li>If any anti-town faction does not submit a kill at night, they will no kill and the day phase will continue.</li></ul><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"font-size: 120%; line-height: 116%;\">\u2028\u2028What is and isn't allowed:</span></span><br><ul>    <li>Unless otherwise specified, living players can't communicate with each other out of the thread. I will set up a QuickTopic for anyone who is able to communicate with someone else.<br>    </li><li>You may rant to both dead players and nonplaying friends, although you're encouraged to first make sure that said friends aren't interested in replacing in with you. (I am of course available, sympathetic and discrete.) Regardless of where you found them, rantbuddies may not reveal their own opinions on the game.<br>    </li><li>\"Dead\" means \"dead.\" You can have one \"Bah! I'm dead! Go town!\" post afterwards, but if it contains any game relevant information, I will delete it, bring you back from the dead, and modkill you just to prove a point.<br>    </li><li>Read your role PM and summarize it in your confirmation PM response to me. Unless I've posted it publicly, you may not reference its wording in-thread. You can paraphrase if you must claim, but any direct quotation of any PMs will result in a modkill. If you are unsure of whether you can say something or not, PM me and ask.<br>    </li><li>Green font and area tags are my domain. Don't use them. Don't pretend to use them.<br>    </li><li>You may only type in default font, italics, bold, underline, etc. Do not increase or decrease default font size, do not change font colors, etc.</li></ul><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"font-size: 120%; line-height: 116%;\">\u2028\u2028What to expect from me:</span></span><br><ul>    <li>Do try to be active, and leave a notification in-thread and/or by PM if that's not possible. I will automatically prod anyone who has not posted in over 48 hours. I will make all prods public in the thread.<br>    </li><li>If you don't post in-thread in response to a prod within 24 hours, I will seek a replacement to take over your role. I may seek replacement for a player who lurks consistently without breaking this rule, but you'll have some sort of warning first.<br>    </li><li>If you receive three prods in a row without much contribution to the game, you will automatically be replaced.<br>    </li><li>I'll try to post votecounts regularly. If you feel it has been too long since the last one, request one. If I make errors, please correct me.<br>    </li><li>I'm one of those \"spirit-of-the-game\"-type hippies. This ruleset is a guideline. I reserve the right to change it at will, and even in extreme circumstances enforce it retroactively. If a strategy feels shady to you, you might want to take it up with me first.</li></ul><span style=\"font-size: 20%; line-height: 116%;\">Thanks to Ether for letting me steal her ruleset.</span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">A sample Vanilla Townie role PM reads as follows:</span><br><fieldset style=\"border:3px outset grey; padding:5px 10px\"><legend style=\"text-transform:uppercase; margin:0px 0.6em; padding:0em 0.33em\">Townie</legend>Hello, and welcome to Mini 1343: The Death of Papa Zito!

By dubbing, I assume you are talking about English dubbing over the original Japanese, in which case I would respond that it's not a characteristic of anime (but American broadcasts of anime) and you shouldn't be watching it in English in most cases. About the writing... you can criticize the writing in pretty much any work in the world right now.

Feel free to take it as backtracking, but along with the sarcasm earlier, d'you think I'm so idiotic that I would start a counterwagon on Oman when the only evidence I can back it up with is that he's lurking? He has one post in the RVS stage for evidence for how he's scum. ^^<br>I really think you guys are looking a bit too much in depth into that word, but feel free to pin it on me if he does turn up as scum as a Freudian slip -- I'll deal with it by choosing my words more carefully next time if y'all are picky."}

He's been stating over and over again that Kage and Pine are scum together, even when the post doesn't add new information to the case.  I feel like this could be a playstyle thing, but it's worth noting, as trying to muscle through a lynch like this is suspicious.</div></blockquote><br><br>Not bothering you enough for a vote?

Amrun just said before that she has her own place on both wagons, she started both the cases on the leading wagons. It's not 'convenient', it's truth. Casually tossing in the timely switch in there is more shit, too, since Amrun just clearly and harshly pointed that the deadline is rather soon. So we begin with some Scott-shit.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4124011#p4124011\" class=\"postlink\">post 214</a>, Scott Brosius wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4123900#p4123900\" class=\"postlink\">post 207</a>, Amrun wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4123722#p4123722\" class=\"postlink\">post 204</a>, Giitah wrote:</cite>Actually, now that I reflect on it, Amrun hasn't provided adequate reasoning for her sudden switch. Pray tell, what has Scott done that caused you to switch, Amrun?</div></blockquote><br><br>No offense... but are you dense?  Have you read the deadline?  Have you read any of my posts all game?  Did you see that roflcopter unvoted, making the wagons uneven and making Scott more viable than KageLord?  Did you see that I *gasp* BLATANTLY SAID THAT?<br><br>Scott, you just made me feel better about my deadline compromise - thanks.<br><br>But it's one of the easiest deadline compromise I've ever made.  You're just scrambling to throw shit on anyone you possibly you can.  You do realize that I literally started the wagons on BOTH of you, right, Scott?  So how exactly am I wishy-washy?  I've had exactly three scum reads all game: you, KageLord, and Giitah, and I withdrew my more minor FoS on Giitah and like her as town.<br><br>I wasn't the first vote on your wagon, Scott, but I was the first to voice suspicion of you, and Pine, the first vote on your wagon, was sheeping ME.  My first suspicion of you came BEFORE your bad vote on the KageLord wagon; I haven't like you since RVS, in fact, when you failed to vote until I reminded you.  Then, I really disliked how you just commented on the fluff and not on the content, at which point I voiced my suspicion of you.  And then you made a really hypocritical vote on KageLord that I called you out on.  Your main and best point on KageLord was his pre-emptive associative tells, but several other people had committed the same thing BEFORE your vote and THEN roflcopter after your vote, and none of these people were worthy of a mention or of your suspicion - only KageLord, after I got the wagon going on him.<br><br>Then again, KageLord's entrance to YOUR wagon was just as survivalistic.  At least one of you two are scum, and I'd bet my life on it.  I lean towards Kage as the scummiest of the pair, but you are scum lord #2, and you trying to paint me as opportunistic (over someone like roflcopter, for example) is just laughable when I created dueling wagons on my suspects out of thin air.  I can vote on either wagon because I made that shit happen.</div></blockquote><br><br>I forgot to include a vote then posted in the same minute as you with a vote. Go ahead and think you \"reminded\" me. That's scummy? That is laughable. Grasp at more straws please. <br><br>Can you show me where you had the early suspicion on me due to this pathetic tell? Or did you just conveniently bring it up an hour ago? <br><br>The main point was not the associative tells. To act like that was the only part of my case is a huge misrep. The main point was the meek asking if anyone wanted to pressure kdowns. That is completely scummy, testing the climate to see if that lynch was viable. As i have said ad nauseum, useless associations are not a strong enough tell on its own, but adds to a case. I didn't see anything scummy from you otherwise so I let it be. <br><br>Don't knock yourself over with how hard you are patting yourself on the back.</div></blockquote><br><br>I've found the apparently 'pathetic tell' Amrun was referring to, you've obviously taken your time to look over her case. Your use of words also amuses me: we've done a kanye-Pine twist again!

Okay, so we have iamusername scrapping by on the wagon, and we have Pine and I on board. Of the three of us, which one are you suggesting is scummy? KageLord opportunistically jumped on less than a day ago so we can count him out too. Iamusername is obviously scummy. Pine looks fine. and if I'm not mistaken you have me written down as a town read. Who are you insinuating is the scummy perpetrator on the wagon? I for one believe Pine might have been picking up on the same gut feeling I had -- Scott being wishy-washy with his words.

A town move, but commonly used by scum to get townpoints while not providing anything new for themselves so it is null to me.<br>ISO 24 \u2013 Switches onto Scott wagon because mine has lost steam and Scott seems more viable. Again, a town or scum move. Town motivation is to get a still good lynch by deadline. Scum motivation if Scott is town is to push along a different mislynch. Scum motivation if Scott is also scum is to get a bus in during that crucial interval between \u201cnew wagon emerging\u201d and \u201csure lynch\u201d.<br>ISO 25-33 \u2013 Defends switching onto Scott.<br>ISO 34 \u2013 Doesn\u2019t believe Scott\u2019s claim, but back to me as his claim will work itself out.<br>ISO 35 \u2013 Not that opposed to kdowns lynch, but doesn\u2019t want to leave actual suspect for lurker.<br>Overall \u2013 I got on the Amrun wagon because it seemed like the best start to getting out of RVS and I didn\u2019t like the way she defended herself. The quick turn on me (and the lie to defend her earlier statement) obviously didn\u2019t help my opinion of her. The rest of the day is harder to read because her moves could have either town or scum motivation. I also give her slight scumpoints for how strongly she is going after me, since she would know it\u2019s an easy mislynch and it stops it from looking like she\u2019s backtracking. My read is leaning scum.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">FightingShadow:</span></span><br><br>ISO 2 \u2013 Jumps on Amrun wagon.<br>ISO 3 \u2013 Strong fencesitting on iamausername\u2019s point about Pine. Very slight digs at Pine and me, setting up possible jumps onto a wagon on either of us. Votes kdowns (presumably because kdowns didn\u2019t explain his vote).<br>ISO 7 \u2013 Puts another foot in toward my wagon, but says he doesn\u2019t want to allow a hammer this early. Scum motivation here is obviously that he doesn\u2019t want to be near the end of my wagon if I\u2019m about to be mislynched.<br>ISO 9 \u2013 Gives a point against kdowns to explain his vote and reluctance to join my wagon, but says he\u2019d get rid of me before deadline. Again, easy way for scum to get on my wagon while avoiding some suspicion, but also a decent enough reason from town. If not for the last thing, I would say this was null, but\u2026 it strikes me as odd now.<br>Overall \u2013 I could understand his comment about being willing to push my wagon through at deadline if that was it, but the fact that he kept taking small steps toward my wagon (possibly laying the seeds for eventually joining my wagon or just trying to avoid leaving a footprint on it while still not making waves) while pushing others and continues to do so D2 is rubbing me the wrong way.

Mostly it was jumping on wagons without reason. However, I have a good gut feeling that he is town.

Clearly looks like he is trying to avoid saying anything new (and possibly damaging to himself) while still pushing my wagon. Major scumpoints.<br>ISO 9-15 \u2013 Insists Pine and I are scumbuddies. No further comments.<br>ISO 19 \u2013 Pushes for \u201cdeadline\u201d lynch of kdowns.<br>ISO 21 \u2013 Accepts Scott\u2019s claim for now.<br>ISO 22 \u2013 Really wants kdowns lynch.<br>Overall \u2013 If I had seen his ISO 8 before, I would have definitely pushed for his lynch earlier.

Note that he doesn\u2019t mention the at least two other relation posts here. Suspicious of FightingShadow\u2019s jump onto the Amrun wagon. Votes me for the whole kdowns policy pressure deal.<br>ISO 5 \u2013 When asked about the other relation posts, he says it\u2019s not a strong enough tell on its own. Apparently it doesn\u2019t matter how often it is done either (see: roflcopter). This sounds close to backtracking to me, but I may be biased.<br>ISO 9 \u2013 When asked about roflcopter, he disapproves of tunneling and relation tells but says he is a secondary scumread with FightingShadow (surprising considering how much more of that stuff rofl has done).<br>ISO 10 \u2013 Disapproves of kdowns lynch and everyone on his wagon. Feel like he wants 5 votes here so he can vote me, username, Giitah, Pine, and Amrun. Says iamausername has done absolutely nothing and is second biggest scumread. Funny how rofl and FS are suddenly gone from his sight. Judging by the tells he has used so far, rofl should easily be his second biggest read.<br>ISO 11 \u2013 During his argument with Amrun (don\u2019t know which number she is of us 7 scumspects) he says the main point against me is trying to see if kdowns was a viable lynch early on. Seems to forget/ignore that I have said ad nauseum that I did not intend for kdowns to be lynched when I said that.<br>ISO 12 \u2013 Weak Doctor claim. Didn\u2019t fully buy it then and even more dubious now that he survived N1.<br>Overall \u2013 Either he quickly forgets earlier events or he is scum. I definitely want to take out rofl first, but if he flips scum I am quickly looking at Scott next (Scott is plenty scummy on his own, but it becomes too much with a rofl scum flip). Also, looking at Giitah\u2019s death, <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4124328#p4124328\" class=\"postlink\">221</a> stands out to me.

She came up with an absolutely brilliant way of using her role-blocking ability which caused town to do a massive mislynch.  So it's very much on my mind that if the scum have a roleblocker, and Scot's claim is true, and Amrun's on the scumteam, they would have blocked Scot's ability so she gave a false positive.  This is why an answer from Scot as to whether he'd know of that is valuable.  And I hope we get it (or something from him, at least, to indicate his target) before any hammers happen.

As Kayne said (and I'm going to elaborate on), protected by the weak doctor who lived.  If she's scum, either the scum have a roleblocker, or (less likely) some way of preventing Amrun from being targeted.  A roleblocker could just continue roleblocking the weak doctor until a better choice for them came along, and with only one death last night, odds are it's exactly what it looks like -- Scott protected a townie.

I believe I mentioned that.<br><br>I'm trying to look at the big picture here. We have four lynches in which to hit two scum. The first lynch is going to Pine. If Pine flips scum, the remaining lynches should be saulres, FightingShadow and Oman.<br><br>If you disagree with any of that, you need to explain how it is remotely plausible that roflcopter, YYR or kanye are scum with Pine. If you're not going to do that, I have no interest in discussing it further.<br><br>I want to figure out the optimum choices for the three lynches that will remain if Pine flips town. So, you say FightingShadow is scum. Who else, if not Pine?<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4156780#p4156780\" class=\"postlink\">post 405</a>, roflcopter wrote:</cite>username: you're just going to have to take my word on kanye for now. i've got an incontrovertible town read on him.</div></blockquote><br><br>I'm just gonna go ahead and do some rolefishing right here cuz I'm confirmed town, so I can; if this is role-related info, I think that now would be a fine, fine time to say so. Scum already have two confirmed townies absorbing their night kills, you're not going to draw a kill by making vague allusions to fake role info, and if you have real role info, we'd be approaching the point where the game would be won already by revealing it.<br><br>Actually, that goes for everyone. If you have role info, there's no time like the present. Don't listen to the chumps who think massclaims should wait until lylo. Massclaims should happen AT LEAST a day before possible lylo, and in situations where the scum are behind (like, say, 1/3 of them are dead, while 2/7 of the town are 100% confirmed and thus completely unlynchable), they should happen even earlier.<br><br>Anyway. Back to rofl. If all you have is a strong town read on kanye, then I repeat; I'd like to hear the reasons. I trust you. I don't trust him. I have been burned before for thinking that kanye was obvtown when he wasn't town at all. If I just take your word for it now, I could be just taking your word forever, because I am not long for this world. I don't want to do that.<br><br>I know I'm probably just being paranoid, and that Pine is probably going to flip scum here. I've just lost too many games by not bothering to consider all the angles and just assuming that things will work out. I don't want to do that here. Pine is not guaranteed to flip scum. And I don't want to end this day without feeling satisfied that I've done the best I can to prepare this town for that eventuality.<br><br>So please.

I'll request replacement if it happens again or try to go with phone posting. <br><br>I did manage to reread the thread, and I did catch some things of FightingShadow that were a bit off, particularly more when I ISO'ed him. In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4104731#p4104731\" class=\"postlink\">#96</a>, he acknowledges some of the scummy vibes he's getting from some players and then votes for kdowns, as if attempting to avoid the other wagons, and his reasons for voting kdowns seem more minor in comparison. And then he parks his vote there. His case is meh, especially with other stuff going on in the thread. He admits later that he finds one of his posts suspicious, but he reluctantly didn't put KageLord at L-1, so I don't know where exactly he was headed without really pushing his read on kdowns. Seems to just be waiting for the KageLord wagon to go away. <br><br>However, the hammer on Day 2 I think isn't as suspicious as we made it out to be. He seemed to be barely keeping up with the game (evident with his Kanye vote), so I don't think he would be putting too much thought about the Weak Doc claim as either alignment. But eh, I don't object too much with his lynch. The problem is that he's a lurker really. I've been going back and forth with my read on him at work, and it's driving me crazy. His slot really should get that replacement. <br><br>Reading Oman over, I'm getting some town vibes. He jumps on the KageLord wagon while everyone else was running after Pine and Scott on Day 2. I don't think a scumbuddy would do that, especially when we theorized that scum didn't kill SCott to get a potential mislynch out of Scott (and the people on that wagon are all on the town list). Which does make me doubt our town list (Amrun, Rofl, Kanye). And it's confounded further by the fact that I can't seem to find a satisfactory scum group in the remaining players. Saulres-FS I guess is possible (and I feel like Saulres is really trying to keep his options open - more on that later), but some of their interactions seem to indicate otherwise. Dunno.<br><br>There's also some posts from Amrun and Rofl that I need to find again as well that I feel need questioning. I'll get to these tomorrow after some sleep. Also, what happened to the massclaim proposed yesterday? Didn't really see the drawback in that, so we should probably do it today. I really want to try to figure out this setup because something is bugging me that I feel I'm missing something. <br><br>Now I sleep."}

Basically, posting for the sake of looking active without providing anything of content whatsoever.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Giitah wrote:</cite>Finally, Oman's lurking scum.</div></blockquote><br>I'm glad someone pointed this out. <br><br>I can see Giitah's point about using the word \"scum\" as a means of pressure and of drawing someone out of the shadows, particularly on Day 1. I like his and Amrun's exchange, more town points for Amrun. <br><br><br>I sincerely don't like Oman's response to Giitah. It's one thing to explain where you were, but it's another to just insult the dude. You took four lines to explain where you were and then added nothing of substance, like you just came in to look for your name. I don't like it.<br><br>I also can't imagine what your working hours were like for the Queen's birthday. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>roflcopter wrote:</cite>this whole exchange is going to look especially funny once kage and pine have both flipped scum</div></blockquote><br>This sticks out to me due to the now-revealed alignment of Kage and Pine, and also the fact that rofl can't seem to comment on anything else going on. Instead, he just keeps rolling with the spam. I'm feeling like he's distancing from Kage so that when Kage does flip, he can go: \"See! See! I fucking told you guys!\"<br><br><br>I still don't like Oman, his next posts are just ones that concern him and still he adds nothing of substance and derailing into Queen's Birthday discussions.<br><br><br>I do not like rofl's entry onto the kdowns wagon in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4123307#p4123307\" class=\"postlink\">#195</a>.

You're just town-ish, more town-ish than the rest just by sheer content of replacing in.

I've been debating the idea in my head of a Amrun-Rofl team, although there's so much conflicting posts (as in I read some posts as scum and others as town) that it's been basically been scrapped. However, I find the possibility that one of them is scum much more compelling.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Rofl, what was your reasoning for having Scott protect Amrun Night 1?</span> We never really discussed that, and I'd like to know why.<br><br>The insistence of a Kage-Pine pair at the beginning of the game still reads genuine, but the reversal from Kage-scum to Kage-town on Day 2 and the persecution of Pine individually is pretty damming in retrospect. Saying he we would sheep Kanye on Scott is also suspicious, and it makes me think of lazy scum. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4138245#p4138245\" class=\"postlink\">post 308</a>, Amrun wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4137175#p4137175\" class=\"postlink\">post 306</a>, Scott Brosius wrote:</cite>If I was wrong about my read, or if scum killed me, that would set up potential misinterpretation as nobody would know who I protected. The safest play was to protect you since that was the unanimous consensus by anyone who offered an opinion about it.</div></blockquote><br>Let's say you had not followed this advice (which you did not indicate you would do) and protected scum.  I would have been mislynched.  What then?</div></blockquote><br>However, Rofl brought this one up, which I think is a valid question: what was the point in this question? You claimed you did it to evaluate Scott, but what kind of answer were you expecting from this question? Your interaction with Scott was very odd. Protecting you that Night, after the suggestion the Day before, was the obvious choice for a weak Doc, and your 'evaluation' of Scott feels like a desire to jump on the wagon. To find something to give you an excuse to pounce on. So, explain this please.<br><br>But what really bothers me is that the whole Rofl-Amrun argument from yesterday just went *poof* today, and everything is suddenly dandy. Amrun was heavily doubting Rofl's claim yesterday and referred to it as a null tell, and that he should be judged on play which she referred to it as scum. I don't see how she reconsidered when nothing has really changed from yesterday besides Pine town flip, which I would expect Amrun town to jump all over Rofl for that. When I was reading the arguments between them yesterday, I got the sense that Rofl really felt that a scum roleblocker would balance our town roles, so the jump to town Amrun today feels off. The fact that others have defined their reasonings on Amrun being town much more thoroughly besides the weak doc investigation, and that seems to be the only reason he's given for town-Amrun. <br><br>I need more people to look into this, though. I may be too far into confirmation bias since I do most of my thinking at work without the thread in front of me. I do feel like I'm onto something, though.<br><br>Other stuff:<br><br>The lack of counterwagon from FightingShadow's slot is troublesome. After going through it in other games, I've come to fear it. Some players are jumping on it when there wasn't much from them on the slot before. I like Starbuck's posts, although I need to read more into them since I only gave a quick readthrough. I feel other people should at least attempt to look into others. What happens if Starbuck flips town? <br><br>Saul I get scummy vibes from him. A lot of it is due to the way he approaches his scum reads. He seems to make his accusations/answers preemptively, and it doesn't sit right with me. I don't like the lack of stance on Rofl. It fence sitting, and I feel it will be used to swing his opinion on Rofl wherever he needs to come tomorrow or whenever he plans to reveal it. <br><br>For now,<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Saulres</span><br><br>until I can get some more thoughts on Amrun/Rofl.<br><br>Sleepy time now."}

Okay, no biggie, still Day 1. After that, there's no defense of it. He didn't catch up on the goings on. He didn't provide any type of content. Nothing. Nada. <br><br>Oman has 27 posts in this game, if we exclude his confirmation post and his double post around 408/409 - 25. <br><br>He jumped on Kdowns first thing and rode it all they way through Day 1 without saying anything else about the dude or ANYONE else, for that matter. He just went on about the off-game topic about the Queen. He, then, doesn't return to the game until Day 2. His last post was on June 14th and Day 1 ended on June 16th. <br><br>KageLord definitely feels like an elaborate bus. You know, I would lean towards a you/Oman scum team. You go after KageLord hard on Day 1, and Oman stays completely away from it until Day 2. I'm feeling more and more confident about that, the more I think about it. <br><br>Also, this quick defense of Oman is rather odd and making me question this faith that the town has had in you all game. I mean, have you even mentioned Oman at all? Let's see....<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/search.php?keywords=Oman&amp;terms=all&amp;author=Amrun&amp;fid%5B%5D=2&amp;sc=1&amp;sf=all&amp;sr=posts&amp;sk=t&amp;sd=d&amp;st=0&amp;ch=1000&amp;t=0&amp;submit=Search\" class=\"postlink\">Amrun's mentions of Oman</a> - you have exactly eight mentions of him, excluding a quote that his name turns up in and your immediate jump to his defense when it comes to Giitah is apparent, just like it is now.<br><br>It's a way out there theory, but I think Amrun has been protecting Oman all game. Just take a look at that above link and how the only time she talks about him is to come to his defense. I'd safely say that if Oman flips scum then we need to lynch Amrun without prejudice. I also wouldn't be surprised if rofl is in on this elaborate plan, his unwillingness to make his own decisions this late in the game is not coming off as particularly town."}

Which does make me doubt our town list (Amrun, Rofl, Kanye). And it's confounded further by the fact that I can't seem to find a satisfactory scum group in the remaining players.

I've been thinking back to the possibility of Rofl-Amrun scumteam. The team just makes sense. Rofl seems too comfortable with having Amrun being town on the weak doc innocent. Looking back at what he's said about it, he keeps mentioning that unless a roleblocker flips, Amrun should be considered town. What about the possibility that Amrun is the roleblocker? I meant to bring this up yesterday before the lynch happened. His reversal from Day 2 that I mentioned before is also scummy as hell. Amrun herself while coming out strong Day 1 and 2 has basically done jack since then. Part of it may have been the V/LA, but yesterday was bad.

It implies limited Tracker, Weak Doc, and Neighbors which isn't too powerful against a scum role, probably a roleblocker or scum commuter (is that Normal?). So on that basis, it seems like either the innocent on Amrun is true or the claim by Rofl is fake. I do think one of those two is scum, though. We need massclaim. <br><br>Saulres seems like the likely partner to either of them, but the possibility of Amrun-Oman team making me uneasy after yesterday. I haven't read too much into Oman-Rofl. I also need to read Kage. Saul, can we get that read on Rofl now? I would say Saul-Oman is a possibility, but I don't think Amrun and Rofl are both town, so I'm willing to ignore that pair unless someone can come up with some convincing evidence.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Reck, deadline is 9 days.

I find the games a lot less entertaining than I used to, and  players are more personally aggressive than I remember. Actions are taken as personal slights and the game has gone from cute and violent to inherently violent in all aspects. I don't like that the game now revolves around threats and meta, two of the weakest elements in play. Add to that the continuing shift towards roles that players don't understand (a not-quite-perfect example is Amrun getting confirmed) and I find mafia games to be a confusing mess of people being horrible to each other. <br><br>It is, of course, fair to call me on my lack of effort as of late. I don't have the free time I used to, and very few games or players actually make me want to spend time reading the pages and pages of threats and meta as discussed. I (unfairly on several players and reck) let myself go lax on this game as I found myself enjoying it less and less.<br><br>However, what really erks me is that I am getting called out for my play and being told people will never play with me again when Rofl fake claimed a guilty on a townie... Like I said, I didn't perform well, and haven't for a long time, but is everyone letting that go by?"}
