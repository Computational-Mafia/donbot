You may request a deadline extension, but it is up to my final decision whether or not I grant the extension based on what I've seen. There will not be a lynch if the game goes to night due to this deadline--someone has to consciously place a hammer vote.<br>\n    </li><li>You may choose to go to night without a lynch before then, by having at least half of the players vote: No Lynch. (That's half, not a full majority.)<br>\n    </li><li>Votes should be posted in the format 'vote: Barack Obama.' I expect them to be entirely bold, but don't try to exploit this to trick someone. I'll count what I damn well want to count. I will register misspellings and nicknames if I can figure out who you're referring to. You do not have to unvote, but you're welcome to do so anyway.<br>\n    </li><li>When a player has the majority of the votes at a single point, they are dead and the game goes to twilight. You may post in twilight until I get a lynch scene up.<br>\n    </li><li>Night deadlines are usually going to be 72-hours, or whenever I receive all actions. If you have a role but don't want to perform a night action, just PM me with the phrase No Night Action so I know you've made your choice.<br>\n    </li><li>If any anti-town faction does not submit a kill at night, they will no kill and the day phase will continue.</li></ul><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"font-size: 120%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">&#8232;&#8232;What is and isn't allowed:</div></div><br>\n<ul>\n    <li>Unless otherwise specified, living players can't communicate with each other out of the thread. I will set up a QuickTopic for anyone who is able to communicate with someone else.<br>\n    </li><li>You may rant to both dead players and nonplaying friends, although you're encouraged to first make sure that said friends aren't interested in replacing in with you. (I am of course available, sympathetic and discrete.) Regardless of where you found them, rantbuddies may not reveal their own opinions on the game.<br>\n    </li><li>\"Dead\" means \"dead.\" You can have one \"Bah! I'm dead! Go town!\" post afterwards, but if it contains any game relevant information, I will delete it, bring you back from the dead, and modkill you just to prove a point.<br>\n    </li><li>Read your role PM and summarize it in your confirmation PM response to me. Unless I've posted it publicly, you may not reference its wording in-thread. You can paraphrase if you must claim, but any direct quotation of any PMs will result in a modkill. If you are unsure of whether you can say something or not, PM me and ask.<br>\n    </li><li>Green font and area tags are my domain. Don't use them. Don't pretend to use them.<br>\n    </li><li>You may only type in default font, italics, bold, underline, etc. Do not increase or decrease default font size, do not change font colors, etc.</li></ul><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"font-size: 120%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">&#8232;&#8232;What to expect from me:</div></div><br>\n<ul>\n    <li>Do try to be active, and leave a notification in-thread and/or by PM if that's not possible. I will automatically prod anyone who has not posted in over 48 hours. I will make all prods public in the thread.<br>\n    </li><li>If you don't post in-thread in response to a prod within 24 hours, I will seek a replacement to take over your role. I may seek replacement for a player who lurks consistently without breaking this rule, but you'll have some sort of warning first.<br>\n    </li><li>If you receive three prods in a row without much contribution to the game, you will automatically be replaced.<br>\n    </li><li>I'll try to post votecounts regularly. If you feel it has been too long since the last one, request one. If I make errors, please correct me.<br>\n    </li><li>I'm one of those \"spirit-of-the-game\"-type hippies. This ruleset is a guideline. I reserve the right to change it at will, and even in extreme circumstances enforce it retroactively.

By dubbing, I assume you are talking about English dubbing over the original Japanese, in which case I would respond that it's not a characteristic of anime (but American broadcasts of anime) and you shouldn't be watching it in English in most cases.

Policy pressuring is essentially the same, but the intention is not to lynch. The intention is to get kdowns to actually help town when I know he is capable of doing so. However, the pressure part comes in if a near majority is willing to put pressure votes on him. At that point, he has the choice of either providing some useful content or being lynched. It's actually a pretty nice system for dealing with crappy play, I think.<br>\n<br>\nAnd the reason I couldn't just vote him is that the whole thing only works if at least 5 people are willing to do it with me.

Did you see that I *gasp* BLATANTLY SAID THAT?<br>\n<br>\nScott, you just made me feel better about my deadline compromise - thanks.<br>\n<br>\nBut it's one of the easiest deadline compromise I've ever made.  You're just scrambling to throw shit on anyone you possibly you can.  You do realize that I literally started the wagons on BOTH of you, right, Scott?  So how exactly am I wishy-washy?  I've had exactly three scum reads all game: you, KageLord, and Giitah, and I withdrew my more minor FoS on Giitah and like her as town.<br>\n<br>\nI wasn't the first vote on your wagon, Scott, but I was the first to voice suspicion of you, and Pine, the first vote on your wagon, was sheeping ME.  My first suspicion of you came BEFORE your bad vote on the KageLord wagon; I haven't like you since RVS, in fact, when you failed to vote until I reminded you.  Then, I really disliked how you just commented on the fluff and not on the content, at which point I voiced my suspicion of you.  And then you made a really hypocritical vote on KageLord that I called you out on.  Your main and best point on KageLord was his pre-emptive associative tells, but several other people had committed the same thing BEFORE your vote and THEN roflcopter after your vote, and none of these people were worthy of a mention or of your suspicion - only KageLord, after I got the wagon going on him.<br>\n<br>\nThen again, KageLord's entrance to YOUR wagon was just as survivalistic.  At least one of you two are scum, and I'd bet my life on it.  I lean towards Kage as the scummiest of the pair, but you are scum lord #2, and you trying to paint me as opportunistic (over someone like roflcopter, for example) is just laughable when I created dueling wagons on my suspects out of thin air.  I can vote on either wagon because I made that shit happen.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nI forgot to include a vote then posted in the same minute as you with a vote. Go ahead and think you \"reminded\" me. That's scummy? That is laughable. Grasp at more straws please. <br>\n<br>\nCan you show me where you had the early suspicion on me due to this pathetic tell? Or did you just conveniently bring it up an hour ago? <br>\n<br>\nThe main point was not the associative tells. To act like that was the only part of my case is a huge misrep. The main point was the meek asking if anyone wanted to pressure kdowns. That is completely scummy, testing the climate to see if that lynch was viable. As i have said ad nauseum, useless associations are not a strong enough tell on its own, but adds to a case.

Again, a town or scum move. Town motivation is to get a still good lynch by deadline. Scum motivation if Scott is town is to push along a different mislynch. Scum motivation if Scott is also scum is to get a bus in during that crucial interval between &#8220;new wagon emerging&#8221; and &#8220;sure lynch&#8221;.<br>\nISO 25-33 &#8211; Defends switching onto Scott.<br>\nISO 34 &#8211; Doesn&#8217;t believe Scott&#8217;s claim, but back to me as his claim will work itself out.<br>\nISO 35 &#8211; Not that opposed to kdowns lynch, but doesn&#8217;t want to leave actual suspect for lurker.<br>\nOverall &#8211; I got on the Amrun wagon because it seemed like the best start to getting out of RVS and I didn&#8217;t like the way she defended herself. The quick turn on me (and the lie to defend her earlier statement) obviously didn&#8217;t help my opinion of her. The rest of the day is harder to read because her moves could have either town or scum motivation. I also give her slight scumpoints for how strongly she is going after me, since she would know it&#8217;s an easy mislynch and it stops it from looking like she&#8217;s backtracking.

Again, easy way for scum to get on my wagon while avoiding some suspicion, but also a decent enough reason from town. If not for the last thing, I would say this was null, but&#8230; it strikes me as odd now.<br>\nOverall &#8211; I could understand his comment about being willing to push my wagon through at deadline if that was it, but the fact that he kept taking small steps toward my wagon (possibly laying the seeds for eventually joining my wagon or just trying to avoid leaving a footprint on it while still not making waves) while pushing others and continues to do so D2 is rubbing me the wrong way.

This sounds close to backtracking to me, but I may be biased.<br>\nISO 9 &#8211; When asked about roflcopter, he disapproves of tunneling and relation tells but says he is a secondary scumread with FightingShadow (surprising considering how much more of that stuff rofl has done).<br>\nISO 10 &#8211; Disapproves of kdowns lynch and everyone on his wagon.

If she's scum, either the scum have a roleblocker, or (less likely) some way of preventing Amrun from being targeted.  A roleblocker could just continue roleblocking the weak doctor until a better choice for them came along, and with only one death last night, odds are it's exactly what it looks like -- Scott protected a townie.

Scum already have two confirmed townies absorbing their night kills, you're not going to draw a kill by making vague allusions to fake role info, and if you have real role info, we'd be approaching the point where the game would be won already by revealing it.<br>\n<br>\nActually, that goes for everyone. If you have role info, there's no time like the present. Don't listen to the chumps who think massclaims should wait until lylo. Massclaims should happen AT LEAST a day before possible lylo, and in situations where the scum are behind (like, say, 1/3 of them are dead, while 2/7 of the town are 100% confirmed and thus completely unlynchable), they should happen even earlier.<br>\n<br>\nAnyway. Back to rofl. If all you have is a strong town read on kanye, then I repeat; I'd like to hear the reasons. I trust you. I don't trust him. I have been burned before for thinking that kanye was obvtown when he wasn't town at all. If I just take your word for it now, I could be just taking your word forever, because I am not long for this world. I don't want to do that.<br>\n<br>\nI know I'm probably just being paranoid, and that Pine is probably going to flip scum here. I've just lost too many games by not bothering to consider all the angles and just assuming that things will work out. I don't want to do that here. Pine is not guaranteed to flip scum.

I'll request replacement if it happens again or try to go with phone posting. <br>\n<br>\nI did manage to reread the thread, and I did catch some things of FightingShadow that were a bit off, particularly more when I ISO'ed him. In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4104731#p4104731\" class=\"postlink\">#96</a>, he acknowledges some of the scummy vibes he's getting from some players and then votes for kdowns, as if attempting to avoid the other wagons, and his reasons for voting kdowns seem more minor in comparison. And then he parks his vote there. His case is meh, especially with other stuff going on in the thread. He admits later that he finds one of his posts suspicious, but he reluctantly didn't put KageLord at L-1, so I don't know where exactly he was headed without really pushing his read on kdowns. Seems to just be waiting for the KageLord wagon to go away. <br>\n<br>\nHowever, the hammer on Day 2 I think isn't as suspicious as we made it out to be. He seemed to be barely keeping up with the game (evident with his Kanye vote), so I don't think he would be putting too much thought about the Weak Doc claim as either alignment. But eh, I don't object too much with his lynch. The problem is that he's a lurker really. I've been going back and forth with my read on him at work, and it's driving me crazy. His slot really should get that replacement. <br>\n<br>\nReading Oman over, I'm getting some town vibes. He jumps on the KageLord wagon while everyone else was running after Pine and Scott on Day 2. I don't think a scumbuddy would do that, especially when we theorized that scum didn't kill SCott to get a potential mislynch out of Scott (and the people on that wagon are all on the town list). Which does make me doubt our town list (Amrun, Rofl, Kanye). And it's confounded further by the fact that I can't seem to find a satisfactory scum group in the remaining players. Saulres-FS I guess is possible (and I feel like Saulres is really trying to keep his options open - more on that later), but some of their interactions seem to indicate otherwise. Dunno.<br>\n<br>\nThere's also some posts from Amrun and Rofl that I need to find again as well that I feel need questioning. I'll get to these tomorrow after some sleep. Also, what happened to the massclaim proposed yesterday? Didn't really see the drawback in that, so we should probably do it today. I really want to try to figure out this setup because something is bugging me that I feel I'm missing something. <br>\n<br>\nNow I sleep.", "time": "Sun Jul 15, 2012 11:19 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=22267&start=525", "forum": "53", "thread": "22267"}

There's plenty of days until deadline, I made sure of that with Reck before I replaced in.<br>\n<br>\nI do things very thoroughly when I catch up, so I do find this to be pretty scumtastic. A town outlook would give appreciation for fresh eyes on the game.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: normal; display: inline\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Day 1</div></div><br>\n<br>\nWith a name like \"kanyeknowsbest\", I'm surprised this dude survived based on his name. <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\"> I do find his remark after KageLord's #34 and #35 a bit odd, especially with KageLord turning out to be scum.

Only further reading will tell.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nThat quick wagon on Amrun about anime is scumtastic, and my predecessor doesn't help our role by jumping aboard this at all. I would have stayed far from it. <br>\n<br>\nTown points to Amrun for the early detection of scum-KageLord. What I'm wondering, at this point, is why the lynch on kdowns over obvscum-Kage. Probably could have saved a few days of pain if that happened, and if KageLord still plays like I remember.<br>\n<br>\nI'm not cool with kanye's jump on the KageLord wagon, as he brings nothing to the table with a case of his own.<br>\n<br>\nPine, who turned out to be town, seemed to just not be able to get his point across. kanye just seems to be posting in to quick of a succession to really be reading his own words over before posting, which could have helped him not be misunderstood. I'm questioning roflcopter's contribution to the conversation on page 5 as he is just reiterating the obvious and not really adding anything. Basically, posting for the sake of looking active without providing anything of content whatsoever.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Giitah wrote:</cite>Finally, Oman's lurking scum.</div></blockquote><br>\nI'm glad someone pointed this out. <br>\n<br>\nI can see Giitah's point about using the word \"scum\" as a means of pressure and of drawing someone out of the shadows, particularly on Day 1. I like his and Amrun's exchange, more town points for Amrun. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\nI sincerely don't like Oman's response to Giitah. It's one thing to explain where you were, but it's another to just insult the dude. You took four lines to explain where you were and then added nothing of substance, like you just came in to look for your name. I don't like it.<br>\n<br>\nI also can't imagine what your working hours were like for the Queen's birthday. <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>roflcopter wrote:</cite>this whole exchange is going to look especially funny once kage and pine have both flipped scum</div></blockquote><br>\nThis sticks out to me due to the now-revealed alignment of Kage and Pine, and also the fact that rofl can't seem to comment on anything else going on. Instead, he just keeps rolling with the spam. I'm feeling like he's distancing from Kage so that when Kage does flip, he can go: \"See! See! I fucking told you guys!\"<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nI still don't like Oman, his next posts are just ones that concern him and still he adds nothing of substance and derailing into Queen's Birthday discussions.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nI do not like rofl's entry onto the kdowns wagon in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4123307#p4123307\" class=\"postlink\">#195</a>. I understand that the guy has added nothing, but at this point neither has Oman. The choice of kdowns by rofl makes me feel as though he is trying to keep focus off Oman.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>YYR wrote:</cite>I'll gladly take a Pine lynch since the KageLord wagon is disappearing.</div></blockquote><br>\nThis is a shitty vote-hop and with absolutely no semblance of your own case, uber scummy.

I would have been mislynched.  What then?</div></blockquote><br>\nHowever, Rofl brought this one up, which I think is a valid question: what was the point in this question? You claimed you did it to evaluate Scott, but what kind of answer were you expecting from this question? Your interaction with Scott was very odd. Protecting you that Night, after the suggestion the Day before, was the obvious choice for a weak Doc, and your 'evaluation' of Scott feels like a desire to jump on the wagon. To find something to give you an excuse to pounce on. So, explain this please.<br>\n<br>\nBut what really bothers me is that the whole Rofl-Amrun argument from yesterday just went *poof* today, and everything is suddenly dandy. Amrun was heavily doubting Rofl's claim yesterday and referred to it as a null tell, and that he should be judged on play which she referred to it as scum. I don't see how she reconsidered when nothing has really changed from yesterday besides Pine town flip, which I would expect Amrun town to jump all over Rofl for that. When I was reading the arguments between them yesterday, I got the sense that Rofl really felt that a scum roleblocker would balance our town roles, so the jump to town Amrun today feels off. The fact that others have defined their reasonings on Amrun being town much more thoroughly besides the weak doc investigation, and that seems to be the only reason he's given for town-Amrun. <br>\n<br>\nI need more people to look into this, though. I may be too far into confirmation bias since I do most of my thinking at work without the thread in front of me. I do feel like I'm onto something, though.<br>\n<br>\nOther stuff:<br>\n<br>\nThe lack of counterwagon from FightingShadow's slot is troublesome. After going through it in other games, I've come to fear it. Some players are jumping on it when there wasn't much from them on the slot before. I like Starbuck's posts, although I need to read more into them since I only gave a quick readthrough. I feel other people should at least attempt to look into others. What happens if Starbuck flips town? <br>\n<br>\nSaul I get scummy vibes from him. A lot of it is due to the way he approaches his scum reads. He seems to make his accusations/answers preemptively, and it doesn't sit right with me. I don't like the lack of stance on Rofl. It fence sitting, and I feel it will be used to swing his opinion on Rofl wherever he needs to come tomorrow or whenever he plans to reveal it. <br>\n<br>\nFor now,<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Saulres</span><br>\n<br>\nuntil I can get some more thoughts on Amrun/Rofl.<br>\n<br>\nSleepy time now.", "time": "Sat Jul 21, 2012 2:43 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=22267&start=575", "forum": "53", "thread": "22267"}

Okay, no biggie, still Day 1. After that, there's no defense of it. He didn't catch up on the goings on. He didn't provide any type of content. Nothing. Nada. <br>\n<br>\nOman has 27 posts in this game, if we exclude his confirmation post and his double post around 408/409 - 25. <br>\n<br>\nHe jumped on Kdowns first thing and rode it all they way through Day 1 without saying anything else about the dude or ANYONE else, for that matter. He just went on about the off-game topic about the Queen. He, then, doesn't return to the game until Day 2. His last post was on June 14th and Day 1 ended on June 16th. <br>\n<br>\nKageLord definitely feels like an elaborate bus. You know, I would lean towards a you/Oman scum team. You go after KageLord hard on Day 1, and Oman stays completely away from it until Day 2. I'm feeling more and more confident about that, the more I think about it. <br>\n<br>\nAlso, this quick defense of Oman is rather odd and making me question this faith that the town has had in you all game.

Rofl seems too comfortable with having Amrun being town on the weak doc innocent. Looking back at what he's said about it, he keeps mentioning that unless a roleblocker flips, Amrun should be considered town. What about the possibility that Amrun is the roleblocker? I meant to bring this up yesterday before the lynch happened. His reversal from Day 2 that I mentioned before is also scummy as hell. Amrun herself while coming out strong Day 1 and 2 has basically done jack since then. Part of it may have been the V/LA, but yesterday was bad. Didn't push her scumread on Rofl, opting instead to lynch the guy she has barely ever mentioned. Jumping on the easy lynch.<br>\n<br>\nThe only thing that bothers me is that the setup seems unbalanced unless we have another power role. It implies limited Tracker, Weak Doc, and Neighbors which isn't too powerful against a scum role, probably a roleblocker or scum commuter (is that Normal?). So on that basis, it seems like either the innocent on Amrun is true or the claim by Rofl is fake. I do think one of those two is scum, though. We need massclaim. <br>\n<br>\nSaulres seems like the likely partner to either of them, but the possibility of Amrun-Oman team making me uneasy after yesterday. I haven't read too much into Oman-Rofl. I also need to read Kage. Saul, can we get that read on Rofl now? I would say Saul-Oman is a possibility, but I don't think Amrun and Rofl are both town, so I'm willing to ignore that pair unless someone can come up with some convincing evidence.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Reck, deadline is 9 days.

When I said \"dead end\" yesterday, I wasn't completely honest.

I find the games a lot less entertaining than I used to, and  players are more personally aggressive than I remember. Actions are taken as personal slights and the game has gone from cute and violent to inherently violent in all aspects. I don't like that the game now revolves around threats and meta, two of the weakest elements in play. Add to that the continuing shift towards roles that players don't understand (a not-quite-perfect example is Amrun getting confirmed) and I find mafia games to be a confusing mess of people being horrible to each other. <br>\n<br>\nIt is, of course, fair to call me on my lack of effort as of late. I don't have the free time I used to, and very few games or players actually make me want to spend time reading the pages and pages of threats and meta as discussed. I (unfairly on several players and reck) let myself go lax on this game as I found myself enjoying it less and less.<br>\n<br>\nHowever, what really erks me is that I am getting called out for my play and being told people will never play with me again when Rofl fake claimed a guilty on a townie... Like I said, I didn't perform well, and haven't for a long time, but is everyone letting that go by?", "time": "Wed Aug 01, 2012 4:51 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=22267&start=775", "forum": "53", "thread": "22267"}
