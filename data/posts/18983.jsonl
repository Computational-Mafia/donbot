I have the final say if there are any disputes. However, I do make mistakes. Please let me know if you notice an error.<br>2. Personal attacks are not acceptable. Please remember this is a game and everyone is here to have fun.<br>3. Do not quote any private communication, whether it is a private message from me, or a QuickTopic with another player. Paraphrasing is fine.<br>4. Do not discuss the game outside of the thread, and don\u2019t discuss other ongoing games within the thread.<br>5. Don\u2019t use unreadable text, such as invisible text, small text, encrypted text, or text hidden within tags.<br>6. If you are, for some reason or another, able to edit posts, don\u2019t edit them.<br>7. Do not claim scum or claim your scumpartners.<br>8. Anything that is illegal to do is also illegal to fake.<br>9. I will post in a <span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #008000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">bolded green</span></span></span> font. Please don\u2019t use this color, or any similar colors.<br>10a. Modkills will be done in a way that is the most detrimental to your faction. Your role will then be converted to Neutral Survivor, autolossing you.<br>10b. Modkills will only be used in situations where the broken rule has an effect on the outcome of the game. In less major situations, Force Replacements will be used instead.<br><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Activity and Deadlines:</span><br>1. If you are on Vacation/Limited Access, please post in the thread or send me a private message. I do not check signatures or the V/LA thread.<br>2a. If you do not post for 72 hours, you will be prodded.<br>2b. After being prodded, you have 24 hours to post before I begin searching for a replacement.<br>3. If you are prodded 3 times, your next prod will automatically result in a replacement.<br>4. Day 1 will have a deadline of  3 weeks. Each day after that will have a deadline of 2 weeks.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Gameplay:</span><br>1. Votes must be in bold. Unvotes are appreciated, but not required.<br>2. A lynch is reached when a majority of the living players vote for the same player.<br>3. A no lynch occurs when the deadline is reached without a lynch, or when half of living players vote for a no lynch.<br>4. Votes cannot be changed after a lynch or a no lynch occurs.<br>5. All players, including the player who was lynched, can continue to post during twilight.<br>6. Nights will have a deadline of 72 hours. <br>7. Any night action that I don\u2019t receive by the deadline will be forfeited. You may change your action as many times as you want until the deadline.<br>8. Dead players can make one contentless \u201cBah\u201d post.<br>9. Always play to your win condition, but also remember to have fun!<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Game-Specific:</span><br>1. This game will follow Normal Game guidelines.<br>2. A sample Vanilla Townie role PM is as follows:<blockquote><div><cite>Vanilla Townie Role PM wrote:</cite>Hello, <span class=\"noboldsig\">[playername]</span>, and welcome to <span class=\"noboldsig\">Classic Mafia</span>!

Post #74 is just bad. It's one thing to call lurkers scum reads, such as if we had been listed, but people who haven't confirmed likely don't even know that the game has started yet and there is literally nothing there to constitute a scum read. The post was a cop out, plain and simple.<br><br>5. He seems to be saying that it's not possible to catch scum early on. But both Viscera's and Lunitawolf's actions so far don't come off as townie and regardless of whether or not it is likely, they are still the scummiest two players right now and there is no reason not to vote them for being suspicious. To suggest otherwise is just ludicrous.<br><br>6. What could possibly justify his most recent vote on Draken. Why vote for literally the only person who won't make a response beccause he doesn't even know the game has started? You can't even claim wanting to promote activity because there are plenty of players who are confirmed who haven't posted. Us, for instance. It just reads as super opportunistic.<br><br>For the record, we've also got a scum read on Lunitawolf for the following reasons:<br><br>1.Post #33 is a shit post. I don't really approve of that type of nonchalant crap when things are becoming serious. The post does nothing to further the game or clarify her stance on Viscera. And if it is a serious reason for a town read, it's a terrible reason.<br><br>2.Post #40 is bad too. Already covered why it's a bad post.<br><br>3. Don't really agree with the CES vote, but that's because he leans town to us.<br><br>These are the general pillars of our case on those two."}

Hito's play has been more or less nothing but town so far, his reasoning for Viscera town is solid and one I completely agree with. I don't see hito as scum.<br><br>Viscera: First of all, Viscera has stated in thread she has done research on meta. Unless she is an alt, I cannot see that coming from someone with a scum role PM and her join date. Additionally, even if she is an alt, her play has still been relatively obvtown. Hito's logic on her <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3421617#p3421617\" class=\"postlink\">here</a> is correct. Her attitude toward the Lunita bandwagon also makes her likely town.<br><br>Lunita: Slightly weaker than the first two but still a confident town read. Its slight gut, I had her null-town until <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3420372#p3420372\" class=\"postlink\">here</a>. The reasoning for voting here is logical and comes from more of a town perspective. I'm not for sure I agree with it so far, I'll need more from the other hydra before I read them, but the vote here looks town. Her vote/unvote on CES also makes her fairly town. It just didn't \"feel\" like scum OMGUSing or backing off a lynch.</fieldset><br><fieldset style=\"border:3px outset grey; padding:5px 10px\">David Xanatos: This is a fairly weak town read, but <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3417623#p3417623\" class=\"postlink\">this post</a> and <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3417623#p3417623\" class=\"postlink\">this post</a> don't look like something scum would say. I'll need more from David to get a good town read, but I don't understand why scum would try to pressure someone based on something like \"setting up a fakeclaim\" this early in the game. The fact he supported it with the wiki statement makes me think he's being sincere, though a bit overambitious.<br><br>CES: This is a weak town read, but its here. Mainly for his logic on the unvote <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3416184#p3416184\" class=\"postlink\">here</a>. I've only seen CES town though, and I've seen him as town a lot. He seems to be playing up to that meta. <span class=\"noboldsig\">CES, could you link me to a recent scum game of yours?</span>.</fieldset><br><fieldset style=\"border:3px outset grey; padding:5px 10px\">Scumhunter: Scumhunter is actually a really easy read for me. I've seen him as scum in two (completed) games and I think I've got a very good handle on how he plays as scum/town. I see he's V/LA. Needs more content, but I'm not worried about this slot at all.<br><br>Ryu: I'll need more from the Ryu hydra. I don't like how they just made a huge case on one person, but Its not enough to have a scum read on them.<br><br>Jase: If I had to have Jase either way I would say town, but nothing in his ISO has popped out at me so far.<br><br>Killer: Needs more content. Initially I wanted to say scum, but a quick background check suggests he is one of <span style=\"font-style: italic\">those players</span>.<br><br>TheFool: Initially I had a scum read on TheFool, but on reread I'm not confident enough to put him in either category yet. He isn't scum with viscera, lunita,</fieldset><br><fieldset style=\"border:3px outset grey; padding:5px 10px\">Alabaska J: Needs more content. I have a null here. His post asking if we were still in RVS was ehhhhh. If he flips scum I might have the Lunita town read wrong because of <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3413727#p3413727\" class=\"postlink\">this post</a>. Just an awkward interaction. It seems like he is subtly downplaying the importance of that vote. If this is the case, Lunita might be scum and TheFool might be town. An Alabaska J scum flip doesnt really confirm Lunita as scum though, she is still a fairly strong town read of mine.<br><br>Dry-Fit: Parroting other reads, and attacking someone for \"fake scumhunting\". Need more from this slot, but right now this is the best thing out there I think.</fieldset><br><br><br>-----<br><span class=\"noboldsig\"> Vote Dry-Fit</span><br>----<br><br>This has all been slaxx. Gaoth is at a game right now, once he gets home he can weigh in on this, but I wanted to get this out here now."}

Solid town read.<br><br>Killer: Low content. I dislike his 115 and 137. 115 is really really weak. I feel like 137 may be setting up a mislynch (even though I like the dryfit wagon)  Already rationalizing for him to flip town (With the VI reasoning tacked onto his case) and preemptively casting suspicion in case of a townflip as well. Reasonably strong scum read, probably not scum with dryfit.<br><br>Lunitawolf: Personally I feel null. My early reasoning wasn't very strong and I don't put much stock in the \"Defending them self at the expense of scumhunting\" tell. I find that town does this more or less as much as scum. Don't see why she looks so town to some people, but most (if not all) of those people are town reads. So I'm feeling null but assuming town.<br><br>Odysseus: Good scumhunting. I find myself agreeing with most of what he's said. Probably town.<br><br>Ryuu Link: Don't care for the way he's linked lunita and viscera already. Since his initial case against the two he hasn't pursued either of them, or done much else. Null-scum.<br><br>Scumhunter: V/LA before posting content is lame. Not a scum tell or anything just inconvenient. Null obviously.<br><br>Fool: There hasn't been a lot from him but our logic has mostly lined up at least at the time. So I'm feeling mildly town on him.<br><br>VisceraEyes: There's some shit I want addressed before I commit to a read on VE. He seems to be ignoring me some more though. Specifically my 121 (or 84).<br><br>Hopefully this post will mark the end of my shitty contribution levels.<br><br>Anyways it's time to<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: Killer</span><br><br>At the very least until I find out why I'm not supposed to be putting another vote on dryfit."}

You may have prevented more votes from being placed but getting up to four or five people on the wagon would not have been a bad thing with 7 required for a lynch.

Town doesn't want a quicklynch (I don't think it would be to controversial for me to say that it is still too early for a lynch). Even if we had some townies who wanted a quicklynch we've got more than enough people who aren't idiots to derail an actual quicklynch threat. If a quicklynch was still possible the sane town would probably threaten to lynch the hammerer the next day. Not a good trade for scum and I really don't think we have anyone near VI enough to try something like that as town. Shit was safe as houses.<br><br>The reason this is a sticking point for me is that to me it looked very much like scum trying to gain town points by starting a crusade against something awful (a quicklynch), or possibly scum suspecting a quicklynch for whatever reason and grabbing towncred by opposing it from the start.<br><br>As for the random lynch bit, why not advocate we do something that isn't anti-town instead of advocating something that is only slightly less anti-town?"}

But both Viscera's and Lunitawolf's actions so far don't come off as townie and regardless of whether or not it is likely, they are still the scummiest two players right now and there is no reason not to vote them for being suspicious. To suggest otherwise is just ludicrous.<br><br>6. What could possibly justify his most recent vote on Draken. Why vote for literally the only person who won't make a response beccause he doesn't even know the game has started? You can't even claim wanting to promote activity because there are plenty of players who are confirmed who haven't posted. Us, for instance.

You are scummy as shit and anyone who hammer you right mow would be perfectly justified. By voting yourself as town, you put yourself one step closer to death, which means that the town has one less townie and has wasted a chance at killing scum. Furthermore, it's one less vote that actually has to be placed on you, which means one less scum that has to jump on your wagon and can remain hidden. Also, by accepting your death rather than trying to stop it, you deny us time that we could spend scumhunting and getting to know you and whether or not you actually are scum or town. On the other hand, all of those things benefit scum if they are in all likelihood going to be lynched anyway, therefore the action is anti-town and if by some chance you are town, then you are a fool and you are doing a disservice to the town.<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3433570#p3433570\" class=\"postlink\">post 248</a>, David Xanatos wrote:</cite>You know what?<br><br>I'm rather sick of people thinking that the best way of defending yourself is to insult the people who are suspicious of them.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: </span><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Killer</span><br><br>I don't care.

He's the same scummy player you voted for.  Don't tell me you were voting to prod contribution, because he already showed disinterest in scumhunting (I don't count BLATANT OMGUS as scumhunting, and if you do you're high,) so what is this anyway, some inflated case of voters remorse?  Are you trying to score easy town-points because you know this is a mislynch?  What's going on here exactly?</div></blockquote><br>You are quite wrong to say nothing has changed. First of all, the self-vote was huge. At the time I didn't unvote immediately because I had yet to realize just how new he was. As I said originally, the self-vote was either incompetent town or scum motivated. I figured nobody would hammer him that quickly, so I'd give him a lecture on why self-voting is bad and see how he proceeded from there, but as Xanatos decided to hammer, that changed things. Then I went and looked at his previous games, which are unfinished, but quite enlightening if you'd care to look yourself. Obviously, if he flips scum, my argument against Xanatos is less valid, but Xanatos has experience with killer, so I find the hammer suspicious. Also, he's still conducting himself as though he's town even though he's been hammered. And that scummy non-defense you think is so unimportant is actually pretty important in showing you just how much he doesn't understand the game and it will be clear once he flips. I couldn't give a flying fuck about towncred; I rarely do. I'm just calling the situation like I see it and Xanatos is getting lynched tomorrow if killer does flip town.<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3433627#p3433627\" class=\"postlink\">post 268</a>, VisceraEyes wrote:</cite>Who AM I talking to by the way RL?</div></blockquote><br>Hikari Link, of course. hahonryuu could never type this well.

My interpretation relies completely on his experience with killer, but his eagerness to jump on nearly lynched wagons with little to no explanation feels off to me. Since the lynches are so close, it gives him a plausible out to not have to explain his case and I don't like it. As I said before, placement is just as important as explanation and in his case he's got negative marks in both categories regarding both killer and Dry-fit."}

Honestly, I'd just as soon lynch him and be done with it, but we'll play your little game for now. I'm not really sure what he has up his sleeve and where you fit into it. My gut says you are scum, but unless there are 4 scum, you'd both be fools to attempt this gambit unless you had some sort of ridiculous ace up your sleeve. A mislynch will mean his death and like your own, so it seems unlikely you'd both flaunt your scumminess so openly. But then, I an't imagine you being so big of a fool as to believe this tale of wizardry as town. Then again, I don't really know you and I'd say your stances overall sop far have been pretty bad, so I can't say for sure. I suppose we shall see in due time. Perhaps it is I who am merely too paranoid, but I doubt that a great deal."}

I'll be done with V/LA after tomorrow when my crazy travel schedule ends, and I'll be back to regular posting.

I also really don't like how DX claims he investigated Odysseus yesterday. I really would like to explore one of them more. I think they share a faction, and I'm not convinced it's town. Odysseus tells everyone not to \"waste\" a PR investigating DX last night, yet since it turns out they're NOT masons, Odysseus would have no way of knowing what DX really was and, if he had a PR, if it was for town or for mafia. Then DX conveniently claims he investigated Odysseus so there would be no reason to 'waste' a PR investigating Odysseus, and DX conveniently claims that he is a MILLER gunsmith, so as to explain away any investigation on him when it comes back guilty... yeah, no. One of these two is likely getting my vote today.<br><br>- @DX explain why you investigated Odysseus please. Also, why do you think that there are only two mafia members?<br><br>- @Odysseus, no, I'm not scum.

Also, I realized something else about hito's plan that makes it bad. I think town is more likely to tell the truth about having a gun than scum. Scum can lie and say that they don't have a gun and if Xanatos says otherwise and his claim proves to be legit, they could just say they were a real PR and didn't want to claim, snce there's a chance they wouldn't be checked anyway. Town, on the other hand, seem more likely to be cooperative and every person who claims gun and isn't scum is in serious danger tonight and even people claiming no gun is dangerous because it's essentially the same as claiming VT, so those are people that the Mafia can decide not to kill. I really should have noticed it earlier, but I was pretty busy all day. All in all, this plan has the chance for a lot of negative consequences, far more than positive. I'm not sure if it was just poor execution or if there were deeper scum motivations behind it, but either way we can't do much about it now except hope for the best, but the Cop probably wouldn't be amiss checking hito tonight.

At worst for scum, they both claim no gun and you've got two people marked off who aren't Cop/Vig in an already small game. It doesn't matter that he's listed them as suspects in the past if he's scum, because he knows either that both are town and that he can potentially find a Cop/Vg or one is scum and they won't claim gun, semi-clearing them if Xanatos flipped town.

To be honest, if scum have a roleblocker and backup roleblocker, last PR is pretty powerful.<br><br>Also, since the roleblocker is obvious scum, this means there is absolutely no way there is a godfather. To be honest, I am expecting a cop now. If there is a cop who can clear someone with at least one report, I think he should claim. Actually, any investigative PR should. It could produce 2-3 clears. I'd rather not risk cop dying tonight since its obviously not me/dryfit/last scum. This gives scum a 1 in 4 chance of hitting a person with the potential to clear anywhere from himself to 2 other people. So I say if the cop/tracker/RB/JK has at least 1 alive clear, he should claim. This would give us three clears (hopefully some scummy). <br><br>Altogether, we have 3 lynches left. If we have 3 clears (including Dry fit), we just have to pick 2 obvtown in between 5 people.

Post #74 is just bad. It's one thing to call lurkers scum reads, such as if we had been listed, but people who haven't confirmed likely don't even know that the game has started yet and there is literally nothing there to constitute a scum read. The post was a cop out, plain and simple.<br><br>5. He seems to be saying that it's not possible to catch scum early on. But both Viscera's and Lunitawolf's actions so far don't come off as townie and regardless of whether or not it is likely, they are still the scummiest two players right now and there is no reason not to vote them for being suspicious. To suggest otherwise is just ludicrous.<br><br>6. What could possibly justify his most recent vote on Draken. Why vote for literally the only person who won't make a response beccause he doesn't even know the game has started? You can't even claim wanting to promote activity because there are plenty of players who are confirmed who haven't posted. Us, for instance. It just reads as super opportunistic.<br><br>For the record, we've also got a scum read on Lunitawolf for the following reasons:<br><br>1.Post #33 is a shit post. I don't really approve of that type of nonchalant crap when things are becoming serious. The post does nothing to further the game or clarify her stance on Viscera. And if it is a serious reason for a town read, it's a terrible reason.<br><br>2.Post #40 is bad too. Already covered why it's a bad post.<br><br>3.

I also really don't like how DX claims he investigated Odysseus yesterday. I really would like to explore one of them more. I think they share a faction, and I'm not convinced it's town. Odysseus tells everyone not to \"waste\" a PR investigating DX last night, yet since it turns out they're NOT masons, Odysseus would have no way of knowing what DX really was and, if he had a PR, if it was for town or for mafia. Then DX conveniently claims he investigated Odysseus so there would be no reason to 'waste' a PR investigating Odysseus, and DX conveniently claims that he is a MILLER gunsmith, so as to explain away any investigation on him when it comes back guilty... yeah, no.

I had stopped at the hammering point because if there are only 3 scum in this game, and they had only lost one, I just didn't see why he'd hammer his last remaining partner at that point rather than try to argue we should first lynch Dry-Fit or some such. The only weird behavior to add to the below is his saying he should be killed, he's checked out of the game, etc. etc. Not sure what the real motivation is there.<br><br><br>* Day 1: strongly implied he was masons with DX and that we shouldn't lynch DX because he was confirmed town.<br>* Day 2: DX gives his fake claim and Ody says, 'YES! I KNEW HE WAS A PR!' But really... if he had no connection to a DXtown beyond suspecting him of being a townPR, why would he keep flashing lights above DX's head which tells scum to lynch him?<br>* Day 1: Gives a <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3422175#p3422175\" class=\"postlink\">list of reads</a> and says that I am in the Super Town Alliance. He notes suspicion there of AJ asking about RVS, but says \"An Alabaska J scum flip doesnt really confirm Lunita as scum though, she is still a fairly strong town read of mine.\" He tells Ryuu in Post 131 that he thinks Ryuu is wrong about me being scum.<br>* Day 2: goes back to the Day 1 data point of AJ asking about RVS to now say I'm scum. Provides no other evidence other than to say my posting got scummier, but never pointed to anything concrete.<br>* Day 1 Post 275 Odysseus says that if Killer flips scum (he knows he won't) he wants vig shots on Fool/AJ. This could have been a ploy to keep AJ safe because he knew that Killer would flip town, so then the implication is that the vig should not shoot Fool/AJ."}

As far as I'm concerned, Dry is confirmed vig.  I'm not considering an SK for several reasons, but chiefly among them the fact that there has only been a couple of double NKs and one of them hit scum at an inopportune time for third party...scum that Dry-fit drew attention to.  If he were an SK, he wouldn't have drawn attention to his kill that way.  If he suspected he was scum and he was aiming for scum, I very highly doubt he would have A) attacked AlaJ before he killed him and B) claimed the shot.<br><br>Therefor, from where I sit, scum can be found among Jase, hitogoroshi and Lunitawolf.  Jase didn't look good at first, but his posting evened out and he's come across as pretty evenly town to me.  Aside from Lunita's staunch defense of herself, again, nothing really scummy jumps out after a certain point.  The difference between those two is that Lunita has town-told several times where Jase has been lurky and reserved most of the game.<br><br>And so, by process of elimination, that leaves Jase with the rope today.  Dry-fit can aim at any of the rest of us for shits and giggles, he'll either die or be roleblocked in my opinion (of course, that's what I thought last night X(..) so that will leave us with the following options for tomorrow's MYLO showdown if Jase flips town (not bloody likely):<br><br>hito, Lunita, Dry-Fit<br>myself, hito and Lunita<br>Lunita, Dry-Fit, myself<br>hito, Dry-Fit, myself<br><br>I like our chances in ALL of those scenarios."}

Gets off the Lunitawolf wagon the second it gains any sort of momentum. Could be an attempt to protect his scum buddy.<br><br>2. Attempt at a hitogoroshi counter-wagon in a semi-serious tone.

Post #74 is just bad. It's one thing to call lurkers scum reads, such as if we had been listed, but people who haven't confirmed likely don't even know that the game has started yet and there is literally nothing there to constitute a scum read. The post was a cop out, plain and simple.<br><br>5. He seems to be saying that it's not possible to catch scum early on. But both Viscera's and Lunitawolf's actions so far don't come off as townie and regardless of whether or not it is likely, they are still the scummiest two players right now and there is no reason not to vote them for being suspicious. To suggest otherwise is just ludicrous.<br><br>6. What could possibly justify his most recent vote on Draken. Why vote for literally the only person who won't make a response beccause he doesn't even know the game has started? You can't even claim wanting to promote activity because there are plenty of players who are confirmed who haven't posted. Us, for instance. It just reads as super opportunistic.<br><br>For the record, we've also got a scum read on Lunitawolf for the following reasons:<br><br>1.Post #33 is a shit post.

Yet I *know* people are wrong about me, so it begs the question of whether people are wrong about Jase as well.

And to do that, I have to focus my efforts on looking at everyone and putting forth my thoughts and questions, so that if I am lynched, I've hopefully left some valuable insight behind that may help the remaining town figure out the truth.

Which makes it look like part of the scum plan. The thought I'm having is that DX intentionally claimed because of the quickhammer suspicion in such a way that he could both fish for power roles and give his buddy town points by calling him a liar and then flipping scum. That at least explains why DX picked such a wonky claim...specifically so that he'd be lynched after attacking VE. At any rate it's suspicious that he claimed out of the blue and then DX chose him to call out with his fake investigate.

Your choice of hito was an odd one though. I would have expected the confirmed town player to be prioritized over the simple very town looking player. You'll have to explain that one to me when the game is over. Anyways, no there is no possibility whatsoever that the NK wasn't a scum NK because if it was a townshot I would be dead which is why it's a certainty that dry didn't attempt a shot last night. Unless you roleblocked him for some fucking reason and are now curious to know if he was suspicious enough of me to shoot or not. That's a an explanation for that question that I hadn't thought of, but then why block him in the first place? Risk reduction? Just making absolutely sure that if he was suspicious of you enough to kill you got a chance to argue? Probably just more likely that you didn't RB and are faking curiosity to look town I think."}
