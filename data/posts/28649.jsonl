You do. Being thrown in a river after being stabbed in the foot ten times and being suffocated by coins isn't really the best fate to befall a person. But whatever: his death means that you KNOW that someone's been arranging murders. Most of you would go meh and just carry on with your lives, but a few of you have decided to rise up and form a committee! Well, to be exact, 13 of you.  <br>\nOf course, you say, the mafia would take advantage of this: they always do, being the cronies they are. And so an agreement was made: one person would be cast out of the town each day from the committee, in the rather silly hope that they would be a member of the local mafia. <br>\nHey, good luck.

Votes must be bolded, and be placed in the format <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: Terra</div>.<br>\n2. Days will have a deadline of two weeks. Deadline can be extended/shortened under certain circumstances, to my discretion. <br>\n3. Factions cannot talk during the day(i.e. mafia, neighbors, masons) unless specifically stated otherwise. <br>\n4. Do not, under any circumstances, communicate with a player outside the game thread regarding the game, unless specifically stated otherwise in your Role PM. <br>\n5. Do not, under any circumstances, quote any PM sent to you by me in the thread or otherwise. <br>\n6. Absolutely no invisible, small, or otherwise unreadable text. Spoiler tags are allowed as long as the nature of their contents are clearly labeled.<br>\n7. You will be prodded after failing to post in <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">48</div> hours. If you require a third prod you will instead be force-replaced. Please inform me in-thread of any upcoming V/LA in bold: <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">V/LA Sunday to Saturday</div><br>\n-----7a. If you join this game and flake without posting or requesting a replacement you will be blacklisted, and not allowed to join any more of my games.<br>\n8. &#8220;Bah&#8221; posts are allowed, but can not include any kind of game-related information. However, lynched players may continue to talk during Twlight.<br>\n9. Twilight occurs after the hammer and before the lynch scene. You may continue to talk, but any new votes/unvotes will not be counted.<br>\n-----9a. \"No Lynch\" occurs when half of the remaining players vote for it. <br>\n10. <div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF0000\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Red</div></div> is my color, don&#8217;t use it.<br>\n-----10a. Italics will be used in flavor. <br>\n11. I will use modkills at my discretion, with or without warnings depending on the severity offense. If you think something may break my rules (or patience), ask me first, or don&#8217;t do it at all. Modkills will either end the day or continue on(with the decision based on what is worse for the offender&#8217;s faction) and turn the killed player into a Neutral Survivor, thus making them lose. <br>\n12. If I make a mistake in some way, point it out by bolding a statement: <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">@MOD: You made a mistake.</div><br>\n13. I reserve the right to add to or change the rules at my discretion. There are no loopholes, and I enforce ex post facto.<br>\n14. Don't be afraid to have fun. Despite the wording of these rules I am not a ruthless dictator and the vast majority of players are not trolls. Good luck! <br>\n-----14a. Also, please Be Civil. Please. Like, seriously, please. <br>\n15. Play to win. I don't care if someone you hate is in your faction: if you throw the game to spite someone or otherwise you will be modkilled and blacklisted.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"font-size: 50%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">On another note, I keep on saying otherwise.</div><br>\n<br>\nHere's an example of the VT role PM, which you know will be given to at least one person:\n<blockquote><div><cite>Me.

Because while drawing conclusions using logic and evidence is the foundation of the game, leapin wildly to them is incredibly counter-productive. Observe the absurdly premature clearing of Hoopla by monkeyman. Hoopla's attitude conforms to a certain Townish perspective, but it is by no means strong enough to clear him. It disregards to fact that Hoopla is highly experienced and clever, and quite capable of faking a mild Town-tell. Monkeyman has leapt wildly to a conclusion, which has the possibility of allowing scum to skate by on a free Townread.<br>\n<br>\nAsking stupid and obvious questions will not redirect attention from your eyebrow-raising overreaction to being voted.", "time": "Sun May 26, 2013 6:47 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=28649&start=50", "forum": "53", "thread": "28649"}

Another interesting line from #77 is; \"So why the concerted effort to try to misrep my post, Zionite?\" Again, another question is presented without assuming a stance.

I don't like the feel I'm getting from Chenoan, it's not genuine and I don't see the basic thought process I would expect from a townie. He keeps mentioning that Monkey is not addressing the cases against him, but he doesn't present them to Monkey.

I hadn't read anything by you so I think your response to pressure is fair game. If you want to rationalize why I shouldn't do so, you can (I see that you do this in 181. Fair do).

I don't feeling like you are acting pro-town, you're more concerned with staying out of suspicion than catching scum. The way you leap to defend yourself with logic that doesn't make sense is incredibly scummy. Can you read your posts to yourself before posting them?

Asking for votes and \"pushing a BS wagon\" are two completely different things. Note how at the start of the game Hoopla was asking for more votes on me (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4981861#p4981861\">#39</a>), this is the same thing as what Monkey was doing. They were just asking for more votes for pressure. The fact that you misrepped Monkey's push for votes as \"pushing a BS wagon\" just reiterates that your cases are nonsensical, you're using poor reasoning and you're not trying to scumhunt. I'm not trying to defend Monkey, I just find that scums generally use poor reasoning to support their votes because they're actually not trying to scumhunt. <br>\n<br>\nThe way you extensively fence-sit on two stances and the lack of a clear hypothesis on all of your posts just reminds me of an artificial shell trying to emulate the thoughts of a townie. There are many games where townies ignore arguments that they don't find reasonable or logical e.g. <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2088014#p2088014\" class=\"postlink\">http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.ph ... 4#p2088014</a> please stop using this as a sole reasoning for a scumread, it just shows a lack of effort on your part.", "time": "Thu May 30, 2013 7:37 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=28649&start=225", "forum": "53", "thread": "28649"}

All you've been doing this game is telling people who are voting the same person as you that you \"love\" them and some other anti-productive mumbo jumbo.", "time": "Sat Jun 01, 2013 5:13 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=28649&start=250", "forum": "53", "thread": "28649"}

The motivation is that you basically have an excuse to jump on any wagon you want, whereas if you gave out townreads, it is harder for scums to backpeddle and jump on wagons on people you gave townreads to since this looks suspicious.<br>\n<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4999242#p4999242\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4999242#p4999242\" data-post-id=\"4999242\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 261</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=19927\">jmo16mla</a> wrote:</cite>I thought you said earlier that people's play styles change anyways, didnt you?</div></blockquote>\nI didn't say that, please point out where I said that. Not to mention a big change like yours is definitely not pro-town. What I said about Chenoan's case is that people's play styles usually remain the same regardless of whether they are scum or town because they are trying to act town, so it is natural that most people would have most of the same habits if they were scum as if they were town. Which is why Chenoan's meta couldn't help him. Your drastic change in play however can be used as a scumtell because you've lied about \"typically\" not giving out townreads (we've already proved this, so stop defending this), and you've also changed from a pro-town play style to one that is anti-town and non-contributive.<br>\n<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5000793#p5000793\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5000793#p5000793\" data-post-id=\"5000793\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 292</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=19927\">jmo16mla</a> wrote:</cite>You. aren't. scum. hunting.<br>\n<br>\nYou're not pressuring anyone.</div></blockquote>\nThis is hilariously ironic. You've already admitted that \"your case on Monkey is not strong\" yet you are staying on an L-1 wagon that looks like it will hammer Monkey anytime soon.

Here Monkey is lynched D1 as scum after fakeclaiming Cop when he reached L-1.<br>\n<br>\nPrior to this, Monkey had actually been lynched D1 as a Cop twice in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&amp;t=12181\" class=\"postlink\">Mini 838</a> and <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&amp;t=11507\" class=\"postlink\">Mini 795</a>. <br>\n<br>\nHis first D1 lynch as a VT occurs in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&amp;t=13390\" class=\"postlink\">Mini 922</a> where he fakeclaims a PR D1, and then takes it back and trueclaims VT when he is on the precipice of being lynched.<br>\n<br>\nThose games all happened within the 09-10 bracket, as he appeared to take a vacation from the site, and only regularly started playing mafia 2012, so we have two different patches of time I'm working with here.<br>\n<br>\n--<br>\n<br>\nSince 2012, Monkey has registered a few more D1 lynches. Frustratingly, none of those were as vanilla, as he appears to have a habit of being lynched as scum or a town PR. <br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&amp;t=21340\" class=\"postlink\">Mini 1317</a> - Bodyguard<br>\n<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&amp;t=23503\" class=\"postlink\">Mini 1382</a> - Mafia 2-Shot JoAT (claims JoAT)<br>\n<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=23948\" class=\"postlink\">Mini 1394</a> - Mafia Goon (claims VT)<br>\n<br>\n--<br>\n<br>\nNow, there's a lot of information there, and although we're missing a sample of VT claims, I've noticed a few interesting things. <br>\n<br>\nFirstly, you can sort of see Monkey's understanding of escaping the noose develop. In his early games, he expresses the belief more than once about VT claims usually being disbelieved and lynched. I think this is the reason he went for the Cop fakeclaim in Mini 892. It's also the reason he decided to fake a powerrole as VT in Mini 922, as per his explanation here:<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=2123217#p2123217\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=2123217#p2123217\" data-post-id=\"2123217\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 568</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10332\">MonkeyMan576</a> wrote:</cite>Oh, and I'm actually a <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">vanilla townie</div>.  I lied because vanilla townie claims usually get lynched for being not useful anyways.   I wasn't taking leads from Reck at all, and my flip will prove it.  I wouldn't blame the town for lynching me because of the time left, but if you think you can get Sakuko or Lowell, especially, I would try.</div></blockquote>\n\nThis mindset seems prevalent in his early games. In his more recent games (1317 and 1382 specifically), his tactics seem to change a bit, where he softclaims a PR before he gets too many votes in 1317 and then claims once people wagon him for that. In 1382 he claims without someone declaring intent to hammer - just as soon as the sixth vote comes down. This seems a lot more survival-based, and ultimately neither claim work.<br>\n<br>\nIf it just stopped there, this would appear like decent evidence that Monkey is town, indicating that as scum he's a lot more likely to try and fakeclaim a PR to escape the D1 lynch, but it seems like he's figured out that doesn't always work and sometimes a VT claim is more convincing. In 1394, his most recent 'lynched D1 game', he pulls out a VT claim as scum.<br>\n<br>\nTo me, the sample here is probably inconclusive - it appears Monkey's ideology is shifting, as he's developing a more nuanced approach to D1 claiming, so it seems foolish to make reads off this information.<br>\n<br>\nHOWEVER, the other thing I noticed that appears to have a much stronger correlation over time is that Monkey throwing out vague threats or half-assed accusations as scum when he claims. For example;<br>\n<br>\nFakeclaiming as Mafia JoAT in 1382 and as Mafia Goon in 1394:<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4371784#p4371784\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4371784#p4371784\" data-post-id=\"4371784\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 152</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10332\">MonkeyMan576</a> wrote:</cite>I'm the town jack of all trades.<br>\n<br>\nRight now my top scumreads are Empking and Johhog.<br>\n<br>\nNotch is right that their argument is stupid, but everything around that argument reeks of scum.</div></blockquote>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4503161#p4503161\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4503161#p4503161\" data-post-id=\"4503161\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 320</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10332\">MonkeyMan576</a> wrote:</cite>I'm a vanilla townie.  Lynch me at your own risk.</div></blockquote>\n\nDoes that second one seem familiar? (Hint: Look at post 287 in this game)<br>\n<br>\nEven in the game where he's faking a PR as a VT, he uses the same tactic:<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=2121027#p2121027\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=2121027#p2121027\" data-post-id=\"2121027\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 471</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10332\">MonkeyMan576</a> wrote:</cite>I'm a <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Jack of all Trades</div> you'd better not lynch me...</div></blockquote>\n\nWhereas, in games as Cop or his Bodyguard game, he usually just goes \"Well, I'm the Cop\" as does nothing after the claim. No threats or accusations.  When he <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3919154#p3919154\" class=\"postlink\">trueclaims Bodyguard in 1317</a> game he's very stoic and even apologetic. <br>\n<br>\n--<br>\n<br>\nI think the most convincing thing is the word for word replica of his fakeclaim in 1394. I'm willing to hammer him on that alone, and the other evidence while less conclusive hints at a pattern that is supportive or at least doesn't refute my beliefs. As an aside, I noticed Monkey tended to be more overarching and absolute in his reads and accusations as scum - this is something I thought was weird early in the game when he claimed I was town.

His lazy play doesn't seem like bussing to me, so I don't pick him for scum if Monkey is, though.<br>\n- I'd also consider Zionite a suspect if Monkey is town. He coyly nursed his way onto the Monkey wagon citing a pressure vote (pressure votes don't work like that when you say beforehand it's pressure) and he hasn't really done anything to update his stance or see what came of the wagon after his pressure vote. I've been feeling uneasy about him for a little while, but don't really know why beyond that. Just wanted to make that known before we close the thread.<br>\n- I feel like ac1983fan's slip up where he found his predecessor scummy to actually be kinda town. Probably wifoming myself here, but I think scum are likelier to be more alert when entering a game; analysing the state of play/seeing who is a safe target/seeing how their buddies are doing etc. It's likelier that a townie would jump in guns blazing and pick out posts that appear suspect. That sloppiness seems town.<br>\n- If Monkey's scum, I'm not vibing busses. I'd be more inclined to look at less active players who've avoided commenting on Monkey or pushed alternate wagons.

{"number": 363, "id": "5011732", "user": "Chevre", "user_id": "13058", "content": "Initially I was going to chide Hoopla for lynching so soon. I mean, even as I make this post the D1 deadline has not passed. I had questions on the table that had not been answered, and I had not had a chance to read Hoopla's case on MonkeyMan576. That being said, Hoopla's findings + MonkeyMan576's late-day play make me less incensed about it.<br>\n<br>\nI don't know if nightkill analysis is kosher, but I believe that Zionite is an obvious scum kill. I found him very town, and his joining the MonkeyMan576 wagon was honestly part of the reason why I voted him too. Keybladewielder does read pretty clearly as a vig kill given the suspicion on him and his status as the second-highest wagon. So yes, I do think diabolik's immediate assumption that there was a serial killer was very strange. However, from my perspective I can see why one would do that: Diabolik had just replaced in the game, so he may not have realized how suspicious Keybladewielder was, and I think there is something kind of enticing about the town having to deal with a serial killer as well.<br>\n<br>\nThat being said, Diabolik's reads after reading the whole game are lacking. Also, having Hoopla as his main townread is really strange. I mean, Hoopla isn't really one of my top suspects, but she isn't a pinnacle of townness either.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Diabolik</div>, I'm excited to see cases on Nul and mario and lugi. <br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5008938#p5008938\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5008938#p5008938\" data-post-id=\"5008938\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 334</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5619\">ac1983fan</a> wrote:</cite>Voting <div style=\"display:inline;color:#00FF00\">MonkeyMan576</div>-Chenoan, jmo16mla,<div style=\"display:inline;color:#00FF00\">Keybladewielder</div>, <div style=\"display:inline;color:#00FF00\">Zionite</div>, Chevre, mario and lugi, Hoopla(LYNCH)<br>\nVoting enomis- Diabolik(L-6)<br>\nVoting Chenoan-Nul(L-6)<br>\nVoting <div style=\"display:inline;color:#00FF00\">Keybladewielder</div>-<div style=\"display:inline;color:#00FF00\">ac1983fan</div>, Elyse, <div style=\"display:inline;color:#00FF00\">MonkeyMan576</div>(L-4)<br>\nVoting <div style=\"display:inline;color:#00FF00\">ac1983fan</div>-enomis(L-6)<br>\nI think there is likely one scum among Cheno, jmo, Chev, and M&amp;L.<br>\n<br>\nI'm a little weary about Hoopla at the mo'.

But then again I did see him as a pretty strong town D1 so meh, could just be paranoia.<br>\n<br>\nRereading is necessary.</div></blockquote>\n\nThis post is really strange. ac1983fan suggests that there is likely scum on the MonkeyMan576 lynch, an opinion which I agree with, but look at the way he does it. He lists the living players of the wagon, except Hoopla, who is given a paragraph of somewhat suspicious findings and a wishy-washy ending.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">ac1983fan</div>, can you rationalize this? Why is Hoopla not in that list, despite being a member of the MonkeyMan576 lynch?<br>\n<br>\nenomis having to re-emphasize that he found Elyse's reaction scummy and that everyone should vote her in 343, right after he focused a post on it in 342, is really weird.<br>\n<br>\nElyse, I think your claim that Hoopla should've been nightkilled actually had some merit, though I didn't see it at first. Looking at games from 2012 on her wiki, her dying on Night 1 is something that happens quite often, but it is by no means a universal thing. Also, I reiterate that, in my eyes, Hoopla's play on Day 1 didn't look very town at all.<br>\n<br>\nIn my opinion, Diabolik's claim is a bad play, but I think it's worth not lynching him today. He can use his figurative power tonight and then if he is alive tomorrow, we get a full claim and deal with it from there. I may reconsider if we don't get those cases he promised.<br>\n<br>\nDespite rereading, Chenoan did not recognize Nul's vote as a continuation of his hard push on jmo16mla yesterday. I think that's really weird.<br>\n<br>\nIn conclusion for now, I'm feeling a lot of minor suspicions but not anything I feel as strongly about as I did MonkeyMan576. I did vote Chenoan yesterday, but I like how he defended against everything and while his play so far today isn't the greatest in my eyes, it isn't terrible either. If I had to cast a vote it would be on jmo16mla: Nul's case has a lot of merit, and he was on the MonkeyMan576 lynch wagon, which he joined in a very slick fashion:<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4985982#p4985982\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4985982#p4985982\" data-post-id=\"4985982\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 109</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=19927\">jmo16mla</a> wrote:</cite><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: monkey man</span><br>\n<br>\nThe above post has town vibes.</div></blockquote>\n\nThe \"above post\" referenced is a one liner by enomis in which he questions mario and lugi.

All you did was nitpick words you didn't like. Your play is atrocious in terms of being pro-town. Here is why I think you're scummy:<br>\n<br>\n1. Your meta shows you give out town reads in more than half your games, thus you lied about, quoted; \"I typically don't give out townreads\".<br>\n2. Your change in mentality looks to me like you are keeping wagons open by not giving out townreads.<br>\n3. In one of the examples, you gave out townreads because someone softclaimed in their first few posts. This only shows how lenient you were in giving out townreads which is a big contrast to this game, especially for someone that claims, quoted; \"everyone is scum until proven otherwise\".<br>\n4. You've made a drastic change in playstyle which is scummy.<br>\n5. You admitted your case on Monkey was weak, yet you stayed on an L-1 wagon and didn't do anything in terms of pressuring, prodding or questioning.<br>\n6. You said, quoted; \"it's too early to lynch someone\" in #170, yet you stayed on the L-1 wagon.<br>\n7. In #204 you said your vote was for \"pressure\" not \"lynch\", yet there was no forms of scumhunting done by you after post #204. Instead you stayed on the wagon, thus lynching Monkey.<br>\n8. Not addressing valid cases on you and being very short, vague with your defence.<br>\n9. You haven't been scumhunting, like at all.<br>\n10. Contradictory play and being non-contributive in general. Telling people that you \"love them\" for voting the same person as you are just comes off to me as subconscious buddying.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n@Chenoan, read <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4996684#p4996684\">#242</a>. My vote wasn't a random vote, I just wanted to see how he would react but I've already told you guys I have scumreads on Jmo already. Seriously, you are picking up on useless things and I don't like how you are ignoring the cases that were made against you in D1 by pretending to be oblivious.<br>\n<br>\nThe way you keep giving out lists of reads is scummy as hell. I don't think it is something a town would do, it just looks like you are trying really hard to pretend like you are contributing content. Your list of reads doesn't help us at all and just serves as a kill list for mafia. <br>\n<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4845977#p4845977\" class=\"postlink\">http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.ph ... 7#p4845977</a> <br>\n<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4851863#p4851863\" class=\"postlink\">http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.ph ... 3#p4851863</a><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n@Chevre, you're scummy because I don't like any of the content you've presented thus far. Many of the questions you ask are pointless and lead nowhere in terms of scumhunting e.g. #141, #212 it just seems to me like you are trying really hard to look busy especially the way you try to address every single player in the game in most of your posts instead of just the people you have scumreads on. You also casted a vote on Monkey then pretty much disappeared for the rest of D1 until someone mentioned a scumread on you, this is scummy. I don't like it when people leave votes and disappear instead of pursuing them, it feels like you are trying to dodge questions if people ask for reasoning on your vote.", "time": "Fri Jun 07, 2013 5:37 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=28649&start=375", "forum": "53", "thread": "28649"}

You said \"everyone is scum until proven otherwise\", how is soft claiming townie in the first post evidence of anything?

Not to mention a big change like yours is definitely not pro-town. What I said about Chenoan's case is that people's play styles usually remain the same regardless of whether they are scum or town because they are trying to act town, so it is natural that most people would have most of the same habits if they were scum as if they were town. Which is why Chenoan's meta couldn't help him. Your drastic change in play however can be used as a scumtell because you've lied about \"typically\" not giving out townreads (we've already proved this, so stop defending this), and you've also changed from a pro-town play style to one that is anti-town and non-contributive.<br>\n<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5000793#p5000793\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5000793#p5000793\" data-post-id=\"5000793\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 292</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=19927\">jmo16mla</a> wrote:</cite>You. aren't. scum. hunting.<br>\n<br>\nYou're not pressuring anyone.</div></blockquote>\nThis is hilariously ironic.

If you typically don't give out townreads, then you wouldn't have a bunch of games where you actually did give out townreads. I think you are the one that doesn't understand the word typical.<br>\n<br>\nIt's not an idiotic motivation but whatever, the point is you've lied about your meta and your playstyle has changed from your normal one. You're being very reluctant to give out townreads in this game and this is completely different from how you usually play.", "time": "Sat Jun 08, 2013 3:39 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=28649&start=375", "forum": "53", "thread": "28649"}

Nice.</div></blockquote>\nMy case is on how anti-town your play is (not scumhunting, flaky defence, being overly critical of suspicion on you) and also on how your play in this game has changed drastically from your usual town meta. It's already been proven that you in fact do \"typically\" give out townreads, (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5015155#p5015155\">#391</a>), yet you keep using wordplay and logical fallacies to defend yourself, for example when I showed you the games where you gave out townreads exceeding the games you don't, all you say is \"typically, can't you read the word\". Also when I said your motives are so that you can easily hop around on wagons, all you kept saying was \"what is my motivation to do that, etc\", you are being very dodgy with your answers and you are trying to get into a debate on things that do no matter (definition of words) and divert the accusations against you instead of answering them directly.<br>\n<br>\nThis is shown in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4991034#p4991034\">#173</a> when I asked you if you would be happy with a Monkey lynch right now, you kept dodging my question saying things like \"it depends on how he reacts etc\". Then when I tried to present the question where you are forced to make a choice; \"would you stay on the Monkey wagon if it hit L-1\", you replied \"your question can be found in my last post\" when it actually couldn't be. This seems to me like you are very reluctant to give direct answers to questions, choosing to give half-answers that diverts away from what is actually being asked.<br>\n<br>\nYour mentality of people having to prove themselves as town instead you proving them to be scum is another reason why I find you scummy. You do not want to make an effort to scumhunt and rather hide behind a wagon and let people fight it out (evident by your lack of pressuring/questioning Monkey). I also don't like the way you keep trying to misrepresent my case saying things like \"your whole case is based on the townreads, does townreads matter that much to you, do you want me to give some townreads, etc\", my case has nothing to do with townreads, townreads are only involved because it is your change in meta that we are talking about. I am pretty sure you know this because I've been repeating it over and over again throughout the game that it is your <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">change in playstyle from your town meta</div> that is scummy. Not the fact that you don't give out townreads.

I didn't wait for every single person to comment because I don't like faffing about and delaying the inevitable. It kills momentum and interest in the game, imo.<br>\n<br>\n~~<br>\n<br>\nDiabolik's claim is weird. It comes directly after being accused of being an SK. That could be weird newbie paranoia making him overcompensate and claim vig thinking he'd just been caught, when in reality it was just a casual aside. The thing that makes me think it's town is the meta-specific nature of his claim. 2-Shot Vigs are very commonly used by the normal reviewers for balance reasons, and I wouldn't expect Diabolik to know that given his command of English. It's more likely to me, that's his actual role rather than it being a weird coincidental claim that fits with mini normal meta. <br>\n<br>\n~~<br>\n<br>\nNul is killing it this game. I agree with his case on jmo in post 377 and jmo's flailing defenses have barely done anything to address Nul at all. I also agree with his concerns about Chevre narrating the game instead of scumhunting.

What do you mean \"but I was going to try something different\"? Are you saying that you changed your playstyle intentionally in this game?

How can you change your playstyle intentionally when you didn't even realised you played a certain way.<br>\n<br>\nI would like some clarification on \"obviously that's not very town like\", you've quite clearly admitted that your playstyle this game has been anti-town, but are you saying that you purposefully changed your playstyle to one that is anti-town?<br>\n<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5020675#p5020675\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5020675#p5020675\" data-post-id=\"5020675\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 448</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=19927\">jmo16mla</a> wrote:</cite>It's not.

You and Chenoan are the only ones that have been lacking completely at scumhunting (just ISO yourself). You don't put nearly as much effort into scumhunting as much as you are doing to defend yourself, this is scummy as it shows you prioritise staying alive over finding scum (the only reason for this is because you're scum).

This stops people from finding links between you and certain players. I don't feel that a townie would address everyone rather than just their scumreads, it is also scummy because you do this in almost every single post, if you were actually scumhunting I think you would eventually slim down to a smaller pool of players to concentrate on. I'm not sure if this is just your playstyle but addressing multiple players is a rare practice and just seems to me like trying really hard to obscure your links with players.<br>\n<br>\nI don't feel a genuine town mindset with questions such as in #141 where you asked me whether I would be happy with an enomis lynch, when I wasn't even voting enomis. It was so random and just feels like you are trying to look busy or create fake content. It's like if I suddenly asked Hoopla if she would be happy with an Elyse lynch when Hoopla isn't even voting Elyse. I also didn't like how you asked me \"how did you realise mario's vote was not on you\". I explained it several times throughout the thread and even if you missed it, you could easily read mario's post and figure it out after he said he wasn't voting for me.</div></blockquote>\n\nIf my choosing to keep every player in mind could be scum trying to avoid connections, why is your playstyle of focusing on one or two players not considered distancing from or even bussing scum teammates? At least for me, it's not. It's just the way I do things.<br>\n<br>\nAs for my question about enomis, I asked it because your question felt so very out of left-field. Sure, Doc did place a vote on enomis, but it felt out of place. I guess maybe I was thinking, \"there are so many votes around the same caliber as Doc's, why choose to question him?\" Thus, I felt you should be capable of answering the same question. It's not like the situation you present; Hoopla has asked anyone else out of the blue about an Elyse lynch. As for the Nul/Null vote, I just found it really strange how you were able to discern it was an unvote and not a vote for you. Like, if I were you I would've thought differently.<br>\n<br>\nI do agree with your point in 421 about Chenoan lurking though, as I was also waiting for content from him IIRC. <br>\n<br>\nmario and lugi, and Diabolik too I guess, Hoopla hasn't been prodded because it hadn't been 72 hours since the beginning of the day, if I am understanding things correctly. I don't think there is anything to be found in pushing the \"how did Diabolik know Hoopla was active at night\" issue any further.<br>\n<br>\nNul, I guess I was expecting more when he said \"case\", but I guess that's it. Also, I'm sorry you feel that way about my questions, but they are genuine. The Diabolik one has apparently been resolved now, but jmo16mla one is especially interesting, given that he cast a similar vote on MonkeyMan576 on day 1.<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: jmo16mla</span> and questions for him: first, Chenoan vote reasoning. Pleading for people to stop voting you instead of answering questions like that is part of the reason I'm voting you. Second, is \"lynch all liars\" a viable strategy? If you say yes, then you can't really be angry that people are voting you, because you did lie about your playstyle.<br>\n<br>\nI am voting him mostly for the reason I mentioned in 363 about his reasonless MonkeyMan576 vote. The Chenoan vote appears to be in a similar vein. Also, given my townreads so far, the process of elimination is narrowing it down in such a way that it feels impossible for him not to be scum.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">That is L-1, just so everyone knows.</div>", "time": "Mon Jun 10, 2013 3:16 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=28649&start=450", "forum": "53", "thread": "28649"}

Why is Hoopla not in that list, despite being a member of the MonkeyMan576 lynch?</div></blockquote>\nGuess I didn't make this clear; I was looking at Hoopla separately from the rest of the players because I think her actions are a bit unique? I think that, regardless of whether Hoopla is scum, there is one scum among the other players on the wagon. That is, I think there was either one scum not including Hoopla or two scum including Hoopla that were on that wagon. but that's more of a hunch than anything.\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5001742#p5001742\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5001742#p5001742\" data-post-id=\"5001742\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 307</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=13058\">Chevre</a> wrote:</cite>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">ac1983fan</div>, why was MonkeyMan576's defense town?

I think that when players \"throw their hands in the air\" and accept a lynch of themselves on D1, they are usually town.  Scum basically need D1 to be a town lynch and so should be a bit more desparate to not be lynched.

After D1 you say \"<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">role block chenoan</div>\"<br>\n3. Mod says \"<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">you mean role stop?</div>\" (it doesn't make sense for him to give you the wiki link here)<br>\n4.

It is impossible that there was further messages after those 4 seeing as you said quoted; \"<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Then I realized and said nvm, role stop hoopla</div>\".<br>\n<br>\nThat means you didn't know the role properly before you submitted your action, in which case no messages could had occurred before message 2. <br>\n<br>\nAnd since you said \"<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">then I realized</div>\", that means after message 3 where mod says \"<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">you mean role stop?</div>\", you realised your role so in conclusion there couldn't had been any messages sent after message 4 where you changed your action seeing as you realised your role already (you wouldn't message again trying to confirm your role because you \"realized\").", "time": "Wed Jun 12, 2013 6:18 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=28649&start=500", "forum": "53", "thread": "28649"}

The fact that you try to use the playstyle of tunnelling to suggest that I myself could be scummy just intrigues me. You've played on this site for a fair while so you must have noticed that almost all players tunnel on their scumreads. Why are you trying to compare a commonly used playstyle (tunnelling) to yours of addressing every player?</div></blockquote>\n\nWhen I last played, tunnelling was considered a scumread anyway, and I still have my doubts that what you're saying is true. If you could prove the verity of your statement somehow, I guess I could see it. And just because it's more commonly used doesn't make it any less likely to have scum using a similar strategy to buss or distance.<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5032061#p5032061\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5032061#p5032061\" data-post-id=\"5032061\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 545</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=12869\">Nul</a> wrote:</cite>I think it should be noted that Chevre has the least number of posts despite actually being one of the players that are following this game.</div></blockquote>\n\nTo be frank, this is by far the stupidest reason for suspicion on me. It is because I have tended to post less often, less than once a day even, and rarely have they been only a few lines. Your argument is like saying \"I have 20 plastic cups full of water; Chevre has 2 swimming pools full of water. Thus I have more water than Chevre.\" That's probably why I haven't posted recently; in my mind it doesn't feel like there is enough content worth a post of mine.<br>\n<br>\nMy biggest scumread corresponds with my vote in that it is jmo16mla for many reasons I have already mentioned: his fishy MonkeyMan576 vote, his general attitude before his claim, and his late breadcrumb. As I have stated before, I think he is a Mafia Rolestopper who thought he would not need to claim, so he didn't breadcrumb until a page before his claim when his life was on the line. Also, the way the wagon stalled on him makes me think he is scummier. We are not beating around bushes; we have two less than stellar players around here. Seemingly town, to my eyes and others, but if that is the case then we lose for the most part two votes to help us push a Mafia-lynch. Such is what I think has happened here: Diabolik is hopelessly stuck on mario and lugi, and mario and lugi just joined the wagon recently out of nowhere (which I'd like reasoning on, as soon as possible.) Looking at the rest of the votes, that left Chenoan, who has apparently siteflaked, ac1983fan, and enomis to join the wagon. Yet it never happened, and now momentum seems to be switching.<br>\n<br>\nAlong those lines, I think the hem-haw attitude of enomis recently has been very suspicious. For example, look at these quotes:<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5024847#p5024847\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5024847#p5024847\" data-post-id=\"5024847\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 491</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=17285\">enomis</a> wrote:</cite>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: jmo</span> for the time being.

He tends to be narrating the game as opposed to offering any meaningful analysis or insight - that's a fairly reliable scumtell in my eyes. I'm suspicious of Elyse and Chenoan too, but this is largely from process of elimination. Here is how I am seeing the game right now:<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">mario and luigi: <div style=\"display:inline;color:#008000\">town</div></div>. Players like this can't be read in the traditional sense - he is literally on a different plane of existence as far as I'm concerned. The only meaningful insight I've gleaned from his posts is what I talked about in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4986816#p4986816\" class=\"postlink\">post 134</a>. Amongst the nonsense, it makes no sense for him to air concerns about lynching a townie in that manner as scum. It's irrational, but it's town irrationality.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Diabolik: <div style=\"display:inline;color:#008000\">town</div></div>. Like mario, I'm pretty sure he is town based on his unsolicited claim. Two-shot vig is a role the Normal Review Group like to use in Mini Normals. How could he pick up on this metagame subtlety? It's obvious to me he is not at this level of awareness, as evidenced by the fact he thought there was a night 0 this game. It would have to be a pretty lucky fluke to claim a role that syncs up with Mini Normal meta so well. Occams Razor: it's way more likely that this actually is his role.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">jmo16mla:<div style=\"display:inline;color:#008000\"> town</div></div>. I explained my read on the jmo situation yesterday and my thoughts haven't changed. Admittedly my whole town read on him hinges on his claim, but I think that's the most illuminating piece of evidence for his alignment. Too often I've seen people play like jmo as town, that his overall behaviour comes second to his claim. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Nul:<div style=\"display:inline;color:#008000\"> town</div>.</div> In the midst of town apathy and mindless play, Nul has stood up over and over to drive the game forward. He has been logical and active, and while these aren't always town qualities, his reads tend to sync up with mine, and I think his cases have been made in good faith. If he's scum, we're fucked, but this is a pretty low-percentage chance in my mind, so I'm pretty much ignoring this outcome when there are better targets still alive.<br>\n<br>\n~~<br>\n<br>\nWhen I factor in those reads into the Day 1 vote count:<br>\n<br>\n<fieldset style=\"border:3px outset grey;padding:5px 10px\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#008000\">MonkeyMan576</div> - Chenoan, <div style=\"display:inline;color:#008000\">jmo16mla</div>, <div style=\"display:inline;color:#008000\">Keybladewielder</div>,<div style=\"display:inline;color:#008000\"> Zionite</div>, Chevre, <div style=\"display:inline;color:#008000\">mario and lugi</div>, <div style=\"display:inline;color:#008000\">Hoopla</div><br>\nenomis - <div style=\"display:inline;color:#008000\">Diabolik </div><br>\nChenoan - <div style=\"display:inline;color:#008000\">Nul</div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#008000\">Keybladewielder</div> - ac1983fan, Elyse, <div style=\"display:inline;color:#008000\">MonkeyMan576</div><br>\nac1983fan - enomis</fieldset><br>\n<br>\nThe majority of the Monkey wagon is town or is my town read, something fairly damning for Chevre and Chenoan. I find it unlikely that the entire wagon was town. About 18 months ago, I researched Day 1 wagons on town in Mini Normals and over 50 games only two games featured zero scum on the lynch wagon. The majority of cases were two scum, with three scum the next most likely outcome. <br>\n<br>\nI'm not always keen on using probabilistic reasoning like this, but given the wagon was largely reasonless drivel until I placed my hammer, it tarnishes my view of the motivation for the wagon. When a culture of weak or underwhelming votes are tolerated when joining a wagon, it's more likely that scum are okay with abusing the privilege. The Monkey wagon was sloppy and easy to join - there was scum on it. <br>\n<br>\nGiven my previous reads, I'm definitely in favour of lynching Chevre or Chenoan. I'm going to dump my vote on Chevre until I read up more on Chenoan as well as enomis/ac1983/Elyse. I think the scumteam is within these five players.<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Chevre</span>", "time": "Fri Jun 14, 2013 8:19 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=28649&start=550", "forum": "53", "thread": "28649"}

I mean, even as I make this post the D1 deadline has not passed. I had questions on the table that had not been answered, and I had not had a chance to read Hoopla's case on MonkeyMan576. That being said, Hoopla's findings + MonkeyMan576's late-day play make me less incensed about it.<br>\n<br>\nI don't know if nightkill analysis is kosher, but I believe that Zionite is an obvious scum kill. I found him very town, and his joining the MonkeyMan576 wagon was honestly part of the reason why I voted him too. Keybladewielder does read pretty clearly as a vig kill given the suspicion on him and his status as the second-highest wagon. So yes, I do think diabolik's immediate assumption that there was a serial killer was very strange. However, from my perspective I can see why one would do that: Diabolik had just replaced in the game, so he may not have realized how suspicious Keybladewielder was, and I think there is something kind of enticing about the town having to deal with a serial killer as well.<br>\n<br>\nThat being said, Diabolik's reads after reading the whole game are lacking. Also, having Hoopla as his main townread is really strange.

While I thought he was town before, his near-end of the day case on MonkeyMan almost it seems like an extensively well-researched excuse for his last-minute change of opinion on MonkeyMan in order to get his ML through.  But then again I did see him as a pretty strong town D1 so meh, could just be paranoia.<br>\n<br>\nRereading is necessary.</div></blockquote>\n\nThis post is really strange. ac1983fan suggests that there is likely scum on the MonkeyMan576 lynch, an opinion which I agree with, but look at the way he does it. He lists the living players of the wagon, except Hoopla, who is given a paragraph of somewhat suspicious findings and a wishy-washy ending.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">ac1983fan</div>, can you rationalize this? Why is Hoopla not in that list, despite being a member of the MonkeyMan576 lynch?<br>\n<br>\nenomis having to re-emphasize that he found Elyse's reaction scummy and that everyone should vote her in 343, right after he focused a post on it in 342, is really weird.<br>\n<br>\nElyse, I think your claim that Hoopla should've been nightkilled actually had some merit, though I didn't see it at first. Looking at games from 2012 on her wiki, her dying on Night 1 is something that happens quite often, but it is by no means a universal thing. Also, I reiterate that, in my eyes, Hoopla's play on Day 1 didn't look very town at all.<br>\n<br>\nIn my opinion, Diabolik's claim is a bad play, but I think it's worth not lynching him today. He can use his figurative power tonight and then if he is alive tomorrow, we get a full claim and deal with it from there. I may reconsider if we don't get those cases he promised.<br>\n<br>\nDespite rereading, Chenoan did not recognize Nul's vote as a continuation of his hard push on jmo16mla yesterday. I think that's really weird.<br>\n<br>\nIn conclusion for now, I'm feeling a lot of minor suspicions but not anything I feel as strongly about as I did MonkeyMan576. I did vote Chenoan yesterday, but I like how he defended against everything and while his play so far today isn't the greatest in my eyes, it isn't terrible either. If I had to cast a vote it would be on jmo16mla: Nul's case has a lot of merit, and he was on the MonkeyMan576 lynch wagon, which he joined in a very slick fashion:<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4985982#p4985982\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4985982#p4985982\" data-post-id=\"4985982\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 109</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=19927\">jmo16mla</a> wrote:</cite><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: monkey man</span><br>\n<br>\nThe above post has town vibes.</div></blockquote>\n\nThe \"above post\" referenced is a one liner by enomis in which he questions mario and lugi.

Good a place to start as any.<br>\n<br>\nNul's case in #377 gives me a great starting point. I'm going to give a few comments straight off:<br>\n<br>\n1. (In response to 1-4, which are basically all comments stating the same thing) The meta case honestly looks pretty weak to me. I'll be the first to admit that I would probably hold this opinion regardless, since I'm a big follower of meta reads being null tells, but this especially doesn't look very strong to me. Drastic changes in playstyles happen regardless of alignment, and I don't particularly see lack of visible townreads to be scummy in of itself. There's definite town motivation to keep town reads hidden, as scum could make very good use of the town's collective town reads.<br>\n<br>\nEven then, saying he's scum because he gave townreads in another game and says he usually doesn't (which is essentially what he said, btw; his two statement you quoted contradict each other, but it really sounds like a case of bad wording rather than a scum slip in my eyes) doesn't really fit in my eyes.<br>\n<br>\n2. There's merit in comments 5-7 (and 9, actually; all 4 are saying basically the same thing), although again, they are essentially the same point said in different terms. This is definitely worthy of a vote at that point to get more concrete information out of him, but I don't necessarily find him a significant scumread just from this.<br>\n<br>\n3. Eh, really disagree with comment 8.<br>\n<br>\n4. #10 fits in with the first and second sets, although it has enough merit on its own.<br>\n<br>\nAll in all, jmo16mla looks like a solid contender for pressure. I don't think at this point that Nul's pressure or vote are scum-motivated, but enough of his points are a stretch that I'm not really convinced of Jmo's alignment just from this alone.<br>\n<br>\nGoing to cut this post short here so I don't become a hypocrite and make a giant wall.

But from mine, jmo is scum.<br>\nLike he was scummy before his claim, his reaction to Nul's case against him pretty much solidified his scumminess, and while I don't know if he is a rolestopper or not, from <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">my point of view</div>, there's no way he's a <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">pro-town</div> rolestopper.<br>\nIt's not a \"blah\" post, I've been pushing for a jmo lynch since I came back from V/LA. I don't know why he hasn't been lynched yet, I don't know why we have been hopping from player to player, especially when i've had town reads on almost every alternative to lynch for today.  if we're going to keep hopping from player to player we're going to give the scum way too much information about the setup.  That's just how it is, really.<br>\nAnd a majority of people here (yourself included) have suggested sympathy for a jmo lynch at one time or another.  Actually, shit, you were going to hammer him weren't you?<br>\nAlso he's basically coasted by doing nothing since the pressure got off of him.<br>\n<br>\nLook, we have just less than two days to lynch someone, why are we trying to start new wagons?

This kind of blah post\" I dont want another claim today\" doesn't help shit.</div></blockquote>\nWell from your position things look however they do. But from mine, jmo is scum.<br>\nLike he was scummy before his claim, his reaction to Nul's case against him pretty much solidified his scumminess, and while I don't know if he is a rolestopper or not, from <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">my point of view</div>, there's no way he's a <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">pro-town</div> rolestopper.<br>\nIt's not a \"blah\" post, I've been pushing for a jmo lynch since I came back from V/LA. I don't know why he hasn't been lynched yet, I don't know why we have been hopping from player to player, especially when i've had town reads on almost every alternative to lynch for today.  if we're going to keep hopping from player to player we're going to give the scum way too much information about the setup.  That's just how it is, really.<br>\nAnd a majority of people here (yourself included) have suggested sympathy for a jmo lynch at one time or another.  Actually, shit, you were going to hammer him weren't you?<br>\nAlso he's basically coasted by doing nothing since the pressure got off of him.<br>\n<br>\nLook, we have just less than two days to lynch someone, why are we trying to start new wagons? It is unhelpful and anti-town.</div></blockquote>\nLynching town is more anti-town.

Although i am a setup newb, i find the setup still within acceptable range(scum having more powerful roles).Not to mention having a rolestopper is alr wtf. Sometimes, the roles don't make sense unless you see the full setup. Or the miller could be there just as a troll? To misdirect people there is a cop? I don't know.

Nul was directed to the alley behind JMO&#8217;s house as a place of interest. The bullet that made contact with his knee when he got there was less than expected.<br>\n<br>\n&#8220;The owner of that pub doesn&#8217;t take sides. He takes money. Did you really think you could outspend the mafia? That was your second of two strikes. Your first strike was ever investigating this at all. So, as I see it, you have one more strike to give. Answer me this: are you done with your investigation?&#8221;<br>\n<br>\nNul whimpered as he accepted his fate. He was a lot of things, but a coward wasn&#8217;t one of them. Maybe his death would help the town find the culprits responsible for this spree of killings.

Yet, you think this one point, makes her scum instead of her overall play all day which makes her townie.</div></blockquote>\nWow did you even read any of my posts?<br>\nThere's a sole pair of points which make Hoopla look scummy: her sudden reversal at the end of D1 on the Monkey Man wagon and her defense of jmo.  The rest of her game has seemed pretty townie, and I don't know if this is due to her quality as a player or because she is actually town.  Of course there is a possibility Hoopla is not scum - there's a possibility that you're not scum and that neither is M &amp; L and the scumteam is Majiffy and Elyse.  All I know is my own role/alignment.  But I see the game as being a certain way. Moreover I'm not voting Hoopla anymore because I actually don't think Hoopla is the best lynch.", "time": "Thu Jul 04, 2013 10:38 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=28649&start=975", "forum": "53", "thread": "28649"}
