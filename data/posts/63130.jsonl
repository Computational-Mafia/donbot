{"number": 1, "id": "7171036", "user": "Ranmaru", "user_id": "15446", "content": "<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Kat&#8217;s Bingo rules</div>:<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">I. Rule set: Fundamentals</div>:<br>\n1. I am the mod of this game.  Any questions, concerns, and actions for the game are to be directed to Me.  <br>\n2. Please enjoy this game, and do not personally attack other players in a manner that is offensive.<br>\n3. Inactivity in this game is not excusable by activity in other games. <br>\n4. If you believe a simple mod mistake has occurred, please address this in-thread and in bold. If you believe a large moderation mistake has occurred, or you have a dispute, please contact me via PM or IM.<br>\n5. In particular, if I post a vote count that does not accurately reflect your vote, it is your responsibility to correct me -- otherwise your vote may be treated as it appears in the vote count.<br>\n6. You may make ONE BAW post after you have died. This may not contain game relevant information, and if it does, I will edit it out.<br>\n7. No communication about this game is allowed with non-players or players who are dead, even if you yourself are dead. (And if you are dead, you may not discuss the game with anyone who is currently playing, even if you could while you were alive, unless your role specifically states otherwise).<br>\n8. Unless your role PM specifically allows you the power, you are not to communicate with anyone about this game outside of this game thread. If your role PM does allow you this power, you are to PM all conversations to the mod.<br>\n9. Editing your posts is not allowed (if you have the power to). <br>\n10. You are not allowed to quote your role PM or quote a fake role PM. You must paraphrase all information you wish to claim. You are not allowed to post or refer to any images in your role PM, nor may you post metadata about mod PMs in an attempt to break the game (e.g., message ID in the URL, time of day the message was sent, etc.). If you are unsure if your paraphrase crosses the line, ask me via pm.<br>\n11. You must confirm via PM. When confirming via pm to me, read your role pm and summarize it back to me.<br>\n12. Do not post hidden text. (Spoiler tags are allowed because they are easily noticeable. Posting text with the intent to hide it from other players, e.g. by changing the text colour to resemble the page background, is not permitted.)<br>\n13. Do not post in code.<br>\n14. You must post in English.<br>\n15. Hydras are not allowed.<br>\n16. Failure to send in your night action(s) will result in no action(s) being taken unless the action is compulsive; then it will be randomized.<br>\n17.  Any action which would be illegal to actually do is also illegal to fake (for example, posting a made-up PM that shows a Cop result of guilty/innocent).<br>\n18. <div style=\"display:inline;color:#4040FF\">Do not use this (bold + blue) color as it is the mod's color.</div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">II. Voting and Lynching</div>:<br>\n1. Each Day you may vote for a player to be lynched using a bold vote command, e.g. Vote: Crazy<br>\n2. You can unvote, e.g. Unvote: Crazy, which removes your vote from the player you were voting. Unvotes are not necessary before changing votes, but are appreciated.<br>\n3. No lynch is a viable lynch choice, e.g. Vote: No Lynch. A majority voting for this choice will end the Day with no player being lynched.<br>\n4. The Day will end when a majority lynch is decided or a deadline is reached. If a deadline is reached without a majority lynch decided, there will be a no lynch.<br>\n5. No posting at night time, this is not allowed.<br>\n6.  Votes/Unvotes that reasonably follow the guidelines specified above, and are unambiguous with respect to player nicknames/abbreviations, will count.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">III. Activity and Deadline</div>:<br>\n1. You are required to post at least once every 72 hours. You will be prodded otherwise. An accumulation of too many prods (3) will result in your replacement. I will tell you if I'm considering replacing . If you have a pre-planned absence, please notify me ahead of time and you will not be prodded. If your absence is for an unreasonable amount of time, you will be forcibly replaced regardless of advance notification.<br>\n2. A single deadline extension will be granted if a majority of players request this, e.g. Request Deadline Extension. This extension will last only 24 hours. This applies to one game day. I will only grant this once.<br>\n3. Each day will last a period of 2 weeks.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">IV. Game Specific</div>:<br>\n1. All roles are assigned entirely at random.<br>\n2. Jesters, Survivors, Governors, and Politicians are non-existent in this game.<br>\n3. Modkills only end the Day if the player being killed is town-aligned. All other modkills will continue the game. In the event that a player is modkilled during twilight, the modkill will affect the next day phase (meaning that day would automatically end if the player is town and that day would continue as normal if otherwise).<br>\n4. Town win condition: You win when there are no threats to the town remaining and there is at least one town &#8211;aligned player remaining.<br>\n5. I reserve the right to change it at will, and even in extreme circumstances enforce it retroactively. If a strategy feels shady to you, you might want to take it up with me first.<br>\n6.

I wasn't particularly bothered being voted being voted by kyubey, for instance - I felt like his reasoning was understandable but incorrect. I could always plausible understand someone incorrectly scumreading me, if their reasoning made sense.  Your reasoning for that vote, and much of everything you've done, has been tortured to the point of blacking out. It's all based largely on superficial nonsense of \"being useful\" and \"moving things forward\" which is the most superficial of reasoning - you're just looking at how people <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">appear</div> in the game rather than the substance/intent of what  they're actually doing, which shows that you're clearly not reading for actual scum motivation behind posts.

So it goes.<br>\n<br>\nRead on RC has very little to do with Shinobi, much more to do with playstyle and I wouldn't expect you to understand. At the time of the post I wasn't totally solid on my read of him but still felt he didn't seem like scum, I think <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7179330#p7179330\">70</a>-<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7179344#p7179344\">71</a> were decent in that in that he expressed doubt in my reasoning and my actions - it wouldn't really be to his benefit to suddenly turn on me when I was siding with him initially. But moreso than that I just think him having short posts is something that gets scumread by inexperienced players that don't know better.<br>\n<br>\nI do think his most recent post expressing frustration is probably genuine town though, don't think he'd be so overtly antagonistic as scum.<br>\n<br>\nWasn't trying to imply that any of those players were scummy by asking you to read them, I just wanted you to comment on people you hadn't mentioned yet so I could better get a read on you. Agree that Jean's recent posting hasn't been great. Would actually disagree in that I think Lex is the most likely of the 3 to be scum though - get zero sense of legitimate scumhunting from him. Hadn't realized vijay only has 5 posts, not really a lot to go by there, I should have picked someone else.

I agree that he's not being helpful, but to assume this is because he's scum pounding the table raging and refusing to answer, is, well, stoopid. It's very rare for a scum player to demonstrate that sort of hostility/frustration he expresses in his post. You need to try to understand people's thought processes more.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nYeah it doesn't really seem like that's the case.<br>\nBut okay I guess.", "time": "Sat Aug 29, 2015 6:09 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=63130&start=150", "forum": "53", "thread": "63130"}

The conversation just turned to be about him and I'm not sure why and don't feel like looking back (because truthfully that detail isn't important). I think you're blowing things out of proportion massively by claiming him not answering one thing is \"promoting apathy\" when it's been basically one day and most of the players have been inactive regardless.<br>\n<br>\nActually, further than that, it's pretty silly to suggest that \"promoting apathy\" is a tactic used by scum, especially in this instance. He intends to make people not care...by pissing them off? This reasoning doesn't really jive at all. If you thought he was unable to explain his read because it's not real and has no reasoning, I could see someone thinking that - but this as an accusation seems pretty nonsensical to me.<br>\n<br>\nThere's a strong strong difference between not approving of someone's play and thinking they're scum, and you seem to not be picking up on that difference. I want RC to play ball or go home. I don't think he's scum for not doing so, and if anything it's likely to be the opposite - town's far more likely to be obstinate and difficult in most instances, scum are looking to win people's trust.<br>\n<br>\nAs to what I'm hoping to accomplish, well, I wanted to get a read on you and make conversation, try to establish a baseline of understanding. Haven't succeeded at doing the latter, but I'm not that worried, I have time. If you think I'm actually stifling any pressure to get a response from RC, that's dum.

If he's town, scum can follow his lead and act the same way to make it more difficult to catch them later on.  That is anti-town behavior.

Very likely given the timing of what he's said that he's reading things similarly, and overall frustrated tone of his recent posts has me leaning toward him being town. I'm completely willing to re-evaluate if he tries to coast through the game but right now at this moment I don't think it's a worthy read at all.

If they're both innocent, then they both are sure of their innocence. There's also the fact they've both been pretty passionate about their reads of the other, and thats pretty hard to fake without at least one of them actually being innocent. This is good because we can eliminate the option that they're both scum which, while statically speaking is the least likely combination of the two, is something we can't ignore either and is something can help prove both's innocence further down the line. That being said, the 3 remaining combinations (which are Townie/Townie, Scum/Townie, and Townie/Scum) point towards it being more likely for one of them to be scum than for both of them to be innocent, since a probability of 2/3 (both combinations of Townie/Scum) is higher than one of 1/3 (Townie/Townie). <br>\n <br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">The rest of this is pure speculation and assumptions on my part so don't believe anything of it blindly:</div><br>\n<br>\nIm basing the rest of this on the above paragraph, the fact that the majority of votes is split between RC/Shinobi, and that throughout the whole game Catboi/RC and Spiffeh/Shinobi have had the same votes.  <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">I strongly believe that  RC is the bad guys here.</div> I can't say the same of Shinobi/Spiffeh, since both of them weren't as quick to NOT be suspicious of one another, unlike Catboi/RC who've been drawing suspicion of one another while sharing the same vote all game. Catboi explained that he wasn't suspicious of him because he thought they shared the same thought process, mostly because at that point RC was the only person who thought Shinobi was scum. Unless Catboi can give a more compelling reason than \"the way he thinks led him to the same conclusion as me\" for his lower level suspicion towards RC than most other people, then it's pretty damn obvious that RC's the scum.  But even if he gave a good explanation for his trusting, that would just mean he trusts RC, i.e. not strong evidence of RC's innocence. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">New stuff after seeing the news posts:</div><br>\n<br>\nRC could be doing a very clutch play here by doubling down on the outrage of being accused instead of trying to defend himself with solid reason. While normally innocent people would be just as mad as him, we've known he isn't afraid of looking like a giant douche bag for a while now, which means that 1) he isn't acting on an emotional outburst right now and 2) he's entirely capable of thinking up a plan like this. What I'm trying to say here is that we shouldn't use his outrage as proof of his innocence. If he replaces then I'd be more sure of his guilt, since if he were a townnie who truly doesn't enjoy the game he's playing, he would rather be lynched as a townie to screw over town players over just replacing himself with someone who could potentially aid the town players more than himself (which admittedly wouldnt be that hard if that were the case).", "time": "Sun Aug 30, 2015 6:43 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=63130&start=225", "forum": "53", "thread": "63130"}

While I hope the other townies lynch RC, if he turns out to be innocent then not only would Shinobi need to get immediately lynched, but it would also clear Catboi of any scumminess (at least from my POV). That being said, since Shinobi would be cleared if RC ends up scum, then Catboi has to be the next suspect due to it being more likely for one of Shinobi/Catboi to be scum than both of theming innocent. I wouldn't auto-lynch Catboi though, since he could very well just be affected by the confirmation bias that RC gave him by agreeing with him. Oh and if I die after the first night then you guys need to be completely suspicious of everything Catboi says and lynch him as soon as he can't justify a vote with a solid argument.

No condescending remark, no unnecessary comments, and you actually explained your reasoning to me. I think we're both disagreeing in some of the facts because we're interpreting one very important thing differently. While you believe that RC had an emotional outburst; I believe that his actions were calculated. Why? Well:<br>\n<br>\n1) He'd been nothing but unhelpful and rude well before his \"emotional outburst\". Everyone, even you if I remember correctly, agreed that at the very least his actions were anti-town. I know everyone likes to parrot \"anti-town does not = scum\", but actions that are anti-town should be seen as at least a very reasonable cause of suspicion. Your defending of him right after I started suspecting him is what triggered my alarms, but now that I think about, I can see that drawing a connection between you two was probably hasty on my part and I apologize for that.<br>\n<br>\n2) When he had his \"emotional outburst\" none of his comments or the way he treated us were out of line with what he had said earlier. He was a douchebag all game. So when I saw his meltdown, I didn't think I should take it at face value without some evidence to back it up. Since he kept being unhelpful to me, and you quickly took his actions as proof of innocence, your defending of him was something that I took as proof of guilt.<br>\n<br>\nI actually think all of this mess can be settled if we discuss and agree on the following:<br>\n<br>\nIs it not wise to keep in perspective that that RC could be entirely capable of planning his outrage in advance considering the fact that there wasn't any real change in his behavior until it looked like the only way to get some heat off him? I mean he was disrespectful and claimed to not care about this game (long before his \"outburst\"), but then quickly tried to be helpful just before his douchey attitude was about to get him lynched.<br>\n<br>\nCan you blame me for believing any of this?

While I hope the other townies lynch RC, if he turns out to be innocent then not only would Shinobi need to get immediately lynched, but it would also clear Catboi of any scumminess (at least from my POV). That being said, since Shinobi would be cleared if RC ends up scum, then Catboi has to be the next suspect due to it being more likely for one of Shinobi/Catboi to be scum than both of theming innocent. I wouldn't auto-lynch Catboi though, since he could very well just be affected by the confirmation bias that RC gave him by agreeing with him. Oh and if I die after the first night then you guys need to be completely suspicious of everything Catboi says and lynch him as soon as he can't justify a vote with a solid argument.

Everyone, even you if I remember correctly, agreed that at the very least his actions were anti-town. I know everyone likes to parrot \"anti-town does not = scum\", but actions that are anti-town should be seen as at least a very reasonable cause of suspicion. Your defending of him right after I started suspecting him is what triggered my alarms, but now that I think about, I can see that drawing a connection between you two was probably hasty on my part and I apologize for that.<br>\n<br>\n2) When he had his \"emotional outburst\" none of his comments or the way he treated us were out of line with what he had said earlier. He was a douchebag all game. So when I saw his meltdown, I didn't think I should take it at face value without some evidence to back it up. Since he kept being unhelpful to me, and you quickly took his actions as proof of innocence, your defending of him was something that I took as proof of guilt.<br>\n<br>\nI actually think all of this mess can be settled if we discuss and agree on the following:<br>\n<br>\nIs it not wise to keep in perspective that that RC could be entirely capable of planning his outrage in advance considering the fact that there wasn't any real change in his behavior until it looked like the only way to get some heat off him? I mean he was disrespectful and claimed to not care about this game (long before his \"outburst\"), but then quickly tried to be helpful just before his douchey attitude was about to get him lynched.<br>\n<br>\nCan you blame me for believing any of this? I don't have a problem not believing any of this, since if Im proven wrong then I would move on to be suspicious of someone like Shinobi who would look pretty bad if RC turned out to be innocent.</div></blockquote>You're really stretching very hard to justify this and it's looking very much like you're making a case because you want him to be scum rather than because he's actually been scummy.<br>\n<br>\nNo I don't remotely think he planned his outburst, as it would be remarkably poor strategy as scum to draw lots of negative attention to oneself right away to begin a game, and frankly I still empathize with him because a large percentage of the playerlist has been frustratingly obtuse and difficult to deal with. I get the sense that RC is an abrasive, emotional player which makes the whole outburst seem genuine. The idea that he was trying to be \"helpful\" willfully glosses over the fact that he put himself at L-1. Very few players are brave enough to pull off that sort of gambit as scum and the fact is it was unlikely to work here. You have to absolutely be reaching in order to see his play as some sort of scum plan<br>\n<br>\nA quick glimpse of RC's meta shows he's prone to making short posts with very little explanation as town while being abrasive when pushed on as can be seen <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?t=62114&amp;f=2&amp;st=0&amp;sk=t&amp;sd=a&amp;user_select%5B%5D=20971&amp;user_select%5B%5D=0&amp;user_select%5B%5D=0&amp;user_sort=Go\" class=\"postlink\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?t=62176&amp;f=50&amp;st=0&amp;sk=t&amp;sd=a&amp;user_select%5B%5D=20971&amp;user_select%5B%5D=0&amp;user_select%5B%5D=0&amp;user_sort=Go\" class=\"postlink\">here</a> he even references selfvoting in the latter game though he doesn't actually do so) so the stuff you're attacking him on is alignment neutral at best and really picking a fight with half the players in the game on day 1 makes no sense whatsoever as scum play.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">@vijay</div> - I don't even know how to begin to address your post but what Scorpious is referencing is an ongoing game we're both in (he's dead, I'm not) and that's primarily the source of his awkwardness in commenting on me.

Shinobi's basis for his reads have been based on extremely shallow premises, and he's been trying to lynch people for not explaining their reads, but is unwilling to explain his own reads when pressed to do so. It's a contradictory stance, and his sarcasm/dismissiveness in response from him doesn't make sense coming from town - at this point he should either be trying to reason with me, or he thinks i'm scum and trying to get him lynched (and that's clearly not the case). But snarky responses like <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7185635#p7185635\">234</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7185683#p7185683\">238</a> effectively just shut down communication and serve to dismiss my arguments in people's minds. If \"unexplained reads\" were legitimately a scumtell for him he'd do the best he could to explain his, but he's adamantly against this whenever I try to press him for reasoning. (i also get a sense he doesn't really believe this is a tell).<br>\n<br>\nRegardless he's held largely static reads throughout the game, only essentially backing off on me because I proved to be too much to handle. I don't think a read of who is \"useful\" or not is a.) a good basis for a scumread or b.) something you can plausibly decide within 3 pages of a game. It seems contrived, like he's just looking for people to fit in a particular box that has very little to do with whether or not they're town or scum. And that's all he's really said about it, if you read him.<br>\n<br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7185824#p7185824\">241</a> is a bland suck-up response, actually. It's the post scum make when they see town applying effort it - give a vague compliment and move on.
