Rule set: Fundamentals</span>:<br>1. I am the mod of this game.  Any questions, concerns, and actions for the game are to be directed to Me.  <br>2. Please enjoy this game, and do not personally attack other players in a manner that is offensive.<br>3. Inactivity in this game is not excusable by activity in other games. <br>4. If you believe a simple mod mistake has occurred, please address this in-thread and in bold. If you believe a large moderation mistake has occurred, or you have a dispute, please contact me via PM or IM.<br>5. In particular, if I post a vote count that does not accurately reflect your vote, it is your responsibility to correct me -- otherwise your vote may be treated as it appears in the vote count.<br>6. You may make ONE BAW post after you have died. This may not contain game relevant information, and if it does, I will edit it out.<br>7. No communication about this game is allowed with non-players or players who are dead, even if you yourself are dead. (And if you are dead, you may not discuss the game with anyone who is currently playing, even if you could while you were alive, unless your role specifically states otherwise).<br>8. Unless your role PM specifically allows you the power, you are not to communicate with anyone about this game outside of this game thread. If your role PM does allow you this power, you are to PM all conversations to the mod.<br>9. Editing your posts is not allowed (if you have the power to). <br>10. You are not allowed to quote your role PM or quote a fake role PM. You must paraphrase all information you wish to claim. You are not allowed to post or refer to any images in your role PM, nor may you post metadata about mod PMs in an attempt to break the game (e.g., message ID in the URL, time of day the message was sent, etc.). If you are unsure if your paraphrase crosses the line, ask me via pm.<br>11. You must confirm via PM. When confirming via pm to me, read your role pm and summarize it back to me.<br>12. Do not post hidden text. (Spoiler tags are allowed because they are easily noticeable. Posting text with the intent to hide it from other players, e.g. by changing the text colour to resemble the page background, is not permitted.)<br>13. Do not post in code.<br>14. You must post in English.<br>15. Hydras are not allowed.<br>16. Failure to send in your night action(s) will result in no action(s) being taken unless the action is compulsive; then it will be randomized.<br>17.  Any action which would be illegal to actually do is also illegal to fake (for example, posting a made-up PM that shows a Cop result of guilty/innocent).<br>18. <span style=\"color: #4040FF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Do not use this (bold + blue) color as it is the mod's color.</span></span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">II. Voting and Lynching</span>:<br>1. Each Day you may vote for a player to be lynched using a bold vote command, e.g. Vote: Crazy<br>2. You can unvote, e.g. Unvote: Crazy, which removes your vote from the player you were voting. Unvotes are not necessary before changing votes, but are appreciated.<br>3. No lynch is a viable lynch choice, e.g. Vote: No Lynch. A majority voting for this choice will end the Day with no player being lynched.<br>4. The Day will end when a majority lynch is decided or a deadline is reached. If a deadline is reached without a majority lynch decided, there will be a no lynch.<br>5. No posting at night time, this is not allowed.<br>6.  Votes/Unvotes that reasonably follow the guidelines specified above, and are unambiguous with respect to player nicknames/abbreviations, will count.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">III. Activity and Deadline</span>:<br>1. You are required to post at least once every 72 hours. You will be prodded otherwise. An accumulation of too many prods (3) will result in your replacement. I will tell you if I'm considering replacing . If you have a pre-planned absence, please notify me ahead of time and you will not be prodded. If your absence is for an unreasonable amount of time, you will be forcibly replaced regardless of advance notification.<br>2. A single deadline extension will be granted if a majority of players request this, e.g. Request Deadline Extension. This extension will last only 24 hours. This applies to one game day. I will only grant this once.<br>3. Each day will last a period of 2 weeks.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">IV. Game Specific</span>:<br>1. All roles are assigned entirely at random.<br>2. Jesters, Survivors, Governors, and Politicians are non-existent in this game.<br>3. Modkills only end the Day if the player being killed is town-aligned. All other modkills will continue the game. In the event that a player is modkilled during twilight, the modkill will affect the next day phase (meaning that day would automatically end if the player is town and that day would continue as normal if otherwise).<br>4. Town win condition: You win when there are no threats to the town remaining and there is at least one town \u2013aligned player remaining.<br>5. I reserve the right to change it at will, and even in extreme circumstances enforce it retroactively. If a strategy feels shady to you, you might want to take it up with me first.<br>6. The setup is closed."}

Of course, I never actually argued votes never need to be explained. But sometimes it's more useful to not explain things overmuch.

I wasn't particularly bothered being voted being voted by kyubey, for instance - I felt like his reasoning was understandable but incorrect. I could always plausible understand someone incorrectly scumreading me, if their reasoning made sense.  Your reasoning for that vote, and much of everything you've done, has been tortured to the point of blacking out. It's all based largely on superficial nonsense of \"being useful\" and \"moving things forward\" which is the most superficial of reasoning - you're just looking at how people <span style=\"font-style: italic\">appear</span> in the game rather than the substance/intent of what  they're actually doing, which shows that you're clearly not reading for actual scum motivation behind posts. Everything you've said has been about as far as imaginably possible from genuine scumhunting.<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7182868#p7182868\" class=\"postlink\">post 165</a>, Spiffeh wrote:</cite>@catboi<br><br>Yes it was better than RVS because you actually reacted to it pretty strongly and I doubt an RVS vote would have emitted the same response.

So it goes.<br><br>Read on RC has very little to do with Shinobi, much more to do with playstyle and I wouldn't expect you to understand. At the time of the post I wasn't totally solid on my read of him but still felt he didn't seem like scum, I think <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7179330#p7179330\">70</a>-<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7179344#p7179344\">71</a> were decent in that in that he expressed doubt in my reasoning and my actions - it wouldn't really be to his benefit to suddenly turn on me when I was siding with him initially.

Agree that Jean's recent posting hasn't been great. Would actually disagree in that I think Lex is the most likely of the 3 to be scum though - get zero sense of legitimate scumhunting from him. Hadn't realized vijay only has 5 posts, not really a lot to go by there, I should have picked someone else. I've no idea whether #46 was supposed to be serious or not given how early in the game it was.<br><br>Although looking at vijay does raise a good point: Shinobi town-reading him is <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">abysmal</span>"}

The conversation just turned to be about him and I'm not sure why and don't feel like looking back (because truthfully that detail isn't important). I think you're blowing things out of proportion massively by claiming him not answering one thing is \"promoting apathy\" when it's been basically one day and most of the players have been inactive regardless.<br><br>Actually, further than that, it's pretty silly to suggest that \"promoting apathy\" is a tactic used by scum, especially in this instance. He intends to make people not care...by pissing them off? This reasoning doesn't really jive at all.

I don't think he's scum for not doing so, and if anything it's likely to be the opposite - town's far more likely to be obstinate and difficult in most instances, scum are looking to win people's trust.<br><br>As to what I'm hoping to accomplish, well, I wanted to get a read on you and make conversation, try to establish a baseline of understanding. Haven't succeeded at doing the latter, but I'm not that worried, I have time. If you think I'm actually stifling any pressure to get a response from RC, that's dum. Not like he's going to look at my posts and go \"ah now i no longer have to defend myself thanks catboi\". I'm just trying to hash things out and explain my view (which I'm pretty sure I was asked about, but again it's late)"}

Unlike townies, who are supposed to be motivated to find out who is who, scum's objective in the game is to mislead others into lynching the wrong person. In other words, they're not in it to find out anyone's alignment because they already possess that info. If the majority of posts someone has are at their core just accusations, then it's more likely for that person be scum than not. Of course everyone HAS to accuse at some point, and the frequency of accusations someone does is also very dependent on play style, so this isn't exactly a foolproof method of identifying scum. On average though, I've found it wiser to be more suspicious of those who just accuse and don't make it a priority to explain their reasoning over those who try to understand the other players and explain their thought process to everyone without being forced to. It's not that being investigative proves innocence (since a good scum should already knows this and will therefore try to be as investigative as possible); It's that accusing a lot makes people more suspicious of everyone and therefore makes it harder for the townies to band together, which at the very least is anti-town. This is largely based on my preference in play style and how I think so I'm not really asking people to base their suspicions on what is largely just my gut instinct."}

It's not that being investigative proves innocence (since a good scum should already knows this and will therefore try to be as investigative as possible); It's that accusing a lot makes people more suspicious of everyone and therefore makes it harder for the townies to band together, which at the very least is anti-town.

If they're both innocent, then they both are sure of their innocence. There's also the fact they've both been pretty passionate about their reads of the other, and thats pretty hard to fake without at least one of them actually being innocent. This is good because we can eliminate the option that they're both scum which, while statically speaking is the least likely combination of the two, is something we can't ignore either and is something can help prove both's innocence further down the line. That being said, the 3 remaining combinations (which are Townie/Townie, Scum/Townie, and Townie/Scum) point towards it being more likely for one of them to be scum than for both of them to be innocent, since a probability of 2/3 (both combinations of Townie/Scum) is higher than one of 1/3 (Townie/Townie). <br> <br><span class=\"noboldsig\">The rest of this is pure speculation and assumptions on my part so don't believe anything of it blindly:</span><br><br>Im basing the rest of this on the above paragraph, the fact that the majority of votes is split between RC/Shinobi, and that throughout the whole game Catboi/RC and Spiffeh/Shinobi have had the same votes.  <span class=\"noboldsig\">I strongly believe that  RC is the bad guys here.</span> I can't say the same of Shinobi/Spiffeh, since both of them weren't as quick to NOT be suspicious of one another, unlike Catboi/RC who've been drawing suspicion of one another while sharing the same vote all game. Catboi explained that he wasn't suspicious of him because he thought they shared the same thought process, mostly because at that point RC was the only person who thought Shinobi was scum. Unless Catboi can give a more compelling reason than \"the way he thinks led him to the same conclusion as me\" for his lower level suspicion towards RC than most other people, then it's pretty damn obvious that RC's the scum.  But even if he gave a good explanation for his trusting, that would just mean he trusts RC, i.e. not strong evidence of RC's innocence. <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">New stuff after seeing the news posts:</span><br><br>RC could be doing a very clutch play here by doubling down on the outrage of being accused instead of trying to defend himself with solid reason. While normally innocent people would be just as mad as him, we've known he isn't afraid of looking like a giant douche bag for a while now, which means that 1) he isn't acting on an emotional outburst right now and 2) he's entirely capable of thinking up a plan like this. What I'm trying to say here is that we shouldn't use his outrage as proof of his innocence. If he replaces then I'd be more sure of his guilt, since if he were a townnie who truly doesn't enjoy the game he's playing, he would rather be lynched as a townie to screw over town players over just replacing himself with someone who could potentially aid the town players more than himself (which admittedly wouldnt be that hard if that were the case)."}

While I hope the other townies lynch RC, if he turns out to be innocent then not only would Shinobi need to get immediately lynched, but it would also clear Catboi of any scumminess (at least from my POV). That being said, since Shinobi would be cleared if RC ends up scum, then Catboi has to be the next suspect due to it being more likely for one of Shinobi/Catboi to be scum than both of theming innocent. I wouldn't auto-lynch Catboi though, since he could very well just be affected by the confirmation bias that RC gave him by agreeing with him. Oh and if I die after the first night then you guys need to be completely suspicious of everything Catboi says and lynch him as soon as he can't justify a vote with a solid argument. Something tells me he would just deflect with accusations rather than back his arguments up so that would be a pretty big tell."}

Seriously. If my claims are as idiotic as both you and RC claim, then it really shouldn't be so hard for you two experts to dismantle my arguments. So far all you've done is say I'm wrong 'cause I'm wrong without providing any alternatives to me. The fact that the two people that are accused by me are so unwilling to help me figure things out doesn't help your case."}

I don't have any inside jokes here since I don't know I anyone on this forum. <br><br>In my analysis I said that RC's guilt is strong evidence for Catboi's guilt, but you seem to think otherwise. He's been behaving like RC, except that he actually tries to discuss the game sometimes. He's been defending RC to an extreme that a townie shouldn't be able to do without just being very trusting of him, unlike Spiffeh who pressed RC before deciding he's town. I think it's more likely that Catboi and RC are working together than RC being guilty and Catboi just naively believing in him without question."}

No condescending remark, no unnecessary comments, and you actually explained your reasoning to me. I think we're both disagreeing in some of the facts because we're interpreting one very important thing differently. While you believe that RC had an emotional outburst; I believe that his actions were calculated. Why? Well:<br><br>1) He'd been nothing but unhelpful and rude well before his \"emotional outburst\". Everyone, even you if I remember correctly, agreed that at the very least his actions were anti-town. I know everyone likes to parrot \"anti-town does not = scum\", but actions that are anti-town should be seen as at least a very reasonable cause of suspicion. Your defending of him right after I started suspecting him is what triggered my alarms, but now that I think about, I can see that drawing a connection between you two was probably hasty on my part and I apologize for that.<br><br>2) When he had his \"emotional outburst\" none of his comments or the way he treated us were out of line with what he had said earlier. He was a douchebag all game. So when I saw his meltdown, I didn't think I should take it at face value without some evidence to back it up. Since he kept being unhelpful to me, and you quickly took his actions as proof of innocence, your defending of him was something that I took as proof of guilt.<br><br>I actually think all of this mess can be settled if we discuss and agree on the following:<br><br>Is it not wise to keep in perspective that that RC could be entirely capable of planning his outrage in advance considering the fact that there wasn't any real change in his behavior until it looked like the only way to get some heat off him?

While I hope the other townies lynch RC, if he turns out to be innocent then not only would Shinobi need to get immediately lynched, but it would also clear Catboi of any scumminess (at least from my POV). That being said, since Shinobi would be cleared if RC ends up scum, then Catboi has to be the next suspect due to it being more likely for one of Shinobi/Catboi to be scum than both of theming innocent. I wouldn't auto-lynch Catboi though, since he could very well just be affected by the confirmation bias that RC gave him by agreeing with him. Oh and if I die after the first night then you guys need to be completely suspicious of everything Catboi says and lynch him as soon as he can't justify a vote with a solid argument.

I get the sense that RC is an abrasive, emotional player which makes the whole outburst seem genuine. The idea that he was trying to be \"helpful\" willfully glosses over the fact that he put himself at L-1. Very few players are brave enough to pull off that sort of gambit as scum and the fact is it was unlikely to work here. You have to absolutely be reaching in order to see his play as some sort of scum plan<br><br>A quick glimpse of RC's meta shows he's prone to making short posts with very little explanation as town while being abrasive when pushed on as can be seen <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?t=62114&amp;f=2&amp;st=0&amp;sk=t&amp;sd=a&amp;user_select%5B%5D=20971&amp;user_select%5B%5D=0&amp;user_select%5B%5D=0&amp;user_sort=Go\" class=\"postlink\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?t=62176&amp;f=50&amp;st=0&amp;sk=t&amp;sd=a&amp;user_select%5B%5D=20971&amp;user_select%5B%5D=0&amp;user_select%5B%5D=0&amp;user_sort=Go\" class=\"postlink\">here</a> he even references selfvoting in the latter game though he doesn't actually do so) so the stuff you're attacking him on is alignment neutral at best and really picking a fight with half the players in the game on day 1 makes no sense whatsoever as scum play.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">@vijay</span> - I don't even know how to begin to address your post but what Scorpious is referencing is an ongoing game we're both in (he's dead, I'm not) and that's primarily the source of his awkwardness in commenting on me.

I don't think he's done anything so out of the ordinary for you to be this adamant about it.</div></blockquote>well he's done plenty to deserve it, but you and most of the game seem to have tuned things out, possibly because you're only looking at a very surface level.<br><br>(went to reread and now I <span style=\"font-style: italic\">know</span> I'm getting ignored because I left a sentence unfinished in 347 and no one called me on it)<br><br>Read <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7185623#p7185623\">232</a>. Shinobi's basis for his reads have been based on extremely shallow premises, and he's been trying to lynch people for not explaining their reads, but is unwilling to explain his own reads when pressed to do so. It's a contradictory stance, and his sarcasm/dismissiveness in response from him doesn't make sense coming from town - at this point he should either be trying to reason with me, or he thinks i'm scum and trying to get him lynched (and that's clearly not the case). But snarky responses like <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7185635#p7185635\">234</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7185683#p7185683\">238</a> effectively just shut down communication and serve to dismiss my arguments in people's minds. If \"unexplained reads\" were legitimately a scumtell for him he'd do the best he could to explain his, but he's adamantly against this whenever I try to press him for reasoning. (i also get a sense he doesn't really believe this is a tell).<br><br>Regardless he's held largely static reads throughout the game, only essentially backing off on me because I proved to be too much to handle. I don't think a read of who is \"useful\" or not is a.) a good basis for a scumread or b.) something you can plausibly decide within 3 pages of a game. It seems contrived, like he's just looking for people to fit in a particular box that has very little to do with whether or not they're town or scum. And that's all he's really said about it, if you read him.<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7185824#p7185824\">241</a> is a bland suck-up response, actually. It's the post scum make when they see town applying effort it - give a vague compliment and move on. He doesn't really say <span style=\"font-style: italic\">why</span> he likes kyubey's post, he just says he does and then never re-visits anything about it. It's similar to his pronounced townreads spifeeh and vijay in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7181705#p7181705\">104</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7181810#p7181810\">108</a> for, essentially, activity (which is not a tell by any stretch of the imagination) when vijay's lone meaningful game content to that point was post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7181526#p7181526\">100</a> - I find it incredibly hard to believe someone could get a town read off that post and \"like the way [he's] are thinking about this game\", because to that point, you really can't get any sense of the way vijay's reading the game. Even though I reasonably read him as town I feel like the spiffeh read bugged me too though I can't remember why. (Also criticized this in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7182453#p7182453\">142</a>, btw). It reads a lot more like scum picking out players to call town that it does town looking at genuine town-tells.<br><br>Put simply I just don't buy his reads as coming from a legitimate scumhunting process.  (I thought I had some better way of putting things but I lost the thought.) The most he ever gives for voting Jean is in post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7182813#p7182813\">157</a>, which is incredibly weak reasoning, and he's offered essentially no analysis since then.<br><br>p-edit: psyche, I want to kiss you"}

Cause all I see are justifications that only indicate we can't be sure of Shonobi's alignment (which I agree with). If Catboi's true motive were to find the truth, then you'd think he would be at least willing to give himself some room for error. At the very least I see this as anti-town behavior, since if he keeps tunneling in on whoever he thinks is scum with only circumstantial evidence, we run the very real risk of him leading everyone to make a wrong choice,  even if he didn't actually intend for it to happen.</div></blockquote><br>Everyone's wrong sometimes. I'm not sure what the hell you mean by \"give himself some room for error\". Are you saying I should have admitted it was possible shinobi was town when I was tunneling him? I'd only do that as scum to leave myself a way out after a mislynch. I stand by a lot of what I said. I think his responses have been hypocritical in a lot of ways, and his reasoning shallow.<br><br>If Shinobi wants to take being pushed on personally and act like a jerk about it, that's his problem.<br><br>You're like one of 3 people I still have under consideration as scum, so, meh."}

Granted, this obviously doesn't guarantee you're a townie, but even then, it's more town than what most other players have done and is enough to satisfy my curiosity on you.

I'm very confident he's town for reasons I've explained that you're too lazy/selfish to care about. RC and psyche are also very likely town in my estimation, as I've said. At that point process of elimination leaves me to go after low content posters, Jean and Lex both fit that bill.
