Once that amount has been reached, they're dead. No unvotes will save them. Players can post in the thread up until I post the lynch scene and the thread is locked.<br>\n6.

If you're going to be gone for longer than a 72-hour period, post in-thread letting everyone know for how long.<br>\n10. If 72 hours pass without a player posting or saying they will be absent, I will prod them if requested to do so by any other player.<br>\n11.

I have explained why I voted for whoever I did over and over, which really no one else has had to do to such an extent.

Two weeks is an unimaginably long timeframe. There's absolutely no reason to start a wagon on Scumhunter right now, and definitely not to simply to \"save the host the trouble\" (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4116052#p4116052\">#242</a>). That is the stupidest reason to lynch someone I've ever heard.<br>\n<br>\nSeriously, enough with this Baby fiasco. She's made double the number of posts of the second most active poster, and there's plenty of material to draw conclusions from. 80% of the posts in this topic are about whether Baby is obvious scum or village idiot. We're one and a half days into a 2-week day and we're already considering an early lynch (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4115576#p4115576\">#199</a>)? How does that help in finding other scum? What if Baby flips town (although, I do find that next to impossible)? All this concentrated fire on Baby is making looking for other scum almost impossible. They need to implement some kind of anti-ISO feature &gt;.&gt;<br>\n<br>\nI say everyone drops this arguing right now. It's a mess that will never get resolved until someone gets lynched, and I don't want an early lynch. Let's make full use of the two weeks. We can go back to discussing who to lynch 3-5 days before the deadline, that's plenty of time.<br>\n<br>\nWith that said, I caught this while going through ISOs individually.

For whatever reason, you are choosing to play this game faking being a newb.  You have managed to make almost every single newb mistake possible, a feat that very very few actual newbs manage to do, while avoiding making the mistakes that would directly get you removed from the game (trying to prove yourself via language in your role PM comes to mind).  <br>\n<br>\nI've played Mafia games before that require creating a character to play as, and then role playing as that character throughout the game.  Some of the tricks that were used to create a character were giving yourself these weird little quirks to set you apart from everyone . . . like always capitalizing every game-related word . . . or insisting on calling players by the incorrect gender, even after they've repeatedly corrected you.  The fact that you've gone to great lengths to continue these things are huge red flags that this is an act, as are your vague answers to getting questioned on your background.  <br>\n<br>\nI encourage everyone to read through all of BabyBlue's posts, not just in this thread, but across the entire site.

But if you've got the brains to pull off a scheme like this (and I've got a few guesses as to why you are doing it), you already know that.  By bringing this shtick into the game, you are degrading the experience for everyone, and intentionally dumbing down your play is not playing to your win condition.
