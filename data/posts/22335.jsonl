No outside communication about this game unless your role permits it.<br>2. Don't quote your Role PM. Don't fake-quote it, either. Paraphrasing is fine.<br>3. Do not edit your posts.<br>4. To vote somebody, bold your vote, such as <span class=\"noboldsig\">vote: ChaosOmega</span>. If your vote isn't bolded, it will not count. Unvotes are not necessary to change your vote.<br>5. During the day, a player will be lynched when they have more than 50% of the players currently alive voting for them. Once that amount has been reached, they're dead. No unvotes will save them. Players can post in the thread up until I post the lynch scene and the thread is locked.<br>6. Once it has been posted by me that you are dead, you're dead. Do not post any more, <span class=\"noboldsig\">not even a bah post</span>.<br>7. <span class=\"noboldsig\">Every day will have a rigid deadline of 2 weeks.</span> The only way an extension will be granted is if I deem it necessary due to extenuating circumstances.<br>8. Nights will have a deadline of 3 days. If you have a night action and do not send one, you will do nothing. If that is what you want to do, you should tell me that so that night can be wrapped up more quickly.<br>9. If you're going to be gone for longer than a 72-hour period, post in-thread letting everyone know for how long.<br>10. If 72 hours pass without a player posting or saying they will be absent, I will prod them if requested to do so by any other player.<br>11. If a player would receive a fourth prod (unless it is their first prod of the day) or they have not responded to a prod within 24 hours, I will search for a replacement for them.<br>12. <span style=\"color: #0000BF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Blue is my color. Don't use it.</span></span> Also, no small or invisible text.<br>13. Please PM me if you have any questions about the game.<br>14. Have fun.<br>15. If anyone breaks any of the aforementioned rules, I have complete control over the actions that will be taken.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><span style=\"color: #0000BF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Sample Townie Role PM</span></span></span></span><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>You are a <span class=\"noboldsig\">Townie</span>.

Some of the tricks that were used to create a character were giving yourself these weird little quirks to set you apart from everyone . . . like always capitalizing every game-related word . . . or insisting on calling players by the incorrect gender, even after they've repeatedly corrected you.

He'd be the logical kill, the aggressive town (?) player, getting BabyBlue, bossing town around, full of opinion, etc. I know, NK speculation, don't do it, bla bla bla, but, for me at least, killing Parama N1 would be a good choice for either Scum or a SK. However, he is still alive D3. How is that? My theory is that he either bussed BabyBlue and Echo, or is our SK (and, if he is a BP SK, he'd be immune to the NK N2, and that would account for the lack of NK that night. Of course, that would mean he killed SV, but, as has been commented, a SK wouldn't kill him. meh)"}

The way your are pushing for his lynch today feels like scum trying to ride a string of lynches to the end.  Your bus on BabyBlue, if I'm right, was well played.  You recognized early on how much of a liability she was, so just went for the powerbus to reap towncred.  A scum player in that situation would try to speed up the game from that point on, so that no one would notice that they are still alive when they should have been dead a long time ago, or that they aren't providing the content to back up their suspects (who, in turn, would become mislynches).  That's exactly how you seem to be playing Day 3, which makes me suspect that that is your plan."}
