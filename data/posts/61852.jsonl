This is my third game on the site, I have no right to call anyone a weak player. I didn't even have a read on you until you overreacted. And you weren't even on the wagon when I pointed that out or when I voted you? So how exactly am I looking for a weak link when you backed off of it? Also; if you can reliably read BBT and you thought he was scummy enough to vote, why did you back off? And why are you still ignoring my questions to you? Please try harder to find crap reasons to discredit me. Your hesitance was non-committal, you commented on the largest wagon in the game when you came in and agreed with it but added nothing to it. When you did finally vote you almost immediately backed off. Literally 4 minutes passed before you unvoted. If you are confident in your ability to read BBT and read him as scum, what happened in that four minutes that changed your mind?"}

Her most recent posting, put simply, just does not come from scum her.<br><br>It all comes down to one principle: <span class=\"noboldsig\">Sakura is not emotionally manipulative as scum.</span>  The extent of direct manipulation in her scum game does not come anywhere close to what it would have been if she is scum here - when scum, she usually relies on looking town via other means, such as feigning scum hunting well or playing to her town meta.  The only real manipulation in her scum game is based on weak ATE (in the last scum game, she spent a lot of time upplaying the idea that she hadn't played town in a while and was lost as a result of that) and positionality (simple buddying).<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Ergo, Sakura would not attempt to use \"I'll never talk to you again if you're town here\" as a reaction test as scum.</span>  She just fucking wouldn't.  She wouldn't so much as pretend to bring that much of an outside influence - her friendship with notsci - into the game.  And yes, you can say \"lol reaction test\", but that doesn't change shit.  She would not so much as pretend to hurt notsci in the way she did here as scum.<br><br>And yes, you can tell I'm serious about this when I'm using capital letters.  We all know that's the best way to tell when I'm serious about a post.  But anyway:<br><br>I probably know Sakura better than anyone else on this site - and I am fully expecting  a certain person to walk in here and reference a certain Touhou game where I horribly misread scum-her and defended her all game, but the thing with that game is, I was not actually as confident with my read on her as I usually am when town reading her.  Sakura is a player who is similar to fferyllt, as in, from time to time, she will make a post that can only possibly come from town-her and that scum-her would never be able to make.  This allows people to be able to say, with &gt;99% certainty, that she is town whenever this happens.  In the large theme game, my read on her was not quite at that level - only about 90% or so, and she sure as hell did not make any strong \"conf-town\" posts over the course of that game.  (And, quite honestly, you can see me calling her-scum in the mason QT in that game right before I died, so attempting to discredit me based on that game would be a load of shit.)<br><br>This game isn't that.  She is, absolutely, town here.  I would probably quite literally quit this game entirely if she wound up being scum* here.  (*And just for posterity's sake, since we all know how dishonorable it is to make bets and not hold yourself to them, this only really applies towards her being group-scum in a single-scum setting, because fuck SKs/multiball.)<br><br>I have not yet determined if this means anything in terms of notsci's alignment - I just got back home - but regardless, I agree this situation needs a fucking emergency brake, and immediately."}

I don't think comparing a newbie game to a normal game is valid. I believe Soren thought he could quite easily get away with those kinds of questions as scum because 'Hey, I'm a newbie!'. There is no chance in hell he would get away with those questions now. Additionally, if those questions got Soren scum read in that game I wouldn't be surprised if he employed different questions this time around anyway.<br><br>Also, I flat out disagree that Soren is committing to stances. Yeah, some questions like her questioning Bulge for reads are valid questions, but again, no follow up. Also, when there are lots of these questions put together it just comes across as making noise/trying to look like scum hunting when in actuality they are very easy questions for scum to ask.<br><br>I don't see Soren trying to work out people's alignments.

(and to be honest, you calling me scum while simultaneously asking for my vote is  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_igmeou.gif\" alt=\":igmeou:\" title=\"IGMEOU\"> and, while I suppose there's no logical reason for it, really does not do a good job of convincing me you're willing to work with me here.)<br><br>we still have what, 9 days left?  you can't just assume people are ignoring you because they all haven't dropped what they're doing and voted whoever you're voting.  there is still plenty of time for people to make up their minds and consolidate.  and I think it's pretty obvious that Mala is a viable lynch right now: you have 2 votes - plus mine if BBT doesn't pan out - and no one else has more than 3 votes.  and most of the people in the game are pretty obviously considering Mala-scum.  and I'm sorry but blaming *me* for this is out of line.<br><br>I know it can be ridiculously frustrating to try and get someone lynched and not get anywhere with it.  but all things considered, you're doing fine.  the only thing to really do in situations like this is step back and analyze the situation objectively - calm down, and continue moving forward."}

The 923 reference is to Buldge's iso read of Mala, which I agreed largely with in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6882195#p6882195\">819</a>.

Don't disagree with the reasoning all that much.

That's going to take more than surface reading her ISO.<br><br>If scum is on the wagon, I'd say it's between RC/AK/BBT. Need to look into AK more. Bulge's <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6895892#p6895892\">976</a> is kind of weird too, considering he said he wanted to see the wagon happen but I can understand that he didn't expect a wagon that fast or a hammer that quickly. <br><br>Looking into AK in a bit."}

I just dgaf about the BBT wagon. I'd need to go through BBT's iso to have a solid opinion on it. From what I remember, his hammer yesterday was really bad but that's the only thing he's done that sticks out to me.  Besides his  early PL push, he's done nothing in this game that is especially memorable besides the fact that  he pretty much said he wasn't going to finish reading the last few pages he had left, saw the wagon and hammered. Which is something I've seen scum do before. I have no problem with the wagon at this point. But Day 2 just started, I have no intent to hammer anyone right now. I'm still going through the game again."}

BBT gets shot, scum knows he is at the very least BP. You are working under the assumption that scum knew 100% BBT was the SK, which is faulty. At worst, scum gets a BP lynched and doesn't have to worry about wasting another night on him. At best, they get the SK and remove an uncontrolled factor in the night. That is win-win. Getting BBT lynched only benefits scum, for the same exact reason you put out there. Letting your team fall into 7-1-1 is suicide, for scum. Leaving the SK alive keeps the risk of being hit again, even if you think he is actively trying to hit town players. And second of all, <span class=\"noboldsig\">Cho was not that town</span>. If SK is trying to kill town players, why not go for someone who was more transparent? Cho was doing her damnedest to not be transparent. She dodged your questions, she dodged mine. So this 'SK wouldn't try to hit scum' is bullshit. If he was going for town players, there were much better options.<br><br>So you are telling me that I'm scum, when both Bulge and Huntress did the exact same thing you find scummy in me? Only difference is that Bulge hammered BBT . Why am I more likely to be scum over Huntress in your scenario?<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6909830#p6909830\" class=\"postlink\">post 1153</a>, pieguyn wrote:</cite>nothing's going on to make me change my reads<br><br>I *think* NM might be town for tonal reasons.  my impression of him from pokemon upick is that his posts generally just feel flat when he's scum, and I don't really get that here.

This is Pie defending Soren, who is conftown. I'll stick with what I said the last time that I posted about Pie's interactions with the then living players; she was buddying up to him hardcore. Pie isn't aggressive here, Pie doesn't suggest Huntress is scum, just that her read is wrong. Could be Pie trying to protect Soren from the scum mislynch, trying to keep someone she thought she could control around?<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6872120#p6872120\" class=\"postlink\">post 542</a>, pieguyn wrote:</cite><span class=\"noboldsig\">@Mala:</span> walk me through why Huntress is town?</div></blockquote><br><br>See my first post, could be trying to cement that town read.

Why would I try to change Huntress's mind when she said that she wasn't ruling NS out? 0 fucking sense as scum.
