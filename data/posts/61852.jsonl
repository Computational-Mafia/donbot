This is my third game on the site, I have no right to call anyone a weak player. I didn't even have a read on you until you overreacted. And you weren't even on the wagon when I pointed that out or when I voted you? So how exactly am I looking for a weak link when you backed off of it? Also; if you can reliably read BBT and you thought he was scummy enough to vote, why did you back off? And why are you still ignoring my questions to you? Please try harder to find crap reasons to discredit me. Your hesitance was non-committal, you commented on the largest wagon in the game when you came in and agreed with it but added nothing to it. When you did finally vote you almost immediately backed off. Literally 4 minutes passed before you unvoted. If you are confident in your ability to read BBT and read him as scum, what happened in that four minutes that changed your mind?", "time": "Sat May 16, 2015 1:55 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=61852&start=325", "forum": "53", "thread": "61852"}

Her most recent posting, put simply, just does not come from scum her.<br>\n<br>\nIt all comes down to one principle: <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Sakura is not emotionally manipulative as scum.</div>  The extent of direct manipulation in her scum game does not come anywhere close to what it would have been if she is scum here - when scum, she usually relies on looking town via other means, such as feigning scum hunting well or playing to her town meta.  The only real manipulation in her scum game is based on weak ATE (in the last scum game, she spent a lot of time upplaying the idea that she hadn't played town in a while and was lost as a result of that) and positionality (simple buddying).<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Ergo, Sakura would not attempt to use \"I'll never talk to you again if you're town here\" as a reaction test as scum.</div>  She just fucking wouldn't.  She wouldn't so much as pretend to bring that much of an outside influence - her friendship with notsci - into the game.  And yes, you can say \"lol reaction test\", but that doesn't change shit.  She would not so much as pretend to hurt notsci in the way she did here as scum.<br>\n<br>\nAnd yes, you can tell I'm serious about this when I'm using capital letters.  We all know that's the best way to tell when I'm serious about a post.  But anyway:<br>\n<br>\nI probably know Sakura better than anyone else on this site - and I am fully expecting  a certain person to walk in here and reference a certain Touhou game where I horribly misread scum-her and defended her all game, but the thing with that game is, I was not actually as confident with my read on her as I usually am when town reading her.  Sakura is a player who is similar to fferyllt, as in, from time to time, she will make a post that can only possibly come from town-her and that scum-her would never be able to make.  This allows people to be able to say, with &gt;99% certainty, that she is town whenever this happens.  In the large theme game, my read on her was not quite at that level - only about 90% or so, and she sure as hell did not make any strong \"conf-town\" posts over the course of that game.  (And, quite honestly, you can see me calling her-scum in the mason QT in that game right before I died, so attempting to discredit me based on that game would be a load of shit.)<br>\n<br>\nThis game isn't that.  She is, absolutely, town here.  I would probably quite literally quit this game entirely if she wound up being scum* here.  (*And just for posterity's sake, since we all know how dishonorable it is to make bets and not hold yourself to them, this only really applies towards her being group-scum in a single-scum setting, because fuck SKs/multiball.)<br>\n<br>\nI have not yet determined if this means anything in terms of notsci's alignment - I just got back home - but regardless, I agree this situation needs a fucking emergency brake, and immediately.", "time": "Mon May 18, 2015 6:03 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=61852&start=650", "forum": "53", "thread": "61852"}

BBT gets shot, scum knows he is at the very least BP. You are working under the assumption that scum knew 100% BBT was the SK, which is faulty. At worst, scum gets a BP lynched and doesn't have to worry about wasting another night on him. At best, they get the SK and remove an uncontrolled factor in the night. That is win-win. Getting BBT lynched only benefits scum, for the same exact reason you put out there. Letting your team fall into 7-1-1 is suicide, for scum. Leaving the SK alive keeps the risk of being hit again, even if you think he is actively trying to hit town players. And second of all, <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Cho was not that town</div>. If SK is trying to kill town players, why not go for someone who was more transparent? Cho was doing her damnedest to not be transparent. She dodged your questions, she dodged mine. So this 'SK wouldn't try to hit scum' is bullshit. If he was going for town players, there were much better options.<br>\n<br>\nSo you are telling me that I'm scum, when both Bulge and Huntress did the exact same thing you find scummy in me?

I don't particularly think it's correct to call something \"posturing\" unless there's a strategic advantage to be gained from it - aka scum attempting to lock people out of doing certain actions.  writing it off as posturing feels more like an easy way to discredit his scum read on you.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6867966#p6867966\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6867966#p6867966\" data-post-id=\"6867966\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 299</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=23899\">BlueBloodedToffee</a> wrote:</cite>168 - Noted that Bulge tried to continue RVS despite there being plenty of information/content to work with.</div></blockquote><br>\ndon't like this, either.  calling people out for RVS voting after RVS is an easy excuse for scum to pull up in order to look like they're scum hunting.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6868315#p6868315\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6868315#p6868315\" data-post-id=\"6868315\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 319</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=23899\">BlueBloodedToffee</a> wrote:</cite>Spoiler: Soren's pointless questions<br>\n<br>\nThat isn't even all of them.
