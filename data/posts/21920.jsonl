All <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=6470\" class=\"postlink\">sitewide rules</a> apply.<br>\n2. Play to win. It's more fun to win fairly than if your opponents throw the game.<br>\n3. Don't quote things that aren't public knowledge, or make use of the exact wording or metadata like timestamps of private communication. (It's OK to paraphrase the meaning. Just not to use things like wording as evidence that you're not faking the communication.)<br>\n4. Don't use hidden or small text, cryptography, or provable randomness. (Breadcrumbs are OK.)<br>\n5. Until this game is over, don't discuss it anywhere but this thread, or other locations I specifically allow you to discuss it in. If I send you a link to a place where you can discuss the game privately, keep that link secret until the game is over. (And if someone tries to contact you about this game and they shouldn't be doing so, let me or a list mod know immediately.)<br>\n6. Dead players (i.e. players who have been lynched or killed) shouldn't post (not here, nor in places their role PM allows them to, nor in unrelated areas). I will create a QuickTopic that dead players can use to discuss the game if they wish, and give the link to players when they die.<br>\n7. Don't pretend to break a rule, even if you aren't actually breaking another rule. (For instance, you can't post your role PM publicly; so don't post a fake role PM publicly either.)<br>\n8. Please try to stay civil. It's not fun having a game thread full of insults and personal attacks.<br>\n9. Don't try to gain an advantage from rulebreaking, either yours or another player's. (This doesn't mean you shouldn't report it if you see it happens; just don't try to use it as a weapon.) If players break rules, I will try to resolve the situation in a way that preserves the balance of the game. (This means that if you're trying to use a breaking strategy that depends on deliberately getting modkilled, don't expect it to work.)<br>\n10. Don't pretend to take day actions you can't actually take. That is, don't vote unless you can vote, don't attempt to daykill someone unless your role actually allows you to daykill someone, etc.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Administrative</div></div><br>\n11. Day deadlines will be two weeks long. Night deadlines will be 72 hours long. I will let you know the deadlines in each vote count.<br>\n12. If players need to be replaced, deadlines will be extended accordingly; days will not end due to deadlines within 72 hours of a player replacing in, nor nights within 24 hours of a player replacing in.<br>\n13. If you find you don't have enough time to play the game, let me know and I'll try to find a replacement. (But that makes the game worse for everyone, so try to avoid doing that.)<br>\n14. If you want to replace into this game, let me know by PM. In an ideal world, nobody would ever replace out and your request would be pointless, but in practice it's pretty rare for that to actually happen. I'll let you know when a slot becomes free.<br>\n15. If you don't post for 72 hours, you will be prodded; if you don't respond to a prod by posting in the thread within 48 hours, are prodded twice in a game day, or are prodded three times overall, I will begin looking for a replacement, and you will be replaced out when I find one, unless you post in the thread before I find one.<br>\n16. If the number of players voting for a player doesn't match the number of votes on that player, I will make that clear in the vote count. If you see a discrepancy without an obvious sign that it's deliberate, it's an accident; please let me know so that I can fix the vote count.<br>\n17. Your role PM requires you to confirm that you're willing to play when the game starts. The game will start when 80% or more of the player list (for a 13 player game, that's 11 players) have confirmed.<br>\n18. If you are required to take an action, but don't submit one, the moderator will choose your targets for you randomly.<br>\n19. Should something go wrong, please contact me or a list mod. If I should need to be replaced for any reason, Papa Zito knows where to find details of the setup, and can appoint a backup mod.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Setup</div></div><br>\n20. This game will start with a day phase, then alternate between night and day phases until the game ends.<br>\n21. During day phases, each player can vote to lynch themself or another player, or to no-lynch. You can change or retract your vote as often as you like, but can only have one vote out at a time. Votes will be reset at the start of each day.<br>\n22. I don't require players to unvote; voting will implicitly remove any previous vote you might have. However, consider explicitly unvoting anyway as a courtesy to the other players.<br>\n23. To vote, I recommend using the [vo&#8203;te][/vote] tags, which look like this:<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: callforjudgement</span>. (There is a similar tag for unvoting.) I will accept anything that I notice that looks like a vote, though. (If you're going to boldvote, make life easier for people by putting it on a line of its own.)<br>\n24. Day will end when a majority of players (that is, more than half) are voting for the same person. That player will be lynched and removed from the game, no longer counting as alive. Then a night phase will start.<br>\n25. Day will also end at deadline, or if half or more of the players are voting for No Lynch. In these circumstances, nobody will be lynched, but a night phase will start anyway.<br>\n26. During a night phase, this thread will be locked, and players who can take actions overnight can take them by PMing me with the action they want to take. (Anti-town players who have a QuickTopic to communicate in can alternatively take night actions by posting them in bold in their QuickTopic.) All night actions will be resolved simultaneously at the end of the night, using <a href=\"https://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Natural_Action_Resolution\" class=\"postlink\">Natural Action Resolution</a> (in the usual case where there are no conflicts between actions, this means resolving each action after actions that affect it). Note that killing a player does not prevent them taking actions that night. Night phases end at deadline.<br>\n27. As a Mini Normal game, the exact details of this game's setup are not public. However, you do know the following facts about the setup:<br>\n<ul><li>At least 12 of the 13 players have an explicitly normal role, from the following list: Vanilla Townie, Sane Cop, Doctor, Vigilante, Roleblocker, Mason, Innocent Child, Jailkeeper, Tracker, Watcher, Gunsmith, Miller, Bodyguard, Role Cop, Doublevoter, Hider, Neighbor, Neighborizer, Jack of All Trades, Serial Killer, Mafia Goon, Mafia Traitor, Mafia Godfather, Mafia Framer, Mafia-aligned versions of above roles, possibly with an explicitly normal modifier: Even/Odd Night, Non-Consecutive Night, X-Shot, Bulletproof, Neighbor, Compulsive, Macho, Weak, Backup (with or without primary role present). It is possible that all 13 players have a role on this list; it is also possible that the 13th player has some other role.<br>\n</li><li>There are either 1 or 2 anti-town factions consisting of 2 or more players; and either 0 or 1 anti-town factions consisting of a single player.<br>\n</li><li>The only possible win conditions are the Town, Mafia/Werewolf, Traitor, and Serial Killer win conditions. (So no jesters, lynchers, survivors, or cults.)<br>\n</li><li>At least 1 player will get the Vanilla Townie role PM, which looks like this (with the name changed):<br>\n<fieldset style=\"border:3px outset grey;padding:5px 10px\">Welcome, <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">callforjudgement</div>.

I honestly felt like he was trying to suck up to people by calling them friends, and I hate sucks up.  And you say I was trying to blend in by voting you?

Gorckat's reason for voting Oso seems pretty weak to me, and not completely coherent to the game state at the time. Really seems like he's voting just to vote to me.</div></blockquote><br>\nLet's analyze it a bit.<br>\n<br>\nSentence one. First off, he doesn't really explain why aggressiveness = scum (although that isn't a huge issue) - the bigger issue is that, in a way, it reads to me as either \"going with the flow\" or as trying to preemptively pacify robbnva. I also feel like it could be a bit more concise, but that's very minor. <br>\n<br>\nNext, he says that Oso and I are generating information. Well whoop-de-do - why is this important? How is generating information a towntell (if that's what you're implying it is)? More than that, his townreads at this point are the three people who, presumably, he sees as being the most active. Now, this in and of itself isn't a problem. However, it feels like he's calling multiple people town <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">because they're active.</div> And it doesn't read as genuine - it reads as if his reads are on the people that they're on for the sake of convenience.<br>\n<br>\nNext... he's withholding a vote on nikanor, although he wouldn't be his last choice. So uh, this tells us a lot of information about your read on nikanor. What choice would he be? second? Why do you feel the need to state that you're withholding a vote on him when you're voting someone else, who you said you found scummier? Essentially, this line just feels overjustified. It's overjustified and very indirect - the same thing could have been accomplished (at least i think this is what he's saying) with a simple \"nikanor is scummy,\" or something to that extent. Because of that, it feels really contrived, like he's trying to make it look like he put effort into the read.<br>\n<br>\nAnd finally, his Gorkcat fos. \"Voting just to vote\" isn't really the best justification for a vote, imo. I think gork's vote was, in a way, voting just to vote - it reads like he was just trying to put some pressure there. The vote isn't terrible, but i'm making a \"case\" so i may as well comment.<br>\n<br>\nThe post as a whole just gives me a really strong gut feeling, as well. Particularly the nikanor line.

{"number": 125, "id": "4027709", "user": "vijay2vasandani", "user_id": "16810", "content": "Nope. One thing though, you should listen to Above and Beyond. Totally calms you down. My go to music while playing mafia.<br>\n<br>\nFirst thing: you obviously don't. Trust me.<br>\n<br>\nSecond thing: oh yeah? Then why is my reasoning against splitfarvle exactly the same as the point I agreed with?<br>\n<br>\nThird thing: what is the point of this? Buzzwording refers to the act of appealing to authority by using terms that are specific to the mafia player's jargon in an attempt to gain support due to familiarity with the term used, instead of it actually being scummy. How did I do that? The fact that you did it and I called you out on it means that I wasn't buzzwording. If you didn't do it then I would have been. Also, it just seems like an attempt to ridicule me rather than saying how it is scummy.<br>\n<br>\nFourth thing (Q1) : I voted WMPE because Oso did. I assume it's because he piled onto the Nik wagon after me. Either way, I voted to add weight to the bandwagon on him.<br>\n<br>\nFifth thing (Q2) : okay, splitfarvle's reason for the vote (the \"so you don't feel left out\" bit) was random. Ergo, the reason for his vote was that it was a random vote. But since we were out of RVS, placing a random vote is wishy washy reasoning for a vote. It gives you room to move it around because \"you were just messing\".<br>\n<br>\nRegarding the buddying, you don't understand. Read below to understand my play more. But the reason I complained about splitfarvle's buddying is because of two reasons. He hadn't posted a lot, which means he hasn't been able to get a personal grip on the game, cement early reads etc etc. Also, I haven't seen ConfidAnon post that much content, so splitfarvle shouldn't have been able to ascertain a town read on him. You can buddy people you think are town as town because you form a pseudo-voting bloc. That's pressure at it's finest. But since he did neither of these things, and personally I don't think this is his playstyle, his buddying raised alarm bells for me.<br>\n<br>\n3rd point: naive. The voting bit is by definition distancing. But look at the reasoning (despite being random) behind it. It's obviously an attempt to elicit positive jokey feelings towards, albeit subconsciously from Confid towards splitfarvle. This is why you don't get my game. It's mafia, you can't take everything at face value. Read between the lines.<br>\n<br>\nExtra point on sheeping and buddying, especially early game: I don't know if there is an MD thread on this but I think there should. I would put it up but I'm not that experienced yet. But from personal experience, we know pressure catches scum. Yet there is a limit to how much pressure one person can put early game. Hence, people who I have town reads on for whatever reason, I have no issue with sheeping or buddying. That way we can vote together (voting bloc mentioned above), or at least attack together. Two people definitely put more pressure than one and thus scum (ie you) can be caught earlier. But I'm not extending this.

Not absolutely, but I sure don't want to lynch him D1.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nI wasn't really seeing much of a scum read in Shotty but now I'm starting to. His original post that Implosion took fault with still does seem to be the victim of overanalysis to me, but this comment is fencesitting to the extreme. Originally I had interpreted his statement that \"Well, I find Robbnva's style very aggressive, which I like.\" to mean that he thinks Robbnva is town (since some people use the idea of liking something as synonymous with the idea that something is town-ish). But here, all he's saying is that Robbnva is aggressive and makes many posts, and that he's \"not absolutely\" town but also not someone he wants to lynch D1, which says almost nothing about his thoughts on Robbnva's alignment. <br>\n<br>\nShotty, apart from gorc, who do you think is scummy right now and why? <br>\n<br>\nNikanor continues to appear to be scummy to me. <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Nikanor wrote:</cite>I'm generating content by asking questions.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nYes, and asking questions is fine, but it becomes scummy when someone asks questions and then never or practically never follows up on them. A town player often asks questions to clarify something or find information in order to help draw conclusions about another player; hence, there is an element of follow-up. But what I find scummy about Nikanor is that he asks questions but then does not follow up. It looks like he's asking questions for the sake of appearing to participate in the game when in actuality he is not contributing much content.<br>\n<br>\nHis posted list of reads don't make him seem any town-er right now, either. They look on the weak side to me. For instance, he says Oso is scum but doesn't provide anything to back up that read, and his scum read of ConfidAnon is even weaker. ConfidAnon attacked Robbnva for going after an easy target, and then Nikanor is calling ConfidAnon scum for going after Robbnva as an easy target. His posts provide little substance and he doesn't comment much on other events going on in the game, and his reads reflect that.<br>\n<br>\nAs for Vijay vs. Robbnva, I feel pretty strongly that the former is scum and the latter is town. Vijay's reaction seems way over the top, especially with his more recent posts about essentially \"sacrificing\" himself for the good of the town, which is ironic considering his weird accusations throughout this day that Robbnva is cracking under pressure. Even beyond his odd reaction, he still continues to push what feels like a contrived case on Split.<br>\n<br>\nAs for Gorc, I get some scum vibes from this post:<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>gorckat wrote:</cite><br>\nRobb is a touch grating with his aggressiveness, but I appreciate the style. On Robb v vijay, vijay seems to focus solely on their tit-for-tat while Robb continues looking at and responding to other players.<br>\n<br>\nWMPE's explanations of who he will vote are terribly vague.<br>\n<br>\nShotty didn't answer what I thought was a valid question- at the time he thinks my vote is out of line with the game state, who should have been voted?</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nHe's making a lot of observations but not drawing any actual conclusions. For instance, he mentions that Vijay focuses only on the argument whereas Robbnva is commenting on the game as a whole, but then doesn't say his opinions on that. He's just lurking beneath the surface of the game.<br>\n<br>\nMy updated scum reads are most strongly Nikanor and Vijay, followed less strongly by Gorc and Shotty.", "time": "Tue May 08, 2012 2:42 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=21920&start=125", "forum": "53", "thread": "21920"}

What bothered me was that you were quick to assume Oso was rolefishing, something that's not, in my opinion, particularly clear or \"screaming\" evidence, especially in light of your remarkably strong scum read on Robbnva. If you had had a \"normal\" scum read on Robbnva, for lack of a better word, your sudden switch might not have stuck out so much to me, but you were literally certain he was scum and then abruptly did a 180. <br>\n<br>\n2 and 3. I don't think it'd be unusual for a new town player to be interested in more information about a claim made and so by extension it's not that unthinkable that a rusty player would do the same thing. I also definitely disagree with what you said about forgetting game procedure but not game theory. Theory is much easier to forget. I used to be an avid chess player when I was younger and relatively decent for my age, but I stopped playing for a year or so. When I returned to the game, I wasn't as good as I used to be not because I forgot the game mechanics but because my strategy, tactics, and knowledge of theory were all weakened from being out of practice, and that did involve making quite a few newbie mistakes in my initial games.<br>\n<br>\nOf course, his previous actions are influencing my thought process on this quite a bit. If an already scummy player had done this, I might be less inclined to believe in the \"rusty player\" excuse because their previous actions would have established that they cannot be trusted that much. But since Oso is one of my stronger town reads, I'm more inclined to believe him. I also find it persuasive that the people leading his wagon are the ones I find scummiest. Two people I think are scum are on someone's wagon; hence, it is very likely that person is town.", "time": "Sat May 12, 2012 3:19 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=21920&start=200", "forum": "53", "thread": "21920"}

I nailed someone as scum off of gut feeling about one sentence at the end of a post once. And like nik said, certain things that can be nitpicked are scummy in certain contexts.

Don't bother with trying to draw connections between players until one of them is dead. It's tempting! but futile. </div></blockquote><br>\nThe most important word here is \"futile.\" Yes, you might wind up calling a pair of scum through a connection. But the odds of that are extremely low. There'll be more information on later days, so for now, we should just focus on people that we find scummy and not on connections. It's much, MUCH more difficult to identify a scummy connection on day one than it is to identify a scummy person. To prove that, suppose you're trying to identify a scummy person. Let's assume that you're town and that there are 13 total players, so 12 players other than you. Let's also assume 3 scum. Then you have a 25% chance of being right on any given player being scum. Now, consider a connection between two players. There are 11 + 10 + 9 + ... + 1 total possible connections amongst other players, or 66. Exactly 3 of those connections are between scum (scum A - scum B, scum A - scum C, scum B - scum C). So the probability that your connection will be right is 3/66 or 1/22, much lower than 1/4. More than that, you can relatively easily look at every single player in the game to find which ones are scummy - you can't easily look at every single connection in the game because there are so damn many of them. On later days, that isn't as true, however, because there will be flipped scum (and it's worth looking at their connections) and flipped town (who we won't spend as much time looking at). But most importantly is simply the fact that you're almost always going to be wrong on some of your reads, and connection hunting without flips assumes way too much about how good you are at reading people.

When active players have genuine scum reads, they of course tend to pursue those reads by asking questions, making points, analyzing posts and describing their resulting thoughts, etc., but Nik hasn't been displaying those about Oso even though he says he has a relatively strong scum read on him. <br>\n<br>\nRegarding Nik's post 40, I still find that to be one of his scummier posts. It's not so much that he didn't want to put a vote down at that moment that was scummy but rather the way he phrased his thinking for not doing so. As others have said, a vote with solid reasoning will always have pressure come with it, and saying that he didn't want to \"appear wishy-washy\" in order to avoid losing the pressure value of his vote feels like an excuse for not wanting to appear wishy-washy in order to not appear scummy. <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Implosion wrote:</cite>I'm also not saying that it isn't scummy (it's slightly scummy, maybe, but imo outweighed by towntells).</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nSomething about this just feels slightly off to me. There's nothing necessarily wrong with having a strong town read on someone outweigh a scummy aspect or post or something, but it feels a bit odd that you seem reluctant to say whether you think the post by itself is scummy by saying \"it's slightly scummy, maybe\".<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Implosion wrote:</cite>1) I see the \"pickiness\" in the code_x case as a towntell, for two reasons. First, Nik would do that as town (as the link illustrates). Second, it's less likely to come from scum because it likely attracts attention (which it has).<br>\n2) I think that the code_x case as a whole just seems genuine.<br>\n3) I buy the meta-shift thing. </div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nI don't really agree with these towntells. Numbers 2 and 3 are, of course, subjective, but for the first tell, I don't feel that such pickiness is a towntell. To me, pickiness isn't something that is particularly town-indicating or scum-indicating because it varies too much from case to case. In this specific case with Code_X and Nikanor, the aggressive attack over small nitpicky details in light of Nik's growing wagon seems like it's on the scummy side to me.", "time": "Wed May 16, 2012 1:48 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=21920&start=300", "forum": "53", "thread": "21920"}

Using formal logic. <br>\nNikanor can't be both town and scum. If I'm scum, then my interaction towards nikanor MUST be exactly one out of S--&gt;S or S--&gt;T. If I' town, then both of the lines of reasoning must be unsound (because they lead to false conclusions). So, let's assume for a moment that I'm scum.<br>\nThis means that at least one of those two lines of reasoning must be unsound. It could theoretically, even though i'm scum, be that both of them are unsound (i'll explain why if you want, in short, a false argument can lead to a true conclusion). However, let's assume for a minute that one line of reasoning is valid and sound.<br>\nNow, we KNOW that one of those two lines of reasoning is unsound. Therefore, either the \"if nik flips scum then implo is scum\" reasoning is flawed, or the \"if nik flips town then implo is scum\" reasoning is flawed. That's the definition of an unsound argument. Suppose that the first one is flawed. Then if nik flips scum, i can't be scum because of that reasoning. Suppose the second is flawed. Then if nik flips town, i can't be scum because of that reasoning. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Even before</div> nikanor flips, we KNOW, from a neutral point of view, that one of those lines of reasoning must be invalid. Now, as soon as Nikanor flips, anyone who wants to push on me can just say \"well, now we know which one is valid.\" That violates logical principles - seeing as we know RIGHT NOW that one of them must be unsound, we (meaning you) should be required to choose only one of them, seeing as adopting flawed arguments is logically impermissible. <br>\n<br>\nLet's take an analogy. A man is a suspect in two murder cases - however, the murders took place at exactly the same time in two very far-apart locations. Therefore, the man can't have committed both of them. Saying \"well, we'll just imprison him for whichever murder is solved second\" <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">is logically unacceptable.</div> This should be for obvious reasons. <br>\n<br>\nLet's further the analogy. A man is suspected of having carried out 1000 different murder cases - however, the murders took place at exactly the same time in 1000 very far-apart locations. The man can't have committed more than one of them. Saying \"the man committed whichever murder is solved last\" is, as before, logically unacceptable. This analogy should make that a little clearer. It's kind of like the monty hall dilemma. Sort of. Or maybe I just want it to be. In short, you know already that one of those lines of reasoning is flawed - waiting to see which one is eliminated as impossible doesn't automatically make the other one valid, and i'm damn sure that you and/or others will say that it does. If nik flips town, you'll just say \"oh well here's robb's reasoning for why implo is scum if nik flips town, i guess that was right.\" Doing this is intellectually dishonest, because you know that you're pushing a flawed argument.", "time": "Thu May 17, 2012 10:48 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=21920&start=350", "forum": "53", "thread": "21920"}

And with good reason. Nik calling it a tell implies it has been field tested, and his inability to back it up and subsequent backtracking was a good reason to vote him. 242 is weird because he calls Nik null and scum in the same post. Also says he can't make up his mind but doesn't seem to have qualms voting somebody else. His lynch list doesn't look too bad at this point in time, I would've PLed me too.

If he's scum, Oso and Code_X are probably town.<br>\n<br>\nOkay, today's main wagon. Personally, I found the early game fake scumtell and the subsequent backtrack (oh it hasn't even been tried but we have to start somewhere) suspect. 40 is another gem. He specifically states that he doesn't want to appear wishy washy which is scummy as to me. Another suspicious thing is how in post 97 he calls Oso a scumread but doesn't want to lynch him yet. I'm reading distancing from this. Also, after that, he proceeds to attack people by insulting them and waving his e-penis around (oh lol 6 games? Please.) Additionally, him claiming a playstyle change is scummy to me. A touch hypocritical, but the way he does it (do you want me to play like this or like that?) just sounds like eager to please scum. Despite all this, he pushes cases on Code_X and Oso who I believe are scum too.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"> Oso </div><br>\nScum.<br>\n<br>\nStarting off, everybody keeps saying he sounds town etc, so I tried to pay extra attention when reading the ISO. I don't know what the issue with early game votes/bandwagoning is, but w/e. Post 30 looks like scum trying to find a reason to vote. The deliberate misinterpretation of WMPE's \"random vote\" just looks too nit-picky to me. But these are minor points compared to 188 and 190. There is no reason for town to confirm whether or not the claims were real or fake. If he did it just once then MAYBE I'd let him off, but he asks for confirmation again in 190 which just did it for me.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"> Robbnva </div><br>\nTown.<br>\n<br>\nI don't need to explain this.

But after a night's sleep and a revisit, along with ISOing and cross referencing anything I can find that has to do with Nik, I can't see anything personally that would cause that fundamental a shift in a town player. Not enough that would cause him to unvote even an iffy scum read which he says Nik has gone to in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4052269#p4052269\" class=\"postlink\">Post 386</a>: <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">- Nik/Code...

Note that the first L-1 only lasts less than 12 hours (3:33am to 2:14pm, again by my timestamps). I suspect that had it actually went to claim possible hammer there, we'd have seen WMPE unvote there. Less than 12 hours at L-1, he could have missed it altogether.<br>\n<br>\nISO WMPE, it is less than a page so it can easily be opened in another window so I don't have to put all the links in and just read it.<br>\n<br>\nISO 7 (Post#121) He answers Nik about Zor, but not really. Lists 3 reason why he thinks folks might be worthy of attention. The thing here is that at least at that point, Zor would be a good place to park a vote should it be needed. At that point, Zor isn't participating much but also under no suspicion.<br>\n<br>\nIso 9 (Post#206) Takes vijay off the table as a vote. At that point, vijay is no longer 'safe' if he is a townie (which scum WPME would know) it looks like vijay might catch some heat even though he doesn't have any votes at that point, he had admitted to false claiming vig. Lists his two main reads as Nik (who has had pressure backed off of him for the earlier L-1) and Zoraster (who has had zero pressure at that point)<br>\n<br>\nFrom that point until his unvote, you don't hear much out of him but he does post enough to stay off the prod list.<br>\n<br>\nNow...\"Oh, shit\" Nik is about to go to lynch and he has no way to justify his vote. He can't use my case against Nik, he mentioned me as a distant scum read along with Nik and Zor as his main 2 reads. He can use Robb's but there is really nothing else he can up with on his own that isn't a rehash. Between Robb and I, there is 90% or more of the case on Nik. And Robb's case against Nik and mine are very similar.<br>\n<br>\nBut vijay, that vote is way more defensible. Even with vijay(town) a late day switch to vijay can be defended because pretty much vijay's play today can be described as scummy(worst) or VI/trollish(best).<br>\n<br>\nWMPE is panicked scum. He doesn't want to be in on a townie lynch with no way to defend his vote. vijay is the ONLY viable alternative if you are going to take your vote off your main scum read as he is about to be lynched.<br>\n<br>\n(Apologies for the length of this post)", "time": "Fri May 18, 2012 6:30 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=21920&start=425", "forum": "53", "thread": "21920"}

Triangle in 15 also ignores the now 3 votes on Implosion. Defending Implosion perhaps. 16 also ignores the 3 votes on Implosion. Why? Instead Nikanor votes Gorckat for a pathetic reason.</div></blockquote><br>\n(the numbers are added by me).<br>\n(1) So the first non-random vote gets townpoints from him. This is scummy for a few reasons. One, there's no reason that townies are any more likely to make a first random vote than scum would be - ergo, it's at best bad scumhunting, and at worst faked scumhunting. But the real reason that it's scummy is the next sentence - he says that the RVS is a waste of time, and people piss him off by prolonging it. First of all, \"it pisses me off\" or \"it's unhelpful\" is a completely invalid reason to say \"it's scummy\" or \"not doing it is a towntell.\" Second of all, Code made an RVS vote himself - this leads to a dichotomy. Either he's lying about his opinion on the RVS stage (unlikely) or he's exaggerating severely. Why does he have to be exaggerating? Well, if he isn't, then his actions are wholly incongruous. He said that he views the RVS as a \"complete\" waste of time - if he views it as a COMPLETE waste of time, then he has no reason whatsoever to participate in it. If he doesn't actually view it as a complete waste of time, then he's exaggerating for the sake of exaggerating, which is scummy in and of itself. <br>\n<br>\n(2) First of all, lol iioa. Saying \"Robb also votes implosion\" is IIoA, which is a classic scumtell, and unlike a lot of other classic scumtells (like omgus), actually works. IIoA is the scum's attempt to look helpful, or bolster how helpful they look. Saying that what Vijay did is \"interesting\" is *also* iioa, because \"interesting\" implies absolutely nothing about what he thinks of it in terms of is it scummy/is it a towntell. But the real important thing here is what exactly he's criticizing vijay for - he's criticizing vijay for ignoring a specific thing. Now, this criticism (at least i'm assuming it's criticism, again, see the point that we don't even know if it is criticism) is scummy for two reasons. First, look at the post from vijay in question. All it contains is a random vote and a \"/confirm if i still need to.\" Criticizing someone for what they didn't do in a confirm post is not only ludicrous, it's reaching. There's no reason to criticize it, or even find it really notable, unless you're actively looking for things to criticize. Finding it scummy (if he does) is even more ridiculous. It's a confirmation post - seriously. Second, criticizing someone for what ISN'T in their post is in and of itself bad scumhunting. That's like saying \"well, implosion didn't comment on nikanor being put at L-1 - i find that interesting.\" Or \"Well, Gorkcat didn't comment on implosion's Shotty case - i find that interesting.\" Not commenting on something that has NOTHING WHATSOEVER to do with you isn't scummy or even notable. It's, once again, reaching. <br>\n<br>\n(3) Once again, he continues criticizing people for what isn't in their posts. In fact, he construes triangle ignoring the wagon on me as defending me. So... let's think about this for a second. triangle makes no mention whatsoever of the bandwagon on me. This is apparently defending me, because... saying nothing on the matter makes the bandwagon go away? saying nothing on the matter is a form of saying that i'm town? saying nothing on the matter is a way of voting someone on the wagon (OH WAIT, triangle <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">didn't even vote someone on my wagon</div>). So, once again, this is really, REALLY reaching. It makes no sense whatsoever to call this \"defending.\" Nikanor's already beaten the last sentence to death on why it's scummy. <br>\n<br>\nThat post as a whole (and i'm not even going to comment on the rest of it, again, i think nik already has) is, as nik said and i want to reinforce, trying to comment on everything, which is scummy. Townies realize that they have no need to comment on every (or on the vast majority of) post(s). When i was in one of my first scumgames, i did almost the exact same thing, which I linked. Yes, me doing it in that game doesn't make codex scum in this game. But the similarity is really kind of remarkable. <br>\n<br>\nI'm gonna focus the rest of this post on more recent stuff. <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>As for a re-read I've read back and viewed everyone briefly in isolation. At this point I'm still happy with a Nikanor lynch - he's pretty much tied himself to thinking I'm scum based on a few supposed tells he's had success with before. His marked change in style of play screams to me of someone who knew he'd be strung up for the weak/passive play and then has turned super aggressive and contrived a case.</div></blockquote><br>\nSo nikanor-scum knew he'd be strung up for passive play... and did it anyway. SCUM, whose sole goal is to AVOID being lynched, did something that they knew would GET THEM strung up. Yeah, i'm not buying that as a genuine thought process. <br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Of the rest I'm looking more at WMPE (newbie/somewhat lurky), Implosion (on his wagon), Zoraster (had also been on his wagon) and Shotty (lurker). </div></blockquote><br>\nhrmhrmhrm<br>\nAlso note that he's \"taking note\" of EVERY player who has voted him (outside the rvs at least).<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>WMPE because he seems intent on casting dirt and then running away. He's almost waiting for someone to find something to hop on. </div></blockquote><br>\nUnlike you, who will hop on people for not saying things.<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Implosion - just feels like he's playing a subtle kind of game and sticking up for Nikanor. Whether it's because he knows his alignment or he's trying to keep him alive. May be a bit of OMGUS on my part here aswell.</div></blockquote><br>\nSo yeah this observation is really deep and intricate and original - unlike anyone else in the game, he noticed that i was defending nikanor. And then he basically went on to say that I could be town or scum because of it. Or to paraphrase his read on me in this post: \"I'm taking note of implosion. He's defended nikanor, which could come from town or scum. I might be OMGUSing too.\" I'm not even sure if he finds me scummy based on this. <br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Shotty appears distant and somewhat cautious. Scummy as such. He's had Nik near the top of his suspects throughout the game yet seems concerned to vote. </div></blockquote><br>\nAs much as I don't want to connection hunt... god, this just sticks out to me. It feels like he's yelling at Shotty to stop lurking and stop looking indecisive. <br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>As for Nikanor's latest post. I think a townie would care more. Then again I think scum would also give a bit more of a staunch defence, he's almost given up/no longer caring. It's a defeatist attitude and almost seems like he's gone back to his original playstyle of meek and passive instead of ultra aggressive. He's still the person I feel most strongly about being scum.</div></blockquote><br>\n\"I think a townie wouldn't act like this. I also think scum wouldn't act like this.\" Those are his first two sentences here. He can't even decide what stance he wants to take. Nik also mentioned something like that a while ago. Yes, he winds up taking the stance \"nik is scum.\" He does it, however, in a really unnecessarily roundabout way. <br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Regards you and Robb. He is acting pro-town or appears to be you aren't. You don't claim vig even as a joke on page 8 or whenever it was.

To me, it feels less like an inconsistency in reads and more like infrequent posting but active reading of the game, which implies that his opinion may have changed about Vijay and Nik and his latest voting action is reflecting that. I don't think it's too far-fetched that he would be swayed by the recent cases built up on Vijay, and his lurking seems like a combination of occupations in real life and perhaps new player tendencies. <br>\n<br>\nThis is partially my gut speaking here, but WMPE feels much more like new town here than inconsistent or flip-flopping scum. Regardless, I certainly don't think he should be our lynch for today, especially in light of Nik and Vijay. That said, WMPE, I do agree with earlier posters that you should explain your reasoning for finding Vijay scummy now.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Oso wrote:</cite><br>\nThat is why I wish to know his reasoning because WHY he did it directly affects how I will personally proceed next.

Oso, why did you choose to unvote Nikanor purely because WMPE decided he was scummy, especially since he did not provide reasoning for this choice? <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Robbnva wrote:</cite>the last time I saw a person delay making a case until the last minute was scum, so I am all for a vijay lynch.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Robbnva wrote:</cite>errr wrong answer<br>\n<br>\nVote: Vijay</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nI disagree with both of these reasons for voting for Vijay. The more I think about it, the more his apathy for the game seems like a complete null tell and something that could go either way. He could be a town player overcome by laziness or a scum player who's partially given up, so I'm hesitant to read too much into his somewhat of a disregard for the game. <br>\n<br>\nI'm also really not seeing how he's scummy for deciding to post reads on all the players. I've done this in the past as a way to re-familiarize myself with all the events that have transpired throughout the game, organize my thoughts, and do some extra analysis and see if anything new jumps out at me. <br>\n<br>\nThat said, the actual reads he posted on the iso's of the players are the doing the opposite of making me see him as townier. Most of the cases he wrote were somewhat incoherent and illogical, and often focused on small details that aren't particularly convincing. They came across as a bit contrived and shallow, not to mention the rather odd VI ploy he seems to be attempting to pull.<br>\n<br>\nI still prefer a Nik lynch to Vijay, but if the deadline approaches and there's no movement back to a Nik wagon, I'll be satisfied with a Vijay lynch. For now, I'll keep my vote where it is, especially taking into consideration the upcoming replacement and the extended deadline.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>gorckat wrote:</cite><br>\nI think it works in towns favor to lynch vijay, even if vijay is town and Nik is scum (policy reasons and game theory/WIFOM outs).</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nWhat does this mean?

Having trouble figuring out whether you're terrible town or stupid scum. Because implying \"when zoraster posts and shows himself to be scum\" is idiotic. It's bullhonky weaseling. Either man up and vote me because you obviously think I'm scum or react when I actually say something scummy. You're obviously working backwards from your desired result here, and that's pretty damning. <br>\n<br>\nBecause let's be perfectly clear: just because you post a lot doesn't mean you're helping town. All this stuff is just so much distraction. And your implication that you can somehow catch me in a lie is absurd. I doubt you even have an idea how you'd do that, but you think it <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">sounds</div> good, so you say it. And that's a pretty good indication of scum. <br>\n<br>\n2. I don't even begin to know what you mean by \"info.\" <br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\nVijay should 100% be the lynch today. This isn't the same situation before where I was okay with either Code or implosion's lynch. I still think there's a high probability of scum there, but it matters little because if we don't lynch Vijay we're making a large mistake. <br>\n<br>\nNow that he's claimed VT, you need to actively explain why we SHOULDN'T lynch him today. His latest posts have been incredibly scummy, especially where he plays the VI card. He looks and feels caught scum. But let's say you're on the fence on him, 50/50 say rather than the 90/10 I am. You should STILL support this lynch with all your heart because not doing so is a detriment to the town because it helps scum. <br>\n<br>\nIf you BELIEVE vijay, fine. But you need to actually say so rather than just saying, \"yeah, yeah. he could be scum, but this other guy is MORE probably scum.\" Because the guy has claimed VT now and is of little use even if he IS town, which is pretty darn unlikely. Because as town he reduces the pool of players that town has to shoot at to find a power role, he'll stick around, and then we'll STILL have to make a decision on him at some point in the future. We can't even use \"well, he might be scum because he's still alive\" because of COURSE he'll still be alive. <br>\n<br>\nFrankly, the resistance to vijay's lynch is astounding.

I unvoted because WMPE unvoted, I was bit mad at his play (not very mature, I'll admit) but mainly because up until that point, Nik had been at the top of every scum list WMPE had made. It set bells off because there was no reason given for the unvote. Absent any information, I made the snap assumption that WMPE saw something in the thread that put his read of Nik in doubt OR that he didn't want to be on a Nik lynch. Both could be valid, both could point to new information (or at least a re-interpretation of old information) that I didn't see myself. So my unvote there was almost mandatory, at least in my mind. There were still plenty of votes out there to get Nik to lynch but by unvoting, I took that number from two votes up to three. Not a great buffer but a decent one.<br>\n<br>\nAfter re-reading everything I could that had anything to do with nik, I couldn't personally find a reason that would make a townie take his vote off one his strongest stated scum suspects so near a lynch and a scum certainly wouldn't unvote a buddy in that situation. That only left me with a scum who didn't want to be in on a townie lynch.<br>\n<br>\nThat is assumption I went with, and I'm going to stick with until I get something solid from WMPE.

Gorcat and Zoraster get the most attention cause they were late voters.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nI'm not really seeing the case on Zoraster, and a second look at his iso actually makes him seem more town to me. His comment of \"Welcome, friends\" seems more like an innocuous greeting rather than some attempt to make everyone like him, especially since it's not as if referring to people you don't know with a blanket \"friends\" statement will actually make them feel more favorable towards you. <br>\n<br>\nAs for his vote-hopping, in this particular case, I'm more inclined to actually see this as a somewhat townish action. I believe someone may have stated this earlier in the game (perhaps it was Tierce?), and I feel it applies here to Zoraster: sometimes so much vote hopping can be indicative of a town mindset since scum would rather not be blatantly switching around their vote so much. Furthermore, a scum would typically not really have any reason to change votes, whereas a good town player is always thinking and re-evaluating the validity of their current vote. The fact that Zoraster changed back and forth between Implosion and Code_X in the absence of pressure makes it look to me like he's thinking about which player is a better choice.<br>\n<br>\nThis is a somewhat weak argument, but as another note, I think it's quite likely Nikanor and Code_X have opposing alignments, and quite likely that Nikanor and Implosion have the same alignment. The fact that Zoraster is conflicted between Implosion and Code_X, two people I believe have opposing alignments since I think Nikanor is scum, lends more credence to the idea that he's town. Of course, this is not my main reason for thinking of him as town right now since much of this is speculation, but I just wanted to point that out.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Zoraster wrote:</cite>You should STILL support this lynch with all your heart because not doing so is a detriment to the town because it helps scum.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nWhat do you mean by this? <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Oso wrote:</cite>If I understand what you are asking, I didn't unvote Nikanor becasue WMPE thought Nik was scummy.

I already explained my issues with the nik wagon, I had a gut feeling something was wrong with that wagon cause there was no real counter, which to me meant this was a wagon pushed on by scum plus we had a replacement coming in and tons of other players not contributing. Than vijay goes off the deep end and I had already had a scum read on him, but when I realized that almost every single person I thought was scummy, was on his wagon plus how quickly it formed, I knew there was no way I wanted to be part of that wagon.<br>\n<br>\n2. your \"evidence\" is weak. my vote wasn't technically on him, but it was implied. I still wanted him to claim. And I wasn't worried about scum coming in hammering, more so I was worried about some lose cannon townie hammering without a claim (seen it billions of times on the site where I normally play and I have seen it here, pretty sure I have hammered somebody without a claim before a time or two. Not proud of it, but it's happened. so not worried about scum hammering, scum hammer without a claim would just make them look bad.)<br>\n<br>\n3. I had re-voted nik in 275, I only unvoted to give Tierce a proper time to catchup. My vote was still implied on nik, so why does it matter if my vote is techincally on him or not when I ask why we are at a stand still? Nobody else had any intention of voting nik so even if I had put my vote back we would have still been at a stand still..<br>\n<br>\n4. I don't hammer nik, cause never never reaches L-1 again without my vote on him (at least I don't recall he does) if he had gotten to L-1 I would have absolutely hammered him, cause I said early on I would prefer to hammer nik rather than putting him at L-1<br>\n<br>\nthere, I feel I have accurately answered your questions, so this is now where we are at.<br>\n<br>\nwe have 2 people possibly being lynched who have claimed VTs and me who as far as you know is still claiming to be the vig, a role that if I am telling the truth can be verified without actually lynching me.<br>\n<br>\nearlier you wanted vijay and i to confirm our claims, now you would rather vote one of the claimed PRs instead of a scummy VT claim....<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nI'd like to apologize to vijay, you are dead on right that Oso was trying to role fish. sorry about that.

You explain how the problem with code_x is that nobody you \"trust\" has made a case on him. Based on post 513 and your subsequent oso vote, the list of people you \"trust\" (and by \"trust,\" I apparently mean \"have a null read on,\" since you apparently don't have any townreads) is split, triangle, code, and shotty. Code isn't going to make a case on himself. Shotty's lurked himself into being replaced. Split has made a grand total of, on average, one post per two pages of this game, with a grand total of one post that can be construed as a case. It's incongruous, but more than that, it's bordering on just being childish. <br>\n<br>\nSo I guess what I'm saying is this. I'm not calling you scummy for this (at least not yet) - I want that to be clear. But three things.<br>\n1) cut the bullshit about fossing everyone in the game. Yeah, you've probably got some fosses on scum. Care to tell us which ones?<br>\n2) cut the bullshit about changing your top scumread every three seconds (usually for petty reasons, like changing Oso from your strongest townread to strongest scumread for rolefishing). Changing fosses is fine. Going (not literally, but essentially) from \"vijay is confscum\" to \"nik is confscum\" to \"zoraster is confscum\" to \"oso is confscum\" is not. <br>\n3) cut the bullshit about not trusting anyone. Mafia is a game of trust. If you say \"I think that A, B, C, D, E and F are the scummiest people in the game,\" you implicitly state \"I think that G, H, I, J, K and L are the towniest people in the game.\" Listen to what everyone says - when you have so fucking many scumreads, MOST OF THEM ARE GOING TO BE WRONG. So stop using \"no one i trust has made a codex case\" as an excuse to by-and-large ignore him. <br>\n<br>\nIf you think that vijay and oso are being antitown... no. You, Robbnva, are being antitown by antagonizing the majority of the player list. Remember when Nikanor said that he didn't want to change his vote because it'd lose its pressure value? Yeah, well guess how much pressure I feel by being fossed by you? Zilch. Guess how much pressure I'm going to guess the rest of your fosses feel from you? Probably also zilch. So not just from a standpoint of \"it's starting to antagonize people,\" but also from a practical standpoint: stop fossing half the game, stop being wishy-washy and make up your damn mind.", "time": "Sun May 20, 2012 2:54 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=21920&start=525", "forum": "53", "thread": "21920"}

Let's say that the game hasn't started yet. Based on the logic of \"everyone is guilty until proven innocent,\" <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">you should have fossed everyone before they posted.</div> This, obviously, is contradictory, because there is no way in hell that everyone is scum. A much more internally consistent outlook that's still consistent with the \"i think towntells are rare\" sentiment would be something like vollkan used to do - he listed everyone in the game as having a number. Everyone started at 50. 100 meant confirmed scum, 0 meant confirmed town. Any time someone scumtold, he'd give them points. Any time someone towntold, he'd lower their score. He also made a note that he tended to give more points than he took away - which he did. However, guilty until proven innocent is completely ridiculous in this sense.<br>\n<br>\nPoint two: mafia is a proofless game. There is never, EVER, proof in mafia. You're a cop with a guilty, you say? Could be framed. Someone claimed scum, you say? They might be a vengeful townie. You watched someone who claimed VT visit the nightkill, you say? There could be some new role in the game that can cause false positives on tracker/watcher reports. Point is, no one will EVER be proven innocent. Now, i know that what you really mean is \"guilty until they've towntold.\" This is also fallacious - not all townies will towntell at all, and those that do won't always towntell in ways that everyone sees. We'll just lynch anyone who doesn't towntell, you say? Well, some of those people will be town. Perhaps the majority. Perhaps enough that lynching all of them will give the mafia a majority. Point here is, you can't say that people have to towntell to be town. It's simply inconsistent with empirical reality.<br>\n<br>\nPoint three (most important, probably): practicality. There are several goals of being a townie. One of those goals is, of course, to scumhunt properly. What is scumhunting properly? Well, I'd argue that the goal is to have as many correct reads as possible and as few incorrect reads as possible. To that end, having <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">significantly</div> more scumreads than there can potentially be scum in the game is fallacious. Sure, you could counter-argue and say that the only read that's important is the one that you're currently pushing on to get lynched. Of course, you can't argue this, because you've pushed heavily on about 5 different people throughout today and changed your opinion on a dime over and over. But regardless, it's anti-town to have incorrect reads. Reads influence people. Influencing people to have false opinions is patently antitown. I'm not saying that you should always have EXACTLY 3 scumreads and EXACTLY 10 townreads - but when you have stated scumreads on 2/3 of the people that could be scum from your point of view... you get the point.</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\nNow that that's out of the way, let's look at the rest of your post. <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>imp - almost every one of your posts seem cautious, it seems like you are doing your very best to sound town without rocking the vote. this is exactly how I play as scum. so that's why my gut read on you</div></blockquote><br>\nFirst of all i really doubt that you play in the way that you've described as scum - you'd be *ridiculously* easy to catch through meta if that were true. But second of all, this is a really inaccurate description of my play. Saying that I haven't been \"rocking the vote\" is just plain wrong. If you mean i haven't been aggressive, false - i've made cases on codex and shotty and pushed both of them. If you mean I haven't been doing anything that runs counter to popular opinion/counter to the strong voices of the town, PATENTLY false - I've decried every single bandwagon today, and I just called you, the loudest poster in this game, out for being terrible. So... yeah, this is incongruent with reality. <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>vijay - he sheeps twice, as town there is no motivation to sheep. When I call him out on it he freaks out, claims vig and accuses me of reacting to pressure that I was never under (there is no town motivation for this)</div></blockquote><br>\nYes, there is very good motivation to sheep as town. 1: because you believe the other person's vote/case. 2: laziness (GASP, TOWNIES CAN BE LAZY? HOLY SHIT I ONLY THOUGHT SCUM CAN BE LAZY BUT ALAS IT'S TRUE). 3: because you think the person you're sheeping is town and you want their vote to have more pressure (read: people who proxy their votes). 4: RVS bandwagoning to accrue tells. 5: just doing it for the hell of it (GASP, TOWNIES CAN DO THINGS WITHOUT ANY SPECIFIC REASON? HOLY SHIT I THOUGHT ONLY SCUM DID THAT). Next, him claiming vig isn't a scumtell - it's a \"bad/new player\" tell. Plus, he actually said that he was trolling the first half of the game... so yeah. <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><br>\nnikanor - I have already said over and over why I think he is scum.</div></blockquote><br>\n:shrug:<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><br>\nZoraster - lack of scum hunting, shows up twice out of the blue and hops on a wagon. now he acts like he is the most obvious town when he isn't.

Plus when I accuse him of lurking, he has a nice excuse waiting already instead of being apologetic.</div></blockquote><br>\nLack of scumhunting, eh? Might i redirect you to that frankly beautiful and recent post where he called you out for being incongruous with your own town meta? You know the one where he cited several completed games? If that isn't scumhunting then I really don't know what is. Showing up out of the blue and hopping on wagons isn't scummy either - especially if votes are justified, and even if they aren't, it doesn't make the voter scum.

I got called out for asking both vijay and robb to clarify just what the hell was going on with the claims while both continued to play with it themselves. I know I backed off on asking again, if anyone should be looking for a contradiction from me, but that was back when Robb was rising in my estimation as town. That changed later.<br>\n<br>\nOf the 4 players in this game that I suspect might be scum right now: Robb, vijay2, Nik and WMPE, The most usable-later info, for me at least, comes from a vijay flip and since he has done things scummy enough to warrant a flip any additional info we get from his flip is a nice bonus. Plus, it allows Robb a chance to prove him claim which is what I get the impression most folks are thinking in regards to him. Since vijay stands on his own as scummy, just add the back and forth I posted above as my reason why I think vijay makes a good lynch to those already stated by others in the thread so far. <br>\n<br>\nNik stands on his own if I don't look too closely at what was going on around him at the time of his near lynch, but I did so I'm less sure of the read I have on him now than I was when he was claimed and at L-1.<br>\n<br>\nWMPE, I read the game he referenced. He is just what he looks like, a newb from what I could tell and I've never had any luck reading newbies. A WMPE flip of scum would pretty much confirm, at least to me, Nik's towniness but aside from that, he has not done anything egregious enough to warrant flipping him simply because it might confirm a read on another player. If he(WMPE) flipped town, it would only tell me that I had advocated the lynch of newbie who did nothing more than pick a piss-poor time to leave a wagon.

On the one hand, some people have made good points about the fact that his vote has been flopping all over the place and preventing lynches from occurring, and he has been making some claims about people that border dangerously on misrepresentation and misquoting/taking quotes out of context. <br>\n<br>\nHowever, what stops me from having him as a scum read is that sometimes vote hopping isn't necessarily an indication of scum behavior. Somewhat indecisive town (as Robbnva appears to be, judging from his rather lengthy list of scum reads - and this isn't a bad thing, necessarily) will always tend to be rethinking their votes, especially in light of new information, and so many vote changes suggests that the person casting the votes is actively thinking and changing opinions about who should be the right lynch. Scum doesn't really change opinions; town do because they're the ones attempting to determine who is scum and who is not.<br>\n<br>\nFurthermore, I can't really see a scum motivation for his vigilante counterclaim. That would be an enormously risky move for scum to pull because it can be so easily proven or contradicted based on the night kills. Oso mentioned something about how Robbnva could say he's a one-shot vig, but somewhere (I forget where at the moment) Robbnva said something along the lines of \"people would notice something suspicious if there was only one nightkill every night\" (not a quote, just paraphrasing), which precludes the possibility of him later claiming one-shot vig.<br>\n<br>\nFor now, I still consider Robbnva town but he's closer to the scum side of the spectrum than he was before. Either way, he definitely is not a good lynch for Day 1 because claimed power roles, particularly in light of other prospects, are generally not the way to go here.

Knee jerk reaction, WMPE either saw something I didn't OR is scum bailing. Since no reason given I assumed scum bailing after thinking on it some.<br>\n</li><li>Reason later given: Nik's lynch isn't going anywhere and I saw he might have a point. (This mentioned because it ties into the next.)</li></ul><br>\n<br>\nRobb/vijay: Off WMPE on then off Robb onto vijay.<br>\n<ul><li>Robb's three posts after Nik at L-1 with no mention of RC or Hammer of Nik while poking at vijay. Tierce was also poking at vijay before Nik's RC so on the surface, it looked like, to me at least, Robb might being trying to goad/push a townie into into hammering another townie (I've done this myself as scum).<br>\n</li><li>Robb's claim. I'm still sure about it, he isn't a vig. He is lying. But since it seems that vijay and Robb are joined at the hip on that claim, I am certain that one's flip will bear directly on the alignment of the other. When vijay flips scum, so will Robb.<br>\n</li><li>Robb, my preferred lynch for the day, isn't going to be lynched and I can't say I can really argue with the reason's a couple of folks have put forth. There is at least an opportunity to be able to prove it without lynching him even though in Robb's case, I do think it is a waste of time.</li></ul><br>\n<br>\nRe Nik: I can't argue with any of the reason of the folks(ex:Robb at the moment and that isn't his reasoning, just his motivations) that are voting him, esp. since a decent portion of the reasons were put forth by me when I was voting him. Unless WMPE ever flips scum before Nik is flipped, Nik remains a viable scum candidate with me. <br>\n<br>\nMy feeling right now is that vijay and Robb are both scum.

I think it's absurd made more absurd by the fact that it's a VIG claim. But as the quotes show, this is something Robbnva clearly believes. The goal here isn't to try and determine what you or I would do in a situation, but what he would do. And he gives us those tools. <br>\n<br>\nAnd you seem to be missing the fundamental detail here: despite his protests to the otherwise, I don't think he believed vijay was faking at all.<br>\n<br>\nConsider that implication. Let's say that Robbnva wanted to trade himself, a goon, for a vig. He CCs the vig claim hoping to get rid of the vig before it gets a chance to fire even once. Because  in his world, this is a great trade  for scum to make (see quotes).  BUT THEN vijay backs award. He declares that he ISN'T a vig but is rather just a simple VT.  <br>\n<br>\nSo now where is scum-Robb? He's left either pushing a lynch on vijay a VT or backing off. Consider what this means:<br>\n1. He can't trade himself for the power role because vijay isn't a power role<br>\n2. Vijay can stick around and be mislynched the next day.<br>\n3. He can try and find some other power role.<br>\n<br>\nTHINK ABOUT THIS and think about those quotes. Those quotes mean that Robb thinks the MOST important thing that a scum can do to win is to eliminate power roles. What would you do if your motivation was to eliminate power roles?<br>\n<br>\nYou'd do whatever you could to identify roles. You'd run up as many people as you think is reasonable and get them to claim. Once someone claims a power role, you lynch them or you kill them. Even if you can't get a power role to claim, you'd narrowed the field of players who might BE a VT. In the case of a vig, you want to prevent the power from going off.* Does that sound like what he did. YES IT DOES. <br>\n<br>\n*Consider that a vig's power is one of the only ones that has its benefit vest at NIGHT before a mafia kill can stop it.

Especially given the repreated aforementioned (at least in this post) point that there was no need (or benefit??) for scum to cc.<br>\n<br>\n@zoraster...<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4078126#p4078126\">in this post</a> you say scum <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">\"Robb views his primary responsibility as identifying and eliminating PRs before they can do harm to his team.\"</div><br>\n<br>\n- If he thought vijay was telling the truth and actually was a vig, why would he need to counter when scum could just NK viajy? - If he thought vijay was lying (as he claims), why would he counter as a vig? What PR could he hope to out with his claim? If there was a real vig would that player be inclined to throw a 3rd Vig claim into the mix? I think not. More likely a real vig would just NK one of the fakeclaimers. And no other potential PR would have had any reason to out themselves. So how was scum Robb accomplishing his <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">\"primary responsibility\"</div>? (I really should read all the way through before commenting as Robb makes the same points in his post 777).<br>\n<br>\nOK...so in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4078204#p4078204\">Post 779</a> zoraster sums his Robb suspicions up by claiming Robb CCd the vig in order to get the vig lynched. Why out yourslef to get a vig lynched when you could just carry on with what turned out to be a Nik mislynch and eliminate the vig at night? This argument against Robb makes no sense.<br>\n<br>\nI like the suspicions on zoraster for what I see as a faulty case put forth on Robb...however, Robb then pushes a similar case against vijay. @Robb...why would scum vijay claim vig? If he is scum he doesn't know there is a vig (though he might be able to assume there is one based on possible scum PRs). I kind of took his vig claim as a joke...similar to the numerous times I have seen people make comments D1 like <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">daykill: vijay</div> etc. perhaps somewhat as a joke towards an annoyance (which vijay may have viewed you as). Basically I see no reason for scum to fakeclaim vig initially or as a counterclaim.<br>\n<br>\nRegarding <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4078726#p4078726\">Post 785</a> where Robb asks us to answer his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4078255#p4078255\">town motivation question</a>:<br>\n<br>\nThe question is slightly tainted by the fact that when vijay <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4030614#p4030614\">claimed he was a vig</a>...he only had one vote on him (by Robb), who ironically immediately unvoted vijay in the next post and placed his first vote on Nik...which put Nik at L-1. (???) So how was vijay under \"pressure\" when he claimed he was going to vig you?<br>\n<br>\nBack to your town motivation question though...he wasn't under pressure IMO so there was no motivation one way or the other to fakeclaim. If he was under serious pressure I could see there being scum motivation to fakeclaim in order to avoid a lynch and perhaps out a real vig. But I don't see that as being the circumstances at the point vijay said he would vig you.<br>\n<br>\nRegarding <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4079815#p4079815\">Post 810</a> by vijay....what shit did you hope would go down as a result of your \"softclaim?\" And yes I have been reading. Sadly I do not have total recall and you and Robb have been generating a lot of material...much of which doesn't need to be posted.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">tl:dr;</div>I'm not convinced either vijay or Robb are scum wrt their vig claims but if I could only pick one of them as being town it would probably be vijay. One..because I see no purpose him making the initial claim as scum and two, because if scum really did think Robb was a vig (as he was countering to vijay and did not reveal otherwise until D2)...then why is Robb still alive? I also am not liking zoraster's case on Robb as mentioned above (regardless of Robb's alignment).<br>\n<br>\nWho are my top two this time? Probably Robb and zoraster. Also...looking back at Robb's <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4056908#p4056908\">last D1 vote on vijay</a>, Robb concedes that vijay could be trolling town, reprimands zoraster for putting vijay at L-2 <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">\"out of nowhere\"</div> and then proceeds to put vijay at L-1!

My preferred style isn't making large wall posts but I tend towards that, particularly in this game, because I'm busy and only have the opportunity to write out a post once, maybe twice a day. Because of this, my posts are generally long because they include my thoughts from what's happened since I last posted. What do you mean, I've done very little to pressure my reads? I was the first (maybe second, not entirely sure right now) person to post a full case on Nik.<br>\n<br>\nIt is extremely likely that there is at least one scum on the final votecount under Nik just prior to his lynch. The people were: triangle123, splitfarvle, Code_X, Robbnva, havingfitz, vijay2vasandani, Oso (in that order). Robbnva and Oso are among my stronger town reads for reasons I've given earlier. I still stand by what I said about not being able to find a scum motivation for Robbnva's fake counterclaim, and he does seem to be making a genuine effort at scumhunting.<br>\n<br>\nI described Vijay as one of my stronger scum reads Day 1, but I'm now beginning to reconsider that. Most of my reasons for thinking he was scummy seemed to center around the idea that he was playing poorly, essentially raging at Robbnva over small arguments, trolling, and pulling the Village Idiot card, but reading over his posts, his suspicious play seems to stop at that. In other words, he appears to be playing poorly, but not scummily. <br>\n<br>\nCode_X remains a town read of mine.<br>\n<br>\nLooking at havingfitz's iso: I was a bit confused by <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4061905#p4061905\" class=\"postlink\">Post 626</a> because although I could be interpreting this incorrectly, it seems like the first paragraph was more going towards Vijay being town, and the second suggested he's scum.

Fitz, if you think Robbnva is scum, why do you think he counterclaimed?<br>\n<br>\nLooking through Split's iso: It's difficult to tell if this is due to time constraints on his posting, but many of Split's posts seem to have little content. For instance, his initial post about Nikanor read as somewhat forced and repeated points that other people had brought up. He also doesn't really follow up on certain things he brings up. For example, he wrote:<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Split wrote:</cite><br>\nI really don't want a hammer yet, I want to reread the thread and have a think about the new Nik.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nBut then never actually followed up on that. <br>\n<br>\nSplit, what do you think about Robbnva right now?

My limited experience with vijay has not shown him in a very good light.  In my catch up for this game I was seeing the same bad play.  When I made the comment I was under the impression there was a vig in the game and I was hoping vijay would draw the vig's kill.  As it now appears there is no vig we are probably stuck with him.  I agree his recent play has been an improvement (at least it is IMO).  It probably bordered on a policy vi lynch but as his play has been more palatable and there are people I suspect more than him...so I'm not pursuing him at this time.<br>\n<br>\nAs for Robb's counterclaim...I do not like it from a scumRobb or a townRobb perspective.

{"number": 935, "id": "4091789", "user": "triangle123", "user_id": "16805", "content": "I'm back, and I've read the posts that were made while I was gone. Since Oso has been one of my top town reads for more or less the entire game, I definitely do believe his claim, so that makes him and Split confirmed town for me now. There's almost certainly at least one scum on the final Nikanor wagon as I've said earlier, but having Split as almost definite town makes narrowing down the choices a lot easier. <br>\n<br>\nAs I've said, Oso and Split are basically town, and I still have a decently strong Robbnva town read. Vijay is not exactly the best player to have around and I'm not a fan of his self-proclaimed village idiot actions, but he has not done anything to really make me suspect he's scum. I'm not comfortable using a lynch on him unless the deadline is too close and we don't have any other valid choices. I did decide to take another look at Code_X, though.<br>\n<br>\nCode_X has been a tentative town read of mine for much of the game, but I reread his iso more closely than I did before. Most people who have made cases on him called his original catch-up post scummy because it consisted of mostly summary, and I still maintain that I don't think the fact that he summarized is suspicious. The part he put in spoilers seemed primarily to serve as his personal notes as he read, and I generally take similar notes on a Word document while I read and they do tend to be almost all summary. I also don't find his vote on Nikanor suspicious because he did point out a few scummy facets of Nikanor's play in his catch-up and his reasoning seemed okay there. <br>\n<br>\nHowever, what does jump out to me now that I didn't notice before is that he had a lot of evidence on Nik, which is why it makes sense for him to say Nik is his top scum read, but then he wrote that Nik is \"closely followed by Split\". But going back to the catch-up portion of his post, the only point he makes against Split is that he random-voted a little bit after RVS ended despite the fact that he does make some other points against other people. It'd be different if he had said that Split was one of his scum reads or a weaker read or something of that nature, but he singled out Split and implied that he's a strong scum read. <br>\n<br>\nAnother thing I noticed is something I believe Nikanor had pointed out at some point, but I hadn't been following his case on Code_X too closely because I was so sure Nik was scum. In a response to Nik, Code_X had written the following:<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Code_X wrote:</cite><br>\nYour barking completely up the wrong tree and your wishy-washy early style of cautious play and trying to avoid confontation has turned into an ultra-aggressive style completely the opposite in the hope of saving your own skin.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nThe phrase \"barking up the wrong tree\" would imply that Nikanor is town. This is a small point and certainly not the basis for my changed read on Code_X but this does feel like a minor scumslip to me.<br>\n<br>\nWhat also strikes me as scummy is the fact that Code_X tunneled very hard on Nikanor for much of Day 1 without it actually feeling like tunneling. By this I mean that almost all his posts centered around attacks on Nikanor and he had minimal commentary on other players. <br>\n<br>\nTunneling isn't by itself an indication of alignment, but generally when town chooses to tunnel, it's because they're truly convinced that their target is scum, and that tends to be obvious from their posts through aggression or through constantly bringing up new points against the person they think is scum. But Code_X was primarily defending himself from Nikanor and his posts did not really have the aggression typically seen in tunneling cases. Instead, it feels like he decided to stay slightly in the background without showing much of a conscious effort at scumhunting. Even his initial case on Nikanor consisted mainly of points that other people had made. <br>\n<br>\nHe did not comment much on other players, and when he did, the cases he outlined were fairly weak and unsupported. The switch of his vote onto WMPE felt a bit random and out of nowhere, but what I really found strange was that after he re-affirmed that he doesn't find Vijay scummy, he made post #605 where he very strongly implied that Vijay is scum and deserving of a lynch.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: Code_X</div>", "time": "Sun Jun 03, 2012 5:42 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=21920&start=925", "forum": "53", "thread": "21920"}

Though at the same time the whole of day one felt as I've said to Oso was like I was defending myself from Nik and Imp. Yes I found Nik the scummiest yesterday. Yes he found me the scummiest. It kind of side-tracked the rest of the players, because every time I ended up reading the thread it was merely to end up defending myself against Nik and Imp and the same old argument. I was suspicious of Zor/WMPE and Imp and laid that out albeit not in as clear form as Nikanor. Nor did I actively push a lynch against any one bar Nik but that was due to the fact I'd got carried away with thinking he was scum.

Despite the comment mentioned earlier in this post about Post 717 where you say you weren't interested in lynching vijay D1.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\n1. I said that I don't think vijay is town, but I say it is possible he could be trollling town ala epic mafia. I don't consider it conceding anything, cause vijay had admitted to trolling on purpose.<br>\n2. yes zoraster did come out of nowhere to vote vijay, and yest I did put vijay at L-1. The difference is I had been pressuring Vijay most of the game. My vote on Vijay could be supported by numerous posts, zoraster on the other hand could not. I also get off the wagon after I processed that his wagon formed way to fast and I was already suspicious of 2 people on voting vijay.<br>\n<br>\nhe also tries to take my post in number 717 out of context and uses it against me. If you read the thread IN CONTEXT, zoraster was arguing that I was trying to get Vijay the claimed vig lynched. and I was arguing that i did no such thing. I did however try to get vijay the \"not claimed vig\" lynched. This is a blatant attempt to twist words to paint me as scummy. If he was reading the thread and reading what zoraster was arguing, he would have known exactly what I was talking about. Taking something out of context like that is SCUMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMY<br>\n<br>\nthan he votes me saying he sees \"several\" things however reading that post I can't point to 3 let alone 7 (several means 7) reasons to vote me, especially when it definitely seemed like he was arguring earlier in that post that I was town.<br>\n<br>\nthe fact that he suspected BOTH zoraster and myself as scummy and decided to put me at L-2, that reaks of opportunisim.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\npost 842 - he summarizes his case again - <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4080460#p4080460\" class=\"postlink\">http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.ph ... 0#p4080460</a><br>\n<br>\nthe first point is the \"misrep\" argument. He points to where I said I had no interest in lynching vijay despite having voted for him 3 times, he leaves off the part where I was arguing that \"I had no intention of lynching vijay the claimed vig\" and that all of my votes on vijay were before the claim or after.<br>\n<br>\nhis 2nd point - this is completely false. zoraster was arguing that I was trying to lynch the claimed Vig and that i CC'd the vig to get him lynched, but my actions definitely show this wasn't true.<br>\n<br>\nhis 3rd point - first this is a horrible reason to vote someone, 2nd, if he had read the thread he would have known that vijay was accusing me of reacting bad to pressure when nobody was voting me. so using vijay's definition of pressure, I was voting Vijay and Implosion was asking him to explain how I was under pressure (keep in mind that to this day, vijay never answers implosion that I can recall) so that is 2 people who are beginng to suspect vijay some what. That is more pressure than the pressure vijay was accusing me of. So yes vijay was under pressure. and claiming vig to kill me definitely looked like a desperation attempt to get me to back off him. there is no town motivation for claiming vig and threatening to kill the person voting you.<br>\n<br>\nhis 4th point - yes I said it is possible that vijay could be trolling town, but I didn't say it was a very good probability. I said point blank that I thought he was scum. And yes I took my vote off zoraster because it was obvious that i was the only one who thought zoraster was scum. There is no point in keeping my vote on somebody who isn't going to get lynched. The only 2 lynches for day 1 seemed to be nik or vijay.<br>\n<br>\nhis 5th point - yes I zeroed in on zoraster today because it was a new day and there wasn't a deadline to worry about. I was more convinced zoraster was scum than vijay.<br>\n<br>\nhis summary - I haven't been inconsistant in my comments and my votes have supported them. Day 1 on multiple occasions I gave my concrete list of 4 people I thought had a good chance to flip scum, and my votes were on all 4 people during day 1. When you are near deadline you obviously can't start a new wagon especially when everyone seems to think zoraster was town.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nin summary - every single reason he is using to vote me is very weak. his putting me at L-2 today also reaks of opportunisim and he really hasn't \"pushed\" anyone else to vote me. My wagon has fallen apart and he hasn't done a single thing to prevent it.<br>\n<br>\nI would think that a townie who was dead set on someone being scum, would put in more effort to try and get someone lynched. Much like I did with all of the people I voted for. I argued for each and every single person I voted for, I tried to get others to see why they were scummy.<br>\n<br>\nfitz really hasn't done that. he just throws out his weak reasonings and than he lurks some more.<br>\n<br>\nI am not pointing it out right now, but I also see something that looks like role fishing coming from fitz, and it was that one thing that made me decide to go back and re-read fitz.<br>\n<br>\nI am fine with my vote on vijay, but I will also endorse a fitz lynch.", "time": "Tue Jun 05, 2012 8:07 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=21920&start=950", "forum": "53", "thread": "21920"}

Time doesn't necessarily make actions any less scummy. What struck me about your read on Split was that you barely mentioned him in your summary whereas Nikanor was much more emphasized, and you brought up more points on other people than on Split, yet still you called Split nearly as scummy as Nik.

Confused how you can misinterpret it.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nWell, it's not about the fact that you used the term itself but more of the connotation of the term in contrast with the context you used it in. \"Barking up the wrong tree\" is generally used to describe someone who is making a mistake while trying to achieve something. (I just looked it up to double check.) That phrase implies someone is actively trying to achieve something (in this case, getting scum lynched) and that they're making a mistake (trying to lynch you), which has a pretty strong implication that the person in question is town. Of course, this is a nitpicky argument which is why I'm not even close to basing off my case on this.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Code_X wrote:</cite>605 -I don't know why your hung up over.

His latest posts have been incredibly scummy, especially where he plays the VI card. He looks and feels caught scum. But let's say you're on the fence on him, 50/50 say rather than the 90/10 I am.

But you need to actually say so rather than just saying, \"yeah, yeah. he could be scum, but this other guy is MORE probably scum.\" Because the guy has claimed VT now and is of little use even if he IS town, which is pretty darn unlikely. Because as town he reduces the pool of players that town has to shoot at to find a power role, he'll stick around, and then we'll STILL have to make a decision on him at some point in the future. We can't even use \"well, he might be scum because he's still alive\" because of COURSE he'll still be alive. <br>\n<br>\nFrankly, the resistance to vijay's lynch is astounding.

I said that I don't think vijay is town,but I say it is possible he could be trollling town ala epic mafia. I don't consider it conceding anything,cause vijay had admitted to trolling on purpose. 2. yes zoraster did come out of nowhere to vote vijay, and yest I did put vijay at L-1. The difference is I had been pressuring Vijay most of the game. My vote on Vijay could be supported by numerous posts,zoraster on the other hand could not.

I did however try to get vijay the \"not claimed vig\" lynched. This is a blatant attempt to twist words to paint me as scummy.

It was made today and you state you say you &#8220;didn&#8217;t want to lynch vijay&#8221;. You don&#8217;t say &#8220;I didn&#8217;t want to lynch him as long as he was a claimed vig&#8221;. And in regards to his vig claim&#8230;as I pointed out earlier&#8230;.it lasted all of 7 posts. Ie hardly at all. So are you now claiming that you had no desire to lynch vijay between posts 161 (claim) and 168 (unclaim)? Seriously? This despite the fact you &#8220;knew&#8221; he was lying and were willing to potentially garner his lynch with your counterclaim?! And when you unvote him in post 162, to make no reference to the unvote being based on his vig claim and you infer you don&#8217;t believe it by moving your vote to vijay&#8217;s &#8220;scumbuddy&#8221; nik. And then once vijay comes clean in post 168 rather than hop back on him immediately (because you suspected him so much before his claim and thought/knew him to be lying scum after the claim) you waffle on and off the Nik wagon for the next 8 or 9 pages. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">&lt;---- How&#8217;s that for context?</div><br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4096926#p4096926\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4096926#p4096926\" data-post-id=\"4096926\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 968</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=13986\">Robbnva</a> wrote:</cite>than he votes me saying he sees \"several\" things however reading that post I can't point to 3 let alone 7 (several means 7) reasons to vote me,especially when it definitely seemed like he was arguring earlier in that post that I was town. </div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nSeven means 7.

He points to where I said I had no interest in lynching vijay despite having voted for him 3 times,he leaves off the part where I was arguing that \"I had no intention of lynching vijay the claimed vig\" and that all of my votes on vijay were before the claim or after. <div style=\"display:inline;color:blue\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Show me where you say this <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\"> \"I had no intention of lynching vijay the claimed vig\"? And see my point above regarding the effect vijay&#8217;s claim had on you.</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\nhis 2nd point - this is completely false. zoraster was arguing that I was trying to lynch the claimed Vig and that i CC'd the vig to get him lynched,but my actions definitely show this wasn't true. <div style=\"display:inline;color:blue\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Read closer. Iirc my point was that you were using the motivation of vijay&#8217;s claim as a negative towards him while at the same time defending yourself from similar motivation related suspicions. Basically using motivations to implicate vijay and to absolve you.</div></div><br>\n<br>\nhis 3rd point - first this is a horrible reason to vote someone,2nd,if he had read the thread he would have known that vijay was accusing me of reacting bad to pressure when nobody was voting me. so using vijay's definition of pressure,I was voting Vijay and Implosion was asking him to explain how I was under pressure (keep in mind that to this day,vijay never answers implosion that I can recall) so that is 2 people who are beginng to suspect vijay some what. That is more pressure than the pressure vijay was accusing me of. So yes vijay was under pressure. and claiming vig to kill me definitely looked like a desperation attempt to get me to back off him. there is no town motivation for claiming vig and threatening to kill the person voting you. <div style=\"display:inline;color:blue\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">WTF are you talking about? My point stands. You claimed vijay was claiming due to pressure and my point is that he only had one vote at the time he fakeclaimed. It&#8217;s a fact. So a vote and a question caused him to concoct a fakeclaim? I don&#8217;t like vijay&#8217;s playstyle but even for him that seems a huge reeeeeeeeeach.</div></div><br>\n<br>\nhis 4th point - yes I said it is possible that vijay could be trolling town,but I didn't say it was a very good probability. I said point blank that I thought he was scum. And yes I took my vote off zoraster because it was obvious that i was the only one who thought zoraster was scum. There is no point in keeping my vote on somebody who isn't going to get lynched. The only 2 lynches for day 1 seemed to be nik or vijay. <div style=\"display:inline;color:blue\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Did you say vijay could be town and did you say zoraster was 100% and 99% scum? You opted for the possible town over the 99+% scum zoraster.</div></div><br>\n<br>\nhis 5th point - yes I zeroed in on zoraster today because it was a new day and there wasn't a deadline to worry about. I was more convinced zoraster was scum than vijay. <div style=\"display:inline;color:blue\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">I don&#8217;t even know how to respond to this BS. If zoraster is so scummy to you what does the deadline matter? <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":?\" title=\"Confused\"></div></div><br>\n<br>\nhis summary - I haven't been inconsistant in my comments and my votes have supported them. Day 1 on multiple occasions I gave my concrete list of 4 people I thought had a good chance to flip scum,and my votes were on all 4 people during day 1. When you are near deadline you obviously can't start a new wagon especially when everyone seems to think zoraster was town. <div style=\"display:inline;color:blue\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Um&#8230;yes&#8230;you have been inconsistent. You have made 22 changes to your vote in this game covering 7 players (8 if we count you). You are either town that doesn&#8217;t know WTF they are doing or what to think OR you are scum trying to implicate everyone in hopes a townie wagon gets traction.</div></div><br>\n<br>\nin summary - every single reason he is using to vote me is very weak. his putting me at L-2 today also reaks of opportunisim and he really hasn't \"pushed\" anyone else to vote me. My wagon has fallen apart and he hasn't done a single thing to prevent it. <div style=\"display:inline;color:blue\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Uh&#8230;my reasons aren&#8217;t weak. Could you bullet list your suspicions towards me like I did in post 842? My putting you at L-2 had nothing to do with opportunism&#8230;it had to do with suspicion. If you had been at L-1 I would have hammered. I vote people whose lynches I support. You should try it.</div></div><br>\n<br>\nI would think that a townie who was dead set on someone being scum,would put in more effort to try and get someone lynched.

I have basically debunked most of your reasons anyway and showed how you took things out of context. bottom line you are trying to put a square peg into a round hole.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>@Robb&#8230;if you were by some miracle town and I was scum (which I am not) &#8230;why would I pick out anything that would detract from what would be a bogus case on you and seemingly contradict my vote on you?

Whether you were scum OR town there would be no way you could know whether he was telling the truth or not&#8230;unless you were a vig yourself. Which you are not. So if vijay had been telling the truth you could have got the real vig killed. As it turns out he immediately retracted his vig claim and I find his unclaim in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4030706#p4030706\">Post 168</a> to be believable&#8230;as in coming from town.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\n1.

Because if there is a way of confirming Robb's alignment (CODE!?)

Not sure if that is scum laying low or town resigned to their fate but all the same...game avoidance is something I really dislike. zoraster (who was one of the ISOs I was doing) has also been a bit awol so agreed there. This game is really turned into a 3 person (Robb,Code &amp; I) circle debate and I'd like to get out of the roundabout we are stuck in and (if Code's hint hints are valid) find the real scum.<br>\n<br>\nOso and Split are basically confirmed town.

Regardless&#8230;the 2 nd trade is the one I think everyone will enjoy. I&#8217;m also a one-shot cop. I can make one investigation. N1 I investigated Oso and of course he came back clean.<br>\n<br>\nWhy did I investigate Oso. 1) I was leaning town on him and I thought if he did come back clean&#8230;I might consider neighborizing him as well so that I would know my neighbor was legit. 2) he is a very well thought out player and in our last game and this one he comes across as town&#8230;so combined with his hammer&#8230;which I did question IMO a bit,I thought if he DID come back scum it would be on someone I would have never suspected. I thought about investigating Robb but didn&#8217;t because I believed his Vig claim and thought he stood a good chance of dying. I also almost investigated Implosion but after Nik flipped town I was questioning my read on Imp. And in hindsight I&#8217;m glad I didn&#8217;t waste an investigation on the N1 NK.<br>\n<br>\nHere is my breadcrumb below (I removed the hyperlink in Post 717): <blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4080177#p4080177\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4080177#p4080177\" data-post-id=\"4080177\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 821</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=11821\">havingfitz</a> wrote:</cite><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">C</div>atching up from over the weekend...<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">O</div>K,so Robbnva isn't a vig.

Why question/ISO someone you have a town result on?<br>\n<br>\nIn post 849 Code details why he felt zoraster was scummier than Robb on D1 (so why not investigate zoraster last night?)<br>\n<br>\nIn post 856 Code appears to be excusing vijay&#8217;s vig claim. Says he was under pressure (I agree) and that he seems to be that kind of player (I also agree). This seems ironic given all the crap Code has given me the last few pages for &#8220;saving&#8221; vijay.<br>\n<br>\nAnd in post 861 Code starts his claim game following some questioning from Oso.

Scum or town, his play has made just about any read you could get off players voting him almost useless if he is town.

{"number": 1101, "id": "4103423", "user": "triangle123", "user_id": "16805", "content": "In order to avoid yet another obnoxiously long wall post, I have decided to split my post into two. This first one will address some comments Robbnva made towards me, and the second will address everything that has occurred since my last post.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Robbnva wrote:</cite>your last post before yesterday's post was tuesday. that is 48 hours. You manage to annouce a 48 hour v/la earlier in the game but now you go another 48 hours and than you post ONLY about Code and nothing else.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nFirst off, I only made two posts about Code so it's not as if I have been tunneling hard on him and avoiding everything else in the game. In fact, I've made a point of addressing at the very least the major occurrences. My posts are infrequent, yes, as an unfortunate consequence of not having a lot of time to post (I'm a slow post-writer so I read much more often than I post), but I do end up saying everything I wish to say. Most of my posts are long enough and cover enough of a period of time that they could be split into multiple posts scattered throughout that time period at an activity level satisfactory to you, but I sadly do not have the time to post multiple times throughout the day. I do, however, keep up with the game and remain involved in its occurrences.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Robbnva wrote:</cite>but when you actually respond you cut out the 2nd part, especially the part where I ask you who your scum reads are and you never answer that question. Why did you ignore that? in your response you basically just talk in circles making it seem like you don't know who is scum at the moment. It seems quite odd that you would ignore such a direct question AND to actually edit it out when you finally do respond.</div></blockquote> <br>\n<br>\nHmm? I didn't ignore your question. I carried on with my scum-hunting efforts by examining iso's, asked some questions of players, and eventually concluded that Code_X was my top scum read. I didn't edit it out with the intent of misconstruing your post in any way, and I don't feel I actually did misrep you. It simply was not something I was directly addressing because I was already planning to run through some iso's before you asked me about my scumreads and it seemed redundant to post your question when I was already going to inadvertently answer it.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Robbnva wrote:</cite>again I ask you for YOUR thoughts on the Oso hammer. I wanted YOUR opinion.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nGiven that Oso claimed and very reasonably explained his hammer right before my post, I thought my opinion on it would be obvious... But if you meant my thoughts on it at the time it happened, I'd be happy to give it to you now. I didn't find it unreasonable for him to hammer Nikanor given that the day had been dragging and going in circles for quite a bit, and more than one person was becoming fed up with that. He expressed discontentment at how the day was faltering and no wagons came to a lynch, and the hammer was a natural extension of that. <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Robbnva wrote:</cite>And last thing, I still do not get why Code is all of a sudden a scum read for you when he was a town read day 1</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nI already explained this in my original post on him.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Robbnva wrote:</cite>the 2 names that stand out on the wagon would be fitz and vijay, yet you question Code?

{"number": 1108, "id": "4103478", "user": "triangle123", "user_id": "16805", "content": "These are my thoughts mostly in chronological order of what's happened in the game since my last post.<br>\n<br>\nRegarding Robbnva vs. Fitz, I believe both are town (Robbnva more so than Fitz, though) and I disagree with both their arguments on each other. For example, Robbnva wrote:<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Robbnva wrote:</cite>the fact that he suspected BOTH zoraster and myself as scummy and decided to put me at L-2,that reaks of opportunisim.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nThis feels like a bit of a reach to me. L-2 is still a far cry from an actual lynch, and it's not unusual in the least for someone to have a stronger scum read on one person than another, even if they're both scum reads. <br>\n<br>\nI also don't think it was unreasonable for Fitz to question Robbnva about not being killed. I'm not really seeing the WIFOM in that, especially since it's a question that has been raised by more than just Fitz if I remember correctly (and was explained by Robbnva a couple times). <br>\n<br>\nSimilarly, I'm not really seeing the arguments Fitz makes on Robbnva. <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Fitz wrote:</cite>You have made 22 changes to your vote in this game covering 7 players (8 if we count you). You are either town that doesn&#8217;t know WTF they are doing or what to think OR you are scum trying to implicate everyone in hopes a townie wagon gets traction.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nI actually disagree that this is necessarily a scum indication. I think it's mostly a null tell and maybe somewhat of a town-ish tell (though a weak one, I suppose) because scum are generally leery to stand out and catch attention, especially by something like changing votes so rapidly. It could even indicate that it's just somewhat indecisive town changing his mind a lot, and changing your mind generally implies that you're genuinely thinking about what's going on.<br>\n<br>\nOso brings up a good point in 985 regarding Vijay's odd inconsistency on Oso. I don't think he's doing it, as I believe Oso's saying, in order to have both statements available should he ever need something to back up his point, but rather I think it might be an indication that his reads are possibly contrived and he didn't keep them straight while writing the post, which would of course be scummy. As I'll go into later on this post, I need to re-evaluate Vijay.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Code_X wrote:</cite>It felt like you were coaching the VI. Educating people isn't bad nope. But when there's two viable wagons and your telling one - the one you've made clear you don't want lynching - not to self-vote then yeah I think it's bad.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nWait, I still don't quite understand what's so bad about Fitz telling Vijay not to self-hammer. It seemed okay to me.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Unvote: Code_X</div><br>\n<br>\nI had a scum read on him but his claim changes things up. I do believe his claim because he's been hinting at it throughout the game and because it's generally not a good idea for scum to claim cop. The risk is too high that someone could counter-claim when it comes to such a common role, and it's a fairly demanding lie to keep up during the game. <br>\n<br>\nAs I've said, I have a weak town read on Fitz but I don't think his claim makes him anything close to confirmed townie. His claim could be fairly easily faked by scum, especially since the person he investigated and is now clearing is someone who was already confirmed, so it wouldn't be a loss to the scum team if he was scum. Furthermore, I do find it a bit odd that he would breadcrumb the word \"COP\" instead of \"JOAT\". <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Oso wrote:</cite>Whereas Fitz's claim is more complicated and more likely to fall apart if it is fake. I.E we will know if he is a neighborizer if he doesn't end up in the dead list as he has no reason to not neighborize me or Split. He got a clean read on me. There is no reason for him not to neighborize either one of us as his read on me clears split as well.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nWell, there are still scum neighborizers.<br>\n<br>\nHowever, I do agree that we definitely should not be lynching any of the claimed power roles today. With Code_X now a town read for me in light of his claim, I need to re-evaluate my reads once more, particularly my read on Vijay.", "time": "Thu Jun 07, 2012 3:12 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=21920&start=1100", "forum": "53", "thread": "21920"}

(at least in your next post after 1095).  Unless the mod is fcuking with us and there are two varieties of cop...you're lying.  <br>\n<br>\n@town...look at the post where I claim and the notes/comments I provide towards Code...they are quite convincing IMO.<br>\n<br>\n@anyone...if I was scum, why would I counter Code?  First off...vijay was heading towards a lynch whether I claimed or not, so there was no reason for me to save myself another night.  And if I was going to concoct a claim...why not regular cop?  Or why not something different from Code's cop?  Why put myself unnecessarily in a 1v1 situation?  Code is scum.  And the only reason I claimed at all today was because Code placed the softball on the T for me to swing at when he claimed one of my JOAT abilities (ie Cop).  Otherwise I probably would have waited until I'd had a chance to neighborize someone.<br>\n<br>\nLook at his claim.  He was starting to get some attention his way and layed the ground work for his claim shortly after D2 started.  By the time he comes fully out with his claim he was right around 3 votes iirc.  His efforts to link his buddy vijay to me (despite his own defense towards vijay D1).   <br>\n<br>\nI didn't breadcrumb JOAT because it didn't occur to me to do so.  I was looking at the role as  a Cop role and a neighborizor role.  Cop is easy to breadcrumb...neighborizor I didn't breadcrumb because I can prove that by successfully neighborizing someone.  And to scum...I'm not limiting myself to anyone to neighborize so unless you do have a RBer good luck killing my choice.  <br>\n<br>\nI'm fine with lynching vijay today.  And other than losing a townie (me) I'm fine with my potential lynch if you all can't see that he is lying.  Once I flip it would be game over for Code and I've provided my thoughts on the other players.<br>\n<br>\nDecisions decisions fellow town <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\"><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: </span><br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: vijay</span><br>\n<br>\nZzzzzzzzzzz....g'nite.", "time": "Thu Jun 07, 2012 4:18 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=21920&start=1100", "forum": "53", "thread": "21920"}

Scum has their way paved for them if town is lurking and they are left to control the game. However, he has been following my activity, tracked me around the site, and not once called me scum for lurking--he just wants me to be active.

I'm not arguing with the impression that looking at the claims and what we know for sure (fitz's alignment and by association, split's and mine as well based on our claim and fitz's investigation) that there is a good chance one of the claims was false. POE gives us the Cop claim as the false one.<br>\n<br>\nBut, what can be taken to be accurate in general frequently bites you in the ass when using it in the specific. \"Average\" is just that. A median value that tends to disregard the extremes as anomalies. But the anomalies still exist.<br>\n<br>\nNot that I'm going to let that concern try to stop this though. As split indicated and Robb indicated, it is pretty much a win/win. Even if Code_X is town, that leaves me, split, Robb an Nero as near confirmed as you can get without actually dying. So that would leave 3(of 4) confirmed in a 3C-1UC-3S LYLO (assuming 3 scum and 1 of the confirmed NKed).<br>\n<br>\nThe only way this bites us in the ass, from what I can figure, is if the unlimited Cop is here because scum is overpowered by a 4th member and we are in LYLO right now and don't even realize it. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">BUT</div> even I'll admit there is no way in hell to know that and with an unlimited Cop with results, a 1 shot cop with a result and 2 lynches, blind luck says we should have hit at least 1 scum if there was a 4 man scum team. There are two confirmed town lynches (Nik, vijay) and 4 cop innocents (Robb, Nero, myself and split through our shared claim). That is 6 out of 13. If there is 4 (or even the standard 3) scum, there should be at least one scum in there if everyone is on the level.<br>\n<br>\nSo yeah, Code_X is lying.", "time": "Wed Jun 13, 2012 5:27 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=21920&start=1225", "forum": "53", "thread": "21920"}

No matter how I look at it, it looks like she had prior knowledge that Code_X has a result to give. Her pounding the fact that town is 'too powerful' isn't counter-balanced by trying to at least reconcile, in her own mind at least, how both claims might be true. I know this because she says she didn't even think that scum might have an RB in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4119392#p4119392\" class=\"postlink\">Post 1239</a>. Honestly looking at both claims would naturally lead you to think of the roles scum might have to counter all claims if they were true. Tierce isn't doing that other than to pay lip service to others who mention the possibilities.<br>\n<br>\nCode_X is scum. Not because I think he is being bussed but rather because of how I would recommend dealing with a real Cop if I were scum. In no scenario that I can up with, does the cop live or remain unblocked. The only thing that gets a real cop with a useable result after claim is if scum have no RB and the Cop gets protected. But we have a dead JOAT last night so we know that scum didn't even try and target Code_X with an NK and they should have if he was a real cop. With two mislynches already, they can afford a no-kill night if there does happen to be a Doc(or JK) on town's side. Add in that they can tell, based on their power, if what is showing stands a good chance of being the total town power. Then hitting the Cop becomes more attractive if they can reasonably assume all of town's power is showing.<br>\n<br>\nThe whole mess about WIFOMing to get the Cop claim lynched becomes redundant when you can just kill him and be done with it. I can assume that even if they wanted to get the Cop claimed lynched, a block would be almost mandatory. So they don't have an unrestricted RB. If they don't have an RB AND all claims so far are true, then if you go ahead and take general balance into account, town doesn't have a Doc/JK. If town doesn't have a Doc/JK (and like I said earlier, scum would have a pretty good idea if all town power were showing if all claims are true) the claimed cop doesn't live.

The fact that you are aware that scum don't typically protect each other to that extent means that you can make arguments such as this that gives you a free pass to do so. You've made most of these arguments against Triangle before, and she's answered your questions rather well, so I'm not going to sit here and repeat them. She can do so if she wants to. But I'll rebuttal those points you made about yourself:<br>\n<br>\n1. Would scum stall a mislynch? Sure. It's not hard to do, there aren't many immediate repercussions, and it serves to make you look pro-town later. It's completely null.<br>\n2. To be honest, when I first read Vijay's vig claim, I took it as a joke, and I wasn't expecting the amount of response it gathered. So calling BS on that claim does little to convince me of your alignment. You could make an argument towards you counterclaiming vig, but that option seems so out there for both town and scum.<br>\n3. You're really asking me why scum would keep both PRs alive when one of them was scum? The wagon would have probably headed toward Code, so yeah, it would be to scum's benefit to keep both of them alive.<br>\n4. \"Oh hey, let me point out something that will get people behind the lynch but I won't place a vote so I won't suffer the consequences.\" By your attitude, you seem to be aware of the many tricks and theory of mafia, so why do you want me to explain these actions? <br>\n5. Would scum typically confirm a buddy? Please. Everyone is so lost in the WIFOM of this that it hardly is ever really taken into consideration, and it gives scum something to hide behind. <br>\n<br>\nAs far as trying to confirm yourself not being scummy, sure.

I recall a game in which Thor665 was scum and he opened the day with a self-vote. Not a self-hammer, a self-vote. It's a stalling and distraction tactic. It's meant to throw town in for a loop, to make them doubt themselves.

We don't win this game by lynching town! If you say you're being a distraction, then shut up and listen to others for a while instead of pushing for your own lynch. If you are town, that is absolutely ridiculous.

And that was more of a long the lines of catching him in a lie. He claimed he had never seen town cc a vig claim and I knew that was a lie. I did ask Tierce why she would take the time to meta someone she thought was town but not meta someone she thought was scum, especially when she claimed that was her best attribute (doesn't anyone else wonder that? if she claims she is AWESOME at meta'ing people, why she would not do that to help make her case against me? she down right said she would not meta me.

The only people who can have that kind of certainty is scum.  Me thinking scum would not clear their partner is a personal belief and I never said that he is 100% clear.

He's certainly playing that part as town.<br>\n<br>\nWhat I don't understand is how quickly Robbnva was willing to vote Nero and how quickly he jumped off because I 'swooped in'. This makes no sense, as I had been expressing beliefs that Nero was scum for quite a while. It just looked like--again--he was hungry for pulling stuff out of context and grab at the little things to blow them up without looking at the bigger picture. This is not a protown mindset, and most of Robbnva's votes feel like this. Look at his voting history today, for example--he jumps on YYR, triangle, me and Nero in quick sequence, and no matter what he claims, his votes are not well reasoned. Nero has now claimed that Robbnva \"convinced him\" that I was scum. I call bullshit on that.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\ntriangle is town because her play matched and still matches her town meta. She doesn't have mush of a surviving scum meta, but she has been consistent in her train of thought, inquisitive and analytical. I played with triangle before, and there was a LOT of silly wagoning on her. She was town.<br>\n<br>\nYYR is also matching his town play, and being town in general. I didn't get much of a read on his predecessor, but he is scrutinizing everything, including his townreads. No, Roobnva. It's not like I never put these two reads in question--it's that when I go back and analyze them to make sure they are still town in my mind, they all check out.<br>\n<br>\nzoraster is the one wild card here. my read on him is mostly dependent on the havingfitz kill. This is still a completely bollocks kill for any sane scum to make, and zoraster knows this. He wouldn't make that grievous an error and then hope that someone would go \"oh this would be too stupid for zoraster he's obvtown\". It would be too risky because no one might catch that--so the possibility that remains is that zorotter is not stupid and did not kill havingfitz. i.e. I don't think he was bussing Code_X.<br>\n<br>\nAnd back on the level of intelligence, yes, I'm playing this card, and yes, I think triangle and YYR are far too smart to kill havingfitz and doom their partner Code_X to an immediate noose.<br>\n<br>\nThat leaves the other two.<br>\n<br>\nRobbnva has been attempting to look protown all over the place.

The one thing that makes me doubt this is the fact that you never pushed me as scum while I was on vacation, but the other side of the coin says it was because you already had comfortable pushes to make elsewhere. Now that those are gone, Robbnva is accusing me of being scum lurking on this game while I was on vacation. Here's a hint: I don't like this game. I don't like you. This is in no way CFJ's fault, but a good part of it is yours. You're abrasive, obnoxious, pushy and if you are town, you are utterly suffocating everyone else in games grab my interest more because they are <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">fun</div>? That's where my time and posts are going.<br>\nThat said: yes, Robbnva takes things out of context, blows them up, defines them as scummy, and completely ignores all logical evidence of the contrary even when it is repeated time and time again. Arguing with him is impossible, because he doesn't look at the facts beyond his nose. If he's town, he is tunneling like crazy and he is right--we don't want a person like this at LyLo.

My main reasons for finding him scum before were that he has been a lackluster participant in the game and that he'd blatantly sheeped Robbnva with his earlier vote on Tierce, but his previous lack of effort is actually a null tell. What's to say he's lazy scum instead of lazy town? Furthermore, he changed from voting Tierce to voting me, which surprised me because if you're scum and in a day approaching deadline quickly, chances are that you'll want to be rushing a lynch. So if you're rushing a lynch, you'd most likely try to go after someone who's already racked up some votes or is already showing potential as a lynch candidate - you don't try to go after someone who no one else has expressed interest in lynching. Nero's case on me, then, was a genuine effort at scumhunting.<br>\n<br>\nAs for my vote on Tierce, I think it's fairly clear that Tierce and Robbnva are of opposing alignments, so lynching one gives information as to the other. If Robbnva is scum, the team is likely to be Robbnva and Nero. If Tierce is scum, it's likely to be Tierce and YYR. When I was thinking about this, my first instinct was to vote for Robbnva, but I decided to do a re-read of both their ISOs before making a hasty decision.<br>\n<br>\nI've had a steady town read on Robbnva for much of the early part of the game, and my read on him only started flip-flopping when I was thinking from the perspective of Nero as scum. But now that I'm realizing Nero is more likely to be town, I don't really see Robbnva as that scummy. I've always had a pretty fixed idea of Tierce as town, but certain aspects of her play stuck out to me when I was re-reading her ISO, and I may have been too close-minded to notice them before. Her sudden switch onto Vijay was one of these. I know she did explain this in one of her posts, but something about it strikes me as contrived. <br>\n<br>\nI also feel like I may have been wrong in discounting the idea of the Code_X wagon being a bus because something Tierce said is standing out to me: her repeated arguments about how bad the havingfitz kill was. This argument is, of course, particularly WIFOM-y, but the way she repeated it two or three times is somewhat odd. I think it's quite possible that she purposely did a bad kill, sacrificing an already scummy member of her scum team, in order to make herself look townier, and this idea is supported by the fact that she's stated that she's seen an experienced player do the same tactic effectively. <br>\n<br>\nI've been thinking about this for a while and keep second-guessing myself, but for now, this is where I want my vote.", "time": "Sat Jun 30, 2012 10:28 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=21920&start=1575", "forum": "53", "thread": "21920"}

Whatever your alignment, you are not going to admit you are scum. So the best choice, for me-town, is to ensure that one of my scumreads or myself is lynched today, because that clears my intentions. Furthermore, everyone but you already knows why I am voting you, and I have no intention of making a pretty case to appease you and for you to deconstruct. I am not going to start a post going \"here is my case on Robbnva\". I don't have to do that as town. I don't have to help you wiggle out by, once again, misrepresenting everything I say. Therefore, I want a lynch among the people central to this conflict. If it is on you or Nero, it's most likely a scumlynch. (Yay!) If it is on me, it clears my slot. My attitude toward lynching my slot is COMPLETELY different from YOUR attitude and your hoppity hop self-vote, btw. It's clear as night and day, but I have no interest in discussing the whys and hows during the game, it's just more white noise. (Hint: it's because Robbnva is scum.)<br>\n<br>\nYou are doing what Fatescum did in Open 390 when I resigned myself, as town, to be lynched. I stopped fighting it, and scum doesn't know how to react toward a resigned townie, much like scum doesn't know how to post in twilight. You are criticizing my playstyle and putting the blame for a town loss on me. Tomorrow, I can see you going \"boo hiss, she was town, but it was her fault\". That crap doesn't fly, because you have taken part on getting me lynched and are trying to shirk away from all that responsibility one day from deadline. A town loss is on the shoulders of the whole town, and you're trying to use me as a scapegoat. Town doesn't act like that during the game.<br>\n<br>\nGood night and good luck.

No. Of course you realize all this. Thus a 15 minute switch. <br>\n<br>\nIt's like you think you can coin your own townie currency by self-voting repeatedly.

It would also nicely setup Robb for a mislynch today given how much I wanted him dead yesterday. The only thing that makes me pause about this is his general lack of activity yesterday which gives me some doubt as to whether he was even around to push something like that (I know Team Mafia ended recently so there's that).

Mentions Triangle in an offhand way to someone else (<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4128717#p4128717\" class=\"postlink\">1302</a>). At some point there, Triangle becomes the &#8220;only firm town read&#8221; YYR has. (<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4153953#p4153953\" class=\"postlink\">1592</a>).

Triangle says that the scum team is likely Tierce and YYR if it&#8217;s Tiercescum (<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4156808#p4156808\" class=\"postlink\">1594</a>) in the same post with a Tierce vote. Then backs away from that the next post. Next interaction was today.<br>\nThis worries me a little bit as Triangle and YYR have virtually no interaction with each other directly. Then again, I don&#8217;t really recall interacting with Triangle myself. Mostly I just think if YYR and Triangle were buddies, they probably would do more to at least seem like they were interacting. As it is, they kind of just leave each other alone. My gut says no to this pairing. <br>\n</li><li><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">YYR-Tierce</div><br>\nYYR starts off with a pretty manufactured interaction with Tierce (<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4107211#p4107211\" class=\"postlink\">1186</a> etc.) with some questions back and forth. Then a very &#8220;buddy buddy&#8221; kind of thing with YYR saying &#8220;Tierce stealin&#8217; my hammer&#8221; (<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4109056#p4109056\" class=\"postlink\">1211</a>). Then he comes out with a little stronger against Tierce saying &#8220;what&#8217;s the town motivation for this?&#8221; to Tierce asking about the neighborizer power (<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4120472#p4120472\" class=\"postlink\">1268</a>). YYR is later &#8220;worried by Tierce&#8221; but then the next time he mentions Tierce he says &#8220;[Tierce] has done a good job explaining things&#8221; (<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4134693#p4134693\" class=\"postlink\">1337</a>. More buddy buddy activity from YYR in Post <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4140369#p4140369\" class=\"postlink\">1440</a> (&#8220;Abort Tierce! Abort!&#8221;)<br>\n<br>\nThen things get interesting. He says that a Tierce lynch is better than a Nero lynch (as mentioned in the Nero section), but has Robbnva ahead of Tierce in scumminess (<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4156356#p4156356\" class=\"postlink\">1592</a>). But then he starts setting up a IF&#8230; THEN&#8230; scenario with Robb and Tierce. I.e. &#8220;If Robb is scum, Tierce isn&#8217;t.&#8221; <br>\nTierce&#8217;s mentions of YYR are somewhat similar. For example, <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4121384#p4121384\" class=\"postlink\">Post 1269</a> is sort of a buddying up type of thing where she comments on something he said, but doesn&#8217;t really bring any heat. The next YYR mention is one where she calls YYR town along with Triangle (<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4132818#p4132818\" class=\"postlink\">1308</a>). The next is basically a place where she skirmishes with Robbnva about whether YYR and Triangle are town (since Robbnva was of the firm belief that the setup was 12 scum and 1 town). Then she defends Robb&#8217;s claim that YYR and triangle were lurking. More &#8220;YYR is town&#8221; <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4145386#p4145386\" class=\"postlink\">here</a>. Then Tierce makes a pretty broad meta based post about YYR (<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4147723#p4147723\" class=\"postlink\">1514</a>). <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n </li><li><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Nero-Triangle</div><br>\nNero makes a comment about triangle being the last scum with conftown split. Then Nero asks YYR why YYR never said Triangle was town before. As of this point, he hasn&#8217;t addressed anything to Triangle all game. In fact other than a list that&#8230; I don&#8217;t even know what it was supposed to mean (<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4157950#p4157950\" class=\"postlink\">1642</a>) Nero doesn&#8217;t even try to address Triangle except as a way to attack YYR. <br>\nFirst time Triangle brings up Nero is to vote him because of &#8220;Process of Elimination.&#8221; (<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4133128#p4133128\" class=\"postlink\">1331</a>) and a really tiny ISO.  At this point, Triangle says that Nero is the only one he&#8217;s comfortable lynching. Says that Nero&#8217;s town claim may not actually make him town. At this point, Triangle goes pretty hard after Nero. Then triangle rethinks his stance on Nero, and thinks Nero is town (<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4156808#p4156808\" class=\"postlink\">1594</a>). After this point, Nero doesn&#8217;t really come up. <br>\n<br>\n</li><li><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Nero-Tierce</div><br>\nTierce starts off having only content by quoting Nero when he was quoted himself. While voting Robbnva, she believes the final scum is within me and Nero and &#8220;would find it hilarious if Code cleared both his teammates&#8221; (<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4132818#p4132818\" class=\"postlink\">1308</a>). She goes for snark when she asks Robbnva about his &#8220;scumbuddy Nero&#8221; (1311). But then she says she doesn&#8217;t want to lynch Nero today, she wants to lynch Robbnva (<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4132996#p4132996\" class=\"postlink\">1322</a>). Then she moves to put Nero at L-1 (1341). She asks Nero to claim at 1357, he does so, then she immediately moves her vote to Robbnva at 1363. Next she agrees with Triangle that his towntell (where he includes splitfarvle in the possible scum) is &#8220;nagging her.&#8221; (<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4132996#p4132996\" class=\"postlink\">1402</a>). Says that she thinks Nero towntold, but then says she thinks  Nero is possible scum because only bad players would go along with killing fitz (<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4140095#p4140095\" class=\"postlink\">1425</a>). Once again says she believes Nero is scum and unvotes Robbnva and votes Nero (<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4145386#p4145386\" class=\"postlink\">1483</a>). Tierce votes Robbnva then switches to Nero again because she thinks robbnva is &#8220;protecting a power role&#8221; (1558). Much of the rest is really the same, and she advances the idea that the lynch should be either Nero or Robbnva. Votes Nero again quickly and then unvotes at lylo. All in all she mentions Nero 91 times throughout the game. <br>\nNero, on the other hand&#8230;  doesn&#8217;t mention Tierce until <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4141114#p4141114\" class=\"postlink\">1444</a>, where he votes her without comment. That&#8217;s his next post after saying that the scum team is between YYR, triangle, split and me (<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4136960#p4136960\" class=\"postlink\">1361</a> He claims at her vote to put him at L-1. In justifying that when asked by triangle, he says &#8220;Robb convinced me.&#8221; Finally comments on something Tierce said (<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4157950#p4157950\" class=\"postlink\">1642</a>). Then guarantees Tierce is scum (<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4173313#p4173313\" class=\"postlink\">1702</a>). </li></ul><br>\n<br>\nHaven't done Triangle-Tierce yet, but I'm running out of time before work, and I think I should post this and come back to T&amp;T.<br>\n<br>\nThese are the pairings that seem most likely to me in order:<br>\n1. YYR-Nero: This is my biggest pairing read. These two barely mention each other at first (besides YYR saying he just doesn't have much n Nero), but more importantly, when both mention the other it's usually to put them in the \"He's Scummy but Less Scummy than Other People\" category. This looks to be a pretty classic distancing attempt. They don't want each other to be <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">lynched</div> but they also want to be seen as being in conflict with each other. Which... they never really are. <br>\n2. YYR-Tierce: YYR-Tierce makes sense to me, but it worries me some that YYR has recently been riding the Tierce lynch pretty hard. In 5p lylo, I&#8217;d really expect scum to go for the win here. Yesterday would have been the more obvious bus day. It&#8217;s complicated by the fact that Tierce and Robb were in a virtual 1v1 situation and a bus might be &#8220;called for&#8221; here (in the same way CodeX was an obvious lynch), but I don&#8217;t think Tierce is anywhere near that level of obvlynch.<br>\n3. Nero-Tierce: Before I started this, this was my best guess for a scum pairing. It isn't now, but it remains plausible. It would require Tierce to have heavily distanced from Nero, frequently putting him at L-1 (though always professing a preference for Robb) and then going after him today, although I don't know if she was seriously thinking she'd get the Nero lynch at that point or was just making a point.<br>\n4. Nero-Triangle: I remain fairly convinced of Triangle-town, but of the two triangle pairings I've looked at so far, this one is the more compelling. But even so, the reversal of his opinion on Nero, though perhaps well timed to get a Robb or Tierce lynch, doesn't seem like something Triangle would do as scum. <br>\n5. YYR-Triangle: Using my WIFOMy reasoning I gave above, I don't think this pairing makes sense as neither has tried in the slightest to distance themselves from each other. The only time that it was plausible was when Triangle said that if Tiercescum then YYRscum, but then backs away from it... if you're distancing, why not leave that intact? <br>\n<br>\nStill need time to digest this (as well as, for the sake of completeness, do Triangle-Tierce... maybe it turns up something surprising), but this was actually kind of helpful for me to add some structure. Hopefully it's helpful to others. <br>\n<br>\nBiggest takeaway now: It makes me very wary of a Tierce lynch today.", "time": "Tue Jul 10, 2012 2:25 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=21920&start=1700", "forum": "53", "thread": "21920"}

More later, but in the meantime, have a somewhat disorganized wall of thoughts and comments:<br>\n<br>\ntriangle's surety that Robbnva and I are of opposite alignments is absurd if she's town at this stage of the game.

She's 'very sure' of a Tierce-zoraster pairing, but how did this come to be other than the fact that Robbnva and I tunneled on each other for most of yesterday? Robbnva was incredibly wrong about some things, and now she's picking up his standard and flying it--why? It seems like she was seeing two very viable mislynches when she shifted her vote to me during yesterday; Robbnva was more likely to implode in LyLo than I am, and so he'd make an easier lynch after I flipped town.<br>\n<br>\nMore to the point, she is saying that scum wouldn't show interest in bussing their partner in LyLo for extra towncred. I know an YYR-Tierce or Nero-Tierce pairing doesn't make sense to me, but discarding them because \"you're showing interest in voting Tierce\" isn't rational in LyLo; lynching correctly today gives us another day, but any scumbag who bussed today would be seen as pretty townish tomorrow and have better chances at a win.<br>\n<br>\nimplosion's death on N1 also implicates triangle. implosion looked quite town, yes, but he had also played with triangle-scum before and was more wary of this in this game, even though he had a townread on her.

{"number": 1806, "id": "4206486", "user": "zoraster", "user_id": "9397", "content": "So... I made the post below sort of free flowing analysis. I apologize that it's not that well structured.<br>\n<br>\nThe crash makes your meta kind of hard to read. The defense based on you not 1v1ing is weak. If that really is your meta, I fully anticipate your next scum game to be certain with your reads and go after someone aggressively. <br>\n<br>\nStill, I don't need to rely on Robbnva to determine your alignment. I can look at the pair of scum flips and ask myself: \"Do I believe Tierce would want to bus not just one but BOTH of her scum mates?\" <br>\n<br>\nSo although Nero-Tierce is the easiest to get a grip on, I think it's time to return to the Code lynch. And to really understand that lynch, the night kill is essential. Tierce has repeatedly called the kill on havingfitz stupid. I tend to agree. So what would they payoff be for scum-Tierce? Because it's basically impossible that she wouldn't have considered that it's a pretty dumb move to kill a used up 1-shot cop that'll inevitably lead to your scummate being lynched. <br>\n<br>\nI think the payoff would be exceedingly low. The only thing that could possibly come from it is a half-chance that people would recognize it as being beneath her. In other words, she didn't do it because she wouldn't do it. But that's a pretty remote possibility, and it's one that I think the majority of players here would be unlikely to make on her behalf.<br>\n<br>\nConclusion: Code-Tierce is unlikely.<br>\n<br>\nLet's turn to Nero. I've already gone through the connections between the two, etc. When I've been thinking about this game, I've suffered moments of panic because the distancing came so much from Tierce, so little from Nero. He doesn't mention her until post 1444. In a way, this is exactly what I'd expect from a good play-bad player scum team trying to distance. But this is all unhelpful. So I want to turn to the Nero lynch and the events that led up to it.<br>\n<br>\nTierce votes Triangle. Nero moves in to vote Triangle. What's he hoping will happen here? There seem to be three main options. One:  he hopes a townie comes in to hammer triangle. Two: he hopes his scum buddy is on and hammers it home. Three: it's an elaborate bus. One seems unlikely because only an idiot is going to hammer with virtually no explanation. Maybe Nero really believed it'd come, but I dont' think so. Three might be believable if Nero were a savvier player, but then again if he were, I have to 100% believe that he would go for the win in 5p lylo. I would. So two seems the more likely explanation, and that would eliminate Tierce as his buddy. To put it another way: I'd expect that pattern of voting on a townie to be Scum-Town-Scum or Town-Scum-Scum, with a preference for the latter. Scum-Scum-Town should be an obviously weak attack for scum to make.<br>\n<br>\nThe (only) nice thing about 3p lylo is that it's zero-sum. If I don't think Tierce is scum, that makes YYR scum.<br>\nAs YYR was basically absent between Nero&#8217;s vote and my hammer, there&#8217;s not much to read there. The same is actually true of the CodeX lynch, now that I look at it. YYR comes in after the hammer is thrown (by CodeX himself) and says &#8220;Damn my schedule. Was that really the hammer?&#8221; I guess it&#8217;d make me feel a little better if YYR had also hopped on the CodeX wagon as even the least connected person would know that CodeX was going to get lynched the following day after a havingfitz kill. <br>\nBecause there&#8217;s not much there to read and compare to Tierce&#8217;s actions, I&#8217;ll rely on my previous connection analysis: <br>\n&#8226;\t<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div> <br>\nYYR-Nero<br>\nYYR at one point says that he \"doesn't have much\" on Nero, but he's got vague towntells (1284), he then says that Nero is likely town due to Code's Result. Then he switches to saying that Nero is a \"utility lynch\" (1486) and finally he's \"down for a Nero lynch\" (1519) without much in the way to describe why he's changing. He puts Nero smack dab in the middle of his scum to town list (1592), then says that Tierce is a better lynch than Nero. (1601)<br>\n<br>\nThe first time Nero brings up YYR is to put him in a potential scum group of 4 (1361) that included the conftown scum mason. <br>\n<br>\nThe next time he really brings up YYR is to say he (Nero) is \"really think' YYR is scum\" (1575, then he pushes a triangle/YYR/code scum team (1577). Then Tierce becomes Nero's first choice, YYR second (1685)<br>\n[...]<br>\nYYR-Nero: This is my biggest pairing read. These two barely mention each other at first (besides YYR saying he just doesn't have much n Nero), but more importantly, when both mention the other it's usually to put them in the \"He's Scummy but Less Scummy than Other People\" category. This looks to be a pretty classic distancing attempt. They don't want each other to be lynched but they also want to be seen as being in conflict with each other. Which... they never really are.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nWith that in mind, although my panic-meter registers very high that I&#8217;m handing Tierce the win, this is it. If you&#8217;re scum, Tierce, at least don&#8217;t make me wait long to find out. <br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: YYR</span>", "time": "Mon Jul 23, 2012 5:33 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=21920&start=1800", "forum": "53", "thread": "21920"}

Sorry. :/<br>\n<br>\nBut really, I don't feel too motivated to post. Here's a scrambled version of a more well thought out post I had planned to make:<br>\n<br>\nAll of the dead scum have had very little interaction with Zor. Yet all of them seem to have him  whenever they list off suspects. It's a bunch of weak distances, all of which is rather unexplained. The push on Robb Day 2 was all sorts of wrong. It's a completely fabricated case based on how he believes that Robb would theoretically act in the whole fake-vig dilemma. It's forced. There's also some slight defense of Code, although that's after reversing from townFitz and scumCode to scum Fitz and townCode.<br>\n<br>\nNight kill on Fitz. The only way I can really look at that kill and the Day that proceeded it is that it was all made to prevent any kind of information. Killing Fitz meant no neighborizing power that could potentially out them or make another townie look better. It secures a Code lynch that was completely likely to happen due to overwhelming support the previous Day, thus allowing a bus for towncred and allows a quicklynch (which Zor was all in favor of). Their other choice was kill mason, likely lynch Code, and then kill Fitz. Same deaths, but the second option would mean more discussion for the town.<br>\n<br>\nI don't particularly remember much of Zor Day 4. Feels like sidelining the Tierce/Robb fight. Defends Nero when he gets to L-1. <br>\n<br>\nWhatever Nero was doing Day 5, I don't think he's stupid. Lazy absolutely. He was obviously setting up a quickhammer, and do you really think he would try to set it up with me at that time? The guy who's already said that he works throughout much of the day. You don't think I would have discussed with Nero a possible time to coordinate a quickhammer that wouldn't take me 12 hours to respond to? While ill-advised for sure, Zor wants to dismiss that because it points to him. He could have responded to a quickhammer a heck of a lot sooner than I could have.<br>\n<br>\nAnd Day 6 obviously wasn't set up against me. I sure wasted my time waiting for all three days for a Day where I had no chance to get anyone else lynched just so we could no lynch and have most of my remaining weekend gone, therefore not allowing me to post much again during this week when we're at 3 player LyLo. And it gets better because Zor tried to push a lynch for me yesterday, or at least throw completely baseless suspicion on me. <br>\n<br>\nBleh.
