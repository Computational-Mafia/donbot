Less and less of the townsfolk dare visit the fair now that so many strange, unexplained accidents have been happening. It is starting to become clear that these deaths are not accidental, but have been carefully plotted by murderous fiends. A group of you have banded together and vowed to root out the killers and bring them to justice, but you are very short on time. The carnival leaves town in only a few days. If you do not find them before then, the carnival will move on and, if carnies are involved, they will surely wreak havoc on the next unsuspecting town.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">ALIVE</div></div><br>\n1. <div style=\"display:inline-flex;text-decoration:line-through\">Swankidelic</div> Pine<br>\n8.

Depending on the circumstance, you may be able to paraphrase things I have sent you (such as a role PM). Use common sense and if you are unsure feel free to ask me via PM. This includes timestamps of role pm's. You may share the quotation in your role pm, if there is one, however. This doesn't have to be paraphrased.<br>\n4) Be courteous to your fellow player. This is just a game - please don't bring personal grudges into the game. Try and keep it civil.<br>\n4a) No Sig/Avatar bets, I can't have someone having an awful avatar as a result of my game.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">&gt; Voting, Lynching &amp; Death<br>\n</div>5) For your vote to be counted, it must be bold, and in the form Vote: Hoopla. Caps and colons are optional, but it <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">must</div> be bolded.<br>\n6) Unvotes aren't necessary, but will be appreciated.<br>\n7) A lynch will occur when a player achieves 50% +1 of the votes. When this has happened, any subsequent votes and unvotes will not be counted, and the game will enter twilight. Night will begin as soon as I have declared the lynch.<br>\n8) You may vote for a &#8216;no lynch&#8217; if desired. If a majority of the players in the game vote for a no lynch, the game will progress to night without a lynch.<br>\n9) Once you're dead, you are dead. Do not post in the thread until the game is over, not even a 'bah' post. There'll be a graveyard to complain in.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">&gt; Activity &amp; Deadlines<br>\n</div>10) This is a speed game and may therefore require you to be more active than in other games. Each player is required to post at least once every 24 hours. Treat this game as a commitment, and try your best to stay active.<br>\n11) Prods will be issued after 24 hours in a row without posting. If I keep having to prod you I'll get angry and replace you. Players may request a prod on another player, as well. I'm human and may forget, so if you want someone prodded just tell me.<br>\n11a) If you do not open a prod or post in the thread within 24 hours of the prod being sent I will begin looking for a replacement.<br>\n12) Things come up in life, if you need time off for something, please let myself and the players know in-thread for V/LA purposes. I will be flexible, but if you can't be here for a significant amount of time I will replace you.<br>\n13) Deadlines for each game day will be 72 hours unless specified as otherwise.<br>\n14) In the event of a deadline ending without a player gaining a majority of votes, there will be a no lynch.<br>\n15) Nights will have a 24 hour deadline. If you fail to send in a night choice, I will automatically default to 'no choice' for that night, and you will do nothing.<br>\n16) Deadlines will only be extended if I need a number of replacements, or barring some other freak circumstances. Apart from that laziness, or anything else, will not result in a deadline extension.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">&gt; Other Information<br>\n</div>pre-17) No mechanism or website may be used to prove that a decision was achieved randomly. I.e. you may chose who claims first by rolling a dice, but you'll have to trust the person who rolled the dice not to lie.<br>\n17) Bold text is reserved for mod communication. Do not bold anything but your votes and communication you need me to see. You may use any colors as long as they are easily read by your other players/myself.<br>\n18) I will try to post Vote Counts as often as possible. Hopefully on the top of every page. If you feel a vote count is needed, don&#8217;t hesitate to ask for one, and I&#8217;ll provide one at the next opportunity.<br>\n19) It's more than possible I've missed a rule or haven't completely covered something. Don't try to exploit it, or I will punish you. If something is fuzzy for you, please ask!<br>\n20) I reserve the right to add more, or modify existing rules at any time. If this happens, I will let everyone know in thread.<br>\n21) Flavor in night/day write ups is just that; flavor. <br>\n22) Have fun!<br>\n<br>\nSAMPLE VANILLA PM:<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>You are a vanilla townie.<br>\n<br>\nAbilities: None.

I've contributed more than others in this game so lynching me for that reason just isn't very valid, its stupid. <br>\n<br>\nAlso although my posts may not have been aggressively looking for scum that's because at that time it was pre-game and there wasn't much to go off expect from the whole SensFan Mason claim and lying, which was a stupid move that wasted everyones time and I did contribute on that, maybe if that never happened we could if focus more on other people, but at the time if you just looked past the Mason claim etc that would be stupid.<br>\n<br>\nI didn't stay below the radar compared to other players.

In There Will Be Bloodshed, IceyCupcake was a Town Neighborizer. They recruited Calcifer (a VT), then TwoHeadedBoy (Godfather), then me (Goon), at which point THB and I took over and manipulated from within, killing off Calcifer before they got suspicious.

Her parents had run the Snack Shack, serving up high-priced candied apples, snowcones and fresh-squeezed lemonade. She loved dipping the apples and rolling them in nuts and was thrilled the day her mother told her she was old enough to run the cotton candy machine. She was 15 now and ever since her birthday, she had been allowed to explore the carnival after hours. Lately, however, things were different. Everyone was trying to find whoever was behind the recent murders, and she had been strictly forbidden to wander alone, especially at dark. She was an obedient child, for the most part, and so it wasn't until sunrise that she found the body. An older gentleman, dressed as a maintenance worker, was lying right behind the Snack Shack. His head was haloed by a pool of blood, which had seeped out of the slit in his neck. A scream caught in Lola's throat, and she slowly stepped backward and then ran to find her parents.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">YankCane151, <div style=\"display:inline;color:#3333FF\">vanilla townie</div>, throat slit Night 1</div><br>\n<br>\n<br>\nLola's attention was wrenched away from the dead man by someone rushing past her.

The first is a little background on me so that you can understand me and my playstyle a little bit more.<br>\n<br>\nBackground on me(because it could prove useful in understanding how to read me): I had 1 year of EM experience and like 2 games of Forum Mafia experience. I am very used to the fast-paced reaction based style of play and it has been strange adjusting to Forum Mafia, however I feel like I am making a pretty strong shift from the former to the latter. <br>\n<br>\nI am not a fan of meta although I know that it is used by people a lot and may even catch scum. But any decent player won't give you a link to a game that will incriminate them, that's just silly. Regardless I won't insult your use of it I will even accept it and even use it myself, I just dislike dependence on it and I dislike it in general.<br>\n<br>\nTwistedSpoons in our last game together (got mod kiled by the way, I have read the site rules though, so that shouldn't be a problem this game. I've never broken the rules in a way in which I had no idea I was breaking the rules before) I posted a ton and gave in depth reads on everyone. This game will be different as it is a speed game. My reason for saying this is that it is a segway into the fact that my way of playing is different than yours most likely. I take a ton of notes and analyze everything to the letter. If you think I'm posting fluff chances are it just looks like fluff and I actually have a goal in mind. Also I noticed that my post in limbo (meant to be at the end of day 1 but I slightly missed it) I forgot to say &gt;implying I live, although i doubt scum will kill me n1 due to the fact that I just entered the game and it'd be a huge dick move especially when there are viable options that aren't me. Anyways the reason for saying this is because I will inform you now that I often will say \"&gt;implying situation A is not the case\" which simply is telling you the implications I am making my post under. I do that to make it more understandable what I'm saying and it does not always reflect my opinion on the situation at hand.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nMy next post shall be my scumcase on that guy.

He first does not even acknowledge the claim at all, going on about beck and his excuse for why he has presented no case on Beck (I do not like this in the slightest, I feel like if he really were as confident a town as he claim he would make the case. Scum often skip this step because they already know who scum is and it feels like a waste of time). Then, <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3228302#p3228302\" class=\"postlink\">he implies he believes the claim</a> and that there is no reason not to trust it. Then his next post says that he <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3228328#p3228328\" class=\"postlink\">doesn't</a> believe the cop claim. He says that only someone as competent as he could see through the /obvious/ fakeclaim. I feel that the only reason it would be so obvious to him would be if he were scum and knew that the report on him were fake (&gt;implying not GF/SK, as far as those roles go, I doubt that they are SensFan). Then he says that he was trying to quickhammer blinker before anyone could out Ran as fake. However this contradicts with the fact that he say it was /obvious/ that Ran was fakeclaiming and that if he were his scum partner he would have bussed his ass all day.  Not only that but it wasn't even obvious, no one had come to the clearcut conclusion that it was a fakeclaim, and the person who the inno is on is the only person who could know that (&gt;implying mafia &gt;not including cop). His bus theory is because we are running around \"lynching all liars\" but that is not true as obviously shown. There is no wagon on Toast, and there is no wagon on SensFan (the two liars), that is why the claim was so weird, SensFan had little if any pressure when he claimed so there was no reason to fakeclear him. Toast only had pressure from Beck, and SensFan highly disregards Becks' opinion so it makes no sense why he would bus someone using the concepts that someone whom he thinks so lowly of uses. <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3228412#p3228412\" class=\"postlink\">This</a>post is scummy because SensFan says \"connect the dots\" which would lead to Ran being shown as scum. However SensFan, in what world would town finding this out the next day be better for Ran OR you than if we got it out in the open now? If the claim was as blatantly false as before then we would of come at him guns blazing and his unclaim would seem weak. You overestimate your anticipation.<br>\n<br>\nAlso if it were so obvious mafia would surely uncover the truth soon anyways, so lying from it would only cause a situation where the start of d2 conversation revolves around this which would only greatly hinder our progress (&gt;implying ran,sensfan not mafia). <br>\n<br>\nOther than this, there are numerous times when SensFan simply acts elitist despite the fact that he has shown no advanced understanding of mafia or any concepts to be had in this game. He 1) assumes we are all idiots 2) assumes that we need him to find mafia, yet 3) assumes that we all have all of his posts and their mystic translations right in front of us and that we even have the mystic translations. By that I mean he posts things using heavy sarcasm and implications that sometimes I don't know what the fuck he is actually saying and all it looks like to me is waffling mafia. He can't decide the proper opinion so he acts like it is obvious and just keeps moving forward, refusing to put anything together like I am now. <div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\"> If you want to hold my hand, then by all means try, however I warn you that my vote does not come blindly. If you want people to follow your judgment, logic and poise is needed, assholes won't be leading town (I don't like anyone leading town, but SensFan sure as hell does). </div><br>\n<br>\nImportant scumtell on Sensefan is that he is forcing townies to dig for information on him in a 44 page speed game. This slows down the game a ton and hinders progression while keeping town focused on trivial things. He did the same thing much earlier with the fakeclaim.<br>\n<br>\nOkay, here's what MAY of happened with the mason claims. It is possible that Toast and SensFan are scum together and that SensFan was seeing if Toast would bite on his scum gambit. Toast didn't and now they have this entirely different gambit in which it seems now like SenseFan is town and Toast is as well. Don't be fooled, you may very well be looking in the wrong direction here, don't let them shift your eyes to the claims, the claim isn't what is interesting, it is the response that is. Toasts first two posts after the claim are ones that could of been played off as \"SensFan is mafia!\" or, \"SensFan is right, we are masons but he is an idiot\". Tread carefully town.<br>\n<br>\nWhen responding to this post (and you better respond, ignoring it will result in me attacking you the whole day) please do so orderly and logically. Do not simply state \"well cunthead, if /is/ obvious and you should go fuck yourslef for not understanding that\", or \"whatever beck is mafia\", or even \"I'm not mafia\" since those are things that you have proven are not above you in terms of skill.", "time": "Tue Jul 12, 2011 3:24 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=18169&start=1125", "forum": "53", "thread": "18169"}

Lunch is coming soon.<br>\n<br>\nNew guy, thoughts on toast, myself, ran, pine, and spyrex</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Toast</div></div> 6/10 town<br>\n<br>\nFirst of all, I didn't know that I was going to make these so I'm actually writing them during day 2 here, I guys I figured you guys wouldn't care to read them. Anyways I think that Toast reacted to the mason claim very strangely. If I recall his first two posts to the mason claim were ones that could of gone either way. He could of played it as \"Yes! I am a mason!\" or \"No! SensFan is mafia!\". This is suspicious as the scenario I described earlier being true could mean waffling scum. I understand the towntell when he self voted, however I highly doubt there was any chance of that lynch going through. I think it is a null tell because as of yet I can't see if it is a mafia gambit or a town reaction. Too easy to fake. However, the rest of his posting seems pretty solid, for the most part he was good at articulating what he wanted to say and his reads. His votes may of been a little obvious but that is probably because his opinions were mafia towards ones who we voted. I don't find him scummy in the rest of his posting all that much at all.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Beck</div> Town 8/10<br>\n<br>\nI'm sorry but you can be very elitist and a bit of an asshole. That is hard to like but I am also an asshole sometimes so I will get past that when I read your posting. You are very active (despite posting a lot of noise/fluff) and you are very firm in your beliefs. I really like what I'm getting from you because for the most part it is actually really good. You know how you feel and why and you are good at explaining why you think that you are right. However sometimes you slack on this and don't really do a good job of articulating yourself. I don't have specific examples but if I recall there were also posts where you just stated something and assumed that everyone understood why you thought that, which is always bad for town. It's funny because you have the most content, but I don't have a lot to say about you, although maybe that isn't so true as despite having over 300 posts, a lot of it is contentless.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Ranmaru</div> Town 5/10<br>\n<br>\nFirst of all one of the few people to have a actual wrote out scum case on <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3227600#p3227600\" class=\"postlink\">Blinker</a> and I thought his was the best by far. He went post by post in a detailed manner that got his point across. His cop fakeclaim was very bad though, because 1) We had already had 1 failed fakeclaim and all this one did like the other was hinder our progress. 2) I believe is screwed up, and didn't do his soft claim during day1, but rather during pregame? If this is true then he could be a scumslipped mafia, but I couldn't really understand if that was the case or not so <div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">could someone clarify that for me?</div>. Before his fakeclaim he is an average town and I like that in him, he doesn't have big posts though but they are pretty well spaced and they all(for the most part) have content. After his fakeclaim however, excluding when he talks about Blinkers scumtells, he is much less useful and has a ton less content. I believe this<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\"> could </div>mean that he was actually expecting to coast on the cop claim, which would be a mafia move, which could further indicate a scumslip. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Pine</div> Mafia 4/10<br>\n<br>\nOnly 32 posts so that is definitely not something he has going for him, that's about 11 posts a day, but in speed mafia you have to be able to post a lot more. First off he didn't post in pregame at all although he confirms about 60 posts after daystart. It makes me feel like he may of intentionally waited until the day started to post anything to avoid being involved in festivities early. What I don't like about his opinions though (not a scumtell really but an annoyance) is that he says not to take pregame seriously. Anything posted by anyone in this thread will be used as scumtells, to not do so is to be an idiot. In fact it could be called a scum tell because he doesn't want to have such a headstart on scumhunting. However going over this posts I now realize that he posted a steady stream of posts, and that all of(minus obvious ones like the \"ohshit 40 pages\" post) his posts are ones that are decent or better. He didn't support the blinker lynch although I'm not sure why, he says that <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/posting.php?mode=quote&amp;f=2&amp;p=3228298\" class=\"postlink\">there hasn't been a case against him that he has like</a>but if he looked <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3227600#p3227600\" class=\"postlink\">here</a>is a detailed outline of a scum case on blinker. He didn't go point by point against it, and this happened before his post. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Spyrex</div> Mafia 4/10<br>\n<br>\nGod spyrex, why do you have to be so cryptic with all this weird <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3216331#p3216331\" class=\"postlink\">posting</a>? You claim that three people are insta-town which implies your role somehow means that, but there's no way I can see that is possible. 4 man mason group? Yeah right, and if there was then Toast would have confirmed SensFan. I really don't know how else you could be so sure this early in the game of those three people. I looked over the roles and I still can't understand it. He votes blinker over <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3218935#p3218935\" class=\"postlink\">policy</a> although I think it was more of him saying he thought blinker was mafia in a silly way. Then he says he's <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/posting.php?mode=quote&amp;f=2&amp;p=3228854\" class=\"postlink\">angry</a> with the blinker lynch before it even goes through. Despite saying that he was all for blinker mafia beforehand, this is very strange to me. The alliance post was also very strange as I couldn't tell if he was serious or how committed he was. He didn't articulate what he wanted strongly after the post and no one responded to it. I don't understand alliances but regardless his cryptic belief in three peoples' alignment makes me very confused.", "time": "Tue Jul 12, 2011 4:11 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=18169&start=1150", "forum": "53", "thread": "18169"}

Before his fakeclaim he is an average town and I like that in him, he doesn't have big posts though but they are pretty well spaced and they all(for the most part) have content. After his fakeclaim however, excluding when he talks about Blinkers scumtells, he is much less useful and has a ton less content. I believe this could mean that he was actually expecting to coast on the cop claim, which would be a mafia move, which could further indicate a scumslip.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nAgain, I planned gambitting day cop from the start. It wasn't the best but I was asking everyone for their new stances, and I'm sure you could have found more info from that. I screwed up because I forgot that the game didn't officially start until ALOT later but I would claim Day Cop because I didn't want to claim cop because it's more likely there is a cop then a Day cop. I don't want to out pr's. <br>\n<br>\nWell I guess when people started guessing my claim was fake I wanted to wait for most of everyone's reactions to it before I confirmed it was a lie. I wanted to wait for spy but he posted in other games a few times before saying anything and I couldn't afford to wait for him longer. <br>\n<br>\nI wanted to lynch Yank but I guessed it wasn't happening and I auto lynched to Blinker because I didn't think I could get a push at the last minute. You could say this was a negative to my gambit claim but I think there are positives to it as well.<br>\n<br>\nI don't know if I coasted that much when I was believed to have been a day cop though. Which period of time did you think I was useless? (I wasn't intending on coasting and not helping town)</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nUpon a closer read of your ISO you made more strong posts than I thought. But there was still a lot of filler posting. I'm not really sure how to go about proving this, I really don't want to quote half your ISO to show things you did well and wrong.

I claimed ON Tracker with a result on Beck. He then comes out and says \"that makes no sense with a full tracker\". I prodded him and asked him if he was claiming full Tracker, and he backed off and said \"no, 1-shot tracker.\" Then Bob comes around and claims EN Tracker. ON and EN Tracker make a nice pair of town roles that roughly add up to 1 Full Tracker. One ON Tracker and one 1-shot Tracker make less sense, especially with a claimed EN Tracker. It makes more sense if the only Town Trackers are a pair of ON/EN Trackers, with a 1-shot Scum Tracker. It also makes sense if Beck is Scum but not a Tracker, and is now scrambling trying to figure out what to do. If he confirms his role as a Tracker, and then tomorrow Bob is also able to confirm his role as a Tracker, then I think we need to start assuming that there's a Mafia Tracker on the prowl.

Then his next post says that he <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3228328#p3228328\" class=\"postlink\">doesn't</a> believe the cop claim. He says that only someone as competent as he could see through the /obvious/ fakeclaim. I feel that the only reason it would be so obvious to him would be if he were scum and knew that the report on him were fake (&gt;implying not GF/SK, as far as those roles go, I doubt that they are SensFan). Then he says that he was trying to quickhammer blinker before anyone could out Ran as fake. However this contradicts with the fact that he say it was /obvious/ that Ran was fakeclaiming and that if he were his scum partner he would have bussed his ass all day.  Not only that but it wasn't even obvious, no one had come to the clearcut conclusion that it was a fakeclaim, and the person who the inno is on is the only person who could know that (&gt;implying mafia &gt;not including cop). His bus theory is because we are running around \"lynching all liars\" but that is not true as obviously shown. There is no wagon on Toast, and there is no wagon on SensFan (the two liars), that is why the claim was so weird, SensFan had little if any pressure when he claimed so there was no reason to fakeclear him. Toast only had pressure from Beck, and SensFan highly disregards Becks' opinion so it makes no sense why he would bus someone using the concepts that someone whom he thinks so lowly of uses. <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3228412#p3228412\" class=\"postlink\">This</a>post is scummy because SensFan says \"connect the dots\" which would lead to Ran being shown as scum. However SensFan, in what world would town finding this out the next day be better for Ran OR you than if we got it out in the open now? If the claim was as blatantly false as before then we would of come at him guns blazing and his unclaim would seem weak. You overestimate your anticipation.</div></blockquote><br>\nAlright, so a few things to clear up. First of all, I like not being lynched. I know it's arrogant of me, but there you have it. I particularly don't like being lynched in games like this where I have such strong reads, but don't yet have the support to get the Scum lynched. So in that sense, I was being completely selfish insofar as \"As long as his Cop claim is believed, I won't be lynched. This is good news for me, so we should keep his Cop claim believed.\" That's why I wanted him not to be busted for as long as possible. Secondly, I happen to have a great deal of Skype Mafia experience with Ran, which I don't think anyone else here does. Therefore, I happen to know that the DayCop was very likely faked (in fact, he took this play from me; I've often started discussion in Skype/FtF Mafia games with fake DayCop claims). So, I think that does a good job of explaining why I thought it was obvious it was faked, while also not having it be obvious to players other than me.<br>\nThat also ties in to the bussing argument. Because I know he was lying while no one else did, if I was Scum I could have completely buried him by claiming Mason or something else of the sort, and I don't think it would have been too difficult to show how obvious it was faked.<br>\nAs for why waiting until longer, I was hoping that I would manage to get Beck lynched yesterday, and then I would not only get rid of one of the people trying hardest to lynch me, I would also have a resume to show everyone else that I <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">am</div> genuinely scumhunting and that I led a D1 Scumlynch.<br>\nI think this answers everything in that paragraph. If I missed something, let me know.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Junpei wrote:</cite>Other than this, there are numerous times when SensFan simply acts elitist despite the fact that he has shown no advanced understanding of mafia or any concepts to be had in this game. He 1) assumes we are all idiots 2) assumes that we need him to find mafia, yet 3) assumes that we all have all of his posts and their mystic translations right in front of us and that we even have the mystic translations. By that I mean he posts things using heavy sarcasm and implications that sometimes I don't know what the fuck he is actually saying and all it looks like to me is waffling mafia. He can't decide the proper opinion so he acts like it is obvious and just keeps moving forward, refusing to put anything together like I am now. <div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\"> If you want to hold my hand, then by all means try, however I warn you that my vote does not come blindly. If you want people to follow your judgment, logic and poise is needed, assholes won't be leading town (I don't like anyone leading town, but SensFan sure as hell does). </div></div></blockquote><br>\nFirst of all, I am elitist insofar as I trust my judgement more than newer players. With all due respect to people in this game, I have 5 years of MafiaScum experience, while many of the people in this game don't have 5 months of experience. Therefore, I don't think it's too much of a stretch for me to trust my scum reads more than those of players with less experience. On that note, if you do want to look at Elitism at a scumtell, you should look at Beck. He's the one that came in guns blazing with \"OMG IM SO MUCH BETTER THAN YOU MS IDIOTS\" \"DONT SAY IT AS A FACT THAT MS IS BETTER THAN WHERE I CAME FROM\", and so forth.<br>\nYes, I assume that a lot of people were idiots based on their D1 posting. I stand by that. It's inconceivable to me that someone would think that Toast was faking all of his Newb posts, up to and including hesitating on counterclaiming my Mason claim until he was sure that me being a Mason with him would also mean that he was a Mason with me. It's also somewhat hard for me to understand that no one else sees the blatant hypocrisy that Beck has displayed all game long, and that is sometimes expressed at frustration on my part that not everyone else sees things as readily as I do.<br>\nWhen it comes to the accusations of waffling, I really don't see where you're coming from. I think I've been very clear and consistent with my reads all game long, and I don't think I've waffled on anyone. Beck is Scum, Toast is Town, etc...<br>\nI think this covers everything here, but I'm really not sure. If anything else needs clarification, just speak up.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Junpei wrote:</cite>Important scumtell on Sensefan is that he is forcing townies to dig for information on him in a 44 page speed game. This slows down the game a ton and hinders progression while keeping town focused on trivial things. He did the same thing much earlier with the fakeclaim.</div></blockquote><br>\nIt being a speed game doesn't change the fact that I expect people to keep up and read on their own.<br>\nAs far as the Mason claim goes, it was just the opposite. Reasoned argument isn't the forte of some of the most vocal anti-Toast people from yesterday, so I figured that the fastest way to sweep away the ridiculous Toast wagon was to just claim Masons with him. I argue that if Toast hadn't been so rushed to call me out as a liar that it would have worked, and that it was the backlash from being called a liar that led to time being wasted, not the Mason claim itself.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Junpei wrote:</cite>Okay, here's what MAY of happened with the mason claims. It is possible that Toast and SensFan are scum together and that SensFan was seeing if Toast would bite on his scum gambit. Toast didn't and now they have this entirely different gambit in which it seems now like SenseFan is town and Toast is as well. Don't be fooled, you may very well be looking in the wrong direction here, don't let them shift your eyes to the claims, the claim isn't what is interesting, it is the response that is. Toasts first two posts after the claim are ones that could of been played off as \"SensFan is mafia!\" or, \"SensFan is right, we are masons but he is an idiot\". Tread carefully town.</div></blockquote><br>\nI can't really defend to this beyond \"No, because I'm not Mafia with Toast\", which I know isn't convincing. If there's anything I can clear up about this, let me know, but I think it's just one of those things that I have to accept that the possibility of it exists.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Junpei wrote:</cite>When responding to this post (and you better respond, ignoring it will result in me attacking you the whole day) please do so orderly and logically.

Although his rushing was scummy to me for another reason. What does the person with the inno knowing that mean? What should he have done that that he didn't?<br>\n</li><li>I would think in this town scum would go along with the LAL to get an easy myslynch. I have explained the clear was to get stances from other players and not to save him. Tell me if my play didn't line up with that purpose.<br>\n</li><li>I don't see how 'connecting the dots' would essentially paint me as scum. Him saying that would mean that Beck found out the mistake in my gambit, which has nothing to do with alignment. Your question is irrelevant because of what I just expressed in the previous sentence. <br>\n</li><li>He was quick to go on the record to say that he knew I was gambitting, but I could tell that others could tell it seemed like a Gambit. May be possible that Sens said that early to gain town cred.<br>\n<div align=\"center\"><hr style=\"height:14px;width:100%\"></div><br>\n</li><li>Well mafia might want to uncover it to unclear the person who was cleared as town. It was uncovered by Beck.<br>\n<div align=\"center\"><hr style=\"height:14px;width:100%\"></div><br>\n</li><li>Elitist, Asshole. He usually is that way. Either way this is null because someone's TONE should not be used for alignment.<br>\n</li><li>You are right that he doesn't give most of the town credit. Most of the town seems a bit newbie so he should give others slack. I do like that he said that he was trying to show an example. I don't think we need him for finding the mafia but I feel that is also null and him being arrogant. Lazyness again, seems scummy because it's been a while and after 'finding scum' he also has to convince us, which he hasn't.<br>\n</li><li>I feel it's more that he is being really stubborn regardless of alignment so him waffling isn't a good point to me. Substantiate that further.<br>\n</li><li>I feel the \"I don't like town leaders\" comment is unneeded for this case, because it is your preference and leading town is not a bad thing. Town just has to be smart enough to have a good read on the 'town' leader.<br>\n<div align=\"center\"><hr style=\"height:14px;width:100%\"></div><br>\n</li><li>I may agree with this. Sensfan, why u so lazy?<br>\n<div align=\"center\"><hr style=\"height:14px;width:100%\"></div><br>\n</li><li>Well first Sensfan initiated it and it doesn't mean it was previously planned from the both of them. I have experienced someone claiming masons to clear me to lynch [redacted], which worked. [ongoing] So it is viable Toast hasn't known about it AND Toast's reaction to it was EXACTLY like mine because he doesn't know Sens is town so he feels the best option is to lynch Sens for it. Toast is also a town read of yours so I don't think it is viable, and therefore this 'possibility' is null and void. Toast's \"Town slip\" is NULL like I have always said.</li></ul></div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\n1) So you agree?<br>\n2) I don't understand this bullet at all -.-<br>\n3) The is that he implied that he thought that the claim was real, so saying that he caught onto it immediately makes no sense since he showed that he at one point didn't see it.<br>\n4) He waffled on whether or not to show that he knew (if he did). The inno knowing (&gt;implying he's inno) means that they know that it is either a legit claim or a reaction test. SensFan's actions don't make sense if he thought either, the latter because he only wastes some time before attacking it as a fakeclaim. The former because he attacked it as a fake claim.<br>\n5) Well SensFan WAS a liar, going through with that ideal would mean a self lynch. Your play does appear to do what you said you had done, in my opinion.<br>\n6) I meant paint you as a liar, sorry that was a typo. Given your intentions my question seems irrelevant, but there's no way that SensFan knew your precise intentions<br>\n7) There was nothing conclusive, show me a post from each player that implied they were caught onto it.<br>\n<br>\n8) Okay that doesn't really respond at all to what I wrote. I was saying that since it was so obvious that hiding it another day would only make mafia point it out the next day since it was so /easy/ to figure out. Which would cause a shitstorm that could lead to either ones' death.<br>\n<br>\n9) I agree <br>\n10) I'm not a newbie and there's no reason to assume everyone else is. This is a speed game and people are probably not used to it. I don't need him to show me how I should play and how to scumhunt, and he hasn't. He is making it clear that he won't hold our hands.<br>\n11) \"Well its' so obvious\" \"If you had two brain cells to rub together you'd know it's obvious\".

SensFan's reaction is one that I do not like at all, and I would like to see what you think of my analysis. He first does not even acknowledge the claim at all, going on about beck and his excuse for why he has presented no case on Beck (I do not like this in the slightest, I feel like if he really were as confident a town as he claim he would make the case. Scum often skip this step because they already know who scum is and it feels like a waste of time). Then, <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3228302#p3228302\" class=\"postlink\">he implies he believes the claim</a> and that there is no reason not to trust it. Then his next post says that he <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3228328#p3228328\" class=\"postlink\">doesn't</a> believe the cop claim. He says that only someone as competent as he could see through the /obvious/ fakeclaim. I feel that the only reason it would be so obvious to him would be if he were scum and knew that the report on him were fake (&gt;implying not GF/SK, as far as those roles go, I doubt that they are SensFan). Then he says that he was trying to quickhammer blinker before anyone could out Ran as fake. However this contradicts with the fact that he say it was /obvious/ that Ran was fakeclaiming and that if he were his scum partner he would have bussed his ass all day.  Not only that but it wasn't even obvious, no one had come to the clearcut conclusion that it was a fakeclaim, and the person who the inno is on is the only person who could know that (&gt;implying mafia &gt;not including cop). His bus theory is because we are running around \"lynching all liars\" but that is not true as obviously shown. There is no wagon on Toast, and there is no wagon on SensFan (the two liars), that is why the claim was so weird, SensFan had little if any pressure when he claimed so there was no reason to fakeclear him. Toast only had pressure from Beck, and SensFan highly disregards Becks' opinion so it makes no sense why he would bus someone using the concepts that someone whom he thinks so lowly of uses. <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3228412#p3228412\" class=\"postlink\">This</a>post is scummy because SensFan says \"connect the dots\" which would lead to Ran being shown as scum. However SensFan, in what world would town finding this out the next day be better for Ran OR you than if we got it out in the open now? If the claim was as blatantly false as before then we would of come at him guns blazing and his unclaim would seem weak. You overestimate your anticipation.</div></blockquote><br>\n-------------<br>\nAlright, so a few things to clear up. First of all, I like not being lynched. I know it's arrogant of me, but there you have it. I particularly don't like being lynched in games like this 1<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">where I have such strong reads</div>, but don't yet have the support to get the Scum lynched. So in that sense, I was being completely selfish insofar as \"As long as his Cop claim is believed, I won't be lynched. This is good news for me, so we should keep his Cop claim believed.\" 3<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">That's why I wanted him not to be busted for as long as possible</div>. Secondly, I happen to have a great deal of Skype Mafia experience with Ran, which I don't think anyone else here does. Therefore, I happen to know that the DayCop was very likely faked (in fact, he took this play from me; 2<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">I've often started discussion in Skype/FtF Mafia games with fake DayCop claims</div>). So, I think that does a good job of explaining why I thought it was obvious it was faked, while also not having it be obvious to players other than me.<br>\nThat also ties in to the bussing argument. Because I know he was lying while no one else did, if I was Scum I could have completely buried him by claiming Mason or something else of the sort, and I don't think it would have been too difficult to show how obvious it was faked.<br>\nAs for why waiting until longer, 3<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">I was hoping that I would manage to get Beck lynched yesterday</div>, and then I would not only get rid of one of the people trying hardest to lynch me, I would also have a resume to show everyone else that I <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">am</div> genuinely scumhunting and that I led a D1 Scumlynch.<br>\nI think this answers everything in that paragraph. If I missed something, let me know.<br>\n-------------<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Junpei wrote:</cite>Other than this, there are numerous times when SensFan simply acts elitist despite the fact that he has shown no advanced understanding of mafia or any concepts to be had in this game. He 1) assumes we are all idiots 2) assumes that we need him to find mafia, yet 3) assumes that we all have all of his posts and their mystic translations right in front of us and that we even have the mystic translations. By that I mean he posts things using heavy sarcasm and implications that sometimes I don't know what the fuck he is actually saying and all it looks like to me is waffling mafia. He can't decide the proper opinion so he acts like it is obvious and just keeps moving forward, refusing to put anything together like I am now. <div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\"> If you want to hold my hand, then by all means try, however I warn you that my vote does not come blindly. If you want people to follow your judgment, logic and poise is needed, assholes won't be leading town (I don't like anyone leading town, but SensFan sure as hell does). </div></div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nFirst of all, I am elitist insofar as I trust my judgement more than newer players. With all due respect to people in this game, I have 5 years of MafiaScum experience, while many of the people in this game don't have 5 months of experience. Therefore, I don't think it's too much of a stretch for me to trust my scum reads more than those of players with less experience. On that note,4<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\"> if you do want to look at Elitism at a scumtell, you should look at Beck</div>. He's the one that came in guns blazing with \"OMG IM SO MUCH BETTER THAN YOU MS IDIOTS\" \"DONT SAY IT AS A FACT THAT MS IS BETTER THAN WHERE I CAME FROM\", and so forth.<br>\n5<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Yes, I assume that a lot of people were idiots based on their D1 posting. I stand by that</div>. It's inconceivable to me that someone would think that Toast was faking all of his Newb posts, up to and including hesitating on counterclaiming my Mason claim until he was sure that me being a Mason with him would also mean that he was a Mason with me. It's also somewhat hard for me to understand that no one else sees the blatant hypocrisy that Beck has displayed all game long, and that is sometimes expressed at frustration on my part that not everyone else sees things as readily as I do.<br>\n6<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">When it comes to the accusations of waffling,</div> I really don't see where you're coming from. I think I've been very clear and consistent with my reads all game long, and I don't think I've waffled on anyone. Beck is Scum, Toast is Town, etc...<br>\nI think this covers everything here, but I'm really not sure. If anything else needs clarification, just speak up.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Junpei wrote:</cite>Important scumtell on Sensefan is that he is forcing townies to dig for information on him in a 44 page speed game. This slows down the game a ton and hinders progression while keeping town focused on trivial things. He did the same thing much earlier with the fakeclaim.</div></blockquote><br>\nIt being a speed game doesn't change the fact that I expect people to keep up and read on their own.<br>\nAs far as the Mason claim goes, it was just the opposite. Reasoned argument isn't the forte of some of the most vocal anti-Toast people from yesterday, 7<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">so I figured that the fastest way to sweep away the ridiculous Toast wagon was to just claim Masons with him</div>. I argue that if Toast hadn't been so rushed to call me out as a liar that it would have worked, and that it was the backlash from being called a liar that led to time being wasted, not the Mason claim itself.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Junpei wrote:</cite>Okay, here's what MAY of happened with the mason claims. It is possible that Toast and SensFan are scum together and that SensFan was seeing if Toast would bite on his scum gambit. Toast didn't and now they have this entirely different gambit in which it seems now like SenseFan is town and Toast is as well. Don't be fooled, you may very well be looking in the wrong direction here, don't let them shift your eyes to the claims, the claim isn't what is interesting, it is the response that is. Toasts first two posts after the claim are ones that could of been played off as \"SensFan is mafia!\" or, \"SensFan is right, we are masons but he is an idiot\". Tread carefully town.</div></blockquote><br>\n8<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">I can't really defend to this beyond \"No, because I'm not Mafia with Toast\", which I know isn't convincing. If there's anything I can clear up about this, let me know, but I think it's just one of those things that I have to accept that the possibility of it exists.</div><br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Junpei wrote:</cite>When responding to this post (and you better respond, ignoring it will result in me attacking you the whole day) please do so orderly and logically. Do not simply state \"well cunthead, if /is/ obvious and you should go fuck yourslef for not understanding that\", or \"whatever beck is mafia\", or even \"I'm not mafia\" since those are things that you have proven are not above you in terms of skill.</div></blockquote><br>\n9<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">There you go.

I'll just say this: I think that you are town for different reasons than I think Toast is town.<br>\n<br>\nAs for the waffling, the only waffling I've done is between whether or not SensFan is mafia. Now I sometimes make posts for the pure essence of encouraging someone to post and give their insights. If you've noticed, I've gotten SensFan to work with me more, and I think that we're finally making some real progress. The issue with thinking SensFan is scum means that most likely CyberBob is scum, however it might be possible that there's only one of EO trackers. Or possibly the real match to CyberBob (if he's tracker) is still remaining hidden. I don't think that Cyber Bob is mafia at this point because for the time being I buy his story. Although now you say that he is posting in forum 62 so maybe I need to rethink this. If he indeed is dodging this thread then I would have to say I think he is mafia. What little he has posted I liked if I look at it alone, however if I see it and then realize how it looks in perspective to the hundreds of posts that we have, it looks much worse. If he is telling the truth he is town in my eyes, however with this new information it appears he may be a liar. SensFan has been very scummy to me all game, and all my points haven't been refuted (Ran's post I think touched on more of the details) and I'll wait to hear back from him on that. There are still high variables like TwistedSpoon whom I get town vibes from but he hasn't posted enough and I can't really say I'm sure. <br>\n<br>\nBasically I am liking what some of SensFan is posting, however the day 1 stuff and early-mid currenttime d2 stuff is bad. Recently it has gotten better overall. I'm not sure what to think of it though as I need more analysis on the subject which will be important once the scumcase involving you and sensfan clears up. You guys need to get this finished up so that we can also look at others as possible scum. I'm uncertain in my feelings of him anymore. however if I had to make a stand, I would still say scum. I know that i said town not too long ago, but that was to encourage him (although at the time I posted it had some truth to it because I was initially very happy at his efforts) and after more thought I'm still /confident/ that he is probably mafia. He hasn't convinced me yet, however he has definitely worked towards it.<br>\n<br>\nYou are either mafia tracker or town tracker, I am pretty certain you are town tracker. I called you  mafia and pressured you just so you would spill the beans on who I visited, it almost looked like though that you were mafia non-tracker who was caught.

Until then you can ask for specific people but due to inactives they may be lacking unless you ask for someone who is more relevant.

Junpei is on the drugs and I'll get to this but if anyone in this* tryst is scum its going to be him.<br>\n3.5) Watching Ran switch gears (<a href=\"http://mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=3237666#p3237666\" class=\"postlink\">http://mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.ph ... 6#p3237666</a>) would be where DBK's ghost should go.<br>\n3.75) Bob's claim is the one that smells real bad here. Not necessary and its pretty much a \"I should be alive tonight guyz\"<br>\n4.) Noramp's #1311 is the kind of thing death is made for.<br>\n5.) This whole encryption thing is pants on head and if it were me modding I'd have nuked every last one of you for it.<br>\n<br>\nThat said lets get to the heart of it:<br>\n1.) Sensfan correctly claimed Beck's target (odd night).<br>\n2.) Beck correctly claimed Jun's target (1 shot).<br>\n3.) Jun hasn't claimed his role.<br>\n4.) Bob claimed even night tracker. <br>\n<br>\n1 &amp; 2 are only fakeclaiming if BOTH are scum OR if Beck AND Jun are scum. That's right out. So, we're left with trackerZ to deal with. Sens tracking Beck makes perfect sense. Beck, I'd like a quick rundown on why on Jun and I swear to god if you say read this thread just kill yourself because that's not the important part:<br>\n<br>\n#3 is a kicker. Not too many roles are going to be visiting someone without making them dead. Cop? Thats RIGHT out. Watcher? So highly doubtful not worth considering. So, we're left with 3 roles realistically: Doc, Roleblocker, Jailer. <br>\n<br>\nHere's where it gets interesting: Jun-doc based on his own \"reads\" has no business visiting Toast. Jun-jailer stuffing toast RIGHT in the middle makes very little sense either - you either use jailer offensively (Me/Pine) or defensively (Beck). <br>\n<br>\nWhat does that leave boys and girls? Yep. Roleblocker. Which makes a lot of sense on someone who multiple people think are town BUT you want to leave around for the Sens shenanigans...which happened right out of the gate.<br>\n<br>\n#4 is a hard pill to swallow. I could see a 1-shot / even / odd trackers | vig up against a madness scumteam (RB, Hitman, etc) but even then three trackers and a vig flipped means that is it AND there's no protective roles up ins. <br>\n<br>\nSo of this particular mess unless its the Sens/Beck scum-show which, honestly, I would have to applaud I'm not seeing it.<br>\n<br>\nJun for dead. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Unvote, Vote: Jun</div>", "time": "Tue Jul 12, 2011 6:18 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=18169&start=1625", "forum": "53", "thread": "18169"}

I wouldn't be surprised if Beck and Sens are the same faction, whether that is scum or town. And I'm not really seeing the scum case on Junpei.

If it looked like I was mimicking you in my badgering against SensFan then that's because he hadn't solved a lot of the issues he didn't solve last game day (some he still is yet to solve). My town read on you was justified, and I'm not the only one who had it. The only other person who compares is Toast and I had an itchy feeling about him which I will get to later. You didn't give me every single name, but besides you were one of the most townlike people I could see. Sure it is true that I didn't go in depth or read every post with the mindset of \"what is he saying/thinking here?\" and I did glaze over some parts. But I still feel like that is justifiable and that my read is still a strong one for me. <br>\n<br>\nAlso if you can't read between the lines on that post then you are trying to hard to find evidence to fit the conclusion that I am scum<br>\n<br>\nThe biggest pusher of revealing who I visited was Toast who advocated the idea of how to go about doing it. It was explained to me how it was the optimal choice and the logic made perfect sense. If you read my ISO you'd see that I pointed that out to you long before you claimed who I visited. It is that revealing who I visited does not reveal my role which would give info to mafia. However it does allow town to confirm you as tracker to some extent.<br>\n<br>\nThe reason why I was pressuring you was so that you would tell them who I visited which was the whole point of the plan. You were being stubborn and it was annoying that you weren't listening to logic that had been spelled out in a single post. I told you that I had found a possible flaw in the gd5 plan a long time before that, I said I'd announce it after you posted or soon afterward, and you commented on it. I just wanted Toast to confirm that it is impossible, and it was another way to pressure you into telling us who I visited. <br>\n<br>\nOnce again, I was trying to pressure you like everyone else to claim who I visited, it was a viable plan and you didn't go with it until you were pressured a lot.<br>\n<br>\n... <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3239752#p3239752\" class=\"postlink\">1630</a> was a response to [/url=<a href=\"http://mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=3239700#p3239700\" class=\"postlink\">http://mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.ph ... 0#p3239700</a>] Spyrex's 1626 [/url]. <br>\n<br>\n\"bunch of random posts that are scummy/dont make sense\" Examples? Or were those posts the ones you were talking about?<br>\n<br>\nThe reason that nocamp's explanation was longer was because I hadn't already written paragraph(s) on everyone else's scumminess. It isn't like there's time for me to say \"I think this person is scummy because this!\" when we have been engaged in a steady clusterfuck of PR madness/Beck vs. SensFan pissfights. Besides, I had like no notes on this guy, it was only when I realized this that I said \"hey wait a minute\". I hadn't really ranked my scumtells until you had asked me to in order. That isn't how I format them.<br>\n<br>\nRest is about Pine, Ran and Noramp I believe.<br>\n<br>\nOh and I see your point about SensFan, and it makes sense to me actually. I'm a little confused as to how he could portray scum tells like in my original posts but that does make sense. Well that has been noted by me, I'm a little surprised that there is logic that makes him look so town. I need to rethink who I think is scum, there just isn't much time to do it.<br>\n<br>\nOh, and my role as well as reasoning as to why I chose toast.<br>\n<br>\nI am the Jailkeeper<br>\n<br>\nNow, first let me explain why specifically I chose Toast. It all had to do with the mason claim. I thought that he handled it very carefully, he wasn't abrupt with what he was going to do and that made me think that he might be indecisive about what to respond with. Yet once he did respond he seemed confident and acted as if it was his original intent. My town tells on Toast was because of his posting afterward. Since then he has been a very strong townsperson and has done a good job scumhunting. However, mafia can scumhunt and mafia can get townreads, that mason claim was very odd to me and I wasn't sure what to think. I thought that it may be possible that they are both scum, or perhaps Toast and Sens really are mason together. Or possibly it was something else entirely. Regardless, he was someone who I really felt was involved in something suspicious regardless of alignment. I wanted to be sure he lived if town and possibly block is role if he was a scum role. He was very odd to me due to that mason \"shenangigans\" as you put it. He was something of a wild card on my scumdial. I know I said that SpyreX is weird and he is for different reasons that I will get to.<br>\n<br>\nNow, SensFan and Beck were no-gos because I knew they'd probably be alive the next day because they were at each others throats, and why would mafia not want that? Of course it is also possible that they are both scum, in which case they'd most likely be alive as well. I didn't bother messing with them as they each had their own agenda, Toast was a better bet. SpyreX was another strong candidate due to his cryptic silliness, but I had trouble understanding your alliance and your \"tells\". I was pretty much scared away from touching you as I didn't understand your posts one bit, but it seemed everyone else did. CyberBob was a choice, although I liked what he posted when he did, Toast was far better a choice for reasons stated. Pine is very similar to CyberBob in that respect as he also posted posts I liked despite having a scummy attribute. But toasts' scum attribute was more compelling. I thought about Ranmaru for a brief period, but found that despite his fakeclaim being dumb, it wasn't odd in the same strange way Toasts' involvement was. I didn't really consider him much to be honest I didn't go in depth on him in my thought process, I didn't have much time I guess I forgot. But if I look back I would say that his screwup with the pregame softclaiming wasn't something that scum would easily do. I'd think that they'd be more careful in their actions than to do something so stupid. That leaves TwistedSpoon and Noramp. I recall skimming their posts and finding nothing that would make me fall for them over Toast. I saw the Jailkeeper role as a lockdown role, something that completely shuts off the target from everyone, if there was one person who I could choose to have not interfere, it would be Toast for the reasons described. I didn't use the Jailkeeper as a pure offense or defense role, more of a combination of the two, a conservative way so-to-speak.<br>\n<br>\nHopefully that about clears everything up for you.", "time": "Wed Jul 13, 2011 1:26 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=18169&start=1750", "forum": "53", "thread": "18169"}

Period. You take that shot on one of them putting it at 6 and, chances are, letting the mice do you work for you under the \"ohh its mylo we better no lynch\" letting you take THE OTHER shot putting it at 5. Or, now you've silenced one voice and you're going at the lynch with the same odds. Not two shots for loss.<br>\n<br>\nThe no kill there was not planned. There is no amount of reward for that risk. I would have never, ever, EVER let that happen. That is the product of absentee scum. Which, despite my gut reads on you, puts you at the least chance of being scum because of the simple fact you are active. <br>\n<br>\nAnd, that is the way this is probably going to go.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Unvote, Vote: Cyberbob</div><br>\n<br>\n-----------<br>\n<br>\nOn a different, and fairly important note. You can scream dont outguess the mod all you want but it is MY BUSINESS to outguess the mods. Half the normals ran have my hand in the setup. That is, literally, what I do. So, when in conjunction with the nokill the simple fact it'd take a lot of massaging for 3 trackers a vig AND a jk to get by I'm not buying it. It is -possible- hence the massclaim because a claim there would have been instant death for bob instead of this back and forth. <br>\n<br>\n-----------<br>\n<br>\nSo, here's the deal. There's two ways today is going down, period:<br>\n<br>\n1.) Cyberbob gets lynched. If he's scum the next lynch is MT. Pine/Ran are not scum together and while that isn't the lylo I'd like if I'm wrong about MT its the best I can do. If I'm alive as it sits I'd be voting Ran for the simple fact while I could maybe buy ONE of the wagons having no scum due to it being fast days there's no way two have no scum. <br>\n<br>\n2.) I get lynched. I am not going down for the loss at lylo. Today, when I flip town, you at MINIMUM do not listen at all to any result bob gives. Realistically you should damn well be looking back at all of this and lynching him. You can yell at me all you want if I'm wrong then.<br>\n<br>\nI'll make this real clear though because thats how this is going to be: you go with option #1 its the equivalent of the mod saying I'm town.
