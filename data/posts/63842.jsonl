Thank you for signing up for the mini normal, Jurassic Monkey!<br>\nYour role is <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#008000\">Vanilla Townie</div></div>. You have no special powers, but may vote as normal.<br>\nYou are aligned with the town, and win when all anti-town players are removed <br>\nfrom the game.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nRules<br>\n------<br>\n1. Treat others with respect, play the game the way it was meant to be played, and have a good time!<br>\n2. You may PM me at any time if your have a question, I'm human and I make mistakes. Any in game mod request should be bolded, so that I can see it. You may post any vote count errors in thread.<br>\n3. I have the final say in all rule disputes, and may change a rule at any time.<br>\n4. Days will last 14 days, and nights will last 3 days.<br>\n5. You must post once every three days. The you will receive two prods, the third offence will result in replacement. If you are unable to meet your posting obligations please VLA.<br>\n6. Red is my color, don't use it.<br>\n7. You may have up to 4 V/LA's total, 3 V/LA's in a 2 game day period, or 2 V/LA's in a one game day period. If any of these are exceeded, I will look for a replacement.<br>\n<br>\nImportant game rules(breaking these rules can result in punishment including modkill.)<br>\n1. Do not quote your role pm. You may paraphrase your role pm if you decide to do so.<br>\n2. Do not paste any correspondance you receive from me. You may paraphrase.<br>\n3. Do not talk about this game outside of the game while the game is still in progress, unless you are given permission to do so in your role PM.<br>\n4. Do not post any game information after you die.<br>\n5. Play to your win condition. This means do not out your teammates out of spite, etc.<br>\n6. No randomization.<br>\n7. Pretending to break a rule is the same as breaking it.<br>\n8. No hidden text.<br>\n<br>\nVoting rules:<br>\n1. You may vote by typing <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: Monkeyman576</div> in bold. Anything close to the correct format will count, but it must be bolded. Misspellings and votes without a colon will count. You do not have to type unvote to unvote, although if you do it helps keep track of things.<br>\n2. A player is lynched when the vote count reaches (X/2)+1 votes, where X is the number of players alive. So it there are 13 alive, it wout be 7 to lynch, with 11 alive, it would be 6 to lynch, etc. No lynches are allowed.<br>\n3. There will be 6 hours of twilight following each lynch, regardless of when I log in to check the vote count or when the lynch is announced.<br>\n4. If any player has a vote count other than 1(i.e. a non voter or double voter), it will be reflected in the vote count.<br>\n5. Each player is allowed one \"bah!\" post after they are lynched, but may not reveal any game related information after the lynch is announced.", "time": "Fri Oct 23, 2015 4:04 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=63842&start=0", "forum": "53", "thread": "63842"}

And yet pretty much everyone else is voting. It makes it much easier for people to track your primary suspect over time.

If you're town, you want us to learn your alignment. If you're scum, you absolutely don't. So which role does your play benefit more? You guessed it! Scum! If you're scum go ahead and continue to not vote as we only really want town votes anyway, makes it easier to lynch scum day 1.<br>\n<br>\nFire definitely lost his townread, by nature of having made an early move then slinking back to the shadows.

I stated that your vote helps people read your alignment, which is something that town WANTS people to do. I also called your vote bad. I don't have a case on you, per se, but you're reading a double personality here. Half of your posts are care free and include the tongue-out emoticon, and half of them seem nervous and unsettled. All of those posts regard me and my vote/read on you.

He said your trying to look like town, completely different.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\nYup. And I tried to catch him backpedaling his statement which would have indicated scum. He did not, which slightly indicates not scum (though he definitely seems too competent to fall for that, and too abrasive to care what anyone thinks to back down either so I doubt my move would have worked regardless if he's scum or not). You're certainly focusing quite hard on what I did on page 1, care to comment on things that have developed since then?<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Diego wrote:</cite><br>\nAgain, this is not scumhunting, this is throwing WIFOM into an argument to make someone else look bad.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\nI pointed out something that VERY SLIGHTLY indicated someone having a higher chance of being scum than town. How is that WIFOM? It's the opposite of WIFOM. I'm pretty confident you have absolutely no idea what WIFOM is, even moreso than the 60%+ of the time that the term is used incorrectly.<br>\n<br>\nBased on what information I had, it was the best vote I could make. I've since applied a (admittingly somewhat weak and mostly gut based, but good enough for me early D1) scum read on him. Explain again how that isn't scum hunting, please.<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Diego wrote:</cite><br>\nThis is LAMIST if I've ever seen it. Aggression is not alignment indicative.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\nWhen did I ever say that had anything to do with alignment? I have 2-5 votes on me the first few pages of virtually every game I'm in, scum or town. It was simply an honest statement.<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Diego wrote:</cite><br>\nI'm voting you because of the intent behind your aggression, which is to throw shit at the wall a see what sticks. That is scum indicative.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\nOhhhhhh so scum hunting is scummy now, got it. I guess I'd better wait for sure fire logical facts that point to someone being scum before trying to find any, huh?<br>\n<br>\nHonestly what I did early wasn't even town indicative, it was ICEninja indicative. I make early moves to get out of the RVS nearly always, because I find that stage of the game pointless.<br>\n<br>\n----------<br>\n<br>\nAlright so there's a ton of meta reads floating around right now. I'm 100% fine with people having them, as some people are quite good at finding alignment based on meta. I, personally, will not regard \"this player is playing like how he plays town\" or vice versa as alignment indicative unless there are specific examples, and usually only noticeable trends in somebody's scum game.

I stated that your vote helps people read your alignment, which is something that town WANTS people to do. I also called your vote bad. I don't have a case on you, per se, but you're reading a double personality here. Half of your posts are care free and include the tongue-out emoticon, and half of them seem nervous and unsettled. All of those posts regard me and my vote/read on you. It's giving me a gut read that you're faking stuff, and has resulted in my vote no longer being a tool with which to end the RVS, but instead an honest \"I think you're more likely to be scum than anyone else based on the available information\" vote.<br>\n<br>\n----------<br>\n<br>\nAlright as for Diego's first piece of actual content, let's tear it to pieces piece by piece.<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Diego wrote:</cite><br>\nFirebringer did not call you town. He said your trying to look like town, completely different.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\nYup. And I tried to catch him backpedaling his statement which would have indicated scum. He did not, which slightly indicates not scum (though he definitely seems too competent to fall for that, and too abrasive to care what anyone thinks to back down either so I doubt my move would have worked regardless if he's scum or not). You're certainly focusing quite hard on what I did on page 1, care to comment on things that have developed since then?<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Diego wrote:</cite><br>\nAgain, this is not scumhunting, this is throwing WIFOM into an argument to make someone else look bad.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\nI pointed out something that VERY SLIGHTLY indicated someone having a higher chance of being scum than town. How is that WIFOM? It's the opposite of WIFOM. I'm pretty confident you have absolutely no idea what WIFOM is, even moreso than the 60%+ of the time that the term is used incorrectly.<br>\n<br>\nBased on what information I had, it was the best vote I could make. I've since applied a (admittingly somewhat weak and mostly gut based, but good enough for me early D1) scum read on him. Explain again how that isn't scum hunting, please.<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Diego wrote:</cite><br>\nThis is LAMIST if I've ever seen it. Aggression is not alignment indicative.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\nWhen did I ever say that had anything to do with alignment? I have 2-5 votes on me the first few pages of virtually every game I'm in, scum or town. It was simply an honest statement.<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Diego wrote:</cite><br>\nI'm voting you because of the intent behind your aggression, which is to throw shit at the wall a see what sticks. That is scum indicative.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\nOhhhhhh so scum hunting is scummy now, got it. I guess I'd better wait for sure fire logical facts that point to someone being scum before trying to find any, huh?<br>\n<br>\nHonestly what I did early wasn't even town indicative, it was ICEninja indicative. I make early moves to get out of the RVS nearly always, because I find that stage of the game pointless.<br>\n<br>\n----------<br>\n<br>\nAlright so there's a ton of meta reads floating around right now. I'm 100% fine with people having them, as some people are quite good at finding alignment based on meta. I, personally, will not regard \"this player is playing like how he plays town\" or vice versa as alignment indicative unless there are specific examples, and usually only noticeable trends in somebody's scum game. So forgive me if I ignore any comments about, for example, Fire being town because this is how Fire acts as town. I'm not taking your word for it.</div></blockquote></div></div></div><br>\n<br>\nI'm incredibly uncertain of ICE.

I'm prone to tunneling when I find someone who I think is scum, so I try to back off quickly in case I'm missing the whole picture. I... really don't know how I should be developing my reads without it seeming broken and based solely on the work of others. What I've always done is wait until I see something really contradictory, differences between claims and realities. Based off of that mistake, I construct sets of possibilities&#8212;it could be set that the greatest flaw in my scumhunting style is that I try to understand the entirety of the game rather than to pick apart the individual opponents.

I get a town-ish vibe from him. He's asked questions, which is good.<br>\n<br>\n2. I think All Alone has tunnel vision, and I don't like that he's been active enough to post about how I'm suspicious, but to say absolutely nothing about anyone else. I don't think well of him, but there isn't enough in my mind to call him scummy. I'm probably not the best person to ask, because a person who has a vote on you innately seems more suspicious, which gives me a bias.<br>\n<br>\n3. Objectively? I don't think it's a townslip. I think that it was more a display of my individual lack of thought than any town-minded or scum-minded activity. I would have likely made the same mistake if I were scum.<br>\n<br>\n4. I haven't really factored in Fire into the whole thing, but I did give ICE and Garmr previous thought. I think that the degree to which they are tunneling each other suggests pretty heavily that they aren't a scum pair, but I wouldn't rule it out. Crazier things have happened. Taking a gander at the whole deal, I suppose that you could come to the conclusion that Fire is scum-buddy with Garmr for going against ICE but sticking with Garmr... but that seems a bit obvious. I wouldn't do that as scum under any circumstance. More likely, I think Fire internally drew the same conclusion that I did&#8212;Garmr and ICE are highly unlikely to be scum-buddies&#8212;and then further came to the conclusion that ICE was scum.

In the game where pistachi0n and I were scumbuddies, she put a lot less effort into \"figuring the game out\" than she does when she's town and actually needs to figure the game out. This game feels like the former. 3dicerolling has been voting Firebringer since page 2, yet has made very little effort since then to sort him or push him.

Well, initially I felt you were defensive in your reaction, but your tone has lightened up a bit in your recent posts. I'm still wary of you and Fire's little love circle, but the strength of it has slightly lessened due to your responses. I feel like scum in your case might have backed off sooner, but I guess it all depends on your playstyle.

My postcount isn't all by itself a good reason for anyone to accuse me of that, and in this context it reads like pistachi0n is trying to use my postcount as a reason to deflect attacks on her. A townie who genuinely feels that their play is sufficiently protown would most likely respond to attacks like these by pointing out what exactly they feel is protown about their play. It's unlikely a townie would respond by finding a town criterion they're not the worst at and riding it hard. They tend to have better arguments for their own towniness than that. Scum are much more likely not to.<br>\n<br>\nAdditionally, the last quote from pistachi0n rings pretty hollow. She says she's trying to push suspicion on players who've attacked her for not doing enough, but I don't see that anywhere in her play. Wanderer and 3dicerolling are the two players who've attacked her the hardest for that reasoning, and she hasn't pushed suspicion on either one. It reads like she didn't want to give the real reason she's pushing this angle, and made up another reason on the spot.", "time": "Mon Nov 02, 2015 3:53 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=63842&start=425", "forum": "53", "thread": "63842"}

Garmr's case is pretty solid, and in the other game I'm in with Mario, Mario's been a lot more active. Inconsistent behavior probably points towards something. I feel more strongly that Scorpius is scum than Mario, though. I think that the way Scorp hammered was suuuuper sketchy. Whole point of declaring intent to hammer is to give people time to decide, fifteen minutes is not enough time to decide. Of course, maybe that's just because I take votes a lot more seriously than everyone else.<br>\n<br>\nLooking through them, there are a lot of little tidbits that point towards Mario/Scorp being the remaining scum team. Mario goes against Scorp mostly off of gut towards the second half of the first day, but Scorp doesn't respond much, whereas Scorpius pushes against Mario earlier on but changes his mind quickly. Almost like the interaction was token, just to demonstrate that there was some conflict there. Mario's case against Scorp has never been more than gut, but in #517 he says he would have preferred a lynch on Scorp, but admits that a lynch on Davsto was probably for the best. Preferring a lynch on Scorp seems like more \"token conflict\" to keep things between he and Scorp tense enough that the passing eye won't suspect. It lacks the vitriol of the Davsto/Garmr interactions earlier, though. Scorp/Mario interactions don't have much or any back and forth, where the passion and response of Davsto/Garmr interactions heavily imply that Davsto and Garmr can't be scumteam. I'd say those interactions make Garmr more or less conftown at this point.<br>\n<br>\nI want to vote, but I'm ultimately not sure whether to vote Scorpius or Mario. I'm going to do some poking around to make my decision.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: @Mario</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\"><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7371241#p7371241\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7371241#p7371241\" data-post-id=\"7371241\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 587</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=25801\">MarioManiac4</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7370797#p7370797\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7370797#p7370797\" data-post-id=\"7370797\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 575</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=22393\">Garmr</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7364632#p7364632\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7364632#p7364632\" data-post-id=\"7364632\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 555</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=25846\">Syndesis</a> wrote:</cite>N<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">A Brief Compilation of Thoughts About People</div><br>\n<br>\nI genuinely believe Garmr believes what he's saying and thus the tiff with Davsto is not a good reason to scumread him.

If you're using maths to justify a position, it means that you don't have the reads, or that you don't want to show the reads, or you're trying to make objective a game based on totally subjective reads and opinions and views. It's not incorrect, but it's not playing to the spirit or the most effective parts of the game. If you were to decide whether or not to lynch based on what the percentages of lynching scum were, you'd never lynch&#8212;you're always more likely to lynch town than scum.<br>\n<br>\nYes, it's true that there was a one in four chance to hit scum. That's assuming we're all completely random lynch-bots, though. The town isn't a herd of random lynch-bots, they're a thinking and reasoning mass, which is why it's possible for skill to exist in this game in the first place.

I don't think maths has much correlation with mafia.<br>\nThat doesn't mean I can't make a point which slightly uses it.<br>\nBasically, if Garmr was a random lynchbot he could get scum 25% of the time- which means that his claim to be good at the scumhuntings has little relevance.

I feel confident in Garmr, ICE, Wanderer, and yourself in terms of town-ness, due to general town play. I also think that All Alone's play feels very pro-town, but I mention him separately since a tiny voice in my head is telling me to be more suspicious of him. Can't quite place why at this instant, it just kind of feels like he's... purposefully emphasizing his townie-ness, and that feels scummy? I dunno. I still think he's town, though, just a little quibble in my brain-box. Syn is confirmed town.<br>\n<br>\nThat leaves Scorp, 3dice, Mario, and Pistach. I'm at least ninety percent certain that . The way 3dice is playing reminds me of how I play when scum, but it isn't in itself against town, it's just vaguely percolating suspicion at this point. Then we're down to Mario and Pistach and between the two, I feel like Mario's the less scummy of the two. Not by much, mind you&#8212;it's a close race in my opinion, but I think that Mario's reaction to pressure is more of a town response than not. Defends the points directly addressed to him, and continues pressing his lynch against the person he thinks is scum (Scorpius). Pistach, on the the other hand, has remained elusive, and her wagon-ish vote on Mario to bring him to L-1 doesn't speak positively to me.", "time": "Thu Nov 12, 2015 2:50 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=63842&start=675", "forum": "53", "thread": "63842"}

I'm three nines of certain that ICE is town at this stage, and confident saying All Alone is town. Scorp was just so much of a better lynch for town that it would have been for scum, and there was plenty of time for scum to subtly weave good PR for their buddy rather than bus him.

On top of that, she tries to involve herself with Davsto, but avoids casting suspicion on him. She admits to his failings, (\"his case and vote on ICE were bad\") but is not committed to a stance and generally defends him (\"But I don't really see much issues with his vote on Archmage because Archmage did hold his vote for a while. Just that he voted ICE on page 1 stuff without analysis of later posts makes him look bad enough. In my experience Davsto is always hard to read and looking a little scummy. I agree he needs to start posting content, I do think that if he's scum he would maybe try harder to make reads to prevent getting lynched and I don't see him doing that.\"). Lots of this sort of behavior where she kinda-sorta sides with Davsto, but is always noncommital. Quote is from her ISO post #7.<br>\n<br>\nThis is her only real mention of Davsto before he's lynched, aside from her ISO post #18, where she says \"I'll go read Davsto's iso because lately I've kind of been ignoring him (well, not ignoring him but brushed his posts aside as a VI-thing) but looking at how far we actually got with discussion I think Davsto is really lagging behind in terms of scumhunting, or at least trying to.\"<br>\n<br>\nAll other mentions of Davsto in Day 1 are in passing, or in relation to someone else's behavior.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">2.

She wants Scorp active, badly, which makes sense from the perspective of a scum-buddy. Her implicit suggestion that Pistach should \"commit\" to a position when Pistach seemed to think more town of Scorp than not also is suspect. Also don't like the further implicit suggestion that Pistach is scummy based on having reservations on a single read on Day 2. Seems aggressive, like she's trying to scare Pistach.<br>\n<br>\n\"If Mario and Scorpious were the only choices today, I would currently rather go for Mario over Scorpious.

A town death is detrimental to town, a scum death is detrimental to scum, and more importantly, dying means you can't play. <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Every</div> player should be scared of being killed. Furthermore, she's setting up a system where she suspects Scorpius and Mario, but just happens to like Mario for lynch a little bit more.

But he has been responding to other things so he is reading. I don't believe he missed multiple posts from several players asking him to elaborate on some of his reads. He's also not doing much to move discussion forward, feels like he's just waiting for someone to hammer Mario now. <br>\nMy read on Mario hasn't changed, however, and I still barely see him do anyything.

I don't like that one bit: town or scum would have justified the hammer, because town would feel that the hammer was justified, while scum would want to justify it. Then, wraps that in reasons that she \"suspects\" Scorpius, before adding that she still supported the Mario lynch more. Smells like something there for safety, so that it looks less like she's trying to deflect suspicion from Scorpius onto Mario.

Her insistence on getting Scorpius to try and answer questions seems like something that scum would not be obligated to do.

I have no better explanation for 801, and after some more thought about Scorpious' claim I decided to drop it because it's outguessing the mod. It's null.

Her insistence on getting Scorpius to try and answer questions seems like something that scum would not be obligated to do. I can see upsides and downsides to it as scum, but it just doesn't seem like something scum should be encouraged to do, if we act on the assumption that Wanderer and Scorp are scum-buddies.</div></blockquote><br>\nWhat happens to this thought if Scorpious flips town? <br>\n<br>\nFor the record, I'm townreading Archmage now.

I have no better explanation for 801, and after some more thought about Scorpious' claim I decided to drop it because it's outguessing the mod. It's null. The wiki-page says most commuters are even/odd-night or x-shot, but a full commuter is still considered normal, so it is possible though unlikely.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>6. *Ignores the reasoning behind unvoting Scorpius to less than L-1 and votes Scorpius back up to L-1*</div></blockquote><br>\nYes, that happened. I made a mistake and I unvoted again.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>My one reservation:<br>\n<br>\nWanderer's insistence on getting Scorp to answer questions about his reads on Day 2 could just be a scum trying to mentor their scum-mate along, but it is still a generally pro-town thing to try and get people to answer questions. Her insistence on getting Scorpius to try and answer questions seems like something that scum would not be obligated to do. I can see upsides and downsides to it as scum, but it just doesn't seem like something scum should be encouraged to do, if we act on the assumption that Wanderer and Scorp are scum-buddies.</div></blockquote><br>\nWhat happens to this thought if Scorpious flips town? <br>\n<br>\nFor the record, I'm townreading Archmage now. I think he put a lot of effort in his case on me and I didn't get the feeling he was trying to make me look bad, he just misinterpreted some things which also have to do with how I post when I'm in a bad mood. I'm sorry, it's a female-thing..</div></blockquote></div></div></div><br>\n<br>\nSummary: I like this response from Wanderer. My gut says it's a town response, but I don't trust my gut.<br>\n<br>\nThe Specifics: I especially like Wanderer's retort to point 4. It's consistent with her original provided reason for hammering rather than trying to drag up a new excuse from the ether. I also like 1 and 6. Scum likes to look more useful than not, being willing to admit mistakes and inconsistencies is, I think, a town behavior. 5 was a weak point anyways, more of a token mention than an actual reason for suspicion.<br>\n<br>\nPoint 2's response gives me reservations. It's making an excuse, rather than just saying yes/no like the other bits. Wanderer asks a question (what I think of her Day 2 and 3 posts about Scorpius) that is already answered in my post. I'm not sure if that means she was writing the post as she read, but it feels like an unnecessary question. The whole bit where \"The only stupid question is the one you already know the answer to\" bit. I always thought that saying was stupid, but I wonder why Wanderer felt the need to ask that there.<br>\n<br>\nHer response to post number three doesn't make her lean more town or more scum for me. Feels kind of neutral. On one hand, reasoning for liking Mario is solid enough. Personal experience is a good justification for making a move on someone that I don't understand. On the other hand, the response feels very confrontational. Which is a neutral action in of itself, so it really shouldn't make me feel more like she's scum.<br>\n<br>\nAll in all, this post has made me monumentally less sure in Wanderer being scum. I'd say... around seventy-five percent confident that she's scum if Scorpius flips scum. Around thirty percent confident if Scorp flips town. Time for me to examine someone else.<br>\n<br>\nSpecific Responses to Wanderer:<br>\n<br>\n\"What do you think of my posts about (and to) Scorpious Day 2 and today?\"<br>\nA: That's kind of answered in the rest of my post. I hope you won't begrudge me for not providing more details.<br>\n<br>\n\"So what exactly is wishy-washy and why does that make me scum? And similar to what?\"<br>\nA: \"Wishy-washy\" meant that I felt like your interactions with Scorpius weren't entirely ordinary, similar to your interactions with Davsto. It felt like you were always suspecting Scorpius, but just a <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">little bit</div> less than you suspected Mario. As scum, that'd be a strong interaction: if Scorpius got lynched instead, you had a good deal of negative interaction between you to say that \"I wasn't on his side, see? I wanted him lynched.\" Yet at the same time, it felt like you were kind of discouraging Scorpius as a lynch. I'd call your interactions with Scorpius \"wishy-washy,\" because it seems like it could be simultaneously true that you suspected him, but also that you wanted him not to be lynched as a more-or-less primary goal.<br>\n<br>\n\"Wanting Scorpious active: Ofcourse I want him active, if he's town he needs to help us find scum and if he's scum we want to catch him in a lie/contradiction and for that he needs to post.\"<br>\nR: Of course! ...it's just that you seemed slightly more interested in Scorpius' inactivity than the inactivity of other people. Is that a fair assessment?<br>\n<br>\n\"What happens to this thought if Scorpious flips town?\"<br>\nA: My \"one reservation\" becomes pretty big townie-points in your favor. A lot of my case is based off of the assumption that Scorpius is scum, since that seemed a pretty reasonable assumption. If Scorpius flips not-scum, you become a weak town-read for me. If Scorpius flips scum, you become for me \"probably scum.\" (Note that you've made progress with this post of yours: if Scorp flipped scum, I would have called you certainly scum, before.)<br>\n<br>\n<div align=\"center\"><hr style=\"height:14px;width:50%\"></div><br>\n<br>\nNext player I'm going to go real in-depth on is probably Pistach or ICE, the former to see if my suspicions on them are justified, and the latter to see if there's anything I've missed when town-reading him. I trust ICE a lot, and that makes me uncomfortable.<br>\n<br>\nI'd also like to vaguely note that <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">All Alone is dangerous scum.</div><br>\n<br>\nThat's not to say that All Alone is scum. I don't think that he is. However, I think that at this point All Alone has enough of a chance of being scum for me to consider the possibility, but has a small enough amount of information on him in this game and town-y enough play that if he were scum, he would have a fair shot of winning the game. I think that I'll probably go check out some of his other games to see if I can catch some meta-reads on him.", "time": "Mon Nov 23, 2015 4:59 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=63842&start=900", "forum": "53", "thread": "63842"}

In my experience, vanilla town try to avoid making long-term plans, because in their dearth of information, if they make a plan with any assumptions, they run the risk of every one of those assumptions being wrong. As such, only scum and town members who can gather information set long-term plans, because they're the only ones who can confirm their assumptions or act on non-assumed knowledge. I first began suspecting that ICE was cop (or at least, pro-town information gathering role) here:<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: Big quote</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\"><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7342812#p7342812\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7342812#p7342812\" data-post-id=\"7342812\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 230</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=12670\">ICEninja</a> wrote:</cite><br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Archmage wrote:</cite><br>\nLet's go over the possibilities:<br>\n1.

I criticized him on this, and in this post he basically says \"shut up nerd, I'm planning something.\" I picked up the hint, and dropped the topic as quickly as it was natural to do so. The reason why I thought he was town rather than scum is that if scum is laying a long-term plan, they don't want to be hinting anyone about what's going on, and those long-term plans are more likely to involve other scum-members. Since this plan began on day one, I deemed it very unlikely that ICE was scum.<br>\n<br>\nThe goal of ICE's \"plan\" was that he wanted to set me up as an \"easy lynch,\" so that scum would wagon onto me.

Because every game has the easy lynchbait, that (4 out of 5 times) townie who is trying but doesn't really have the best grasp of scum hunting, and scum vote them. A lot. It's easy to justify, gets D1 over without as much information going through, and it has come as no surprise to myself that the two most suspicious players FMPOV (Scorp and obviously Davsto) have made absolutely horrible awful Scummy McScumcum votes on Archmage.<br>\n<br>\nI had plans to do more with this earlier, but people didn't quite wagon him as hard as I thought they would.<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Syndesis wrote:</cite><br>\nI wish I could articulate this better, but if Davsto's baseline level of scumminess is always high then you have to recalibrate your reads, right? <br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\nI totally get what you're saying here, and my response is that useless/bad at D1 does not equal scummy. He has done things that are outright scummy.<br>\n<br>\nSo for the record, my lynch preference is Davsto, and I don't really want to move my vote, but for cookies I might be willing to hammer Scorpious if he gets run up to L-1.<br>\n<br>\n--------<br>\n<br>\nIt's page 20, I'm solid on my reads, and I think most people are as well. It's time to lynch. If your vote isn't on a major wagon, then reconsider.</div></blockquote></div></div></div><br>\n<br>\nThis was my next little clue: since this plan didn't benefit scum at all, and was designed with the explicit purpose of exposing scum, it made a lot more sense for him to be town rather than scum, but it also made assumptions and conclusions along the lines of scum versus not scum. It made the assumption of me being not-scum (a fair assumption, since it's the game's start), and ends with the idea that if the assumption is true, there is likely scum in the set of people who wagoned me. His end conclusion was that Davsto and Scorp were likely scum, or at least possibly scum, and he probably felt more comfortable with that gambit since he had the knowledge that he could use the results of it to inform a night action rather than a lynch (investigate Scorpius), or test the assumption itself (investigate me).<br>\n<br>\nI don't think he investigated me, though. He didn't put me in his \"will not vote for\" category, so unless he's playing the \"cast slight suspicion on the people you think are town so that the scum is likely to lynch them\" gambit (which seems like too silly of a gambit for ICE to use), I don't think that ICE investigated me. And to be fair, the assumption that I was town was a pretty strong one, especially considering that Davsto was in my wagon (meaning that in his eyes, his plan had already partly paid off), so he likely directed his investigation elsewhere.<br>\n<br>\nI don't think you can say with any degree of certainty that ICE investigated All Alone and Pistach. I do think that it is likely that at least one of the two was investigated by ICE, and it is well possible that he visited both. However, I think it is a significantly important note to make that ICE very well could have investigated Scorpius. Hm... actually, in review of that thought, I'm not sure if I agree with it in myself. I don't think it's possible to get a \"null result\" when visiting scum, can you? If scum is investigation proof, it usually means they read as town, which means that if ICE got a null result, he'd probably read Scorp as town, unless the null result had no flavor in which case he'd read it as having been role-blocked.<br>\n<br>\nUgh. Nevermind that logic. I don't think we can possibly conclude whether or not ICE investigated Scorpius unless we know how much flavor ICE did or didn't get. It made a lot of sense to me that ICE might have visited Scorpius on Night One: He had just been right in his read on Davsto, and Scorpius was his second scumread at that point (IIRC), so I don't doubt that he'd check Scorpius. However, AA and pistach were also good choices to make as a cop (they feel very uncertain, IMO, and alleviating that feeling as a Cop is a big weight off shoulders), and the \"VI\" comment seems like a very blatant tip to future town of \"Hey, this is who I investigated.\" Maybe he left a similar clue for his other night?<br>\n<br>\nICE seems careful and sneaky, the type who'd be fond of using innuendo. He sneaky-talked to me about his little chicanery on Day One, and the \"VI\" post seems like a bit of a clue to say \"Hey Pistach is town,\" so... I'm sure there's a \"hint hint I investigated this person\" somewhere in his ISO for the other person he investigated, but I have to go now, so I'll look through it later.<br>\n<br>\nI dunno, I need to speculate on this while I'm not full of ham, turkey, and pie. The Scorpius possibility for his investigation is interesting to consider, but it does seem likely that of all possible targets, pistach is probably the one we can say with a high degree of certainty was investigated by ICE.", "time": "Thu Nov 26, 2015 3:08 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=63842&start=950", "forum": "53", "thread": "63842"}

Just knowing that there's a chance 2 commuters could be in the game is why I'm confident in the scum having a Day Kill of some kind, and the fact I could have also have become a second Cop makes the setup as we know it very Town-sided, which pretty much guarantees scum have some strong powers.<br>\n<br>\nP-edit: Hmm, a Godfather is a strong possibility for this game.

Universal Backup.<br>\n<br>\nWith the number of power roles? This is <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">highly</div> unlikely unless Wanderer is scum, in which case, it's only very unlikely. This is a universal backup who can become: Innocent Child, Commuter, Cop, and (if Wanderer is town) 1-shot neighborizer. This would bring the Neighborhood from 2 to 3, with 4 total people having been in the neighborhood in the course of the game.<br>\n<br>\nI don't buy a Universal Backup in this game. It just seems way too ridiculously powerful.<br>\n<br>\n2. The Setup.<br>\n<br>\nEmphasis in the beginning is on 'today could be Mislynch or Lose.' The setup begins with a crisis, something to grab attention and lend credence to the rest of the post. More to the point, the existence of the crisis is his reason for claiming.<br>\n<br>\nThe thing is, the existence of the crisis is justified by his claim: \"Just knowing that there's a chance 2 commuters could be in the game is why I'm confident in the scum having a Day Kill of some kind,\" but presenting the MyLo possibility before the reasoning that read to it just doesn't feel Town to me. It's like he's emphasizing the presentation over the content, and by having something in front of his claim, it avoids emphasizing the weight of the claim itself.<br>\n<br>\n3. The Play<br>\n<br>\nAlchemist could have communicated this message without claiming. He could have said, \"with a Commuter in the game, it's fairly likely that scum has a daykill, therefor we ought to consider today Mislynch or Lose.\"<br>\n<br>\nThe reason that this is important is that someone who has just inherited a commuter role <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">does not want scum to know that they have a commuter role.</div> They desperately, desperately want scum to target them during the night, so that they can use their ability to prolong the game for the town. If they are legitimately town, then scum has no reason to doubt that they've become a commuter, so they will not target him during the night.<br>\n<br>\nBut Alch claimed anyways, which means that he's not operating by the same priorities and goals as a town commuter, and that his overall goal has nothing to do with being targeted during the night. Id est, he is lying and is not a commuter, and therefor not a Universal Backup.<br>\n<br>\n4. The Message.<br>\n<br>\nAlchemist is trying to make the point here that today is Mislynch or Lose (or rather, likely is).<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">However, his play contradicts this position.</div><br>\n<br>\nIf today is Mislynch or Lose, and he well and truly believed it, and he was Town, then he would not have <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">voted for Wanderer</div>. Assuming the meta is the same here as it is in other places I've played when it comes to MyLo, that is: because last I checked, a No-lynch is favorable for Town on MyLo, so that Town can reduce the number of suspects in play by allowing the mafia to kill a town member. Either Alchemist doesn't truly believe his own argumentation, or he's playing against town on purpose.<br>\n<br>\n<div align=\"center\"><hr style=\"height:14px;width:50%\"></div><br>\n<br>\nApologies if I've reiterated anyone's points.

The gambit is to combine a claim that town can't confirm with a degree of speculation to manufacture the crisis of Mislynch or lose. In theory, noticing this gives you towncred and power to drive the lynch. From scum perspective, if they actually have a Dayvig, then you have the power to drive a mislynch and win the game, quickly. I just think you might have botched the implementation.<br>\n<br>\nMore to this point, that sort of defense is a misdirection from the core of my argument, not being that scum would do the things that you did, but that town wouldn't.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7436543#p7436543\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7436543#p7436543\" data-post-id=\"7436543\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 1003</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=24636\">Alchemist21</a> wrote:</cite>And again, did you look into 3dice at all since you said you would?

I feel their Day 1 jump on Davsto's wagon looks like they needed to do it to prevent being scumread for not being on the wagon. There was no opinion on Davsto from All Alone all Day until near DL when All Alone suddenly wants to reach a concensus and joins on Davsto. (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7363082#p7363082\">495</a>) Which is funny, because Day 2 when Mario is the bigger wagon, they go for Scorpious instead, right after Pistachion went for Mario. (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7381932#p7381932\">674</a>) That gave me the idea that All Alone was looking more to not be on the same wagon as Pistachion so they could continue their tunnel the next Day again. Day 3 there's a weak jump back to Archmage for 'wanting to vote Scorpious but not yet voting' which was actually consistent playing from Archmage, so that read felt very out of place (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7397682#p7397682\">767</a>). Then decides to jump the Scorpious-wagon again but there isn't much reason, only that they may have jumped the gun on the previous Archmage-read. Now today they're voting for me and brings up points that were already relevant before Scorpious was lynched, which makes me think they wanted the Scorpious-misslynch to happen instead of coming up with a new case that might break the Day open again completely. <br>\n<br>\nI think I want All Alone and Pistachion to claim after all although I'm not sure if it is much use (scum would likely just claim vt at this point?) but it's bothering me that some people are treating them as conftown while those are basically assumptions. I need more than a possible cop-inno to be convinced All Alone is town. Also, the possibility of a godfather makes the results irreliable, so while I do believe ICE had an inno on Pistachion, I'm not treating it as a 100% clear.

Could be scum hesitating to be on the wagon of a town PR.<br>\n<br>\nNext, I looked at the ISOs.<br>\n<br>\n@Alchemist's - It's interesting to note that his first reads post includes davsto as a possibility of scum and archmage as a solid scumread. It was a very weak read on davsto that continues to be weak throughout the day 1 and that could be indicative. Alch also pursues a heavy scumread on archmage day 1, which offputs alch/archmage scum team, but then it seems like alch pretty much drops his arch reads, which points stronger to alch/archmage scum team. Day 2 he pushes for a mario lynch, which I was strongly dissatisfied with and day 3 he pushes for a scorpious lynch, which I believed was reasonable. <br>\n<br>\nI maintained a slight townread on alchemist throughout the game, and I initially believed his claim, but I began to have doubts when I thought more about the setup. If there was really a town universal backup in this game, that would mean that the game was open to the possibility of an IC, a cop (which is already pushing it with amount of cleared players), and then the possibility of ANOTHER cop. This is what leads me to doubt alchemist's claim as town. Not having a revealed doc does offset me about the setup, but if the scum roles aren't very powerful, then we might not necessarily have a doc or one of the unclaimed players is a weaker doc. <br>\n<br>\nOne thought that popped up in my mind: alchemist could actually be universal backup. If the scum have one useful role, alchemist could be a scum universal backup who can get that role, but I feel like with the limited number of town PRs in the setup, this thought could be premature.<br>\n<br>\n@Wanderer's - Day 1, I felt like Wanderer was kind of distanced from the game. She talked some, but I felt she was pretty aloof and not engaging. Interesting to note she vote parked archmage all day long. Her play was more engaging day 2 and 3, she engaged more with me and other players, so I began to townread her past then. It does bothers me that throughout the whole game it seems like she only votes for the most popular wagon, except the davsto wagon. <br>\n<br>\nAs for Wanderer's claim, I feel like 1-shot neighborizer isn't very powerful of a scum role, and it is only slightly more powerful as a town role. What really offsets me is her neighborizing target. I'm confused why she would target syndesis, the confirmed town. I mean, theoretically, she could not be influenced by her, and they could have good discussion of reads, which would be a positive, but ultimately, I feel like it would've been more useful as town to neighborize an unknown player in an attempt to get a better read on them.<br>\n<br>\n@Archmage's - Day 1, I felt that archmage was really town in regards to gut, but examining how he treats the davsto wagon, I'm kind of disarrayed. He implies heavy suspicion on davsto, but waits until two votes were on him before voting. He later retracts his vote (possibly in hopes his buddy won't get lynched?) and then once davsto's wagon shows no sign of slowing down, archmage hops on. Other than this, I felt like Archmage was pretty town the rest of the game, except for one extra thing. He attracted a lot of attention as a potential day 1 wagon; however, his wagon got a lot of resistance. I'm not sure if that's scum resistance that kept him from being viewed or townieness, but I'm leaning more on townieness. <br>\n<br>\nAs for archmage's role, VT is a common claim for scum and town alike, but I feel like VT does fit more within the setup. It's not really alignment indicative though.<br>\n<br>\nThe VCA's point me to Archmage, but the ISO's point me the alchemist and wanderer, and the claims point me to alchemist and wanderer, so at this point in the game, I feel most confident alchemist is scum, followed by wanderer, then archmage. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">However</div>, in one of my recent games that was just finished, I felt duped by the endgame because a player I wasn't expecting ended up flipping scum.

It is true that the vote was the first time AA have an opinion on Dave, but at the same time he switched from a wagon (on what we now know is Cop-investigated Town) that he could have tried to get more support for.  He could have still given an opinion on Davsto then asked for a compromise onto Pistachion, feeling stronger about them.  I think that he switched to a scum wagon when the wagons were so divided makes him more likely Town in this case.  <br>\n<br>\nI can see a Town player voting for Scorpious for the reason AA did.  Saying he voted there because Pistachion voted Mario and he wanted to fuel a tunnel on Pistachion seems like tinfoil or BS to me.  <br>\n<br>\nThe vote onto Archmage is a strange hiccup in AA's play.  Given everything else and that he retracted it in his next post I'm inclined to think this was a case of actual derp on his part.  <br>\n<br>\nSaying there was no reason for the following switch back onto Scorpious is plainly BS since the reasons were already given the first time he voted Scorpious. It makes perfect sense that his vote goes back there after retracting on Archmage.<br>\n<br>\nLastly, you say AA's reason for voting you was valid before the Scorpious lynch but I don't think that's entirely true.  First, there's the point that you put him to L-1 despite a concern that he would selfhammer, and that you only did so because you knew that Scorpious was Town and wouldn't selfhammer.  This argument stems from the fact that Scorpious was Town, a fact which would not have been known to Town before the lynch. I will admit the second reason was valid before the lynch, that you had not provided an alternative.  I think this wasn't pointed out then because AA himself thought Scorpious was scum and was more focused on him than you. You yourself said that you believe he wanted a lynch to happen, but with the implication that AA knew this was wrong which I don't think is true.  <br>\n<br>\nI was starting to think Wanderer was Town, but looking closer at this case on AA makes me think they're trying to doubtcast the Cop result on AA.  <br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Wanderer</span>", "time": "Fri Dec 04, 2015 7:58 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=63842&start=1025", "forum": "53", "thread": "63842"}

But that only makes sense if you know that scum can talk about it amongst themselves, since otherwise scum would have no more awareness of the IC than town. Yet 3dice asks if scum get pregame chat.

I was called him out about his avoiding the game. As scum, there's no motivation for me to call my mate out on active-lurking at that point, and no reason for me to draw attention to him, I'd want to keep quiet about anything fishy that my buddies are doing that isn't obvious.

Scum had a definite motivation to keep Scorpius alive at that point, as he was easily the most fishy suspicious player at the time, and was likely to (and, did, to a degree) divert the Day 3 lynch away from further investigation. I predict that scum would be on the wagon opposing Scorpius, which was Mario. Unfortunately, this does not eliminate either of you from my scum pool.<br>\n<br>\nI think I've decided. pistachi0n is scum, 3dice is town. I'm still too beat to list all the quotes, but the gist of my case for this is...<br>\n<br>\n1. 3dice supported Davsto lynch on Day 1 from early on. He does have a scummy vote position (I'm told L-1 is fairly scummy), but it's a teammate nonetheless. 3dice doesn't strike me as the sort to call out against his teammate starting from Day 1.<br>\n<br>\n2. pistach defended both Davsto and Wanderer.

{"number": 1101, "id": "7487142", "user": "3dicerolling", "user_id": "23225", "content": "Pistacion day 1 - She throws around some questions. Immediately discredits the possible townslip of archmage. Vote on mario with hypocritical reasoning. Interesting vote on archmage. What looks like chainsaw defense of davsto. Scum reads all-alone because she is being hypocritical about how pistacion is doing nothing, which is odd because they were both slacking day 1. <br>\n<br>\nDay 1 pistacion has no interaction with davsto at all and very little interaction with wanderer. <br>\n<br>\nPistacion day 2 - Immediately sheeps alchemist on all alone, which lines up with her ideals of the previous day. Leaves a null read on scorpious. Sheeps alchemist again to vote for mario, who frankly wasn't even that scummy and was being voted for reasons similar to why pistacion was scummy. <br>\n<br>\nNot very much activity, but there was some interaction with wanderer here, albeit, seeming a bit forced. Lot's of sheeping and not a lot of strong stances. <br>\n<br>\nPistacion day 3 - Opens up answering syndesis's question, stating that scum wouldn't have a particular distribution across the two wagons, which is odd because that's usually something scum focus on. Not much else happens except she immediately doubts scorpious's claim, which most players did. <br>\n<br>\nPistacion day 4 - Comes out of the gate doubting alchemist's role. Seems very odd considering alchemist has been pistacion's <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">strongest</div> townread throughout the entire game. She throws in some statements that basically leaves her at null about the claim. Looks like not wanting to take a stance. <br>\n<br>\nPistacion day 5 - Pushes my lynch this day, which if that would have happened would have ended the game. Just seems peculiar to me that she could think wanderer is scummy, yet want to pursue me more that day. Maybe scum wanting to win the game that day?<br>\n<br>\nPistacion day 6 - Very odd behavior. She doesn't seem very committed to finding out who the last scum is, but more of swaying between archmage and I. <br>\n<br>\nArchmage day 1 - Very early reads list out. Intrigues me because I don't usually see scum throw out reads that quickly, even if they weren't very strong. Decent amount of interaction with wanderer and an early scumread on davsto. A little bit more interaction with players then an awkward unvote on davsto. He revotes davsto later.<br>\n<br>\nThere is a good bit of interaction with wanderer and archmage, which is more of a good sign I'd say. <br>\n<br>\nArchmage day 2 - A lot of focus on scorpious lynch. He does not really say much about mario. At that point, I thought the scorpious lynch was better then the mario lynch. I thought the mario lynch was terrible. <br>\n<br>\nArchmage day 3 - Most of the day is archmage back and forth with wanderer. He made a case for wanderer scum. Afterwards, he admits that All Alone would be dangerous as scum. <br>\n<br>\nArchmage day 4 - The first part is him spending debating Ice's cop play and who he may have copped. He puts an either or on wanderer and alchemist, which I could relate to at that point in the game. The only odd thing I find about this day is that wanderer hammered soon after archmage placed his vote and response to my post, which could have been to cut off discussion; however, this could also be the case with a scum pistacion. <br>\n<br>\nArchmage day 5 - He is very open about who the scum might be this day. Doesn't end up voting wanderer, but might have if she had not self hammered. <br>\n<br>\nArchmage day 6 - This is where things really got interesting. I figured that if archmage was scum, he would immediately go after me this day. After all, pistacion was ready to vote me over wanderer the previous game day, so all archmage scum would have to do is go after me this day and he would have won, but instead he takes a very conservative approach to the day, which I see coming from a town archmage. <br>\n<br>\nOverall - Pistacion has some good play day 1, but many of her votes are bandwagon or hypocritical for the rest of the game. She plays most of the game hanging in the shadows it seems, with only giving a few reads at a time. Archmage is a lot more open with reads. His day 1 play was okay, but his play the following days reflect town to me. I'm leaning pistacion right now, but I need to 100% sure before I vote. <br>\n<br>\n@Pistacion -<br>\n<br>\n1. Why have you been reserved when giving out reads this game?<br>\n<br>\n2. Why do you think archmage would open this game very open about who his reads if he was scum?<br>\n<br>\n3. Why did your read on alchemist change so quickly?<br>\n<br>\n@Archmage - <br>\n<br>\n1. Do you think passive (pistacion's play) vs active (my play) is alignment indicative?
