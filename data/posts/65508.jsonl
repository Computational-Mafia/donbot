All sitewide rules apply. Do not break them.<br>2. Do not quote any PMs received from the moderator in thread. You may paraphrase.<br>3. Do not contact other players about the game outside the game thread. This includes PMs and off-site communications.<br>4. Play to your win condition. <br>5. Do not use tiny text, cryptography or anything along those lines.<br>6. Do not bring provable randomness into the game. This includes dice tags.<br>7. Keep it civil. Do not flame or personally attack other players. Attack the play, not the player.<br>8 Do not impersonate the moderator. <span style=\"color: #0040BF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">This is my color. Don't use it.</span></span><br>8. If you die you are allowed one \"Bah\" post. Do not include anything game related in your post.<br>9. Each day phase will last 14 days and each night phase will last 2 days.<br>10. Players who have not posted for 48 hours will receive a prod. After receiving a prod, a player has 24 hours to post before I will begin seeking a replacement. If a player receives three prods they will be replaced.<br>11. Players on V/LA will be exempt from the prod rules above.<br>12. Use vote tags or bold tags to place votes. As long as it can be reasonably interpeted as a vote I will accept it. Do not attempt to use this rule to engage in vote trickery. Examples of acceptable votes:<br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: SirCakez</span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: SirCakez</span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote:</span> SirCakez<br>13. Players may vote to end the phase without a lynch. Do this by voting for a nolynch (see below)<br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: No Lynch</span><br>14. When a player has reached a majority of votes, that player will be lynched and the phase will end.<br>15. Players may post after a majority has been reached until I announce the end of the phase.<br>16. At least one player will receive this role (see below)<br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Welcome to Mini Normal 1769, (player name)!<br><br>You are a <span style=\"color: #008000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Vanilla Townie</span></span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Abilities</span></span><br>-During the day, you may vote for whoever you want lynched.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Win Condition</span></span><br>You win when all threats to the town are eliminated and at least one town-aligned player is alive, or nothing can prevent the same.<br><br>The game thread is here: <!-- l --><a class=\"postlink-local\" href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=65508\">viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=65508</a><!-- l --></div></blockquote>"}

On the one hand, I don't really understand the basis for Golden's reads. I don't see you prodding mn over his playstyle as scummy - it seemed like it had the same idea behind it (to get the game rolling and to get the measure of mn) as when I did it. While I wouldn't say I get any strong townread out of it I certainly wouldn't push back against somebody townreading you in the way that Golden has. I'm not sure where the Masquerade townread is coming from, either, and despite some fairly obvious opportunities to do so before I asked Golden hasn't explained it. <br><br>The scumread on Ocean is partially based on disagreement over those reads and I think partially based on Ocean not answering Golden's questions immediately - considering Ocean wasn't really dodging but instead pushing on an apparent inconsistency in Golden's reads (and chasing that would be more useful for Ocean before giving his own reads, rather than after) I don't think that that was scummy myself.<br><br>On the other hand, Golden's pushing is putting alignment-relevant stuff in the thread, which is good at this stage. I like <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7705003#p7705003\" class=\"postlink\">#78</a> as a means of \"pushing\" the OceanWind discussion. <br><br>tl;dr: I don't like the reads that are being pushed but I do kinda like how it's being pushed.

Please come back soon. :3<br><br>At this point I have a pretty decent town read on Slandaar, mostly because he's been hitting points that are also on my mind as I'm reading the thread.  The Kain point in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7711492#p7711492\">Post 175</a> is a great example and the things he's bringing up in his conversation with Keyser are others (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7714305#p7714305\">Post 229</a>).  <br>I'm also townreading Aquanim, mostly from <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7707941#p7707941\">Post 101</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7711209#p7711209\">Post 161</a>.  His end of the conversation about Robster makes enough sense and I think it makes me more inclined to think he was actually initiating a conversation to double check a read he was iffy on.  <br>From the few data points out there, I think Oceanwind is more likely town than not because of <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7705124#p7705124\">Post 79</a>.  I can't say I agree with the Keyser townread, but the mn town read looks good and hit's the sweet spot in efficacy.<br><br>Even though I dislike most of what he's done in this game immensely, I think it's far more likely that Robster is town than not.  Even though the OceanWind read doesn't seem to be based on much, I have to think it's sincere (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7704902#p7704902\">Post 74</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7704925#p7704925\">Post 75</a>).  I hate the way he's approaching the Kain read.  Drawing the conclusion that Kain is a \"mislynch\" at 3 votes is just terrible.  I hate, hate, hate the way he's trying to marginalize me by glibly dismissing me as scum with this lazy and easily disproved argument that I bogarted Slandaar's case.<br><br>Keyser Soze is someone who I really wish would make <span style=\"font-style: italic\">less frequent</span>, better quality posts.  I'm not saying that to be mean, but the signal to noise ratio in that ISO is insane and that's why the read there is so elusive for me.  I keeping thinking it's more likely he's town but whenever I try to make myself happy with that read and move on I just can't because there's a shortage of strong, decisive, legitimate thoughts in his posts.<br><br>Now to Kain:  You can say whatever you want about personality, but I'm not voting him based on that.  I'm voting him because I think what he's doing is a lot more likely to help scum in their win condition than town in their win condition.  Specifically, I think he's saying things for the sole purpose of getting townread.  Saying that he's lynchbait is intellectually lazy and doesn't answer the fundamental question of if he drew a scum card <span style=\"font-style: italic\">in this game</span> or not.  Being a VI doesn't make them town all the time.  I don't even think the label \"VI\" even really accurately describes Kain because there are a few places in his posting that show calculation and capacity for guile.  If there's a place where anyone thinks he gives a legitimate read or town motivated post, I'm all ears, but don't just tell me about his personality because fuck you, that's irrelevant."}

Both scum and town can demonstrate a \"lack of commitment and conviction\" in a read. You do not scum read and lynch someone based on this - it is tactically naive and absurd. I would actually be more fearful of players who push a 'closed case' strong read of a player after a short/light catch-up.

I see overwhelming tells in his play that I usually associate with scum behaviour, but I personally attach alot of importance to WIFOM in my analysis. Therefore, the fact I can't see KainTepes possessing the scum-motivation to be lynched/investigated early forces me to null-read KainTepes. I attacked both KainTepes and mn as bad players (which I admit was anti-town) - but this was due to my frustration with their posts - they are not playing the way I want a townie to play."}

Take away his his tunnel on me, and his ISO is hollow.

Eh, maybe not, but it is as great as anything else out there, and is better than more than half of them. It is at least a valid statement that can be debated - is or isn't the slot scumhunting? You can at least look over posts and assess that.<br><br>The case Ircher raised on BBT (and that you apparently agree with) basically is a complaint that he did a whole thread review (something Ircher just did...so I'm not sure why that freaks him out) and then \"tunneled\" on Keyser. Since you seem to have issues with Kain and could be accussed of \"tunneling\" that slot, I am not sure why you find \"tunneling/focus\" to be a bad thing.

I may be a bad player, but I don't give a shit how long you've been on this site. You need to learn how to listen. That advice will serve you well. You are so up your own ass spouting wordy fluff it clouds your reasoning and logic. Do you actually read your own posts back? - they are comical. Spinning non-alignment indicative arguments, and instead of reasoning with players with conflicting opinions to your own, you basically call them dumb instead. I would actually suggest catching up before holding the ground of knowing everything. Even I will admit some slots have been hard to read.<br><br>No one is going to support your fucking anti-town force-to-L1/roleclaim plan. It doesn't matter if it was on me or someone else. It's not happening. We scum hunt here. You can wallpost more game-theory shite but take this advice from a relative beginner.... listen to other players. Who the fuck do you think you are miss-quoting my post and miss-repping my argument? Don't spunk your toxic/anti-town/stubborn attitude on this thread. <span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">You're making this game no fun to play.</span></span> Convince TellTaleHeart that I am scum, otherwise shut the fuck up with your \"it's-4-days-to-deadline-guys!-let's-get-a-roleclaim!\" fearmongering bullshit. I didn't sign up to this fucking game to roleclaim early and be misslynched within a few days. I detest your motives.<br><br>I shouldn't need to say all this, because you've probably played over a 100 games FFS. But seriously, sort your fucking attitude out, otherwise I'll need to replace out too. <span class=\"noboldsig\">You are making this game fucking unbearable</span>. If you disagree with my town reads tell me why. If you disagree with my scum reads tell me why. Like any other normal fucking townie would do. Get the fuck off that high horse. Moreover, explain your fucking town reads, FFS. I don't know what the fuck is going on in your head. This is a fucking team game, we need to catch scum TOGETHER. I can see you pushing wagons but with no scum-alignment indicative argument to support them. I'd usually wouldn't give a fuck if someone upholds their uber-agressive playstyle - but when you're forcing through anti-town play, you need to be shut the fuck down."}

You seem to think that tunneling = scum which is a thought that has absolutely no support from even a cursory review of previous mafia games on this (or any) site. Tunneling = anti-town. Tunneling is used by scum sometimes, but tunneling is often a result of town thinking they are right.

There is absolutely many pro-town benefits to being focused on a player you think is scum - because, well, there are pro-town benefits to lynching scum, and the way you lynch scum is to get people to vote them, and the way you get people to vote someone is that you talk about that person. Since his focus is your stated issue with him, already your scum vibe there falls immensely flat for me.<br><br>Conversely - go and read his interplay from the page I noted him as a town read, he is talking to TTH.

Keyser's made some long posts that didn't really go anywhere (e.g. <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7718350#p7718350\" class=\"postlink\">this stuff on mn</a>, <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7718008#p7718008\" class=\"postlink\">his list of reasons to lynch Kain</a>) but I've seen posts like that from him as town (e.g. <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7460793#p7460793\" class=\"postlink\">this</a>).<br>- I can't see any good reason why Keyser would flip as he did about Kain as scum. If Kain's his scumbuddy, Keyser's inviting a lot of pressure onto himself; if Kain is town, then what Keyser's done is far more conspicuous than simply riding an easy mislynch, or arguing against it in the first place.<br><br>It doesn't look like a Kain lynch is going to happen today, so:<br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: KainTepes</span><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: BlueBloodedToffee</span>"}

Unlike other tunnels, etc. conducted on Keyser, the BBT tunnel seems scum-motivated. A supplementary element of the case is the intense skimming/lack of reading that is being done by BBT.<br><br>Now, that was as unbiased as I can I sum it up. So, tell me, <span class=\"noboldsig\">Is there a whole bunch different to the main reason of both cases? I think not. So, why then is the Keyser wagon not equally as great as the BBT wagon?</span> That's a question from an unbiased perspective. From a biased stance, I'd say the BBT wagon is better supported by the facts.</span><br><br>5. Keyser is using AtE and possibly Appeal to Majority (?) in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7733562#p7733562\">749</a> - <span style=\"font-style: italic\">Not necessarily alignment indicative</span><br><br>6. <span style=\"font-style: italic\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">@Thor in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7733571#p7733571\">750</a>[b]- [b]<span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><span style=\"color: orange\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span style=\"font-size: 160%; line-height: 116%;\">Do us all a favor and stop acting like you are omnipotent and omnifiscent -- YOU AREN'T THE GOD OF MAFIA -- And, I am not the only one who feels this way. Keyser obviously does. I'm pretty sure Aqua is getting annoyed by you. As is prob. everyone else in this game.</span></span></span></span></span></span><br><br>7. Also <span style=\"font-style: italic\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">@Thor in regards to <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7733571#p7733571\">750</a> - <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><span style=\"font-size: 135%; line-height: 116%;\">According to the wiki, tunneling = Confirmation Bias. Whether that is alignment indicative by itself is not important, what is is the underlying motives. Again, just please stop like your a know-it-all &amp; everyone should play mafia YOUR way.</span></span></span></span><br><br>8. @GuyFawkes in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7734230#p7734230\">771</a> about the BBT case at least as good as the Keyser case - <span style=\"font-style: italic\">It's all about motive. I will be honest and admit that both cases have some major flaws that no one has really addressed. That's why the comparison is made, based on the objective material, both cases are fairly equal. It's when we add in bias that makes the diff. between my thoughts on BBT versus my thoughts on Keyser. Also, I have town meta with Keyser, so that also affects my view.</span><br><br>9. In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7734410#p7734410\">776</a>, BBT states \"Prodge\" (not a typo). - <span style=\"font-style: italic\">That literally sounds like Prod+Dodge combined. Whether it was intention, I'm not sure. But prod-dodging is def. anti-town and possibly scum-motivated.</span><br><br>10. <span style=\"font-style: italic\">Massive, you are making zero sense this game. Did you roll scum again, and since you know I am pretty easy to lynch early or pretty easy to lynch late, you're trying to use that to your advantage? What does a counterwagon have to do with my townread of Keyser? Also, you imply one thing in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7734554#p7734554\">777</a>: I don't strongly townread Keyser like I say I do. That is false. My townread has been consistent. Start reading and stop bring up reasons that have no logic or evidence behind them to lynch me.</span><br><br>11. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7734829#p7734829\">785</a> - BBT admits he's not reading my spoilered stuff and is solely basing his read of me on his thoughts of my predecessor - <span style=\"font-style: italic\">That alone could be a case against BBT -- I see zero town motivation in that post.</span></div></div></div><br><br>Yeah, still want the BBT lynch. Also like how Thor finally shut up -- he was acting as bad town."}

This reads to me like someone who knows who is town, and happy to jump on the best wagon. Usually you can see a townie putting together reads and conclusions through interactions and discussion with other players. Not here. It sounds like he already knows his conclusions and answers, and is arguing off that. Townies should fumble through a game, challenging their reads. Re-analysing, re-evaluating and questioning. GuyFawkes has been quiet, outside the nitty-gritty of scum-hunting, but somehow shows too much confidence on a read/lynch for a player who hasn't even shown the work of getting to those conclusions.<br><br>This is why GuyFawkes still sits in my uncomfortable pile.

I have learned that meta is actually pretty important when reading players... when I first came here, I was like \"Meta doesn't matter....\", but that's not true as everyone plays different. Also, the wa a player plays &amp; the way people respond to them tells a lot about their meta -- I haven't read a single game of another user, but I am able to discern the meta of a player fairly quickly. Some people would be harder to read meta-wise though.</span><br><br>4. Keyser does an ISO of BBT in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7730171#p7730171\">643</a> - <span style=\"font-style: italic\">I've already expressed that I felt BBT's push/\"case\" against Keyser was rather weak, opportunistic, and scum-motivated. This ISO reinforces such a read and also identifies a ton of holes in BBT's Keyser'=Scum case.</span><br><br>5. Addressing some points in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7730256#p7730256\">646</a> - <span style=\"font-style: italic\">1) Why is the thread review a problem - While I replaced in, and therefore, yesterday was my first opportunity to review the thread, BBT has been in the game since the start, yet by the sound of 1 of his posts, it seemed like he wasn't reading the thread at all. 2) I feel the tunnel by BBT is not only pathetic, but opportunistic and scum-motivated; BBT seems to be pushing a not-well supported, holey case on a slot that a lot of people express mild annoyance/scumreads of.</span><br><br>6. Keyser claims Thor is running people to L-1 without providing his own thoughts in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7730392#p7730392\">648</a>. Thor responds with <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7730438#p7730438\">649</a> with details on why some of the things Keyser said in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7730392#p7730392\">648</a> are untrue or inaccurate. - <span style=\"font-style: italic\">I actually like both for town. Keyser provides a pretty good post explaining his read of Thor, and actually supports it fairly decent. (Actually, it wasn't just the L-1 shenanigans that led to a scumread of Thor -- Masq played a role as does the fact that Thor almost immediately suggests it after replacing in. Thor then points out an inaccuracy in Keyser's post which I like cuz again, he is supporting his claim. In this case, I don't think Keyser was intentionally trying to misrep Thor by stating he didn't provide any thought, I think it has to do with tunnelling &amp; confirmaion bias between the two.</span><br><br>7.

Thor states he only encourages deadline lynches as scum in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7730838#p7730838\">664</a>. - <span style=\"font-style: italic\">I don't have a scum meta yet, but I'm the exact opposite! I actively encourage deadline lynches that way we get as much out of our time as possible.</span><br><br>10. <span style=\"font-style: italic\">Good, I'm not the only one who thinks <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7730857#p7730857\">668</a> about Keyser. Prove the fundamental argument that Keyser is empty posting, and I will seriously consider joining the wagon. Til then, I think I'm sticking to a BBT wagon.</span><br><br>11. @<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7731158#p7731158\">681</a> -- I'm OceanWind's replacement.

Show me where I haven't caught up; 5 pages I haven't read cuz of RL that sprung up in the last 24 hrs is def. not alignment-indicative.

Can you show me this so-called arrogance? Like, where I claimed only I was right? Or where I claimed I had the only correct way. I *do* tend to suggest that voting and pushing is the proper play, but even back in point #1 you're telling me that I have to give names and lists of reads - so you *are* aware that if you think a style of play is helpful for the town that you should try to get people to play that way...is that arrogance?

Csareo was basically in Keyser's position. BBT in guy's. Everyone in the game had been picking a side, it wasn't happening at all.

All three of them being scum seems too easy, though."}

I'll agree there is the ugly as hell wagon, sure, but your Guy case is potentially open ended, Keyser's reactions towards the wagon are also suspect, and the connections between Ircher and Slandaar, if you like them, are equally strong for Ircher and Keyser - plus we don't need to bother building a wagon for the Keyser lynch.<br><br>I'd rather lynch Keyser.<br><br>If it's a deadline or Ircher, you have me, and, frankly, if Keyser falls apart for Ircher you'll probably get me.

The best you have is the hardcore sheep/WKing of Keyser to my mind to suggest Ircher is scum and Keyser isn't - but I don't think that pans out with the expressed nervousness of wanting to distance in case Keyser flips scum - as I don't quite think Ircher would play that sort of gambit and also be giving me the newb vibes he's giving me."}

Should I ditch that read just cuz \"welp, its deadline &amp; the other guy got confirmed as towm\"?<br>2. You claimed that Guy was a Mason. I questioned the validity of the claim, as you have been spewing whatever you want this game. The fact that I asked two people ON THE OPPOSITE WAGON their views of the claim should tip you that I was questioning myself &amp; felt there could be some weight to your claim. Regardless of what I said then, it should be evident that there was some hesitation in what I said.<br>3. Okay, I'll describe it for you. In Micro 590, I was a Heroic Town Rolecop. One of my first posts in the game was a RVS vote about a fake dayvig shot. That guy, Fire Starter, jumps on me since we were apparently out of RVS. I apparently overreacted to him, and regardless of what I said from then til my lynch, they could not think of any possibility except I was scum who was flailing. Point being, flailing isn't always scum indicative. Esp. when it hardly counts as flailing as it did there and as it does now.<br>4. Metadive me. You implicitly stated an intent to hammer. I didn't want to lynch quite yet, and Guy was at L-1. I unvoted so other could respond. I revote the next day because I was pretty sure Guy was scum at that pooint and there didn't seem to be any point in waiting any longer.<br><br>Pedit - I dare you to metadive me."}

Ircher's play in 1755 made him an easy mislynch -- but you seem to be suggesting I should forgive obviously-scummy behavior because \"he's played like this before,\" when I would suggest that I would lynch anyone (and probably Ircher specifically A LOT) if they behaved in this fashion. I'm not going to give him a pass just because he plays scummy in every game.<br><br>---<br><br>Someone want to explain Titus to me? I'm not seeing it.</div></blockquote><br>Few things:<br><br>1. The strong defense of Keyser was genuine. Yet at the same time, I, knowing my meta, am quite well aware that I have a tendency to do stuff that make me an easy mislynch. Therefore, the \"distancing\" was there as a precaution, in the slim case that I was wrong.<br><br>2. I've done scummy stuff this game. Rolefishing is definitely one of them. Sometimes, I am not thinking about how things go through, though I admit that the rolefishing was a bit more intentional versus some stuff I've done in the past that has gotten me mislynched.<br><br>3. The only thing you've done this game is tunnel me. You didn't give your thoughts about Keyser D1, you never said anything about Thor D2, and you continue to insist on tunneling me when there are so many other people who you should also at least be giving some attention to. Your strategy -- Tunnel me until I'm lynched makes zero sense and does not help town because there are 3 mafia. It may be acceptable if there was 1 scum left, or we're searching for a SK, but tunneling me without giving the slightest attn to anyone else (What's your thoughts on Kein? Boon? Titus? (You say you townread him in the quoted post -- why?) Keyser?). I may be slightly misrepping you here -- maybe you have given some opinions on some other people besides me. But the core point persosts, you haven't tried to analyze anyone except me despite knowing there are multiple scum.<br><br>4. So in other words, you are saying that having a meta of being easily mislynched due to scummy actions means you are EVEN MORE likely to scumread a player for that. Again, I admit, some of the stuff I've done here have been blatantly poor/scummy, and while I intentionally did do some of it (Rolefishing, poor VCA), I had no intentions of manipulating / using my meta as a way to defend myself for those actions (let me clarify: I'm defending myself with meta, but I am also taking responsibility for my actions. Rather than just using my meta, I'm also admitting that my play in some ways deserves to be found scummy). Back to the original point -- Meta is not something you just trash. <span class=\"noboldsig\">Meta is important</span> A solely meta defense or meta scum-read is NOT what I mean by meta is important -- That fails as meta can be manipulated and is always changing. No, what I'm saying is that meta lays the foundation for how you read a player. Let me use you as an example: you have a meta of lurking. While lurking is generally scummy (antitown at least), it's not a very valid argument against you since you do it regardless of alignment. People therefore CANNOT base their read of you SOLELY on your activity as lurking is what you do as your playstyle. A person who has a tendency to do scummy stuff (as town) that gives them mislynched should mean that players should be more cautious in scumreading them. Yet, you imply that the opposite should be expected. Why? What's the point of having a meta if you ignore it / are held to an illogical standard that is the opposite of your meta?"}

BBT is hands-down the person I have played the most often with.

Also, what do you make of both Ircher and Aqua jumping to his defence?</div></blockquote><br>Ircher has been defending him all game, with absolutely zero reason to actually do so, including trying to fluff over anybody \"reading anything into it\" and magically calling Keyser v. Thor \"town vs town\" (<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7732665#p7732665\" class=\"postlink\">730</a>). His entire reason for \"97% confidence\" is \"I have seen nothing that isn't town-motivated from this slot.\" That's <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7729084#p7729084\" class=\"postlink\">611</a>. They aren't masons, or else Ircher would have contradicted Titus in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7743111#p7743111\" class=\"postlink\">1215</a>. (That's also where you can see he'd rather no-lynch than vote Keyser.) The worst part is that, beyond blanket statements saying \"Keyser is town,\" there's no further interaction. There's no sense of Ircher wanting to work with Keyser in terms of town bloc; there's just continued defense and no cause.<br><br>So here's my problem. I don't think Ircher-scum sticks his neck out like this for Keyser-scum. I think Ircher knows Keyser is town, starts defending him, and just goes full balls-to-the-wall trying for the towncred once Keyser gets flipped as town. <br><br>Aquanim's Keyser association seems to start as anti-Kain sentiment. \"The enemy of my enemy\" and such. But the interaction seems a little more two-way ... spots where Aquanim is trying to understand Keyser's thoughts, or trying to -- well, I don't want to say \"massage,\" but that's accurate -- massage Keyser's thoughts closer to his. It strays towards good town work (this isn't alignment-indicative, you're reading this wrong)."}

From something I wrote in my wiki a while back:<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Do not be afraid to mislynch. Do not feel too bad about misreading inactive and useless townies. You're far better off lynching a useless null than somebody who is maybe slightly more likely to flip scum, but who is active and will become more readable one way or the other with time. And if you encounter a townie who is making the thread toxic and unplayable... show no remorse. Just because they got handed a town PM doesn't mean they're helping you achieve the town wincon.<br><br>(That being said, lynching replacement-bait which has no interaction with any other slots is not ideal, though sometimes unavoidable.)<br><br>If you screwed up and lynched a useful townie out of paranoia or something, you should feel bad.</div></blockquote><br><br>There are (almost) always going to be some players in the game which are inherently difficult to read due to inactivity, lack of regard for their wincon, etc. If the playerlist has like six or so (which I've seen in the past), town is pretty much screwed unless you get lucky - since you can't afford to lynch all of them.<br><br>This game actually had less than most - of the players post-replacement I would put Titus, Guy and Massive approximately in this category. BBT had shades of it too. I'm not sure how to classify Kain. Boonskiies sometimes is but in this game, not. <br><br>The particularly important point is that <span class=\"noboldsig\">these players will not become much easier to read as the game continues</span>. Lynching a player like Keyser day 1 is inherently a bad plan because given a few days he will either get shot or his alignment will become obvious. Probably the same for me in the other direction this game - my play in later days was quite catchable in ways my d1 play was not.<br><br>On the other hand, lynching players who will never be particularly readable is preferable. I believe I would have lynched Masquerade/GuyFawkes d1 as town this game without hesitation. Similarly Titus' play deserved to die, even if it didn't flip scum. Town was unfortunate in that they went for the two that didn't have red PMs, but I think they were both lynches that had to happen sooner or later.<br><br>tl;dr: Activity is not alignment-indicative, but <span class=\"noboldsig\">nevertheless activity should influence who you choose to lynch</span>. Your current read on a slot is NOT the only think which should influence your choice of lynch."}
