All sitewide rules apply. Do not break them.<br>\n2. Do not quote any PMs received from the moderator in thread. You may paraphrase.<br>\n3. Do not contact other players about the game outside the game thread. This includes PMs and off-site communications.<br>\n4. Play to your win condition. <br>\n5. Do not use tiny text, cryptography or anything along those lines.<br>\n6. Do not bring provable randomness into the game. This includes dice tags.<br>\n7. Keep it civil. Do not flame or personally attack other players. Attack the play, not the player.<br>\n8 Do not impersonate the moderator. <div style=\"display:inline;color:#0040BF\">This is my color. Don't use it.</div><br>\n8. If you die you are allowed one \"Bah\" post. Do not include anything game related in your post.<br>\n9. Each day phase will last 14 days and each night phase will last 2 days.<br>\n10. Players who have not posted for 48 hours will receive a prod. After receiving a prod, a player has 24 hours to post before I will begin seeking a replacement. If a player receives three prods they will be replaced.<br>\n11. Players on V/LA will be exempt from the prod rules above.<br>\n12. Use vote tags or bold tags to place votes. As long as it can be reasonably interpeted as a vote I will accept it. Do not attempt to use this rule to engage in vote trickery. Examples of acceptable votes:<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: SirCakez</span><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: SirCakez</div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote:</div> SirCakez<br>\n13. Players may vote to end the phase without a lynch. Do this by voting for a nolynch (see below)<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: No Lynch</span><br>\n14. When a player has reached a majority of votes, that player will be lynched and the phase will end.<br>\n15. Players may post after a majority has been reached until I announce the end of the phase.<br>\n16. At least one player will receive this role (see below)<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Welcome to Mini Normal 1769, (player name)!<br>\n<br>\nYou are a <div style=\"display:inline;color:#008000\">Vanilla Townie</div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Abilities</div></div><br>\n-During the day, you may vote for whoever you want lynched.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Win Condition</div></div><br>\nYou win when all threats to the town are eliminated and at least one town-aligned player is alive, or nothing can prevent the same.<br>\n<br>\nThe game thread is here: <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=65508\" class=\"postlink\">http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=65508</a></div></blockquote>", "time": "Fri Feb 26, 2016 1:57 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=65508&start=0", "forum": "53", "thread": "65508"}

I read it as you opposing a mod enforced replacement (this has nothing to do with alignment). Thus, OceanWind's perspective of it being \"lean somewhat town on mn\" is off the mark IMO. However, the fact Golden Robster highlighted Masquerade's post shows that he finds 'something off' with the post. \"probably not town\" is probably a jump to far though.

I don't see you prodding mn over his playstyle as scummy - it seemed like it had the same idea behind it (to get the game rolling and to get the measure of mn) as when I did it. While I wouldn't say I get any strong townread out of it I certainly wouldn't push back against somebody townreading you in the way that Golden has. I'm not sure where the Masquerade townread is coming from, either, and despite some fairly obvious opportunities to do so before I asked Golden hasn't explained it. <br>\n<br>\nThe scumread on Ocean is partially based on disagreement over those reads and I think partially based on Ocean not answering Golden's questions immediately - considering Ocean wasn't really dodging but instead pushing on an apparent inconsistency in Golden's reads (and chasing that would be more useful for Ocean before giving his own reads, rather than after) I don't think that that was scummy myself.<br>\n<br>\nOn the other hand, Golden's pushing is putting alignment-relevant stuff in the thread, which is good at this stage.

Please come back soon. :3<br>\n<br>\nAt this point I have a pretty decent town read on Slandaar, mostly because he's been hitting points that are also on my mind as I'm reading the thread.  The Kain point in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7711492#p7711492\">Post 175</a> is a great example and the things he's bringing up in his conversation with Keyser are others (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7714305#p7714305\">Post 229</a>).  <br>\nI'm also townreading Aquanim, mostly from <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7707941#p7707941\">Post 101</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7711209#p7711209\">Post 161</a>.  His end of the conversation about Robster makes enough sense and I think it makes me more inclined to think he was actually initiating a conversation to double check a read he was iffy on.  <br>\nFrom the few data points out there, I think Oceanwind is more likely town than not because of <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7705124#p7705124\">Post 79</a>.  I can't say I agree with the Keyser townread, but the mn town read looks good and hit's the sweet spot in efficacy.<br>\n<br>\nEven though I dislike most of what he's done in this game immensely, I think it's far more likely that Robster is town than not.  Even though the OceanWind read doesn't seem to be based on much, I have to think it's sincere (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7704902#p7704902\">Post 74</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7704925#p7704925\">Post 75</a>).  I hate the way he's approaching the Kain read.  Drawing the conclusion that Kain is a \"mislynch\" at 3 votes is just terrible.  I hate, hate, hate the way he's trying to marginalize me by glibly dismissing me as scum with this lazy and easily disproved argument that I bogarted Slandaar's case.<br>\n<br>\nKeyser Soze is someone who I really wish would make <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">less frequent</div>, better quality posts.  I'm not saying that to be mean, but the signal to noise ratio in that ISO is insane and that's why the read there is so elusive for me.  I keeping thinking it's more likely he's town but whenever I try to make myself happy with that read and move on I just can't because there's a shortage of strong, decisive, legitimate thoughts in his posts.<br>\n<br>\nNow to Kain:  You can say whatever you want about personality, but I'm not voting him based on that.  I'm voting him because I think what he's doing is a lot more likely to help scum in their win condition than town in their win condition.  Specifically, I think he's saying things for the sole purpose of getting townread.  Saying that he's lynchbait is intellectually lazy and doesn't answer the fundamental question of if he drew a scum card <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">in this game</div> or not.  Being a VI doesn't make them town all the time.  I don't even think the label \"VI\" even really accurately describes Kain because there are a few places in his posting that show calculation and capacity for guile.  If there's a place where anyone thinks he gives a legitimate read or town motivated post, I'm all ears, but don't just tell me about his personality because fuck you, that's irrelevant.", "time": "Thu Mar 03, 2016 2:13 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=65508&start=250", "forum": "53", "thread": "65508"}

I can well imagine a town-Golden Robster calling out someone for requesting a force-replace on mn, whatever GR's read on mn actually is. <br>\n<br>\nHowever, the part referencing Ocean's read on Masquerade I feel has a bit more meat on it. Golden is at least probing at Masquerade with this post (trying to find out the motivation behind the force-replace request) and I certainly couldn't see any good reason to think Masquerade was town at the time. Pushing GR over this, even if the evidence that Golden previously townread Masquerade was pretty slim, was I imagine partly directed at finding out the reason for GR's town read on Masquerade (which IIRC never did get explained).<br>\n<br>\nThis was pretty early in the game, so Ocean reaching a bit for material doesn't seem that scummy to me. I know I've fallen into the trap of \"point A is scummy, point B is similar so it must be scummy too (even though point B is much more tenuous)\" myself in the past.", "time": "Fri Mar 04, 2016 2:29 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=65508&start=300", "forum": "53", "thread": "65508"}

It didn't look like Golden Rpbster was defending mn. Somebody wanting mm replaced because of their playstyle is kind of drastic, so it's weird that ocean wind isn't acknowledging that at all. There's no accusatory tone and he isn't acting like masquerade isn't town. So Oceanwind is just trying really hard to get golden robster lynched. What do you think about it?</div></blockquote><br>\nI agree that the part of Ocean's argument referencing mn isn't very good. I can well imagine a town-Golden Robster calling out someone for requesting a force-replace on mn, whatever GR's read on mn actually is. <br>\n<br>\nHowever, the part referencing Ocean's read on Masquerade I feel has a bit more meat on it. Golden is at least probing at Masquerade with this post (trying to find out the motivation behind the force-replace request) and I certainly couldn't see any good reason to think Masquerade was town at the time. Pushing GR over this, even if the evidence that Golden previously townread Masquerade was pretty slim, was I imagine partly directed at finding out the reason for GR's town read on Masquerade (which IIRC never did get explained).<br>\n<br>\nThis was pretty early in the game, so Ocean reaching a bit for material doesn't seem that scummy to me.

They are all 'could be this, could be that' posts designed to plant seeds in other people's thoughts and allow them to carry out his work for him. Look through his posts in the first 5 pages, he states a lot of things but he always refrains from committing to a read. Keeps all his reads in limbo so he can change them as and when he needs to.<br>\n<br>\nIs he transparent? Again, sure he is. But what is he achieving? He isn't pushing anything, he isn't stating scum reads, he isn't stating people he would like to see lynched for x, y and z reasons. He is simply throwing out a lot of thoughts and seeing what sticks.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7707999#p7707999\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7707999#p7707999\" data-post-id=\"7707999\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 108</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=25845\">Keyser S&#246;ze</a> wrote:</cite><br>\nMy vote is still on BlueBloodedToffee - it has evolved into a serious vote as his contributions so far are 'unsatisfying' - he's usually a player who makes things happen - not sit back.</div></blockquote><br>\nI was going to say I'm surprised that your vote is still on me despite what's happening in game but then I remembered you would love to lynch me if you were scum.<br>\n<br>\nMe being your biggest scum read at this point of the game is pretty poor by anyone's standards.

Both scum and town can demonstrate a \"lack of commitment and conviction\" in a read. You do not scum read and lynch someone based on this - it is tactically naive and absurd. I would actually be more fearful of players who push a 'closed case' strong read of a player after a short/light catch-up.

I see overwhelming tells in his play that I usually associate with scum behaviour, but I personally attach alot of importance to WIFOM in my analysis. Therefore, the fact I can't see KainTepes possessing the scum-motivation to be lynched/investigated early forces me to null-read KainTepes.

You aren't even willing to commit to thread, over 15 pages and you are JUST NOW reading the ENTIRE thread???? Your Keyser case is awful, the first problem being that Keyser has been actively trying to solve the game and scumhunt. His questions and comments all seem to have a genuine purpose bhind them, and Idc if he's wrong --&gt; I learned a few things last game, one of them being your consistent reads are probably what you think they are. - <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Almost Confirmed-Scum-Indicative</div> (Haven't seen Keyser in a few pages though.....)</div><br>\n<br>\n20. <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Also scum-reading Guy Fawkes &amp; Aqua as of <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7721825#p7721825\">457</a></div><br>\n<br>\n21. <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Eh, scratch that, I like Pops more for scum as of <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7724183#p7724183\">484</a></div><br>\n<br>\n22.

My guess as far as OceanWind is he either left the site or just couldn't keep up; if you didn't notice, the slot hadn't said asnything in 300+ pages. That should be a clue it's not scum lurking. Keyser is definitely on my town list. And Aqua was great at the beginning, meh in the middle, a bit scummy towards 457, and back to towny as of now. Aka, I'm pretty sure Aqua is town. So, I don't believe in your statement Kein, esp. when you are impossible to read and are constantly OMGUSing players. - <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Null-Indicative</div></div><br>\n<br>\n23. <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\"><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7724473#p7724473\">502</a> - Are you referring to Mini 1755?

That is hyper weak, but I'm fine withit because I understand the situation we're in and what we have to work with. But if you're allowed to toss out comments like that in relation to your case, I'm at a loss as to where you get off saying a \"he's not scumhunting case\" is \"not that great\". Eh, maybe not, but it is as great as anything else out there, and is better than more than half of them. It is at least a valid statement that can be debated - is or isn't the slot scumhunting? You can at least look over posts and assess that.<br>\n<br>\nThe case Ircher raised on BBT (and that you apparently agree with) basically is a complaint that he did a whole thread review (something Ircher just did...so I'm not sure why that freaks him out) and then \"tunneled\" on Keyser. Since you seem to have issues with Kain and could be accussed of \"tunneling\" that slot, I am not sure why you find \"tunneling/focus\" to be a bad thing. Like, that's a case that makes little to no sense to me, even compared to the weak case I am pushing on Keyser which you don't seem to like for not being strong enough, yet you're backing Ircher's case which is worse.<br>\n<br>\nCan you respond with some thoughts on the above in a general sense?<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7730160#p7730160\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7730160#p7730160\" data-post-id=\"7730160\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 642</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=23900\">Aquanim</a> wrote:</cite>- <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7708311#p7708311\" class=\"postlink\">#129</a> looks like Kain is hiding behind it being early in the day to avoid discussing his scumreads.

You seem to think that tunneling = scum which is a thought that has absolutely no support from even a cursory review of previous mafia games on this (or any) site. Tunneling = anti-town. Tunneling is used by scum sometimes, but tunneling is often a result of town thinking they are right. What tunneling means in its true anti-town definition is that the player is question is ignoring other elements in the game for his one purpose.<br>\n<br>\nBBT is not tunneling.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nBBT *is* pretty focused on you, but, so am I, and so are a few other players. There is absolutely many pro-town benefits to being focused on a player you think is scum - because, well, there are pro-town benefits to lynching scum, and the way you lynch scum is to get people to vote them, and the way you get people to vote someone is that you talk about that person. Since his focus is your stated issue with him, already your scum vibe there falls immensely flat for me.<br>\n<br>\nConversely - go and read his interplay from the page I noted him as a town read, he is talking to TTH. He makes multiple comments about multiple players and expresses many views that seem open minded and built to generate discussion. Not only is this the opposite of tunneling (and shows that his focus is healthy, and not blind in any way) it also looks immensely town.<br>\n<br>\nI don't see the confusion from your end at all, nor do I even see justification for the tunneling call other than as a bit of stretched truth in a purely defensive maneuver.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7731523#p7731523\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7731523#p7731523\" data-post-id=\"7731523\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 699</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=315\">massive</a> wrote:</cite>Yeah, I don't know.

Keyser does an ISO of BBT in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7730171#p7730171\">643</a> - <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">I've already expressed that I felt BBT's push/\"case\" against Keyser was rather weak, opportunistic, and scum-motivated.

Addressing some points in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7730256#p7730256\">646</a> - <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">1) Why is the thread review a problem - While I replaced in, and therefore, yesterday was my first opportunity to review the thread, BBT has been in the game since the start, yet by the sound of 1 of his posts, it seemed like he wasn't reading the thread at all. 2) I feel the tunnel by BBT is not only pathetic, but opportunistic and scum-motivated; BBT seems to be pushing a not-well supported, holey case on a slot that a lot of people express mild annoyance/scumreads of.</div><br>\n<br>\n6. Keyser claims Thor is running people to L-1 without providing his own thoughts in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7730392#p7730392\">648</a>. Thor responds with <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7730438#p7730438\">649</a> with details on why some of the things Keyser said in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7730392#p7730392\">648</a> are untrue or inaccurate. - <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">I actually like both for town. Keyser provides a pretty good post explaining his read of Thor, and actually supports it fairly decent. (Actually, it wasn't just the L-1 shenanigans that led to a scumread of Thor -- Masq played a role as does the fact that Thor almost immediately suggests it after replacing in. Thor then points out an inaccuracy in Keyser's post which I like cuz again, he is supporting his claim. In this case, I don't think Keyser was intentionally trying to misrep Thor by stating he didn't provide any thought, I think it has to do with tunnelling &amp; confirmaion bias between the two.</div><br>\n<br>\n7.

Keyser's made some long posts that didn't really go anywhere (e.g. <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7718350#p7718350\" class=\"postlink\">this stuff on mn</a>, <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7718008#p7718008\" class=\"postlink\">his list of reasons to lynch Kain</a>) but I've seen posts like that from him as town (e.g. <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7460793#p7460793\" class=\"postlink\">this</a>).<br>\n- I can't see any good reason why Keyser would flip as he did about Kain as scum.

My thoughts on Keyser &amp; Thor - actively trying to scumhunt &amp; get reads - as stated in third section of <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7733561#p7733561\">748</a> - <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Let's take a step back &amp; review the 2 main cases worth noting: Keyser &amp; BBT<br>\n<br>\nThe Keyser case is mainly about the fact that despite Keyser's heavy posting, his posts are empty and don't lead anywhere. A supplementary reason is the number of null reads Keyser has expressed.<br>\n<br>\nThe BBT case is mainly about BBT's tunnel on Keyser. Unlike other tunnels, etc. conducted on Keyser, the BBT tunnel seems scum-motivated. A supplementary element of the case is the intense skimming/lack of reading that is being done by BBT.<br>\n<br>\nNow, that was as unbiased as I can I sum it up. So, tell me, <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Is there a whole bunch different to the main reason of both cases? I think not. So, why then is the Keyser wagon not equally as great as the BBT wagon?</div> That's a question from an unbiased perspective. From a biased stance, I'd say the BBT wagon is better supported by the facts.</div><br>\n<br>\n5.

I will be honest and admit that both cases have some major flaws that no one has really addressed. That's why the comparison is made, based on the objective material, both cases are fairly equal. It's when we add in bias that makes the diff. between my thoughts on BBT versus my thoughts on Keyser. Also, I have town meta with Keyser, so that also affects my view.</div><br>\n<br>\n9. In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7734410#p7734410\">776</a>, BBT states \"Prodge\" (not a typo). - <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">That literally sounds like Prod+Dodge combined.

Did you roll scum again, and since you know I am pretty easy to lynch early or pretty easy to lynch late, you're trying to use that to your advantage?

Let's start with <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7736431#p7736431\">809</a>: Keyser is asking KT how he views the other players defending Keyser in terms of his belief that scum will WK scum as losing scum makes scum more likely to lose. - <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Tell me what is empty about this post -- Keyser is asking KT a question that basically amounts to a meta question. What I think KS is aiming for here is an answer that will help Keyser better guage Kain's experience, beliefs, and playstyle. The first step to determining if a player is scum is imo learning how they play.</div><br>\n<br>\n3. Thor suggests in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7736475#p7736475\">811</a> for us to hop onto the Keyser wagon despite having 3 days left. - <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Confirmation bias? Definitely. Scum? Probably not. Bad Town? High chance. @Thor -- Stop with your petty little arguments/tunnel on Keyser and start giving your thoughts on other players; in fact, I have no idea where you stand on people such as myself, Boon, pops, and GuyFawkes cuz you're so focused on Keyser.</div><br>\n<br>\n4. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7736500#p7736500\">815</a> - Keyser once again askes Thor for his stance on BBT. - <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Again, this isn't empty posting. Keyser is directly reasking a question Thor has decided to ignore in his *self-righteousness* - Keyser goal in asking this question is trying to guage Thor's reads on everyone besides Keyser. Knowing other people's reads and thoughts is a truly tremendous help in deciphering the puzzle; aka, Keyser is asking for utmost important info.</div><br>\n<br>\n5. Pops says in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7736692#p7736692\">821</a> that only Keyser seems to be enjoying the game. - <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">While almost certainly a joke like your replace out joke, it feels a bit... weird to say. Also, who's to say the rest of us aren't having fun?</div><br>\n<br>\n6. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7736710#p7736710\">822</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7736713#p7736713\">823</a> have no impact on the game, so certainly they must be empty posts! - <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Nah, wouldn't call that empty posting but more like having fun.</div><br>\n<br>\n7. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7736856#p7736856\">833</a> - BBT states \"can't convince scum I'm town\" - <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">This employs two logical fallancies: ORLYScum and Confirmation Bias. First, let's discuss confirmation bias -- it's when you express a strong read on a person generally without unbiased facts to back it up. You also conduct your tunnel at the ignorance of everything else. Then, let's discuss ORLYScum which is when you disregard what a oerson simply because they're scum. This is a logical fallancy, as you are using your subjective view to try to discredit your target's thoughts regadless of the validity of any claims. Neither of these are neccessary alignment-indicative by themselves though.</div><br>\n<br>\n10. Let's take <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7736964#p7736964\">840</a> as another example. - <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">So this is a quote response, so my numbers correspond with the quotes in order:<br>\n<br>\n1. BBT states he'll just give his thoughts. - Keyser responds \"Deal\" as in he's ok ith that. Unlike... let's see... <div style=\"font-size: 200%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Thor</div>, Keyser understands that sometimes you must compromise. Anyway, I think this is what Keyser and all of us on BBT's wagon wanted in the first place -- For BBT to express his thoughts this game aside from his fairly poorly supported Keyser scumread.<br>\n<br>\n2. Thor has suggested Keyser isn't reading, and Keyser responds by stating he is, and the perceived not reading is simply disagreeing -- Not empty posting, this is Keyser offering another outlook on the situation to Thor (who cannot seem to understand that Mafia is a.... TEAM GAME....). This is def. what I thought when Thor made that comment.<br>\n<br>\n3. No comment<br>\n<br>\n4. Keyser points out that Thor keeps saying he scumreads Keyser, yet has yet to provide a logical reason why. I'll let you be the judge on this one, but my opinion is it's a completely fair argument.<br>\n<br>\n5. Keyser explains his perspective on issues and why he thinks people should express their reads. - Again, Keyser is actively trying to get input from the rest of you, so he can discern people's stances better. Keyser is also admitting that he COULD BE WRONG (*stares at Thor*) and that's why he wants to hear other people's opinions. That's town-motivated imo.<br>\n<br>\n6. Another fun/joke comment. Aka, non alignment indicative.</div><br>\n<br>\n11. Boon apparently is leaning towards scum-Ircher in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7737024#p7737024\">844</a> - <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">I am interested in hearing what the case against me is, <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">excluding any and all pre-flip associations with Keyser</div></div><br>\n<br>\n12.

Just like Boonskiies tunnel of me in Mini 1755. Guess what -- we were both town. Stop with your stupid Keyser tunnel!</div><br>\n<br>\n15. In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7737131#p7737131\">854</a>, Keyser is giving his opinion on our lynch possibilities &amp; is asking when a roleclaim should occur. - <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Again, I see town-Keyser trying to work things out with town &amp; trying to get stuff done AS A TEAM.

I don't think we're convinced on the KS is town idea (ie, those on the wagons), so I'm gonna try to guage some of Keyser's posts to see if they are truly \"empty\" as the scum-Keyser case claims.<br>\n<br>\n2. Let's start with <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7736431#p7736431\">809</a>: Keyser is asking KT how he views the other players defending Keyser in terms of his belief that scum will WK scum as losing scum makes scum more likely to lose. - <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Tell me what is empty about this post -- Keyser is asking KT a question that basically amounts to a meta question. What I think KS is aiming for here is an answer that will help Keyser better guage Kain's experience, beliefs, and playstyle. The first step to determining if a player is scum is imo learning how they play.</div><br>\n<br>\n3. Thor suggests in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7736475#p7736475\">811</a> for us to hop onto the Keyser wagon despite having 3 days left. - <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Confirmation bias? Definitely. Scum? Probably not. Bad Town? High chance. @Thor -- Stop with your petty little arguments/tunnel on Keyser and start giving your thoughts on other players; in fact, I have no idea where you stand on people such as myself, Boon, pops, and GuyFawkes cuz you're so focused on Keyser.</div><br>\n<br>\n4. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7736500#p7736500\">815</a> - Keyser once again askes Thor for his stance on BBT. - <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Again, this isn't empty posting. Keyser is directly reasking a question Thor has decided to ignore in his *self-righteousness* - Keyser goal in asking this question is trying to guage Thor's reads on everyone besides Keyser. Knowing other people's reads and thoughts is a truly tremendous help in deciphering the puzzle; aka, Keyser is asking for utmost important info.</div><br>\n<br>\n5. Pops says in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7736692#p7736692\">821</a> that only Keyser seems to be enjoying the game. - <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">While almost certainly a joke like your replace out joke, it feels a bit... weird to say. Also, who's to say the rest of us aren't having fun?</div><br>\n<br>\n6. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7736710#p7736710\">822</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7736713#p7736713\">823</a> have no impact on the game, so certainly they must be empty posts! - <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Nah, wouldn't call that empty posting but more like having fun.</div><br>\n<br>\n7. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7736856#p7736856\">833</a> - BBT states \"can't convince scum I'm town\" - <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">This employs two logical fallancies: ORLYScum and Confirmation Bias. First, let's discuss confirmation bias -- it's when you express a strong read on a person generally without unbiased facts to back it up. You also conduct your tunnel at the ignorance of everything else. Then, let's discuss ORLYScum which is when you disregard what a oerson simply because they're scum. This is a logical fallancy, as you are using your subjective view to try to discredit your target's thoughts regadless of the validity of any claims. Neither of these are neccessary alignment-indicative by themselves though.</div><br>\n<br>\n10. Let's take <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7736964#p7736964\">840</a> as another example. - <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">So this is a quote response, so my numbers correspond with the quotes in order:<br>\n<br>\n1. BBT states he'll just give his thoughts. - Keyser responds \"Deal\" as in he's ok ith that. Unlike... let's see... <div style=\"font-size: 200%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Thor</div>, Keyser understands that sometimes you must compromise. Anyway, I think this is what Keyser and all of us on BBT's wagon wanted in the first place -- For BBT to express his thoughts this game aside from his fairly poorly supported Keyser scumread.<br>\n<br>\n2. Thor has suggested Keyser isn't reading, and Keyser responds by stating he is, and the perceived not reading is simply disagreeing -- Not empty posting, this is Keyser offering another outlook on the situation to Thor (who cannot seem to understand that Mafia is a.... TEAM GAME....). This is def. what I thought when Thor made that comment.<br>\n<br>\n3. No comment<br>\n<br>\n4. Keyser points out that Thor keeps saying he scumreads Keyser, yet has yet to provide a logical reason why. I'll let you be the judge on this one, but my opinion is it's a completely fair argument.<br>\n<br>\n5. Keyser explains his perspective on issues and why he thinks people should express their reads. - Again, Keyser is actively trying to get input from the rest of you, so he can discern people's stances better. Keyser is also admitting that he COULD BE WRONG (*stares at Thor*) and that's why he wants to hear other people's opinions. That's town-motivated imo.<br>\n<br>\n6. Another fun/joke comment. Aka, non alignment indicative.</div><br>\n<br>\n11. Boon apparently is leaning towards scum-Ircher in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7737024#p7737024\">844</a> - <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">I am interested in hearing what the case against me is, <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">excluding any and all pre-flip associations with Keyser</div></div><br>\n<br>\n12. Boon says I sheeped everywhere in Mini 1755 in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7737064#p7737064\">849</a> - <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Not true! I spent a good amount of time D5 making my opinions as well as D1 and the start of D2. Doing note posts and IO reads are not sheeping. But, if you are gonna meta-dive me, check my wiki page.</div><br>\n<br>\n13. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7737115#p7737115\">852</a> - Main argument from Thor's POV regarding my lynch is *pre-flip association with Keyser* - <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">My two-cents -- For one who is normally found as an easy ML by scum, I'm not feeling it this game. I just don't get why people are even toying with the possibility of scum Ircher when there is only pre-flip association case to look at.</div><br>\n<br>\n14. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7737121#p7737121\">853</a> by Thor states Keyser isn't reading and is merely posting about game theory. - <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">That's one heck of a tunnel you got going there. Just like Boonskiies tunnel of me in Mini 1755. Guess what -- we were both town. Stop with your stupid Keyser tunnel!</div><br>\n<br>\n15. In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7737131#p7737131\">854</a>, Keyser is giving his opinion on our lynch possibilities &amp; is asking when a roleclaim should occur. - <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Again, I see town-Keyser trying to work things out with town &amp; trying to get stuff done AS A TEAM. I don't see scum Keyser making an empty post about wagons.</div></div></div></div></div></blockquote><br>\nYup, Ircher's town-read of me is spot on. He has basically just unpicked my fucking head.

In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7729606#p7729606\">632</a>, Boon claims I may be town-tunneling Keyser - <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">That is definitely a possibility, but I really do feel pretty strong in my townread of Keyser. His wagon seems to be the results of poor reasoning, albeit that might be true of all the current wagons. I will try to keep that in mind.</div><br>\n<br>\n3. Aqua wants to know why people townread Kein in post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7730160#p7730160\">642</a> - <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">I already told you why -- He soft-claimed early. <div style=\"font-size: 65%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">PS: I don't think this lynch will happen; sh!!!</div>Also, Kein is being Kein. I have learned that meta is actually pretty important when reading players... when I first came here, I was like \"Meta doesn't matter....\", but that's not true as everyone plays different. Also, the wa a player plays &amp; the way people respond to them tells a lot about their meta -- I haven't read a single game of another user, but I am able to discern the meta of a player fairly quickly. Some people would be harder to read meta-wise though.</div><br>\n<br>\n4. Keyser does an ISO of BBT in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7730171#p7730171\">643</a> - <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">I've already expressed that I felt BBT's push/\"case\" against Keyser was rather weak, opportunistic, and scum-motivated. This ISO reinforces such a read and also identifies a ton of holes in BBT's Keyser'=Scum case.</div><br>\n<br>\n5. Addressing some points in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7730256#p7730256\">646</a> - <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">1) Why is the thread review a problem - While I replaced in, and therefore, yesterday was my first opportunity to review the thread, BBT has been in the game since the start, yet by the sound of 1 of his posts, it seemed like he wasn't reading the thread at all. 2) I feel the tunnel by BBT is not only pathetic, but opportunistic and scum-motivated; BBT seems to be pushing a not-well supported, holey case on a slot that a lot of people express mild annoyance/scumreads of.</div><br>\n<br>\n6. Keyser claims Thor is running people to L-1 without providing his own thoughts in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7730392#p7730392\">648</a>. Thor responds with <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7730438#p7730438\">649</a> with details on why some of the things Keyser said in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7730392#p7730392\">648</a> are untrue or inaccurate. - <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">I actually like both for town. Keyser provides a pretty good post explaining his read of Thor, and actually supports it fairly decent. (Actually, it wasn't just the L-1 shenanigans that led to a scumread of Thor -- Masq played a role as does the fact that Thor almost immediately suggests it after replacing in. Thor then points out an inaccuracy in Keyser's post which I like cuz again, he is supporting his claim. In this case, I don't think Keyser was intentionally trying to misrep Thor by stating he didn't provide any thought, I think it has to do with tunnelling &amp; confirmaion bias between the two.</div><br>\n<br>\n7.

Thor states he only encourages deadline lynches as scum in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7730838#p7730838\">664</a>. - <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">I don't have a scum meta yet, but I'm the exact opposite! I actively encourage deadline lynches that way we get as much out of our time as possible.</div><br>\n<br>\n10. <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Good, I'm not the only one who thinks <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7730857#p7730857\">668</a> about Keyser. Prove the fundamental argument that Keyser is empty posting, and I will seriously consider joining the wagon.

The familiarity of the Day 1 is just funny to me, and would paint you scum if it was an exact template. Will just be fun to look at post-game. I won as solo scum alive after a successful NK gambit that game. <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\"> one of my prouder moments in Mafia.", "time": "Fri Mar 11, 2016 11:34 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=65508&start=1075", "forum": "53", "thread": "65508"}

I'm not going to give him a pass just because he plays scummy in every game.<br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\nSomeone want to explain Titus to me? I'm not seeing it.</div></blockquote><br>\nFew things:<br>\n<br>\n1. The strong defense of Keyser was genuine. Yet at the same time, I, knowing my meta, am quite well aware that I have a tendency to do stuff that make me an easy mislynch. Therefore, the \"distancing\" was there as a precaution, in the slim case that I was wrong.<br>\n<br>\n2. I've done scummy stuff this game. Rolefishing is definitely one of them. Sometimes, I am not thinking about how things go through, though I admit that the rolefishing was a bit more intentional versus some stuff I've done in the past that has gotten me mislynched.<br>\n<br>\n3. The only thing you've done this game is tunnel me. You didn't give your thoughts about Keyser D1, you never said anything about Thor D2, and you continue to insist on tunneling me when there are so many other people who you should also at least be giving some attention to. Your strategy -- Tunnel me until I'm lynched makes zero sense and does not help town because there are 3 mafia. It may be acceptable if there was 1 scum left, or we're searching for a SK, but tunneling me without giving the slightest attn to anyone else (What's your thoughts on Kein? Boon? Titus? (You say you townread him in the quoted post -- why?) Keyser?). I may be slightly misrepping you here -- maybe you have given some opinions on some other people besides me. But the core point persosts, you haven't tried to analyze anyone except me despite knowing there are multiple scum.<br>\n<br>\n4. So in other words, you are saying that having a meta of being easily mislynched due to scummy actions means you are EVEN MORE likely to scumread a player for that. Again, I admit, some of the stuff I've done here have been blatantly poor/scummy, and while I intentionally did do some of it (Rolefishing, poor VCA), I had no intentions of manipulating / using my meta as a way to defend myself for those actions (let me clarify: I'm defending myself with meta, but I am also taking responsibility for my actions. Rather than just using my meta, I'm also admitting that my play in some ways deserves to be found scummy). Back to the original point -- Meta is not something you just trash. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Meta is important</div> A solely meta defense or meta scum-read is NOT what I mean by meta is important -- That fails as meta can be manipulated and is always changing. No, what I'm saying is that meta lays the foundation for how you read a player. Let me use you as an example: you have a meta of lurking. While lurking is generally scummy (antitown at least), it's not a very valid argument against you since you do it regardless of alignment. People therefore CANNOT base their read of you SOLELY on your activity as lurking is what you do as your playstyle. A person who has a tendency to do scummy stuff (as town) that gives them mislynched should mean that players should be more cautious in scumreading them. Yet, you imply that the opposite should be expected. Why? What's the point of having a meta if you ignore it / are held to an illogical standard that is the opposite of your meta?", "time": "Tue Mar 22, 2016 10:33 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=65508&start=1700", "forum": "53", "thread": "65508"}

Also, what do you make of both Ircher and Aqua jumping to his defence?</div></blockquote><br>\nIrcher has been defending him all game, with absolutely zero reason to actually do so, including trying to fluff over anybody \"reading anything into it\" and magically calling Keyser v. Thor \"town vs town\" (<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7732665#p7732665\" class=\"postlink\">730</a>). His entire reason for \"97% confidence\" is \"I have seen nothing that isn't town-motivated from this slot.\" That's <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7729084#p7729084\" class=\"postlink\">611</a>.

(That's also where you can see he'd rather no-lynch than vote Keyser.) The worst part is that, beyond blanket statements saying \"Keyser is town,\" there's no further interaction. There's no sense of Ircher wanting to work with Keyser in terms of town bloc; there's just continued defense and no cause.<br>\n<br>\nSo here's my problem. I don't think Ircher-scum sticks his neck out like this for Keyser-scum. I think Ircher knows Keyser is town, starts defending him, and just goes full balls-to-the-wall trying for the towncred once Keyser gets flipped as town. <br>\n<br>\nAquanim's Keyser association seems to start as anti-Kain sentiment. \"The enemy of my enemy\" and such. But the interaction seems a little more two-way ... spots where Aquanim is trying to understand Keyser's thoughts, or trying to -- well, I don't want to say \"massage,\" but that's accurate -- massage Keyser's thoughts closer to his. It strays towards good town work (this isn't alignment-indicative, you're reading this wrong).", "time": "Mon Mar 28, 2016 3:17 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=65508&start=1875", "forum": "53", "thread": "65508"}
