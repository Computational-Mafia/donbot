I reserve the right to edit these rules at any time should something truly unexpected occur.<br>\n<br>\n01. All votes must be made bold or made using the vote tag. Unvoting is not required but I heavily prefer it. Any attempts at disguising your voting will be prohibited. If its treated as a vote and I think its a vote, its a a vote!<br>\n<br>\n02. A majority of votes is required to lynch. If there is a lynch, no amount of bitching will prevent the lynch from happening. I am a moderator, not a charity. <br>\n<br>\n03. When you live, live well. Live long. Prosper. When you're dead, shut up. Don't post in the games thread. Lie in a grave/furnace/corpse pile. Rot. <br>\n<br>\n04. All days have a 14 day deadline. All nights have a 48 hour deadline. The thread will lock during night given the nature of the game<br>\n<br>\n05. You can vote for no lynch to occur during the day. Simply post <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: No Lynch</span>. Should this vote reach a majority, it will happen. If no majority is reached during a day then there will be a no lynch when that day ends<br>\n<br>\n06. Quoting or faking any PMs you receive from the mod will get you modkilled and blacklisted from any games I am running now or in the future. You may paraphrase anything in the PM. If you are worried you are quoting more so then paraphrasing you should probably PM me before I modkill you<br>\n<br>\n07. Each player must post every 48 hours. If they do not, I will prod them. If they don't respond to the prod in 2 days, then they will be replaced. If you have already received 2 prods and you go idle for 48 hours a 3rd time, I will force replace you. This rule will be temporarily ignored if you give V/la notice 2 days before going V/la. Anyone found to be faking V/la will be mod killed<br>\n<br>\n08. Don't talk to each other outside of the game thread unless your role says you can. If you disobey this rule, you will be modkilled or force replaced pending the severity of your actions<br>\n<br>\n09. No small or invisible text. Don&#8217;t edit/delete previously submitted posts if you have the power to do so<br>\n<br>\n10. This is a game. Have fun and respect the other players. <br>\n<br>\n11. If it seems like it should be illegal, it probably is. Considering the fact rules sometimes can't cover everything. Please use your common sense. PM me if you think something you are about to do could break the rules or possibly ruin the game. <br>\n<br>\n12. I am human. If I fuck up and make a mod error that personally looses you the game, then I will give you a technical auto win at the end of the game to make up for it <br>\n<br>\n13. I respect anonymity on the internet and in mafia. If there is a scum group with a quick topic or private topic, I will <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">NOT</div> be posting a link to it at the end of the game. It is that scum teams decision as to whether or not a link to their quick topic or private topic will be posted at the end of the game<br>\n<br>\n14. If I have to modkill a player, the following will occur. If that player was town, the day will immediately end as though they were the lynch. If that player was non-town the day will continue. Basically the worst case scenario will occur for their side. Please don't make me have to invoke this rule or any modkill related rules. I don't want to do it, I felt bad just writing them<br>\n<br>\n15. The game will start with a Pregame phase. During this phase, any roles with the power to night talk may talk. Pregame will last 48 hours, you must PM a confirm to me saying you received and understand your role during Pregame, or i will look to replace you during day 1<br>\n<br>\n16. If you have a night action and think you will be V/la during the night cycle, you can send the action to me in advance<br>\n<br>\n17. If you have a night action and have already sent a target for your action, you can change your target before the night is over by sending me a message with the new choice<br>\n<br>\n18. If you have a night action and forget to send me a choice, you get nothing.<br>\n<br>\n19. Posting in the game thread can be done during twilight by any living player including the person who was just lynched, up until the mod locks the thread<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">20: If you ask for a player to be prodded and this player posts before I send him the prod, it does not count as one of their allowed prods. I got to send it to them for it to count.  I'll send them \"I'm replacing you\" in the 3rd message.  This message must be sent before I replace them.  Once its sent, no matter of posting will stop it.  I plan to send this same message when a player doesn't answer/post after an allowed prod and the same rules will apply there.  Once I say \"I'm replacing you\" it will happen</div><br>\n<br>\nVanilla Townie PM:<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>You are a <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vanilla Townie</div>.

You overreacted to my \"Claim Jumper\" comment.  Someone with your experience should know by now that people do reaction testing via votes.  <br>\n<br>\nYour approach to the game is different from mine to begin with because you feel that people should vote whom they think is scum.  I've gone for as long as 7 pages without being sure of whom is scum but I've still managed to place \"serious votes\" before then.  However you questioned farside for NOT VOTING which made me wonder in light of my previous comment about how sometimes it takes a long time to vote for scum.  This seemed like fakescumhunting to me so I \"serious\" voted you.<br>\n<br>\nAlso you say that your playstyle is \"off-beat\" but then you start taking my off-beat playstyle so seriously.  If your style is \"offbeat\" then you should be able to recognize another \"offbeat\" style and be able to better read or at least understand it.  In light of your lack of empathy for a playstyle that's similar to yours suggests that you claimed to have an off-beat style just to deflect any future awkwardness.<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot#Knot_tying\" class=\"postlink\">What kind of Knot do you prefer with your noose?</a>", "time": "Fri Jul 25, 2014 8:52 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=58515&start=75", "forum": "53", "thread": "58515"}

As Bob says here, it's more annoying and even offputting than it is contributing anything to the overall game. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6049316#p6049316\">89</a> is a good example of this. <br>\n<br>\nThe posts he's making come across as forced, overdone and as thought they're nervous responses to the things SK is saying. I don't even think SK's case is particularly strong (Bob's point against reinoe, as I've stated before, is much better and more succinct), but reinoe has really been reacting to it badly. <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Bob 99 wrote:</cite>He's barely made any case at all against you aside from asking questions which have mostly either gone unanswered or have been answered by other people. You started flipping out at him in Post 46 which was before he'd said anything at all about you other than \"hey everyone should join my wagon\".</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nThis is on point as well.<br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>pops 101 wrote:</cite>Why is everyone ignoring my case on Konowa? His reaction was \"sounds about right\".</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nBecause it's not particularly strong in light of what's been presented against Drew and reinoe.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>pops 103 wrote:</cite>Even if I do buy it, skimming thread is correlated with a scum alignment, so that's no salvation</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nThat's ridiculous. That's definitely something that's dependent on the person, and you know that. <br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>farside 111 wrote:</cite>Why do you think the rvs question from sk is important to awnser?</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nIt seems to me it doesn't really matter if it's important or not to you, farside. Unless you're prepared to call one of them scum/town because of the question/answer, then it seems like you're unnecessarily intervening. <br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>pops 114 wrote:</cite>Scum tend to be less motivated and to be having less fun, as a rule. That means they are less likely to read the thread, much like you are less likely to read every word of a boring text than of a good novel.<br>\n<br>\nThat's for the average person, it might not apply to you. Maybe you like playing scum, or you read everything either way but have a meticulous attitude as scum.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nThis is more accurate. I don't think you should be making the assumption you did in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6051033#p6051033\">103</a> unless you have experience with the player or some other means of making that assumption. <br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Goofy 146 wrote:</cite>The end of the game will be here and I still won't have answered it, reads coming tomorrow maybe, bed now.</div></blockquote><br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6052979#p6052979\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6052979#p6052979\" data-post-id=\"6052979\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 151</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=24026\">Goofyd00d</a> wrote:</cite>Fine, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ\" class=\"postlink\">here</a></div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nThis reads as annoying, but, honestly, more townie than scummy. I don't think scumGoofy would be so prideful as to essentially spit in the face of SK as his responses here seems to indicate. Maybe, but my impression is no. I won't be the first person on board to defend Goofy this game, but, on the back of these posts, I have no intention of pursuing a lynch on him right now. He reads more as a unnecessarily prideful townie here.<br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Dessew 157 wrote:</cite>pops is town, obv, I'm gonna sheep him.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nWhy?

Ergo, pursuant to reinoe's own signature, he seems to be fabricating his scumread. <br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\nIAI's <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6053333#p6053333\">160</a> is a good point, and we agree about Goofy (although him backing away from it is kinda bleh, but I just don't think he's considering it enough).<br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>CD 169 wrote:</cite>Constantly bringing up the same thing over, and over again just to squeeze out more content and a marginally justified vote.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nIf you think SK's vote is justified, even \"marginally\" so, then why do you think he's scum?

Have you tried asking Konowa what alignment he prefers playing as...? I don't even think Konowa's posts have been all that great, but your constant yapping has, if anything, made me more sympathetic of Konowa. <br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\nfarside's <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6053911#p6053911\">185</a> is good and tells me that farside and Goofy are probably not scum together. There was no reason to bring this up otherwise. If she wanted to bus him, she could just complain about his low activity without actually bringing this up. If she wanted to defend him more strongly, she didn't have to bring it up at all.<br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>CD 189 wrote:</cite>If I hear you talk about RVS one more time I'm going ask for a mass claim in the hopes there is a day vig so that he can shoot you for the sake of my sanity. You are trying to squeeze a dry orange to look town. STAHP.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nWhy is this getting under your skin so much? It's actually caused me to evaluate farside, Goofy and SK better than possibly anything else in the game thus far. <br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>SK 190 wrote:</cite>It really isn't, and you shouldn't be making excuses instead of contributing.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nI concede that was a bad post.

This post strikes me as fake. The offensive overtures don't really comfort me that he's at all interested in finding scum, but moreso interested in his image. His Konowa vote in particular sullies the wagon on Konowa and has me thinking that Konowa is town. I mean, he kind of has a blanket scumread on several people here (Dessew, CD, Goofy myself, SK, reinoe and IAI), but he chooses Konowa to vote? The only people he seems comfortable calling a townread is farside, which is absurd. I don't have a problem with a town or scumread on farside, but you'd be hard pressed to sway me in either direction to the extreme. <br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Goofy 227 wrote:</cite>The 4 you had made? why include spoilers if you arent including quotes?

I tend to think those aren't exactly \"townreads\", lol. Call me crazy, but it doesn't seem like you respect their opinions very much. Also, given that you're scumreading me while calling me a dick, it stands to reason that when you call someone a dick, you're effectively calling them scum. <br>\n<br>\nBut I'm guessing calling someone a dick or an \"annoying cock\" is just your way of showing affection?

It's absurd to say that she's obvious town and your only townread. It would be just as absurd to say that she's obvious scum and someone's only scumread.

You'll notice Konowa in there.  Now farside NEVER EXPLAINS HER SCUMREAD ON KONOWA.  Not ever.  Look through here ISO if you don't believe me.  Now read my 268.  Read it carefully.  Take your time.  Now you see how the thing I mentioned is that RedCoyote is sheeping AN ARGUMENT SOMEONE ELSE POSTED?  I am not accusing RedCoyote of sheeping a vote.  Those are two different things.  Since farside has never posted an argument for her scumread it would be impossible for me to be sheeping her reason except under one condition...You're accusing farside and I of talking about this game outside of this forum.  Is that what you're doing?  Are you accusing farside and I of cheating?

Then he calls sheeping an argument scummy, which is just stupid. Then he goes on a fantastical tangent about me supposedly accusing him and you (farside) of cheating, which is just unnecessary noise and bullshit. He continues on by saying that sheeping a vote is okay to do (remember, sheeping an argument is not!). I don't like his point 1 here on a gut level (this is probably me stretching but idrc). If he isn't sheeping your vote, then I don't think he should care enough about it to put it in the finale of the argument. But I can understand why you'd disagree, and it really isn't that important. This is still all bullshit.<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6063079#p6063079\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6063079#p6063079\" data-post-id=\"6063079\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 295</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=23727\">reinoe</a> wrote:</cite>Lastly is your hyperbole.  <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>SleepyKrew wrote:</cite> Basically, he didn't think his lie through. </div></blockquote><br>\nThis is over the top here.

When I saw that I was simply moving from one wagon to starting a new one, I figured 'Why change given I feel they're both scum' and stayed on one with momentum.

But let me ask you something - if you have 6 people, and a cop has investigated two to find town, you can by PoE move the chances of hitting scum from 1 / 6 to 1 / 3 - that is process of elimination. Doing it without cop assistance is far more prone to error but a cop, in essence, is attempting to find scum but when they find town is performing PoE. <br>\n<br>\nSo no - it is not ultimately flawed, but it is risky. And legitimate. <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I disagree here. Drew is actively trying to stop the reino wagon. This to me screams my buddy is in trouble let's help him.

I think he's town and we're looking to mislynch based on faulty argument. Why wouldn't I defend him? [/quote]<br>\nBecause you are doing the work of someone else when we are trying to figure out if he is scum or not. You are basically letting him sit back and post <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">shit</div> instead of anything else. You are interfering with the town's interrogation. Secondly the reason why you think town cases are good is pretty damn stupid in my honest opinion. You are literally giving away the only secret information you have to the scum. You are using a tactic that has been empirically proven to fail (this was discovered years ago, btw). And to compound it all, you are wrong on reino.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>No, it is an invalid approach. It doesn't work. That is why people don't do it. People have tried. They have failed. </div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nSure. But let me ask you something - if you have 6 people, and a cop has investigated two to find town, you can by PoE move the chances of hitting scum from 1 / 6 to 1 / 3 - that is process of elimination. Doing it without cop assistance is far more prone to error but a cop, in essence, is attempting to find scum but when they find town is performing PoE. <br>\n<br>\nSo no - it is not ultimately flawed, but it is risky. And legitimate. [/quote]<br>\nno, it 100% flawed and you should know better. The reason it is 100% flawed is that the narrowing down process has ALREADY BEEN DONE. PEOPLE HAVE TOWN READS THEY JUST DON'T TELL YOU. Why don't they tell, you may ask. Well because the fucking cop is one of them. Scum sees that shit and are like, \"well, this guy isn't going to get lynched tomorrow because everyone thinks he is town.\" And so then you end up diluting the lynch pool because lynching that scummy player is offset by the NK on your cop friend. <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I disagree here.

You asked me where was the connection between you and reinoe as though there was nothing whatsoever that would put you two together. I said that you were both voting Konowa. I assume that's what this argument was referring to. <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Drew 526 wrote:</cite>Hard defence is not a scum tell. Do you not understand that?</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nI don't know where you're even going with this anymore. All I did was give out my scumreads at the moment and you and reinoe (and farside, too, later in the game) jumped on me for trying to call the whole scumteam. The point is so asinine that I'm upset with having to even \"2+2=4\" thing for you. It makes me think you're just throwing whatever at me until you think something sticks. It's also a waste of time to continually have to rebutt these little, nonsensical points and it drains me mentally to have to do so, which you may very well be trying to use to your advantage.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Drew 526 wrote:</cite>So why not wait until I came back from V/LA to ask me questions before the vote?</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nBecause reasonable townies don't get frightened over having one or two votes on them on D1.

I don't care if reinoe suspected all three of those players or he didn't. He's saying that he has \"super secret\" reasons for all these scumreads that he decided to keep to himself and not post. Then when you come along and vote, he blantantly sheeps you.

Are you really still caught up on the idea that Goofy is scum because he was giving SK the business. I mean, that's really how much you've put into reading this game? I can somewhat understand resigning to the idea that SK and reinoe are both town, but surely scum has influenced one side or another in some way, Dessew? <br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>SK 599 wrote:</cite>Like I've said, and I know you're aware that I said this, reinoe is my only scumread. I've got some suspicions on others but nothing worth pushing yet.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nI don't like this, but it's almost academic for me to say this because I can completely sympathize with SK here. If SK dared to try and speculate as to what other scum there might be, reinoe would call him out for \"lining up lynches\" (as he did to me), Drew will call him out because he \"needs to link his scumreads together\" (as he did to me, despite it being D1 and there not being any flips, investigative results, etc). <br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>reinoe 623 wrote:</cite>1)what are your thoughts on SleepyKrew having one scumread?</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nAcceptable because I suspect you'd attack him regardless (as you have me). <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>reinoe 623 wrote:</cite>2)What are your thoughts on SleepyKrew frequently neglecting to answer questions from several players but asking people to answer his questions?</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nI think you're more guilty of provocation as has been exhibited time and again with your belittling attitude and hypocritical stances. <br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>farside 631 wrote:</cite>Lots of useless questions and the vote based on dessew didn't not come across as a reason to vote Drew.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nI asked three questions.

You ought to invest more time in understanding where I am coming from rather than just parrot Drew's poor \"gotcha\" point. <br>\n<br>\nBecause I thought the players in the game were mature enough to have an open discussion about scum and town reads, I (mistakenly, I realize now) tried to be very open about my scumreads. I speculated out loud that if I had to pick, my scum team would consist of Drew/reinoe and one of pops, Dessew or you. I just wanted to illustrate where I was at that point in time as I tend to do as town. I'm a firm believer in being completely open and honest as town about where I stand at all times. <br>\n<br>\nIn this game, however, I'm inclined to break that tradition. Like SK and reinoe, I don't think I will continue to be open about my reads. I think I will keep them hidden and only tunnel on one player lest farside, Drew or reinoe try to attack me for illogical reads. <br>\n<br>\nfarside, no duh calling the entire scumteam is going to be silly and probably inaccurate on D1. I haven't seen a flip yet. I haven't seen any powers yet... etc. <br>\n<br>\nHeart-to-heart on this one, hon, I think you're either really offbase or scum. I mean, we go back a ways, and I'd like to think we know each other. <br>\n<br>\nSo, a tl;dr answer to this attack is that you're being unfair to assume that those are stagnant scumreads that I'm going to have the rest of this game, farside. <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>farside 631 wrote:</cite>goes from scum read to town read of Drew based on one post?

The best D1 95% of the time is to lynch a non-PR claimed person that a large portion of the game agrees could be scum. Then the next day you analyze what happens overnight along with the wagons of yesterday (especially the lynch wagon). And you repeat that process until the game is over.

That post was made before reinoe claimed. <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>pops 893 wrote:</cite>People were actually posting a bit productively around that time</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nNo, forcing Cyberbob/Drew to either hammer CD or push for another wagon would've been productive.

We have a day and change left. CD has claimed. No other wagon is gaining momentum. reinoe (our closest thing to being confirmed town on D1) is leading the lynch. How close to the wire do you want to cut it? I'm not opportunistically whipping votes; I'm prudently calling for a close to the day.<br>\n<br>\nAlso, in response to the buddying thing, I lumped you and Drew in that post.

Hoping for someone to hammer me without a claim or what? <br>\n<br>\nYou're only upset because I claimed a protective role before you had a chance to fake it at some point later on in the game under the guise of, \"I was fishing for a doctor to throw the scum off!\"<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>IAI 908 wrote:</cite>(Which reminds me, RC DID YOU LEAVE A CRUMB ANYWHERE?)</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nNo, I didn't. I didn't anticipate surviving long in this game.

I've said this twice already. I'm also willing to concede that I'm possibly letting Drew's attitude influence me negatively. <br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Cyberbob 919 wrote:</cite>Saying something dumb and wrong just to try and spring some kind of AHA YOU'RE ROLEFISHING trap on someone when they point out that you are wrong is a questionable tactic at best I would have thought</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nWhat's ironic is IAI was the one originally rolefishing here. He has since accused both you and me of doing it.<br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>pops 929 wrote:</cite>I don't think there's time for an IAI lynch though.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nIAI is far and away the best lynch today, but I'm not a crazy person that tries to wagon as many people as possible with the hopes of one of them copping to being scum. The best D1 95% of the time is to lynch a non-PR claimed person that a large portion of the game agrees could be scum. Then the next day you analyze what happens overnight along with the wagons of yesterday (especially the lynch wagon). And you repeat that process until the game is over. I don't know where this idea came from that people can't compromise on D1, especially a 35+ page D1, and go at it the next day armed with tons of new information.<br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>SK 949 wrote:</cite>This reads like setting up an RC mislynch to win the game.

Some of these people just want to have their cake and eat it, too. I still think farside is probably town, but there is something off about her this game and I absolutely hate her connection with IAI right now. <br>\n<br>\nBtw, if I don't see a CD vote by the time I leave tonight, I'm moving to Drew. If I can be frank, I don't really trust this town to act reasonably. And it's not even just about forcing me to claim. I think we're really fragmented here (as indicated by SK/reinoe, Drew/myself, Goofy/Dessew, etc), and some of you may be forgetting the fundamentals of this being a team game.

I visited reinoe last night. I didn't not try to fake anyone out or try anything risky because I figured even if I had managed to protect one of my other townreads (say you, for instance), I wouldn't be able to tell anyone that and everyone would just assume I protected reinoe anyway.<br>\n<br>\nActually, I think there's a silver lining in this cloud. reinoe's lying was bad play, let's get that right straight away (the potential benefits didn't outweight the potential negatives as we could've easily had someone counterclaim him), but the silver lining is that we may yet have an investigative role of sorts. <br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Dessew 1153 wrote:</cite>I think he fakeclaimed partly not to get lynched, partly he wanted to pull a gambit (I'd say claiming a negative on one of his townreads.)

It was trollish and irresponsible. He couldn't put his pride aside. If he had claimed vig, I'd have voted CD for sure. I had a feeling that he might be town (that's partially why I voted CD instead of Drew after reinoe's claim) and that I was just tunnelling on him, but when IAI and Drew ganged up on me after my claim with no CC... that's was it. I was officially done with him. <br>\n<br>\nFurther, I'll go so far as to say Drew's flip doesn't change my IAI read one bit. If anything, I'm just going to dig in deeper. IAI knows better than to try and push a lynch on a non-cc'd protective role, one that is provable (as I maintain a BG is). The only possible explanation for what he did is if he's gunning to fakeclaim as a protective role. He egged Drew on to push an irresponsible wagon on me. <br>\n<br>\npops and farside were both co-conspirators in that fiasco that was the CD wagon failure, but, to their credit, they backed off after my claim. Cyberbob was kind of too, but at the very least Cyberbob was on record as scumreading me way before I claimed (he even criticized Drew for having the audacity to equate his scumread of me with Cyberbob's, which I found very comical). I can give Cyberbob a pass on this even though he was wrong.<br>\n<br>\nFor my money, it's IAI-pops/farside-beck/CD/maybe Dessew (I have a townread on him for going after IAI at the end of the day like he did, but you can't ignore the neighbor issue now with reinoe's flip).<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: I Am Innocent</span><br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>pops 1160 wrote:</cite>I don't care if he roleblockage or selecting a different player is his excuse.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nGood for you.

ZERO.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nWhat an absolutely manufactured argument. First off, you were effectively missing for the first half of this game, whining about CD when it wasn't relevant to anything. Then, when CD became relevant, you conspicuously abandoned it in favor of voting for a non-CC'd protective role that can be proven. Second, you were supposedly \"willing to switch to Drew\" <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6084371#p6084371\">799</a> (presumably if he didn't go for your sinister bidding), you can't turn around and say that not voting him makes you this town saint. Third, what the heck is wrong with town voting town on D1 of all days? As reinoe said, being wrong isn't a scumtell. If anything, it shows that you're considering opinions that aren't your own and critically thinking.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>IAI 1178 wrote:</cite>How is that obtuse? If any wagon late in the day pops up on any of these players, would you not consider them for a lynch?</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nYou assuming that my scumread on you and my scumread on, for instance, Dessew (a player I made it a point to explain my read on) are equivalent is you being obtuse. No, they are not the same. It's quite clear that you are far and away at the top of that, and I'm going to press for your head before any of the others. <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>IAI 1179 wrote:</cite>RC, I know your lazy/OMGUS'ing, but me, pops, and Farside were not on that Reinoe wagon of 5.

But you have to understand that I'm town and I suspect reinoe, so there's already bias inherent in that. Further, I'm more than willing to alter my reads based on flips. It seems like I had to tell Drew that 5 times, but I guess I'm going to have to be prepared to state it 5 more times. I obviously don't know if that prediction is going to be accurate. It's what I think right now, however.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>IAI 1180 wrote:</cite>And where do you think most scum would go \"If he had claimed vig\"?

To answer your question, however, is to ask you why you'd presume to know what I'd do as scum in the first place? Further, my point was that there are things you need to hold your nose and swallow as town, all differences aside.

This caught my eye immediately because it looked as though he was trying to breadcrumb being a protective role here. He mentions doctor out of nowhere, and the statement is awkward. All he needed to say was that you were his biggest townread. It would then be assumed that he would think you were worthy of a doc protection in his eyes. You may have missed it on the first go around, but I didn't because I knew I had a protective role already. It didn't make sense for someone to throw that out there to me. Another point, I find is conspicious that CD has been really lax about mentioning IAI at all, despite the fact that IAI had been attacking him throughout most of D1. That doesn't look like a town-town relationship to me, but, rather, either scum-scum or scum-town.  Check out <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6091486#p6091486\">906</a> where he tries to throw dirt on my BG claim. Him and Drew try and tag team me and get me lynched post-claim. Also, I have no idea how a BG claim is \"easy\" for scum to fake? Maybe we could ask IAI how it's \"easy\" for me to fake my own death? A doctor is an easy claim to fake, because the scum could always NK if they need to. Remember this is what IAI was angling to do before I called him out. I also want to point out, just so that I am on the record for this and you know this, I wanted IAI lynched yesterday (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6093040#p6093040\">957</a>), but I realized it would be foolish to try and pivot the wagon that late in the day. Three other quick points against IAI: <br>\n<br>\n1) IAI was coming after me for voting CD as opposed to Drew yesterday saying that I flipped my townread on CD. That was a misrepresentation as I explained in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6095264#p6095264\">1106</a>. IAI wanted to know if I would vote CD specifically as a counterwagon to reinoe prior to reinoe's claim. Under those specific conditions, I did not want to vote CD. But after reinoe's claim and the (rightful) collapse of his wagon, CD was no longer a counterwagon to reinoe because reinoe wasn't a viable wagon any longer, do you follow me? <br>\n2) IAI contradicts himself in his own post, calling CD town and then asking players to vote for him in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6095360#p6095360\">1112</a>.<br>\n3) IAI's contention that him not voting reinoe or Drew during D1 in post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6103346#p6103346\">1177</a> is hardly convincing at all. I elaborate as to why in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6103398#p6103398\">1191</a>, but the short of it is that IAI is on record as saying he would vote Drew. It's nonsensical for him to turn right around and claim that him never voting Drew makes him town... he offered to do so!<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>farside 1205 wrote:</cite>I don't see why iai as scum would continue targeting the claim bg.

It only took like three posts to finally goad you into it!\"<br>\n<br>\nPlease don't act like you goaded me into a vote. I suspected you all of D1, and the beginning of D2. My reason for picking you over RC is that with Reinoe dying, it makes his claim more believable. If there was a \"real\" protective role, they would have targeted Reinoe. But it didn't happen, which means a bodyguard is more likely. And a bodyguard does line up better with a town vig (bodyguard could save scum in this situation, if that's who both they and the vig target). So yeah, nice try on trying to discredit my vote.

That is lazy scumhunting...or fake scumhunting. I think you and I both know which. Funny thing is, you said I was scared to start a wagon on you D2...do you know who started the wagon on cooldog? Look it up, it was me. And I didn't move for the longest time. Funny connection you're trying to force there. Esp when D1 ended, and I was saying to everybody, vote cooldog over drew, VT claim over unknown one. Weird way to treat a scummate.

Once again, bad argument on your part.<br>\n<br>\nSleepykrew's 1210 \"What happens if Drew claims? He moves to CD and we'd still have needed two more votes in a very short amount of time.

And with 12 players, a no lynch at some point might make sense, it would have been better than lynching a claimed town vig (who could prove himself at least of being a vig).<br>\n<br>\nDessew's 1214 \"I read IAI's case on RC as if RC's having claimed a BG and lynched a townie played a key role in it, which is just outright absurd.

You bringing that up is town points in your favor. Dessew, for vote count analysis, you need to see who voted the town and for what reasons. Think about how you play as scum, and say, how would I play? If you believe RC is a bodyguard, you must believe scum has a roleblocker. If I was scum then, why would I try to get RC lynched D1 when I could just have him roleblocked and call him a liar D2? Who started D2 with a vote on RC (sleepykrew)? This is what you need to think about/look at.<br>\n<br>\nPops 1216 \"I'm going to sheep Cyberbob a little bit here. I like his work.\"<br>\n<br>\nTell me what you like about his work? And with the whole RC might really be a bodyguard, it does make you look worse. Your the one that was ready to lynch him two days later if he was still alive. Who are your other scum reads?<br>\n<br>\nRCs 1222 \"In regards to IAI, check out 689 where he fishes for a doctor claim.\"<br>\n<br>\nI've done this before as town...wish I had time to dig it up. I stand by my earlier explanation to you. In prior games, I've been called out for it by scum. You calling me out for it, if you really are a bodyguard, does make sense. Cyberbob took the bait tho. Guarantee he is scum. I'm not, sorry.<br>\n<br>\n\"Another point, I find is conspicious that CD has been really lax about mentioning IAI at all, despite the fact that IAI had been attacking him throughout most of D1. That doesn't look like a town-town relationship to me, but, rather, either scum-scum or scum-town. Check out 906 where he tries to throw dirt on my BG claim. Him and Drew try and tag team me and get me lynched post-claim.\"<br>\n<br>\nAnd where did my vote go when nobody jumped on you...back to Cooldog. What do you think about my question to Dessew: If you believe RC is a bodyguard, you must believe scum has a roleblocker. If I was scum then, why would I try to get RC lynched D1 when I could just have him roleblocked and call him a liar D2?<br>\n<br>\n\"Also, I have no idea how a BG claim is \"easy\" for scum to fake? Maybe we could ask IAI how it's \"easy\" for me to fake my own death?\"<br>\n<br>\nWell in all fairness, you haven't died yet. A mysterious \"roleblocker\" or saying I went for Player B instead of Player A are easy ways to fake the claim. But you notice I didn't come out and vote you D2. I'm starting to have doubts about my scum read on you, not going to lie.<br>\n<br>\n\"IAI was coming after me for voting CD as opposed to Drew yesterday saying that I flipped my townread on CD. That was a misrepresentation as I explained in 1106. IAI wanted to know if I would vote CD specifically as a counterwagon to reinoe prior to reinoe's claim. Under those specific conditions, I did not want to vote CD. But after reinoe's claim and the (rightful) collapse of his wagon, CD was no longer a counterwagon to reinoe because reinoe wasn't a viable wagon any longer, do you follow me?\"<br>\n<br>\nRC, you said CD was a town read and you would absolutely not vote him. Then 50 posts later, you voted him. Do you see my issue/concern with your stances and later votes? Scum make up reads, forget them, and vote other people later. I still find that pretty scummy, which is pulling me in the wrong direction of believing your bodyguard claim.<br>\n<br>\n\"IAI contradicts himself in his own post, calling CD town and then asking players to vote for him in 1112.\"<br>\n<br>\nI said I thought both wagons were town. CD had claimed vanilla townie, so my vote was in that direction over the unclaimed player. My preference was obviously you or Cyberbob, but neither of those wagons were taking off at the deadline.<br>\n<br>\n\"IAI's contention that him not voting reinoe or Drew during D1 in post 1177 is hardly convincing at all. I elaborate as to why in 1191, but the short of it is that IAI is on record as saying he would vote Drew. It's nonsensical for him to turn right around and claim that him never voting Drew makes him town... he offered to do so!\"<br>\n<br>\nTalk is cheap, I think I posted that on Page 2 of this thread. Yes I suspected Drew earlier in the day, but when push came to shove, I never moved my vote for him and pushed for Cooldog's lynch over him. If you think lynching a player like me D2 is the way to go, and leaving 5 players who were on both Reinoe's and Drew's wagon alive going into D3, have at it. I'll laugh at the townies responsible for my lynch postgame...<br>\n<br>\n************<br>\n<br>\nSorry I have to run for a few days, hopefully I addressed everyone's questions/comments.", "time": "Mon Aug 11, 2014 1:30 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=58515&start=1225", "forum": "53", "thread": "58515"}

I don't assume scum is on any big town-targetted wagon by default, and in reinoe's case in particular I don't think it's damning to have attacked reinoe.  Cooldog is among those posters whose line of thought seemed wrong, but internally consistent and understandable.  <br>\nMultiple actors seemed to shift focus to/from Drew, so that seems like an informative lynch.  Cooldog was never that popular and just kinda slowly bubbled to a consensus lynch, it doesn't seem that informative.<br>\n<br>\nKonowa lynch would be very informative for similar reasons, and a good deal more likely to flip scum.<br>\n<br>\nThere's a frustratingly long list of lynches I'd prefer to cooldog: Skrew, RC, IAI, goofy.  Drew actually has a poor standing on that list, and sorry @Drew that my vote is parked there, but you have a high viability.

His case, attitude, lack of drive. There is much you can look at and he is either the perfect patsy or he 's scum.<br>\nPops behavior towards cool made no sense as far as rationale goes. If cooldog was scum with pops it would be a certain time you would see a move to bus.

Contented, he walked through the park and gnawed away until he came across a small pond. The dog looked over into the pond and, to his amazement, another dog stared back at him. The other dog had a bone in his mouth that looked bigger than the one he had, so naturally he dropped his and went to grab the other dog's bone. When he dropped the bone, however, it plunged into the water and caused the pond to ripple. The dog could no longer see the bone in the water's reflection, and he lost the bone he had previously had in his mouth. <br>\n<br>\nIAI, you're the dog in this story, my friend. CD, ironically, is the first bone, and I'm the bone in the water's reflection. You thought you could get a BG lynched rather than a VT (or, possibly, scum), thus preventing reinoe from using his supposed tracker ability. I think you overestimated the town's willingness to see things the way you argued, that I was faking my claim. Now that Drew has flipped, and it has lent considerably more credence to my claim, you're rightfully backing away from this position.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>IAI 1365 wrote:</cite>@RC as you reevaluated your reads, what specific thing about cooldog made you feel he was scum?

I'm the most townie player in the game though, of course (I always say this kind of tongue-in-cheek, but it's half serious this game given my claim). farside is a big unknown. Remember that her and pops were best buddies during D1 when pops and her were working to undermine the reinoe wagon (this was a good thing), but then they worked together to undermine the CD wagon (this is an unknown, well, I mean I guess you know if it's good or not, lol). Granted, farside has not been friendly with pops this game as though he's a townread, but she suspects him all the while working with him to get an agenda done. I'm not necessarily saying they're both scum, but their motives are suspect. <br>\n<br>\nAnyway, again, I'm not really unsatisfied with the way these wagons are competing against each other (I think that's very healthy and it lends itself to questioning players' motives tomorrow, especially the hammerer), but I think IAI is the clearly superior wagon. <br>\n<br>\nWhere's Goofy been?

This caught my eye immediately because it looked as though he was trying to breadcrumb being a protective role here. He mentions doctor out of nowhere, and the statement is awkward. All he needed to say was that you were his biggest townread. It would then be assumed that he would think you were worthy of a doc protection in his eyes. You may have missed it on the first go around, but I didn't because I knew I had a protective role already. It didn't make sense for someone to throw that out there to me. Another point, I find is conspicious that CD has been really lax about mentioning IAI at all, despite the fact that IAI had been attacking him throughout most of D1. That doesn't look like a town-town relationship to me, but, rather, either scum-scum or scum-town.  Check out <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6091486#p6091486\">906</a> where he tries to throw dirt on my BG claim. Him and Drew try and tag team me and get me lynched post-claim. Also, I have no idea how a BG claim is \"easy\" for scum to fake? Maybe we could ask IAI how it's \"easy\" for me to fake my own death? A doctor is an easy claim to fake, because the scum could always NK if they need to. Remember this is what IAI was angling to do before I called him out. I also want to point out, just so that I am on the record for this and you know this, I wanted IAI lynched yesterday (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6093040#p6093040\">957</a>), but I realized it would be foolish to try and pivot the wagon that late in the day. Three other quick points against IAI: <br>\n<br>\n1) IAI was coming after me for voting CD as opposed to Drew yesterday saying that I flipped my townread on CD. That was a misrepresentation as I explained in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6095264#p6095264\">1106</a>. IAI wanted to know if I would vote CD specifically as a counterwagon to reinoe prior to reinoe's claim. Under those specific conditions, I did not want to vote CD. But after reinoe's claim and the (rightful) collapse of his wagon, CD was no longer a counterwagon to reinoe because reinoe wasn't a viable wagon any longer, do you follow me? <br>\n2) IAI contradicts himself in his own post, calling CD town and then asking players to vote for him in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6095360#p6095360\">1112</a>.<br>\n3) IAI's contention that him not voting reinoe or Drew during D1 in post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6103346#p6103346\">1177</a> is hardly convincing at all. I elaborate as to why in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6103398#p6103398\">1191</a>, but the short of it is that IAI is on record as saying he would vote Drew.

She is being selective and narrow minded in her scope - also, not that when I first called her out on meta (something she admitted to not doing) her first reaction was a sudden lash out at me - when literally all I had done was ask if she'd done that research. Then she does the research and - shock of shocks - finds evidence to support her claim...until you actually start looking at the evidence and asking questions. Also, note her attitude towards IAI as compared to Pops and then compare the cases. Even Sleepy the tunnel king actually feels comfortable admitting that he scum reads both - as well he should since they've done the same stuff. But Farside acts surprised I even have that conclusion - while still sticking to her guns that it is Pops, not IAI, who looks scummy...for reasons...<br>\n<br>\nThat doesn't make you nervy about her?<br>\n<br>\nIt makes me nervy as hell - what have you figured out from trying to understand her?", "time": "Fri Aug 22, 2014 6:48 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=58515&start=1650", "forum": "53", "thread": "58515"}

Frankly, bodyguard always sort of struck me as a dumb role, really. Like, if I was scum and someone was a bodyguard it's like 'meh, who cares?'

You're applying a black/white method to my scumhunting that I don't think holds water unless you think I'm very robotic in how I get my reads - and I don't think I should come across that way at all and am annoyed at needing to defend that I don't scumhunt via absolutes held in isolation from other info - I would tend to suggest that you look at any of my town games and see if I come off that sort of robotic to you.

This leaves four other possibilities: IAI, SK, Bob and SG.<br>\n<br>\nAlthough it's possible, I don't think she tracked IAI. If she did, she was really making a gamble not to claim that she had role information that told her IAI did not go anywhere over night. Granted, IAI would likely not have made the kill were he scum, and farside's defense of IAI was strangely elevated over the course of the game, but if she believed she had a BG, she should've claimed that she had role information that told her IAI was likely innocent. I'd have protected her last night and she'd have gotten at least one more report. Then again, maybe I play more conservatively than she does. In any case, I don't think she went this direction, but it's certainly possible.<br>\n<br>\nI contend she would not have investigated SK. Despite them butting heads a bit, I think farside maintained a pretty strong townread on him most of the game (see: <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6079047#p6079047\">697</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6109444#p6109444\">1249</a>).<br>\n<br>\nCyberbob is probably slightly more possible than SK, but she also maintained a townread on him despite butting heads with him as well (see: <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6079189#p6079189\">736</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6095116#p6095116\">1103</a>).<br>\n<br>\nWith SG, remember that she voted Konowa early on D1 in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6048355#p6048355\">63</a>. She didn't remove this until <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6066989#p6066989\">490</a>, but once she did, she almost immediately went back to Konowa (at this point Beck) in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6068055#p6068055\">505</a>. She still had Beck as her top scumread in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6069521#p6069521\">570</a> and she finally switched off for the last time in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6069772#p6069772\">581</a>. After this she mentions Beck a few times, but kind of in an inconclusive manner. It's hard to tell what she thinks of Beck in the second half of D1. The banter is neutral and she's clearly holding him at a distance. Her first mention of Beck on D2 is in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6103430#p6103430\">1198</a> when she is asking Beck for his opinion on me vs IAI. This seems to indicate to me that she is now leaning town on Beck, which is quite a departure from what she was doing on D1. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6107646#p6107646\">1236</a> is another example of farside acting kind of pally with Beck as they are both working together for a CD lynch. She later says that she sees Beck/pops as a scum pair, but the thing that sort of has me doubting an SG track though is SG's entry into the game. Once SG enters into the game, farside and SG seem to go at it. farside's now infamous <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6141017#p6141017\">1800</a> is all you need to see to know how she ultimately was feeling about this slot on D2 once SG stepped in. <br>\n<br>\nAnyway, maybe this was all for naught, as I'm kind of just as lost as I was when I originally skimmed though. I think the four main possibilies are that she either tracked IAI, SK, Cyberbob or SG. All of these are reasonable, but they all also have things that suggest she didn't track that person. The likelihood of them is probably IAI &gt; SG &gt; Bob &gt; SK. Whomever she tracked, she got no result. Going forward, I'm going to assume I have an innocent track on all three of these players and take it into account tomorrow.", "time": "Sat Aug 30, 2014 2:34 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=58515&start=1975", "forum": "53", "thread": "58515"}

I've also had a consistent townread of Bob throughout this game. Uh, some of his emotional posts ring as genuine townie frustration... let me pull a couple of examples, because there's plenty when he was exchanging with farside. I don't think these exchanges were hostile either, it seemed like Bob went out of his way to try and understand/work with farside in such a way that he didn't necessarily need to if he was scum. Here are a few posts that reference this: <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6078713#p6078713\">681</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6079066#p6079066\">703</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6079093#p6079093\">711</a> and especially <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6079162#p6079162\">730</a>. There are many others.<br>\n<br>\nWith SG, I'm convinced we're kind of in the same boat in that both of us were really wrong about IAI and wanting to atone for that. I alluded to as much yesterday, but I've yet to see anything really convincing be brought against SG since she's replaced in. Additionally, and singer may not realize this, but pops was very much trying to push a Konowa wagon from the start of the game. I can refresh people's memories by giving links to posts <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6048703#p6048703\">69</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6050930#p6050930\">101</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6055255#p6055255\">196</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6086062#p6086062\">833</a>. He could be bussing, but pops doesn't really strike me as the type of player that's interesting in bussing given that SG and myself were the only two people he voted that haven't flipped town (and I know I'm town but he only voted me for, like, 20 posts anyway). If someone can prove me wrong with some meta, then I'd be willing to listen to it, but it doesn't really sit well with me. <br>\n<br>\nGoofy, eh, although I think he's maybe slipped a touch from where I was with him earlier in this game, there's something so transparently townie about him. I know one or two of you picked on me earlier (I think it was Drew or IAI or both, come to think of it), but Goofy's posting style speaks to me. He's just... so sure of himself. He says what he feels like and comes across as fearless. I can give examples of this, but nearly every Goofy post is like this. He's succinct and always seems to post at the right times.<br>\n<br>\nsinger is the odd (wo)man out here. CD always had a weird relationship with pops (see: <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6093114#p6093114\">960</a>/<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6093455#p6093455\">975</a>). CD had a weird relationship with a lot of people though (myself included). I remember farside arguing with me pretty hard about wanting to lynch CD. One final thing about CD that's especially damning for singer today? And the one thing you should seriously consider if you don't read another thing I have to right? CD was brought to L-1 in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6090902#p6090902\">886</a>, and guess who breaks the momentum for a CD wagon that he wasn't voting? pops in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6091151#p6091151\">893</a>. Once pops joined Drew in voting me, farside, IAI and Cyberbob followed in quick unison, effectively killing the CD wagon for the rest of the day. As far as I know, CD is the only living player that was brought to L-1 and had his wagon fall apart. And the person that orchestrated that was pops for the most part (farside had her hand in it, too, but she wouldn't have jumped if pops didn't do so first).<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: singersinger</span><br>\n<br>\nI protected Goofy this go around as his vote on pops seemed the most genuine to me.

CD was not thought of as widely town for most of this game. Not by IAI, not by Drew, not by SK, not by farside. I went to bat for him for a time, but I have backed off from that position and have remained backed off from that position (and I caught a lot of flak for doing this!). Ironically, I think Cyberbob was one of the few players that genuinely did not want to lynch him and fought fiercely against that. I don't know where he stands now (although his vote certainly gives us a clue), but suffice it to say that CD didn't have too many fans, and I just haven't been turned around on this slot by singer's play. She's played adequate, but there's only so far her, \"I was right about pops; I must be town\" can get her in my mind. I've said this before to IAI, but that argument doesn't really hold much water for me given that I was wrong about pops and know I'm town. <br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>SG 2028 wrote:</cite>Because my scum plan was to come in, defend my scumbuddy super hard on one day, and then immediately bus them the next day invalidating what I fought for all th eprevious day?</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nThis is WIFOMy, which I tend to be allergic to, but it's a fair point nonetheless.

Otherwise give us a solid point or two tying Cyberbob to pops. At first I thought the case could be made, but after going back through the game a bit, I'm not as willing to go this route today.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>SG 2028 wrote:</cite>The thing is I can't help but note that Cyber is there too.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nHe is, yes, but by the time he joined, it was kind of a free-for-all. To be fair, as I mentioned earlier in this post, I recall Cyberbob not wanting to lynch CD on D1 and being so-so on the prospect of lynching me. Unlike pops and farside, both of which went out of their way to deflate the CD wagon, Cyberbob never purported to want the CD wagon to succeed. Either of you can correct me if I am wrong about any of this. <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>SG 2028 wrote:</cite>How do you explain Singer's move on Pops though? You call Cyber's 'organic' or whatever, but Singer looked pretty focused to me. i think she was literally the first person (maybe it was Farside though) who basically whined that I was defending Pops. That seems like a pretty focused town tunnel rather than a bus, no?</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nHonestly, I didn't much care for singer's move to pops on D2. The main reason being her wishy-washiness as she came into the game. In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6119491#p6119491\">1372</a> she says she's going to vote IAI. In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6119927#p6119927\">1375</a>, she reaffirms that she's going to vote IAI and explains this to farside. After her and farside go at each other a bit (in fairness to singer, she claimed to have a farside townread early on), she recants in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6123306#p6123306\">1407</a>, essentially saying she \"mixed the names up\", and slowly starts to pivot toward pops. So, I mean, how do I explain it? I explain it by saying that she came into the game, stuck her finger in the air to see if she could get on the IAI wagon without too much resistance, caught some heavy resistance from farside and SK, and immediately moved to pops. I think she thought that if she didn't find a way to move to pops, farside and SK may have turned their attention toward her more heavily once again, and she thought the scumteam would be better served with her around rather than pops (especially if she got the credit for voting him). <br>\n<br>\nI think farside was the one from the very start that tied you together with pops, and she did that from very, very early on in the game. She touched on it a handful of times. At some point singer took that ball and ran with it. I don't know if she brought anything new to the argument. It seems to me like the biggest argument in favor of you two being a scumteam is the IAI wagon, but, again, that doesn't really sell me in that I genuinely thought IAI was a better scum candidate than pops was. So, it's like, I can understand the viewpoint of another townie thinking that. I also appreciate that you came into the game and were willing to speak your mind in an unpopular way from the footing of a slot that wasn't very strong (I'd say the Konowa/Beck slot was about on par with the CD slot in terms of dislike, all things considered). singer didn't really do this, I don't think. Maybe she's more pensive personality-wise, but I don't think so. I think she was very, very careful in her entrance to this game and tried hard to \"fit in\" how she was supposed to as town. <br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>singer 2029 wrote:</cite>Why go for a VT with a claimed BG out there...</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nAre you saying this because no one else has said it for you yet?<br>\n<br>\nI mean, I see the point, but on the other hand I don't see my role as much of a threat, especially in a room full of VTs (which I am assuming given the lack of any night actions and the deaths we've had already).

I don't think I am insulting your scum game here, I just think you took a calculated risk that was transparent (as you claim to be) in retrospect. Namely, that you wanted to feel out how the game would react if you were to try and sneak aboard the IAI wagon, immediately caught heat for that, and then jumped aboard with the pops trio (farside, Goofy and SK) as quick as you could. <br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>SG 2053 wrote:</cite>the cases were identical.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nI don't understand what you mean by this.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>SG 2053 wrote:</cite>There was never a Cyberbob supported killed that I can find</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nAgain, I'm kind of confused as to what this means.

IAI was town and pops was scum. singer came into this game and thought she could join the IAI wagon without getting herself into the spotlight for doing so. farside immediately started throwing accusations her way and she thought it wasn't worth the trouble to fight for an IAI lynch when she could get in good graces with her townread farside and get credit for bussing a lame goon. pops' self-vote yesterday was especially good evidence as to the fact that pops was onboard with using himself as bait for his scumbuddies to get credit off of. <br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>singer 2058 wrote:</cite>These sequential sentences are very contradictory to me...<br>\n<br>\nIf the lynch isn't as obvious as yesterday, then why did you vote already (in within your first few posts)...</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nI give credit where credit is due, and this is on point.

I could care less about Bob's position on my protections and his willingness or lackthereof to analyze that. I do care about him contradicting himself over something that should be easy to explain (how much time he spent on the game) as well as his quick vote contradicting his assertion that yesterday was more obvious than today.<br>\n<br>\nFurther, this post is kind of crappy also in the sense that singer scumhunting is not a scumtell.

I appreciate that you're busy or (if you're town) you're trying to give the game thought, but you need to get to work. As SG basically says in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6206671#p6206671\">2184</a>, your content is junk. Even if I grant you that you're right and there's only one scum left, you shouldn't be playing that way. You should be assuming that there are two scum left and be pleasantly surprised if that turns out to be wrong. I mean, it should be an afterthought that you throw into a post as a ancillary thing, this should not be the entirety of your content for today. You're being too academic and not nearly  analytical enough. If I don't see a vote, a case, or some serious responses to the discussions had between every other living player over these past ~7 pages in your next post, I will probably vote you. I am dead serious. You are really pinging my scumdar hard with these posts. If you want me to be more specific, just look at <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6205153#p6205153\">2177</a>. This post is horrid. Let me count the ways...<br>\n<br>\n1) The bitching at SG for \"not reading\" your posts is pointless. Is she scum for doing this? If no, then shrug it off and explain it to her again. If yes, then why don't you tell us this? This comment comes across as petty given the fact that SG has arguably spent more time getting fully vested in this game and trying to understand all the relationships as a replacement than any other living players. I'm not saying this to defend SG's honor or anything; I'm just upset that we're on page 88 and everyone has pretty much told you that we're waiting on you to give actual content and you're coming at us with this whiny, passive-aggressive \"SG read my posts before commenting please and thank you\". Maybe you didn't realize it, but it struck me as really stand-offish and elitist. It smacks of someone that is avoiding the real heart of the matter. <br>\n2) You're \"slightly leaning toward scum-Bob\". And why is this? Is this different from an opinion you had earlier today? Yesterday? The start of the game? Why or why not? Show your work. <br>\n3) \"but maybe...\" you undercut your \"slight\" scumread in the next few words. You already qualified your piss poor read by calling it slight (how you can have such minimal opinions of someone at this stage is beyond me, but leaving that aside...), but then you take it a step further and show more ineptitude by saying that you're not even sure if you actually have a slight scumread or not because it may be influenced by other people's cases. <br>\n4) You \"explicitly dislike\" some of the cases people have made against singer. This is news to me. Why is this the first time I am hearing of this? Why did you not say something when it happened? Are these players scum? <br>\n<br>\nI could go on, but I think you get the point.

We're at an impasse. I have worked very hard to read this game as objectively as I could and come up with the conclusions that I have. It's not my fault when I have you abandoning the singer wagon on one side and I have Dessew not giving us anything on the other side. It's hard to get a lynch with an even number of people like this anyway. If we have two scum, all four townies are going to have to come to an agreement to get one of them lynched.

{"number": 2234, "id": "6213597", "user": "Dessew", "user_id": "21864", "content": "Okay, so there are two distinct points.<br>\n1. It was originally posted by SK. The point is that if there were two three scum, the game could have ended jusr after two mislynches. It's quite straightforward.<br>\n2. It's a bit unorthodox. So the point is that I show that if there were three scum, the game wouldn't be balanced. I'll do this by comparing this game to a similar setup.<br>\nThere are going to be a few assumptions you might disagree with, so let's clear them up beforehand.<br>\na) All town PRs have been outed. It's actually kind of a crucial point, but since a killing and an informative role has already flipped, there's an unCC'd protective role, there's most likely a scum blocking role and btw, a miscellanious town role has flipped, too.<br>\nb) RC is town. I think he's been pretty townish and he's an unCC'd PR. But even if he was scum, it would just amplify my point. RC being town also means that there's a scum RB.<br>\nOkay, so we need a setup now. I won't link anything because I'm posting from my phone, but there's a thread called \"(Semi-) Open Design Challenge Finalists (Kids With Guns!)\" (please look at it, the OP is mith if it makes it easier for you to find it.) You can find several setups in the OP, the one created by Jackal is very similar to the one in this game. Jackal's setup (probably) went through a process (I don't know much about this whole challange stuff, tbh), so I take that it's balanced (and balance is objective &amp;c. all the stuff you hear.)<br>\nThen let's assume that we've got three scum after all. How does PF's game differ from Jackal's?<br>\nb) It's closed. Closedness buffs scum. For instance, in an open there would be no bright mind who wants to lynch an unCC'd BG.<br>\nb) There' some neighbour thing going on. Two town neighbours are obviously weak af, but you don't know my alignment, so let's consider a town-scum pairing, as well. Well, it's still not powerful, imo, there are some slip possibilities, of course, and if the scum dies earlier, the townie gets a bunch of towncred, but the advantages get overwhelmed by point c)<br>\nc) There's a Tracker instead of a Cop. Cops are one of the most powerful roles. Also, consider the usefulness of a Tracker with a Vig alive. Or a BG alive. It can receive false positives and false negatives. So adding point b and c together, town get nerfed to some extent.<br>\nd) One less player. It doesn't even need a comment.<br>\nSo if there were three scum, you could get PF's game by taking Jackal's and making it more scum-sided to a considerable extent. That's no balance, therefore there must be a two-player scum team.<br>\n<br>\n@singer: I meant that in that case for example if the roleblocker dies, scum loses the neighbour, too (as they are the same player.) And that situation might as well create a conftown, as well (see above.) In my experience scum PR are usuallyy spread out to avoid this kind of swing (for example when in one of my scumgames we had a GF, a RB and a Tracker, we were all given one role each, not like a GF-RB-Tracker and two MGs.)

If the setup were Mafia Neighbour RB + MG (+ Town), the death of the RB of be much more detrimental to scum than that of the Goon (so it's swingy.) Scum wouldn't just lose half of itself (remember, the whole thing starts as \"if there are two scum\"), they also lose all their PRs and the flipping Neighbour might create a conftown player (and there's a BG, so the town-Neighbour's gonna stay for quite a time.)

I'm not even sure wether you're trying to make a point here and if you should be, what the point is supposed to be.<br>\nOkay, so again. There are several measures that can describe a game, one of them is swinginess. The more swing a game has, the more difficult it is to predict beforehand what's going to happen in the game. For instance, Vigs are a perfect example of roles amplifying swinginess. The game is going to be seriously affected by who gets the Vig role. Another example is making an overly powerful combined role while not giving anything anyone else. And before I forget to add, you generally want to reduce swing below a certain level.<br>\nNow, you believe that a Neighbour RB + MG scumteam is reasonable. It isn't, though, that's what singer and I had an exchange about not so long ago if you remember. It was on the previous page.

In the future when i make posting obligations I plan to make them go 3 days instead of 2 and there won't be a force replace rule after so many prods.  Technically Red should have been force replaced for a 3rd violation but as I myself should have been here on time on 2 occassions and since I didn't want late game replacing to effect a direct outcome i decided not to enforce the rule there.  Mod actions should not directly effect an outcome.  As town still had an opportunity to vote and lynch red I feel my decision was ok though I don't generally like all the blantant prod dodging.  So I think increasing things to 3 and removing the force replace rule would be good for my future games.

A majority of votes is required to lynch. If there is a lynch, no amount of bitching will prevent the lynch from happening. I am a moderator, not a charity. <br>\n<br>\n03. When you live, live well. Live long. Prosper. When you're dead, shut up. Don't post in the games thread. Lie in a grave/furnace/corpse pile. Rot. <br>\n<br>\n04. All days have a 14 day deadline. All nights have a 48 hour deadline. The thread will lock during night given the nature of the game<br>\n<br>\n05. You can vote for no lynch to occur during the day. Simply post <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: No Lynch</span>. Should this vote reach a majority, it will happen. If no majority is reached during a day then there will be a no lynch when that day ends<br>\n<br>\n06. Quoting or faking any PMs you receive from the mod will get you modkilled and blacklisted from any games I am running now or in the future. You may paraphrase anything in the PM. If you are worried you are quoting more so then paraphrasing you should probably PM me before I modkill you<br>\n<br>\n07. Each player must post every 48 hours. If they do not, I will prod them. If they don't respond to the prod in Y days, then they will be replaced. If you have already received 2 prods and you go idle for 48 hours a 3rd time, I will force replace you. This rule will be temporarily ignored if you give V/la notice 2 days before going V/la. Anyone found to be faking V/la will be mod killed<br>\n<br>\n08. Don't talk to each other outside of the game thread unless your role says you can. If you disobey this rule, <div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">you will be modkilled or force replaced pending the severity of your actions</div><br>\n<br>\n09. No small or invisible text. Don&#8217;t edit/delete previously submitted posts if you have the power to do so<br>\n<br>\n10. This is a game. Have fun and respect the other players. Don't be a dick.<br>\n<br>\n11. If it seems like it should be illegal, it probably is. Considering the fact rules sometimes can't cover everything. Please use your common sense. PM me if you think something you are about to do could break the rules or possibly ruin the game. <br>\n<br>\n12. I am human. If I fuck up and make a mod error that personally looses you the game, then I will give you a technical auto win at the end of the game to make up for it <br>\n<br>\n13. I respect anonymity on the internet and in mafia. If there is a scum group with a QT, I will <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">NOT</div> be posting a link to it at the end of the game. It is that scum teams decision as to whether or not a link to their QT will be posted at the end of the game<br>\n<br>\n14. If I have to modkill a player, the following will occur. If that player was town, the day will immediately end as though they were the lynch. If that player was non-town the day will continue. Basically the worst case scenario will occur for their side. Please don't make me have to invoke this rule or any modkill related rules. I don't want to do it. I felt bad just writing this<br>\n<br>\n15. The game will start with a Pregame phase. During this phase, any roles with the power to night talk may talk. Pregame will last 48 hours, you must PM a confirm to me saying you received and understand your role during Pregame, or i will look to replace you during day 1<br>\n<br>\n16. If you have a night action and think you will be V/la during the night cycle, you can send the action to me in advance<br>\n<br>\n17. If you have a night action and have already sent a target for your action, you can change you target before the night is over by sending me a message with the new choice<br>\n<br>\n18. If you have a night action and forget to send me a choice, you get nothing.<br>\n<br>\n19. Posting in the game thread can be done during twilight by any living player including the person who was just lynched, up until the mod locks the thread<br>\n<br>\nVanilla Townie PM:<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>You are a <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vanilla Townie</div>.

That's one of a few reasons Sleepy died - he was at least shown to be able to lead compared to the other surviving town players. That then left town functionally leaderless except for a lurky RC and the kind of noisy Squirrel. Pretty much a perfect situation for scum (and that by early into the game day we were debating between two town lynches [one started by RC and the other by me] pretty much showed how that ability to push wagons really handed us the win at that stage).<br>\n<br>\nI think you need to be more of a presence throughout the game if you want to be able to lead wagons.

Both games have a primary goal you can realize in an unstant: lose your cards / get the strongest possible hand. But in order to get any good at them you must improve other cometences: paying attention to the others' cards / manipulating the opponents.
