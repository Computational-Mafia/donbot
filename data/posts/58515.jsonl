I reserve the right to edit these rules at any time should something truly unexpected occur.<br><br>01. All votes must be made bold or made using the vote tag. Unvoting is not required but I heavily prefer it. Any attempts at disguising your voting will be prohibited. If its treated as a vote and I think its a vote, its a a vote!<br><br>02. A majority of votes is required to lynch. If there is a lynch, no amount of bitching will prevent the lynch from happening. I am a moderator, not a charity. <br><br>03. When you live, live well. Live long. Prosper. When you're dead, shut up. Don't post in the games thread. Lie in a grave/furnace/corpse pile. Rot. <br><br>04. All days have a 14 day deadline. All nights have a 48 hour deadline. The thread will lock during night given the nature of the game<br><br>05. You can vote for no lynch to occur during the day. Simply post <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: No Lynch</span>. Should this vote reach a majority, it will happen. If no majority is reached during a day then there will be a no lynch when that day ends<br><br>06. Quoting or faking any PMs you receive from the mod will get you modkilled and blacklisted from any games I am running now or in the future. You may paraphrase anything in the PM. If you are worried you are quoting more so then paraphrasing you should probably PM me before I modkill you<br><br>07. Each player must post every 48 hours. If they do not, I will prod them. If they don't respond to the prod in 2 days, then they will be replaced. If you have already received 2 prods and you go idle for 48 hours a 3rd time, I will force replace you. This rule will be temporarily ignored if you give V/la notice 2 days before going V/la. Anyone found to be faking V/la will be mod killed<br><br>08. Don't talk to each other outside of the game thread unless your role says you can. If you disobey this rule, you will be modkilled or force replaced pending the severity of your actions<br><br>09. No small or invisible text. Don\u2019t edit/delete previously submitted posts if you have the power to do so<br><br>10. This is a game. Have fun and respect the other players. <br><br>11. If it seems like it should be illegal, it probably is. Considering the fact rules sometimes can't cover everything. Please use your common sense. PM me if you think something you are about to do could break the rules or possibly ruin the game. <br><br>12. I am human. If I fuck up and make a mod error that personally looses you the game, then I will give you a technical auto win at the end of the game to make up for it <br><br>13. I respect anonymity on the internet and in mafia. If there is a scum group with a quick topic or private topic, I will <span class=\"noboldsig\">NOT</span> be posting a link to it at the end of the game. It is that scum teams decision as to whether or not a link to their quick topic or private topic will be posted at the end of the game<br><br>14. If I have to modkill a player, the following will occur. If that player was town, the day will immediately end as though they were the lynch. If that player was non-town the day will continue. Basically the worst case scenario will occur for their side. Please don't make me have to invoke this rule or any modkill related rules. I don't want to do it, I felt bad just writing them<br><br>15. The game will start with a Pregame phase. During this phase, any roles with the power to night talk may talk. Pregame will last 48 hours, you must PM a confirm to me saying you received and understand your role during Pregame, or i will look to replace you during day 1<br><br>16. If you have a night action and think you will be V/la during the night cycle, you can send the action to me in advance<br><br>17. If you have a night action and have already sent a target for your action, you can change your target before the night is over by sending me a message with the new choice<br><br>18. If you have a night action and forget to send me a choice, you get nothing.<br><br>19. Posting in the game thread can be done during twilight by any living player including the person who was just lynched, up until the mod locks the thread<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">20: If you ask for a player to be prodded and this player posts before I send him the prod, it does not count as one of their allowed prods. I got to send it to them for it to count.  I'll send them \"I'm replacing you\" in the 3rd message.  This message must be sent before I replace them.  Once its sent, no matter of posting will stop it.  I plan to send this same message when a player doesn't answer/post after an allowed prod and the same rules will apply there.  Once I say \"I'm replacing you\" it will happen</span><br><br>Vanilla Townie PM:<br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>You are a <span class=\"noboldsig\">Vanilla Townie</span>.  You have no night actions.  Use your vote during the day to help lynch all non-town players.  You win when all non-town players have been eliminated.  You do not have to be alive in order to win.  Good luck</div></blockquote>"}

You overreacted to my \"Claim Jumper\" comment.  Someone with your experience should know by now that people do reaction testing via votes.  <br><br>Your approach to the game is different from mine to begin with because you feel that people should vote whom they think is scum.  I've gone for as long as 7 pages without being sure of whom is scum but I've still managed to place \"serious votes\" before then.  However you questioned farside for NOT VOTING which made me wonder in light of my previous comment about how sometimes it takes a long time to vote for scum.  This seemed like fakescumhunting to me so I \"serious\" voted you.<br><br>Also you say that your playstyle is \"off-beat\" but then you start taking my off-beat playstyle so seriously.  If your style is \"offbeat\" then you should be able to recognize another \"offbeat\" style and be able to better read or at least understand it.  In light of your lack of empathy for a playstyle that's similar to yours suggests that you claimed to have an off-beat style just to deflect any future awkwardness.<br><br><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot#Knot_tying\" class=\"postlink\">What kind of Knot do you prefer with your noose?</a>"}

That 'hypocrisy off-beat playstyle hypocrisy off-beat' thing is being stretched beyond belief too. Could be inexperienced and overeager town I guess but IMO the best way to differentiate between shit town and scum is to see how they react under pressure.

This is similar to Drew going to bat for SK, although this is less subtle. farside, this implies that you either read Goofy as town, read SK as scum, or both, yeah? Bob also mentioned that he read this as a chainsaw defense of reinoe, and I can agree with that interpretation as well. <br><br>Anyway, the question is, why is SK getting under your skin, as this post seems to indicate? <br><br>---<br><br>@pops, still waiting for an answer:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>RC 75 wrote:</cite>I kind of agree with this.

I just got out of a game with townreinoe recently, and the difference between his play there and his play here as been night and day so far. I don't mean for this to come across as cruel, but his humor just isn't very funny either. As Bob says here, it's more annoying and even offputting than it is contributing anything to the overall game. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6049316#p6049316\">89</a> is a good example of this. <br><br>The posts he's making come across as forced, overdone and as thought they're nervous responses to the things SK is saying. I don't even think SK's case is particularly strong (Bob's point against reinoe, as I've stated before, is much better and more succinct), but reinoe has really been reacting to it badly. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Bob 99 wrote:</cite>He's barely made any case at all against you aside from asking questions which have mostly either gone unanswered or have been answered by other people.

His Konowa vote in particular sullies the wagon on Konowa and has me thinking that Konowa is town. I mean, he kind of has a blanket scumread on several people here (Dessew, CD, Goofy myself, SK, reinoe and IAI), but he chooses Konowa to vote? The only people he seems comfortable calling a townread is farside, which is absurd.

He is, in fact, simply appearing like he's not lurking by posting dribble. <br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Also, in regards to your SK comment.

Your assumption. Not truth. The fact I clearly state my reads and you've completely misrepresented me in them is very much on show.

This is what Reinoe is suggesting - that you're either bussing or distancing (or both). <br><br>Skrew keeping off RC (or not following through with his thoughts on it) for what I consider insufficient reasons is, in my mind, not pro-town.

Neg town is, in my view, acting in a way that is not in towns best interests. Again, intent is important.

Especially since he never mentioned that the first set was scumreads and the second wasn't, even when asked what the point of the bracket lists was.<br>Also of note that initially, reinoe said I had multiple erroneous assumptions, but when pressed could only come up with one.<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6063079#p6063079\" class=\"postlink\">post 295</a>, reinoe wrote:</cite>Now the next part is your misrepresentation.  <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6061674#p6061674\" class=\"postlink\">post 268</a>, reinoe wrote:</cite><br><blockquote><div><cite>RedCoyote wrote:</cite>EBWOP: I <strike>take</strike> agreed with Bob's argument against you</div></blockquote><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6061626#p6061626\" class=\"postlink\">post 266</a>, RedCoyote wrote:</cite>How convenient that is for you. <br></div></blockquote><br>So you don't even have an argument of your own.

You'll notice Konowa in there.  Now farside NEVER EXPLAINS HER SCUMREAD ON KONOWA.  Not ever.  Look through here ISO if you don't believe me.  Now read my 268.  Read it carefully.  Take your time.  Now you see how the thing I mentioned is that RedCoyote is sheeping AN ARGUMENT SOMEONE ELSE POSTED?  I am not accusing RedCoyote of sheeping a vote.  Those are two different things.  Since farside has never posted an argument for her scumread it would be impossible for me to be sheeping her reason except under one condition...You're accusing farside and I of talking about this game outside of this forum.  Is that what you're doing?  Are you accusing farside and I of cheating?

Then he calls sheeping an argument scummy, which is just stupid. Then he goes on a fantastical tangent about me supposedly accusing him and you (farside) of cheating, which is just unnecessary noise and bullshit. He continues on by saying that sheeping a vote is okay to do (remember, sheeping an argument is not!). I don't like his point 1 here on a gut level (this is probably me stretching but idrc). If he isn't sheeping your vote, then I don't think he should care enough about it to put it in the finale of the argument. But I can understand why you'd disagree, and it really isn't that important. This is still all bullshit.<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6063079#p6063079\" class=\"postlink\">post 295</a>, reinoe wrote:</cite>Lastly is your hyperbole.  <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>SleepyKrew wrote:</cite> Basically, he didn't think his lie through. </div></blockquote><br>This is over the top here.

I think he's town and we're looking to mislynch based on faulty argument. Why wouldn't I defend him? [/quote]<br>Because you are doing the work of someone else when we are trying to figure out if he is scum or not. You are basically letting him sit back and post <span style=\"font-style: italic\">shit</span> instead of anything else. You are interfering with the town's interrogation. Secondly the reason why you think town cases are good is pretty damn stupid in my honest opinion. You are literally giving away the only secret information you have to the scum. You are using a tactic that has been empirically proven to fail (this was discovered years ago, btw). And to compound it all, you are wrong on reino.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>No, it is an invalid approach. It doesn't work. That is why people don't do it. People have tried. They have failed. </div></blockquote><br><br>Sure. But let me ask you something - if you have 6 people, and a cop has investigated two to find town, you can by PoE move the chances of hitting scum from 1 / 6 to 1 / 3 - that is process of elimination. Doing it without cop assistance is far more prone to error but a cop, in essence, is attempting to find scum but when they find town is performing PoE. <br><br>So no - it is not ultimately flawed, but it is risky. And legitimate. [/quote]<br>no, it 100% flawed and you should know better. The reason it is 100% flawed is that the narrowing down process has ALREADY BEEN DONE. PEOPLE HAVE TOWN READS THEY JUST DON'T TELL YOU. Why don't they tell, you may ask. Well because the fucking cop is one of them. Scum sees that shit and are like, \"well, this guy isn't going to get lynched tomorrow because everyone thinks he is town.\" And so then you end up diluting the lynch pool because lynching that scummy player is offset by the NK on your cop friend. <br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I disagree here.

Not that there is anything wrong with it, but that is a fact.<br>2) You are probably scum because pretty much the only reason I could see to defend reinoe at this point is if he was your buddy.<br>3) Meta is bullshit. I'm not looking up your other games because in all likelihood the reason why you brought it up is because this is the time that you drew scum and your self-constructed \"defending other people\" meta is starting to pay off now that you drew scum.<br>4) not as much as you because she isn't a personal attack dog.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6069342#p6069342\" class=\"postlink\">post 531</a>, reinoe wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>SleepyKrew wrote:</cite>reinoe, give me your reads please.</div></blockquote><br>1) Nope.

His posts are overall collected and they have a purpose. Example: his stance on the reinoe-SK debate. The whole thing became a mere penis measurement competition, imo, I mean the only actual substance that could be sqeezed out of it appeared just recently. (Reinoe, you should really explain how we were supposed to find out whom you're scumreading from those lists.)

I understand that for you when you play mafia it is like one huge game where every thing in one game carries over to another, but for me every game is completely and totally independent (except for set-up related strategy). The logic of why in this specific case defending someone hard is scummy stands on its own two legs. It doesn't need an independent example. <br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6078617#p6078617\" class=\"postlink\">post 680</a>, SleepyKrew wrote:</cite>I'm not concealing scumreads...

Yeah, not wise to go down that road unless some others face pressure too, and information is had. Information that is the name of the game.<br><br>I pushed your wagon. Someone said they'd be okay with that, but didn't join. Nobody else followed me. That told me lots.<br><br>The Cooldog wagon is at 3, but so much resistance, including yourself. Trying to shoot down the wagon before it gains more steam, and attacks on the main driver of that wagon (farside) right now. That tells me alot too.<br><br>I want to see who will vote for you guys, and who won't. That is information I want. And personally, if one of the two you got lynched today, I'd be ecstatic.

All I did was give out my scumreads at the moment and you and reinoe (and farside, too, later in the game) jumped on me for trying to call the whole scumteam. The point is so asinine that I'm upset with having to even \"2+2=4\" thing for you. It makes me think you're just throwing whatever at me until you think something sticks. It's also a waste of time to continually have to rebutt these little, nonsensical points and it drains me mentally to have to do so, which you may very well be trying to use to your advantage.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Drew 526 wrote:</cite>So why not wait until I came back from V/LA to ask me questions before the vote?</div></blockquote><br><br>Because reasonable townies don't get frightened over having one or two votes on them on D1.

Are you really still caught up on the idea that Goofy is scum because he was giving SK the business. I mean, that's really how much you've put into reading this game?

You ought to invest more time in understanding where I am coming from rather than just parrot Drew's poor \"gotcha\" point. <br><br>Because I thought the players in the game were mature enough to have an open discussion about scum and town reads, I (mistakenly, I realize now) tried to be very open about my scumreads. I speculated out loud that if I had to pick, my scum team would consist of Drew/reinoe and one of pops, Dessew or you. I just wanted to illustrate where I was at that point in time as I tend to do as town. I'm a firm believer in being completely open and honest as town about where I stand at all times. <br><br>In this game, however, I'm inclined to break that tradition. Like SK and reinoe, I don't think I will continue to be open about my reads. I think I will keep them hidden and only tunnel on one player lest farside, Drew or reinoe try to attack me for illogical reads. <br><br>farside, no duh calling the entire scumteam is going to be silly and probably inaccurate on D1. I haven't seen a flip yet. I haven't seen any powers yet... etc. <br><br>Heart-to-heart on this one, hon, I think you're either really offbase or scum.

CD said that. I didn't bother with it because I wanted reinoe dead. After reinoe claimed, I went back over it and saw that you made a couple of good points.

That post was made before reinoe claimed. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>pops 893 wrote:</cite>People were actually posting a bit productively around that time</div></blockquote><br><br>No, forcing Cyberbob/Drew to either hammer CD or push for another wagon would've been productive. You and farside threw that opportunity out the window.

As far as the call for the day to end, my heart understands just wanting to put this abortion of a day to bed but my head doesn't think that the reasoning against CD remotely warrants such an explicit fast lynch (this sentence is terrible but fuck it I can't be bothered rewriting it, hopefully people can read it).</div></blockquote><br><br>Fast lynch? We have a day and change left. CD has claimed. No other wagon is gaining momentum. reinoe (our closest thing to being confirmed town on D1) is leading the lynch. How close to the wire do you want to cut it? I'm not opportunistically whipping votes; I'm prudently calling for a close to the day.<br><br>Also, in response to the buddying thing, I lumped you and Drew in that post.

Hoping for someone to hammer me without a claim or what? <br><br>You're only upset because I claimed a protective role before you had a chance to fake it at some point later on in the game under the guise of, \"I was fishing for a doctor to throw the scum off!\"<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>IAI 908 wrote:</cite>(Which reminds me, RC DID YOU LEAVE A CRUMB ANYWHERE?)</div></blockquote><br><br>No, I didn't.

I've said this twice already. I'm also willing to concede that I'm possibly letting Drew's attitude influence me negatively. <br><br>---<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Cyberbob 919 wrote:</cite>Saying something dumb and wrong just to try and spring some kind of AHA YOU'RE ROLEFISHING trap on someone when they point out that you are wrong is a questionable tactic at best I would have thought</div></blockquote><br><br>What's ironic is IAI was the one originally rolefishing here. He has since accused both you and me of doing it.<br><br>---<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>pops 929 wrote:</cite>I don't think there's time for an IAI lynch though.</div></blockquote><br><br>IAI is far and away the best lynch today, but I'm not a crazy person that tries to wagon as many people as possible with the hopes of one of them copping to being scum. The best D1 95% of the time is to lynch a non-PR claimed person that a large portion of the game agrees could be scum. Then the next day you analyze what happens overnight along with the wagons of yesterday (especially the lynch wagon). And you repeat that process until the game is over. I don't know where this idea came from that people can't compromise on D1, especially a 35+ page D1, and go at it the next day armed with tons of new information.<br><br>---<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>SK 949 wrote:</cite>This reads like setting up an RC mislynch to win the game.

First off, you were effectively missing for the first half of this game, whining about CD when it wasn't relevant to anything. Then, when CD became relevant, you conspicuously abandoned it in favor of voting for a non-CC'd protective role that can be proven. Second, you were supposedly \"willing to switch to Drew\" <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6084371#p6084371\">799</a> (presumably if he didn't go for your sinister bidding), you can't turn around and say that not voting him makes you this town saint. Third, what the heck is wrong with town voting town on D1 of all days? As reinoe said, being wrong isn't a scumtell. If anything, it shows that you're considering opinions that aren't your own and critically thinking.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>IAI 1178 wrote:</cite>How is that obtuse? If any wagon late in the day pops up on any of these players, would you not consider them for a lynch?</div></blockquote><br><br>You assuming that my scumread on you and my scumread on, for instance, Dessew (a player I made it a point to explain my read on) are equivalent is you being obtuse. No, they are not the same. It's quite clear that you are far and away at the top of that, and I'm going to press for your head before any of the others. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>IAI 1179 wrote:</cite>RC, I know your lazy/OMGUS'ing, but me, pops, and Farside were not on that Reinoe wagon of 5. Neither was beck or dessew.<br><br>So 5 of ur 6 scum reads are not on the wagon...do u really think Beck or Dessew could be the last scum and that none of the 3 scum were on that Reinoe wagon?</div></blockquote><br><br>How can I OMGUS a player that isn't voting me...? <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif\" alt=\":?\" title=\"Confused\"><br><br>This is a fair point, however. But you have to understand that I'm town and I suspect reinoe, so there's already bias inherent in that. Further, I'm more than willing to alter my reads based on flips. It seems like I had to tell Drew that 5 times, but I guess I'm going to have to be prepared to state it 5 more times. I obviously don't know if that prediction is going to be accurate. It's what I think right now, however.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>IAI 1180 wrote:</cite>And where do you think most scum would go \"If he had claimed vig\"?

To answer your question, however, is to ask you why you'd presume to know what I'd do as scum in the first place? Further, my point was that there are things you need to hold your nose and swallow as town, all differences aside. I contend that Drew couldn't do that, hence why I was telling Dessew that calling him trollish is pretty accurate."}

Why do you have the groups you do as scum together?</div></blockquote><br><br>Current scumreads. <br><br>In regards to IAI, check out <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6078931#p6078931\">689</a> where he fishes for a doctor claim. This caught my eye immediately because it looked as though he was trying to breadcrumb being a protective role here. He mentions doctor out of nowhere, and the statement is awkward. All he needed to say was that you were his biggest townread. It would then be assumed that he would think you were worthy of a doc protection in his eyes. You may have missed it on the first go around, but I didn't because I knew I had a protective role already. It didn't make sense for someone to throw that out there to me. Another point, I find is conspicious that CD has been really lax about mentioning IAI at all, despite the fact that IAI had been attacking him throughout most of D1. That doesn't look like a town-town relationship to me, but, rather, either scum-scum or scum-town.  Check out <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6091486#p6091486\">906</a> where he tries to throw dirt on my BG claim. Him and Drew try and tag team me and get me lynched post-claim. Also, I have no idea how a BG claim is \"easy\" for scum to fake? Maybe we could ask IAI how it's \"easy\" for me to fake my own death? A doctor is an easy claim to fake, because the scum could always NK if they need to. Remember this is what IAI was angling to do before I called him out. I also want to point out, just so that I am on the record for this and you know this, I wanted IAI lynched yesterday (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6093040#p6093040\">957</a>), but I realized it would be foolish to try and pivot the wagon that late in the day. Three other quick points against IAI: <br><br>1) IAI was coming after me for voting CD as opposed to Drew yesterday saying that I flipped my townread on CD. That was a misrepresentation as I explained in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6095264#p6095264\">1106</a>. IAI wanted to know if I would vote CD specifically as a counterwagon to reinoe prior to reinoe's claim. Under those specific conditions, I did not want to vote CD. But after reinoe's claim and the (rightful) collapse of his wagon, CD was no longer a counterwagon to reinoe because reinoe wasn't a viable wagon any longer, do you follow me? <br>2) IAI contradicts himself in his own post, calling CD town and then asking players to vote for him in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6095360#p6095360\">1112</a>.<br>3) IAI's contention that him not voting reinoe or Drew during D1 in post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6103346#p6103346\">1177</a> is hardly convincing at all. I elaborate as to why in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6103398#p6103398\">1191</a>, but the short of it is that IAI is on record as saying he would vote Drew. It's nonsensical for him to turn right around and claim that him never voting Drew makes him town... he offered to do so!<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>farside 1205 wrote:</cite>I don't see why iai as scum would continue targeting the claim bg. There wasn't a cc and there is typically the chance of scum rb.</div></blockquote><br><br>As is evidence by his vote on Cyberbob, he has since stopped targeting me.

That's the criteria, okay? He qualified that statement and he's now omitting the qualifier to paint me in a certain light. In the universe where reinoe is my top scumread and hasn't claimed, I absolutely would never join IAI on a CD counter wagon. In the universe where reinoe is no longer my top scumread and has claimed, I absolutely could conceivably vote CD. But it's no longer a counter wagon to reinoe. Do you follow me?<br><br>SK, IAI and Drew are both adept at twisting words around. They overplayed their hand here because they thought the could lynch me even after I claimed. They got greedy.

It only took like three posts to finally goad you into it!\"<br><br>Please don't act like you goaded me into a vote. I suspected you all of D1, and the beginning of D2. My reason for picking you over RC is that with Reinoe dying, it makes his claim more believable. If there was a \"real\" protective role, they would have targeted Reinoe. But it didn't happen, which means a bodyguard is more likely. And a bodyguard does line up better with a town vig (bodyguard could save scum in this situation, if that's who both they and the vig target). So yeah, nice try on trying to discredit my vote.

That is lazy scumhunting...or fake scumhunting. I think you and I both know which. Funny thing is, you said I was scared to start a wagon on you D2...do you know who started the wagon on cooldog? Look it up, it was me. And I didn't move for the longest time. Funny connection you're trying to force there. Esp when D1 ended, and I was saying to everybody, vote cooldog over drew, VT claim over unknown one. Weird way to treat a scummate. Nice try buddy...  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif\" alt=\":roll:\" title=\"Rolling Eyes\"> <br><br>Cyberbob's 1204 \"(Also I believe I had CD as more of a null read for most of yesterday than a town read)\"<br><br>Yep, you voted the confirmed town vig while I voted CD. Once again, bad argument on your part.<br><br>Sleepykrew's 1210 \"What happens if Drew claims? He moves to CD and we'd still have needed two more votes in a very short amount of time. Did you do that VCA?\"<br><br>We had hours and hours. The rush looks bad. And with 12 players, a no lynch at some point might make sense, it would have been better than lynching a claimed town vig (who could prove himself at least of being a vig).<br><br>Dessew's 1214 \"I read IAI's case on RC as if RC's having claimed a BG and lynched a townie played a key role in it, which is just outright absurd. Unfortunately, I know little to nothing about wagon analysis, so I can't provide one.

I'd also like to add, that loosing a Vig instead of a BG is not such a tragedy (something similar arose durig the conversation), as Vigs are wild cards.\"<br><br>Agree that with Reinoe not surviving (a protective role other than RC's claim) and a dead town vig does make RC's claim more believable. You bringing that up is town points in your favor. Dessew, for vote count analysis, you need to see who voted the town and for what reasons. Think about how you play as scum, and say, how would I play? If you believe RC is a bodyguard, you must believe scum has a roleblocker. If I was scum then, why would I try to get RC lynched D1 when I could just have him roleblocked and call him a liar D2? Who started D2 with a vote on RC (sleepykrew)? This is what you need to think about/look at.<br><br>Pops 1216 \"I'm going to sheep Cyberbob a little bit here. I like his work.\"<br><br>Tell me what you like about his work? And with the whole RC might really be a bodyguard, it does make you look worse. Your the one that was ready to lynch him two days later if he was still alive.

I stand by my earlier explanation to you. In prior games, I've been called out for it by scum. You calling me out for it, if you really are a bodyguard, does make sense. Cyberbob took the bait tho. Guarantee he is scum. I'm not, sorry.<br><br>\"Another point, I find is conspicious that CD has been really lax about mentioning IAI at all, despite the fact that IAI had been attacking him throughout most of D1. That doesn't look like a town-town relationship to me, but, rather, either scum-scum or scum-town. Check out 906 where he tries to throw dirt on my BG claim. Him and Drew try and tag team me and get me lynched post-claim.\"<br><br>And where did my vote go when nobody jumped on you...back to Cooldog. What do you think about my question to Dessew: If you believe RC is a bodyguard, you must believe scum has a roleblocker. If I was scum then, why would I try to get RC lynched D1 when I could just have him roleblocked and call him a liar D2?<br><br>\"Also, I have no idea how a BG claim is \"easy\" for scum to fake? Maybe we could ask IAI how it's \"easy\" for me to fake my own death?\"<br><br>Well in all fairness, you haven't died yet. A mysterious \"roleblocker\" or saying I went for Player B instead of Player A are easy ways to fake the claim. But you notice I didn't come out and vote you D2. I'm starting to have doubts about my scum read on you, not going to lie.<br><br>\"IAI was coming after me for voting CD as opposed to Drew yesterday saying that I flipped my townread on CD. That was a misrepresentation as I explained in 1106. IAI wanted to know if I would vote CD specifically as a counterwagon to reinoe prior to reinoe's claim. Under those specific conditions, I did not want to vote CD. But after reinoe's claim and the (rightful) collapse of his wagon, CD was no longer a counterwagon to reinoe because reinoe wasn't a viable wagon any longer, do you follow me?\"<br><br>RC, you said CD was a town read and you would absolutely not vote him. Then 50 posts later, you voted him. Do you see my issue/concern with your stances and later votes? Scum make up reads, forget them, and vote other people later. I still find that pretty scummy, which is pulling me in the wrong direction of believing your bodyguard claim.<br><br>\"IAI contradicts himself in his own post, calling CD town and then asking players to vote for him in 1112.\"<br><br>I said I thought both wagons were town. CD had claimed vanilla townie, so my vote was in that direction over the unclaimed player. My preference was obviously you or Cyberbob, but neither of those wagons were taking off at the deadline.<br><br>\"IAI's contention that him not voting reinoe or Drew during D1 in post 1177 is hardly convincing at all. I elaborate as to why in 1191, but the short of it is that IAI is on record as saying he would vote Drew. It's nonsensical for him to turn right around and claim that him never voting Drew makes him town... he offered to do so!\"<br><br>Talk is cheap, I think I posted that on Page 2 of this thread. Yes I suspected Drew earlier in the day, but when push came to shove, I never moved my vote for him and pushed for Cooldog's lynch over him. If you think lynching a player like me D2 is the way to go, and leaving 5 players who were on both Reinoe's and Drew's wagon alive going into D3, have at it. I'll laugh at the townies responsible for my lynch postgame...<br><br>************<br><br>Sorry I have to run for a few days, hopefully I addressed everyone's questions/comments."}

I don't assume scum is on any big town-targetted wagon by default, and in reinoe's case in particular I don't think it's damning to have attacked reinoe.  Cooldog is among those posters whose line of thought seemed wrong, but internally consistent and understandable.  <br>Multiple actors seemed to shift focus to/from Drew, so that seems like an informative lynch.

He asked me whether or not I would vote CD as a counterwagon to reinoe before reinoe claimed. I flatly said that I would not do that and stand by that remark. <br><br>CD wasn't scummier than Drew necessarily, and neither was Drew scummier than CD. Again, SK, I told you that I was reluctant to continue pushing Drew due to the fact that I was worried that I was letting his attitude influence my read of him. Honestly, I thought that if I turned down the heat against Drew that I could move forward until tomorrow a reread Drew with a clean slate. <br><br>Now you can call me a liar about that or you can agree with me on that, but don't say that I \"dodged\" this question.

Contented, he walked through the park and gnawed away until he came across a small pond. The dog looked over into the pond and, to his amazement, another dog stared back at him. The other dog had a bone in his mouth that looked bigger than the one he had, so naturally he dropped his and went to grab the other dog's bone.

We started off with an even number of players, with a BG as the protective role and no Vig we couldn't reasonably change to odd numbers, there fore the presence of a Vig does make a BG claim more belivable. <span style=\"font-style: italic\">OTOH, IAI thinks that reinoe's death (who was a Neighbour and fakeclaimed a Tracker) does it, too.</span>"}

You said that he wouldn't try to get me lynched as scum, but I ask you why would he do it as town? IAI isn't dumb. He's also not the type to let pride get in his way, I think (see: his backing off from wanting to lynch me today). <br><br>singer, is something keeping you away from the IAI wagon? I mean, pops and IAI are cross-voting, so that's a wash. I think Bob and SK cancel each other out. I'm the most townie player in the game though, of course (I always say this kind of tongue-in-cheek, but it's half serious this game given my claim). farside is a big unknown. Remember that her and pops were best buddies during D1 when pops and her were working to undermine the reinoe wagon (this was a good thing), but then they worked together to undermine the CD wagon (this is an unknown, well, I mean I guess you know if it's good or not, lol). Granted, farside has not been friendly with pops this game as though he's a townread, but she suspects him all the while working with him to get an agenda done. I'm not necessarily saying they're both scum, but their motives are suspect. <br><br>Anyway, again, I'm not really unsatisfied with the way these wagons are competing against each other (I think that's very healthy and it lends itself to questioning players' motives tomorrow, especially the hammerer), but I think IAI is the clearly superior wagon. <br><br>Where's Goofy been? I'm concerned about him. He was so very townie looking yesterday, but he has been blah this whole day. In a way that makes me think he's still town (like me, he doesn't really care which wagon wins), but I could just be reading that into him."}

Also, the picking of Drew over Dog does make sense from his expressed reads on both, and he made the comment that he thought Dog was less likely to be scum, and voted someone both of you agree he had called scummy and did this in preference of voting a claimed PR though he was expressing his issue with the PR. It just doesn't sound either disassociated from his reads nor does it seem like some brilliantly needed scum distance - he basically voted someone he called scummy and pointed out that he found another player less scummy than them."}

This caught my eye immediately because it looked as though he was trying to breadcrumb being a protective role here. He mentions doctor out of nowhere, and the statement is awkward. All he needed to say was that you were his biggest townread. It would then be assumed that he would think you were worthy of a doc protection in his eyes. You may have missed it on the first go around, but I didn't because I knew I had a protective role already. It didn't make sense for someone to throw that out there to me. Another point, I find is conspicious that CD has been really lax about mentioning IAI at all, despite the fact that IAI had been attacking him throughout most of D1. That doesn't look like a town-town relationship to me, but, rather, either scum-scum or scum-town.  Check out <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6091486#p6091486\">906</a> where he tries to throw dirt on my BG claim. Him and Drew try and tag team me and get me lynched post-claim. Also, I have no idea how a BG claim is \"easy\" for scum to fake? Maybe we could ask IAI how it's \"easy\" for me to fake my own death? A doctor is an easy claim to fake, because the scum could always NK if they need to. Remember this is what IAI was angling to do before I called him out. I also want to point out, just so that I am on the record for this and you know this, I wanted IAI lynched yesterday (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6093040#p6093040\">957</a>), but I realized it would be foolish to try and pivot the wagon that late in the day. Three other quick points against IAI: <br><br>1) IAI was coming after me for voting CD as opposed to Drew yesterday saying that I flipped my townread on CD. That was a misrepresentation as I explained in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6095264#p6095264\">1106</a>. IAI wanted to know if I would vote CD specifically as a counterwagon to reinoe prior to reinoe's claim. Under those specific conditions, I did not want to vote CD. But after reinoe's claim and the (rightful) collapse of his wagon, CD was no longer a counterwagon to reinoe because reinoe wasn't a viable wagon any longer, do you follow me? <br>2) IAI contradicts himself in his own post, calling CD town and then asking players to vote for him in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6095360#p6095360\">1112</a>.<br>3) IAI's contention that him not voting reinoe or Drew during D1 in post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6103346#p6103346\">1177</a> is hardly convincing at all. I elaborate as to why in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6103398#p6103398\">1191</a>, but the short of it is that IAI is on record as saying he would vote Drew.

That's the criteria, okay? He qualified that statement and he's now omitting the qualifier to paint me in a certain light. In the universe where reinoe is my top scumread and hasn't claimed, I absolutely would never join IAI on a CD counter wagon.

She is being selective and narrow minded in her scope - also, not that when I first called her out on meta (something she admitted to not doing) her first reaction was a sudden lash out at me - when literally all I had done was ask if she'd done that research. Then she does the research and - shock of shocks - finds evidence to support her claim...until you actually start looking at the evidence and asking questions. Also, note her attitude towards IAI as compared to Pops and then compare the cases. Even Sleepy the tunnel king actually feels comfortable admitting that he scum reads both - as well he should since they've done the same stuff. But Farside acts surprised I even have that conclusion - while still sticking to her guns that it is Pops, not IAI, who looks scummy...for reasons...<br><br>That doesn't make you nervy about her?<br><br>It makes me nervy as hell - what have you figured out from trying to understand her?"}

Cyberbob basically stated hi thing, backed it up a bit, and then left in a huff the didn't feel obviously real and could have just been a fake way to avoid having to defend anything for days on end. He reacted to me saying 'I'm not sure' about his case by giving up on me? When his case is at L-1? To try to force through a deadline lynch? I didn't feel any buy-in there. Farside is focused, and is making cases, but the cases seem hollow considering the similarities between the two wagons and Farside not even discussing why one is good or bad besides making the meta claim about scumhunting, a claim she backed up awkwardly and with, in my opinion, a pretty clear showing of dishonesty in how the evidence was being presented that makes me question the motives all the more.<br><br>What are your thoughts?"}

Given that I have townreads on other players that voted Drew, the argument holds even less weight in my eyes. I don't think Drew was a bad lynch. At all. To say it was scum-driven is not accurate.

A simple glance at any of my town games would show I never do that for anyone I am town reading - and tend to be pretty aggressive in defense thereof. Note that I took pains to claim my town reads.

You're applying a black/white method to my scumhunting that I don't think holds water unless you think I'm very robotic in how I get my reads - and I don't think I should come across that way at all and am annoyed at needing to defend that I don't scumhunt via absolutes held in isolation from other info - I would tend to suggest that you look at any of my town games and see if I come off that sort of robotic to you.

It's kind of ironic, singer, that you're trying to draw this conclusion of a pops/SG partnership, when it seems to me that yourself and SK are the main two that are wanting to put the brakes on lynching him today. I don't speak for her, but I think SG is where I am in the sense that yesterday we made the wrong call, and today is the day to atone for that. I do not see a scenario in which both IAI and pops were town. The sides seemed too polarizing for that to be the case.<br><br>IAI's flip, farside's death, farside's flip, and pops' post today have told me all I need to hear.

This leaves four other possibilities: IAI, SK, Bob and SG.<br><br>Although it's possible, I don't think she tracked IAI. If she did, she was really making a gamble not to claim that she had role information that told her IAI did not go anywhere over night. Granted, IAI would likely not have made the kill were he scum, and farside's defense of IAI was strangely elevated over the course of the game, but if she believed she had a BG, she should've claimed that she had role information that told her IAI was likely innocent. I'd have protected her last night and she'd have gotten at least one more report. Then again, maybe I play more conservatively than she does. In any case, I don't think she went this direction, but it's certainly possible.<br><br>I contend she would not have investigated SK. Despite them butting heads a bit, I think farside maintained a pretty strong townread on him most of the game (see: <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6079047#p6079047\">697</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6109444#p6109444\">1249</a>).<br><br>Cyberbob is probably slightly more possible than SK, but she also maintained a townread on him despite butting heads with him as well (see: <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6079189#p6079189\">736</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6095116#p6095116\">1103</a>).<br><br>With SG, remember that she voted Konowa early on D1 in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6048355#p6048355\">63</a>. She didn't remove this until <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6066989#p6066989\">490</a>, but once she did, she almost immediately went back to Konowa (at this point Beck) in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6068055#p6068055\">505</a>. She still had Beck as her top scumread in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6069521#p6069521\">570</a> and she finally switched off for the last time in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6069772#p6069772\">581</a>. After this she mentions Beck a few times, but kind of in an inconclusive manner. It's hard to tell what she thinks of Beck in the second half of D1. The banter is neutral and she's clearly holding him at a distance. Her first mention of Beck on D2 is in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6103430#p6103430\">1198</a> when she is asking Beck for his opinion on me vs IAI. This seems to indicate to me that she is now leaning town on Beck, which is quite a departure from what she was doing on D1. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6107646#p6107646\">1236</a> is another example of farside acting kind of pally with Beck as they are both working together for a CD lynch. She later says that she sees Beck/pops as a scum pair, but the thing that sort of has me doubting an SG track though is SG's entry into the game. Once SG enters into the game, farside and SG seem to go at it. farside's now infamous <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6141017#p6141017\">1800</a> is all you need to see to know how she ultimately was feeling about this slot on D2 once SG stepped in. <br><br>Anyway, maybe this was all for naught, as I'm kind of just as lost as I was when I originally skimmed though. I think the four main possibilies are that she either tracked IAI, SK, Cyberbob or SG. All of these are reasonable, but they all also have things that suggest she didn't track that person. The likelihood of them is probably IAI &gt; SG &gt; Bob &gt; SK. Whomever she tracked, she got no result. Going forward, I'm going to assume I have an innocent track on all three of these players and take it into account tomorrow."}

There are many others.<br><br>With SG, I'm convinced we're kind of in the same boat in that both of us were really wrong about IAI and wanting to atone for that. I alluded to as much yesterday, but I've yet to see anything really convincing be brought against SG since she's replaced in. Additionally, and singer may not realize this, but pops was very much trying to push a Konowa wagon from the start of the game. I can refresh people's memories by giving links to posts <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6048703#p6048703\">69</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6050930#p6050930\">101</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6055255#p6055255\">196</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6086062#p6086062\">833</a>. He could be bussing, but pops doesn't really strike me as the type of player that's interesting in bussing given that SG and myself were the only two people he voted that haven't flipped town (and I know I'm town but he only voted me for, like, 20 posts anyway). If someone can prove me wrong with some meta, then I'd be willing to listen to it, but it doesn't really sit well with me. <br><br>Goofy, eh, although I think he's maybe slipped a touch from where I was with him earlier in this game, there's something so transparently townie about him. I know one or two of you picked on me earlier (I think it was Drew or IAI or both, come to think of it), but Goofy's posting style speaks to me. He's just... so sure of himself. He says what he feels like and comes across as fearless. I can give examples of this, but nearly every Goofy post is like this. He's succinct and always seems to post at the right times.<br><br>singer is the odd (wo)man out here.

CD had a weird relationship with a lot of people though (myself included). I remember farside arguing with me pretty hard about wanting to lynch CD. One final thing about CD that's especially damning for singer today? And the one thing you should seriously consider if you don't read another thing I have to right? CD was brought to L-1 in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6090902#p6090902\">886</a>, and guess who breaks the momentum for a CD wagon that he wasn't voting? pops in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6091151#p6091151\">893</a>. Once pops joined Drew in voting me, farside, IAI and Cyberbob followed in quick unison, effectively killing the CD wagon for the rest of the day. As far as I know, CD is the only living player that was brought to L-1 and had his wagon fall apart. And the person that orchestrated that was pops for the most part (farside had her hand in it, too, but she wouldn't have jumped if pops didn't do so first).<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: singersinger</span><br><br>I protected Goofy this go around as his vote on pops seemed the most genuine to me.

CD was not thought of as widely town for most of this game. Not by IAI, not by Drew, not by SK, not by farside. I went to bat for him for a time, but I have backed off from that position and have remained backed off from that position (and I caught a lot of flak for doing this!). Ironically, I think Cyberbob was one of the few players that genuinely did not want to lynch him and fought fiercely against that. I don't know where he stands now (although his vote certainly gives us a clue), but suffice it to say that CD didn't have too many fans, and I just haven't been turned around on this slot by singer's play. She's played adequate, but there's only so far her, \"I was right about pops; I must be town\" can get her in my mind. I've said this before to IAI, but that argument doesn't really hold much water for me given that I was wrong about pops and know I'm town. <br><br>---<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>SG 2028 wrote:</cite>Because my scum plan was to come in, defend my scumbuddy super hard on one day, and then immediately bus them the next day invalidating what I fought for all th eprevious day?</div></blockquote><br><br>This is WIFOMy, which I tend to be allergic to, but it's a fair point nonetheless.

To be fair, as I mentioned earlier in this post, I recall Cyberbob not wanting to lynch CD on D1 and being so-so on the prospect of lynching me. Unlike pops and farside, both of which went out of their way to deflate the CD wagon, Cyberbob never purported to want the CD wagon to succeed. Either of you can correct me if I am wrong about any of this. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>SG 2028 wrote:</cite>How do you explain Singer's move on Pops though?

That seems like a pretty focused town tunnel rather than a bus, no?</div></blockquote><br><br>Honestly, I didn't much care for singer's move to pops on D2. The main reason being her wishy-washiness as she came into the game. In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6119491#p6119491\">1372</a> she says she's going to vote IAI. In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6119927#p6119927\">1375</a>, she reaffirms that she's going to vote IAI and explains this to farside. After her and farside go at each other a bit (in fairness to singer, she claimed to have a farside townread early on), she recants in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6123306#p6123306\">1407</a>, essentially saying she \"mixed the names up\", and slowly starts to pivot toward pops. So, I mean, how do I explain it? I explain it by saying that she came into the game, stuck her finger in the air to see if she could get on the IAI wagon without too much resistance, caught some heavy resistance from farside and SK, and immediately moved to pops. I think she thought that if she didn't find a way to move to pops, farside and SK may have turned their attention toward her more heavily once again, and she thought the scumteam would be better served with her around rather than pops (especially if she got the credit for voting him). <br><br>I think farside was the one from the very start that tied you together with pops, and she did that from very, very early on in the game. She touched on it a handful of times. At some point singer took that ball and ran with it. I don't know if she brought anything new to the argument. It seems to me like the biggest argument in favor of you two being a scumteam is the IAI wagon, but, again, that doesn't really sell me in that I genuinely thought IAI was a better scum candidate than pops was. So, it's like, I can understand the viewpoint of another townie thinking that. I also appreciate that you came into the game and were willing to speak your mind in an unpopular way from the footing of a slot that wasn't very strong (I'd say the Konowa/Beck slot was about on par with the CD slot in terms of dislike, all things considered). singer didn't really do this, I don't think. Maybe she's more pensive personality-wise, but I don't think so. I think she was very, very careful in her entrance to this game and tried hard to \"fit in\" how she was supposed to as town. <br><br>---<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>singer 2029 wrote:</cite>Why go for a VT with a claimed BG out there...</div></blockquote><br><br>Are you saying this because no one else has said it for you yet?<br><br>I mean, I see the point, but on the other hand I don't see my role as much of a threat, especially in a room full of VTs (which I am assuming given the lack of any night actions and the deaths we've had already). Either the scum thinks I'll die from a block, or they still think they can say to the town \"why go for a VT with a claimed BG out there...\" and make it fly. <br><br>---<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Goofy 2032 wrote:</cite>Also RC, I didn't expect to wake up today, so good protect although it missed.</div></blockquote><br><br>I got your back, brah.

He isn't following up on my case (indeed, he is even kind of sighing theatrically and going 'aw geez, can't you just vote Singer and stop being silly?') and he didn't even do any scumhunting today, instead he waited for the first solid case presented (by a player he vaguely intimated he's still scumhunting) and then instant sheeped it and stopped discussing anything besides trying to shout you down and dismiss my position.<br><br>That is what you need to see, does it make sense now? Just ask yourself, what town would shut down communication like he has? Cyber is basically like 'full steam ahead, scum found, no other discussion or investigation needed'.<br><br>He isn't worried about tomorrow because he knows if he gets this lynch than tomorrow is probably meaningless. That's why he's doing what he's doing.<br>Basically at that point my only prayer is he at least shoots me for being right so I don't have to be endgamed in shame."}

I'm watching what everyone is saying. I'm watching where everyone is voting. At the moment, however, I am comfortable voting for you and, frankly, would like to see you lynched.

Yes, I was a little surprised that it took as long to lynch pops as it did. It shocked me that SG, Goofy and myself were the three players that were the most gung ho about it after how D2 went.

I don't think I am insulting your scum game here, I just think you took a calculated risk that was transparent (as you claim to be) in retrospect. Namely, that you wanted to feel out how the game would react if you were to try and sneak aboard the IAI wagon, immediately caught heat for that, and then jumped aboard with the pops trio (farside, Goofy and SK) as quick as you could. <br><br>---<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>SG 2053 wrote:</cite>the cases were identical.</div></blockquote><br><br>I don't understand what you mean by this.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>SG 2053 wrote:</cite>There was never a Cyberbob supported killed that I can find</div></blockquote><br><br>Again, I'm kind of confused as to what this means.

He'll probably dispute that, and I could go back and research this myself, but I won't defend Bob for him. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>SG 2053 wrote:</cite>I don't see the scum motivation there really.</div></blockquote><br><br>It's quite clear what the motivation is... IAI was town and pops was scum. singer came into this game and thought she could join the IAI wagon without getting herself into the spotlight for doing so. farside immediately started throwing accusations her way and she thought it wasn't worth the trouble to fight for an IAI lynch when she could get in good graces with her townread farside and get credit for bussing a lame goon. pops' self-vote yesterday was especially good evidence as to the fact that pops was onboard with using himself as bait for his scumbuddies to get credit off of. <br><br>---<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>singer 2058 wrote:</cite>These sequential sentences are very contradictory to me...<br><br>If the lynch isn't as obvious as yesterday, then why did you vote already (in within your first few posts)...</div></blockquote><br><br>I give credit where credit is due, and this is on point. Both of these points are solid.

I could care less about Bob's position on my protections and his willingness or lackthereof to analyze that. I do care about him contradicting himself over something that should be easy to explain (how much time he spent on the game) as well as his quick vote contradicting his assertion that yesterday was more obvious than today.<br><br>Further, this post is kind of crappy also in the sense that singer scumhunting is not a scumtell. I certainly am not suspicious of her asking questions of Bob. She's scummy for other reasons, but this is not one of them. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Cyberbob 2065 wrote:</cite>My reasons for now thinking you are scum are a) you had nothing of any use to say for some time after you replaced in, b) cooldog's wagon stalling at L-1 before dropping off (something which I have also commented on previously) and c) the fact that pops was the one that initiated the counterwagon on Drew. </div></blockquote><br><br>This is a much better post, however.

I appreciate that you're busy or (if you're town) you're trying to give the game thought, but you need to get to work. As SG basically says in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6206671#p6206671\">2184</a>, your content is junk. Even if I grant you that you're right and there's only one scum left, you shouldn't be playing that way. You should be assuming that there are two scum left and be pleasantly surprised if that turns out to be wrong. I mean, it should be an afterthought that you throw into a post as a ancillary thing, this should not be the entirety of your content for today. You're being too academic and not nearly  analytical enough. If I don't see a vote, a case, or some serious responses to the discussions had between every other living player over these past ~7 pages in your next post, I will probably vote you. I am dead serious. You are really pinging my scumdar hard with these posts. If you want me to be more specific, just look at <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6205153#p6205153\">2177</a>. This post is horrid. Let me count the ways...<br><br>1) The bitching at SG for \"not reading\" your posts is pointless. Is she scum for doing this? If no, then shrug it off and explain it to her again. If yes, then why don't you tell us this? This comment comes across as petty given the fact that SG has arguably spent more time getting fully vested in this game and trying to understand all the relationships as a replacement than any other living players. I'm not saying this to defend SG's honor or anything; I'm just upset that we're on page 88 and everyone has pretty much told you that we're waiting on you to give actual content and you're coming at us with this whiny, passive-aggressive \"SG read my posts before commenting please and thank you\". Maybe you didn't realize it, but it struck me as really stand-offish and elitist. It smacks of someone that is avoiding the real heart of the matter. <br>2) You're \"slightly leaning toward scum-Bob\". And why is this? Is this different from an opinion you had earlier today? Yesterday? The start of the game? Why or why not? Show your work. <br>3) \"but maybe...\" you undercut your \"slight\" scumread in the next few words. You already qualified your piss poor read by calling it slight (how you can have such minimal opinions of someone at this stage is beyond me, but leaving that aside...), but then you take it a step further and show more ineptitude by saying that you're not even sure if you actually have a slight scumread or not because it may be influenced by other people's cases. <br>4) You \"explicitly dislike\" some of the cases people have made against singer. This is news to me. Why is this the first time I am hearing of this? Why did you not say something when it happened? Are these players scum? <br><br>I could go on, but I think you get the point. You've been put on notice, brother, so make the next one count."}

I can't really defend what's chalked up to be 'not my fault' and then when only you and RC are the only firm town reads doing all of the grunt work, it doesn't really help. It's clear Goofy's been checked out for a while now, and Dessew only really came back in with opinions when he was pressured, though he comes in with a defense of me and voting Bob which is making me rethink my three-man scumteam theory. This game really sucks right now."}

It was originally posted by SK. The point is that if there were two three scum, the game could have ended jusr after two mislynches. It's quite straightforward.<br>2. It's a bit unorthodox. So the point is that I show that if there were three scum, the game wouldn't be balanced. I'll do this by comparing this game to a similar setup.<br>There are going to be a few assumptions you might disagree with, so let's clear them up beforehand.<br>a) All town PRs have been outed. It's actually kind of a crucial point, but since a killing and an informative role has already flipped, there's an unCC'd protective role, there's most likely a scum blocking role and btw, a miscellanious town role has flipped, too.<br>b) RC is town. I think he's been pretty townish and he's an unCC'd PR. But even if he was scum, it would just amplify my point. RC being town also means that there's a scum RB.<br>Okay, so we need a setup now. I won't link anything because I'm posting from my phone, but there's a thread called \"(Semi-) Open Design Challenge Finalists (Kids With Guns!)\" (please look at it, the OP is mith if it makes it easier for you to find it.) You can find several setups in the OP, the one created by Jackal is very similar to the one in this game. Jackal's setup (probably) went through a process (I don't know much about this whole challange stuff, tbh), so I take that it's balanced (and balance is objective &amp;c. all the stuff you hear.)<br>Then let's assume that we've got three scum after all. How does PF's game differ from Jackal's?<br>b) It's closed. Closedness buffs scum. For instance, in an open there would be no bright mind who wants to lynch an unCC'd BG.<br>b) There' some neighbour thing going on. Two town neighbours are obviously weak af, but you don't know my alignment, so let's consider a town-scum pairing, as well. Well, it's still not powerful, imo, there are some slip possibilities, of course, and if the scum dies earlier, the townie gets a bunch of towncred, but the advantages get overwhelmed by point c)<br>c) There's a Tracker instead of a Cop. Cops are one of the most powerful roles. Also, consider the usefulness of a Tracker with a Vig alive. Or a BG alive. It can receive false positives and false negatives. So adding point b and c together, town get nerfed to some extent.<br>d) One less player. It doesn't even need a comment.<br>So if there were three scum, you could get PF's game by taking Jackal's and making it more scum-sided to a considerable extent. That's no balance, therefore there must be a two-player scum team.<br><br>@singer: I meant that in that case for example if the roleblocker dies, scum loses the neighbour, too (as they are the same player.) And that situation might as well create a conftown, as well (see above.) In my experience scum PR are usuallyy spread out to avoid this kind of swing (for example when in one of my scumgames we had a GF, a RB and a Tracker, we were all given one role each, not like a GF-RB-Tracker and two MGs.) I think it's common practice, isn't it?"}

If the setup were Mafia Neighbour RB + MG (+ Town), the death of the RB of be much more detrimental to scum than that of the Goon (so it's swingy.) Scum wouldn't just lose half of itself (remember, the whole thing starts as \"if there are two scum\"), they also lose all their PRs and the flipping Neighbour might create a conftown player (and there's a BG, so the town-Neighbour's gonna stay for quite a time.) The swing can be reduced by distributing the roles more evenly (i.e.: Mafia RB + Mafia Neighbour.) NOTE: pops was a Goon. NOTE2: Drew was a Vig, so the setup's got just enough swing from town's side."}

I'm not even sure wether you're trying to make a point here and if you should be, what the point is supposed to be.<br>Okay, so again. There are several measures that can describe a game, one of them is swinginess. The more swing a game has, the more difficult it is to predict beforehand what's going to happen in the game. For instance, Vigs are a perfect example of roles amplifying swinginess. The game is going to be seriously affected by who gets the Vig role. Another example is making an overly powerful combined role while not giving anything anyone else. And before I forget to add, you generally want to reduce swing below a certain level.<br>Now, you believe that a Neighbour RB + MG scumteam is reasonable. It isn't, though, that's what singer and I had an exchange about not so long ago if you remember. It was on the previous page. Let us assume you're making sense, though.<br>Let's see what happens if the MG is lynched. Scum loses half of its team.<br>Let's see what happens if the Neighbour RB is lynched. Scum loses half of its team. Scum loses an extremely strong role. Scum loses a realtively weak role. If the other Neighbour is still alive, they get most likely conftown, who can be protected by the BG.<br>All this because it's Neighbour RB + MG instead of Neighbour + RB."}

My mood's been suprisingly good since the weekend. PoE is fair enough, I was hoping a 'real' case, though. Anyway, I suspect a two-player scumteam because of balance: 1.

There's a similar setup on this forum with three scum, except that it's open, town is more powerful and there's one more player (it's in that mith-project.) That tells me that three scum would be scumsided.<br>@RC: I think it's quite the contrary. If I thought there were two scum left, I'd just vote the bigger wagon out of singer and Bob. I mean you're town, Squirrel is also most likely town, and Goofy's posting doesn't seem to be beneficial from a scum point of view (stolen argument from CD.)

In the future when i make posting obligations I plan to make them go 3 days instead of 2 and there won't be a force replace rule after so many prods.  Technically Red should have been force replaced for a 3rd violation but as I myself should have been here on time on 2 occassions and since I didn't want late game replacing to effect a direct outcome i decided not to enforce the rule there.  Mod actions should not directly effect an outcome.  As town still had an opportunity to vote and lynch red I feel my decision was ok though I don't generally like all the blantant prod dodging.  So I think increasing things to 3 and removing the force replace rule would be good for my future games.  People will be replaced in future if they no post, no pickup prod, or ask to be replaced<br><br>Mafia and Town play was very good.  Town had a chance up until the last day.  I probably should have ended it at the time of the lynch given the mafia win condition but I didn't want to make the kill, I preferred mafia pick who gets it.  Desew can record the death anyway he pleases though since I should have ended it earlier.  Game ends as a mafia win town loss<br><br>Full role info incoming shortly"}

I reserve the right to edit these rules at any time should something truly unexpected occur.<br><br>01. All votes must be made bold or made using the vote tag. Unvoting is not required but I heavily prefer it. Any attempts at disguising your voting will be prohibited. If its treated as a vote and I think its a vote, its a a vote!<br><br>02. A majority of votes is required to lynch. If there is a lynch, no amount of bitching will prevent the lynch from happening. I am a moderator, not a charity. <br><br>03. When you live, live well. Live long. Prosper. When you're dead, shut up. Don't post in the games thread. Lie in a grave/furnace/corpse pile. Rot. <br><br>04. All days have a 14 day deadline. All nights have a 48 hour deadline. The thread will lock during night given the nature of the game<br><br>05. You can vote for no lynch to occur during the day. Simply post <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: No Lynch</span>. Should this vote reach a majority, it will happen. If no majority is reached during a day then there will be a no lynch when that day ends<br><br>06. Quoting or faking any PMs you receive from the mod will get you modkilled and blacklisted from any games I am running now or in the future. You may paraphrase anything in the PM. If you are worried you are quoting more so then paraphrasing you should probably PM me before I modkill you<br><br>07. Each player must post every 48 hours. If they do not, I will prod them. If they don't respond to the prod in Y days, then they will be replaced. If you have already received 2 prods and you go idle for 48 hours a 3rd time, I will force replace you. This rule will be temporarily ignored if you give V/la notice 2 days before going V/la. Anyone found to be faking V/la will be mod killed<br><br>08. Don't talk to each other outside of the game thread unless your role says you can. If you disobey this rule, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">you will be modkilled or force replaced pending the severity of your actions</span><br><br>09. No small or invisible text. Don\u2019t edit/delete previously submitted posts if you have the power to do so<br><br>10. This is a game. Have fun and respect the other players. Don't be a dick.<br><br>11. If it seems like it should be illegal, it probably is. Considering the fact rules sometimes can't cover everything. Please use your common sense. PM me if you think something you are about to do could break the rules or possibly ruin the game. <br><br>12. I am human. If I fuck up and make a mod error that personally looses you the game, then I will give you a technical auto win at the end of the game to make up for it <br><br>13. I respect anonymity on the internet and in mafia. If there is a scum group with a QT, I will <span class=\"noboldsig\">NOT</span> be posting a link to it at the end of the game. It is that scum teams decision as to whether or not a link to their QT will be posted at the end of the game<br><br>14. If I have to modkill a player, the following will occur. If that player was town, the day will immediately end as though they were the lynch. If that player was non-town the day will continue. Basically the worst case scenario will occur for their side. Please don't make me have to invoke this rule or any modkill related rules. I don't want to do it. I felt bad just writing this<br><br>15. The game will start with a Pregame phase. During this phase, any roles with the power to night talk may talk. Pregame will last 48 hours, you must PM a confirm to me saying you received and understand your role during Pregame, or i will look to replace you during day 1<br><br>16. If you have a night action and think you will be V/la during the night cycle, you can send the action to me in advance<br><br>17. If you have a night action and have already sent a target for your action, you can change you target before the night is over by sending me a message with the new choice<br><br>18. If you have a night action and forget to send me a choice, you get nothing.<br><br>19.

We thought you might be a PR, but I pointed out that you were of almost no threat by yourself, and it would require one of the louder town to agree with you for it to be any issue at all. That's one of a few reasons Sleepy died - he was at least shown to be able to lead compared to the other surviving town players. That then left town functionally leaderless except for a lurky RC and the kind of noisy Squirrel.

Maybe you should consider a bit of personal growth as well, speaking from experience it makes life a whole lot more enjoyable when people like being around you."}

How is BG easy to fake? Why were you scumreading, like, anyone (Bob, me &amp;c.) What did you get from your VCA and how? Many queations left unanswered.<br>Think of about rummy or 5-card poker. Both games have a primary goal you can realize in an unstant: lose your cards / get the strongest possible hand. But in order to get any good at them you must improve other cometences: paying attention to the others' cards / manipulating the opponents. Your reads were good this game, wether out of pure luck or natural talent, I don't really care.
