All <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=6470\" class=\"postlink\">site rules</a> apply.<br>2. Be nice. Mafia games can get heated but remember never to attack the person.<br>3. Play to your wincon.<br>4. Days are approximately 14 days long, nights are approximately 48 hours long. Extensions may be given the circumstances warrant it.<br>5. Failure to post at least once every 48 hours will result in a prod. If you do not pick up your prod in 24 hours, or if I have to prod you a third time, I will look for a replacement.<br>6. <span class=\"noboldsig\">Please</span> put votes in this format: <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Something_Smart</span>. Technically, bolded votes are allowed (<span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: Something_Smart</span>), but they are a lot harder to see. It's easier for you and easier for me. In case you don't know, you can vote with:<br><dl class=\"codebox\"><dt>Code: <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"selectCode(this); return false;\">Select all</a></dt><dd><code>[vote]Something_Smart[/vote]</code></dd></dl><br>and unvote with<br><dl class=\"codebox\"><dt>Code: <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"selectCode(this); return false;\">Select all</a></dt><dd><code>[unvote][/unvote]</code></dd></dl><br>Unvotes are not necessary to change your vote.<br>7. If more than half the players are voting for a player, then that player is lynched and removed from the game, and the day will end. If the deadline is reached before a lynch occurs, the day will end without a lynch.<br>8. If you have a question for me, put it in bold and say <span class=\"noboldsig\">@Mod</span> or <span class=\"noboldsig\">@Something_Smart</span>. If it's not something you want made public, feel free to shoot me a PM.<br>9. <span style=\"color: #FFBF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">This lovely shade of yellow (#FFBF00) is the mod color.</span></span></span> Do not use it. Do not impersonate me.<br>10. Do not discuss this game in any other thread except in PTs created specifically for this game. Do not discuss any other ongoing game in this thread.<br>11. Do not quote any out-of-thread communications with me or with any other player.<br>12. The day after you are lynched or nightkilled, you may make one \"bah!\" post with no game-related information in it.<br>13. Do not pretend to break any of these rules. Pretending to break a rule is punishable just as harshly as actually breaking it.<br>14. My word is law. Just because it is not stated here does not mean that it is acceptable. I am generally a nice person and will give you a warning if you do something I don't approve of, but it's always better to ask than risk the consequences (see rule 8).<br>15. This game is <span style=\"color: #FF0000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">3 mafia-aligned players</span></span> versus <span style=\"color: #00FF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">10 town-aligned players</span></span>.<br>16. This game follows the <a href=\"http://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Normal_Game\" class=\"postlink\">Normal Guidelines</a>. At least one player has the following role PM:<br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Welcome, XXXX, to Mini 1786: Inspirational Mafia!<br><br>You are a <span style=\"color: #00FF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Vanilla Townie.</span></span><br>You have no special abilities.

You just fell for one of my favorite trap scum tells. It's called the \"deliberately weak argument.\" How it works is you make an argument and then somewhere in there you throw in a point that is deliberately bad. Easy to refute. It's a motivation tell to determine if someone is arguing in good faith or not. See, town players tend to address the argument in its entirety, because they want to evaluate the argument and they are interested in determining the alignment of the person making it. Scum, however, don't care about that. They are just arguing to score points. They go directly for the deliberately weak argument and attack it, and avoid the rest of the argument entirely.<br><br>You want to know which pattern describes what you just did?<br><br>I'll give you a hint. It starts with Sc. And ends with Umfucker.<br><br>Playtime is over. <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">confirm vote: katsuki</span>"}

Shotty is right that <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7844235#p7844235\">116</a> is entirely ad hom, especially given that even if Katsuki is town, Shotty could be scum, and even if they're both town it's hardly VI play to suspect someone that at least three other townies are suspicious of.<br><br>Shea's play looks very straightforwardly town to me so far (especially if Katsuki is in fact scum). I am also skeptical  of Katsuki's strong early townread on UT; the only thing in his ISO that I can possibly see that could lead to that was the persistence in asking why MoI was scum, but that does not seem worthy of a townread as strong as that stated in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7844161#p7844161\">112</a>. <br><br>I <span style=\"font-style: italic\">would</span> appreciate if no hammer happens until the one player who has yet to give a stance (Snarky) can comment on the wagon before we see a flip. But not enough to unvote. The one thing that kind of gives me pause is that 3/4 of the players other than Katsuki (everyone but creature, kmd, snarky) have expressed strong suspicions, which would make the odds of someone early powerbussing pretty high. But that's not too surprising with this playerlist, especially given that I can see either kmd or snarky as scum (I think creature is town).</div></blockquote><br><br>You've played with me before enough to know I can read some players from a couple of posts.

Why did you feel the need to be intentionally obtuse about the whole thing if you're voting me for that simple reason? I was not attacking the new player, merely trying to gather some info on how they think while it was still early in the game. <br><br>That would also partially explain you're utterly ludicrous attack on me, but it does not change the fact that you intentionally took everything in your grasp to twist in as scummy a way as you could, misrepresenting the majority, if not all the things I've said thus far.</div></blockquote><br><br>I'm voting you for (now) 5 reasons.<br><br>1) I felt that your question to kage was setting up an attack on a newer player. I really didn't like the line of questioning on that slot in particular which is why I then attacked you for asking it. Your response to me didn't help, as you refused to answer my question and attacked me for \"answering your question for him\" which I didn't do. I never answered your question. I attacked you for asking it.<br><br>2) I feel like your tone with regards to yourself is wildly different from how you are interacting with other players. You want other people to be accountable for the things they do in thread, which is great, but you don't seem to want to hold yourself to the same standard. You continued to joke vote MoI while attacking other players for not being serious enough. You joke fake claimed. Basically it looked like you were trying to attack players for serious things while, when people called your behavior into question for similar reasons you basically were like \"oh come on its still RVS\"<br><br>3) One of the main things I look for in scum reading is what are the motivations of players when they're arguing with you. I wrote a whole long treatise about this in mafia discussion a long time ago. I think there is a fundamental difference in the way that town players and scum players argue. Town players tend to grant the possibility that the person they are arguing with is town, while scum players do not. This leads to different kinds of arguments. A town argument typically involves things like addressing all (or at least most) of the points, conceding arguments that they agree with, looking for other things about the player which are relevant. That is because town are interested in alignment. Scum are not, when they argue it typically looks like someone trying to score points in a debate. They attack weak arguments. They don't give credence to good points. They just simply point and try to make the other person look like an idiot because that makes them look like the \"winner\" of the argument. I feel like your arguing style much more closely aligns with this second pattern in the game then it does the first.<br><br>4) More to the point, you fell for a motivation tell that I deliberately threw out there to see who would attack it. You argued not in order to discern my alignment, but rather you attempted to discredit me by going for the low hanging fruit of the deliberately weak argument.<br><br>5) Your refusal to seriously claim is deliberately anti town because you're upset. Town refusing to claim (and fake claiming) when they're at l-1 hurts town in general. If you are town, I suggest you cut it out immediately. More importantly, I've seen town use this tactic far less than scum, in the hopes that the refusal to claim will diffuse the bandwagon.<br><br><br>Hope that helps!"}

You basically unvoted for no reason, and when people do that it makes me try to figure out what the reason is. It's not because you think he's likely to get quick lynched out of nowhere. It might be because you don't think the wagon is good, which is clearly also not true, at least from your previous statements. Your unvote then only makes sense to me in the context of hoping that the wagon will sort of diffuse or hoping to be able to get a counter wagon quietly going. Those two options seem way more likely than anything else to me. There simply is no other reason to unvote. Your vague assertion that SS is scummy also adds onto this suspicion, especially given the fact that SS has made exactly 2 of them today, and neither of them have content in them that you could possibly find scummy. So, it looks like you're setting up to give yourself outs to start or join onto a counter wagon on a lurker.<br><br>I also think you've taken every opportunity to defend me today, which is not something that town typically does.

Given the lack of motivation and the fact that you specifically couched your post in the language of \"Agreeing with shea/joining shea\" even though your unvote was not remote similar to my unvote in either motivation or function, makes me think that you're buddying to me."}

I can definitely see a perspective arguing that my unvote was scummy. The reason that I hadn't unvoted earlier was because I was hoping to get a claim from Katsuki, who has now made it clear that that isn't happening. Given that, the vote doesn't really serve any purpose that outweighs the possibility of someone hammering before remaining people give opinions on the wagon (which is even still a big possibility at L-2 given that both shotty and kage have more or less said that they're going to hammer). Especially seeing as this wagon is something that I'd typically expect to be very divisive, but isn't, which makes pre-flip opinions on it from every player valuable.<br><div align=\"center\"><hr style=\"height:14px; width:100%\"></div><br>P-edit @Shea: I figured you might say I was buddying you.

I tend to find townreads more easily than scumreads. Giving reasoning for townreads early is often a matter of whether or not I feel like elaborating on them.

I feel very similar about it as I do about shotty. Its a post with a lot of content but when you dig deep down into it it doesn't look like very much scumhunting to me. Just a bunch of questions that are only tangientally related to the game.<br>implosion: Already well-documented. I'll feel a lot better about Implosion if Kats flips town.<br>UT: Reasons that I don't want to mention yet.<br>Lowell: His posts read really off to me. I'll have to reread some old games.

If Kats flips town that means that I'll be able to cross off some people from my scum list, most notably implosion, but also a couple of the people who jumped onto the wagon without much justification, as well as Kage, because I don't think hammering in the manner in which they did makes much sense from a scum perspective?<br><br>5) On the subject of Kage, I think I would be more comfortable if they replaced out. This is because part of me is focusing on the mental disabilities they mentioned earlier, and I'm hesitant to attack a lot of what they're doing/read it in the way that I typically would because I have those thoughts in the back of my mind. If Kage is scum who hammered his scum buddy there, I would be forced to conclude that they are using claims of mental illness to gain an advantage in the game. I really really really hope this isn't true. As someone who has suffered from mental health issues myself, it would make me blindingly angry. :/ I feel bad saying this but its a relevant part of my post day thought process.<br><br>PEDIT Addressed to shotty in particular. When I have the power to make sure we don't lynch by unvoting, how is it \"claiming more power than [1] have\" to say that I will unvote in order to stop a quick hammer? In fact, if I had stayed unvoted he wouldn't have been hammered.

You just fell for one of my favorite trap scum tells. It's called the \"deliberately weak argument.\" How it works is you make an argument and then somewhere in there you throw in a point that is deliberately bad. Easy to refute. It's a motivation tell to determine if someone is arguing in good faith or not. See, town players tend to address the argument in its entirety, because they want to evaluate the argument and they are interested in determining the alignment of the person making it. Scum, however, don't care about that. They are just arguing to score points. They go directly for the deliberately weak argument and attack it, and avoid the rest of the argument entirely.<br><br>You want to know which pattern describes what you just did?<br><br>I'll give you a hint.

You just fell for one of my favorite trap scum tells. It's called the \"deliberately weak argument.\" How it works is you make an argument and then somewhere in there you throw in a point that is deliberately bad. Easy to refute. It's a motivation tell to determine if someone is arguing in good faith or not. See, town players tend to address the argument in its entirety, because they want to evaluate the argument and they are interested in determining the alignment of the person making it. Scum, however, don't care about that. They are just arguing to score points. They go directly for the deliberately weak argument and attack it, and avoid the rest of the argument entirely.<br><br>You want to know which pattern describes what you just did?<br><br>I'll give you a hint.

I see your <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7850023#p7850023\">204</a> but it hardly stems from a standpoint of \u201cScum Implosion with Scum Kats\u201d only to my eye.  That may have been your intention but that\u2019s my take-away.   In fact I think Scum-Implosion buddying you is more likely to unvote Town Kats than Scum Kats.  Scum Implosion doesn\u2019t benefit from the accusations of trying to fizzle the wagon (which you yourself made) on a partner. <br><br>I\u2019m curious if we do indeed see buddying meta from Implosion.<br><br>Fair enough on the Untrod thing but your lack of explanation on what appears to be a meta-tell makes it hard to take the statement seriously."}

Now, I'm sure this is all outdated. We'll see though.<br><br>So I saw spoilers when I was trying to find where I was and stuff and I know Kat got lynched. For what it's worth, I have no problem with the questions toward kage. The only thing that stands out as possibly scummy is \"you know I'm going to claim power role\" because it's phrased in a way that emphasizes the claim rather than the role itself. It looks like an attempt to stop the wagon, not an honest \"hey guys I'm useful\". I have slight  doubts about that though because it immediately followed \"I'm not claiming because the wagon is shit\" but that kind of feels softclaimy too. I dunno, I guess it doesn't matter at this point, but hopefully Kat is scum.

In this game, it was the \"make it clear my votes are serious but don't explain so we can see who asks\" and only Creature did. Unfortunately, that was followed by a 40 hour work week crammed into 3 days immediately followed by a lynch and now I'm rushing my catch up. Anyone who has played with me knows I'm pretty active typically and that's true regardless of alignment.<br><br>I've read up to the hammer and mostly just want to make sure I beat the Mod to the submit button so I'll post this as is for now and if I have anything to say to twilight stuff, that will follow shortly. I'm also around today, so if anyone wants to ask me stuff there's that."}

I said why I don't like your posts. I led and started this wagon. In what way is that unaccountable? Do you not try to look at the players who are voting with you to discern their alignment?

Thats bizarre.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Third vote on wagon you guys don't even need to read further, Shea is obvscum.<br><br>#Jeeptell</div></blockquote><br><br>Congrats. You just fell for one of my favorite trap scum tells. It's called the \"deliberately weak argument.\" How it works is you make an argument and then somewhere in there you throw in a point that is deliberately bad. Easy to refute. It's a motivation tell to determine if someone is arguing in good faith or not. See, town players tend to address the argument in its entirety, because they want to evaluate the argument and they are interested in determining the alignment of the person making it. Scum, however, don't care about that. They are just arguing to score points. They go directly for the deliberately weak argument and attack it, and avoid the rest of the argument entirely.<br><br>You want to know which pattern describes what you just did?<br><br>I'll give you a hint. It starts with Sc.

I can definitely see a perspective arguing that my unvote was scummy. The reason that I hadn't unvoted earlier was because I was hoping to get a claim from Katsuki, who has now made it clear that that isn't happening. Given that, the vote doesn't really serve any purpose that outweighs the possibility of someone hammering before remaining people give opinions on the wagon (which is even still a big possibility at L-2 given that both shotty and kage have more or less said that they're going to hammer). Especially seeing as this wagon is something that I'd typically expect to be very divisive, but isn't, which makes pre-flip opinions on it from every player valuable.</div></blockquote><br>So the only reason you were voting Katsuki was to get his claim?

It seemed likely he would claim a PR. And I don't think it's particularly bad to back off of scum after forcing them to claim PR d1 since it means you'll be getting additional evidence that they're scum each night that they don't die."}

For what it's worth, I have no problem with the questions toward kage. The only thing that stands out as possibly scummy is \"you know I'm going to claim power role\" because it's phrased in a way that emphasizes the claim rather than the role itself. It looks like an attempt to stop the wagon, not an honest \"hey guys I'm useful\". I have slight  doubts about that though because it immediately followed \"I'm not claiming because the wagon is shit\" but that kind of feels softclaimy too. I dunno, I guess it doesn't matter at this point, but hopefully Kat is scum.

The point that a fair bit of my justification was because of anti-townness is fair. Frankly the possibility of Katsuki being town who was refusing to play pretty much objectively in a way in the town's interest was also pushing me somewhat to vote him. That kind of thing really annoys me. <br><br>I don't like shotty's push on BBT for a different reason from him actually. Shotty is correct (you can scumhunt in posts where you don't state reads); however his posts in the discussion have an air of caught-for-the-wrong-reasons. BBT defending himself argumentatively is also a really bad reason to scumread him; plenty of players will counter any argument made that they disagree with. It feels kind of like shotty thinks bbt is going to be an easy vote to justify (or an easy place to apply pressure) because his catchup is awkward given the not knowing who died.<br><br>Regardless from that:<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Unvote</span><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Snarky</span><br><br>My vote is probably going to remain parked here until he gives any semblance of actual content (i.e. a justification for anything he's ever said). <br><br>I also don't really feel like Lowell is particularly scummy anymore.

As I'm reading up, I also like BBT's pointing out that you poked at him for something pretty null. About that last one by the way, you keep saying you asked it to scumhunt. Can you be more specific? Like what were you expecting as an answer that might tell you anything about his alignment. <br><br>BBT, Creature is a meta read. He prefers town and his scum entrances lack confidence.

This latest attack on him forgetting the NK is BS too.<br><br>Shea wanted reasons for the rest of my reads too, so here:<br>-Kage's posts were ridiculously genuine, especially when he'd do townish things and go \"don't town read me for it\".

I think it shows genuine frustration at an unnecessarily exposed power role.<br>-Lowell. He feels...I dunno. Invested. He's typically pretty low content and his posts here feel more like he wants town to do well. I feel like he believes what he's saying and that his reads are good.<br>-Magna, while I didn't like his Kat vote and his Day 1 was more underwhelming than I'd expected, I'm starting to understand what he's doing.<br>-UT. I just can't come up with anything which is why he's null. But I have more town reads than I should so I may look into him more soon. Time permitting of course.<br>-Implosion. I need to figure out if it's a bias or if there's a reason for it, but I don't find myself agreeing with him and his posts don't feel genuine. There was one thing I remember liking, but if I remember right it relied on Kat being scum.<br>-BBT, it was his Kat vote I didn't like. His catch up feels good, but BBT is hard for me to read because he's good scum so I have a hard time revising a scum read because of a good catchup."}

Because there is no way to actually get a read from a vote that is independent of alignment IMO.[/quote]<br>Disagree. You can read player x as townish for their vote on player y in a vacuum regardless of player y's alignment. In fact the only way it even makes sense in such a case that player x's alignment is predicated on player y's alignment is because of conditional probabilities. Apart from that, if player x is town, then player x is going to make the same arguments towards player y whether player y is <span style=\"font-style: italic\">actually</span> town or <span style=\"font-style: italic\">actually</span> scum; it's just a matter of what player x is perceiving player y to be. Therefore we have to read the vote in a vacuum to some degree. But overall this is a somewhat moot point because like some of the other arguments I've made it doesn't matter if you don't think you can get a read from a vote that is independent of alignment because other players (i.e. Creature) may believe that they can. My Creature townread was deteriorating as he didn't seem to be providing any reasoning apart from the (IMO) very poor post directed towards me but I suspect the townslip in 464 was not faked so he's back to town for a different reason now.<br><br>Shotty attacking Creature feels bad for a similar reason to shotty attacking bbt. I really cannot see \"Creature didn't see who died -&gt; he must either be conspiring with bbt or trying to fake it himself separately\" being a likely thought process from town. There's no way (or at least it seems extremely unlikely) that two scum would conspire together to both townslip. I just don't see that being a likely thing that scum would decide to do in a game like this where I think there is probably the impression that most of the player list is going to be highly skeptical of townslips and the like (although I am less skeptical than most people). In particular the incredulity that Shotty displays in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7869559#p7869559\">470</a> feels really disingenuous; \"scum don't care\" is not true, scum just already know who died. Implying that he's scum because he \"didn't care\" about who died at night feels like it's just logically inaccurate."}

I don't generally have any problems with magna's posting (there are some things that I disagree with but those are just disagreements) but I still am not really able to get a good read on him. Snarky has yet to do anything (although again I'm willing to buy what kmd mentioned as a very weak towntell). <br><br>I think UT is another good candidate for scum. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7850603#p7850603\">232</a> feels like a bit shady of an analysis. Maybe like he felt like he wanted to say another thing about another player but didn't have anything particularly useful reads-wise to say. It's also possible (a stretch maybe though) that he's scum, listed four town in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7850602#p7850602\">231</a> (shea, lowell, me, magna) and then went \"hrm i should mention a scumbuddy too\" and mentioned shotty in 232. Definitely a stretch but it's quite possible. I'm still sort of trying to figure out what I think of the rest of his posting."}

You've done this at least twice now and Lowell has done it at least once as well. This is deeply flawed because you're projecting your particular version of how town plays on to me.

Two (although I can't quite tell if you're doing this based on your wording), even if your vision of \"consistent with town play\" were in some sense objectively right you'd be implying that town will always play according to that objective standard (which I think a very brief review of yesterday will prove wrong). <br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>And his reads-list doesn\u2019t really sort of align in my mind \u2013 I\u2019m lumped into the group of \u2018maybe scum\u2019 (Untrod who he addresses directly) even though clearly implosion states he has no read on me aka I should be Null.

Yet you\u2019ve never even looked to re-assess your read on the slot given Creature never followed through on the post which I found suspect.  I just don\u2019t see a development of a read on the slot that feels at all natural.  He just sits in your second tier of Town reads.<br><br>The BBT reads feels like pure appeasement.

Your entrance looked like buddying the newb. Your interactions with Shea were kind of ugly. Your actions around the Kat lynch were off. The way you expressed the lurkerscum read on Snark doesn't feel natural. I get a defensive vibe from your posts. The fact that I vote you and you say \"but I'm scumhunting\" is weird. As I'm reading up, I also like BBT's pointing out that you poked at him for something pretty null. About that last one by the way, you keep saying you asked it to scumhunt. Can you be more specific? Like what were you expecting as an answer that might tell you anything about his alignment. <br><br>BBT, Creature is a meta read. He prefers town and his scum entrances lack confidence. Here, he feels confident even as he's being put down. And the motivation in his posts, even if weak, feels town. This latest attack on him forgetting the NK is BS too.<br><br>Shea wanted reasons for the rest of my reads too, so here:<br>-Kage's posts were ridiculously genuine, especially when he'd do townish things and go \"don't town read me for it\". The claim only strengthens that read.<br>-Shea, cleared by Kage<br>-Snark, this one is subtle. Very subtle. Look at post 309. I'm legit townreading a dude for using a smilie. The facepalm. I think it shows genuine frustration at an unnecessarily exposed power role.<br>-Lowell. He feels...I dunno. Invested. He's typically pretty low content and his posts here feel more like he wants town to do well. I feel like he believes what he's saying and that his reads are good.<br>-Magna, while I didn't like his Kat vote and his Day 1 was more underwhelming than I'd expected, I'm starting to understand what he's doing.<br>-UT. I just can't come up with anything which is why he's null. But I have more town reads than I should so I may look into him more soon. Time permitting of course.<br>-Implosion. I need to figure out if it's a bias or if there's a reason for it, but I don't find myself agreeing with him and his posts don't feel genuine. There was one thing I remember liking, but if I remember right it relied on Kat being scum.<br>-BBT, it was his Kat vote I didn't like. His catch up feels good, but BBT is hard for me to read because he's good scum so I have a hard time revising a scum read because of a good catchup.</div></blockquote><br><br>^Town Post^"}

However, confirmed town jumped off. Drmy switched to BBT alone. And UT stayed. So it's not like anything huge came from it. The day became Implosion vs Creature and no one on the Lowell wagon did anything to change it to that, so *shrug*. Maybe you can argue that because Implosion flipped town, it makes Creature more likely scum, but that feels like a stretch just based on these two votes. I remember him getting more though so maybe that will have some merit before I'm done here.<br><br>Creature (4)- Lowell, MagnaofIllusion, drmyshottyizsik, <span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: green\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Thestatusquo</span></span></span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: green\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">implosion</span></span></span> (2)- SnarkySnowman, BlueBloodedToffee<br>SnarkySnowman (2)- <span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: green\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">implosion</span></span></span>, Untrod Tripod<br>drmyshottyizsik (1)- Kmd4390<br><br>So. Three scenarios:<br>Scenario 1 - Creature is town. In this case, scum don't have any reason to worry unless Snark is scum. Let's do Snark town first. Scum are probably spread out among the three wagons. So one of Lowell/Magna/drmy, BBT, and UT. I'm not really finding this scenario likely.<br>Scenario 2 - Same as the first, but with Snark as scum. In this one, UT is probably town and Snark's buddies are on the Creature wagon (Lowell, Magna, Drmy). Because Drmy was on the earlier Lowell wagon, either he was bussing or Magna is scum. In this scenario, scum is likely to shift to the Implosion mislynch later.<br>Scenario 3 - Creature is scum. Watch for scum to jump all over the Implosion wagon in this case. UT and Snark look bad in this scenario for the simple fact of being off the Creature wagon. (Sorry, I know confirmation bias is showing on BBT but he belongs in this group too technically.<br><br><span style=\"color: green\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">implosion</span></span></span> (5)- SnarkySnowman, BlueBloodedToffee, Kmd4390, MagnaofIllusion,Creature\u00a0(L-1)<br>Creature (3)- Lowell, drmyshottyizsik, <span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: green\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Thestatusquo</span></span></span><br>SnarkySnowman (2)-<span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: green\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"> implosion</span></span></span>, Untrod Tripod<br><br>Ok let's make sense of what happened here. I joined the Implosion wagon and was immediately joined by Magna (who was voting Creature) and Creature (who voted out of self preservation regardless of his own alignment). So, again, Creature's flip is critical to a legitimate analysis, but let's try the scenario game again:<br>Scenario 1 - Creature is town. Magna is likely scum who jumped ship. Snark was likely scum already on the wagon and Lowell or drmy stayed put on Creature.<br>Scenario 2 - Creature is scum. Snark still looks bad tbh. And someone is bussing somewhere. Creature town looks more likely I think.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: green\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">implosion</span></span></span> (6)- SnarkySnowman, Kmd4390, Creature, Aristophanes, Untrod Tripod, drmyshottyizsik\u00a0(LYNCH)<br>Creature (3)- Lowell, <span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: green\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Thestatusquo, I Am Innocent</span></span></span><br>drmyshottyizsik (1)- <span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: green\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">implosion</span></span></span><br><br>And we end up here. Either Magna and Lowell are BOTH scum who managed to stay off the wagon or this lynch is absolutely loaded with scum. It could be as simple as 2-3 of Snark/UT/drmy with 0-1 of Lowell/Magna or I could be wrong about Creature which explains scum's interest in the Implosion lynch (Creature/Snark/drmy?). I do remember UT hanging on to his Snark vote and only voting implosion to avoid no lynch and unlike drmy, he feels consistent in saying that. So Snark and drmy look like scum if Creature is town and one of Lowell/Magna would be a partner.<br><br>Conclusion<br>So basically here's what has changed in my reads:<br>Lowell: I wasn't entirely sure where to put him before, but I'm confident he's town now.<br>UT: Same as Lowell, but not quite as strong.<br><br>Magna: I see a lot of scenarios where he is scum. I was shelving him for reasons I don't feel like getting into, but I remember his Kat vote being pretty bad and he seemed to not really care who we lynched between Creature and Implosion. I can see Magna as scum, but not with Creature. Also, I know it's lame but considering his reputation, the old \"why is he alive on Day 3\" is ringing in the back of my mind.<br>Snark: Again, he has a lot of scenarios where he fits as scum. I could see myself PoEing him as scum at the very least.<br><br>Creature: I'm not one for info lynches, but I see a lot depends on his flip just based on his Day 2 wagon. I mean other people's flips help sort him too so I'm not going to advocate lynching him just to get his flip. As for what has changed in my read on him though, I'm open to the idea that he was scum. I started to see it a little on Day 2, but there are definitely scenarios where he fits now. If he is town though, we've been pretty awful so far.<br><br>What hasn't changed in my reads:<br><strike>BBT</strike> Aris - He's town. The replace out. He just is.<br>Shea - Kage confirmed him as town<br>Drmy - Maybe I'm tunneling, but it's hard to see him being town."}

I don\u2019t like his clearing of BBT\u2019s slot that he never followed up on.  But he was on Shotty a good portion of the days.

However, confirmed town jumped off. Drmy switched to BBT alone. And UT stayed. So it's not like anything huge came from it. The day became Implosion vs Creature and no one on the Lowell wagon did anything to change it to that, so *shrug*. Maybe you can argue that because Implosion flipped town, it makes Creature more likely scum, but that feels like a stretch just based on these two votes. I remember him getting more though so maybe that will have some merit before I'm done here.<br><br>Creature (4)- Lowell, MagnaofIllusion, drmyshottyizsik, <span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: green\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Thestatusquo</span></span></span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: green\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">implosion</span></span></span> (2)- SnarkySnowman, BlueBloodedToffee<br>SnarkySnowman (2)- <span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: green\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">implosion</span></span></span>, Untrod Tripod<br>drmyshottyizsik (1)- Kmd4390<br><br>So. Three scenarios:<br>Scenario 1 - Creature is town. In this case, scum don't have any reason to worry unless Snark is scum. Let's do Snark town first. Scum are probably spread out among the three wagons. So one of Lowell/Magna/drmy, BBT, and UT. I'm not really finding this scenario likely.<br>Scenario 2 - Same as the first, but with Snark as scum. In this one, UT is probably town and Snark's buddies are on the Creature wagon (Lowell, Magna, Drmy). Because Drmy was on the earlier Lowell wagon, either he was bussing or Magna is scum. In this scenario, scum is likely to shift to the Implosion mislynch later.<br>Scenario 3 - Creature is scum. Watch for scum to jump all over the Implosion wagon in this case. UT and Snark look bad in this scenario for the simple fact of being off the Creature wagon. (Sorry, I know confirmation bias is showing on BBT but he belongs in this group too technically.<br><br><span style=\"color: green\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">implosion</span></span></span> (5)- SnarkySnowman, BlueBloodedToffee, Kmd4390, MagnaofIllusion,Creature\u00a0(L-1)<br>Creature (3)- Lowell, drmyshottyizsik, <span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: green\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Thestatusquo</span></span></span><br>SnarkySnowman (2)-<span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: green\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"> implosion</span></span></span>, Untrod Tripod<br><br>Ok let's make sense of what happened here. I joined the Implosion wagon and was immediately joined by Magna (who was voting Creature) and Creature (who voted out of self preservation regardless of his own alignment). So, again, Creature's flip is critical to a legitimate analysis, but let's try the scenario game again:<br>Scenario 1 - Creature is town. Magna is likely scum who jumped ship. Snark was likely scum already on the wagon and Lowell or drmy stayed put on Creature.<br>Scenario 2 - Creature is scum. Snark still looks bad tbh. And someone is bussing somewhere. Creature town looks more likely I think.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: green\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">implosion</span></span></span> (6)- SnarkySnowman, Kmd4390, Creature, Aristophanes, Untrod Tripod, drmyshottyizsik\u00a0(LYNCH)<br>Creature (3)- Lowell, <span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: green\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Thestatusquo, I Am Innocent</span></span></span><br>drmyshottyizsik (1)- <span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: green\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">implosion</span></span></span><br><br>And we end up here. Either Magna and Lowell are BOTH scum who managed to stay off the wagon or this lynch is absolutely loaded with scum. It could be as simple as 2-3 of Snark/UT/drmy with 0-1 of Lowell/Magna or I could be wrong about Creature which explains scum's interest in the Implosion lynch (Creature/Snark/drmy?). I do remember UT hanging on to his Snark vote and only voting implosion to avoid no lynch and unlike drmy, he feels consistent in saying that. So Snark and drmy look like scum if Creature is town and one of Lowell/Magna would be a partner.<br><br>Conclusion<br>So basically here's what has changed in my reads:<br>Lowell: I wasn't entirely sure where to put him before, but I'm confident he's town now.<br>UT: Same as Lowell, but not quite as strong.<br><br>Magna: I see a lot of scenarios where he is scum. I was shelving him for reasons I don't feel like getting into, but I remember his Kat vote being pretty bad and he seemed to not really care who we lynched between Creature and Implosion. I can see Magna as scum, but not with Creature. Also, I know it's lame but considering his reputation, the old \"why is he alive on Day 3\" is ringing in the back of my mind.<br>Snark: Again, he has a lot of scenarios where he fits as scum. I could see myself PoEing him as scum at the very least.<br><br>Creature: I'm not one for info lynches, but I see a lot depends on his flip just based on his Day 2 wagon. I mean other people's flips help sort him too so I'm not going to advocate lynching him just to get his flip. As for what has changed in my read on him though, I'm open to the idea that he was scum. I started to see it a little on Day 2, but there are definitely scenarios where he fits now. If he is town though, we've been pretty awful so far.<br><br>What hasn't changed in my reads:<br><strike>BBT</strike> Aris - He's town. The replace out. He just is.<br>Shea - Kage confirmed him as town<br>Drmy - Maybe I'm tunneling, but it's hard to see him being town.</div></blockquote>"}

Makes indications he\u2019d like an alternate wagon (like <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7907716#p7907716\">729</a>) but never hard commits to actually pushing in that direction.  Can\u2019t decide if he doesn\u2019t want to get called out for attempting to derail a partner wagon or not.<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7918296#p7918296\">782</a> is pretty scummy if you ask me.  He agrees with KMD\u2019s assertion that Snarky is scummy for voting Lowell while not having his name in Snarky\u2019s ISO to that point.  Meanwhile Arist has had no interactions with Lowell either.  And he expresses dismay at how quick Lowell got to L-1.<br><br>He then pushes that Snarky should be lynched because he is Anti-Town at best and that he must die before LYLO.   And then that Lowell is scummy for having a bad ISO.  Says he would support either lynch without pushing either.<br><br>The following is telling to me \u2013<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7926753#p7926753\" class=\"postlink\">post 823</a>, Aristophanes wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7926693#p7926693\" class=\"postlink\">post 820</a>, Creature wrote:</cite>I am fine with the hammer.<br><br>I want to see the neighborhood.</div></blockquote><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Lowell</span><br><br>Town said to, so I'm happy! <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\"></div></blockquote><br><br>So Creature is basically confirmed Town to Lowell.   It is also convienent that he cuts off discussion before KMD can catch up \u2026"}

Neither occupants of the slot pushed on Shotty or Lowell in any degree.  In fact BBT's ISO where he claimed Snarky was scum for pushing him doesn't jibe with his treatment of Shotty despite what he wrote.   He was completely anti-Shotty lynch and didn't get onto Lowell until after it was basically a done deal.<br><br>KMD's BBT is Town for replacing out meta I'm not going to lean on at all at this stage.<br><br>Damn it ..."}

Being careful in MYLO / LYLO isn\u2019t nearly out of the question for scum.   Until the point people actually drop a vote pretending to be cautious is in scum\u2019s best interest.

The difference between them is that one of them floated \u201cUntrod is scum\u201d and the other didn\u2019t.  Maybe a tad of confirm-bais.

I was one of the setup reviewers, and want to know whether I did a good job here.<br><br>In particular, this setup has something of a Stoofer's Third Law element going on. Town have quite a few moderately powerful power roles, and would be overpowered if all their roles worked at their full potential, but that's balanced by the potential for them to trip over each other (something that I felt was happening while reading through the game). This is something I don't see that often in Mini Normals all that much, so it made the setup interesting to review. (It's also interesting to notice that the setup started in quite a different place and morphed into this one over time.)<br><br>In case anyone is interested, the review thread is <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=90&amp;t=65628\" class=\"postlink\">here</a>."}

Which turned out to be a non-issue except for ironically the neighborizer being confirmed town for being too weak to be a scum role."}
