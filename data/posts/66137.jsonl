All <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=6470\" class=\"postlink\">site rules</a> apply.<br>\n2. Be nice. Mafia games can get heated but remember never to attack the person.<br>\n3. Play to your wincon.<br>\n4. Days are approximately 14 days long, nights are approximately 48 hours long. Extensions may be given the circumstances warrant it.<br>\n5. Failure to post at least once every 48 hours will result in a prod. If you do not pick up your prod in 24 hours, or if I have to prod you a third time, I will look for a replacement.<br>\n6. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Please</div> put votes in this format: <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Something_Smart</span>. Technically, bolded votes are allowed (<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: Something_Smart</div>), but they are a lot harder to see. It's easier for you and easier for me. In case you don't know, you can vote with:<br>\n<div class=\"codebox\"><p>Code: <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"selectCode(this); return false;\">Select all</a></p><pre><code>[vote]Something_Smart[/vote]</code></pre></div><br>\nand unvote with<br>\n<div class=\"codebox\"><p>Code: <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"selectCode(this); return false;\">Select all</a></p><pre><code>[unvote][/unvote]</code></pre></div><br>\nUnvotes are not necessary to change your vote.<br>\n7. If more than half the players are voting for a player, then that player is lynched and removed from the game, and the day will end. If the deadline is reached before a lynch occurs, the day will end without a lynch.<br>\n8. If you have a question for me, put it in bold and say <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">@Mod</div> or <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">@Something_Smart</div>. If it's not something you want made public, feel free to shoot me a PM.<br>\n9. <div style=\"display:inline;color:#FFBF00\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">This lovely shade of yellow (#FFBF00) is the mod color.</div></div> Do not use it. Do not impersonate me.<br>\n10. Do not discuss this game in any other thread except in PTs created specifically for this game. Do not discuss any other ongoing game in this thread.<br>\n11. Do not quote any out-of-thread communications with me or with any other player.<br>\n12. The day after you are lynched or nightkilled, you may make one \"bah!\" post with no game-related information in it.<br>\n13. Do not pretend to break any of these rules. Pretending to break a rule is punishable just as harshly as actually breaking it.<br>\n14. My word is law. Just because it is not stated here does not mean that it is acceptable. I am generally a nice person and will give you a warning if you do something I don't approve of, but it's always better to ask than risk the consequences (see rule 8).<br>\n15. This game is <div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF0000\">3 mafia-aligned players</div> versus <div style=\"display:inline;color:#00FF00\">10 town-aligned players</div>.<br>\n16.

You just fell for one of my favorite trap scum tells. It's called the \"deliberately weak argument.\" How it works is you make an argument and then somewhere in there you throw in a point that is deliberately bad. Easy to refute. It's a motivation tell to determine if someone is arguing in good faith or not. See, town players tend to address the argument in its entirety, because they want to evaluate the argument and they are interested in determining the alignment of the person making it. Scum, however, don't care about that. They are just arguing to score points. They go directly for the deliberately weak argument and attack it, and avoid the rest of the argument entirely.<br>\n<br>\nYou want to know which pattern describes what you just did?<br>\n<br>\nI'll give you a hint. It starts with Sc. And ends with Umfucker.<br>\n<br>\nPlaytime is over. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">confirm vote: katsuki</div>", "time": "Sat Apr 16, 2016 2:08 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=66137&start=100", "forum": "53", "thread": "66137"}

Your response to me didn't help, as you refused to answer my question and attacked me for \"answering your question for him\" which I didn't do. I never answered your question. I attacked you for asking it.<br>\n<br>\n2) I feel like your tone with regards to yourself is wildly different from how you are interacting with other players. You want other people to be accountable for the things they do in thread, which is great, but you don't seem to want to hold yourself to the same standard. You continued to joke vote MoI while attacking other players for not being serious enough. You joke fake claimed. Basically it looked like you were trying to attack players for serious things while, when people called your behavior into question for similar reasons you basically were like \"oh come on its still RVS\"<br>\n<br>\n3) One of the main things I look for in scum reading is what are the motivations of players when they're arguing with you. I wrote a whole long treatise about this in mafia discussion a long time ago. I think there is a fundamental difference in the way that town players and scum players argue. Town players tend to grant the possibility that the person they are arguing with is town, while scum players do not. This leads to different kinds of arguments. A town argument typically involves things like addressing all (or at least most) of the points, conceding arguments that they agree with, looking for other things about the player which are relevant. That is because town are interested in alignment. Scum are not, when they argue it typically looks like someone trying to score points in a debate. They attack weak arguments. They don't give credence to good points. They just simply point and try to make the other person look like an idiot because that makes them look like the \"winner\" of the argument. I feel like your arguing style much more closely aligns with this second pattern in the game then it does the first.<br>\n<br>\n4) More to the point, you fell for a motivation tell that I deliberately threw out there to see who would attack it. You argued not in order to discern my alignment, but rather you attempted to discredit me by going for the low hanging fruit of the deliberately weak argument.<br>\n<br>\n5) Your refusal to seriously claim is deliberately anti town because you're upset. Town refusing to claim (and fake claiming) when they're at l-1 hurts town in general. If you are town, I suggest you cut it out immediately. More importantly, I've seen town use this tactic far less than scum, in the hopes that the refusal to claim will diffuse the bandwagon.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nHope that helps!", "time": "Sat Apr 16, 2016 12:15 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=66137&start=125", "forum": "53", "thread": "66137"}

You basically unvoted for no reason, and when people do that it makes me try to figure out what the reason is. It's not because you think he's likely to get quick lynched out of nowhere. It might be because you don't think the wagon is good, which is clearly also not true, at least from your previous statements. Your unvote then only makes sense to me in the context of hoping that the wagon will sort of diffuse or hoping to be able to get a counter wagon quietly going. Those two options seem way more likely than anything else to me. There simply is no other reason to unvote. Your vague assertion that SS is scummy also adds onto this suspicion, especially given the fact that SS has made exactly 2 of them today, and neither of them have content in them that you could possibly find scummy.

I'm not a fan of that at all. it was unnecessary and feels like a distraction.</div></blockquote><br>\nThis is reasonable; however, it isn't something that I would do as scum for the sake of distracting. I can definitely see a perspective arguing that my unvote was scummy. The reason that I hadn't unvoted earlier was because I was hoping to get a claim from Katsuki, who has now made it clear that that isn't happening. Given that, the vote doesn't really serve any purpose that outweighs the possibility of someone hammering before remaining people give opinions on the wagon (which is even still a big possibility at L-2 given that both shotty and kage have more or less said that they're going to hammer). Especially seeing as this wagon is something that I'd typically expect to be very divisive, but isn't, which makes pre-flip opinions on it from every player valuable.<br>\n<div align=\"center\"><hr style=\"height:14px;width:100%\"></div><br>\nP-edit @Shea: I figured you might say I was buddying you.

If Kats flips town that means that I'll be able to cross off some people from my scum list, most notably implosion, but also a couple of the people who jumped onto the wagon without much justification, as well as Kage, because I don't think hammering in the manner in which they did makes much sense from a scum perspective?<br>\n<br>\n5) On the subject of Kage, I think I would be more comfortable if they replaced out. This is because part of me is focusing on the mental disabilities they mentioned earlier, and I'm hesitant to attack a lot of what they're doing/read it in the way that I typically would because I have those thoughts in the back of my mind. If Kage is scum who hammered his scum buddy there, I would be forced to conclude that they are using claims of mental illness to gain an advantage in the game. I really really really hope this isn't true. As someone who has suffered from mental health issues myself, it would make me blindingly angry. :/ I feel bad saying this but its a relevant part of my post day thought process.<br>\n<br>\nPEDIT Addressed to shotty in particular. When I have the power to make sure we don't lynch by unvoting, how is it \"claiming more power than [1] have\" to say that I will unvote in order to stop a quick hammer?

You just fell for one of my favorite trap scum tells. It's called the \"deliberately weak argument.\" How it works is you make an argument and then somewhere in there you throw in a point that is deliberately bad. Easy to refute. It's a motivation tell to determine if someone is arguing in good faith or not. See, town players tend to address the argument in its entirety, because they want to evaluate the argument and they are interested in determining the alignment of the person making it. Scum, however, don't care about that. They are just arguing to score points. They go directly for the deliberately weak argument and attack it, and avoid the rest of the argument entirely.<br>\n<br>\nYou want to know which pattern describes what you just did?<br>\n<br>\nI'll give you a hint. It starts with Sc. And ends with Umfucker.<br>\n<br>\nPlaytime is over. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">confirm vote: katsuki</div></div></blockquote><br>\nViewing this as towny currently seeing how he's taking the argument.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7844096#p7844096\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7844096#p7844096\" data-post-id=\"7844096\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 104</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=23899\">BlueBloodedToffee</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7841543#p7841543\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7841543#p7841543\" data-post-id=\"7841543\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 35</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=14368\">implosion</a> wrote:</cite><br>\nWalk me through your logic here.</div></blockquote><br>\nWhy so serious?<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7841688#p7841688\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7841688#p7841688\" data-post-id=\"7841688\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 46</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=14368\">implosion</a> wrote:</cite><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: SnarkySnowman</span></div></blockquote><br>\nAlso, if you had a problem with Creature, why did you not vote him and instead continue by RVS'ing SS?<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7843875#p7843875\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7843875#p7843875\" data-post-id=\"7843875\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 94</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=27374\">Creature</a> wrote:</cite><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: xyzzy</span><br>\n<br>\nEverytime I look at their posts I feel they're just trying to look like town.</div></blockquote><br>\nHow so?<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Katsuki</span><br>\n<br>\nLooks good.</div></blockquote><br>\nEmpty vote, but I don't see this coming from scum perspective.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7844125#p7844125\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7844125#p7844125\" data-post-id=\"7844125\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 108</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=12987\">MagnaofIllusion</a> wrote:</cite><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">@Shea </div>- I don't remember so I'm going to ask - do you regularly proxy your vote in Town games to another player pre-game?

You just fell for one of my favorite trap scum tells. It's called the \"deliberately weak argument.\" How it works is you make an argument and then somewhere in there you throw in a point that is deliberately bad. Easy to refute. It's a motivation tell to determine if someone is arguing in good faith or not. See, town players tend to address the argument in its entirety, because they want to evaluate the argument and they are interested in determining the alignment of the person making it. Scum, however, don't care about that. They are just arguing to score points. They go directly for the deliberately weak argument and attack it, and avoid the rest of the argument entirely.<br>\n<br>\nYou want to know which pattern describes what you just did?<br>\n<br>\nI'll give you a hint.

Now, I'm sure this is all outdated. We'll see though.<br>\n<br>\nSo I saw spoilers when I was trying to find where I was and stuff and I know Kat got lynched. For what it's worth, I have no problem with the questions toward kage. The only thing that stands out as possibly scummy is \"you know I'm going to claim power role\" because it's phrased in a way that emphasizes the claim rather than the role itself. It looks like an attempt to stop the wagon, not an honest \"hey guys I'm useful\". I have slight  doubts about that though because it immediately followed \"I'm not claiming because the wagon is shit\" but that kind of feels softclaimy too. I dunno, I guess it doesn't matter at this point, but hopefully Kat is scum. I'd think a power role would come right out and say \"hold up, don't lynch me\".<br>\n<br>\nKage and Creature both feel town to me.<br>\n<br>\nLowell, why the town reads on BBT and Magna?<br>\n<br>\nSomething feels fake about Shea questioning BBT's Kat vote. I get that he's after BBT's motivations, but he never comes close to questioning his own Kat read based on it. I mean maybe he did later, I'm only on Page 6, but nothing like that at all so far. Post 138 also describes exactly how bussing works and then acts like it's a ridiculous concept which I don't like.<br>\n<br>\nImplosion is looking townier now, especially if Kat and Shea both turn out to be scum.<br>\n<br>\nYeah, Kage is obvtown at this point.<br>\n<br>\nXyzzy, yeah I do a few different things in the early game and I'm not even sure what makes me decide to do one over the others. In this game, it was the \"make it clear my votes are serious but don't explain so we can see who asks\" and only Creature did. Unfortunately, that was followed by a 40 hour work week crammed into 3 days immediately followed by a lynch and now I'm rushing my catch up. Anyone who has played with me knows I'm pretty active typically and that's true regardless of alignment.<br>\n<br>\nI've read up to the hammer and mostly just want to make sure I beat the Mod to the submit button so I'll post this as is for now and if I have anything to say to twilight stuff, that will follow shortly.

You just fell for one of my favorite trap scum tells. It's called the \"deliberately weak argument.\" How it works is you make an argument and then somewhere in there you throw in a point that is deliberately bad. Easy to refute. It's a motivation tell to determine if someone is arguing in good faith or not. See, town players tend to address the argument in its entirety, because they want to evaluate the argument and they are interested in determining the alignment of the person making it. Scum, however, don't care about that. They are just arguing to score points. They go directly for the deliberately weak argument and attack it, and avoid the rest of the argument entirely.<br>\n<br>\nYou want to know which pattern describes what you just did?<br>\n<br>\nI'll give you a hint. It starts with Sc.

The whole \"please don't townread me for this, it's null\" is a good example. Kat was the one who asked this. If any living players want me to, I'll go back and quote every single one. If not, there's where that was coming from<br>\n-why does a town Kat mean drmy needs a snap vote Day 2?<br>\n---The L-1 vote felt too excited and opportunistic, especially the way he said Kat was \"obviously\" scum. I think drmy loved the idea that we could lynch a claimed power role and jumped at it. And this came right after Shea unvoted, saying we need more time. So drmy may have been worried the lynch would slip away.<br>\n<br>\nKage's claim at the Day 2 start is another example of genuine vibes. Was it the right play to claim an innocent so soon? No. Of course not. But why would scum do it? Kage is clearly town. Shea is town as a result. Anyone who disagrees better have a damn good reason. If I'm a protective role, I'll be on Kage tonight. Kage, future reference, you should hold off on that claim unless votes actually start piling up on you and/or Shea. Just saying he's town would have been fine. If people aren't ok with that, you always have the claim in your back pocket.<br>\n<br>\nImplosion, how are you townreading me when I was away for most of Day 1?

But the day's just started and I'm willing to give people some time before demanding content or follow-ups. In a sense I thought his post was townish for the exact opposite reason that Lowell decried it as scummy: he gave reads on specific people on the wagon without really decrying the wagon or calling it good, in a way that was disconnected from what Katsuki was going to flip. It makes sense from the perspective of town who suspected Katsuki might likely flip town but didn't know. Looking over it again it isn't that strong, I suppose - it still gives me some gut townvibes however in addition to what I've said.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7858595#p7858595\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7858595#p7858595\" data-post-id=\"7858595\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 371</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9546\">Kmd4390</a> wrote:</cite><br>\nImplosion, how are you townreading me when I was away for most of Day 1?

Now, I'm sure this is all outdated. We'll see though.<br>\n<br>\nSo I saw spoilers when I was trying to find where I was and stuff and I know Kat got lynched. For what it's worth, I have no problem with the questions toward kage. The only thing that stands out as possibly scummy is \"you know I'm going to claim power role\" because it's phrased in a way that emphasizes the claim rather than the role itself. It looks like an attempt to stop the wagon, not an honest \"hey guys I'm useful\". I have slight  doubts about that though because it immediately followed \"I'm not claiming because the wagon is shit\" but that kind of feels softclaimy too. I dunno, I guess it doesn't matter at this point, but hopefully Kat is scum. I'd think a power role would come right out and say \"hold up, don't lynch me\".<br>\n<br>\nKage and Creature both feel town to me.<br>\n<br>\nLowell, why the town reads on BBT and Magna?<br>\n<br>\nSomething feels fake about Shea questioning BBT's Kat vote. I get that he's after BBT's motivations, but he never comes close to questioning his own Kat read based on it. I mean maybe he did later, I'm only on Page 6, but nothing like that at all so far. Post 138 also describes exactly how bussing works and then acts like it's a ridiculous concept which I don't like.<br>\n<br>\nImplosion is looking townier now, especially if Kat and Shea both turn out to be scum.<br>\n<br>\nYeah, Kage is obvtown at this point.<br>\n<br>\nXyzzy, yeah I do a few different things in the early game and I'm not even sure what makes me decide to do one over the others. In this game, it was the \"make it clear my votes are serious but don't explain so we can see who asks\" and only Creature did. Unfortunately, that was followed by a 40 hour work week crammed into 3 days immediately followed by a lynch and now I'm rushing my catch up.

The analysis-without-catching-up thing is something that I always see people calling wifom on but I've always empirically seen things like that (townslips and the like) coming more from town. BBT's certainly an experienced enough player to fake something like that but I see it as somewhat unlikely. <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>BBT wrote:</cite><br>\nI don't like this fro implosion for why he is voting Katsuki - I don't remember seeing any inconsistencies. What makes inconsistencies scummy? It feels like he is trying to overly justify his Katsuki vote and he does this by stating Katsuki is being anti-town (note: not scummy).</div></blockquote><br>\nPretty sure I explained both the inconsistencies and why they were scummy; see my ISO. The point that a fair bit of my justification was because of anti-townness is fair. Frankly the possibility of Katsuki being town who was refusing to play pretty much objectively in a way in the town's interest was also pushing me somewhat to vote him. That kind of thing really annoys me. <br>\n<br>\nI don't like shotty's push on BBT for a different reason from him actually. Shotty is correct (you can scumhunt in posts where you don't state reads); however his posts in the discussion have an air of caught-for-the-wrong-reasons. BBT defending himself argumentatively is also a really bad reason to scumread him; plenty of players will counter any argument made that they disagree with. It feels kind of like shotty thinks bbt is going to be an easy vote to justify (or an easy place to apply pressure) because his catchup is awkward given the not knowing who died.<br>\n<br>\nRegardless from that:<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Unvote</div><br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Snarky</span><br>\n<br>\nMy vote is probably going to remain parked here until he gives any semblance of actual content (i.e. a justification for anything he's ever said). <br>\n<br>\nI also don't really feel like Lowell is particularly scummy anymore.

I get a defensive vibe from your posts. The fact that I vote you and you say \"but I'm scumhunting\" is weird. As I'm reading up, I also like BBT's pointing out that you poked at him for something pretty null. About that last one by the way, you keep saying you asked it to scumhunt. Can you be more specific? Like what were you expecting as an answer that might tell you anything about his alignment. <br>\n<br>\nBBT, Creature is a meta read. He prefers town and his scum entrances lack confidence. Here, he feels confident even as he's being put down. And the motivation in his posts, even if weak, feels town.

Because there is no way to actually get a read from a vote that is independent of alignment IMO.[/quote]<br>\nDisagree. You can read player x as townish for their vote on player y in a vacuum regardless of player y's alignment. In fact the only way it even makes sense in such a case that player x's alignment is predicated on player y's alignment is because of conditional probabilities. Apart from that, if player x is town, then player x is going to make the same arguments towards player y whether player y is <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">actually</div> town or <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">actually</div> scum; it's just a matter of what player x is perceiving player y to be. Therefore we have to read the vote in a vacuum to some degree. But overall this is a somewhat moot point because like some of the other arguments I've made it doesn't matter if you don't think you can get a read from a vote that is independent of alignment because other players (i.e. Creature) may believe that they can. My Creature townread was deteriorating as he didn't seem to be providing any reasoning apart from the (IMO) very poor post directed towards me but I suspect the townslip in 464 was not faked so he's back to town for a different reason now.<br>\n<br>\nShotty attacking Creature feels bad for a similar reason to shotty attacking bbt. I really cannot see \"Creature didn't see who died -&gt; he must either be conspiring with bbt or trying to fake it himself separately\" being a likely thought process from town. There's no way (or at least it seems extremely unlikely) that two scum would conspire together to both townslip. I just don't see that being a likely thing that scum would decide to do in a game like this where I think there is probably the impression that most of the player list is going to be highly skeptical of townslips and the like (although I am less skeptical than most people). In particular the incredulity that Shotty displays in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7869559#p7869559\">470</a> feels really disingenuous; \"scum don't care\" is not true, scum just already know who died.

You've done this at least twice now and Lowell has done it at least once as well. This is deeply flawed because you're projecting your particular version of how town plays on to me. I consider a snarky vote more important than a shotty vote right now because snarky is almost completely opaque. He continues to do nothing to justify his reads or make himself remotely readable halfway through day two. I see this as a massive problem for a town in which the majority of players have been contributing well; we very simply cannot allow snarky to be a lurker to the degree he is now or it has a strong chance of coming back to bite us (if he's town and we lynch the lurker on d4 or whenever, or if he's scum and we just let him get away with never justifying anything). I view getting readable content from snarky as a higher priority than voting for shotty.<br>\n<br>\nSaying my holding my vote as a policy on snarky \"isn't consistent with town play\" is wrong for two reasons: one, you're calling it inconsistent with <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">your version</div> of town play which is very different from mine, and I as town am going to be playing by the maxims that I view to govern good town play, not those that you do. Two (although I can't quite tell if you're doing this based on your wording), even if your vision of \"consistent with town play\" were in some sense objectively right you'd be implying that town will always play according to that objective standard (which I think a very brief review of yesterday will prove wrong). <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>And his reads-list doesn&#8217;t really sort of align in my mind &#8211; I&#8217;m lumped into the group of &#8216;maybe scum&#8217; (Untrod who he addresses directly) even though clearly implosion states he has no read on me aka I should be Null.

No reason for me to assume that your posted a reads list and that prompted you to go back and look at UT and not the other way around &#8230; that you were explaining your read on UT in the further discussion.  Do you think it isn&#8217;t a reasonable assumption for readers to make?<br>\n<br>\n2 / 3.  I&#8217;m not sure your point here &#8211; I&#8217;m specifically pointing out that you basically are avoiding actually making a read on me under the guise of &#8220;I can&#8217;t do it&#8221;.   Unlike those mentioned players who you have already committed to a Town read on (and for the record &#8211; many for reasons that are at best fluff).  You are specifically abdicating a read on my slot under the &#8220;It&#8217;s Hard&#8221; doctrine which I see as a fence-sitting position that is easy to evacuate from when the need arises.

Hell, BBT/Magna probably shouldn't both be town here. However, BBT is town for the replace out.

However, confirmed town jumped off. Drmy switched to BBT alone. And UT stayed. So it's not like anything huge came from it. The day became Implosion vs Creature and no one on the Lowell wagon did anything to change it to that, so *shrug*. Maybe you can argue that because Implosion flipped town, it makes Creature more likely scum, but that feels like a stretch just based on these two votes. I remember him getting more though so maybe that will have some merit before I'm done here.<br>\n<br>\nCreature (4)- Lowell, MagnaofIllusion, drmyshottyizsik, <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:green\">Thestatusquo</div></div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:green\">implosion</div></div> (2)- SnarkySnowman, BlueBloodedToffee<br>\nSnarkySnowman (2)- <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:green\">implosion</div></div>, Untrod Tripod<br>\ndrmyshottyizsik (1)- Kmd4390<br>\n<br>\nSo. Three scenarios:<br>\nScenario 1 - Creature is town. In this case, scum don't have any reason to worry unless Snark is scum. Let's do Snark town first. Scum are probably spread out among the three wagons. So one of Lowell/Magna/drmy, BBT, and UT. I'm not really finding this scenario likely.<br>\nScenario 2 - Same as the first, but with Snark as scum. In this one, UT is probably town and Snark's buddies are on the Creature wagon (Lowell, Magna, Drmy). Because Drmy was on the earlier Lowell wagon, either he was bussing or Magna is scum. In this scenario, scum is likely to shift to the Implosion mislynch later.<br>\nScenario 3 - Creature is scum. Watch for scum to jump all over the Implosion wagon in this case. UT and Snark look bad in this scenario for the simple fact of being off the Creature wagon. (Sorry, I know confirmation bias is showing on BBT but he belongs in this group too technically.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:green\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">implosion</div></div> (5)- SnarkySnowman, BlueBloodedToffee, Kmd4390, MagnaofIllusion,Creature&#160;(L-1)<br>\nCreature (3)- Lowell, drmyshottyizsik, <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:green\">Thestatusquo</div></div><br>\nSnarkySnowman (2)-<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:green\"> implosion</div></div>, Untrod Tripod<br>\n<br>\nOk let's make sense of what happened here. I joined the Implosion wagon and was immediately joined by Magna (who was voting Creature) and Creature (who voted out of self preservation regardless of his own alignment). So, again, Creature's flip is critical to a legitimate analysis, but let's try the scenario game again:<br>\nScenario 1 - Creature is town. Magna is likely scum who jumped ship. Snark was likely scum already on the wagon and Lowell or drmy stayed put on Creature.<br>\nScenario 2 - Creature is scum. Snark still looks bad tbh. And someone is bussing somewhere. Creature town looks more likely I think.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:green\">implosion</div></div> (6)- SnarkySnowman, Kmd4390, Creature, Aristophanes, Untrod Tripod, drmyshottyizsik&#160;(LYNCH)<br>\nCreature (3)- Lowell, <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:green\">Thestatusquo, I Am Innocent</div></div><br>\ndrmyshottyizsik (1)- <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:green\">implosion</div></div><br>\n<br>\nAnd we end up here. Either Magna and Lowell are BOTH scum who managed to stay off the wagon or this lynch is absolutely loaded with scum. It could be as simple as 2-3 of Snark/UT/drmy with 0-1 of Lowell/Magna or I could be wrong about Creature which explains scum's interest in the Implosion lynch (Creature/Snark/drmy?). I do remember UT hanging on to his Snark vote and only voting implosion to avoid no lynch and unlike drmy, he feels consistent in saying that. So Snark and drmy look like scum if Creature is town and one of Lowell/Magna would be a partner.<br>\n<br>\nConclusion<br>\nSo basically here's what has changed in my reads:<br>\nLowell: I wasn't entirely sure where to put him before, but I'm confident he's town now.<br>\nUT: Same as Lowell, but not quite as strong.<br>\n<br>\nMagna: I see a lot of scenarios where he is scum. I was shelving him for reasons I don't feel like getting into, but I remember his Kat vote being pretty bad and he seemed to not really care who we lynched between Creature and Implosion. I can see Magna as scum, but not with Creature. Also, I know it's lame but considering his reputation, the old \"why is he alive on Day 3\" is ringing in the back of my mind.<br>\nSnark: Again, he has a lot of scenarios where he fits as scum. I could see myself PoEing him as scum at the very least.<br>\n<br>\nCreature: I'm not one for info lynches, but I see a lot depends on his flip just based on his Day 2 wagon. I mean other people's flips help sort him too so I'm not going to advocate lynching him just to get his flip. As for what has changed in my read on him though, I'm open to the idea that he was scum. I started to see it a little on Day 2, but there are definitely scenarios where he fits now. If he is town though, we've been pretty awful so far.<br>\n<br>\nWhat hasn't changed in my reads:<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline-flex;text-decoration:line-through\">BBT</div> Aris - He's town. The replace out. He just is.<br>\nShea - Kage confirmed him as town<br>\nDrmy - Maybe I'm tunneling, but it's hard to see him being town.", "time": "Fri May 06, 2016 12:45 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=66137&start=700", "forum": "53", "thread": "66137"}

However, confirmed town jumped off. Drmy switched to BBT alone. And UT stayed. So it's not like anything huge came from it. The day became Implosion vs Creature and no one on the Lowell wagon did anything to change it to that, so *shrug*. Maybe you can argue that because Implosion flipped town, it makes Creature more likely scum, but that feels like a stretch just based on these two votes. I remember him getting more though so maybe that will have some merit before I'm done here.<br>\n<br>\nCreature (4)- Lowell, MagnaofIllusion, drmyshottyizsik, <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:green\">Thestatusquo</div></div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:green\">implosion</div></div> (2)- SnarkySnowman, BlueBloodedToffee<br>\nSnarkySnowman (2)- <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:green\">implosion</div></div>, Untrod Tripod<br>\ndrmyshottyizsik (1)- Kmd4390<br>\n<br>\nSo. Three scenarios:<br>\nScenario 1 - Creature is town. In this case, scum don't have any reason to worry unless Snark is scum. Let's do Snark town first. Scum are probably spread out among the three wagons. So one of Lowell/Magna/drmy, BBT, and UT. I'm not really finding this scenario likely.<br>\nScenario 2 - Same as the first, but with Snark as scum. In this one, UT is probably town and Snark's buddies are on the Creature wagon (Lowell, Magna, Drmy). Because Drmy was on the earlier Lowell wagon, either he was bussing or Magna is scum. In this scenario, scum is likely to shift to the Implosion mislynch later.<br>\nScenario 3 - Creature is scum. Watch for scum to jump all over the Implosion wagon in this case. UT and Snark look bad in this scenario for the simple fact of being off the Creature wagon. (Sorry, I know confirmation bias is showing on BBT but he belongs in this group too technically.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:green\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">implosion</div></div> (5)- SnarkySnowman, BlueBloodedToffee, Kmd4390, MagnaofIllusion,Creature&#160;(L-1)<br>\nCreature (3)- Lowell, drmyshottyizsik, <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:green\">Thestatusquo</div></div><br>\nSnarkySnowman (2)-<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:green\"> implosion</div></div>, Untrod Tripod<br>\n<br>\nOk let's make sense of what happened here. I joined the Implosion wagon and was immediately joined by Magna (who was voting Creature) and Creature (who voted out of self preservation regardless of his own alignment). So, again, Creature's flip is critical to a legitimate analysis, but let's try the scenario game again:<br>\nScenario 1 - Creature is town. Magna is likely scum who jumped ship. Snark was likely scum already on the wagon and Lowell or drmy stayed put on Creature.<br>\nScenario 2 - Creature is scum. Snark still looks bad tbh. And someone is bussing somewhere. Creature town looks more likely I think.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:green\">implosion</div></div> (6)- SnarkySnowman, Kmd4390, Creature, Aristophanes, Untrod Tripod, drmyshottyizsik&#160;(LYNCH)<br>\nCreature (3)- Lowell, <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:green\">Thestatusquo, I Am Innocent</div></div><br>\ndrmyshottyizsik (1)- <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:green\">implosion</div></div><br>\n<br>\nAnd we end up here. Either Magna and Lowell are BOTH scum who managed to stay off the wagon or this lynch is absolutely loaded with scum. It could be as simple as 2-3 of Snark/UT/drmy with 0-1 of Lowell/Magna or I could be wrong about Creature which explains scum's interest in the Implosion lynch (Creature/Snark/drmy?). I do remember UT hanging on to his Snark vote and only voting implosion to avoid no lynch and unlike drmy, he feels consistent in saying that. So Snark and drmy look like scum if Creature is town and one of Lowell/Magna would be a partner.<br>\n<br>\nConclusion<br>\nSo basically here's what has changed in my reads:<br>\nLowell: I wasn't entirely sure where to put him before, but I'm confident he's town now.<br>\nUT: Same as Lowell, but not quite as strong.<br>\n<br>\nMagna: I see a lot of scenarios where he is scum. I was shelving him for reasons I don't feel like getting into, but I remember his Kat vote being pretty bad and he seemed to not really care who we lynched between Creature and Implosion. I can see Magna as scum, but not with Creature. Also, I know it's lame but considering his reputation, the old \"why is he alive on Day 3\" is ringing in the back of my mind.<br>\nSnark: Again, he has a lot of scenarios where he fits as scum. I could see myself PoEing him as scum at the very least.<br>\n<br>\nCreature: I'm not one for info lynches, but I see a lot depends on his flip just based on his Day 2 wagon. I mean other people's flips help sort him too so I'm not going to advocate lynching him just to get his flip. As for what has changed in my read on him though, I'm open to the idea that he was scum. I started to see it a little on Day 2, but there are definitely scenarios where he fits now. If he is town though, we've been pretty awful so far.<br>\n<br>\nWhat hasn't changed in my reads:<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline-flex;text-decoration:line-through\">BBT</div> Aris - He's town. The replace out.

Has some very weak interactions with Shotty around this point where Shotty doesn&#8217;t accuse him of being scum for it but says he will &#8220;keep his eye on BBT&#8221;. <br>\n<br>\nYet right afterwards BBT falls on either Snarky or Implosion as his preferred lynches.<br>\n<br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7867081#p7867081\">453</a> strikes me as off.  He&#8217;s just had a lengthy back and forth with Shotty where he repeatedly references Shotty&#8217;s play as not scum-hunting and then says &#8220;I&#8217;ll lynch you after Implosion&#8221;.<br>\n<br>\nBBT then replaces out.<br>\n<br>\nFirst post of Arist that twigs me is <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7886338#p7886338\">570</a> &#8211; uggh this is so textbook &#8220;Scum wanting to be outraged at a loss of a Town power-role posturing&#8221;  &#8230; so textbook I&#8217;m second guessing my gut reaction as I type this.  <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7890645#p7890645\">620</a> is on the exact same theme &#8220;Why did newb claim his investigation I&#8217;m SOOOO upset&#8221;<br>\n<br>\nArist&#8217;s first vote is Implosion.<br>\n<br>\nDefends Shotty&#8217;s hammer as not coming from scum at <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7890803#p7890803\">638</a>.  Some mild back and forth with Shotty about Traitor Mafia&#8217;s set-up and its implications for reading Snarky.<br>\n<br>\nDoes some buddying to Shotty starting around <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7898870#p7898870\">678</a>.  I meta ISOed him because of this and came back with mixed results.  He had actively buddied partners in the past but they tended to be stronger players like Radiant who he also buddied as Town.  I wrote it off as Non-Alignment indicative at the time.<br>\n<br>\nAvoids voting Shotty during Day 3.  Makes indications he&#8217;d like an alternate wagon (like <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7907716#p7907716\">729</a>) but never hard commits to actually pushing in that direction.  Can&#8217;t decide if he doesn&#8217;t want to get called out for attempting to derail a partner wagon or not.<br>\n<br>\n<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7918296#p7918296\">782</a> is pretty scummy if you ask me.  He agrees with KMD&#8217;s assertion that Snarky is scummy for voting Lowell while not having his name in Snarky&#8217;s ISO to that point.  Meanwhile Arist has had no interactions with Lowell either.  And he expresses dismay at how quick Lowell got to L-1.<br>\n<br>\nHe then pushes that Snarky should be lynched because he is Anti-Town at best and that he must die before LYLO.   And then that Lowell is scummy for having a bad ISO.  Says he would support either lynch without pushing either.<br>\n<br>\nThe following is telling to me &#8211;<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7926753#p7926753\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7926753#p7926753\" data-post-id=\"7926753\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 823</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=25129\">Aristophanes</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7926693#p7926693\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7926693#p7926693\" data-post-id=\"7926693\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 820</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=27374\">Creature</a> wrote:</cite>I am fine with the hammer.<br>\n<br>\nI want to see the neighborhood.</div></blockquote><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Lowell</span><br>\n<br>\nTown said to, so I'm happy! <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\"></div></blockquote>\n\nSo Creature is basically confirmed Town to Lowell.

He&#8217;s trying to float a Strongman Neighbor in a set-up where every other flipped role is single Utility (Neopol / Rolestopper / Roleblocker / 1 Shot Encryptor).  <br>\n<br>\nAnd I&#8217;ve already mentioned why his &#8220;VCA says Magna / only this VCA doesn&#8217;t say Magna&#8221; song and dance also makes no sense.<br>\n<br>\nI mean &#8230; you may excuse this as maybe paranoid and poor Town play.  If that&#8217;s the case you aren&#8217;t even considering that Creature might be capable of that also.  The difference between them is that one of them floated &#8220;Untrod is scum&#8221; and the other didn&#8217;t.  Maybe a tad of confirm-bais.
