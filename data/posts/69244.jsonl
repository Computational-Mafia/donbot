{"number": 1, "id": "8525941", "user": "Dierfire", "user_id": "25388", "content": "<div style=\"text-align:center\">RULES</div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">General</div></div><br>\n01. Site rules may be found <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=6470\" class=\"postlink\">here</a> for reference. Note that playing to win condition is a requirement.<br>\n02. The rules are subject to change at my discretion to correct any errors or omissions. Should any changes be implemented, they will be announced in the same format as the original rule (for example, changes to the main set of rules will be announced in the main thread; changes to role-specific rules will be sent by PM).<br>\n03. Pretending to violate any of these rules will be treated the same as an actual violation.<br>\n04. Everyone is here to have fun, and I hope that we will all keep this in mind throughout the game. Please contact me directly (by PM) with any problems or questions. In the event that I make an error, please call it to my attention by PM or by addressing me in the relevant thread (<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">I will look for &#8220;@Mod&#8221;</div>).<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Posting</div></div><br>\n05. Players should use English exclusively, without any form of hidden or encoded text.<br>\n06. Once I have declared a player to be dead, that player should not post in the main thread until I have declared the game to be over.<br>\n07. Players should not provide direct quotations from, images of, or other provable references to any game-related PM or PT.<br>\n08. Players should not use any form of provable randomness for any reason.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Timing</div></div><br>\n09. Each Day Phase will last 240 hours. Each Night Phase will last 48 hours. Deadlines may be extended at my discretion as necessary to ensure that the game continues smoothly. Any such extension will be announced in the main thread.<br>\n10. Players who have not posted in 48 consecutive hours will receive a prod. After receiving a prod, a player has 24 hours to post before I will begin seeking a replacement. Players on V/LA will be exempt from these prod requirements; however, if a player requires an extensive period of V/LA, I may determine that the game would be better served by a replacement and replace that player at my discretion.<br>\n11. Players who do not make sufficient attempt to participate (including--but not limited to--players who require repeated prods) may be replaced at my discretion.<br>\n12. If a player being replaced for inactivity should return to the game before a replacement is found, that player may be allowed to continue in the game at my discretion. However, once a player has been replaced, that player may not continue in the game.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Day Phase</div></div><br>\n13. Players may vote to lynch another player using either vote tags or bold tags as demonstrated below.<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Name</span><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: Name</div><br>\nIn order to be counted, votes should appear on a separate line and not within spoiler tags or otherwise concealed. Votes not following this format may be counted if I believe that a vote was intended.<br>\n14. When one player has achieved a majority of votes (more living players voting for that player than living players not voting for that player), that player will be lynched and the phase will end. If the deadline is reached before a lynch is achieved, no player will be lynched.<br>\n15. Players may vote to end the phase without a lynch. An example of such a vote is given below:<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: No Lynch</span><br>\nIf the number of living players voting for this option is greater than or equal to the number of living players not voting for this option, the phase will end without a lynch and the game will proceed directly to Night Phase.<br>\n16. Players may continue to post in the main thread until I have announced the end of the phase, regardless of whether or not a lynch has occurred.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Game Design</div></div><br>\n17. In addition to the site-wide rules, it may be useful to review the <a href=\"http://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Normal_Game\" class=\"postlink\">Normal Game guidelines</a> and the <a href=\"http://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Natural_Action_Resolution/Normal_Game\" class=\"postlink\">Natural Action Resolution guidelines</a>.<br>\n18. Any PT associated with this game will be open for use at all times (Day Phase and Night Phase). <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Every PT related to this game will be made public after the game is over, although I will redact posts by player request.</div><br>\n19. No player may perform more than one action during a single Night Phase.<br>\n20. At least one player will receive the following role:\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div> Welcome, (player), to Mini Normal 1854!<br>\n<br>\nYour role is Citizen, aligned with <div style=\"display:inline;color:green\">Town</div>.<br>\n<br>\nAbilities: You have no special abilities.<br>\n<br>\nVictory: You win if all living players are aligned with Town.</div></blockquote>", "time": "Fri Nov 18, 2016 8:18 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=69244&start=0", "forum": "53", "thread": "69244"}

Which I don't really agree with but that's OK - I can't agree with the above logic for two reasons:<br>\n<br>\n1) There's a question about Eric's reads...in the same post that he votes Eric - that's clearly voting without all of the information in mind. With the other cases, the other people didn't care about the reads. Why would his reads have any affect on your vote? It's literally the most useless question I can think of if you're going to vote him in the SAME post.<br>\n<br>\n2) There's a clear misunderstanding that if you're not following /my/ mindset, you're not on /my/ team.

The things he says and does are still fair game for assessing his alignment.  I'm not and haven't been willing to just discard him for being new to this site.

Except, Gamma only shows intent to vote Eric but doesn't do it. There's even a flip-flop on Eric between 185 and 384. Not enough for anyone to question it but there's certainly uncertainty that Gamma is town-reading Eric. In fact, if anything, there's a clear slideline provision there. But the fact that he's going to OK Havingfitz for some of the same things that Eric has literally done puts me at an unease.<br>\n<br>\n3) Ari:<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8546586#p8546586\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8546586#p8546586\" data-post-id=\"8546586\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 413</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=25129\">Aristophanes</a> wrote:</cite>I mean like \"You voted a Mason before they claimed!

The fact this is toward TwoFace before the vote and then he votes TwoFace after listing multiple scumreads - especially with TwoFace arguably being the weakest of the bunch - is very weird. There's some sort of tunnel vision that Fitz is applying and it's not great. Started with Io in the beginning to a small degree, now it's straight onto TwoFace.<br>\n<br>\nI also think that the response to me in 358 says a lot about Fitz's opinions of the game rather than opinions in general.

The fact that Fitz can't distinguish that some one, who is new, cannot have a different playstyle that would react differently to the overall alignment of a player is just straight up not true.

Eric had ~3...  Ari had 3.   Simply casting a vote or suspicions on a mason count not = a player being scum and was never said to equal that.  Your continued focus on that one inaccurate assertion shows your case on me is baseless.<br>\n<br>\nQuestion to you TwoFace.

I do not spend a lot of time defending people I do not 100% know are town.  And my comments on LUV aren't so much a defense of TVD as they are a criticism for a very bad post by LUV.

And I already answered your question about me suspecting you for your naked vote on Misa.  I did not.  I mentioned you made a naked vote on a mason.  Take out the word naked if you want.

Now, typically, meta'ing after a single game is foolish and silly, but there's a big enough difference between the two games where it's definitely something I think we should talk about. There's also the matter of Frank's lack of time in this game is probably genuine which eats into the significance of this a bit but even when he's had a bit of time he's reached nothing close to the production he reached in that game and I think it's because he's uncomfortable with playing scum.<br>\n<br>\nAs far as body of work goes, Frank seems a hell of a lot more invested in 1744 than he does here, even from the beginning; whereas our Frank focuses on what's anti-town and throws out reads without backing them up at all, 1744 Frank questions early, and when he provides a scumread, provides decent backing to go along with it. Also of note is that during this game Frank goes through a hurricane that takes away computer access and when he comes back he has a catchup that is a great deal less underwhelming than the catchup we got here (compare <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8430409#p8430409\" class=\"postlink\">this</a> and <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8430917#p8430917\" class=\"postlink\">this</a> with the atrociousness that we were subjected to).<br>\n<br>\nNow, as for game related posts... <br>\n<br>\nFirst of all, he has 30 posts this game. 10 of them are promises of more content. Now, that people don't have time and all, but the fact that dodging posting in the game is a third of his posting is the part where prod dodging veers from annoying into alignment-indicative; compounded with the fact that whenever he does post content it's violently underwhelming, I don't really think there's a chance that he's town here.<br>\n<br>\nAnother good chunk of his posts are posts that aren't promises, but posts that aren't alignment-indicative; <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8532535#p8532535\" class=\"postlink\">58</a> and <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8532546#p8532546\" class=\"postlink\">60</a> are two posts dealing with why he thinks something is anti-town and thus has nothing to do with alignment, <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8532557#p8532557\" class=\"postlink\">61</a> is discussing alt identity and thus has nothing to do with alignment, <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8532701#p8532701\" class=\"postlink\">67</a> is talking about how discussing TVD's alt-identity is antitown and thus has nothing to do with alignment, <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8532805#p8532805\" class=\"postlink\">82</a> and <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8532858#p8532858\" class=\"postlink\">86</a> are two Frank posts where he talks about why discussing whether TVD is an alt or not is useless and thus has nothing to do with alignment.<br>\n<br>\nThe rest of his posts are half-baked reads; he townreads Hikari because \"a couple posts look townish\" and spend a large part of his time talking about how he doesn't see how people are scumreading him; this makes the chances of Frank being knowingly aligned with Hikari drop pretty dramatically since I don't think that the entirety of his content would be townreading his scumpartner for absolutely no reason (weak scum generally avoid scumpartners, and if Frank is this bad at faking content, I'd imagine the main read that he'd have would be a truth read as opposed to faking it and it's much easier to townread town than it is to do anything else).<br>\n<br>\nHis vote on Creep, however, is the scummiest. The entirety of the case on him presented is \"10-15, Creeps looks scummy\" to voting him instantly; this looks like scum trying to drive through the mislynch through and through.<br>\n<br>\nIf Frank is scum with havingfitz (he very likely is), then Hiraki moves up to decent town, Creeps moves up to strong town.", "time": "Sat Dec 10, 2016 10:45 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=69244&start=1125", "forum": "53", "thread": "69244"}

I think that he was attempting to push through easy mislynches, which is a feeling that is especially compounded if Frank flips scum.<br>\n<br>\n2) I think that the readswitch from scumreading TwoFace and Eric to townreading them within the course of a minute looked remarkably odd; don't think that it was a genuine thought progression.<br>\n<br>\n3) I don't like his interaction with havingfitz. He said that he would \"read all his posts within 12 hours to get a read on him\" lurked for two days, then added him to the suspect list because TwoFace (the person he was scumreading before) said so. When talking about who he was willing to wagon, the people who he is willing to lynch are Hiraki and Creeps and Fitz but he'd rather lynch Hiraki and Creeps over Fitz; this seems especially odd since his top three suspects (in order) before were 1) Creeps, 2) Gamma, and 3) fitz, so you'd think that even if he was townreading Gamma all of a sudden fitz would still be a stronger read than Hikari.<br>\n<br>\nI'll break down why some of Deer's specific posts bother me in a little bit.", "time": "Sat Dec 10, 2016 10:47 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=69244&start=1150", "forum": "53", "thread": "69244"}

Mobile so no fancy linking but earlier itg in response to nacho I explained why I was scumreading vedith. I left it because nobody else pushed the read at the time, and day 1 I said I was willing to lynch out of the 4 people and one did get a couple voted so I joined and they flipped scum. Vedith wasn't really town read for me ever, I misworded that. I believed that frank and you were the scum so PoE wise vedith would be town. However, Frank is no longer likely scum, so that slot opens right up. Twiszted is the biggest source - vedith is mostly null or slight scum lean, but twiszted looked really scummy (I explained why earlier) and the combination reinforces scum vedith. I was never not willing to lynch vedith, but I'm new and the more experienced townies getting on board with scum vedith reinforces my reads. I don't remember 1161  to 1221 specifically by numbers and I'm on mobile so checking is a pain in the ass. Scum deers and creeps were never as scummy as vedith, I still think io's RVS posts are disgustingly scummy but I was told not to read into it as early as it was so I dropped that, and creeps I've reconsidered.<br>\n<br>\n A lot of this also comes from trusting nachos hard town read on aristo when I don't see it so I'd like nacho to say if he still believes it and give a better explanation.", "time": "Wed Dec 14, 2016 5:38 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=69244&start=1375", "forum": "53", "thread": "69244"}

You never even stated you scum read me, never mind voted me. You actually haven't posted a read on me since like mid d1... or replied to my scum reads on you at all until aj mentioned me as his (only so far) scum read. <br>\n<br>\nIf you want me to talk personally, I'm not a newbie, I just play on sites with communities that respect me. A personal flaw I have is that I can't take criticism from people I consider worse than me and I skipped the part of acquiring respect on ms and as a result I've met several people on here that I can't stand and basically killed myself in this community so I'm leaving when my games are done. That's fine. The meta here is very different anyways.  I take criticism 100% and adapt my game based on how my last one goes. So, if you were to flip town, I'd look at you again as someone I scumread to see where I went wrong. Here's the thing: I can't go into more detail because ongoing but there hasn't been a single game on this site where I haven't been scum read by old players. I appear as a helpless whiny newbie which makes scummy old people think I'm an easy push or think whiteknighting me locks in an easy vote as scum. It didn't work out in 1850 (gamma was in it) where I was the earliest to read scum, and that's the only game that I can directly reference. I do good when I play with people who know how to read people who play in a different meta. It's very different from reading your own site. That mostly happened so far this game so I doubt I'll get mislynched at this stage but who knows. It's a personal flaw that I refuse to act like a newbie and I'm definitely not perfect. But anyways, tangent point being that you're scum and I'm not the easy newbie mislynch you want. New to ms =/= new to the concept of mafia.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nI explained why vedith was scum to nacho a long time ago, look in my iso. He said it was fair.

Not enough for anyone to question it but there's certainly uncertainty that Gamma is town-reading Eric. In fact, if anything, there's a clear slideline provision there.

The fact this is toward TwoFace before the vote and then he votes TwoFace after listing multiple scumreads - especially with TwoFace arguably being the weakest of the bunch - is very weird.

Fitz came down pretty hard against Gamma for this, which I thought was indicative of scum pushing town for bad logic.

I also hate PR stuff - that's something I'm sure is consistent. I would love to play vanilla mafia all day long rather than mafia with PRs but I'm getting a bit off topic. I really found what Gamma was and wasn't saying was more of an indication to look at him.

Context: Fitz has started his wall posts by this post, and I think the four-call scum post (with the bad line endings that made it look like a poem) had already come through. There's reason to vote him. To this point, Ari addresses Fitz on a vote for Io(deer)(my) slot's vote on an inactive, voting for Fitz in RVS. Once more later basically on sarcasm which was basically NAI all around. Anyways, there's reason for a Fitz lynch. <br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8548519#p8548519\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8548519#p8548519\" data-post-id=\"8548519\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 435</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=28404\">Gamma Emerald</a> wrote:</cite>I'm dead serious: if we end up not having a decent lynch at deadline I suggest we PL Creeps because his play will get in the way of the town.</div></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8548610#p8548610\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8548610#p8548610\" data-post-id=\"8548610\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 437</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=25129\">Aristophanes</a> wrote:</cite>I'd be down <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\"></div></blockquote>\n\nExchange goes together. Gamma advocates the PL on Creeps, Ari shows interest and in fact subsequently votes for creeps on the admitted PL. Both bad by Gamma and Creeps. Major issue is there's two posts between this and his fitz vote. First, one complaining about Creeps posting a huge wall for nothing more than a line response. The second correcting a grammatical mistake in his post brought up by another player. <br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8553672#p8553672\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8553672#p8553672\" data-post-id=\"8553672\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 482</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=25129\">Aristophanes</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8553620#p8553620\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8553620#p8553620\" data-post-id=\"8553620\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 480</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=28642\">Creeps20</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8553604#p8553604\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8553604#p8553604\" data-post-id=\"8553604\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 479</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=28506\">TwoFace</a> wrote:</cite>Nah it's been inactive for a while.</div></blockquote>\nHas it?

Can't remember why he scum reads Fitz but knows Creeps is bad, who he moved initially onto a policy lynch. Nothing in Creep's iso is town, but no reference of a specific point. The only saving grace is he thinks Eric is scum. Before you start this shit of \"oh but he's VI/Conf town\", foot in mouth and continue reading. <br>\n<br>\nEric's actions actually are consistent with Creeps' own actions this game. Specifically the segment about how Creeps doesn't use an avatar. It's a completely stupid notion and a newb move. Who are you actually trying to get to skip your post? Yet it was blown up to be anti-town in THIS INSTANCE where it's a site wide philosophy held by creeps (as instanced by the fact that you can't change avatars for specific threads). In the fact that he's reading his self-admitted PL and Eric the same way, there is consistency here. <br>\n<br>\nThe concerning part that remains is that \"Nothing town\" doesn't mean \"scum\" and as short as that bridge is between the two, Ari does nothing to build it. There's no conviction to this wagon that is now entering a range that was about to guarantee creeps' lynch.<br>\n<br>\n And really, looking back we can almost assume that Creep's wagon was a COUNTERWAGON to Fitz, a scum lynch. The one who perpetuates the force of this counterwagon is actually Ari, who basically swung the top two wagons by switching from a scum read to a Gamma-admitted (and not Ari-argued) PL. <br>\n<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8597072#p8597072\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8597072#p8597072\" data-post-id=\"8597072\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 1107</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=25129\">Aristophanes</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8597052#p8597052\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8597052#p8597052\" data-post-id=\"8597052\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 1104</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=28506\">TwoFace</a> wrote:</cite>but you make the most sense as the scum partner, I called that shit ages ago<br>\n<br>\nfitz/tvd (you)/hiraki</div></blockquote>\n&gt; Calls Fitz Scum<br>\n&gt; Refuses to lynch Fitz<br>\n&gt;&gt; Refuses to lynch Scum.<br>\n<br>\nGuys, TwoFace is scum :O</div></blockquote>\n\nThis was weird, because it came AFTER fitz was lynched, but before the flip.

Interestingly, both Vedith and Aristophanes were on the scum lynch and not the town lynch, though us town did a great job of lynching town without scum influence (unless scum is twoface). Twoface and Sonia were on the town lynch and not the scum lynch but TwoFace was a big pusher of the scum lynch in the first place and the primary reason fitz was lynched at all so idk and Sonia didn't push the town lynch, just begrudgingly hammered. Aj was on neither lynch.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nMy current reads on everyone not green/red above:<br>\nTwoFace<br>\n<br>\nSonia<br>\nGamma<br>\n<br>\nAristophanes <br>\n<br>\nAj<br>\nVedith<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nRereading day 1 and having the knowledge Hiraki was town TwoFace looked worse to me than the lock town I thought he was, but yall said nobody would SvS interact like that so I'll leave him. Sonia was the counterwagon and was good yesterday, defending Hiraki and all, though refusing to read is annoying. Gamma and Fitz probably wasnt SvS but it is a possibility. Gamma was early on the wagon though. <br>\n<br>\nThen the scummier side. Aristophanes might be my number one scum read from just memory/gut: involving rereading and VCs, this read is dependant on Nacho still believing they're town too but voting with both townies and not lynching town while lynching scum is good. Aj and Vedith are PoE but I've sr'd Vedith for a really really long time, and Aj's entrance was all around bad. <br>\n<br>\nHOWEVER: there is the clear issue that Hiraki thought Aj and Vedith were town. I wish he had fucking towncased Vedith but whatever. I tend to analyze dead townies reads and put a lot of stock into reads of players that are experienced, so him townreading both of them is giving me doubts. I am probably wrong somewhere and have to do some more thinking. Ngl so glad Frank was the death because I did not trust him to be bg at all and I was gonna keep questioning him. He was probably the 'ideal' nightkill for my reads if you can use ideal like that.

In particular, this is an opening that makes more sense as a VT WIFOMing than a PR WIFOMing; VTs would be doing it to increase the chance of them being night killed, PR would do it in order to decrease the chances of them being night killed because they'd hope scum would assume the first scenario.

And, also realize that this Fitz scumread held for the entirety of the day; it ended up evolving for more than just this, but Aristo never attempted to derail the budding Fitz wagon and joined it pretty much the moment it became more viable than Creeps.

Aristo not mentioning why he thought Creeps should just be PLed shouldn't be a dig against Aristo (why would it be?), especially when his other posts in context demonstrate that his attitude towards Creeps has been \"his posts suck, let's lynch him\" more than \"I think Creeps should be policy lynched in order to protect the game!\".</div></blockquote>\n\nI disagree.

It's just bad play. Whenever I see a lynch on anti-town, it can always be called into question if it's actually just a PL. We consider lurking anti-town, for example. <br>\n<br>\nI get what Nacho said (at the time) with the claim, in the fact that it was drawing near for the day to end. However the best reaction would've been to have worked for encouraging activity early on, declaring the options real quick and pushing hard for the lynch, not asking for a L-2 claim. No one's going to let a game go to a NL night 1, or there's enough town around to prevent it. <br>\n<br>\nI think the vote switch is more telling that we've been giving it credit. It's not like Gamma does a lot with that wagon outside cheerleading Creeps into existence, and the vote change back on looks opportunistic as hell. <br>\n<br>\nYour original statement just made it seem like I had done nothing the entire time I've been here. That's not really true, even though the time I've been here is rather limited thus far. I've made two cases, which is more than I can say for a lot of people here.

Long and short, Fitz starts to become default wagon, hiraki/Creeps sure secondary wagons.

Wagons start on Nacho's scumreads (deer/my slot, Vedith? and Hiraki). The wagon's pretty easy, is ran up high pretty easy with only real reason day isn't ended earlier is more replacements. I replace in right about now. Call Hiraki town, Josh slot scum off of some of Eric's early posts and what I had seen. Starts some pressure on me. Case made on Ari, Nacho claims Ari town off meta, would explain later. Hiraki eventually dies, claims Vedith/My slot town. Flips town. <br>\n-Frank dies to BG after we forced him to protect Nacho, saying he would die if nacho died before him. <br>\n<br>\n-D3, wagons basically as is. Nacho makes case that Ari is town based meta and refuting case, case made on Gamma. <br>\n<br>\nOverall, Uzi/Nacho are conftown. Josh is probs town. Nacho is completely convinced Ari is town.

In addition the post I was replying to clearly implied - in a rigorous logical way - that you were not scum reading my slot immediately before my calling you a scum read. However, regardless of that \"back to red\" bit, I was asking a question and had not finished reading the thread - 1980 begins with me saying that I had got to Two's second vote on Having - and thus calling it a lie of any sort is obviously garbage.<br>\n<br>\nAsking a question about why we're continuing discussing it while pretending like we should cease discussion is obviously disingenuous.

He checks in, states he'll get to rereading, and then immediately asks AJ for a brief summary of the thread. This is off because AJ hadn't posted anything game related in a while at the time of this question and he was also the leading wagon. You haven't read the thread and you're asking the leading wagon for a summary when you have no idea of what your thoughts are on his alignment. Why would town do this? You just subbed in and you haven't read anything and you want a summary of the game from someone you don't know if you can trust yet. Just doesn't add up. <br>\n<br>\nIn <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8661250#p8661250\">1956</a>, he gives out a read list while stating he still has not read the thread. What was the point of this? Why would town give a reads list if they have not read the thread? What's even more telling is that he's obviously lying about not having read the thread based on his read on Josh. There is no way one can have that strong of a SR on Josh if they've claimed to have not read the thread. What are you hiding from scum from lying about not having read?<br>\n<br>\nThen we have his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8661295#p8661295\">1960</a> and we see where the confusion has sort of stemmed from and why VCA can never be the basis of an entire case in his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8661299#p8661299\">1961</a>. VCA lacks context and it does not always tell the whole story. <br>\n<br>\nIn <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8661295#p8661295\">1960</a>, he says he's only looked at the vote counts and that's how he got his SR on TF. That's fine. What's not fine is that he had no intention of going back and understanding how the Fitz wagon formed based on his latter comment in his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8661401#p8661401\">1965</a> and you could argue his first point in that same post was the beginning stages of him discreditng the work TF put in by calling his policy awful. What also doesn't make it fine is when he decides to argue semantics in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8661469#p8661469\">1975</a>. Maybe policy isn't the best choice of words but it's clear that TF means a general belief and he showed examples of him following that belief in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8661416#p8661416\">1967</a>. The issue should've been dropped right then and there.<br>\n<br>\nIn <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8661569#p8661569\">1983</a>, he claimed he finished reading Day 1 and that Gamma is the reason why Fitz was lynched. This is bull and anyone who was actually here Day 1 can tell you that's not how it went down but even if you weren't, a through reread what have told you that wagon was all TF. He also says this clears Gamma which isn't true and why does Gamma barely providing any reasons of his own and being on the wagon clears him but TF being the driving force of the wagon but hopping off because a belief he proves he actually has doesn't? This thinking doesn't sound like it's coming from town.<br>\n<br>\nFast forward to his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8664538#p8664538\">2038</a>, he says TF has been basically flip-flopping. This is another example of King having not read throughly and missing something called context. The lynch was inevitable because Day 1 exceeded way past the two week limit due to the amount of replacements and the extensions we were given. That takes a wear on players especially after so much had been discussed. In his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8664662#p8664662\">2051</a>, he argues that lynching is something one doesn't do by themselves and plays the semantics game. If so, why give credit to Gamma for the lynch and then latter Nacho? And again, it's clear what TF means by lynching here. He is obviously saying he doesn't help lynch claimed PRs.<br>\n<br>\nHere, in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8664778#p8664778\">2058</a>, is another example of where the argument should've been dropped. King brings up again that TF is trying to get town credit for lynching Fitz. Why would scum who dropped off the way King has been arguing TF did constantly bring up he was the driving force of the Fitz wagon? Makes no sense. <br>\n<br>\nIn <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8665532#p8665532\">2108</a>, another attempt to discredit TF after he presented the argument he had for Fitz being scum in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8664729#p8664729\">2055</a> and another sign King hasn't read throughly. The reason the wagon stalled on Fitz was because we had competing wagons on Creeps and Hiraki and various people on those wagons were stubborn, including me!<br>\n<br>\n--<br>\n<br>\ntl:dr: King is scum because he has proven that he's unwilling to make the effort to read the thread throughly and understand context as well continue to argue semantics</div></div></div>", "time": "Tue Dec 27, 2016 6:30 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=69244&start=2175", "forum": "53", "thread": "69244"}

If me and Nacho weren't masons and you had asked him that same question, I wouldn't have given it a second thought because you at least showed that you knew him prior to this game and for all I know that's enough of a reason you may have to trust his summary of the game for the time being.<br>\n<br>\nGiving reads isn't exactly pro-town and it definitely isn't when 3 of those reads you got were from Nacho. You didn't say you skimmed or you read just ISOs, you had claimed to have not read the game. There is no way you could have that read on Josh with that claim which is why I called you a liar. Your case on Josh still doesn't make him scum. Active lurking is NAI. Also, why does it sound like you're trying to get town credit for giving reads yet you criticized TF for claiming he was trying to get town credit for saying the wagon on Fitz was all him? <br>\n<br>\nI don't trust you because I think you're scum and I was actually there.

Scum want to live just as much as town do. Of course some sort of fake claim was going to be thrown out.<br>\n<br>\nCompeting wagons stopped Fitz from being lynched quickly because people essentially wanted to policy lynch Creeps and also wanted to lynch Hiraki because his play didn't read like it was coming from town and was screaming scum. It looked like Nacho was the one that got Fitz lynched because he subbed in very late into a day which had taken such a toll on the town.

Did I somehow unread the thread in my intervening posts.<br>\n<br>\nEveryone: Please just reread the creation of the final Having wagon. The fact that Having was lynched Day One was not down to Two. Just read the pages in question, it's not ambiguous. Two's most recent comment on Having before Nacho's interrogation is explicitly giving up on Having been lynched Day One.

We gave in and we lucked out.</div></blockquote>\n\nThe competing wagons were stil there when nacho subbed in. The existance of competing wagons does not explain where it took 20 pages after he made it for Two's arguments to magically create the successful wagon.\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>\nI am calling you scum because you have shown you're not willing to reread the game throughly.

If Gamma had not followed - something he very easily could have avoided - then Having would not have been lynched. Two, on the other hand, had no such freely-made keystone choice.

Did those competing wagons simply vanish? No. The competing wagons is obviously not a valid reason for saying why the wagon stalled with Two and went smoothly with Nacho.<br>\n<br>\nLuv: in your second paragraph you are calling me a liar and saying I had read the thread. But then later posts are saying that I'm scum for not reading the thread. Did I somehow unread the thread in my intervening posts.<br>\n<br>\nEveryone: Please just reread the creation of the final Having wagon. The fact that Having was lynched Day One was not down to Two. Just read the pages in question, it's not ambiguous. Two's most recent comment on Having before Nacho's interrogation is explicitly giving up on Having been lynched Day One. Nacho - and accidentally Gamma - are responsible for Having being lynched. I'm not saying trust<br>\n me over your memories. I'm saying reread the pages in question. It's not ambiguous.<br>\n<br>\nIf that requires my flip first then that's fine. But once it's proven that I am town, could people just read the relevant pages. Please.</div></blockquote>\n\nIt's off when you just subbed in and gave no indication in your opening post of having played with him prior like you did with Nacho. If me and Nacho weren't masons and you had asked him that same question, I wouldn't have given it a second thought because you at least showed that you knew him prior to this game and for all I know that's enough of a reason you may have to trust his summary of the game for the time being.</div></blockquote>\n\nI did not interact with him to sheep him. I interacted to try to get a read on him since he was the biggest wagon. Is that honestly a concept you are unfamiliar with?<br>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>\nGiving reads isn't exactly pro-town and it definitely isn't when 3 of those reads you got were from Nacho. You didn't say you skimmed or you read just ISOs, you had claimed to have not read the game. There is no way you could have that read on Josh with that claim which is why I called you a liar.<br>\n\n</div></blockquote>\nI also made several references to Nacho's reads. Do you genuinely think i was trying to give the impression that i had read nothing related to the game? I had not read the game at that point just the mod's and Nacho's posts. If you'rte coming me scum for \"arguing semantics\" then how do you explain the beam in a mason's eye? surely that would be the definition of NAI if a mason like yourself is relying on it.\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>\n Your case on Josh still doesn't make him scum.</div></blockquote>\nAnd whatever case was made on your slot didn't make you scum. and whatever case was made against hiraki doesn't make him scum. This is garbage reasoning for thinking somebody is scummy.\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div> Active lurking is NAI. Also, why does it sound like you're trying to get town credit for giving reads yet you criticized TF for claiming he was trying to get town credit for saying the wagon on Fitz was all him? \n</div></blockquote>\nI'm not trying to get towncred. I'm saying that calling providing content scummy is risible - particularly when you're calling active lurking null.\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>\nI don't trust you because I think you're scum and I was actually there. The reason people came around to Fitz were mostly for the reasons TF laid out.<br>\n<br>\nTF's <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8667211#p8667211\">2189</a> addresses this point fairly well.\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>\nYou do not have to trust me. I am not asking you to trust me. Take ten minutes to read the relevant part of the thread.<br>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>\nAll the answers he's given to that question are pretty much the same thing, you just keep arguing semantics. <br>\n<br>\nThis is dumb. Scum want to live just as much as town do. Of course some sort of fake claim was going to be thrown out.</div></blockquote>\nIf he was fakeclaiming to increase his chances of stying alive, then his odds of staying alive after the lynch was - to the scum's perspective - not inevitable.\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>\n<br>\nCompeting wagons stopped Fitz from being lynched quickly because people essentially wanted to policy lynch Creeps and also wanted to lynch Hiraki because his play didn't read like it was coming from town and was screaming scum. It looked like Nacho was the one that got Fitz lynched because he subbed in very late into a day which had taken such a toll on the town. We gave in and we lucked out.</div></blockquote>\n\nThe competing wagons were stil there when nacho subbed in. The existance of competing wagons does not explain where it took 20 pages after he made it for Two's arguments to magically create the successful wagon.\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>\nI am calling you scum because you have shown you're not willing to reread the game throughly. If you were willing, we would probably not be having this discussion right now.</div></blockquote></div></blockquote></div></blockquote>\nDon't be a hypocrite. I've read the game thoroughly. If you thought that I hadn't, then you'd be willing to read the handful of pages relevant to this discussion. If you're actively avoiding looking at readily available evidence then that's not because you think the evidence will confirm your suspicions.<br>\n<br>\nIf Nacho had not voted Having at the end then Having would not have been lyynched day One. If Gamma had not followed - something he very easily could have avoided - then Having would not have been lynched. Two, on the other hand, had no such freely-made keystone choice. You don't have to trust me on that. You can read the thread. The primary source is right here. Its easy! If you're reading this sentence then you're most the way there.<br>\n<br>\nP-Edit: I said policy in 1965. You continued the use in 1966. You gave examples in 1967. Regardless has there ever been a more semantics argument that \"I never used the exact word\"? <br>\n<br>\nThat's a lie. I am not the one bringing it up. That's Luv (and I think) you.</div></blockquote>\n\nOh I understand the concept, it just doesn't make sense to me when you claimed you haven't read. I honestly think town would be more interested finding out for themselves why the wagon formed and who is/was reluctant to join it.<br>\n<br>\nIt didn't sound like you were joking when you said you hadn't read at all and if you only read the posts from the mod and Nacho, why wouldn't you just state that? Even then, how did Nacho's posts give you that read on Josh at that point? <br>\n<br>\nI'm not saying and have never said you're scum for calling someone an active lurker.

If Empking was scum not with AJ, his highest priority would be driving through the AJ mislynch. If Empking was scum with AJ, his highest priority is getting cred for his partner's lynch and preparing to go the distance.

The two reads Empking has pushed since he's came are Joshz and TwoFace; after the masons, these are the two most universally townread players in the game. I suppose it's possible that Empking as scum set out to manipulate just me for a day (not likely, that's a dumb as hell strategy for the reason you're all seeing before you now), but he's a savvy enough player as scum where he realizes that this path of attack isn't getting him anywhere. The only thing that makes sense from Empking as scum here is him attempting to suicide, which he'd have no reason to do regardless of who his partner is (partner gets better cred if he looks townier as he goes down), and the only person he could be attempting to save for a day here is AJ, which doesn't make sense because AJ really shouldn't make it to endgame at this point.", "time": "Wed Dec 28, 2016 2:39 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=69244&start=2225", "forum": "53", "thread": "69244"}

If you were in a room with 3 Nazis and had 4 bullets in your gun, and they wanted to kill you, would you waste a shot shooting the air leaving you no chance to miss with the other three or would you shoot the Nazis and keep the 4th bullet in the chamber in case one dodged it somehow? <br>\nObviously a ridiculous, exaggerated scenario, but \"lynch the goddamned scum\" is the moral here.<br>\n<br>\n2.

Gamma was not the fish to be fried the previous day phase, fitz's push on him should have made him more clear than others imo. you voting emp and then hopping off for bad reasoning doesn't earn you town points. <br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8711640#p8711640\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=8711640#p8711640\" data-post-id=\"8711640\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 2578</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=28112\">xSoniaNevermindx</a> wrote:</cite>sigh is that really the best you had?<br>\nThat was slightly boring and a bit tedious I was expecting more of a challenge.</div></blockquote>\nthis is a bad post because like I said, your response to hap's posts weren't very good. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\nRight now scum is in you or hap. i can't figure out which one I think is scummier.<br>\n<br>\nhard pushing against the person that was an earlier strong scum read and them flipping scum<br>\n<br>\nor <br>\n<br>\ndoing nothing at all with regards to lynching scum<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nI don't think Ari is scum because he joined emp when he could have easily joined gamma<br>\n<br>\ngamma got pushed by fitz after he joined the creeps wagon. so I don't think gamma is scum and kind of leans me towards creeps being scum.<br>\n<br>\nlooking at the wagon when creeps was L-1, I think every single person on that wagon was town with the exception of 2 alive and both of those 2 look pretty townie compared to the other 2.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nCreeps20 (6): <div style=\"display:inline;color:#0000FF\">ScumDeersAreVeryTasty (AJ), Hiraki</div>, Aristophanes, <div style=\"display:inline;color:#0000FF\">MathBlade, FrankJaeger</div>, Gamma Emerald", "time": "Wed Jan 11, 2017 7:06 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=69244&start=2600", "forum": "53", "thread": "69244"}

I could try to look through Josh's filter and defend our slot, but I think that just isn't a credible line of argument.<br>\n<br>\nIn my own defense, I'll make three points:<br>\n1) Josh's D4 looks bad.  However, what else in his filter looks bad?  If you look at Josh's whole filter, I think you'll see someone that is town, but made some pretty poor decisions on D4.  Bad Play =/= Mafia.  Inconsistent Play =/= Mafia.  <br>\n2) Sonia by contrast, has been consistently suspicious since she replaced in.  I would recommend looking at her actions in the lynch on D2, where she waffles about and doesn't seem to care much about who gets lynched between two townies.  On D3, she half-heartedly pushes EMP while looking for any excuse to direct the lynch elsewhere.  I've talked about D4 in great detail.  As you talked about above, her D5 hasn't been pretty.   <br>\n3) Compare my contributions today to what Sonia is doing. I'm active, I'm contributing, and I'm doing my best to remain objective.  Compare this to Sonia's defense... she is basically saying that being more useful to town is boring, and that she will not change her playstyle. <br>\n<br>\nI'll be around to answer questions.
