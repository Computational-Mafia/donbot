{"forum": "53", "thread": "69244", "pagelink": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=69244&start=0", "number": "1", "timestamp": "Fri Nov 18, 2016 2:18 pm", "user": "Dierfire", "content": "<div style=\"text-align: center\">RULES</div><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">General</span></span><br>01. Site rules may be found <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=6470\" class=\"postlink\">here</a> for reference. Note that playing to win condition is a requirement.<br>02. The rules are subject to change at my discretion to correct any errors or omissions. Should any changes be implemented, they will be announced in the same format as the original rule (for example, changes to the main set of rules will be announced in the main thread; changes to role-specific rules will be sent by PM).<br>03. Pretending to violate any of these rules will be treated the same as an actual violation.<br>04. Everyone is here to have fun, and I hope that we will all keep this in mind throughout the game. Please contact me directly (by PM) with any problems or questions. In the event that I make an error, please call it to my attention by PM or by addressing me in the relevant thread (<span class=\"noboldsig\">I will look for \u201c@Mod\u201d</span>).<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Posting</span></span><br>05. Players should use English exclusively, without any form of hidden or encoded text.<br>06. Once I have declared a player to be dead, that player should not post in the main thread until I have declared the game to be over.<br>07. Players should not provide direct quotations from, images of, or other provable references to any game-related PM or PT.<br>08. Players should not use any form of provable randomness for any reason.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Timing</span></span><br>09. Each Day Phase will last 240 hours. Each Night Phase will last 48 hours. Deadlines may be extended at my discretion as necessary to ensure that the game continues smoothly. Any such extension will be announced in the main thread.<br>10. Players who have not posted in 48 consecutive hours will receive a prod. After receiving a prod, a player has 24 hours to post before I will begin seeking a replacement. Players on V/LA will be exempt from these prod requirements; however, if a player requires an extensive period of V/LA, I may determine that the game would be better served by a replacement and replace that player at my discretion.<br>11. Players who do not make sufficient attempt to participate (including--but not limited to--players who require repeated prods) may be replaced at my discretion.<br>12. If a player being replaced for inactivity should return to the game before a replacement is found, that player may be allowed to continue in the game at my discretion. However, once a player has been replaced, that player may not continue in the game.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Day Phase</span></span><br>13. Players may vote to lynch another player using either vote tags or bold tags as demonstrated below.<br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Name</span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: Name</span><br>In order to be counted, votes should appear on a separate line and not within spoiler tags or otherwise concealed. Votes not following this format may be counted if I believe that a vote was intended.<br>14. When one player has achieved a majority of votes (more living players voting for that player than living players not voting for that player), that player will be lynched and the phase will end. If the deadline is reached before a lynch is achieved, no player will be lynched.<br>15. Players may vote to end the phase without a lynch. An example of such a vote is given below:<br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: No Lynch</span><br>If the number of living players voting for this option is greater than or equal to the number of living players not voting for this option, the phase will end without a lynch and the game will proceed directly to Night Phase.<br>16. Players may continue to post in the main thread until I have announced the end of the phase, regardless of whether or not a lynch has occurred.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Game Design</span></span><br>17. In addition to the site-wide rules, it may be useful to review the <a href=\"http://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Normal_Game\" class=\"postlink\">Normal Game guidelines</a> and the <a href=\"http://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Natural_Action_Resolution/Normal_Game\" class=\"postlink\">Natural Action Resolution guidelines</a>.<br>18. Any PT associated with this game will be open for use at all times (Day Phase and Night Phase). <span class=\"noboldsig\">Every PT related to this game will be made public after the game is over, although I will redact posts by player request.</span><br>19. No player may perform more than one action during a single Night Phase.<br>20. At least one player will receive the following role:<br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div> Welcome, (player), to Mini Normal 1854!<br><br>Your role is Citizen, aligned with <span style=\"color: green\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Town</span></span>.<br><br>Abilities: You have no special abilities.<br><br>Victory: You win if all living players are aligned with Town.</div></blockquote>"}

Looks like going after an easy target which I feel is more likely to come from town. Some of Eric's posts aren't great but nothing looks like they have scummy intentions.

With regard to that interpretation...I do not agree with that mindset.  1) Vis and newbies can be scum just as easily as anyone and 2) Several years of mafia experience (albeit not on this site) =/= newbie and the things you are basing your VI read on him for iirc are things that can simply be attributed to being unfamiliar with some aspects of this website.  The things he says and does are still fair game for assessing his alignment.  I'm not and haven't been willing to just discard him for being new to this site.  And your <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8540933#p8540933\">Post 331</a> seems to hint at you at least being open to considering that Eric could be scum.

And going on and on about it serves absolutely no value and just gives the impression of trying.

Throughout your debate with Ted he states he was referring to two scumreads in particular.  Not all of Eric's reads as you attack him for.<br><br>- I'm not saying your naked vote on Misa is bad...I'm saying you voting a mason is bad.  Which I can say in my post with the hindsight now that you were voting town.  If I didn't assume LUV and Misa were telling the truth I wouldn't have considered you vote negatively.<br><br>- Defending a town read...I just point it out for future reference.  Null atm.  Defensive much?<br><br>- I viewed your description of voting Misa as gut more than once after giving several reasons as your ways of backtracking on the vote...giving yourself a little deniability if Misa were lynched and to flip town.  A softening of your stance on her while at the same time maintaining your vote on her.<br><br>- In hindsight voting town (mason Misa) is bad...yes?  Voting town in bad...yes?  We have more information at our disposal following the mason claims so that colors your vote on Misa negatively.  Comprehend?<br><br>- Lovely.<br><br>@TwoFace wrt post 357.  Why can't I use the mason claims (until they are shown to be false) to discredit any pushes made on them?

Now, I'm thinking you are trying to get on a good side of Eric. You are scum either way. How are you so damn sure it will be a mislynch? Give me reasons how/why Eric is town.</div></blockquote><br>No I've never seen him play. <br>I disagree with you because I don't see any scum intent in his posts. That post he made that says he doesn't work with others is 100% a townie post. No way scum says that ever. It's counterproductive to what scum need to do to win. They need to blend in and deceive town. That's the opposite of that. That's town and I'd stake my life in this game on it. Anyone pushing him as scum are scum themselves or blinded by stupidity. <br>I most certainly am not scum either way, cause I'm not scum at all.

But even if it was, omgus isn't scummy. It's not omgus cause I provided multiple reasons why he was scum. I didn't just say FU for voting me so I'll vote you.

Straight OMGUSing.</div></blockquote><br>Thanks for proving you haven't read my posts. If you're town you have the responsibility to read my posts and consider them. Don't just write me off as omgusing. Cause tbh even if he didn't vote me I would have ripped him apart. <br><br>Go read the part where he's basically calling anyone who voted the masons bad, but he was scum reading one of the masons which means his basis for that assumption is bad.  Also look at the example where he as town previously led a lynch on a town PR which also means HISTORICALLY his thought process is flawed. <br><br>A person votes a scummy person who later claims a pr, doesn't make everyone guilty.

However, there is no scum motivation to do so either if the player is trying to win. There is no reason that the person can just make another alt at the end of the day. It does a give a small advantage in having someone (i.e. me) defend him if he is scum but I don't think this is the case.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Lil Uzi wrote:</cite>There is no motivation to do so as town and I believe him when he says he's been playing mafia for a couple of years on another site.

Again, not disputing the fact that HF's stuff doesn't have a hint of scum taint but I don't really believe that. He gave a slew of other reasons, valid or not. I'm not really concerned about them because, as you will see, I have my own reasons.<br><br>I would be OK with anyone saying this but anyone who has thought about voting Eric (like Gamma has done) when Eric does literally the same things from an objective viewpoint. Except, Gamma only shows intent to vote Eric but doesn't do it. There's even a flip-flop on Eric between 185 and 384. Not enough for anyone to question it but there's certainly uncertainty that Gamma is town-reading Eric. In fact, if anything, there's a clear slideline provision there. But the fact that he's going to OK Havingfitz for some of the same things that Eric has literally done puts me at an unease.<br><br>3) Ari:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8546586#p8546586\" class=\"postlink\">post 413</a>, Aristophanes wrote:</cite>I mean like \"You voted a Mason before they claimed! You must be scum!\" doesn't even make any fucking sense!</div></blockquote>You're right...and Havingfitz is experienced. Doesn't something seem very weird there?<br><br>I don't really want to do anything more with Ari because that's all he talks about Fitz in a relative sense (not a bad thing since Fitz has been V/LA)<br><br>There's nothing wrong with three people voting in the same exact way if it's for 110% valid reasons but I don't think this reason is 110% valid. There are certainly cracks and no one is following havingfitz. I think these reasons can be legitimate with the next post that he writes but not at the current moment.<br><br>Here are some reasons that fitz does draw actual concern though:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8538813#p8538813\" class=\"postlink\">post 286</a>, havingfitz wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8538770#p8538770\" class=\"postlink\">post 284</a>, TwoFace wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8538754#p8538754\" class=\"postlink\">post 283</a>, MisaTange wrote:</cite>her replacing out is NAI imo regardless of reasons</div></blockquote><br>1. I didn't ask you<br>2. I don't agree with you</div></blockquote><br>1.  We're you just thinking aloud and not looking for anyone else's opinion?  <br>2.  Who asked you?</div></blockquote>Posts like these are very uncanny and weird. The fact this is toward TwoFace before the vote and then he votes TwoFace after listing multiple scumreads - especially with TwoFace arguably being the weakest of the bunch - is very weird. There's some sort of tunnel vision that Fitz is applying and it's not great. Started with Io in the beginning to a small degree, now it's straight onto TwoFace.<br><br>I also think that the response to me in 358 says a lot about Fitz's opinions of the game rather than opinions in general. The first two statements on VIs is ignorable because there's no reason to lie in that situation. Moving on from there:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8542420#p8542420\" class=\"postlink\">post 358</a>, havingfitz wrote:</cite>The things he says and does are still fair game for assessing his alignment.  I'm not and haven't been willing to just discard him for being new to this site. </div></blockquote>This is the real meat of the situation. The fact that Fitz can't distinguish that some one, who is new, cannot have a different playstyle that would react differently to the overall alignment of a player is just straight up not true. There's no way Fitz can say that with a straight face without trying to convince himself of that fact.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8542420#p8542420\" class=\"postlink\">post 358</a>, havingfitz wrote:</cite> Prior to the mason claims and Deer replacing in, Eric was lower down on my radar and not in conflict with your adamant mindset.

It certainly seems to be that way and links back to what I said at the top. Eric is probably 3rd lynch material for Fitz.<br><br>I know how to best play from a scum perspective and Fitz does that.

Eric had ~3...  Ari had 3.   Simply casting a vote or suspicions on a mason count not = a player being scum and was never said to equal that.  Your continued focus on that one inaccurate assertion shows your case on me is baseless.<br><br>Question to you TwoFace.

I do not spend a lot of time defending people I do not 100% know are town.  And my comments on LUV aren't so much a defense of TVD as they are a criticism for a very bad post by LUV.

Are you suggesting that if I find one person scummy for  suspecting/voting the masons that I have to find everyone scummy who suspected/voted the masons?  Because that's not what I was ever doing.  And I already answered your question about me suspecting you for your naked vote on Misa.  I did not.  I mentioned you made a naked vote on a mason.  Take out the word naked if you want.  My issue was with you voting the mason (along with several other issues).  Not with it being a naked vote.  Comprehension is key.<br><br>More asap."}

I didn't realize it at the time that you left hiraki and tvd off of your reads explanation which is why I didn't catch them the first time, and when I went to look at who all was voting uzi, I noticed both hiraki (reasonless vote when he casted it) and tvd (flat out called uzi scum) and it was weird they remained your top town reads, when neither had really done anything to earn it imo.

I think that the reason that you left tvd and hiraki out makes sense if the 3 of you are scum together.

Where? - pretty sure I didn't so possible misrep here <span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: blue\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">- I viewed your <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8532255#p8532255\">Post 33</a> comments towards LUV as trying to plant seeds of suspicion (shade) on him. </span></span></span><br>I certainly didn't misrep ted. Misrep in your part <span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: blue\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">- you claimed Ted inferred Eric had to <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8534038#p8534038\">~always justify his reads</a> and that Eric <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8534038#p8534038\">\"gave no reasons\"</a> for his votes.  And didn't give reasons for \"all of his scum reads.\"  All Ted said when he voted Eric in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8533908#p8533908\">Post 142</a> was that Eric was \"throwing out reads with zero backing.\"  \"Reads\" implies more than one read....not ALL reads.  Throughout your debate with Ted he states he was referring to two scumreads in particular.  Not ALL of Eric's reads as you attack him for. IMO this was misrepping Ted to garner unwarranted suspicions on him.</span></span></span><br>Naked votes aren't bad - you should know better than that <span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: blue\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">- I never said naked votes were bad.  My comment was to indicate voting a mason was bad.</span></span></span><br>Defending a town read one who's most likely lynch bait - protown.  <span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: blue\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">- I didn't say this was bad.  I simply placed it there to look back on later if and when yours or Eric's alignments were known.</span></span></span><br>Vote on gut but gave reasons is somehow bad? No because gut is usually able to be explained by pointing to things. If you were a newb I could see you making this mistake but you aren't a newb <span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: blue\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">- you didn't vote on gut.  You gave several reasons for your vote.

With the current knowledge that exists...that you were voting town...I can say in hindsight that vote was bad.  Essentially VCA.  You want to dismiss it because I'm using it against you in combination with other suspicions.  Not on it's own...in combination with other suspicions.</span></span></span><br><strike>Snarkiness - this is non ai, especially since it's my personality</strike><br>So fitz is probably scum.

And as far as AI...whether you the accused agree or not...in my opinion there are things AI.

You are misrepping me to Deers and anyone else paying attention.   In hindsight all of the votes on masons were bad because voting town is bad.  I do not however ever say anyone who voted the masons is scum and I do not suspect anyone of being scum solely on the basis of the fact they voted a mason.  It's just one factor to consider.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8543600#p8543600\" class=\"postlink\">post 377</a>, TwoFace wrote:</cite>A person votes a scummy person who later claims a pr, doesn't make everyone guilty. <span class=\"noboldsig\">That's how he's treating everyone though.</span></div></blockquote><br>This is a blatant lie.

Also defending Eric as adamently as he did.  While I did disagree with him on this...unless the were scum partners (Hiraki and Eric) I do not see a scum Hiraki going to the trouble he went to to defend Eric as a VI.  Which I in fact questioned him on.  <br><br>That's about it.  Since my Post 349 TVD had provided no content before his recent replacement and I was too engaged with TF to notice anything Hiraki was doing.  <br><br>But at least up to Post 349 I am still good with how I stood on them both."}

Applying the suspicion equally to everyone would cancel it out.  As explained several times but outside of your comprehension level or best interests...the voting on masons was only a factor I considered amongst several for each of my scum reads.  Everyone that suspected or voted the masons is not scum...but that doesn't mean it was a pro-town thing to do.

I already made this point earlier, your excluding them from your suspicion list based off \"gut\" reads from way back on page 8, really only makes sense if you were all masons together, and since you obviously aren't I don't see how you can protect 2 people who basically did what others did.<br><br>use the attacking masons equally or don't use it at all. clearly you aren't using it equally and that is suspicious to me. <br><br>It's also suspicious that you are even using that as a scumtell when it is non ai, but I have already explained that also."}

Now, typically, meta'ing after a single game is foolish and silly, but there's a big enough difference between the two games where it's definitely something I think we should talk about. There's also the matter of Frank's lack of time in this game is probably genuine which eats into the significance of this a bit but even when he's had a bit of time he's reached nothing close to the production he reached in that game and I think it's because he's uncomfortable with playing scum.<br><br>As far as body of work goes, Frank seems a hell of a lot more invested in 1744 than he does here, even from the beginning; whereas our Frank focuses on what's anti-town and throws out reads without backing them up at all, 1744 Frank questions early, and when he provides a scumread, provides decent backing to go along with it. Also of note is that during this game Frank goes through a hurricane that takes away computer access and when he comes back he has a catchup that is a great deal less underwhelming than the catchup we got here (compare <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8430409#p8430409\" class=\"postlink\">this</a> and <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8430917#p8430917\" class=\"postlink\">this</a> with the atrociousness that we were subjected to).<br><br>Now, as for game related posts... <br><br>First of all, he has 30 posts this game. 10 of them are promises of more content. Now, that people don't have time and all, but the fact that dodging posting in the game is a third of his posting is the part where prod dodging veers from annoying into alignment-indicative; compounded with the fact that whenever he does post content it's violently underwhelming, I don't really think there's a chance that he's town here.<br><br>Another good chunk of his posts are posts that aren't promises, but posts that aren't alignment-indicative; <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8532535#p8532535\" class=\"postlink\">58</a> and <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8532546#p8532546\" class=\"postlink\">60</a> are two posts dealing with why he thinks something is anti-town and thus has nothing to do with alignment, <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8532557#p8532557\" class=\"postlink\">61</a> is discussing alt identity and thus has nothing to do with alignment, <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8532701#p8532701\" class=\"postlink\">67</a> is talking about how discussing TVD's alt-identity is antitown and thus has nothing to do with alignment, <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8532805#p8532805\" class=\"postlink\">82</a> and <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8532858#p8532858\" class=\"postlink\">86</a> are two Frank posts where he talks about why discussing whether TVD is an alt or not is useless and thus has nothing to do with alignment.<br><br>The rest of his posts are half-baked reads; he townreads Hikari because \"a couple posts look townish\" and spend a large part of his time talking about how he doesn't see how people are scumreading him; this makes the chances of Frank being knowingly aligned with Hikari drop pretty dramatically since I don't think that the entirety of his content would be townreading his scumpartner for absolutely no reason (weak scum generally avoid scumpartners, and if Frank is this bad at faking content, I'd imagine the main read that he'd have would be a truth read as opposed to faking it and it's much easier to townread town than it is to do anything else).<br><br>His vote on Creep, however, is the scummiest. The entirety of the case on him presented is \"10-15, Creeps looks scummy\" to voting him instantly; this looks like scum trying to drive through the mislynch through and through.<br><br>If Frank is scum with havingfitz (he very likely is), then Hiraki moves up to decent town, Creeps moves up to strong town."}

I mean sure, I guess that she could be scum and backtracking because she got too much heat for the push, but seems unlikely to me. <br><br>From a body of work perspective, the main reasons that I suspect Deer are:<br><br>1) I think that most of his pushes (primarily on Eric and Creeps) have been remarkably easy pushes to make without any conviction. I think that he was attempting to push through easy mislynches, which is a feeling that is especially compounded if Frank flips scum.<br><br>2) I think that the readswitch from scumreading TwoFace and Eric to townreading them within the course of a minute looked remarkably odd; don't think that it was a genuine thought progression.<br><br>3) I don't like his interaction with havingfitz. He said that he would \"read all his posts within 12 hours to get a read on him\" lurked for two days, then added him to the suspect list because TwoFace (the person he was scumreading before) said so. When talking about who he was willing to wagon, the people who he is willing to lynch are Hiraki and Creeps and Fitz but he'd rather lynch Hiraki and Creeps over Fitz; this seems especially odd since his top three suspects (in order) before were 1) Creeps, 2) Gamma, and 3) fitz, so you'd think that even if he was townreading Gamma all of a sudden fitz would still be a stronger read than Hikari.<br><br>I'll break down why some of Deer's specific posts bother me in a little bit."}

The only one who knows you are town is you, so in a public VCA, you should be assumed unknown. Making yourself the same colour as the masons is a bold statement, and coupled with your adding yourself to Futz's wagon \"In spirit\" despite not being there really makes me think you're trying too hard to convince yourself you are town so you may appear that way. <br><br>Yes Fitz flipped scum, but how did this conftown you?"}

Mobile so no fancy linking but earlier itg in response to nacho I explained why I was scumreading vedith. I left it because nobody else pushed the read at the time, and day 1 I said I was willing to lynch out of the 4 people and one did get a couple voted so I joined and they flipped scum. Vedith wasn't really town read for me ever, I misworded that. I believed that frank and you were the scum so PoE wise vedith would be town. However, Frank is no longer likely scum, so that slot opens right up. Twiszted is the biggest source - vedith is mostly null or slight scum lean, but twiszted looked really scummy (I explained why earlier) and the combination reinforces scum vedith. I was never not willing to lynch vedith, but I'm new and the more experienced townies getting on board with scum vedith reinforces my reads. I don't remember 1161  to 1221 specifically by numbers and I'm on mobile so checking is a pain in the ass. Scum deers and creeps were never as scummy as vedith, I still think io's RVS posts are disgustingly scummy but I was told not to read into it as early as it was so I dropped that, and creeps I've reconsidered.<br><br> A lot of this also comes from trusting nachos hard town read on aristo when I don't see it so I'd like nacho to say if he still believes it and give a better explanation."}

DO YOU HAVE ANY READING COMPREHENSION?</div></blockquote><br>This addresses the something I asked aj to do line. Are you calling thst a push on me? You never even stated you scum read me, never mind voted me. You actually haven't posted a read on me since like mid d1... or replied to my scum reads on you at all until aj mentioned me as his (only so far) scum read. <br><br>If you want me to talk personally, I'm not a newbie, I just play on sites with communities that respect me. A personal flaw I have is that I can't take criticism from people I consider worse than me and I skipped the part of acquiring respect on ms and as a result I've met several people on here that I can't stand and basically killed myself in this community so I'm leaving when my games are done. That's fine. The meta here is very different anyways.  I take criticism 100% and adapt my game based on how my last one goes. So, if you were to flip town, I'd look at you again as someone I scumread to see where I went wrong. Here's the thing: I can't go into more detail because ongoing but there hasn't been a single game on this site where I haven't been scum read by old players. I appear as a helpless whiny newbie which makes scummy old people think I'm an easy push or think whiteknighting me locks in an easy vote as scum. It didn't work out in 1850 (gamma was in it) where I was the earliest to read scum, and that's the only game that I can directly reference. I do good when I play with people who know how to read people who play in a different meta. It's very different from reading your own site. That mostly happened so far this game so I doubt I'll get mislynched at this stage but who knows. It's a personal flaw that I refuse to act like a newbie and I'm definitely not perfect. But anyways, tangent point being that you're scum and I'm not the easy newbie mislynch you want. New to ms =/= new to the concept of mafia.<br><br><br><br><br>I explained why vedith was scum to nacho a long time ago, look in my iso. He said it was fair. The confirmed townies dropped it so I did, I explained my thoughts already and if they are telling me they disagree I don't scum read vedith strong enough to value arguing. To appease you after posting I'm going to go read through the numbers you linked regardless of being on mobile, survivor finale just ended and I'm bored regardless."}

Doesn't something seem very weird there?<br><br>I don't really want to do anything more with Ari because that's all he talks about Fitz in a relative sense (not a bad thing since Fitz has been V/LA)<br><br>There's nothing wrong with three people voting in the same exact way if it's for 110% valid reasons but I don't think this reason is 110% valid. There are certainly cracks and no one is following havingfitz. I think these reasons can be legitimate with the next post that he writes but not at the current moment.<br><br>Here are some reasons that fitz does draw actual concern though:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8538813#p8538813\" class=\"postlink\">post 286</a>, havingfitz wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8538770#p8538770\" class=\"postlink\">post 284</a>, TwoFace wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8538754#p8538754\" class=\"postlink\">post 283</a>, MisaTange wrote:</cite>her replacing out is NAI imo regardless of reasons</div></blockquote><br>1.

The fact this is toward TwoFace before the vote and then he votes TwoFace after listing multiple scumreads - especially with TwoFace arguably being the weakest of the bunch - is very weird. There's some sort of tunnel vision that Fitz is applying and it's not great. Started with Io in the beginning to a small degree, now it's straight onto TwoFace.<br><br>I also think that the response to me in 358 says a lot about Fitz's opinions of the game rather than opinions in general. The first two statements on VIs is ignorable because there's no reason to lie in that situation. Moving on from there:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8542420#p8542420\" class=\"postlink\">post 358</a>, havingfitz wrote:</cite>The things he says and does are still fair game for assessing his alignment.  I'm not and haven't been willing to just discard him for being new to this site. </div></blockquote>This is the real meat of the situation. The fact that Fitz can't distinguish that some one, who is new, cannot have a different playstyle that would react differently to the overall alignment of a player is just straight up not true. There's no way Fitz can say that with a straight face without trying to convince himself of that fact.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8542420#p8542420\" class=\"postlink\">post 358</a>, havingfitz wrote:</cite> Prior to the mason claims and Deer replacing in, Eric was lower down on my radar and not in conflict with your adamant mindset.

It certainly seems to be that way and links back to what I said at the top. Eric is probably 3rd lynch material for Fitz.<br><br>I know how to best play from a scum perspective and Fitz does that. Not from his words but from the long-term game. Am I willing to vote on that now? Yeah - maybe at the end of a BW or if nothing else really strikes anyone.

When talking about who he was willing to wagon, the people who he is willing to lynch are Hiraki and Creeps and Fitz but he'd rather lynch Hiraki and Creeps over Fitz; this seems especially odd since his top three suspects (in order) before were 1) Creeps, 2) Gamma, and 3) fitz, so you'd think that even if he was townreading Gamma all of a sudden fitz would still be a stronger read than Hikari.<br><br>I'll break down why some of Deer's specific posts bother me in a little bit.</div></blockquote><br>These are Deer thoughts @Vedith."}

I find it a bit weird that the three people that Gamma has scumread (HF, Me, Ved) are the three people that have been in focus the most. The discussion on other players is minimal at most.

Here are some more things that have been concerning.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8574905#p8574905\" class=\"postlink\">post 676</a>, Gamma Emerald wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8574895#p8574895\" class=\"postlink\">post 674</a>, MathBlade wrote:</cite>Day one lynches on scum are fucking hard.Compromises will almost always end up in town D1.

Not enough for me to take action with him but also not enough for me to take action against him. Looking back at it and the way you explained it, that may have been an error in judgment.<br>2) Much like number 1, people have very very large differences in the way they treat newbies. Even though I said the vanilla stuff above, I really like PRs to get rid of that part. It's obtrusive but the best way to put it. I would rather base my scumreads or townreads on tangible scumtells."}

I can't really decide. I really think both are scummy as shit but I also highly doubt they're both scum, so idk where my brain is going. Hiraki is most likely better because an aj flip doesn't give us anywhere near as much info in the event of a town flip. Ajs bad post on me and then disappearing when confronted is weird af, and hiraki immediately joining that is also weird. Hiraki has done some very odd things such as constant questioning over something he ended up misreading, and him questioning me asking aj to build a case on me was dumb because hiraki didn't build a case on me. I've already made posts about why io/deers were scum. I'm wrong on one of them probably so I need time to think about which. Meanwhile, as of now I'd rather hiraki lynch, so my vote is there."}

Context: Fitz has started his wall posts by this post, and I think the four-call scum post (with the bad line endings that made it look like a poem) had already come through. There's reason to vote him. To this point, Ari addresses Fitz on a vote for Io(deer)(my) slot's vote on an inactive, voting for Fitz in RVS. Once more later basically on sarcasm which was basically NAI all around. Anyways, there's reason for a Fitz lynch. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8548519#p8548519\" class=\"postlink\">post 435</a>, Gamma Emerald wrote:</cite>I'm dead serious: if we end up not having a decent lynch at deadline I suggest we PL Creeps because his play will get in the way of the town.</div></blockquote><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8548610#p8548610\" class=\"postlink\">post 437</a>, Aristophanes wrote:</cite>I'd be down <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\"></div></blockquote><br><br>Exchange goes together. Gamma advocates the PL on Creeps, Ari shows interest and in fact subsequently votes for creeps on the admitted PL. Both bad by Gamma and Creeps. Major issue is there's two posts between this and his fitz vote. First, one complaining about Creeps posting a huge wall for nothing more than a line response. The second correcting a grammatical mistake in his post brought up by another player. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8553672#p8553672\" class=\"postlink\">post 482</a>, Aristophanes wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8553620#p8553620\" class=\"postlink\">post 480</a>, Creeps20 wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8553604#p8553604\" class=\"postlink\">post 479</a>, TwoFace wrote:</cite>Nah it's been inactive for a while.</div></blockquote><br>Has it?

Can't remember why he scum reads Fitz but knows Creeps is bad, who he moved initially onto a policy lynch. Nothing in Creep's iso is town, but no reference of a specific point. The only saving grace is he thinks Eric is scum. Before you start this shit of \"oh but he's VI/Conf town\", foot in mouth and continue reading. <br><br>Eric's actions actually are consistent with Creeps' own actions this game. Specifically the segment about how Creeps doesn't use an avatar. It's a completely stupid notion and a newb move. Who are you actually trying to get to skip your post? Yet it was blown up to be anti-town in THIS INSTANCE where it's a site wide philosophy held by creeps (as instanced by the fact that you can't change avatars for specific threads). In the fact that he's reading his self-admitted PL and Eric the same way, there is consistency here. <br><br>The concerning part that remains is that \"Nothing town\" doesn't mean \"scum\" and as short as that bridge is between the two, Ari does nothing to build it. There's no conviction to this wagon that is now entering a range that was about to guarantee creeps' lynch.<br><br> And really, looking back we can almost assume that Creep's wagon was a COUNTERWAGON to Fitz, a scum lynch. The one who perpetuates the force of this counterwagon is actually Ari, who basically swung the top two wagons by switching from a scum read to a Gamma-admitted (and not Ari-argued) PL. <br><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8597072#p8597072\" class=\"postlink\">post 1107</a>, Aristophanes wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8597052#p8597052\" class=\"postlink\">post 1104</a>, TwoFace wrote:</cite>but you make the most sense as the scum partner, I called that shit ages ago<br><br>fitz/tvd (you)/hiraki</div></blockquote><br>&gt; Calls Fitz Scum<br>&gt; Refuses to lynch Fitz<br>&gt;&gt; Refuses to lynch Scum.<br><br>Guys, TwoFace is scum :O</div></blockquote><br><br>This was weird, because it came AFTER fitz was lynched, but before the flip. This is basically targeting out Twoface, who did get a serious case of cold feet vs Fitz but did argue it the majority of the way into existence to begin with. Ari really hadn't been this loose since far earlier in the game, too, and was late to the Fitz wagon.

How does that continue if the foundation isn't laid before you go in N3?<br><br>What needs to be done before then is LUV/Joshz need to step up to make that block. The voters from yesterday need to be strongly re-evaluated on the specific counterwagons to Fitz and the sheeping mentality needs to stop. The lack of justification in this game is going to kill it. I'm pretty sure you realize this, but there is a lot of \"administrative\" work that needs to take place before you exit."}

This hasn't been happening and is a stark contrast to a town that constantly re-evaluates those people who have joined a wagon under suspicious circumstances.

Interestingly, both Vedith and Aristophanes were on the scum lynch and not the town lynch, though us town did a great job of lynching town without scum influence (unless scum is twoface). Twoface and Sonia were on the town lynch and not the scum lynch but TwoFace was a big pusher of the scum lynch in the first place and the primary reason fitz was lynched at all so idk and Sonia didn't push the town lynch, just begrudgingly hammered. Aj was on neither lynch.<br><br><br><br><br>My current reads on everyone not green/red above:<br>TwoFace<br><br>Sonia<br>Gamma<br><br>Aristophanes <br><br>Aj<br>Vedith<br><br><br><br>Rereading day 1 and having the knowledge Hiraki was town TwoFace looked worse to me than the lock town I thought he was, but yall said nobody would SvS interact like that so I'll leave him. Sonia was the counterwagon and was good yesterday, defending Hiraki and all, though refusing to read is annoying. Gamma and Fitz probably wasnt SvS but it is a possibility. Gamma was early on the wagon though. <br><br>Then the scummier side. Aristophanes might be my number one scum read from just memory/gut: involving rereading and VCs, this read is dependant on Nacho still believing they're town too but voting with both townies and not lynching town while lynching scum is good. Aj and Vedith are PoE but I've sr'd Vedith for a really really long time, and Aj's entrance was all around bad. <br><br>HOWEVER: there is the clear issue that Hiraki thought Aj and Vedith were town. I wish he had fucking towncased Vedith but whatever. I tend to analyze dead townies reads and put a lot of stock into reads of players that are experienced, so him townreading both of them is giving me doubts. I am probably wrong somewhere and have to do some more thinking. Ngl so glad Frank was the death because I did not trust him to be bg at all and I was gonna keep questioning him. He was probably the 'ideal' nightkill for my reads if you can use ideal like that. If I were scum I'd have taken out Luv or even myself (Josh) but hey I can't see their chat."}

In particular, this is an opening that makes more sense as a VT WIFOMing than a PR WIFOMing; VTs would be doing it to increase the chance of them being night killed, PR would do it in order to decrease the chances of them being night killed because they'd hope scum would assume the first scenario. I don't think Aristophanes would be overly paranoid of drawing the nightkill normally, and so would be more likely to do this as a VT as opposed to PR, which weakens his fake PR claim down the road as scum.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8532408#p8532408\" class=\"postlink\">post 38</a>, Aristophanes wrote:</cite>Whoops, I've said too much... :S<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Fitz</span><br>Don't like the sarcasm in the jump on Io.

And, also realize that this Fitz scumread held for the entirety of the day; it ended up evolving for more than just this, but Aristo never attempted to derail the budding Fitz wagon and joined it pretty much the moment it became more viable than Creeps. He also, despite the jailkeeper claim, didn't take the opportunity to back off Fitz for a minute. If Aristo was a player that was more likely to believe that he could carry as scum, I'd maybe be more willing to believe in a bus here, but since he isn't, it doesn't make any kind of sense at all."}

The only one who knows you are town is you, so in a public VCA, you should be assumed unknown.

Aristo as scum doesn't push back against universal town reads in this way; most scum players don't. It especially doesn't make sense to make an enemy out of TwoFace when TwoFace is going to be alive after scum finish off killing LUV and I, but here Aristo is pushing back against him."}

Aristo not mentioning why he thought Creeps should just be PLed shouldn't be a dig against Aristo (why would it be?), especially when his other posts in context demonstrate that his attitude towards Creeps has been \"his posts suck, let's lynch him\" more than \"I think Creeps should be policy lynched in order to protect the game!\".</div></blockquote><br><br>I disagree.

It's just bad play. Whenever I see a lynch on anti-town, it can always be called into question if it's actually just a PL. We consider lurking anti-town, for example. <br><br>I get what Nacho said (at the time) with the claim, in the fact that it was drawing near for the day to end. However the best reaction would've been to have worked for encouraging activity early on, declaring the options real quick and pushing hard for the lynch, not asking for a L-2 claim. No one's going to let a game go to a NL night 1, or there's enough town around to prevent it. <br><br>I think the vote switch is more telling that we've been giving it credit. It's not like Gamma does a lot with that wagon outside cheerleading Creeps into existence, and the vote change back on looks opportunistic as hell. <br><br>Your original statement just made it seem like I had done nothing the entire time I've been here. That's not really true, even though the time I've been here is rather limited thus far. I've made two cases, which is more than I can say for a lot of people here. Importantly, the town is going with a 'next man up' philosophy to lynching and never once stopping to say \"hey that Hiraki lynch didn't exactly work out right\"."}

Flips scum.<br><br>D2, Nacho takes over wagon1. Frank, who had been lurking hardcore with no real attempt to play town to that point, gets pushed. Backup Bodyguard claims, wagon derails. Wagons start on Nacho's scumreads (deer/my slot, Vedith? and Hiraki). The wagon's pretty easy, is ran up high pretty easy with only real reason day isn't ended earlier is more replacements. I replace in right about now. Call Hiraki town, Josh slot scum off of some of Eric's early posts and what I had seen. Starts some pressure on me. Case made on Ari, Nacho claims Ari town off meta, would explain later. Hiraki eventually dies, claims Vedith/My slot town. Flips town. <br>-Frank dies to BG after we forced him to protect Nacho, saying he would die if nacho died before him. <br><br>-D3, wagons basically as is. Nacho makes case that Ari is town based meta and refuting case, case made on Gamma. <br><br>Overall, Uzi/Nacho are conftown. Josh is probs town. Nacho is completely convinced Ari is town.

He checks in, states he'll get to rereading, and then immediately asks AJ for a brief summary of the thread. This is off because AJ hadn't posted anything game related in a while at the time of this question and he was also the leading wagon. You haven't read the thread and you're asking the leading wagon for a summary when you have no idea of what your thoughts are on his alignment. Why would town do this? You just subbed in and you haven't read anything and you want a summary of the game from someone you don't know if you can trust yet. Just doesn't add up. <br><br>In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8661250#p8661250\">1956</a>, he gives out a read list while stating he still has not read the thread. What was the point of this? Why would town give a reads list if they have not read the thread? What's even more telling is that he's obviously lying about not having read the thread based on his read on Josh. There is no way one can have that strong of a SR on Josh if they've claimed to have not read the thread. What are you hiding from scum from lying about not having read?<br><br>Then we have his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8661295#p8661295\">1960</a> and we see where the confusion has sort of stemmed from and why VCA can never be the basis of an entire case in his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8661299#p8661299\">1961</a>. VCA lacks context and it does not always tell the whole story. <br><br>In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8661295#p8661295\">1960</a>, he says he's only looked at the vote counts and that's how he got his SR on TF. That's fine. What's not fine is that he had no intention of going back and understanding how the Fitz wagon formed based on his latter comment in his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8661401#p8661401\">1965</a> and you could argue his first point in that same post was the beginning stages of him discreditng the work TF put in by calling his policy awful. What also doesn't make it fine is when he decides to argue semantics in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8661469#p8661469\">1975</a>. Maybe policy isn't the best choice of words but it's clear that TF means a general belief and he showed examples of him following that belief in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8661416#p8661416\">1967</a>. The issue should've been dropped right then and there.<br><br>In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8661569#p8661569\">1983</a>, he claimed he finished reading Day 1 and that Gamma is the reason why Fitz was lynched. This is bull and anyone who was actually here Day 1 can tell you that's not how it went down but even if you weren't, a through reread what have told you that wagon was all TF. He also says this clears Gamma which isn't true and why does Gamma barely providing any reasons of his own and being on the wagon clears him but TF being the driving force of the wagon but hopping off because a belief he proves he actually has doesn't? This thinking doesn't sound like it's coming from town.<br><br>Fast forward to his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8664538#p8664538\">2038</a>, he says TF has been basically flip-flopping. This is another example of King having not read throughly and missing something called context. The lynch was inevitable because Day 1 exceeded way past the two week limit due to the amount of replacements and the extensions we were given. That takes a wear on players especially after so much had been discussed. In his <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8664662#p8664662\">2051</a>, he argues that lynching is something one doesn't do by themselves and plays the semantics game. If so, why give credit to Gamma for the lynch and then latter Nacho? And again, it's clear what TF means by lynching here. He is obviously saying he doesn't help lynch claimed PRs.<br><br>Here, in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8664778#p8664778\">2058</a>, is another example of where the argument should've been dropped. King brings up again that TF is trying to get town credit for lynching Fitz. Why would scum who dropped off the way King has been arguing TF did constantly bring up he was the driving force of the Fitz wagon? Makes no sense. <br><br>In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8665532#p8665532\">2108</a>, another attempt to discredit TF after he presented the argument he had for Fitz being scum in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8664729#p8664729\">2055</a> and another sign King hasn't read throughly. The reason the wagon stalled on Fitz was because we had competing wagons on Creeps and Hiraki and various people on those wagons were stubborn, including me!<br><br>--<br><br>tl:dr: King is scum because he has proven that he's unwilling to make the effort to read the thread throughly and understand context as well continue to argue semantics</div></div></div>"}

Read the pages either side of Nacho's vote if you think that reading all of Day One is too much work. Two is not the reason that the Hiraki and Creep wagons were overcome and scum got lynched.

I've basically said as much multiple times. <br><br>Cause you can't figure out that when I say I won't lynch somebody, that actually means I won't vote somebody is kind of tragic. People on this site for years have been interchanging these words so I seriously doubt it's a new concept to you. <br><br>Now for the other part.

If you're a legit town pr and at l-1, you don't risk going to bed without claiming. Not on this site where lol hammers happen all the time. <br><br>Although I did quote my policy about pr day 1. Your predecessors vote was bad. Definitely could have been for town cred. He sort of off and on pushed fitz but never had a real reason too. The one time he tried to give a reason, the reason wasn't even true. But that's off topic. <br><br>I did explain why it's a bad idea to lynch claimed PRs so I did sort of try to prevent it. If math wouldn't have been stupid and hammered via CC this game would be completely different. Town would probably be in better shape."}

Read the pages either side of Nacho's vote if you think that reading all of Day One is too much work. Two is not the reason that the Hiraki and Creep wagons were overcome and scum got lynched.

That's not remotely arguing over semantics.<br><br>I have never said that Two going off the wagon was scummy - maybe before he said the policy - although I've acknowledged that it ought to be. What is scummy is that Two won't give a straight answer to questions about why he unvoted. \"I don't lynch claimed PRs\" is nonsense; it's impossible. It is halfway between \"I won't be on the wagon of a claimed PR day one. Just won't\" and \"I'll try to keep claimed PRs from being lynched\" Posturing or protecting, but when asked directly which one he just calls me a liar and repeats his (gibberish) mantra. That's not pro-town behaviour. Perhaps it was obvious to you that he meant posturing? But where was the pro-town motivation is refusing to make it obvious to me? My question was not difficult.<br><br>He was flip-flopping in his discussion with me. I was literally the only one reading his posts in connection to me. If scum did think Having's lynch was inevitable then why the Jailkeeper claim?<br><br>\"Why would scum try to get credit for a scum lynch\" is a retarded question, and you should be ashamed for making it.<br><br>How come competing wagons stopped Having from being lynched when Two voted him first, and went down so smoothly when it was Nacho?

No. The competing wagons is obviously not a valid reason for saying why the wagon stalled with Two and went smoothly with Nacho.<br><br>Luv: in your second paragraph you are calling me a liar and saying I had read the thread.

Just read the pages in question, it's not ambiguous. Two's most recent comment on Having before Nacho's interrogation is explicitly giving up on Having been lynched Day One.

If Empking was scum not with AJ, his highest priority would be driving through the AJ mislynch. If Empking was scum with AJ, his highest priority is getting cred for his partner's lynch and preparing to go the distance. This read accomplishes neither of those purposes; giving the read over to me allows him to vote AJ, sure, but no one's giving him cred when AJ is lynched and no one's being convinced by \"I'm sheeping Nacho\".<br><br>Second of all, I've alluded to this before, but Empking's attack plan is beyond utterly insane if he is scum here. The two reads Empking has pushed since he's came are Joshz and TwoFace; after the masons, these are the two most universally townread players in the game. I suppose it's possible that Empking as scum set out to manipulate just me for a day (not likely, that's a dumb as hell strategy for the reason you're all seeing before you now), but he's a savvy enough player as scum where he realizes that this path of attack isn't getting him anywhere. The only thing that makes sense from Empking as scum here is him attempting to suicide, which he'd have no reason to do regardless of who his partner is (partner gets better cred if he looks townier as he goes down), and the only person he could be attempting to save for a day here is AJ, which doesn't make sense because AJ really shouldn't make it to endgame at this point."}

Town believe in what they're pushing, which is why Empking is holding onto these very inconvenient reads until the bitter, bitter end whereas AJ dropped his push the second it started to threaten his survival."}

I think that Josh has been putting work into the game. The reason why I've liked Joshz's contributions is because of things that he brings up that adds to cases/observations that make me feel he's being genuine - early scumread on Twisz, a few points he's brought up on Vedith, a few points he's brought up on Deer - what I don't see in his ISO are big dense walls; he's more of a real-time interaction person in that his brightest moments have come from when he's sorting out the game with others and that's a hell of a lot harder to pick up on out of context (and it's hard to keep context when catching up at a blitz pace).<br><br>So while I don't agree with Empking's read here, I at least understand where it's coming from (contrast with the AJ Eric read with didn't have a shred of truth in it), and I don't think that the case needs to be expanded upon a whole whole lot; Empking as town isn't known to be one of the GREAT EXPLAINERS and I can understand forming an initial gut read and not being able to put a bunch of hard evidence behind it and then expanding on it and evolving the read later."}

If Gamma is town to Empking's scum, then it doesn't make sense to close off a mislynch option as hard as he did here; all reasonable paths to victory have Empking voting mislynching Gamma to a win and that gets considerably more difficult if he has to walk back on words such as \"Gamma got Having lynched\" to get there. If Gamma is scum, then tying himself that hard to Gamma when he has AJ as the wide open mislynch option doesn't make sense; some people might go \"scum would never buddy that hard\", sure, but usually what happens is at the end of the day paranoia eats you alive.

We have a lot of lynching left, and we've basically won this game if we accept your aristo read. So, it's not hard to make a plan going forward, because kills are lined up."}

If Gamma is scum, then tying himself that hard to Gamma when he has AJ as the wide open mislynch option doesn't make sense; some people might go \"scum would never buddy that hard\", sure, but usually what happens is at the end of the day paranoia eats you alive.

If you were in a room with 3 Nazis and had 4 bullets in your gun, and they wanted to kill you, would you waste a shot shooting the air leaving you no chance to miss with the other three or would you shoot the Nazis and keep the 4th bullet in the chamber in case one dodged it somehow? <br>Obviously a ridiculous, exaggerated scenario, but \"lynch the goddamned scum\" is the moral here.<br><br>2. This game is not boring. I don't know where you got that from. And I don't think the preflip associative theories will be much help. I'd rather figure it out after Emp bleeds red.<br><br>3. Flipping scum gives us the most information. See point 1. Also, info lynches at this stage in the game are disgusting and you should feel bad for even suggesting it.<br><br>4. Whether you die or not, and regardless of Emp's flip, I'll look into Gamma. But we have to lynch scum today or were in a real pickle."}

Josh seems to double down on this after Aris votes EmpKing.<br>6) Josh eventually gives up on the wagon, and Hammers Emp. <br><br>All good?  Good. <br><br>What this summary ignores is Sonia.  While she was active, she played virtually no role in how the lynch went down yesterday. Mafia want to hide.  They have an instinct not to stick out.  To not make commitments.  And to avoid making contributions while it seems like they are active and helping.  <span class=\"noboldsig\">This is Sonia's play to a T yesterday!</span>.   <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8679220#p8679220\" class=\"postlink\">post 2326</a>, xSoniaNevermindx wrote:</cite>Can't say I expected that<br>I rather Gamma get lynched over EMP but I really don't have a pref cause I don't both are scum.</div></blockquote><br><br>This is Sonia's reads as of the beginning of the D4 cycle.

She's not naturally suspicious of what she should be, and doesn't seem like she's actively reading the thread or pushing anything.

Gamma was not the fish to be fried the previous day phase, fitz's push on him should have made him more clear than others imo. you voting emp and then hopping off for bad reasoning doesn't earn you town points. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8711640#p8711640\" class=\"postlink\">post 2578</a>, xSoniaNevermindx wrote:</cite>sigh is that really the best you had?<br>That was slightly boring and a bit tedious I was expecting more of a challenge.</div></blockquote><br>this is a bad post because like I said, your response to hap's posts weren't very good. <br><br><br>Right now scum is in you or hap. i can't figure out which one I think is scummier.<br><br>hard pushing against the person that was an earlier strong scum read and them flipping scum<br><br>or <br><br>doing nothing at all with regards to lynching scum<br><br><br>I don't think Ari is scum because he joined emp when he could have easily joined gamma<br><br>gamma got pushed by fitz after he joined the creeps wagon. so I don't think gamma is scum and kind of leans me towards creeps being scum.<br><br>looking at the wagon when creeps was L-1, I think every single person on that wagon was town with the exception of 2 alive and both of those 2 look pretty townie compared to the other 2.<br><br><br>Creeps20 (6): <span style=\"color: #0000FF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">ScumDeersAreVeryTasty (AJ), Hiraki</span></span>, Aristophanes, <span style=\"color: #0000FF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">MathBlade, FrankJaeger</span></span>, Gamma Emerald"}

He looks pretty bad.  I could try to look through Josh's filter and defend our slot, but I think that just isn't a credible line of argument.<br><br>In my own defense, I'll make three points:<br>1) Josh's D4 looks bad.  However, what else in his filter looks bad?  If you look at Josh's whole filter, I think you'll see someone that is town, but made some pretty poor decisions on D4.  Bad Play =/= Mafia.  Inconsistent Play =/= Mafia.  <br>2) Sonia by contrast, has been consistently suspicious since she replaced in.  I would recommend looking at her actions in the lynch on D2, where she waffles about and doesn't seem to care much about who gets lynched between two townies.  On D3, she half-heartedly pushes EMP while looking for any excuse to direct the lynch elsewhere.  I've talked about D4 in great detail.  As you talked about above, her D5 hasn't been pretty.   <br>3) Compare my contributions today to what Sonia is doing. I'm active, I'm contributing, and I'm doing my best to remain objective.  Compare this to Sonia's defense... she is basically saying that being more useful to town is boring, and that she will not change her playstyle. <br><br>I'll be around to answer questions.  I will put the effort into demonstrating my towni-ness if I am given the opportunity today."}

Sonia and EMP's individual posts were pretty good throughout the game.  However, I felt that they were far too transparent with their mafia motivations in the thread.  EMP's posting left a very powerful association case to make against Sonia.  Sonia's treatment of EMP on D3, as well as her D4 voting were huge red flags in her filter.  To some extent, both of you really need to think about what you would do as town before you take certain stances in the thread.  A solid mafia performance doesn't need to be perfect, but there needs to be just enough to cover your tracks.  <br><br>I hope I don't sound overly critical - I just want to point out what I noticed and hope people find it useful."}
