Now it's \"pretending to be [a derpwad!] and being flippant while doing so\". <br><br>He was conscious of all my silliness, but still took me seriously! Or he's backtracking like a boss! I'm voting DGB!<br><br>I thought he would be like, \"Man, I did that to throw everyone in a loop, too, man!\" and I'd be like \"Wow, guy, that's so inception!\" and no one would lol because it wouldn't be funny. But this man's guy's serious? No way!</div></blockquote><br>What backtrack?  You changed your input, I changed my approach to you.<br><br>As long as you were being intentionally silly, you were potentially hiding and not scumhunting.  I glossed over you using salient in the precise way you did.  In retrospect it should have clued me in to your intentions.  Still, I don't think I'd change anything because the pressure resulted in a decent read, just slightly later than it could have been.  <br><br>I didn't attack you to throw everyone into a loop.  I attacked you to see where you were coming from.  I found your response decently Townie, and went on to better hunting grounds.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Deltabacon wrote:</cite>Junpei's questioning of both Psyche and Fatcat looks like he's asking superficial questions at best, when everyone else is making reasonable probes and assertions to differing extents.

You were extremely adament that we outright lynch Psyche higher up on the page, <span style=\"font-style: italic\">demanding</span> votes from Junpei, Elliberetth and myself.</div></blockquote><br>Well, I certainly asked for more votes, in a way that pressured Psyche to respond.  Not sure this is \"<span style=\"font-style: italic\">demanding</span>\".  Did you just miss how I was also sounding you three out at the same time?   <br><br>Do you find it a mistake to change your mind when the evidence indicates something differrent than your initial read?  Can you expand on this \"cover-up\" idea?<br><blockquote><div><cite>Deltabacon wrote:</cite>How do you manage do go from looking at him as outright scum (and searching for a speedlynch, no less) to looking at him as Pro-Town?</div></blockquote><br>Question asked and answered.

Where was I seeking a \"speedlynch\"?<br><blockquote><div><cite>Deltabacon wrote:</cite>With a third of the players yet to post anything of substance, a bandwagon like the one he tried to get rolling on FC would be ideal if it went through, since it would leave 3 Unknowns for scum to hide in tommorow.

Trying to get a bandwagon going, or actually joining in the cool and going wagon?  Have circumstances changed with respect to how many players have contributed?"}

Your play seems a lot more townie, particularly your push on FatCat, and even more particulary the fact you quoted my post about PRs, it showed you were really trying to pick his brain. However your push didn't seem aggressive or opportunistic, like scum finding a fake \"scumslip\" and trying to back the person into a corner.<br><br>Once again, Delta's claim makes him tentatively town. If we wind up mass claiming and nothing seems to interfere, he's town. If we really decide not to mass claim, then I will probably reassess where he goes on the list.<br><br>I'm working the opposite way as a lot of people do. Most look for scum. I do that to, but I typically do it by PoE: Knock out who I think is town, due partner exclusions, then choose the lynch from there. Here's a method of what I usually do, and you can look at it in any of my past games (thoughy by now i do admittedly have 1-2 scum reads by page 10 or so, its a smaller game and im finding it a bit harder):<br><br>Players 1-9 are playing a game. I'm pretty sure 1,2,3,4 are all town. I'll be player number 5.<br><br>I see interactions that make 6 and 8 look highly unlikely (like 8 leading a wagon on 6), and see some really heavy buddying between 6 and 9. I can confidently say:<br><br>6's only possible partner is 7. Therefore, if my reads are correct, there's 0-1 scum between (6,7) and 1-2 between (8,9)<br><br>Then Id list out all the different combinations and see which pairings were most likely. Thats what I meant by partner exclusions earlier. I find the game WAY more manageable to play this way then just trying to figure out scum individually (I suck at single scum tells)."}

Don't bother using \"gut\" response; and being voted because of being active seems like an unfair coincidence to use to write off the case on DLG.</div></blockquote><br>I don't want this to be forgotten: Respond to this asap, and while you're at it give us all your scumreads and an updated read of Deltawave - your current one is honestly incomprehensible and I'd like more explanation.</div></blockquote><br>1.  Nothing I can do about your misunderstanding my tone.  I came off Psyche for the exact reasons stated.  He showed a willingness to be involved and explained the purpose of his first post.  Since I was mistaken about his intent, I unvoted.  I voted your for the reason stated.  Your first post looked suspicious.  <br><br>2.  This has been answered.  You can elect to ignore the explanation.  Their behaviors were not the same thing, in my view.<br><blockquote><div><cite>DLG wrote:</cite>The post Deltabacon replied to contained FatCat's vote on Psyche. This was the second vote, and was clearly not RVS.<br><br>My conclusion is that Deltabacon would have seen this and chose to only reply to the out of game thing.<br><br>My conclusion regarding Ellibereth is that he replied to an in game thing.<br><br>It's not a huge disparity, but enough for me to differentiate between them.</div></blockquote><br><br>3.  I really don't get what you're saying.  My comment to you from Post #12 was valid, at the time it was made.  Psyche wasn't scumhunting in a form I recognized.  I was correcting a portion of the question you posed to Psyche, to illustrate my problems with his first posts.<br><br>4.  I don't think saying someone is right-brained is an insult.  Why do you?  <br><br>Worse (from your logical point-of-view), your conclusion from the exchange is utterly illogical.<br><br>The premise was that I was not being logical in this game, therefore, I was scummy.  I agreed that I was not being logical.  I said to take a look at my past games to see that I can be logical.  Most of my past games are me as Town, like everyone else.  So, I was pointing out how my play is different in this game versus my past games.  To illustrate to FatCat how erroneous he was in basing a judgement of my mind on the posts from this game.<br><br>And, you conclude that I was trying to point to my past games to show how closely I was matching my Town meta in this game?  How did you arrive at your conclusion?<br><br>What good point did I dodge?  The one about disengage/re-engage?  Again, this has been explained.  After I said disengage, FatCat went scummy in a new and exciting fashion.  I re-engaged on those grounds.  His point was faulty, and supported by evidence that deliberately was missing a crucial piece.  You've since tried to make this seem like a great point.  It was bunk, then and now.<br><br>5.  At 77, I wanted to illustrate a facet of FatCat's scumminess that he had only shown after 65.  Does that make it clear?"}

Fair enough.  I felt it was the right thing to do, at that time.  Both the unvote and the subsequent vote movement(s).<br><br>3.  You're correct.  There was a flaw in the logic contained in my question to you.  I was mostly concentrated on his first post.  His next two posts, though, read in-line with my mistaken impression that he was just going to fluff around and flaunt being goofy.  It wasn't until he was willing to take a stand based on his reading of my reaction to his generalized \"reaction test\" that I was willing to move on.  I didn't realize his intentions until he explained it.<br><br>4.  Again, I didn't see that as an insult.  As for illogic=scummy, from FatCat's point of view, see below.<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4118812#p4118812\" class=\"postlink\">post 41</a>, FatCat wrote:</cite>I think it's more heavily weighted towards mafia, I think anything that seems suspicious or illogical, is always more weighted towards mafia.</div></blockquote><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4118878#p4118878\" class=\"postlink\">post 43</a>, FatCat wrote:</cite>Nailed on mafia. Being illogical and telling lies</div></blockquote><br>I think there's probably more, but his overall tone has been to try to equate logic to Townieness and illogic to scumminess.<br><br>4/2.  I thought disengaging when I brought it up was the right play because I felt the one on one between me and FatCat was threatening to be the only topic of conversation.  I felt justified re-attacking based on his follow-up of trying insult away any credence other players might give to my points.  It's not scummy to disengage.  It's scummy to say, \"Yeah, I'll let it go, you're just a nuisance, and I don't have to bother responding to you.  I look better than you, anyway.\""}

There's some good theory on this that I read in the MD forum...I'll bring it up if ncessary.

If the set of {me, FatCat, Junpei, farside22} is all Town, this is just about a perfect Day for scum!Iknal and partner.  Between knowing I'm Town, and my reads on Junpei and farside22, this idea is not far-fetched.<br><br>I'm still very much in favor of the FatCat lynch.  I don't believe anything he's posted is inconsistent with him getting a scum role PM.  This is taking into account what I believe was unvarnished truth, here.<br><blockquote><div><cite>FatCat wrote:</cite>Don't be perplexed. I haven't been been putting in great effort since day 1 or 2. This is my first game and I had no idea these games were taken so seriously or went on for so long, I will happily say I am the village idiot.<br><br>That being said, I made a commitment to Amrun when I started this game that I wouldn't flake, so I am happy to see the game through to the end. I'm not going to put in the same levels of research or be as meticulous in what I say as Junpei, Psyche or Slaxx are. If the town went to lynch me, that's fine, I'm not the most useful poster in this thread (although it would be a misslynch). This will be my first and last game on this site, this site isn't really for me.</div></blockquote><br><br>If FatCat flips Town, I'd investigate Iknal.  If FatCat flips scum, I'd investigate Psyche.  Will explain this below.<br><br>I don't see any difference in tone or intent in Junpei's push on farside22 as compared to his push on me.  Both seem designed to pressure what he believes are scum.  I don't think he's wrong to think that farside22 was contradicting her stated stance with respect to the viability of OMGUS as a tell.  The basic problem I see with how farside22 went about things is that she didn't differentiate that FatCat's OMGUS was done in a scummy fashion as compared to how Town would OMGUS.  In her push against FatCat, it was just \"look at the OMGUS, lynch him\".  That indicates a belief that OMGUS is a scum-tell.  I acknowldege that there was much more to the case, but this is specifically commenting on how she presented just this portion of the case.  That makes Junpei's push justified.<br><br>From farside22's point-of-view, though, I don't think she was contradicting herself.  I can see how FatCat's posts can be read as scum OMGUS.  Since it seems that this was the primary way she digested and processed FatCat's posts/votes, it's not contrary to her belief that OMGUS (as a stand alone behavior) is null.  From the perspective of wanting to push for a lynch on a scum read, using the commonly accepted vernacular to get her point across is acceptable.  The burden of showing how FatCat's particular OMGUS behavior was scummy (to separate from her stance from another thread) wouldn't occur to her, unless she was overly conscious of making sure to not violate her \"meta\".<br><br>TL;DR re: Junpei v farside22<br>Town v Town<br><br>The push against farside22 was precipitated by Psyche's case.  At face value, it looks Town motivated.  It shows investment in discovering and lynching scum.  I'm uncertain as to how he came away from the validity of it.<br><br>This brings me to why I'd look at Psyche if FatCat flips scum.  The timing of Psyche's case coincided with growing FatCat dislike.  Also, the disparaging defense of FatCat bugs me.  I can see a scum motivation behind saying, \"pay no attention to that guy, he's really just a VI.\"  It serves to place his hypothetical partner in a fairly safe position.  The push which generated the counter-wagon of farside22 is self-explanatory as a scum move.<br><br>This theory is not fool-proof.  But, if FatCat does flip scum, I would definitely want it ruled out via investigation.<br><br>I'm willing to believe both Deltabacon and Ellibereth unless and until game events prove otherwise.  Of the two, I think Ellibereth's is more believable.  It fully explains his push for a mass-claim and confirms him as Town except in la-la land.  I always have some disbelief of a Cop claim generated by being put to L-1, but meh.  For some out-guess the Mod thoughts, why put a Cop in a game advertised as being for players who want to concentrate on scum-hunting?  Probably paranoia talking, but it still itches at the back of my head.<br><br>Slaxx, I'm absolutely null on.  His impact on the game appears inoffensive, for lack of a better word.  This bugs me at a paranoia level, but I certainly don't consider him a scum read."}

Basically, FatCat town=Junpei town. The problem with this is no one works well with FatCat as scum, meaning either someone did some decent bussing or it is the Psych. It would be a hard decision for me because Psych is definitely a pretty confident town read.

Also, a FatCat scum flip means DLG town.<br><br>I'm up for a lynch in either Iknal (strongest scum read) or FatCat (think he is a little more likely to flip town, but we get to strike out a lot of possibilities if he flips scum and can let psych off the hook if he's town).<br><br>Investigation wise, I don't see why we wouldn't investigate KK at this point unless his next post rains down towniness from the heavens or whatever."}

Reading the game when you aren't in it and trying to find scum is a completely different experience than getting a role PM and knowing:<br>1. What you do now has impact on the game (rereading the game thoroughly and dedicating an appropriate amount of time to scumhunting, which of course is more than a person not playing, and of course is best accomplished by rereading and combing through the thread)<br>2. You are responsible for your actions and opinions (once again, now that you are playing an active and influential part in the game, you want to make sure youre confident in reads)<br>3. You have to communicate your thoughts (the most important: you need to have specific evidence from the thread, quotes, post numbers, etc, which is of course best accomplished by rereading. How else am I supposed to consicely and effectively communicate my opinions? \"Oh in that one post around page 3\" or \"Post 62\"...Obviously second. And since I did not have to communicate as a third party observer, I naturally had no notes or post numbers written down)<br><br>I'm surprised I even have to explain this. KK's first point it literally \"He reread the thread after role PM, this makes him scum\" when I think its pretty obvious this is a null tell: the best way to do a catchup post is to have the thread ready and on hand and go through and comment on things. This isn't something I should have to explain.<br><br>-Yeah, look back at the game we played where you were scum and I was town. I'm always eager to claim my role (its the desert game hosted by UN kahn), I did it pretty sporadically there too. I was town. VT, actually. The night talk thing is BS, I am pretty sure I outlined why waiting one day might be better. Also, I don't know if its anywhere ON the site, but Reg and I agree a lot that the best time to claim is after a Scum roleblocker flip if there is one. In this case, a single scum PR flip would be enough for me to advocate it the next day.<br><br>-And yeah, my posts ARE scumhunting, I've explained how I scumhunt and you know how I do it Kahn, I did a similiar thing in your game. Look at it from my point of view: There 2 clears, possibly a third tomorrow, and I have two strong town reads. I don't have to find scum, I literally have an extra lynch if a town read is wrong, or if something fucks with the cop. Literally all I have to do is see if anyone doesn't fit with anyone else and then use PoE to find the best lynch. Why try to find the two scum in the group of four, which by the way I'm terrible at and have already explained that, and instead just PoE the fuck out of the game by excluding partners? It works so much better for me and its even MORE advantageous here because of the amount of clears and obvtown there are."}

(\"LITERALLY IMMEDIATELY\"). Then you entered the game, re-read and commented on everything. Taking special care to note everything about the whole opening segment. Then iso-25 posts in, you note that your scum read on DLG was pre-re-read read that you never mentioned. So was the re-read for show if it didn't change your opinions on anyone? Why didn't you explain your DLG-scum read earlier when you were summarizing? <br><br>I admit it's not a total slam dunk (maybe a poor lay-up at best), but it definetely feels like there's some duplicity at work.<br><br>2) Yeah, I remember that game. It was a heartbreaker. But it's somewhat moot. <br><br>This:<br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>The night talk thing is BS, I am pretty sure I outlined why waiting one day might be better. Also, I don't know if its anywhere ON the site, but Reg and I agree a lot that the best time to claim is after a Scum roleblocker flip if there is one. In this case, a single scum PR flip would be enough for me to advocate it the next day.</div></blockquote><br>is not the same as this:<br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Elli we can claim tomorrow after we lynch scum today just in case our inv role is tracker k</div></blockquote><br>You can't just re-invent your argument based on something you said to someone somewhere at sometime. You may truly believe the above quote, but I'm holding you responsible for what you've actually said. <br><br>In this game, you said that we should wait because we might have a tracker, not because we should have a scum PR flip first. Why? Are you, as scum, worried about being tracked? <br><br>3) I got caught up in the game and the first thing I asked myself was \"whose reads do I not automatically know off the top of my head?\" which is another way to ask \"who is playing the safe game?\" and surprise, it's the same guy that I made a note about his re-reading and the mass claim reaction. <br><br>The half-finished paragraphs and charts and spoilered stuff that I linked to earlier just really seems to look like you're scum stalling for time by saying \"don't bother me, i'm 'scumhunting'\". But it never amounted to anything. It's a smokescreen. You started it on the 19th, then vanished for a few days, then miraculously showed up when the lynch of FatCat was about to happen with convenient cop-directions. <br><br>I understand that pairings is a scum-hunting style. But it's incredibly easy to fake as scum and incredibly easy to deceive as scum when you announce that you're doing it on Day 1."}

I'll say one more time, and re iterate my last point: there is a difference between following along and playing. I'm not gonna waste anymore time on this point:<br><br>-In order to communicate specifics from the thread, the easiest way to do that is to reread and comment on things as I go. I didn't give any reads at all during that first half I don't think, any scum reads anyway. I was waiting to get through the thread.<br><br>2. Okay true, those are both valid separate reasons. If we had a tracker, then they should stay hidden, obviously. They can't get roleblocked hidden and are utterly useless for gathering clears until one scum remains, which can only happen post-day-1. Either way, waiting makes sense from a town point of view. I finally just caved in and claimed later just like I randomly claimed in Desert as town. <br><br>3. Your reading comprehension sucks then. I have specifically said (Elli/Psyche/Delta/Junpei) are all almost deftown, with Elli and Delta being deftown. And I had Elli as almost for sure town before that claim. I am not really playing the safe game at all: I have 2 very strong town reads that I highly doubt I will budge from. And recently, I said DLG feels more likely to be town than the other three too. Naturally, then, I am ok with lynching in between (Farside/You/FatCat). I shouldn't have to explicitly state those as my scumreads, it should be pretty implied. And I finished the chart in that post with spoilers, btw. I just didn't bother coding it because fuck coding it."}

Its small enough to easily confirm people. I saw him and was pretty sure he was claiming PR.

Okay true, those are both valid separate reasons. If we had a tracker, then they should stay hidden, obviously. They can't get roleblocked hidden and are utterly useless for gathering clears until one scum remains, which can only happen post-day-1. Either way, waiting makes sense from a town point of view.

You claimed VT on Page 34 (Day 2) and after you were virtually confirmed as town (from the RisingPhoenix lynch). It changed nothing about that game expect the fact that you were a slightly lower NK target for scum. Now DietyKabuto actually did claim early and unprovoked in that game and when you replaced in you called the move \"dumb\".<br><br>I don't see how this supports your argument of \"I always randomly claim my role\". Actually, I'm not seeing how the \"I always randomly claim my role\" argument does anything to explain why you wanted everyone else to claim their roles.<br><br>3) Having nothing but town-reads and lynching from PoE choices is very much a safe scum play. Do you realize how easy it is to go from a town read on someone to a scum read? It takes one post. Compare that to how easy it is to go from a scum read to a town read on someone. There is so much red tape and aggravation involved in trying to justify that sort of radical change that most people just say \"He went from scum to null\". <br><br>Choosing a lynch based on PoE relieves you of the guilt of making a bad case.

That's paranoia, hyperbole, and maybe even confirmation bias.<br><br>Kublai is a bit of a fool I agree - And I am going to ask you why his read on Farside in the post I linked to is insufficient.

One moment DGL has a town mind set, then null, then scummy. <br>4) False/misrepresentation of fact (see post 418 from Slaxx).<br>4a) His pairs are based on interaction that are false, however seems to only put KK with me for no reason stated other then POE<br>5) Noted buddying of Jun and Psyche, Psyche was early game, with following of Jun late in day one. (see late into day one and once Jun comments about a player, Slaxx vomit of repeating the same crap)<br>6) just today, way, way over reaction to pressure of votes, panic over two votes and calls it scum looking for a mislynch<br>7) redirecting away from himself and onto others"}

You're taking a common stance I take and saying I'm appealing to something.  It doesn't have anything to do with anything.

You don't seem like someone who is trying to determine the alignment of other people, but like someone who is trying to make others look suspicious so you can mislynch them.  Your demeanor throughout the entire game has been that way."}

That's a ridiculous notion, and fits with scummy behavior.  In fact, you have experience with me Junpei; you know that I'm not fixed in my reads.  You've seen me change my mind enough to know that I don't hunt for reasons to find people scum without reason.<br><br>In fact, if you were paying attention, I called Slaxx town last night upon replacing in from something he said.

There was absolutely no way I could have a scum read on you, so for you to get all upset about it and want an answer makes you look really suspicious.

Really. It's easy to follow along and give agreements and credence when you see people already suspicious of a player. <br>Are you saying you never never did that as scum?<br><br><br>Oh look who is not here during this exchange of talks in the game.....Slaxx/Psyche. <br><br>*Note for later* look to see if this was a trend all game long.</div></blockquote><br><br>I don't know.  I sometimes don't have reasons for why I have reads or change my reads.  Sometimes I just read something genuine in a post and I have a read.  I don't even know how to pinpoint it sometimes.  And yeah, I've had people give me crap for it.  But because it's something that I personally do, I can't fault someone else for it.<br><br>Hmm...I've actually only played scum 3 times, so it's kind of hard to say what I've never done as scum.  But, actually as a general tendency, no.  Though I have exploited general opinion, I'm more inclined to go against general opinion when scum not with (though I do this as town too).<br><br>Psyche being absent is troubling, and I'd like to know why so many people have such strong townreads of him."}

Everything is too stream of conscious and too not serious. Then when addressing your suspicion on me in a formal fashoin, you use buzzphrases you can't back up with evidence and what you've said about it is irrational and I can't rationalize it from a town point of view. I'm further frustrated because I don't know how much of me thinks you're scum and how much thinks you're just annoying.<br><br>pedit: You said that it was scummy to suspect someone for the reasons I did.

I find your facts about my posting history interesting.  Certainly, I have posted more than normal levels in the past 25 hours, but it does take some posts to interact with people and as I have time today, well that\u2019s going to happen.  If you think I\u2019m going to have this many posts every day, well you can rest your little head that I won\u2019t.  <br><br>It is of interest to note that those snide comments as you demonstrate came after a post made by you in which you alluded to me making an appeal to emotion and a faulty implication.  If you don\u2019t like snide comments, one would think that you wouldn\u2019t take such a haughty tone when addressing others.  I suppose maybe you don\u2019t realize that you constantly take a condescending tone with whomever you are speaking, but alas this is the truth.<br><br>I deeply regret that you hate that I won\u2019t stop talking, but you might note that I am speaking in response to being spoken to just like an honorable young woman does, with the exception of my spamming of the night before.  I am likewise filled with sorrow that you believe I am not being serious in my thoughts or communications.  I\u2019m quite certain that, with the exception of my catch up posts, my thoughts have not been too stream of conscious and have contained my rather serious opinions on this game.  I do utterly believe that it is suspicious that you keep dismissing my thoughts and opinions.<br><br>I also apologize that I haven\u2019t backed up my buzzphrase use, but honestly am at a loss about what you are speaking.  If you could fill me in on the buzzphrase in question, I would be happy to either back it up or accept my mistake in using something I am clearly too mentally deficient to use properly.<br><br>I can assure you that I won\u2019t get over my belief in how scum hunt.  I did assert that I am aware that town hunt this way too at times, but you might also want to care at least a little bit.  If, after I iso you, I still believe that you are scum as I read last night, I will present a case and push for your lynch.  It\u2019s the rarest of occasions that I am unable to get someone lynched when I truly believe in their lack of innocence.  But, like I said, I haven\u2019t iso\u2019d you yet and since I am a seven year old with a raging case of ADHD, I am liable to change my opinions on people at a moment\u2019s notice.  However, the way you\u2019ve devolved into attacking my person for next to no reason at all doesn\u2019t give me hope that my opinion of your alignment is going to change.<br><br>I again humbly apologize for misrepresenting your mental faculties.  You see, I have this problem wherein I believe that other people have memories that work as well as mine, and since I remember your play quite well considering the game we played in together wasn\u2019t too long ago, I apparently mistook your ability to remember.  This was especially so considering how quickly you realized my vanilla stance was incompatible with previous stances.  I, however, am completely swayed by your assertion that your memory is, in fact, deficient because you claim to remember me as a calm person.  Anyone who has played a mafia game with me would be woeful at making such a claim with a straight face.  However, I am filled with intrigue over your assertion that you barely remember my play, yet you stated that you remembered emotion that was irritating.  Junpei, this appears to be a contradiction in your memories or at least your claims of memories.  Either you remember me as calm or you remember me as emotional, or you barely remember me at all.  According to you contradictions are scum tells, so will you just go ahead and agree with me now that you are scum?<br><br>I am uncertain what your point is about your favorite author.  No, I was unaware that your favorite author is someone I have never heard of.  It hardly matters to the situation, but as long as we are sharing, my favorite author is Homer and my favorite book is the Iliad.<br><br>I am overjoyed that you are going to resist stooping to my level.  I look forward to the day when I can stop personally insulting you for no reason as well.  I deeply regret you felt anger when I felt that emotion not at all.<br><br>In all seriousness,<br>~Tammy"}

You remember me as calm and you remember me as emotional.  Those are seeming contradictions, no?  But, they're not; they are me...you are remembering correctly.  They are contradictions and they are correct, so not all contradictions are indicative of scum because they can be contained in one alignment/person.  (Btw...I wasn't emotional when you asked me to get some sleep before answering a question.  I literally hadn't slept for weeks and my coherence was near gone.  You told me I wasn't making sense, I agreed it was possible because I was so tired, you agreed to wait for me to answer your question until I could get some sleep and make sense.)<br><br>Okay fine, you remember sweeping personalities.  I don't get worried easily.  I get emotional easily but not worried or nervous.<br><br>I'm not trying to flex win ratios...you said you weren't worried and no one would buy my crap.  I'm just pointing out that it's flawed.<br><br>-------<br><br>Still interested in Slaxx's read on me.  Whether it's town or scum...looking forward to the reasons.  Yes, I know that I said earlier that not having reasons means town, but this is important to me and how I'll be able to read Slaxx.<br><br>Psyche - Like his early aggressiveness.  He disappears though in day two.  I don't know what to make of that.  Gonna put him as a light town though for now though.  I want to read back through his iso though, there's something nagging me that I can't quite put my finger on.  It could be that it looks like he's active lurking though.<br><br>Rainbowdash - Town, right?  Do I need to really ISO?  If he's the cop though, why didn't he die last night?<br><br>Slaxx - I didn't even have to get through half his iso to confirm my town read on him.  Like I really don't see the points against him at all.  Slaxx, though, I really really need for you to tell me when and how you changed your read on Junpei.  He's your strongest town read now, but he wasn't on day one.  I remember from  the game we played together that you said you were susceptible to buddying by scum.  I'll have to read to see if Junpei employed that method - though I'm guessing not since Farside has accused you of buddying Junpei - but still.  I'd like to know that read.  The only thing that causes me some concern is that there was no vote at the end of yesterday.  And the only reason why it causes me concern is because typically scum partners try not to be on the same lynches, and he's the only person not on the day one lynch.  But, it's not that big of a deal as that isnt' an exact sicence anyway.  Slaxx town hunts and scum hunts through PoE.  I hate that type of scumhunting, but it's how some people do it and I'm not going to criticize over much, especially considering that Junpei is making light of how I scum hunt.  But, because he scumhunts this way I don't follow the criticism against him.  Like seriously, if he turns out not being town I'll be pretty surprised.  Although, his read on me should really help me determine his alignment so...<br><br>All right that's it for tonight.  I'm tired.  I'll try to finish the rest of the iso's and reads tomorrow but Sundays are busy for me so it might not be until Monday."}

Its not really be pushed on by anypony but maybe Slaxx again, and it more seems to be a distraction from what has been going on.<br>4) DGL-Tammy are a tale of two players, I really disliked DGL but sorta like Tammy play.  I would hold that lynch on similar grounds as Junepi at this point.  I do think Tammy would have read a scum QT that should have pointed out me-cop, but at the same time snap claim is a little iffy.  I guess I would vote Junepi over her at this point but not by much.<br><br>The play of Slaxx really doesnt seem like town around the massclaim scenario though.  If you at all thought there was going to be a non-investigation power (GF/RB) then it was a bad idea to claim at that juncture in the game.  Slaxx saying he \"hoped it was RC\" when I think he unprompted brought up RBer again at some point just rings like scum who know that a massclaim in this small of a setup should give them the upperhand.  Basic rule of hoof, the smaller the setup the more a D1 massclaim benifits scum, the bigger it gets the more roles there tend to be for scum to have to deal with so more town power to draw off of that can be used.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote Slaxx</span><br><br>Probably with one of Tammy/Junepi<br>I would put a lynch tier something like..<br><br>Slaxx<br>Tammy/Junepi<br>Psyche<br>KK/Farside"}

At least the hardcore emotional knee jerk.  I think American Gods (which we should have won because if nopony realizes a VC error for almost a week is should stand) is a good example of this being more of a town farside move.  If she is scum she has to be goon, as RBer esentially would be game throwing by making that move and farside is smart enough not to do that I think.<br><br>So in a sense the offchance of hitting a goon today makes me want to keep her alive, even though as im typing this I fell into a similar trap to postpone a scum lynch in a different game is nagging at me.

Scum would know this, but if momentum is pushing that direction they would not fight it to much.  Junepi notes that its probably bad, but still pushes for a massclaim because it might work.  This is approximately the stance that I would expect scum to take in a \"its bad but if you insist\" approach that does nothing to stop it but takes the correct side of the coin looking back.<br><br>2) The whole FC thing.<br><br>The case on FC from Junepi was actually more or less my reasoning for FC-town.  Additonally I would have wanted a FC lynch badly as scum in this situation because if the RBer got lynched, that essentially confirmed FC as town due to all the mountainous talk.

I could really care less for the most part if somepony is in what I think is the right spot for the wrong reasons.  It seems like a really bizzare point to be pushing for.

However, I also recognized that I was the only one who felt that way. Instead of grinding on a chalkboard and being the only one to not claim, I decided to go with it and try to keep order (see: me telling DLG to claim next and then I think it was Slaxx who did what I was trying to prevent and  broke the chain) to make it at least efficient.

But, I didn't even get my team QT until much later that evening, so I could be getting them mixed up.  I didn't even really read the scumQT the first day.  I skimmed it at some point and saw that the whole team talked about bussing each other.  I feel like I posted first because if I would have known the plan was to group bus, I might not have given Jason a town read.  But I remember talking to Oversoul in the team QT and he told me about the bussing plan and where I went wrong, and I said I knew and told him that sometimes the best distancing is no distancing and I decided to give one partner a town read and one a scum read.  I did go back and read it when Deltawave was saying that he thought I read information in my scumQT wrong, and I thought that maybe he was giving me a hint that I wasn't going according to the plan, so yeah, this is probably a lot more words than you need for me to say I don't really remember.<br><br>The only thing I know for sure is that I read the thread first.

Oh and the fake day vig...which I'm going to have to nod my head in the direction of Rainbowdash that this does sort of fit town meta I suppose, meh.  It's still stupid and should stop.<br><br>Seriously, if anyone wants to see a serious disconnect look at the way Junpei reacts to me upon arrival.  Demands that I claim, I claim, he asks why I claimed, tells me that my saying I don't care about claiming vanilla is awful, within four minutes finds a post I made in which I told someone in another game claiming vanilla was stupid, interprets it badly, appeals to buzzword which he's already claimed are used by scum, claims I was a much more careful player in GvE, wants to know why I attacked him by asking him if he was scum upon replacing in, remembers that I post long, detailed posts, then claims he barely remembers me at all.  Um <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif\" alt=\":?\" title=\"Confused\"> contradiction.<br><br>Seriously, everything about his reaction to me upon replacing in feels like scum caught for the wrong reasons.  In my first post, which came after his stupid fake day vig post, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4155589#p4155589\">Post 579</a> I make a joke about not wanting to read 24 pages to find out that Slaxx is scum and I ASK Junpei if he's scum.  I don't attack him; I don't say he's scum.  I simply say \"are you scum?\"  Not long later, he asks why I attacked him.  That post in question is the first post that I made; I made it clear that I hadn't posted anything.  The natural reaction might be to answer the question or ignore it as it's obvious that I couldn't possibly think anyone was scum at that point.  I literally called Slaxx scum in that post and he didn't react at all, but Junpei got all \"Why are you attacking me?\"<br><br>Not only does this response not make sense from a typical town perspective but it also doesn't make sense from the perspective of someone who had just attempted to gain a response from a stupid fake day vig.  It does make sense, however, from scum who are overly concerned about what people think about them.<br><br>Anyway there just isn't much that feels natural or genuine in Junpei's iso.  He's brought up GvE and he was much more natural there.  There was a whole lot that felt really genuine from him, like he was trying to figure things out.  I remember near then end when people thought he might be scum.  I got a little paranoid but still didn't want to believe it because of how genuine he felt throughout the game.  I don't get any sense of genuineness here."}

The major points of contention I have are:<br><br>1) The insta-town read on Slaxx and subsequent dismissal of my entire case. I'm kicking myself for not being around to keep the momentum up because it's a good case. Some of it may be confirmation bias, but the mental u-turn that Slaxx did regarding whether or not to mass claim is a pure scum find.

How come Slaxx got an instant town-read for this:<br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Saying that [Slaxx]'s heard I'm an easy read suggests that he's actually interested in reading my slot not that he's already determined or knows the alignment of my slot.</div></blockquote><br>But Junpei doesn't?

Pretty much all of it.  Have you ever heard of the notion that cases do more to help town evaluate the person who makes the case more than on whom the case is being made?  KK's crap case pretty much does exactly that and his whole demeanor towards me is indicative of scum distorting every single action and reaction as something indicative of scum rather than town.  And the fact that RD has me as the second likeliest person he would vote today and is calling KK town just demonstrates that he's probably going to get it to work.  And good game scum.  You've snowed town.<br><br>I've had crap cases written on me by town before, but you can usually tell when they're genuine.  The type of case he's written on me is the type I've only ever seen scum do.<br><br>1.  Apparently I'm scum for having a town read on Slaxx.  I explain why to Farside when she asks me.  You know what's interesting?  She actually asked me, and engaged with me.  Shows me that she's interested in finding the truth.  Did KK ask me anything?  Nope, he just set about to deliberate distortions.  I gave my original answer to Farside in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4156687#p4156687\">Post 651</a> and she asked for clarification so I gave it in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4157137#p4157137\">Post 667</a>.  <br><br>And yes, I refuted points to his Slaxx case because I don't agree with several of his points.  But, rather than have a discussion with me about it he just throws up this crap.  I think some of his points were crappy, and I didn't refute every single one of his points.  I defend my townreads.  I've unfortunately had strong townreads on scum and worked really hard to keep them from getting lynched.  I will also point out crappy points being used against someone I'm suspicious of.  It's because I'm interested in finding answers not mislynching people.  KK is not.<br><br>If he was interested in the Slaxx issue, he would discuss it with me.  He's not.  Why not? <br><br>2.  He gets all bothered about my scum read on Junpei.  Yes, I weighed the fake dayvig gambit in, it's something that is one aspect that troubles me about the scum read.  I even mention that it might fit town meta in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4170136#p4170136\">Post 750</a>  But one gambit isn't going to make me think someone is definitely town when behavior suggests otherwise.  And, as I pointed out the behavior with regards to me felt like it came from scum not town.<br><br>3.  The point about me being scum for questioning RD.  Awful.  Absolutely awful AND speaks to him buddying confirmed town.  Why is it ridiculous for me to question the confirmed town of someone who claimed cop at L-1?  I dont' just take claims at face value.  So, I'm scum because I didn't know there was a bodyguard until it was mentioned?  I'm scum because I didn't know the balance of the game until Slaxx pointed out why it was most likely?  How is it scummy to try to figure out if someone everyone is saying is confirmed is actually confirmed.  Why is it scummy for me to try to determine if someone fake claimed?  And then in his next post he mocks me for not reading the mod post.  So I'm scum for not looking at the list of dead people and seeing what their roles are <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif\" alt=\":?\" title=\"Confused\"> Kay.<br><br>So, he buddies on this point and then tries to make me look bad for asking a LEGITIMATE question in an attempt to make sense of the game.<br><br>4.  Taking my sweet time is blatantly false.  THE NIGHT I replaced into the game, I read it and gave my thoughts.  He might not like my posting style or that I gave my thoughts as the game was progressing and gave my reads throughout, but I in no way shape or form took my sweet time to post my thoughts.  THE NIGHT AFTER I replace in, I read the three isos for who I had as my town reads and interacted with Junpei.  He says that I had to be vote prodded to finish the rest.  This looks objectively true because he did vote me on Wednesday when I hadn't hopped to it to finish the rest of my reads.  I was busy.  I said Sundays were busy for me.  Mondays are too.  I ran out of time to be able to play mafia on Tuesday, so wasn't able to get to it.  It's not like there was a flurry of activity that I was avoiding here or anything.  I started working on the rest on Wednesdays.  So what if I was only able to finish one a night for the next few nights.  They were my scum reads for one; of course I'm going to take longer to read them because I want to get them right.  Also, I have a damn job and other responsibilities.  Sometimes I run out of time.<br><br>HOW CAN I BE TAKING MY SWEET TIME AT ANYTHING???  Within one week of replacing into this game, I had read the game, gave my thoughts in a post, gave some preliminary reads, interacted with almost everyone, answered questions, reisoed everyone, gave a reads list, and re-read half the game.  He then said I fence sat on everyone.  Not true I have town reads, scum reads and a couple null reads.<br><br>His whole number four position on me is so completely false and demonstrates such a lack of really looking at my activity and what I've done that he should feel really bad about even writing that.<br><br>--------<br><br>His second case on me just gets worse.  He is deliberately trying to characterize me as someone who has hidden my thoughts in this game when I've been upfront about what I think from the start.  Yes, some of my reads were given before I read the game.  So?  What's wrong with that?  I got a basic working read on the two people that I interacted with when I entered the game.  Thought Slaxx seemed town and Junpei seemed scum.  I don't even know if I said Junpei was scum before I even started reading, so that might have just been part of my thought process from our conversation.<br><br>Seriously?  I'm scum for getting a couple of basic reads from interaction?  I'm scum for giving my impression of people as I was reading through the thread and then finishing my catch up post with the pool of who I thought the scum were?  Like, seriously, is this guy for real?  Is anyone actually buying this?  This makes me a friendly flaotie.  Whatever that is.  I'm not ready to just float with my reads. <br><br>He says this:<br><blockquote><div><cite>ScumKhan wrote:</cite>Some given before you read the game, some during, some after, some randomly, some when asked, etc. </div></blockquote><br><br>This is completely false.  Yes, I said I had a town read on Slaxx for something he said.  I gave my thoughts about the game and what I was thinking as I was reading, when no one else was around, said who I thought was in the pool of scum that very night.  My reads are there, clear and plain, I did this the night I replaced in.  No one had to ask me.  KK asked for a bulleted reads list, which I said I wanted to iso everyone to make sure of my thoughts.  That was the only thing asked for.  My reads were already out in the open.<br><br>This is such a blatant distortion of the events from the first night:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>scumkhan wrote:</cite>Your first interaction with Junpei was to ask him if he was scum in your first post after you claimed to have only read his post. So, no. You didn't read him as town for trying to read your slot. Meaning you treated him differently from Slaxx, right? So, why?</div></blockquote><br><br>Now, when he decides to insult my personality, he tells me not to be sarcastic, which would mean he read: <br><blockquote><div><cite>Tammy wrote:</cite>I was joking. I hadn't read a damn thing. I called Slaxx and you scum in that post...the two names I recognized. You thought it was serious? Like W.T.F???</div></blockquote><br><br>So, for him to characterize me as treating two people differently when I already explained the question he asked is distorting.  He's trying to make me look like I did something I didn't.  And is ignoring the very post in which I explained myself.  This is what I was referring to when I said he's ignoring the posts which answer the questions he has because HE DOESN'T CARE ABOUT THE ANSWERS.  HE ONLY CARES ABOUT GETTING SOMEONE MISLYNCHED.<br><br>Again, he ignores that this has already been answered:<br><blockquote><div><cite>scumkhan wrote:</cite>Since the vote-count immediately before your first post lists myself and Slaxx at 2 votes each, why do you predict a Slaxx flip of scum and not me?</div></blockquote><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Tammy wrote:</cite>I was joking. I hadn't read a damn thing. I called Slaxx and you scum in that post...the two names I recognized. You thought it was serious? Like W.T.F???</div></blockquote><br><br>Notice how he calls me friendly floatie again - That is direct provocation so that he can get a reaction to call me scum some more.<br><br>KK - You did not answer the question.  What is your read on Junpei and why.  Do not give me some weak bullshit answer like duh I'm calling you v. Junpei scum v. town as if that means anything.  It doesn't.  It does not give an answer for your read at all.  Do not beat around the bush with this.  You want answers from me.  You want to be a jerk and demand things from me, you can follow suit.  Your answer does absolutely nothing for me.  I'm town, so it does even less.<br><br>Look I can already tell from your demeanor, that you're going to win this.  I don't have the experience that you have to be able to defend myself in a way that you're not going to be able to twist to make me look bad.  But, here is the fact.  I will flip town.  I want your read on Junpei out in the open.  I want it now.  I want it based on evidence that is independent of me.  I also want your updated read on Psyche.  Both of the reads that you gave people were from when you replaced in.  What you linked me to is not good enough.  And, yes, this is me making demands of you.  You've gone out of your way to distort what I've done and said to make me look bad, I'm not going to tiptoe around you because you're making me look bad and trying to get me mislynched.<br><br>KK - As far as the read on Slaxx, I did give him a town read based on some things he said.  I am interested in what he says in his read on me because that should help me determine whether or not my initial read on him was correct.  He did give a main reason for why he thinks I'm town and that does actually follow with what I know of him and how his friend would read me.  <br><br>How would you in a million years think that that interaction was me asking permission to bus?  Like what?  This is you deliberately trying to make someone look bad.  Why wouldn't you ask me if you wanted to know what it meant?  IT'S BECAUSE YOU DON'T.  You're not interested in finding the truth.  You're interested in trying to distort a conversation or fill it with meaning that it doesn't have.  His lack of giving me a read is the only thing that gives me pause; however, he did give a read he just didn't say why.<br><br>Why wouldn't I want to make sure that a read I have of someone is correct?  I've had confirmation bias before on my town and scum reads, and I really try to make an effort to understand that I can be wrong, so I try to get answers the way I know how.  I know it might not make sense to you or anyone why I think that Slaxx's read on me will help me determine his thought process and alignment, and in the end it might not.  I think it might though, so we'll see.<br><br>Also everyone should note that he is now doing what he did yesterday.  He had this big scum read on Slaxx but voted for Fatcast because *reasons*, which left him able to push Slaxx today.  Now, he's got this one of Tammy-Slaxx is scum or one of Tammy-Junpei is scum.<br><br>Well isn't that just convenient.  So, when I flip town, he's got his next two potential mislynches lined up.  The only way they won't be is if Slaxx and Junpei are partners.  Good game scum."}

I realize that he would probably ask why for most votes, but after he wanted me to quickly vote KK when I replaced in I'm unsettled.<br><br>Actually, his urgency in getting KK voted (wasn't he urging Slaxx to to that just before I replaced in as well?) and my initial scum read on him makes me feel blech about sharing a wagon with him right now.<br><br>EXCEPT look at KK's most recent post.  He wants roflcopter to iso HIM and then give feedback on his cases on Slaxx and me.  When I'm town and I make a case on someone and I want someone's opinion on something, whether they just replaced in or not, I don't ask them to iso me and then give feedback on the case.  I ask them to iso the person, read my case and give feedback.  But, that's because as town I'm interested in an honest opinion.  I'm interested in them reading their iso and seeing if they see what I see or if I'm wrong in my assertions.  KK doesn't care.<br><br>Anyway after tomorrow, I'll be able to pick back up with my re-read of the thread and see if I can get a stronger opinion on Farside.<br><br>Still think scum will be found in Junpei/KK/Farside though."}

Do you really believe this or did you need extra points against Fatcat?  Town often ignore questions from scum.

If you really care about your case being accurate and others having an accurate view, you should be asking them to iso them and then your case, not you.  That's ridiculous to call that bullshit.  Cases are always written from the case writer's point of view, which means it's inherently biased.  It can't not be.  It's the same way that history books are not compiled of just facts, no matter how much historians try to peddle it so, because it's always written from someone's (usually the victor's) point of view.<br><br>Also, why if KK was a stronger scum read did you change to Farside before.  Why not stay on KK and push that case if it's stronger?</div></blockquote><br>1) The ideology which makes what Kublai Khan did bad is not exactly objectively correct. For instance the idea that you have to ISO X before reading a case on X in order to critique the case. I would argue that you don't need to do that.<br><br></div></blockquote><br><br>The order in which it is done is immaterial.  But reading a case without reading the material on which it is based is horrible.  It would be like reading a book review and then critiquing the book off the review without reading the book."}

For someone that hates misrepresentation, you are engaging in it pretty early and strongly in your rebuttal post. <br><br>I never said that you were scum for having a town read on Slaxx.

I've used this playstyle effectively for a while now.<br><br>Thank you for finally providing links I asked for a while back. Your strong-town still does not make sense to me. If a person commits 1 town-tell in the midst of 10 scum-tells, then the town-tell is irrelevent (unless overwhelmingly strong which I don't agree that your Slaxx town-tell is). If you are town, then that means that you noted a town-tell, then read the entire game with such a town-oriented confirmation bias towards Slaxx's behavior that I don't ever recall seeing a town player ever do that. Your certainty is too determined to be natural.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>And yes, I refuted points to his Slaxx case because I don't agree with several of his points.

I've unfortunately had strong townreads on scum and worked really hard to keep them from getting lynched. I will also point out crappy points being used against someone I'm suspicious of.

So the fact that you wanted to re-argue every point meant to me that you probably just wanted to increase the noise level of the game and make town apathetic by just re-hashing the same thing over and over.

How is it scummy to try to figure out if someone everyone is saying is confirmed is actually confirmed. Why is it scummy for me to try to determine if someone fake claimed? And then in his next post he mocks me for not reading the mod post. So I'm scum for not looking at the list of dead people and seeing what their roles are  Kay.</div></blockquote><br>Fucking yes.

I already explained this to Junpei when he thought that I went into the read with some strong confirmation bias that he was scum.  The things that I said should let you know I was trying to figure out Slaxx and if my initial impression was correct.  Which I come to at the end of my read through.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Tammy's response to Junpei's confirmation bias accusation wrote:</cite>In fact, if you were paying attention, I called Slaxx town last night upon replacing in from something he said.

How can I have an unnaturally strong town read on Slaxx and at the same time make it conditional???<br><br>This does not compute.  Your statement about my reads being conditional negate your statement that alludes to me going into the day with some confirmation bias that is unnatural.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>scumkhan wrote:</cite><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>And yes, I refuted points to his Slaxx case because I don't agree with several of his points. But, rather than have a discussion with me about it he just throws up this crap. I think some of his points were crappy, and I didn't refute every single one of his points. I defend my townreads. I've unfortunately had strong townreads on scum and worked really hard to keep them from getting lynched. I will also point out crappy points being used against someone I'm suspicious of. It's because I'm interested in finding answers not mislynching people. KK is not.</div></blockquote><br>I considered fighting with you point-by-point on my case, but 1) none of those were new and 2) I had argued every single one of those points in the pages prior. So the fact that you wanted to re-argue every point meant to me that you probably just wanted to increase the noise level of the game and make town apathetic by just re-hashing the same thing over and over. If you read the game then you read the reasoning behind all my arguments already. </div></blockquote><br><br>I'm a new person in the game who doesn't agree with the points you've made and you don't want to discuss any of them with me?

I don't agree with the points against Slaxx.  I don't find them scum tells so I didn't decide that one town tell negated a whole bunch of scum tells.  One - I don't think having to go back and re-read a game to give thoughts is a scum tell.  I have to do that in games I'm actually in.  Sometimes on a quick break from work I might follow a games happenings on my phone, but when I get home to give my thoughts I have to go back.  A friend of mine is playing in the Murder in the Louvre game.  I've been reading along.  If I were to have replaced into that game, I would have to go back and read because I wouldn't be able to give my thoughts from just me casually reading along.  Two - Reading and playing IS a different experience.  These are two of your major points that I think are absolute crap.  The others we could have discussed.  I don't know about the mass claim thing because I've only played in a few games that have mass claimed.  Like literally don't know much about the pros and cons. I gave you my view because I don't see what's so suspicious about it and could interpret it differently.<br><br>The only part of your case against Slaxx that I didn't totally negate was the bringing up of irrelevant meta or other games.  I said it felt thin.  But, it's the only thing that I thought had merit.  EVERYTHING else I thought was a stretch or not alignment indicative.<br><br>I didn't ignore a multitude of scum tells in favor of one town tell.  I thought one potential tell was suspicious and ignored it in favor of a few town tells and his behavior.  That's it.  It's different from my read on Junpei which was one possible town tell that was drowned out by what I thought was behavior indicative of scum.<br><br>See the difference?  Probably not becauese you're too intent on distorting my actions instead of trying to ascertain the truth.  Which is what scum do."}

He might have heard I'm an easy read, but that doesn't necessarily mean that I am.  And I was interested in what he would come back with.  If he came back with a strong town read for bullshit reasons that don't follow with how his friend thinks, as he said they typically think alike, or even a scum read for other bullshit reasons, it would make me re-evaluate him.  Recently, yes, he says he thinks I'm probably town.<br><br>That probably fits for how he should be thinking if he and his friend think alike; although his original reasoning for finding me town is strong and really good enough.  His friend <span style=\"font-style: italic\">can</span> read me really really well.  But his friend has seen me as scum and as town multiple times.  He's misread me as town because there are certain behaviors that are rather strong town tells of mine that he thought were suspicious the first time we were town together.  Since he knows my town play and he's seen me try to mimic my town play and react in ways that people who know me will test me on to figure out my alignment when they're unsure, I'm easy for him to read as he says that my scum and town play are near polar opposites.  I'm easy for a few people to read, but not everyone.  <br><br>What I wanted to see from Slaxx might not make sense to you, but it does to me.  I know why I'm an easy read to some people, but that shouldn't apply to Slaxx necessarily, so his reaction to me could have told me something based on that unless he was told what to look for.  (Now Slaxx has seen me as scum before, but only for a day and I'm pretty sure he had a light town read on me at one point so that might not even help with him knowing how to read me.)<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>scumkhan wrote:</cite>Stop lying.

I read with what Farside said in mind, but I don't see the issues with scumhunting that she pointed out.  And I still believe the points against him are very weak and don't read as scum tells.  One of the points that farside keeps bringing against him is the overreaction to pressure and votes.  I consider emotions to be town tells not scum tells so these points are meh.  Heh...Faraday, in describing how to read me, told a game recently to run a few votes on me and I flip the fuck out as town, most of the time.  It's something I have a hard time faking as scum.  People that know how to read me know I react strongly to votes and suspicion when town in a way that I don't when scum.  I'm actually trying to be less emotional as town so I don't get caught as easily as scum.  Fancy that.  So, for me this isn't a scum tell at all.<br><br>Again, I still think that if he were scum he would very easily be able to use the suspicion against me when I replaced in instead of saying he heard I was an easy read.  Upon replacing in I would have been a far easier person to try to get lynched if he was going survivalistic and trying to save himself, but he didn't.  Also, look at his reasons for not voting KK when they were waiting on a replacement.  That just doesn't sound like it comes from scum to me.<br><br>RainbowDash is still town.  Yes, now I understand that he has to be the town cop.  Geeze sorry for the paranoia, not realizing the bodyguard was there, and not being well-versed in issues of balance<br><br>roflcopter - Completely null.  Psyche did read as strong town on day one, but day two seemed like active lurking to me.  I like the gut town read on Slaxx, so that's good.  But, he hasn't been around long enough for me to evaluate him.  I don't like that he read KK's distorted case on me and isn't looking any further.  This is worrisome.<br><br>Still think scum will be found in Junpei/KK/Farside<br><br>Junpei - I'm less convinced of Junpei than when I replaced in.  The feeling that he's trying to direct the game is troubling.  It could be part of his personality, but sometimes scum feel like they are in more control and it comes out in the way they play.  I get a sense of that.  Many of my original issues still hold.  However, he's thrown me off by giving me a town read in the midst of this.  Scum are less likely to do this, so for him to take a step back from our original argument, reassess and say my thought process more likely comes from town isn't something that I would expect him to do as scum.  He could be joining the crusade against me with KK but he's not.  This has me hesitating and is shaking my previous read.<br><br>KK - Scum.  The only thing that makes me hesitate is how hard he's pushing me right now.  He would know this is going to be a mislynch if he makes it go through, but i don't know KK's style as I've never played with him before.  This could be his scum self.  For him to say the things he has, claim he's been objective (LULZ) while at the same time using rhetorical language that is false and designed to provoke a reaction and distort the things I've said and done and then refuse to listen to anything I say is really weird.  I can't see it coming from town though either.  Seriously look at the case on Slaxx.  Look at the case on me.  It's so full of shallow scum hunting and blatant misrepresentations of what has happened.  He's negated things said which answer his complaints all in the hopes of securing mislynches.  This is not town trying to make sure town wins; this is scum.<br><br>Farside - farside's play bothers me and I think it's likely that she is scum as well and would fit as KK's partner I think.  Farside spent the majority of day two declaring a Junpei/FC scum team.  That's pretty much all she talked about.  Then KK shows up and starts going after Slaxx.  All of a sudden Junpei isn't on the table anymore and everything is about Slaxx.  Her case on Slaxx is just as shallow as KK's and it's rather weird the way she dropped Junpei to go after Slaxx but today says that if it weren't for her suspicion of Slaxx and Psyche, then she'd go after Junpei.  Her attitude about Junpei is what makes me more concerned about Junpei and about her.  My concerns about them being a possible partner are probably the strongest thing that gives me doubt about KK being scum."}

He just seems more conscientious and conversational...like he's actually trying to solve the puzzle and not force pieces apart.  HOWEVER, some of his responses to MoI were such comic gold that I almost don't want to vote for him just because of that.  Also, since I'm the focus of his attacks here and I'm not there, I could be reading him wrong.  I'm not sure of anything at this point now."}

He's going to be at theoretical L-1 if there are no CCs anyway. <br><br>I still think that mass claim is a bad idea - especially if Deltabacon turns out to be town, there are so many possibilities of what else will be claimed that could fuck our cop.

Scum would know this, but if momentum is pushing that direction they would not fight it to much.  Junepi notes that its probably bad, but still pushes for a massclaim because it might work.  This is approximately the stance that I would expect scum to take in a \"its bad but if you insist\" approach that does nothing to stop it but takes the correct side of the coin looking back.<br><br>2) The whole FC thing.<br><br>The case on FC from Junepi was actually more or less my reasoning for FC-town.  Additonally I would have wanted a FC lynch badly as scum in this situation because if the RBer got lynched, that essentially confirmed FC as town due to all the mountainous talk.

I could really care less for the most part if somepony is in what I think is the right spot for the wrong reasons.  It seems like a really bizzare point to be pushing for.  Anything regarding investigations is also just pure WIFOM if nothing else, and for some reason this post occurs at the end of D1 before FC was lynched.  This just really really wreaks of trying to get the next days lynch lined up before the first one even occurs.</div></blockquote>"}

I know I don't agree with some points and Slaxx answered some of her questions fairly.  I have Slaxx as town, but as I told Farside yesterday in twilight, there were a couple things that were giving me pause and that I would look deeper into them.  There are aspects of his play that read town, but I also know that I tend to have an unnatural attachment to my town reads.  I'm liable to change a scum read on the basis of a post or two, but it takes a lot more to change a read from town to scum for me.  (I realized what a weakness this was for me in GvE when I spent days arguing with you all about BB, and even after he was counterclaimed wasn't convinced until he basically confessed.)<br><br>Anyway, we're in LyLo right?, so I'm going to take a look at everyone.  I still have Slaxx as most town to me, and there were things that KK said at the end of yesterday that had me reading a bit town, which would leave you and rofl.  However, KK is right that your reaction in twilight was a bit townie-ish, though I wish Rainbowdash would have said why it was a scum reaction, but that only leaves rofl, and all of you can't be town."}

Also, please excuse the stream-of-conciousness style nature of this post. LYLO is the time of the game where everything should be brought to the table. Since town has nothing but VTs, then that means all I can bring is my thoughts, unvarnished.<br><br>Now, I hate being in LYLO. I'm happy that I usually rarely get there since I start to get crippled by second guessing myself. Add to that, my two strongest scum-reads during the course of the game (Slaxx and Tammy) are still alive and are calling each other town. Which is the strongest position for scum to be in. If they are scum together, then by refusing to bus each other the pressure is on town to recognize each other's towniness. This is an effective strategy since if me, Junpei, and roflcopter are town, we are extremely fractured.<br><br>Of course, that's only one scenario, and an egotistical one at that. It would mean I haven't been wrong all course, just unconvincing. But it's a possible one.<br><br>The converse to that scenario is that I'm 100% wrong and the scum-team is Junpei and roflcopter. Which I have a hard-time seeing. First, Psyche's opening strategy was extremely town. I mean, I know it's possible for scum to fake such a gambit, but (and no offense meant) I just don't think that Psyche is experienced and skilled enough to have faked it as scum. Plus if he were scum and pulled off a successful early gambit that put him on everyone's town list, it's extremely unlikely that he would abandon the game. When you do something like that as scum, you stay in the game and see it through, if only for the bragging rights alone. So roflcopter isn't scum despite the fact that he's been really unimpressive since replacing back in.<br><br>Now Junpei... Junpei is the wildcard for me. If I'm wrong about one of {Slaxx, Tammy} then he's the scum partner. He's been tunnelled on me all game. Now I recognize that being wrong isn't a scumtell in itself, but as weird as this sounds he hasn't been too convincing about it. Lots of \"We should lynch Kublai Khan!\" yelling and \"look at that! he's scum!\" confirmation bias. But not much substance. I have to scroll way back in his iso to even find his case on me. And it's a pretty poor case considering ow much I've posted. Now, it's possible that he's just laziness, but laziness isn't a personality quirk that I would assign to Junpei. So scummy? Eh, a little. it's a weak point and the rest of his play has been pretty towny, so he remains a distant third suspect in my book.<br><br>So my thoughts remain with a Slaxx/Tammy scum-team. I'll start with Tammy. <br><br>First, this:<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4197776#p4197776\" class=\"postlink\">post 977</a>, Tammy wrote:</cite>Why not acknowledge it?  Even though it made sense due to balance and I told you that the team mafia thread discussion helped me understand and rid me of paranoia, there was still a little bit of doubt.  I was wrong to be paranoid; I was admitting I was wrong.</div></blockquote><br>This encapsulates a lot of my problem with your play. It doesn't address my question and just adds fluff and misdirection to the game. You didn't have admit that you were wrong. I mean, it's a given that you were wrong since before Rainbowdash even died. There's no oevrall town-benefit to admitting wrongness so...  uh, yeah. Plus there's zero reason to bring up Team Mafia as a source of paranoia since IIRC you were scum in TM. So where would the paranoia come from? <br><br>Actually that brings up the core reasoning behind why I think you're scum. When I read a game, I weigh an individual's play according to two categories: likely to come from town and likely to come from scum. Now mafia, by nature, is a game of paranoia. Every action has potential to have been committed by scum unless there is strong reason to think otherwise (see my read on Psyche/roflcopter, for example). So when someone is town, they need to actively commit town-tells to effective counter the paranoia of fellow town members.<br><br>Now I'm trying to take into account you're relative newness to the site/game, but it's not enough. You spammed the game from the onset. You reacted to pressure by OMGUSing and defended yourself by accusing me of \"misrepping you and trying to get mislynches\" which isn't a valid defense. If you are town, then the knowledge that you are a mislynch is known only to you and you'd know it's irrational to expect anyone to listen to you. So I can't figure out any town motivation for your defense, but I can figure scum motivation. <br><br>Slaxx.. Slaxx is just plain scum. I posted my case on Slaxx in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4154186#p4154186\">Post 568</a> and he never responded. Instead the game gets side-tracted by Tammy replacing in and Slaxx just lurked pretty hard the rest of the day  Also, I really don't like the fact that he'd acknowledge that farside22 is town, yet refuse to address her case at all. It's write more but I don't need to. Slaxx is scum because it's self-evident. <br><br>I'm tired now. and I have to dig more tomorrow. I'm announcing my strong intentions to vote Slaxx. Le'ts kick-start some conversation."}

I have no problem admitting I was wrong, and if you look at my original post it was clear I was acknowledging my embarrassment at being extremely wrong about something that was obvious to everyone else.  Also, I never said Team Mafia helped to instill my paranoia.  I've used Team Mafia twice - Slaxx and I played in a game together in which I replaced in as scum.  Him not using that to his advantage when I replaced in here is where I got my initial town read on Slaxx.  <br><br>The second time, where it relates to the RainbowDash situation was the Team Mafia results thread in which the balance of the game I played in was brought up.  It was following that discussion, in which in a 13 player game town had a back up role, a tracker, and a bodyguard.  Scum had a roleblocker.  In following the discussion on balance, I realized what everyone had already been saying -  that the bodyguard is there to protect the town role.  I then also remembered when GreyIce was asked why he didn't guard anyone night one, he said that the bodyguard exists to protect power roles.  That's when it clicked and made sense that there would be a cop if there was a bodyguard here.  It had nothing to do with the game itself or my alignment in the game, but the balance discussion which made things in this game more clear.<br><br>My paranoia was coming from someone who claimed town cop and L-1 and was being treated as confirmed town.

Awful. Absolutely awful AND speaks to him buddying confirmed town. Why is it ridiculous for me to question the confirmed town of someone who claimed cop at L-1? I dont' just take claims at face value. So, I'm scum because I didn't know there was a bodyguard until it was mentioned? I'm scum because I didn't know the balance of the game until Slaxx pointed out why it was most likely? How is it scummy to try to figure out if someone everyone is saying is confirmed is actually confirmed. Why is it scummy for me to try to determine if someone fake claimed? And then in his next post he mocks me for not reading the mod post. So I'm scum for not looking at the list of dead people and seeing what their roles are  Kay.<br><br>So, he buddies on this point and then tries to make me look bad for asking a LEGITIMATE question in an attempt to make sense of the game.</div></blockquote><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Tammy wrote:</cite>How hard is it to grasp that I DIDN'T REALIZE THERE WAS A BODYGUARD UNTIL IT WAS POINTED OUT TO ME?????????<br><br>I understand now. In fact, I'll let you in on a little secret. I didn't give up my paranoia on this issue until yesterday. Why? Because I've been following this discussion here: viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;t=22615&amp;p=4179085#p4179085 which has to do with the balance of the CN game. Yesterday is when I remembered that we had a bodyguard in that game to protect the tracker. That is when it clicked and all made sense that of course we would have a cop (or something) if we have a bodyguard, and it would make sense for there to be a roleblocker too.<br><br>I suck at issues of balance. Literally suck at it. I have to have things about roles and issues explained to me almost every game, and I've never played in a 9-player game before.

I'm sick and tired of scum trying to make me feel stupid for not understanding things when I'm trying to understand how things work.<br></div></blockquote><br><br>If you have not been able to get from that exchange that I don't have a firm grasp of issues of balance, then I don't know what to tell you.  Sure, maybe it would make sense to YOU for there to be a cop without a bodyguard, but it didn't make sense to me.  Maybe after I've been playing this game for five years, this will be something familiar to me.

In the scum QT I actually worried a great deal that you may have been a bomb or PGO or something (blame zoraster and his reflexive roles for that paranoia) because you gained nothing by exposing town PRs."}

Please understand that I only did it because I was aiming to win. I've noticed that people with your stream-of-consciousness style tend to read really town, but they can be compromised if you upset and irritate them. Thus it makes any case they put up against me look like emotion-based reaction rather then a good case. And I think I pulled it off this game. I honestly thought that Slaxx was more lynchable because of the weird tracker worry.
