I do that to, but I typically do it by PoE: Knock out who I think is town, due partner exclusions, then choose the lynch from there.

I'm pretty sure 1,2,3,4 are all town.

I can confidently say:<br>\n<br>\n6's only possible partner is 7. Therefore, if my reads are correct, there's 0-1 scum between (6,7) and 1-2 between (8,9)<br>\n<br>\nThen Id list out all the different combinations and see which pairings were most likely. Thats what I meant by partner exclusions earlier.

Nothing I can do about your misunderstanding my tone.  I came off Psyche for the exact reasons stated.  He showed a willingness to be involved and explained the purpose of his first post.  Since I was mistaken about his intent, I unvoted.  I voted your for the reason stated.  Your first post looked suspicious.  <br>\n<br>\n2.  This has been answered.  You can elect to ignore the explanation.  Their behaviors were not the same thing, in my view.<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>DLG wrote:</cite>The post Deltabacon replied to contained FatCat's vote on Psyche. This was the second vote, and was clearly not RVS.<br>\n<br>\nMy conclusion is that Deltabacon would have seen this and chose to only reply to the out of game thing.<br>\n<br>\nMy conclusion regarding Ellibereth is that he replied to an in game thing.<br>\n<br>\nIt's not a huge disparity, but enough for me to differentiate between them.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\n3.  I really don't get what you're saying.  My comment to you from Post #12 was valid, at the time it was made.  Psyche wasn't scumhunting in a form I recognized.  I was correcting a portion of the question you posed to Psyche, to illustrate my problems with his first posts.<br>\n<br>\n4.  I don't think saying someone is right-brained is an insult.  Why do you?  <br>\n<br>\nWorse (from your logical point-of-view), your conclusion from the exchange is utterly illogical.<br>\n<br>\nThe premise was that I was not being logical in this game, therefore, I was scummy.  I agreed that I was not being logical.  I said to take a look at my past games to see that I can be logical.  Most of my past games are me as Town, like everyone else.  So, I was pointing out how my play is different in this game versus my past games.  To illustrate to FatCat how erroneous he was in basing a judgement of my mind on the posts from this game.<br>\n<br>\nAnd, you conclude that I was trying to point to my past games to show how closely I was matching my Town meta in this game?  How did you arrive at your conclusion?<br>\n<br>\nWhat good point did I dodge?  The one about disengage/re-engage?  Again, this has been explained.  After I said disengage, FatCat went scummy in a new and exciting fashion.  I re-engaged on those grounds.  His point was faulty, and supported by evidence that deliberately was missing a crucial piece.  You've since tried to make this seem like a great point.  It was bunk, then and now.<br>\n<br>\n5.  At 77, I wanted to illustrate a facet of FatCat's scumminess that he had only shown after 65.

It's even weaker than flailing. In fact, my studies may even end up suggesting that OMGUSing is a towntell since scum are so loath to do it. Doing it over and over again doesn't change this. All OMGUS is, is bad play.&#160;<br>\n<br>\nAlso, when people say \"yo\", they're either being hipsters or deliberately silly (i.e., joking). 215 can't be taken seriously due to its wording and context.<br>\n<br>\nFatCat's a VI. VI is a rude term, but that's the perfect term. The ways he decides to attack and defend himself just read like inexperienced town. There's some good theory on this that I read in the MD forum...I'll bring it up if ncessary. But repeatedly engaging in bad play without engaging in circumspection, assertively pushing positions with fundamentally problematic assumptions about what counts as scumplay, and a general ignorance about scummy behavior and that he should avoid it &#8212;<br>\n<br>\nIt all suggests that he's VI.

It's even weaker than flailing. In fact, my studies may even end up suggesting that OMGUSing is a towntell since scum are so loath to do it. Doing it over and over again doesn't change this. All OMGUS is, is bad play.&#160;<br>\n<br>\nAlso, when people say \"yo\", they're either being hipsters or deliberately silly (i.e., joking). 215 can't be taken seriously due to its wording and context.<br>\n<br>\nFatCat's a VI. VI is a rude term, but that's the perfect term. The ways he decides to attack and defend himself just read like inexperienced town. There's some good theory on this that I read in the MD forum...I'll bring it up if ncessary. But repeatedly engaging in bad play without engaging in circumspection, assertively pushing positions with fundamentally problematic assumptions about what counts as scumplay, and a general ignorance about scummy behavior and that he should avoid it &#8212;<br>\n<br>\nIt all suggests that he's VI. And town.&#160;<br>\n<br>\nI need to check farside's meta and see if her opinion of OMGUS is as high as she demonstrates in this attack.

{"number": 384, "id": "4137861", "user": "DLG", "user_id": "14600", "content": "Alright.<br>\n<br>\nSo, the Iknal disappearance is bothersome.  If the set of {me, FatCat, Junpei, farside22} is all Town, this is just about a perfect Day for scum!Iknal and partner.  Between knowing I'm Town, and my reads on Junpei and farside22, this idea is not far-fetched.<br>\n<br>\nI'm still very much in favor of the FatCat lynch.  I don't believe anything he's posted is inconsistent with him getting a scum role PM.  This is taking into account what I believe was unvarnished truth, here.<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>FatCat wrote:</cite><br>\nDon't be perplexed. I haven't been been putting in great effort since day 1 or 2. This is my first game and I had no idea these games were taken so seriously or went on for so long, I will happily say I am the village idiot.<br>\n<br>\nThat being said, I made a commitment to Amrun when I started this game that I wouldn't flake, so I am happy to see the game through to the end. I'm not going to put in the same levels of research or be as meticulous in what I say as Junpei, Psyche or Slaxx are. If the town went to lynch me, that's fine, I'm not the most useful poster in this thread (although it would be a misslynch). This will be my first and last game on this site, this site isn't really for me.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nIf FatCat flips Town, I'd investigate Iknal.  If FatCat flips scum, I'd investigate Psyche.  Will explain this below.<br>\n<br>\nI don't see any difference in tone or intent in Junpei's push on farside22 as compared to his push on me.  Both seem designed to pressure what he believes are scum.  I don't think he's wrong to think that farside22 was contradicting her stated stance with respect to the viability of OMGUS as a tell.  The basic problem I see with how farside22 went about things is that she didn't differentiate that FatCat's OMGUS was done in a scummy fashion as compared to how Town would OMGUS.  In her push against FatCat, it was just \"look at the OMGUS, lynch him\".  That indicates a belief that OMGUS is a scum-tell.  I acknowldege that there was much more to the case, but this is specifically commenting on how she presented just this portion of the case.  That makes Junpei's push justified.<br>\n<br>\nFrom farside22's point-of-view, though, I don't think she was contradicting herself.  I can see how FatCat's posts can be read as scum OMGUS.  Since it seems that this was the primary way she digested and processed FatCat's posts/votes, it's not contrary to her belief that OMGUS (as a stand alone behavior) is null.  From the perspective of wanting to push for a lynch on a scum read, using the commonly accepted vernacular to get her point across is acceptable.  The burden of showing how FatCat's particular OMGUS behavior was scummy (to separate from her stance from another thread) wouldn't occur to her, unless she was overly conscious of making sure to not violate her \"meta\".<br>\n<br>\nTL;DR re: Junpei v farside22<br>\nTown v Town<br>\n<br>\nThe push against farside22 was precipitated by Psyche's case.  At face value, it looks Town motivated.  It shows investment in discovering and lynching scum.  I'm uncertain as to how he came away from the validity of it.<br>\n<br>\nThis brings me to why I'd look at Psyche if FatCat flips scum.  The timing of Psyche's case coincided with growing FatCat dislike.  Also, the disparaging defense of FatCat bugs me.  I can see a scum motivation behind saying, \"pay no attention to that guy, he's really just a VI.\"  It serves to place his hypothetical partner in a fairly safe position.  The push which generated the counter-wagon of farside22 is self-explanatory as a scum move.<br>\n<br>\nThis theory is not fool-proof.  But, if FatCat does flip scum, I would definitely want it ruled out via investigation.<br>\n<br>\nI'm willing to believe both Deltabacon and Ellibereth unless and until game events prove otherwise.  Of the two, I think Ellibereth's is more believable.  It fully explains his push for a mass-claim and confirms him as Town except in la-la land.  I always have some disbelief of a Cop claim generated by being put to L-1, but meh.  For some out-guess the Mod thoughts, why put a Cop in a game advertised as being for players who want to concentrate on scum-hunting?  Probably paranoia talking, but it still itches at the back of my head.<br>\n<br>\nSlaxx, I'm absolutely null on.  His impact on the game appears inoffensive, for lack of a better word.  This bugs me at a paranoia level, but I certainly don't consider him a scum read.", "time": "Thu Jun 21, 2012 2:20 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=22361&start=375", "forum": "53", "thread": "22361"}

It would be a hard decision for me because Psych is definitely a pretty confident town read.

Reading the game when you aren't in it and trying to find scum is a completely different experience than getting a role PM and knowing:<br>\n1. What you do now has impact on the game (rereading the game thoroughly and dedicating an appropriate amount of time to scumhunting, which of course is more than a person not playing, and of course is best accomplished by rereading and combing through the thread)<br>\n2. You are responsible for your actions and opinions (once again, now that you are playing an active and influential part in the game, you want to make sure youre confident in reads)<br>\n3. You have to communicate your thoughts (the most important: you need to have specific evidence from the thread, quotes, post numbers, etc, which is of course best accomplished by rereading. How else am I supposed to consicely and effectively communicate my opinions? \"Oh in that one post around page 3\" or \"Post 62\"...Obviously second.

KK's first point it literally \"He reread the thread after role PM, this makes him scum\" when I think its pretty obvious this is a null tell: the best way to do a catchup post is to have the thread ready and on hand and go through and comment on things. This isn't something I should have to explain.<br>\n<br>\n-Yeah, look back at the game we played where you were scum and I was town.

Also, I don't know if its anywhere ON the site, but Reg and I agree a lot that the best time to claim is after a Scum roleblocker flip if there is one. In this case, a single scum PR flip would be enough for me to advocate it the next day.<br>\n<br>\n-And yeah, my posts ARE scumhunting, I've explained how I scumhunt and you know how I do it Kahn, I did a similiar thing in your game. Look at it from my point of view: There 2 clears, possibly a third tomorrow, and I have two strong town reads. I don't have to find scum, I literally have an extra lynch if a town read is wrong, or if something fucks with the cop. Literally all I have to do is see if anyone doesn't fit with anyone else and then use PoE to find the best lynch. Why try to find the two scum in the group of four, which by the way I'm terrible at and have already explained that, and instead just PoE the fuck out of the game by excluding partners?

You claimed VT on Page 34 (Day 2) and after you were virtually confirmed as town (from the RisingPhoenix lynch).

There is so much red tape and aggravation involved in trying to justify that sort of radical change that most people just say \"He went from scum to null\". <br>\n<br>\nChoosing a lynch based on PoE relieves you of the guilt of making a bad case.

I don't see it in either situation, but way less so in his case if that's what you're insinuating.<br>\n<br>\nWhen I replaced in he claimed that my predecessor had soft claimed a protective role.  That shows suspicion on my slot in an attempt to get me to lie if I were scum trying to save myself.<br>\n<br>\nHe didn't change his read either.  He said he heard I'm easy to read.  He then said if he's lynched to read me and go from there on PoE.  Besides, saying I'm an easy read could also be a bit of a reaction test.  If I think he knows how to read me, and if I'm scum, I might get thrown off balance.   He hasn't given his read of me yet.  When he does, I'll be able to go from there.

Tammy - everything you have posted in regards to my suspicion has read post-decision. You read through the game and found reasons to call me scum, even when you hadn't explained why you felt I was scum in the first place. I say this because the posts you pointed out calling me scum not only are few in number, but also are erroneous. It looked like you aren't reading my posts carefully, rather reading them from a mindset that is 100% expecting me to say something suspicious.<br>\n<br>\nI'd like evidence that suggests I am more interested in making people look suspicious so I can mislynch them if you got it, seeing as every other point you've made has been exhausted.<br>\n<br>\npedit: Really rainbowdash (can I just call you Llama?)...

Oh Junpei.<br>\n<br>\n2.  That I seemed to make a different stance?  Telling someone not to claim as vanilla for no reason and unprompted on day one of a 26 player game because it's stupid is different than claiming vanilla upon replacing in when there are 7 players and having been asked to claim.  The fact that you went to that game, found that quote, and tried to compare the two is part of where your behavior is suspicious.  You tried to find a contradiction to make me look bad when the situations couldn't be more different.<br>\n<br>\n3.  It's okay.  I'm part emotional player...it results in emotional posts from time to time.<br>\n<br>\n4.  Junpei - When you read someone everything you read is made post-decision.  I don't get your point.  Yes, I was leaning scum on you from your behavior upon replacing in and none of your behavior changed that read as I read the game.  Don't tell me how I operate.  This is making you look even scummier Junpei.  I didn't read through the game with some preconceived notion that you were scum and therefore looked for reasons to validate what I thought.  That's a ridiculous notion, and fits with scummy behavior.  In fact, you have experience with me Junpei; you know that I'm not fixed in my reads.  You've seen me change my mind enough to know that I don't hunt for reasons to find people scum without reason.<br>\n<br>\nIn fact, if you were paying attention, I called Slaxx town last night upon replacing in from something he said.  Then in my reads I twice said that I didn't know what to make of his alignment because I have trouble reading him.  That should tell you that I didn't start reading with biases in place.<br>\n<br>\nWhy did you get so worried that in my first post upon replacing in I called you scum?  There was absolutely no way I could have a scum read on you, so for you to get all upset about it and want an answer makes you look really suspicious.

If I'm right about the person who it is, it's someone who can read me really really well.  I replaced into a scum slot in that game.  If he was scum, why go for the \"I heard she was an easy read\" why not mention me being scum in the game we previously played together?  Especially since it's under similar circumstances - me replacing into a game that has some suspicion already.

I'm pretty sure that I said faking a read is extremely easy to do.  I also said I'm interested in what he comes back with.

{"number": 682, "id": "4157414", "user": "Tammy", "user_id": "18197", "content": "Why yes, Mr. Junpei, I do assert that your methods of scumhunting are lacking any type of town mindset and are therefore indicative of scum pretending to hunt rather than town trying to find mafia.<br>\n<br>\nI assure you that I do humbly regret that you find my tone and attitude in this game to be distasteful.  I find your facts about my posting history interesting.  Certainly, I have posted more than normal levels in the past 25 hours, but it does take some posts to interact with people and as I have time today, well that&#8217;s going to happen.  If you think I&#8217;m going to have this many posts every day, well you can rest your little head that I won&#8217;t.  <br>\n<br>\nIt is of interest to note that those snide comments as you demonstrate came after a post made by you in which you alluded to me making an appeal to emotion and a faulty implication.  If you don&#8217;t like snide comments, one would think that you wouldn&#8217;t take such a haughty tone when addressing others.  I suppose maybe you don&#8217;t realize that you constantly take a condescending tone with whomever you are speaking, but alas this is the truth.<br>\n<br>\nI deeply regret that you hate that I won&#8217;t stop talking, but you might note that I am speaking in response to being spoken to just like an honorable young woman does, with the exception of my spamming of the night before.  I am likewise filled with sorrow that you believe I am not being serious in my thoughts or communications.  I&#8217;m quite certain that, with the exception of my catch up posts, my thoughts have not been too stream of conscious and have contained my rather serious opinions on this game.  I do utterly believe that it is suspicious that you keep dismissing my thoughts and opinions.<br>\n<br>\nI also apologize that I haven&#8217;t backed up my buzzphrase use, but honestly am at a loss about what you are speaking.  If you could fill me in on the buzzphrase in question, I would be happy to either back it up or accept my mistake in using something I am clearly too mentally deficient to use properly.<br>\n<br>\nI can assure you that I won&#8217;t get over my belief in how scum hunt.  I did assert that I am aware that town hunt this way too at times, but you might also want to care at least a little bit.  If, after I iso you, I still believe that you are scum as I read last night, I will present a case and push for your lynch.  It&#8217;s the rarest of occasions that I am unable to get someone lynched when I truly believe in their lack of innocence.  But, like I said, I haven&#8217;t iso&#8217;d you yet and since I am a seven year old with a raging case of ADHD, I am liable to change my opinions on people at a moment&#8217;s notice.  However, the way you&#8217;ve devolved into attacking my person for next to no reason at all doesn&#8217;t give me hope that my opinion of your alignment is going to change.<br>\n<br>\nI again humbly apologize for misrepresenting your mental faculties.  You see, I have this problem wherein I believe that other people have memories that work as well as mine, and since I remember your play quite well considering the game we played in together wasn&#8217;t too long ago, I apparently mistook your ability to remember.  This was especially so considering how quickly you realized my vanilla stance was incompatible with previous stances.  I, however, am completely swayed by your assertion that your memory is, in fact, deficient because you claim to remember me as a calm person.  Anyone who has played a mafia game with me would be woeful at making such a claim with a straight face.  However, I am filled with intrigue over your assertion that you barely remember my play, yet you stated that you remembered emotion that was irritating.  Junpei, this appears to be a contradiction in your memories or at least your claims of memories.  Either you remember me as calm or you remember me as emotional, or you barely remember me at all.  According to you contradictions are scum tells, so will you just go ahead and agree with me now that you are scum?<br>\n<br>\nI am uncertain what your point is about your favorite author.  No, I was unaware that your favorite author is someone I have never heard of.  It hardly matters to the situation, but as long as we are sharing, my favorite author is Homer and my favorite book is the Iliad.<br>\n<br>\nI am overjoyed that you are going to resist stooping to my level.  I look forward to the day when I can stop personally insulting you for no reason as well.

Those are seeming contradictions, no?  But, they're not; they are me...you are remembering correctly.  They are contradictions and they are correct, so not all contradictions are indicative of scum because they can be contained in one alignment/person.  (Btw...I wasn't emotional when you asked me to get some sleep before answering a question.  I literally hadn't slept for weeks and my coherence was near gone.  You told me I wasn't making sense, I agreed it was possible because I was so tired, you agreed to wait for me to answer your question until I could get some sleep and make sense.)<br>\n<br>\nOkay fine, you remember sweeping personalities.  I don't get worried easily.  I get emotional easily but not worried or nervous.<br>\n<br>\nI'm not trying to flex win ratios...you said you weren't worried and no one would buy my crap.  I'm just pointing out that it's flawed.<br>\n<br>\n-------<br>\n<br>\nStill interested in Slaxx's read on me.  Whether it's town or scum...looking forward to the reasons.  Yes, I know that I said earlier that not having reasons means town, but this is important to me and how I'll be able to read Slaxx.<br>\n<br>\nPsyche - Like his early aggressiveness.  He disappears though in day two.  I don't know what to make of that.  Gonna put him as a light town though for now though.  I want to read back through his iso though, there's something nagging me that I can't quite put my finger on.  It could be that it looks like he's active lurking though.<br>\n<br>\nRainbowdash - Town, right?  Do I need to really ISO?  If he's the cop though, why didn't he die last night?<br>\n<br>\nSlaxx - I didn't even have to get through half his iso to confirm my town read on him.  Like I really don't see the points against him at all.  Slaxx, though, I really really need for you to tell me when and how you changed your read on Junpei.  He's your strongest town read now, but he wasn't on day one.  I remember from  the game we played together that you said you were susceptible to buddying by scum.  I'll have to read to see if Junpei employed that method - though I'm guessing not since Farside has accused you of buddying Junpei - but still.  I'd like to know that read.  The only thing that causes me some concern is that there was no vote at the end of yesterday.  And the only reason why it causes me concern is because typically scum partners try not to be on the same lynches, and he's the only person not on the day one lynch.  But, it's not that big of a deal as that isnt' an exact sicence anyway.  Slaxx town hunts and scum hunts through PoE.  I hate that type of scumhunting, but it's how some people do it and I'm not going to criticize over much, especially considering that Junpei is making light of how I scum hunt.  But, because he scumhunts this way I don't follow the criticism against him.  Like seriously, if he turns out not being town I'll be pretty surprised.  Although, his read on me should really help me determine his alignment so...<br>\n<br>\nAll right that's it for tonight.  I'm tired.

If we hit the goon today I would be happy calling her town.<br>\n2) I think Slaxx is the best bet for scum here.  I will try and explain this later on, but its the simplest conclusion I keep arriving at because<br>\n3) I almost think the Junepi-Tammy thing is not TvT.  Its not really be pushed on by anypony but maybe Slaxx again, and it more seems to be a distraction from what has been going on.<br>\n4) DGL-Tammy are a tale of two players, I really disliked DGL but sorta like Tammy play.  I would hold that lynch on similar grounds as Junepi at this point.  I do think Tammy would have read a scum QT that should have pointed out me-cop, but at the same time snap claim is a little iffy.  I guess I would vote Junepi over her at this point but not by much.<br>\n<br>\nThe play of Slaxx really doesnt seem like town around the massclaim scenario though.  If you at all thought there was going to be a non-investigation power (GF/RB) then it was a bad idea to claim at that juncture in the game.  Slaxx saying he \"hoped it was RC\" when I think he unprompted brought up RBer again at some point just rings like scum who know that a massclaim in this small of a setup should give them the upperhand.  Basic rule of hoof, the smaller the setup the more a D1 massclaim benifits scum, the bigger it gets the more roles there tend to be for scum to have to deal with so more town power to draw off of that can be used.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote Slaxx</div><br>\n<br>\nProbably with one of Tammy/Junepi<br>\nI would put a lynch tier something like..<br>\n<br>\nSlaxx<br>\nTammy/Junepi<br>\nPsyche<br>\nKK/Farside", "time": "Sun Jul 01, 2012 2:18 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=22361&start=675", "forum": "53", "thread": "22361"}

At least the hardcore emotional knee jerk.  I think American Gods (which we should have won because if nopony realizes a VC error for almost a week is should stand) is a good example of this being more of a town farside move.  If she is scum she has to be goon, as RBer esentially would be game throwing by making that move and farside is smart enough not to do that I think.<br>\n<br>\nSo in a sense the offchance of hitting a goon today makes me want to keep her alive, even though as im typing this I fell into a similar trap to postpone a scum lynch in a different game is nagging at me.

Given that FC appeared to be town before this to Junepi, im going to just call this the BS case push on town to get the mislynch.<br>\n<br>\n3) This one post on KK which just really bugs me for the bolded line<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4141900#p4141900\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4141900#p4141900\" data-post-id=\"4141900\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 453</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=16276\">Junpei</a> wrote:</cite>Also looking over Kublai Khan's catch up post, here's a summary:<br>\n<br>\nMass claim rant<br>\nReally poor town/scum reads (<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">not attacking accuracy, rather quality</div>)<br>\nUnexplained investigation purposals<br>\n<br>\nKublai Khan: How did Slaxx get ahead of the story?<br>\n<br>\nThis Slaxx case by the way is a work of bad. <br>\n<br>\nBump Kublai Khan to the definite top of my \"cop investigate please\" list and add him to my scummy list.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nI dont get how \"accuracy isnt the problem\" can be a scumtell.

However, I also recognized that I was the only one who felt that way. Instead of grinding on a chalkboard and being the only one to not claim, I decided to go with it and try to keep order (see: me telling DLG to claim next and then I think it was Slaxx who did what I was trying to prevent and  broke the chain) to make it at least efficient. Also, as I was reading my notes on Farside, I came across a post where it is said that Farside did not mention claiming prior to doing so herself. Anything to say about that?<br>\n<br>\n2) So you think that because I (and everyone else in the game besides you) thought that FatCat was very suspicious for reasons that you thought he was town that I am scum (this isn't your only reason but it is a factor)? I think it's more likely that you are suffering from retrospect syndrome. Did you know FatCat was town before you started reading through the pages?<br>\n<br>\n3)What? I meant that the quality of Kublai Khans reads were poor.

Oh and the fake day vig...which I'm going to have to nod my head in the direction of Rainbowdash that this does sort of fit town meta I suppose, meh.  It's still stupid and should stop.<br>\n<br>\nSeriously, if anyone wants to see a serious disconnect look at the way Junpei reacts to me upon arrival.  Demands that I claim, I claim, he asks why I claimed, tells me that my saying I don't care about claiming vanilla is awful, within four minutes finds a post I made in which I told someone in another game claiming vanilla was stupid, interprets it badly, appeals to buzzword which he's already claimed are used by scum, claims I was a much more careful player in GvE, wants to know why I attacked him by asking him if he was scum upon replacing in, remembers that I post long, detailed posts, then claims he barely remembers me at all.  Um <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":?\" title=\"Confused\"> contradiction.<br>\n<br>\nSeriously, everything about his reaction to me upon replacing in feels like scum caught for the wrong reasons.  In my first post, which came after his stupid fake day vig post, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4155589#p4155589\">Post 579</a> I make a joke about not wanting to read 24 pages to find out that Slaxx is scum and I ASK Junpei if he's scum.  I don't attack him; I don't say he's scum.  I simply say \"are you scum?\"  Not long later, he asks why I attacked him.  That post in question is the first post that I made; I made it clear that I hadn't posted anything.  The natural reaction might be to answer the question or ignore it as it's obvious that I couldn't possibly think anyone was scum at that point.  I literally called Slaxx scum in that post and he didn't react at all, but Junpei got all \"Why are you attacking me?\"<br>\n<br>\nNot only does this response not make sense from a typical town perspective but it also doesn't make sense from the perspective of someone who had just attempted to gain a response from a stupid fake day vig.  It does make sense, however, from scum who are overly concerned about what people think about them.<br>\n<br>\nAnyway there just isn't much that feels natural or genuine in Junpei's iso.  He's brought up GvE and he was much more natural there.  There was a whole lot that felt really genuine from him, like he was trying to figure things out.  I remember near then end when people thought he might be scum.  I got a little paranoid but still didn't want to believe it because of how genuine he felt throughout the game.

{"number": 787, "id": "4173801", "user": "Tammy", "user_id": "18197", "content": "Yes, Junpei.  Pretty much all of it.  Have you ever heard of the notion that cases do more to help town evaluate the person who makes the case more than on whom the case is being made?  KK's crap case pretty much does exactly that and his whole demeanor towards me is indicative of scum distorting every single action and reaction as something indicative of scum rather than town.  And the fact that RD has me as the second likeliest person he would vote today and is calling KK town just demonstrates that he's probably going to get it to work.  And good game scum.  You've snowed town.<br>\n<br>\nI've had crap cases written on me by town before, but you can usually tell when they're genuine.  The type of case he's written on me is the type I've only ever seen scum do.<br>\n<br>\n1.  Apparently I'm scum for having a town read on Slaxx.  I explain why to Farside when she asks me.  You know what's interesting?  She actually asked me, and engaged with me.  Shows me that she's interested in finding the truth.  Did KK ask me anything?  Nope, he just set about to deliberate distortions.  I gave my original answer to Farside in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4156687#p4156687\">Post 651</a> and she asked for clarification so I gave it in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4157137#p4157137\">Post 667</a>.  <br>\n<br>\nAnd yes, I refuted points to his Slaxx case because I don't agree with several of his points.  But, rather than have a discussion with me about it he just throws up this crap.  I think some of his points were crappy, and I didn't refute every single one of his points.  I defend my townreads.  I've unfortunately had strong townreads on scum and worked really hard to keep them from getting lynched.  I will also point out crappy points being used against someone I'm suspicious of.  It's because I'm interested in finding answers not mislynching people.  KK is not.<br>\n<br>\nIf he was interested in the Slaxx issue, he would discuss it with me.  He's not.  Why not? <br>\n<br>\n2.  He gets all bothered about my scum read on Junpei.  Yes, I weighed the fake dayvig gambit in, it's something that is one aspect that troubles me about the scum read.  I even mention that it might fit town meta in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4170136#p4170136\">Post 750</a>  But one gambit isn't going to make me think someone is definitely town when behavior suggests otherwise.  And, as I pointed out the behavior with regards to me felt like it came from scum not town.<br>\n<br>\n3.  The point about me being scum for questioning RD.  Awful.  Absolutely awful AND speaks to him buddying confirmed town.  Why is it ridiculous for me to question the confirmed town of someone who claimed cop at L-1?  I dont' just take claims at face value.  So, I'm scum because I didn't know there was a bodyguard until it was mentioned?  I'm scum because I didn't know the balance of the game until Slaxx pointed out why it was most likely?  How is it scummy to try to figure out if someone everyone is saying is confirmed is actually confirmed.  Why is it scummy for me to try to determine if someone fake claimed?  And then in his next post he mocks me for not reading the mod post.  So I'm scum for not looking at the list of dead people and seeing what their roles are <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":?\" title=\"Confused\"> Kay.<br>\n<br>\nSo, he buddies on this point and then tries to make me look bad for asking a LEGITIMATE question in an attempt to make sense of the game.<br>\n<br>\n4.  Taking my sweet time is blatantly false.  THE NIGHT I replaced into the game, I read it and gave my thoughts.  He might not like my posting style or that I gave my thoughts as the game was progressing and gave my reads throughout, but I in no way shape or form took my sweet time to post my thoughts.  THE NIGHT AFTER I replace in, I read the three isos for who I had as my town reads and interacted with Junpei.  He says that I had to be vote prodded to finish the rest.  This looks objectively true because he did vote me on Wednesday when I hadn't hopped to it to finish the rest of my reads.  I was busy.  I said Sundays were busy for me.  Mondays are too.  I ran out of time to be able to play mafia on Tuesday, so wasn't able to get to it.  It's not like there was a flurry of activity that I was avoiding here or anything.  I started working on the rest on Wednesdays.  So what if I was only able to finish one a night for the next few nights.  They were my scum reads for one; of course I'm going to take longer to read them because I want to get them right.  Also, I have a damn job and other responsibilities.  Sometimes I run out of time.<br>\n<br>\nHOW CAN I BE TAKING MY SWEET TIME AT ANYTHING???  Within one week of replacing into this game, I had read the game, gave my thoughts in a post, gave some preliminary reads, interacted with almost everyone, answered questions, reisoed everyone, gave a reads list, and re-read half the game.  He then said I fence sat on everyone.  Not true I have town reads, scum reads and a couple null reads.<br>\n<br>\nHis whole number four position on me is so completely false and demonstrates such a lack of really looking at my activity and what I've done that he should feel really bad about even writing that.<br>\n<br>\n--------<br>\n<br>\nHis second case on me just gets worse.  He is deliberately trying to characterize me as someone who has hidden my thoughts in this game when I've been upfront about what I think from the start.  Yes, some of my reads were given before I read the game.  So?  What's wrong with that?  I got a basic working read on the two people that I interacted with when I entered the game.  Thought Slaxx seemed town and Junpei seemed scum.  I don't even know if I said Junpei was scum before I even started reading, so that might have just been part of my thought process from our conversation.<br>\n<br>\nSeriously?  I'm scum for getting a couple of basic reads from interaction?  I'm scum for giving my impression of people as I was reading through the thread and then finishing my catch up post with the pool of who I thought the scum were?  Like, seriously, is this guy for real?  Is anyone actually buying this?  This makes me a friendly flaotie.  Whatever that is.  I'm not ready to just float with my reads. <br>\n<br>\nHe says this:<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>ScumKhan wrote:</cite><br>\nSome given before you read the game, some during, some after, some randomly, some when asked, etc. </div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nThis is completely false.  Yes, I said I had a town read on Slaxx for something he said.  I gave my thoughts about the game and what I was thinking as I was reading, when no one else was around, said who I thought was in the pool of scum that very night.  My reads are there, clear and plain, I did this the night I replaced in.  No one had to ask me.  KK asked for a bulleted reads list, which I said I wanted to iso everyone to make sure of my thoughts.  That was the only thing asked for.  My reads were already out in the open.<br>\n<br>\nThis is such a blatant distortion of the events from the first night:<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>scumkhan wrote:</cite><br>\nYour first interaction with Junpei was to ask him if he was scum in your first post after you claimed to have only read his post. So, no. You didn't read him as town for trying to read your slot. Meaning you treated him differently from Slaxx, right? So, why?</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nNow, when he decides to insult my personality, he tells me not to be sarcastic, which would mean he read: <br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Tammy wrote:</cite><br>\nI was joking. I hadn't read a damn thing. I called Slaxx and you scum in that post...the two names I recognized. You thought it was serious? Like W.T.F???</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nSo, for him to characterize me as treating two people differently when I already explained the question he asked is distorting.  He's trying to make me look like I did something I didn't.  And is ignoring the very post in which I explained myself.  This is what I was referring to when I said he's ignoring the posts which answer the questions he has because HE DOESN'T CARE ABOUT THE ANSWERS.  HE ONLY CARES ABOUT GETTING SOMEONE MISLYNCHED.<br>\n<br>\nAgain, he ignores that this has already been answered:<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>scumkhan wrote:</cite><br>\nSince the vote-count immediately before your first post lists myself and Slaxx at 2 votes each, why do you predict a Slaxx flip of scum and not me?</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Tammy wrote:</cite><br>\nI was joking. I hadn't read a damn thing. I called Slaxx and you scum in that post...the two names I recognized. You thought it was serious? Like W.T.F???</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nNotice how he calls me friendly floatie again - That is direct provocation so that he can get a reaction to call me scum some more.<br>\n<br>\nKK - You did not answer the question.  What is your read on Junpei and why.  Do not give me some weak bullshit answer like duh I'm calling you v. Junpei scum v. town as if that means anything.  It doesn't.  It does not give an answer for your read at all.  Do not beat around the bush with this.  You want answers from me.  You want to be a jerk and demand things from me, you can follow suit.  Your answer does absolutely nothing for me.  I'm town, so it does even less.<br>\n<br>\nLook I can already tell from your demeanor, that you're going to win this.  I don't have the experience that you have to be able to defend myself in a way that you're not going to be able to twist to make me look bad.  But, here is the fact.  I will flip town.  I want your read on Junpei out in the open.  I want it now.  I want it based on evidence that is independent of me.  I also want your updated read on Psyche.  Both of the reads that you gave people were from when you replaced in.  What you linked me to is not good enough.  And, yes, this is me making demands of you.  You've gone out of your way to distort what I've done and said to make me look bad, I'm not going to tiptoe around you because you're making me look bad and trying to get me mislynched.<br>\n<br>\nKK - As far as the read on Slaxx, I did give him a town read based on some things he said.  I am interested in what he says in his read on me because that should help me determine whether or not my initial read on him was correct.  He did give a main reason for why he thinks I'm town and that does actually follow with what I know of him and how his friend would read me.  <br>\n<br>\nHow would you in a million years think that that interaction was me asking permission to bus?  Like what?  This is you deliberately trying to make someone look bad.  Why wouldn't you ask me if you wanted to know what it meant?  IT'S BECAUSE YOU DON'T.  You're not interested in finding the truth.  You're interested in trying to distort a conversation or fill it with meaning that it doesn't have.  His lack of giving me a read is the only thing that gives me pause; however, he did give a read he just didn't say why.<br>\n<br>\nWhy wouldn't I want to make sure that a read I have of someone is correct?  I've had confirmation bias before on my town and scum reads, and I really try to make an effort to understand that I can be wrong, so I try to get answers the way I know how.  I know it might not make sense to you or anyone why I think that Slaxx's read on me will help me determine his thought process and alignment, and in the end it might not.  I think it might though, so we'll see.<br>\n<br>\nAlso everyone should note that he is now doing what he did yesterday.  He had this big scum read on Slaxx but voted for Fatcast because *reasons*, which left him able to push Slaxx today.  Now, he's got this one of Tammy-Slaxx is scum or one of Tammy-Junpei is scum.<br>\n<br>\nWell isn't that just convenient.  So, when I flip town, he's got his next two potential mislynches lined up.  The only way they won't be is if Slaxx and Junpei are partners.

I realize that he would probably ask why for most votes, but after he wanted me to quickly vote KK when I replaced in I'm unsettled.<br>\n<br>\nActually, his urgency in getting KK voted (wasn't he urging Slaxx to to that just before I replaced in as well?) and my initial scum read on him makes me feel blech about sharing a wagon with him right now.<br>\n<br>\nEXCEPT look at KK's most recent post.  He wants roflcopter to iso HIM and then give feedback on his cases on Slaxx and me.  When I'm town and I make a case on someone and I want someone's opinion on something, whether they just replaced in or not, I don't ask them to iso me and then give feedback on the case.  I ask them to iso the person, read my case and give feedback.  But, that's because as town I'm interested in an honest opinion.  I'm interested in them reading their iso and seeing if they see what I see or if I'm wrong in my assertions.  KK doesn't care.<br>\n<br>\nAnyway after tomorrow, I'll be able to pick back up with my re-read of the thread and see if I can get a stronger opinion on Farside.<br>\n<br>\nStill think scum will be found in Junpei/KK/Farside though.", "time": "Tue Jul 10, 2012 1:09 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=22361&start=800", "forum": "53", "thread": "22361"}

If we really decide not to mass claim, then I will probably reassess where he goes on the list.<br>\n<br>\nI'm working the opposite way as a lot of people do. Most look for scum. I do that to, but I typically do it by PoE: Knock out who I think is town, due partner exclusions, then choose the lynch from there. Here's a method of what I usually do, and you can look at it in any of my past games (thoughy by now i do admittedly have 1-2 scum reads by page 10 or so, its a smaller game and im finding it a bit harder):<br>\n<br>\nPlayers 1-9 are playing a game. I'm pretty sure 1,2,3,4 are all town.

I can confidently say:<br>\n<br>\n6's only possible partner is 7. Therefore, if my reads are correct, there's 0-1 scum between (6,7) and 1-2 between (8,9)<br>\n<br>\nThen Id list out all the different combinations and see which pairings were most likely.

If you are town, then that means that you noted a town-tell, then read the entire game with such a town-oriented confirmation bias towards Slaxx's behavior that I don't ever recall seeing a town player ever do that.

Town often don't pay enough attention to the thread to realize there's a question for them.  In my experience, ignoring questions comes from town far more often than scum because scum tend to go out of their way to try to be compliant with everyone and keep in everyone's good graces.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nI always find it a scum tell not to answer questions. It means you either (1) have something to hide and (2) there is no reason for town not to answer questions asked.

That is when it clicked and all made sense that of course we would have a cop (or something) if we have a bodyguard, and it would make sense for there to be a roleblocker too.<br>\n<br>\nI suck at issues of balance.  Literally suck at it.  I have to have things about roles and issues explained to me almost every game, and I've never played in a 9-player game before.  I'm not dumb and I'm not playing dumb; I just don't know a whole lot about what to expect with roles.  I'm learning but it's not my storng suit.  <br>\n<br>\nI have at least a littel bit of pride.

I don't agree with the points against Slaxx.  I don't find them scum tells so I didn't decide that one town tell negated a whole bunch of scum tells.  One - I don't think having to go back and re-read a game to give thoughts is a scum tell.  I have to do that in games I'm actually in.  Sometimes on a quick break from work I might follow a games happenings on my phone, but when I get home to give my thoughts I have to go back.  A friend of mine is playing in the Murder in the Louvre game.  I've been reading along.  If I were to have replaced into that game, I would have to go back and read because I wouldn't be able to give my thoughts from just me casually reading along.  Two - Reading and playing IS a different experience.  These are two of your major points that I think are absolute crap.  The others we could have discussed.  I don't know about the mass claim thing because I've only played in a few games that have mass claimed.  Like literally don't know much about the pros and cons.

If he came back with a strong town read for bullshit reasons that don't follow with how his friend thinks, as he said they typically think alike, or even a scum read for other bullshit reasons, it would make me re-evaluate him.

His friend <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">can</div> read me really really well.  But his friend has seen me as scum and as town multiple times.  He's misread me as town because there are certain behaviors that are rather strong town tells of mine that he thought were suspicious the first time we were town together.  Since he knows my town play and he's seen me try to mimic my town play and react in ways that people who know me will test me on to figure out my alignment when they're unsure, I'm easy for him to read as he says that my scum and town play are near polar opposites.  I'm easy for a few people to read, but not everyone.  <br>\n<br>\nWhat I wanted to see from Slaxx might not make sense to you, but it does to me.  I know why I'm an easy read to some people, but that shouldn't apply to Slaxx necessarily, so his reaction to me could have told me something based on that unless he was told what to look for.  (Now Slaxx has seen me as scum before, but only for a day and I'm pretty sure he had a light town read on me at one point so that might not even help with him knowing how to read me.)<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>scumkhan wrote:</cite><br>\nStop lying.

{"number": 868, "id": "4179874", "user": "Tammy", "user_id": "18197", "content": "Okay so, I was able to finish re-reading and I came away with the same reads.<br>\n<br>\nI'm still reading Slaxx as town.  I read with what Farside said in mind, but I don't see the issues with scumhunting that she pointed out.  And I still believe the points against him are very weak and don't read as scum tells.  One of the points that farside keeps bringing against him is the overreaction to pressure and votes.  I consider emotions to be town tells not scum tells so these points are meh.  Heh...Faraday, in describing how to read me, told a game recently to run a few votes on me and I flip the fuck out as town, most of the time.  It's something I have a hard time faking as scum.  People that know how to read me know I react strongly to votes and suspicion when town in a way that I don't when scum.  I'm actually trying to be less emotional as town so I don't get caught as easily as scum.  Fancy that.  So, for me this isn't a scum tell at all.<br>\n<br>\nAgain, I still think that if he were scum he would very easily be able to use the suspicion against me when I replaced in instead of saying he heard I was an easy read.  Upon replacing in I would have been a far easier person to try to get lynched if he was going survivalistic and trying to save himself, but he didn't.  Also, look at his reasons for not voting KK when they were waiting on a replacement.  That just doesn't sound like it comes from scum to me.<br>\n<br>\nRainbowDash is still town.  Yes, now I understand that he has to be the town cop.  Geeze sorry for the paranoia, not realizing the bodyguard was there, and not being well-versed in issues of balance<br>\n<br>\nroflcopter - Completely null.  Psyche did read as strong town on day one, but day two seemed like active lurking to me.  I like the gut town read on Slaxx, so that's good.  But, he hasn't been around long enough for me to evaluate him.  I don't like that he read KK's distorted case on me and isn't looking any further.  This is worrisome.<br>\n<br>\nStill think scum will be found in Junpei/KK/Farside<br>\n<br>\nJunpei - I'm less convinced of Junpei than when I replaced in.  The feeling that he's trying to direct the game is troubling.  It could be part of his personality, but sometimes scum feel like they are in more control and it comes out in the way they play.  I get a sense of that.  Many of my original issues still hold.  However, he's thrown me off by giving me a town read in the midst of this.  Scum are less likely to do this, so for him to take a step back from our original argument, reassess and say my thought process more likely comes from town isn't something that I would expect him to do as scum.  He could be joining the crusade against me with KK but he's not.  This has me hesitating and is shaking my previous read.<br>\n<br>\nKK - Scum.  The only thing that makes me hesitate is how hard he's pushing me right now.  He would know this is going to be a mislynch if he makes it go through, but i don't know KK's style as I've never played with him before.  This could be his scum self.  For him to say the things he has, claim he's been objective (LULZ) while at the same time using rhetorical language that is false and designed to provoke a reaction and distort the things I've said and done and then refuse to listen to anything I say is really weird.  I can't see it coming from town though either.  Seriously look at the case on Slaxx.  Look at the case on me.  It's so full of shallow scum hunting and blatant misrepresentations of what has happened.  He's negated things said which answer his complaints all in the hopes of securing mislynches.  This is not town trying to make sure town wins; this is scum.<br>\n<br>\nFarside - farside's play bothers me and I think it's likely that she is scum as well and would fit as KK's partner I think.  Farside spent the majority of day two declaring a Junpei/FC scum team.  That's pretty much all she talked about.  Then KK shows up and starts going after Slaxx.  All of a sudden Junpei isn't on the table anymore and everything is about Slaxx.  Her case on Slaxx is just as shallow as KK's and it's rather weird the way she dropped Junpei to go after Slaxx but today says that if it weren't for her suspicion of Slaxx and Psyche, then she'd go after Junpei.  Her attitude about Junpei is what makes me more concerned about Junpei and about her.  My concerns about them being a possible partner are probably the strongest thing that gives me doubt about KK being scum.", "time": "Wed Jul 11, 2012 10:03 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=22361&start=850", "forum": "53", "thread": "22361"}

Also, please excuse the stream-of-conciousness style nature of this post. LYLO is the time of the game where everything should be brought to the table. Since town has nothing but VTs, then that means all I can bring is my thoughts, unvarnished.<br>\n<br>\nNow, I hate being in LYLO. I'm happy that I usually rarely get there since I start to get crippled by second guessing myself. Add to that, my two strongest scum-reads during the course of the game (Slaxx and Tammy) are still alive and are calling each other town. Which is the strongest position for scum to be in. If they are scum together, then by refusing to bus each other the pressure is on town to recognize each other's towniness. This is an effective strategy since if me, Junpei, and roflcopter are town, we are extremely fractured.<br>\n<br>\nOf course, that's only one scenario, and an egotistical one at that. It would mean I haven't been wrong all course, just unconvincing. But it's a possible one.<br>\n<br>\nThe converse to that scenario is that I'm 100% wrong and the scum-team is Junpei and roflcopter. Which I have a hard-time seeing. First, Psyche's opening strategy was extremely town. I mean, I know it's possible for scum to fake such a gambit, but (and no offense meant) I just don't think that Psyche is experienced and skilled enough to have faked it as scum. Plus if he were scum and pulled off a successful early gambit that put him on everyone's town list, it's extremely unlikely that he would abandon the game. When you do something like that as scum, you stay in the game and see it through, if only for the bragging rights alone. So roflcopter isn't scum despite the fact that he's been really unimpressive since replacing back in.<br>\n<br>\nNow Junpei... Junpei is the wildcard for me. If I'm wrong about one of {Slaxx, Tammy} then he's the scum partner. He's been tunnelled on me all game. Now I recognize that being wrong isn't a scumtell in itself, but as weird as this sounds he hasn't been too convincing about it. Lots of \"We should lynch Kublai Khan!\" yelling and \"look at that! he's scum!\" confirmation bias. But not much substance. I have to scroll way back in his iso to even find his case on me. And it's a pretty poor case considering ow much I've posted. Now, it's possible that he's just laziness, but laziness isn't a personality quirk that I would assign to Junpei. So scummy? Eh, a little. it's a weak point and the rest of his play has been pretty towny, so he remains a distant third suspect in my book.<br>\n<br>\nSo my thoughts remain with a Slaxx/Tammy scum-team. I'll start with Tammy. <br>\n<br>\nFirst, this:<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4197776#p4197776\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4197776#p4197776\" data-post-id=\"4197776\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 977</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=18197\">Tammy</a> wrote:</cite>Why not acknowledge it?

It doesn't address my question and just adds fluff and misdirection to the game. You didn't have admit that you were wrong. I mean, it's a given that you were wrong since before Rainbowdash even died. There's no oevrall town-benefit to admitting wrongness so...  uh, yeah. Plus there's zero reason to bring up Team Mafia as a source of paranoia since IIRC you were scum in TM. So where would the paranoia come from? <br>\n<br>\nActually that brings up the core reasoning behind why I think you're scum. When I read a game, I weigh an individual's play according to two categories: likely to come from town and likely to come from scum. Now mafia, by nature, is a game of paranoia. Every action has potential to have been committed by scum unless there is strong reason to think otherwise (see my read on Psyche/roflcopter, for example). So when someone is town, they need to actively commit town-tells to effective counter the paranoia of fellow town members.<br>\n<br>\nNow I'm trying to take into account you're relative newness to the site/game, but it's not enough. You spammed the game from the onset. You reacted to pressure by OMGUSing and defended yourself by accusing me of \"misrepping you and trying to get mislynches\" which isn't a valid defense. If you are town, then the knowledge that you are a mislynch is known only to you and you'd know it's irrational to expect anyone to listen to you. So I can't figure out any town motivation for your defense, but I can figure scum motivation. <br>\n<br>\nSlaxx.. Slaxx is just plain scum. I posted my case on Slaxx in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4154186#p4154186\">Post 568</a> and he never responded. Instead the game gets side-tracted by Tammy replacing in and Slaxx just lurked pretty hard the rest of the day  Also, I really don't like the fact that he'd acknowledge that farside22 is town, yet refuse to address her case at all. It's write more but I don't need to. Slaxx is scum because it's self-evident. <br>\n<br>\nI'm tired now. and I have to dig more tomorrow. I'm announcing my strong intentions to vote Slaxx.

I have no problem admitting I was wrong, and if you look at my original post it was clear I was acknowledging my embarrassment at being extremely wrong about something that was obvious to everyone else.  Also, I never said Team Mafia helped to instill my paranoia.  I've used Team Mafia twice - Slaxx and I played in a game together in which I replaced in as scum.  Him not using that to his advantage when I replaced in here is where I got my initial town read on Slaxx.  <br>\n<br>\nThe second time, where it relates to the RainbowDash situation was the Team Mafia results thread in which the balance of the game I played in was brought up.  It was following that discussion, in which in a 13 player game town had a back up role, a tracker, and a bodyguard.  Scum had a roleblocker.  In following the discussion on balance, I realized what everyone had already been saying -  that the bodyguard is there to protect the town role.  I then also remembered when GreyIce was asked why he didn't guard anyone night one, he said that the bodyguard exists to protect power roles.  That's when it clicked and made sense that there would be a cop if there was a bodyguard here.  It had nothing to do with the game itself or my alignment in the game, but the balance discussion which made things in this game more clear.<br>\n<br>\nMy paranoia was coming from someone who claimed town cop and L-1 and was being treated as confirmed town.  I didn't pay attention to the bodyguard issue until it was pointed out to me, and it didnt' sink in until reading that discussion about balance.

Not very credible as he could have just been claiming cop to get out of a lynch or to draw out the real cop.<br>\n<br>\nWhy are we accepting RD as confirmed town basically? Why didn't he die last night if he's the town cop? Aren't town cops like the first to go?

Awful. Absolutely awful AND speaks to him buddying confirmed town. Why is it ridiculous for me to question the confirmed town of someone who claimed cop at L-1? I dont' just take claims at face value. So, I'm scum because I didn't know there was a bodyguard until it was mentioned? I'm scum because I didn't know the balance of the game until Slaxx pointed out why it was most likely? How is it scummy to try to figure out if someone everyone is saying is confirmed is actually confirmed. Why is it scummy for me to try to determine if someone fake claimed? And then in his next post he mocks me for not reading the mod post. So I'm scum for not looking at the list of dead people and seeing what their roles are  Kay.<br>\n<br>\nSo, he buddies on this point and then tries to make me look bad for asking a LEGITIMATE question in an attempt to make sense of the game.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Tammy wrote:</cite><br>\nHow hard is it to grasp that I DIDN'T REALIZE THERE WAS A BODYGUARD UNTIL IT WAS POINTED OUT TO ME?????????<br>\n<br>\nI understand now. In fact, I'll let you in on a little secret. I didn't give up my paranoia on this issue until yesterday. Why? Because I've been following this discussion here: viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;t=22615&amp;p=4179085#p4179085 which has to do with the balance of the CN game. Yesterday is when I remembered that we had a bodyguard in that game to protect the tracker. That is when it clicked and all made sense that of course we would have a cop (or something) if we have a bodyguard, and it would make sense for there to be a roleblocker too.<br>\n<br>\nI suck at issues of balance. Literally suck at it. I have to have things about roles and issues explained to me almost every game, and I've never played in a 9-player game before. I'm not dumb and I'm not playing dumb; I just don't know a whole lot about what to expect with roles. I'm learning but it's not my storng suit. <br>\n<br>\nI have at least a littel bit of pride. I wouldn't fake ignorance over something that would make me look so stupid. I'm sick and tired of scum trying to make me feel stupid for not understanding things when I'm trying to understand how things work.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nIf you have not been able to get from that exchange that I don't have a firm grasp of issues of balance, then I don't know what to tell you.  Sure, maybe it would make sense to YOU for there to be a cop without a bodyguard, but it didn't make sense to me.  Maybe after I've been playing this game for five years, this will be something familiar to me.  Right now I go off of what I have experience with, and this is a set up I have never played in.<br>\n<br>\nCan we be done with this conversation now?
