I didn't feel it was an all too serious vote nor did I really expect it to be, but I could at least try and understand how Mario would explain himself or how he would react to the questions I gave him. Needless to say, I didn't like how he was constantly insisting that I vote mostly because 1) Votes aren't permanent, and can change at any time and 2) I had no reason to vote someone. I'm pretty sure Mario just wanted to see if I took his bait and voted someone so he could get a read out of it, though I guess that makes me a bit of a jerk because I decided to act a bit coy and ignore his demands. I think Mario is the type of player who isn't all that analytical or spends time explaining himself unless needed to, but I do think that him trying to appease me and eventually answering my questions was enough to feel that his intentions could be town motivated. <br><br>I had a gut RVS read on TwoFace even if it wasn't really developed nor went anywhere. I placed my vote on him in RVS to see if he'd take a bite but I suppose that requires giving words to it. I don't know how to feel about him coming onto me because in one regard he thinks I'm an alt and in the other he says I should go back to the newbie queue for thinking Mario could have a developed scum read two pages in. It felt like he was sidelining the whole instance between me and mario instead of really getting involved, which I didn't like.<br><br>Everyone else I don't have a definitive read on outside of gut which isn't worth mentioning at this current point. I'll be around later to see how the thread develops."}

He said that town shouldn't ignore questions, on top of just making a completely exaggerated stance about the game that I was really tempted to laugh at. I really couldn't believe when he had the gall to say in his #173 that he has given an 'accurate' representation of the game thus far, as if his word was seemingly law. I don't like this behavior from him because again, it shows an inability to consider alternatives that is not purely based on his playstyle, rather what I feel is scummy. Scum don't really want to explain themselves if they have to, nor really get involved or think about things because they only care to push mislynches or seem like their intentions are town-motivated. In this case, I feel TwoFace would continue to drive the point about me being scum because it would seemingly make him consistent, but the problem lies in the fact his reasons don't make sense and are very shallow. This is furthered by his behavior in general, which isn't really justified. If you want to explain to me why a town would hold standards to some players and not others, by all means do it."}

His problem with Jord was only that he didn't answer his question therefore he was hiding something, and when I told him that perhaps he should consider a different perspective, the conversation didn't last long and he switched his focus purely back on me. He didn't seem interested in talking furhter about it so that begs the question where his priorities lay. Are me and Jord scum together? Are all people who don't answer questions scum? These are things I can't really answer and only TwoFace can, but the fact remains he really hasn't and I don't believe that is town behavior. If you still believe my argument is based on a playstyle I don't know what else to tell you.</div></blockquote><br>RE: 83 - Your response to my question about not noticing mario's intention didn't answer my question. I basically asked you how you did not notice that mario was clearly trying to get reactions and you pointed me to posts you made about generating discussion. That didn't answer my question. <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">What I wanted to know is how can you be a person who is interested in looking at reactions not notice that what mario did was clearly a post designed to get reactions.</span><br><br>RE: 151 - I answered your question about LAL honestly so i am not sure what your issue is with that. I don't think townies should ever lie. I certainly never do. I think scum need to lie as little as possible. I am all about honesty and once you prove you are a dishonest person i think you are scum. I am naive in thinking town won't lie, because that is how I play so the moment you lied i knew you were scum.<br><br>RE: 156 - You came to Jord's defense. how is that an attempt to learn more about my read. Jord made a comment which casted shade on another player. I asked jord to explain his thoughts why he thought mario's actions were suspicious. he refused to answer not once but twice.  i don't really see a townie doing that and I explained that to you. So if anything that exchange should have actually accomplished what you were hoping for. If you still don't understand my scum read on jordan, feel free to ask me more questions.</div></blockquote><br><br>TwoFace, a lot of your problems can be solved by looking at what I'm saying. This is why repeating myself and trying to interact with you is pointless. I wanted to try and see what people said about our interaction but instead here we are. I decided to unvote because at the least you are trying to respond to me, but don't think that I instantly townread you as of yet. Bolded, again. #43 and #49, I did notice it. From my perspective, it seems like you either have selective hearing or forget about details because you are too caught up in your tunneling to see anything else.<br><br>Second point, I am sorry you feel that way. I can't always be Honest Abe nor will I try to be.<br><br>Third point, yes, I came to his seemingly \"defense\" but I offered you to think about it differently. I told you that he perhaps had cold feet. I feel right now if you are town, we simply have dissenting opinions and you don't like that. Do you disagree about my assumption on a fundamental level or is there something more? All you said is that he didn't answer your question therefore he is scummy."}

This isn't just because he gave me a town pass but moreso I just believe that his laziness/ineffectiveness is not a staple of him being scum. It feels a bit rudimentary to talk in this way, but you could even say it's just a playstyle. I'm not really on the same page when it comes as to how you should read players but I believe understanding tone is important. Mush/Sheep, do you really think Mafia would be making statements like these if they were concerned about being lynched? I am not saying that scum can't play lazy or lurk, but what I got from Ingeel is that he's just a poor man's town who doesn't want to put the effort in, not a scum trying to skate along. I believe that more often than not, most scum will try and posture themselves and look as best as possible, unless somehow Ingeel is known for being lazy as scum and there's some kind of tell in that. Unfortunately, the people who know Ingeel all replaced out so I suppose I'll never know. <br><br>That being said, the whole posturing thing I was talking about is something that I bring up because I feel some players are doing it, more importantly Sheep. I don't have enough to warrant a vote nor make a concrete stance as of yet, but consider this a IGMEOY as I believe some of his posts feel very mechanical in how they are made, which is in contrast of Ingeel who I believe is not really thinking hard about what a good town does, therefore seems innocent."}

While we're at it Ingeel has also ducked a question, and Face hasn't attacked that either - but it makes perfect sense because, especially early in the game when you're learning to connect names and avatars, it's super easy to miss something like a question dodge when it isn't addressed, and much easier to note them when they are specifically responded to with a refusal to answer/you're the one who asked the question. The cases he's raised tends to fall into the latter - easier to note issues, and as a core position 'people should be willing to answer questions about the game to help town solve the game' he's correct, they should - so to call it a scumtell seems perfectly fine, so literally all you've got is it might be scummy because he's applying it unevenly.<br><br>And if you think that, vote Ingeel.<br>And if not, I don't get the issue with me calling him town.</div></blockquote><br><br>Not sure where you got that argument, I didn't even mention certain play being optimal and others not being. I think his posts have mostly either been indistinguishable fluff or hardheaded assurance in himself that doesn't really make a lot of sense to me. It's not the playstyle that sets me off, it is just the general uncooperative behavior and only focusing on <span style=\"font-style: italic\">one</span> point instead of considering others. I'd like to think most town are open minded, even to a small extent.  Funny enough, I think Ingeel is alright in my book, even if he fits into your assumption that I am only attacking TwoFace based on playstyle concern.</div></blockquote>Uncopperativeness is a towntell. If anything, scum are going to be MORE coperative. <br><br>--<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9247994#p9247994\" class=\"postlink\">post 201</a>, MarioManiac4 wrote:</cite><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: purple\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span style=\"font-size: 200%; line-height: 116%;\">HELLO CITIZENS OF SUNSHINE TOWN!</span></span></span></span><br>I have noticed people are sitting on RVS votes or not voting!

I consider myself someone who can remain pretty composed but I have to say I was and am pissed to hear someone making statements like this. There is absolutely no excuse for this type of behavior as Mafia is a team game, where town has more success cooperating with each other and working a single function instead of individualizing themselves throughout. To say that only<span style=\"font-style: italic\"> you </span>want to win is the biggest slap in the fucking face to anyone who has posted thus far, including me. I agree with sheep in that ignoring slots likely doesn't make a problem go away, but as a member of the town, I have to raise concern here. I have considered in my head trying to respond to your never ending list of complaints but I feel I'd be wasting my breath because you feel dignified in everything you do.

Mush's posts are very generalized and aren't really that full of substance. The pushes he has made aren't very strong and there is a lack of conviction in his words. Mush spends a lot of time speaking of uncertainty or very loosely to the point where a lot of his posts feel incomplete. They're not explicitly hard to follow but it raises the question why some of them exist. A further example made is his #303 in which he chimed in about something but never had it go anywhere. I think that his push on LaLight is decent so I may retract these thoughts if Lalight is scum, and my read on Mush is more-so independent than anything.</div></div></div><br><br>2. <span style=\"color: #BF0000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">MarioManiac4</span></span><br><div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: </b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display: none;\">I don't really know where to start with Mario and I've been teetering about him for a while. I think he's been taking far too much time defending himself and the steps he's made after his whole debauchery about votes isn't impressive. I mentioned to Sheep how I felt it was losing it's charm but what's more impressive is how willing Mario was to drop it completely. Granted, people try different things all the time in order illicit responses, but why spend all that time building yourself as a proprietor of voting if it wasn't going to go anywhere in terms of scumhunting? There was seemingly no point to it all and I have retracted my feeling on early interaction because of this. I think Mario felt convicted to double-down but then dropped it because he started to get suspicion because of it, which doesn't look good.   This is furthered by a generally confusing priority from him such as #368 where he votes lalight and says he doesn't have many scumreads, and then hops off based on a single response from LaLight in #372. This doesn't make sense to me because in #146, he had LaLight as his strongest scumread and seemed to have enough to put players in brackets, though there isn't much to show as far why they are in there. Even now, Mario doesn't make a lot of sense to me and his explanations in #439 have a lot left to be desired, as I don't believe how long he continued to rant about votes was merely for RVS purposes, given he was still doing it by the time I would consider it over with.</div></div></div><br><br>3. <span style=\"color: #FF8000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Cooperative Sheep</span></span><br><div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: </b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display: none;\">At a first glance, there's a lot to like about this slot, though I don't know if it's good enough. CooperativeSheep seems reasonable in one regard yet also has a certain vibe in his posts that bother me. Based on purely on what he's done, he spends a lot of time talking <span style=\"font-style: italic\">at</span> people instead of talking <span style=\"font-style: italic\">with</span> them, which isn't something I'm too impressed by. I don't think his reasoning on Ingeel was all that great and I am generally cautious of posts like #206 where sheep signals to vote with him without doing the dirty work, if that makes sense. Overall it feels like he is taking a bystander position instead of getting fully involved, and I'm not going to count his interaction with TwoFace because I thought it wasn't beneficial.

I believe that scum right now in the chance of LaLight being town would be more favored to push his slot given it hasn't been very strong and has been generating a lot of controversy, but instead Mulch continues to do his own thing and is very genuine about his stances.

I think that his #348 is especially telling in this sense because I don't believe that LaLight would come after his own partner in the fashion he did. This is the second reason why I am advocating his lynch at this point, as it would clear up Mush more in my head; I don't think Mush/LaLight are a team.</div></div></div><br><br>6. <span style=\"color: #FFFF40\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">iDanyBoy</span></span><br><div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: </b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display: none;\">I'm not really paying attention to this slot tbh.

I felt that MM4's vote on LaLight is more telling in a scum perspective because it felt like he was trying to allocate fake pressure on a partner as a means of distancing, though it never went anywhere. I also don't get why LaLight never really bothered with it either but perhaps LaLight's scum style plays in part with that. Maybe it could be even said that MM4 lied about his convictions if  #36, #37 are telling in that category. Someone slightly below null does not belong in the lowest scum bracket, but what's even further confusing is this post statement:<br><br>#58<br><blockquote><div><cite>MM4 wrote:</cite>I didn't really have a firm stance on lalight</div></blockquote><br><br>#146<br><blockquote><div><cite>MM4 wrote:</cite>{MM4}<br>{Syndesis, TwoFace}<br>{TrueGent, mush}<br>{noseacaballo, Cooperative Sheep, I Am Innocent, Ingeel, iDanyBoy, Dragnalus}<br>{Jordarrian, <span class=\"noboldsig\">LaLight</span>}</div></blockquote><br><br>#341<br><blockquote><div><cite>MM4 wrote:</cite>what caused me to try to wagon lalight on page 2 was because I wanted to get out of rvs early- when that goes on too long I can get disengaged with the game and it helps meh wincon because we can scumhunt more</div></blockquote> <br><br>One of these things is not like the other. <br><br>He's most likely scum but there's something sinister about how he is wording things and putting people in pools, especially LaLight. If you read his arguments prior to this, he had placed me scummier than LaLight and said that we could possibly be partners etc. The fact is that you cannot say something is 'slightly below null' and then put them as Scum #2 in your pool. There is also a disconnect where MM4 never seemed to bother with pursuing his LaLight read further.<br><br>I will say however his reapplied vote to LaLight is awful and then immediate jump off of him based on a single response, but I think it's telling. I don't know, entertain the idea with me for a minute and I will promptly switch my vote after."}

This isn't just because he gave me a town pass but moreso I just believe that his laziness/ineffectiveness is not a staple of him being scum. It feels a bit rudimentary to talk in this way, but you could even say it's just a playstyle. I'm not really on the same page when it comes as to how you should read players but I believe understanding tone is important. Mush/Sheep, do you really think Mafia would be making statements like these if they were concerned about being lynched? I am not saying that scum can't play lazy or lurk, but what I got from Ingeel is that he's just a poor man's town who doesn't want to put the effort in, not a scum trying to skate along. I believe that more often than not, most scum will try and posture themselves and look as best as possible, unless somehow Ingeel is known for being lazy as scum and there's some kind of tell in that. Unfortunately, the people who know Ingeel all replaced out so I suppose I'll never know. <br><br>That being said, the whole posturing thing I was talking about is something that I bring up because I feel some players are doing it, more importantly Sheep. I don't have enough to warrant a vote nor make a concrete stance as of yet, but consider this a IGMEOY as I believe some of his posts feel very mechanical in how they are made, which is in contrast of Ingeel who I believe is not really thinking hard about what a good town does, therefore seems innocent.[/quote]<br>Usually I'm active but this feels so much like my newbie and it makes me not want to do shit<br><br>I'm also seldom replying, trying to catch up while i can"}

And I don't know why that would discourage people to post. If people are complaining about activity levels and you are a low activity player that is a hint that people are complaining about you and the solution isn't to continue to post less. The solution is to post more. <br><br>Also how can you speak for an entire group of people? <br><br>The reality is YOU are discouraged to post because you don't have anything to say. You have messed up and are now laying low in hopes the attention moves on to somebody else. This is your 2nd attempt this game to do so.<br><br>clearly your scum game needs work.

There are plenty of scenarios which makes this not good. For example, you are from ToS, I believe. So is Ingeel. It's possible you did this so that he wouldn't realise you were scum here.

Logic, gut, emotion, and motivation, in my opinion, all have their places. For example, my overwhelming logic in the face of your tunnel makes me obvtown. I have the best gut- my posts are genuine.

If you think TwoFace is wrong, take the time to look into why he's pushing who he's pushing and think about whether you agree with it or not - give him feedback. Lay out why you think your townreads are town and be open to hearing why you might be wrong since chances are you'll be wrong somewhere. Best case scenario you and TwoFace reach an understanding and don't end up at each other's throats for the rest of the game and worst case you just can't see eye to eye and you ended up fleshing out things that are useful to the game as a whole anyways."}

If literally nothing can change your mind, you are not even willing to look at evidence. If you are Town, you are extremely confbiased (and indeed were when lynching Dragnalus). This is clearly anti-Town, as confbias only ends up leading Town on mislynch after mislynch, failing to consider evidence. The pot is calling the kettle black. If you are scum, this is easily believable as an attempt to push what you view as an easy misynch despite the claim.<br><br>Also, the roles together cannot be called broken if we have no idea what power roles Mafia has. Mafia very likely has a combination of Goons (which cannot be detected by Role Cops) and PRs (which can be detected by Role Cops but can weaken/negate Town PRs). This is like calling a claim broken just because the setup of PRs would be broken against a team of Goons, when in that case Mafia are highly likely to have PRs of their own.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9309377#p9309377\" class=\"postlink\">post 1274</a>, TwoFace wrote:</cite>Y'all will literally never change my mind.

Votes - especially in early game - are very very close to useless. Your first argument is that votes signify your scumread, but, in RVS they absolutely don't - you can vote people for any reason you want in RVS and very often that reason has absolutely nothing to do with whether you scumread that player or not. What <span style=\"font-style: italic\">actually</span> signifies your scumread is when you talk about it and give reasons for it - when TwoFace explained why he thought Drag's approach was scummy or when Syndesis talked about why she thought it wasn't or when Drag talked about thinking that Ingeel's response was off - these are the important and meaningful parts of the early game - not you voting Lalight or TwoFace voting Ingeel. Empty votes aren't pressure; empty votes aren't changing minds and empty votes aren't attracting other serious votes. When people bring up points, when people have reasons (or fool others into thinking they have reasons), that's when pressure happens.<br><br>If you are town here, then I am of the opinion (as of right this moment) that your early approach of the very two-dimensional push to vote derailed town off what was a fairly productive beginning (TwoFace was contributing early and your approach didn't hurt that but Syndesis and Drag were also contributing and you pretending like they weren't doing shit unless they were voting did discredit what they were doing) into something that was not so productive.<br><br>Mush's pair of <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9246238#p9246238\" class=\"postlink\">entry</a> <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9246250#p9246250\" class=\"postlink\">posts</a> come off as a bit awkward to me based on the language; things like \"maybe I still need to get used to this site's style of play, but that doesn't seem like a good reason\" come off as overly formal and thus fake. I think his attack on TrueGent is pretty shallow but it's a fine attack for page 5 and his observation of lalight buddying up to the two most active players is a perfectly reasonable worry to have and has more depth than most things posted so far."}

Assuming a Mafia Roleblocker, they would be unable to tell the difference between it and a Town Roleblocker (such as myself; although I am 2-shot, they do not know what modifiers the Mafia and/or Town Roleblockers have).

I think that it's a considerably less compelling case when mush replaced out; shows that the \"sitting back\" and \"allowing the game to unfold\" pieces pretty obviously didn't have an alignment-indicative agenda behind it unless you think he wouldn't be that inactive as town. Do you think that it still applies?"}

If literally nothing can change your mind, you are not even willing to look at evidence. If you are Town, you are extremely confbiased (and indeed were when lynching Dragnalus). This is clearly anti-Town, as confbias only ends up leading Town on mislynch after mislynch, failing to consider evidence. The pot is calling the kettle black.

Mafia very likely has a combination of Goons (which cannot be detected by Role Cops) and PRs (which can be detected by Role Cops but can weaken/negate Town PRs). This is like calling a claim broken just because the setup of PRs would be broken against a team of Goons, when in that case Mafia are highly likely to have PRs of their own.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9309377#p9309377\" class=\"postlink\">post 1274</a>, TwoFace wrote:</cite>Y'all will literally never change my mind.

I could see scum trying to frame syn only if they aren't being scum read, so it's like a win win situation cause if town lynches syn scum win, if town don't then scum isn't being scum read and town mislynches and they still win. That probably sounded complicated but I hope u get the point. The other senerio is that appearantly scum can kill themselves but isn't that playing against win-con? Idk and the mod didn't really give us a direct answer.<br>Anyways syn is cleared for now as far as I'm concerned but I still want to hear more from him. <br>I'm without Internet on my computer so I'm phone posting but I'll try to get on more. It is canada day weekend up here so I won't be super active but I'll still chime in one in a while.<br>Pedit: vig does make more sense with a maf doc."}

QED.<br><br>OK FOR REAL THOUGH<br>What Mulch basically did here was pick a target and stick to them. But when you read his ISO here, you won't see any reasoning that would cause this, you won't see anything of actual substance. I was Mulch's target. And because I was Mulch's target, Mulch never needed to scumhunt outside me. It's really that simple. Of course, what I initially thought was \"oh lol, confbiased stupid town\" but that isn't even it. I made an accurate observation at one point in my ISO; there was no way for him to get into the tunnel. All he did was, at some point in the game, decide \"lol mario is scum.\" What I'm saying is, there are certain ways town players get into tunnels, and this will usually involve scumreading someone, and then getting way too far into it, right? But this isn't what happened with Mulch. There was no natural progression at all. <br>Earlier, Mulch had shown the ability to reverse his opinion on people. He showed the ability to re-evaluate, he showed realistic read-flow. But when he began to \"tunnel\" me, that illusion came to a close. He stopped trying to read me- he started trying to scumread me. And you can see that as a constant throughout Mulch's ISO- once he begins to tunnel me, he never stops. He never thinks. Even after what he is doing has been explained, even after people have acknowledged how thoroughly crappy his tunnel was, he doesn't stop to re-evaluate. He never looks at my content. At one point, he posts a \"case.\" Of course, said case is utter bullshit and filled with artificial reasons to scumread me.<br>So why does he do this? Because it worked. Once Mulch started to push hard, he got a positive reaction. So he went further into the tunnel. I, and others, continued to townread him for this, so he did it. He did it, because he knew he could get away with it. It was simple, but effective. He drowned the thread in his noise, worked with the player who was just as stubborn as he was pretending to be, and pushed a lynch on a player he wasn't even scumreading based upon some BS associations. <br>Another thing that pings me extremely hard about Mulch is his self-defence. He pretends to be obvious town, and that's his casus belli for attacking those who scumread him. He gives \"reasons\" for this in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9273204#p9273204\">955</a>- that \"everything he does is townie\", which, to be quite frank, is blatant bullshit, and he says that he \"doesn't care about opinions on him\"- which a) is blatant BS again, and b) doesn't even make you town. These are supposed to be reasons for Mulch being obvious town, but really all they ever were is excuses- they don't mean anything. Mulch hyper-played the VI card, but he just doesn't make any sense as a VI, and I don't believe this is his town game at all. To be honest, Large 203 (Scale of the Universe) looks a lot more similar.<br><br>Oh yeah- I don't think you guys ever lynch Dunker. Mush's replace out was extremely town-motivated when I look back on it. Let's face it- things were extremely bleak for town on D3. Mush's claim was basically apathy. He posted a few times, claiming \"uhhhh MM4 is scum guys\" without really engaging with anything. And then, he replaced out. By flaking. But this wasn't a genuine flake. Within the window when Frog was prodding/looking for replacement, Mush never posted, but he WAS online. He even changed his sig and added an avatar. That raises the distinct question- WHY would scum ever do that? This game looked to be about as easy as it could get. But Mush replaced out anyway. That's because his apathy was genuine, that's because Mush wanted to quit a losing game, that's because Mush was town. Dunker and I are the universal scumreads right now. The thread's getting pretty dull. Everyone's content with this. Perhaps if, today or more likely tomorrow, the focus moves to Nacho and Syn, the game will gain its spark.<br><br>Quick reminder that Syndesis still hasn't given a reason for not shooting N1 and N2. There is literally no reason why you wouldn't do that as a Town 1-shot Vig. The reason she's not answering could be because she repeatedly missed it in her quest to not do any scumhunting whatsoever. But it's likely because she doesn't have an explanation, and knows that soon, I'll be dead. And it's SO convenient that the player who was shot just happened to be the Mafia who could kill themselves, especially when Syndesis wasn't even scumreading Vedith at all. Not to mention the fact that Syndesis has been doing literally no scumhunting for practically the entire game.<br><br>Ofc, it's unfortunate that Nacho can't really defend against this if he's town, because to the best of my knowledge Mulch isn't a Nacho alt. But right now, I'm thinking the team is Syndesis/Nacho."}

You can craft a theory that makes slightly more sense than whatever alternative but considering your theory still requires a scumteam that very sincerely and completely fucked up, I'm of the school of thought that we thank them for the nice mislynch and move on.
