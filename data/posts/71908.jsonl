I'm pretty sure Mario just wanted to see if I took his bait and voted someone so he could get a read out of it, though I guess that makes me a bit of a jerk because I decided to act a bit coy and ignore his demands. I think Mario is the type of player who isn't all that analytical or spends time explaining himself unless needed to, but I do think that him trying to appease me and eventually answering my questions was enough to feel that his intentions could be town motivated. <br>\n<br>\nI had a gut RVS read on TwoFace even if it wasn't really developed nor went anywhere. I placed my vote on him in RVS to see if he'd take a bite but I suppose that requires giving words to it. I don't know how to feel about him coming onto me because in one regard he thinks I'm an alt and in the other he says I should go back to the newbie queue for thinking Mario could have a developed scum read two pages in. It felt like he was sidelining the whole instance between me and mario instead of really getting involved, which I didn't like.<br>\n<br>\nEveryone else I don't have a definitive read on outside of gut which isn't worth mentioning at this current point. I'll be around later to see how the thread develops.", "time": "Wed May 24, 2017 5:22 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=71908&start=50", "forum": "53", "thread": "71908"}

He didn't seem interested in talking furhter about it so that begs the question where his priorities lay. Are me and Jord scum together? Are all people who don't answer questions scum?

Jord made a comment which casted shade on another player. I asked jord to explain his thoughts why he thought mario's actions were suspicious. he refused to answer not once but twice.  i don't really see a townie doing that and I explained that to you.

This is why repeating myself and trying to interact with you is pointless. I wanted to try and see what people said about our interaction but instead here we are. I decided to unvote because at the least you are trying to respond to me, but don't think that I instantly townread you as of yet. Bolded, again. #43 and #49, I did notice it.

I told you before that a lot of things you're saying are things scum could say, and I still stick to that.

This isn't just because he gave me a town pass but moreso I just believe that his laziness/ineffectiveness is not a staple of him being scum. It feels a bit rudimentary to talk in this way, but you could even say it's just a playstyle. I'm not really on the same page when it comes as to how you should read players but I believe understanding tone is important. Mush/Sheep, do you really think Mafia would be making statements like these if they were concerned about being lynched? I am not saying that scum can't play lazy or lurk, but what I got from Ingeel is that he's just a poor man's town who doesn't want to put the effort in, not a scum trying to skate along. I believe that more often than not, most scum will try and posture themselves and look as best as possible, unless somehow Ingeel is known for being lazy as scum and there's some kind of tell in that. Unfortunately, the people who know Ingeel all replaced out so I suppose I'll never know. <br>\n<br>\nThat being said, the whole posturing thing I was talking about is something that I bring up because I feel some players are doing it, more importantly Sheep.

While we're at it Ingeel has also ducked a question, and Face hasn't attacked that either - but it makes perfect sense because, especially early in the game when you're learning to connect names and avatars, it's super easy to miss something like a question dodge when it isn't addressed, and much easier to note them when they are specifically responded to with a refusal to answer/you're the one who asked the question. The cases he's raised tends to fall into the latter - easier to note issues, and as a core position 'people should be willing to answer questions about the game to help town solve the game' he's correct, they should - so to call it a scumtell seems perfectly fine, so literally all you've got is it might be scummy because he's applying it unevenly.<br>\n<br>\nAnd if you think that, vote Ingeel.<br>\nAnd if not, I don't get the issue with me calling him town.</div></blockquote>\n\nNot sure where you got that argument, I didn't even mention certain play being optimal and others not being. I think his posts have mostly either been indistinguishable fluff or hardheaded assurance in himself that doesn't really make a lot of sense to me. It's not the playstyle that sets me off, it is just the general uncooperative behavior and only focusing on <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">one</div> point instead of considering others. I'd like to think most town are open minded, even to a small extent.  Funny enough, I think Ingeel is alright in my book, even if he fits into your assumption that I am only attacking TwoFace based on playstyle concern.</div></blockquote>Uncopperativeness is a towntell.

He tries to cast shade on Mario implying that his vote on LAL was serious and acting like it was suspicious he switched.

That imo is hiding due to fear. <br>\n<br>\nHe goes on and basically describes my play style to a tee and votes me but says he's not voting me for my play style <br>\n<br>\nHe asks me if I believe in LAL, I say yes, he says he doesn't believe me (btw I can prove I do) and I say \"well<br>\nThat's how I feel\" and he uses that against me in a negative light as well as adding some extra words to make what I said seem worse than it actually was.   <br>\n<br>\nHe never once takes the time to verify if I'm telling the truth which he could easily do if he searched past games. <br>\n<br>\nAnd now negative attention is being cast onto mush so he pops up, drops a vote without any reason and makes another excuse about being busy. <br>\n<br>\nSo yeah lynch drag.

Mush spends a lot of time speaking of uncertainty or very loosely to the point where a lot of his posts feel incomplete. They're not explicitly hard to follow but it raises the question why some of them exist. A further example made is his #303 in which he chimed in about something but never had it go anywhere. I think that his push on LaLight is decent so I may retract these thoughts if Lalight is scum, and my read on Mush is more-so independent than anything.</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\n2. <div style=\"display:inline;color:#BF0000\">MarioManiac4</div><br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: </b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\">I don't really know where to start with Mario and I've been teetering about him for a while. I think he's been taking far too much time defending himself and the steps he's made after his whole debauchery about votes isn't impressive. I mentioned to Sheep how I felt it was losing it's charm but what's more impressive is how willing Mario was to drop it completely. Granted, people try different things all the time in order illicit responses, but why spend all that time building yourself as a proprietor of voting if it wasn't going to go anywhere in terms of scumhunting? There was seemingly no point to it all and I have retracted my feeling on early interaction because of this. I think Mario felt convicted to double-down but then dropped it because he started to get suspicion because of it, which doesn't look good.   This is furthered by a generally confusing priority from him such as #368 where he votes lalight and says he doesn't have many scumreads, and then hops off based on a single response from LaLight in #372. This doesn't make sense to me because in #146, he had LaLight as his strongest scumread and seemed to have enough to put players in brackets, though there isn't much to show as far why they are in there. Even now, Mario doesn't make a lot of sense to me and his explanations in #439 have a lot left to be desired, as I don't believe how long he continued to rant about votes was merely for RVS purposes, given he was still doing it by the time I would consider it over with.</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\n3. <div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF8000\">Cooperative Sheep</div><br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: </b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\">At a first glance, there's a lot to like about this slot, though I don't know if it's good enough. CooperativeSheep seems reasonable in one regard yet also has a certain vibe in his posts that bother me.

I don't think his reasoning on Ingeel was all that great and I am generally cautious of posts like #206 where sheep signals to vote with him without doing the dirty work, if that makes sense. Overall it feels like he is taking a bystander position instead of getting fully involved, and I'm not going to count his interaction with TwoFace because I thought it wasn't beneficial.

I think that his #348 is especially telling in this sense because I don't believe that LaLight would come after his own partner in the fashion he did. This is the second reason why I am advocating his lynch at this point, as it would clear up Mush more in my head; I don't think Mush/LaLight are a team.</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\n6. <div style=\"display:inline;color:#FFFF40\">iDanyBoy</div><br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: </b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\">I'm not really paying attention to this slot tbh.

I felt that MM4's vote on LaLight is more telling in a scum perspective because it felt like he was trying to allocate fake pressure on a partner as a means of distancing, though it never went anywhere.

Everyone has a certain playstyle but you cannot say with confidence that anyone who has a problem with you is purely based on your playstyle. Mafia wouldn't be all that great to play if any time you had a read on someone or a disagreement on the way they are presenting themselves, their arguments, or even demeanor, they simply said \"It's just my playstyle.\" A playstyle is not an excuse to deflect accusations, nor is it conductive or providing any insight further as to why you're innocent. I told you before that a lot of things you're saying are things scum could say, and I still stick to that. You'll find you will get a lot more out of people by not feeling you need to defend yourself in the way you play the game and justifying yourself and instead of choosing to be more productive and showing people why your arguments and way you are handling things is good. <br>\n<br>\nI have played with people with inherently anti-town playstyles who I can still manage to townread at the end of the day mostly because of the way they present their arguments.

This isn't just because he gave me a town pass but moreso I just believe that his laziness/ineffectiveness is not a staple of him being scum. It feels a bit rudimentary to talk in this way, but you could even say it's just a playstyle. I'm not really on the same page when it comes as to how you should read players but I believe understanding tone is important. Mush/Sheep, do you really think Mafia would be making statements like these if they were concerned about being lynched? I am not saying that scum can't play lazy or lurk, but what I got from Ingeel is that he's just a poor man's town who doesn't want to put the effort in, not a scum trying to skate along. I believe that more often than not, most scum will try and posture themselves and look as best as possible, unless somehow Ingeel is known for being lazy as scum and there's some kind of tell in that. Unfortunately, the people who know Ingeel all replaced out so I suppose I'll never know. <br>\n<br>\nThat being said, the whole posturing thing I was talking about is something that I bring up because I feel some players are doing it, more importantly Sheep. I don't have enough to warrant a vote nor make a concrete stance as of yet, but consider this a IGMEOY as I believe some of his posts feel very mechanical in how they are made, which is in contrast of Ingeel who I believe is not really thinking hard about what a good town does, therefore seems innocent.</div></blockquote>\nUsually I'm active but this feels so much like my newbie and it makes me not want to do shit<br>\n<br>\nI'm also seldom replying, trying to catch up while i can", "time": "Sun May 28, 2017 9:09 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=71908&start=675", "forum": "53", "thread": "71908"}

He tries to cast shade on Mario implying that his vote on LAL was serious and acting like it was suspicious he switched.

That imo is hiding due to fear. <br>\n<br>\nHe goes on and basically describes my play style to a tee and votes me but says he's not voting me for my play style <br>\n<br>\nHe asks me if I believe in LAL, I say yes, he says he doesn't believe me (btw I can prove I do) and I say \"well<br>\nThat's how I feel\" and he uses that against me in a negative light as well as adding some extra words to make what I said seem worse than it actually was.   <br>\n<br>\nHe never once takes the time to verify if I'm telling the truth which he could easily do if he searched past games. <br>\n<br>\nAnd now negative attention is being cast onto mush so he pops up, drops a vote without any reason and makes another excuse about being busy. <br>\n<br>\nAdding in the fact that he abandons his mush push to sheep mush on LaLight with the caveat that if LaLight flips town he's coming after mush instead of taking responsibility for his own actions.

If literally nothing can change your mind, you are not even willing to look at evidence. If you are Town, you are extremely confbiased (and indeed were when lynching Dragnalus). This is clearly anti-Town, as confbias only ends up leading Town on mislynch after mislynch, failing to consider evidence. The pot is calling the kettle black. If you are scum, this is easily believable as an attempt to push what you view as an easy misynch despite the claim.<br>\n<br>\nAlso, the roles together cannot be called broken if we have no idea what power roles Mafia has. Mafia very likely has a combination of Goons (which cannot be detected by Role Cops) and PRs (which can be detected by Role Cops but can weaken/negate Town PRs).

I call this depth because it's a pretty interesting interaction if she's scum here in that it doesn't really have an obvious agenda by it; she's not just white knighting him (or else there wouldn't be questioning) and she's not hedging on the wagon in the hopes that she's just going to join it when it matures (or else she wouldn't emphasize her townread to TwoFace) and while it's not completely impossible that scum accidentally fakes something like this and I'm suffering from \"reading way too much into this\" syndrome I think interactions like these are far more likely to come from town than scum.<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=9245771#p9245771\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=9245771#p9245771\" data-post-id=\"9245771\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 116</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=25801\">MarioManiac4</a> wrote:</cite>the reason I want people to vote is because it signifies your scumread, it applies pressure, it shows the trend of scumreads and allows you to come to a lynch conclusion, and there is no reason not to</div></blockquote>\nWant to emphasize my response here since your approach to voting vs. not voting is the thing that's resonating with me the most in the early game.<br>\nThis is bullshit. Votes - especially in early game - are very very close to useless. Your first argument is that votes signify your scumread, but, in RVS they absolutely don't - you can vote people for any reason you want in RVS and very often that reason has absolutely nothing to do with whether you scumread that player or not. What <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">actually</div> signifies your scumread is when you talk about it and give reasons for it - when TwoFace explained why he thought Drag's approach was scummy or when Syndesis talked about why she thought it wasn't or when Drag talked about thinking that Ingeel's response was off - these are the important and meaningful parts of the early game - not you voting Lalight or TwoFace voting Ingeel. Empty votes aren't pressure; empty votes aren't changing minds and empty votes aren't attracting other serious votes. When people bring up points, when people have reasons (or fool others into thinking they have reasons), that's when pressure happens.<br>\n<br>\nIf you are town here, then I am of the opinion (as of right this moment) that your early approach of the very two-dimensional push to vote derailed town off what was a fairly productive beginning (TwoFace was contributing early and your approach didn't hurt that but Syndesis and Drag were also contributing and you pretending like they weren't doing shit unless they were voting did discredit what they were doing) into something that was not so productive.<br>\n<br>\nMush's pair of <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9246238#p9246238\" class=\"postlink\">entry</a> <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9246250#p9246250\" class=\"postlink\">posts</a> come off as a bit awkward to me based on the language; things like \"maybe I still need to get used to this site's style of play, but that doesn't seem like a good reason\" come off as overly formal and thus fake.

First of all, you really have no idea what my scum play looks like if you think I'll let some townie get cleared with a 16-post ISO unless someone else is very convincingly spearheading the push for them to be town. When people don't post, they make themselves hilariously easy targets; as scum I would very easily be able to demonstrate an effort beyond a 16 post ISO and then I magically have a free lynch. Secondly, you aren't reading my posts properly if you thought that was a \"no hesitation townread\" and if you really do think that I'm a strong town player then I need you to read my posts and question me on them if you don't understand what I'm trying to get across.

But they would give some half arsed reads and push to wait until tomorrow to lynch them so they can prove themselves. There's no argument against it, and the fact that Nacho is the loudest against the wagon tells me that they can't be scum together, and therefore I see little resistance for the wagon.<br>\n<br>\nI don't buy you trying to say your reads otherwise you would, instead you was trying to push me to keep voting there.

If literally nothing can change your mind, you are not even willing to look at evidence. If you are Town, you are extremely confbiased (and indeed were when lynching Dragnalus). This is clearly anti-Town, as confbias only ends up leading Town on mislynch after mislynch, failing to consider evidence. The pot is calling the kettle black. If you are scum, this is easily believable as an attempt to push what you view as an easy misynch despite the claim.<br>\n<br>\nAlso, the roles together cannot be called broken if we have no idea what power roles Mafia has. Mafia very likely has a combination of Goons (which cannot be detected by Role Cops) and PRs (which can be detected by Role Cops but can weaken/negate Town PRs). This is like calling a claim broken just because the setup of PRs would be broken against a team of Goons, when in that case Mafia are highly likely to have PRs of their own.<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=9309377#p9309377\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=9309377#p9309377\" data-post-id=\"9309377\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 1274</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=28506\">TwoFace</a> wrote:</cite>Y'all will literally never change my mind.

{"number": 2298, "id": "9388551", "user": "MarioManiac4", "user_id": "25801", "content": "OK so MULCH.<br>\nMulch's actions were shit and didn't come from a town POV. QED.<br>\n<br>\nOK FOR REAL THOUGH<br>\nWhat Mulch basically did here was pick a target and stick to them. But when you read his ISO here, you won't see any reasoning that would cause this, you won't see anything of actual substance. I was Mulch's target. And because I was Mulch's target, Mulch never needed to scumhunt outside me. It's really that simple. Of course, what I initially thought was \"oh lol, confbiased stupid town\" but that isn't even it. I made an accurate observation at one point in my ISO; there was no way for him to get into the tunnel. All he did was, at some point in the game, decide \"lol mario is scum.\" What I'm saying is, there are certain ways town players get into tunnels, and this will usually involve scumreading someone, and then getting way too far into it, right? But this isn't what happened with Mulch. There was no natural progression at all. <br>\nEarlier, Mulch had shown the ability to reverse his opinion on people. He showed the ability to re-evaluate, he showed realistic read-flow. But when he began to \"tunnel\" me, that illusion came to a close. He stopped trying to read me- he started trying to scumread me. And you can see that as a constant throughout Mulch's ISO- once he begins to tunnel me, he never stops. He never thinks. Even after what he is doing has been explained, even after people have acknowledged how thoroughly crappy his tunnel was, he doesn't stop to re-evaluate. He never looks at my content. At one point, he posts a \"case.\" Of course, said case is utter bullshit and filled with artificial reasons to scumread me.<br>\nSo why does he do this? Because it worked. Once Mulch started to push hard, he got a positive reaction. So he went further into the tunnel. I, and others, continued to townread him for this, so he did it. He did it, because he knew he could get away with it. It was simple, but effective. He drowned the thread in his noise, worked with the player who was just as stubborn as he was pretending to be, and pushed a lynch on a player he wasn't even scumreading based upon some BS associations. <br>\nAnother thing that pings me extremely hard about Mulch is his self-defence. He pretends to be obvious town, and that's his casus belli for attacking those who scumread him. He gives \"reasons\" for this in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=9273204#p9273204\">955</a>- that \"everything he does is townie\", which, to be quite frank, is blatant bullshit, and he says that he \"doesn't care about opinions on him\"- which a) is blatant BS again, and b) doesn't even make you town. These are supposed to be reasons for Mulch being obvious town, but really all they ever were is excuses- they don't mean anything. Mulch hyper-played the VI card, but he just doesn't make any sense as a VI, and I don't believe this is his town game at all. To be honest, Large 203 (Scale of the Universe) looks a lot more similar.<br>\n<br>\nOh yeah- I don't think you guys ever lynch Dunker. Mush's replace out was extremely town-motivated when I look back on it. Let's face it- things were extremely bleak for town on D3. Mush's claim was basically apathy. He posted a few times, claiming \"uhhhh MM4 is scum guys\" without really engaging with anything. And then, he replaced out. By flaking. But this wasn't a genuine flake. Within the window when Frog was prodding/looking for replacement, Mush never posted, but he WAS online. He even changed his sig and added an avatar. That raises the distinct question- WHY would scum ever do that? This game looked to be about as easy as it could get. But Mush replaced out anyway. That's because his apathy was genuine, that's because Mush wanted to quit a losing game, that's because Mush was town. Dunker and I are the universal scumreads right now. The thread's getting pretty dull. Everyone's content with this. Perhaps if, today or more likely tomorrow, the focus moves to Nacho and Syn, the game will gain its spark.<br>\n<br>\nQuick reminder that Syndesis still hasn't given a reason for not shooting N1 and N2. There is literally no reason why you wouldn't do that as a Town 1-shot Vig. The reason she's not answering could be because she repeatedly missed it in her quest to not do any scumhunting whatsoever. But it's likely because she doesn't have an explanation, and knows that soon, I'll be dead. And it's SO convenient that the player who was shot just happened to be the Mafia who could kill themselves, especially when Syndesis wasn't even scumreading Vedith at all. Not to mention the fact that Syndesis has been doing literally no scumhunting for practically the entire game.<br>\n<br>\nOfc, it's unfortunate that Nacho can't really defend against this if he's town, because to the best of my knowledge Mulch isn't a Nacho alt. But right now, I'm thinking the team is Syndesis/Nacho.", "time": "Tue Jul 04, 2017 9:56 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=71908&start=2275", "forum": "53", "thread": "71908"}
