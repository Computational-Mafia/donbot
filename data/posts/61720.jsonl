With that said, you wanting to allow someone to RVS before we \"start\" is nonsense. BBT is a dirty Everton fan and nothing good can come from most of the things they say. Not to mention even if we did wait for their RVS's it's not something we can further the game state with and in all would only hold us up from progressing. Why are you trying to halt progression?"}

But I completely forgot about his farside-vote, wtf brain.. He still hasn't said anything about farside's response to that. I actually thought you wanted to vote for a claim and then see the reactions but now it doesn't look like that. <br>Anyway, there's a good chance I'll be revoting Kaboose but he can have a couple of hours to do something else than defending himself. <br><br>@Kaboose: You can read it in the gamethread. Monkey's post didn't look like it was posted for a PT, it looked like it was a response to something that was discussed in a PT but not yet in the main thread.

At that point I didn't mind Rev's vote because farside's first post felt like she was buddying Rev.<br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6832283#p6832283\">86</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6832340#p6832340\">93</a> felt town to me.<br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6832750#p6832750\">110</a> I think his thought on farside was a little farfetched here, but at the time I can get his Draynth-read. In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6833889#p6833889\">165</a> Rev explains a little more how he feels about farside missing questions.

But then she ends it with 'Am I going crazy' which to me feels sort of apologetic. She doesn't like how Rev is avoinding the wagon on a scumread of his, but farside has a scumread on Kaboose to but decides to vote Monkey instead. So she's kinda doing the same thing but it's scummy on Rev but not on her?<br><br>I really don't know what to think right now. I guess right now I'm most happy with a Kaboose lynch, but I could also go for Monkey.

She declared me town, and this happened to me before and both times the person saying it was town. So I'm inclined to believe Bella is town for this, also because scum will try to not have definite townreads, especially day 1, in my opinion.<br>I didn't like she first gave points to NM for declaring intent to hammer while Kaboose was at L-2, but when others are commenting on NM's hammerlove Bella thinks it's odd too. It's a little thing and I like Bella's other posts so I'll have her as a slight townread right now.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">BBT</span><br>Reason to vote: Kaboose voted farside for a slight lie while thinking her iso is pretty solid otherwise. <br>My read of BBT: I didn't much like how he only skimmed the game at first and joined a bandwagon without much consideration. It doesn't bother me though because I don't think scum would enter the game like that. BBT has been aggressively scumhunting so far, it looks like that to me at least. I think BBT is town.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Draynth</span><br>Reason to vote: It was weird for me, he first sorta kinda defends Kaboose but then votes anyway as he realises he's still RVS'ing (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6838074#p6838074\">244</a>) and thinks this is the scummiest case so far.<br>My read of Draynth: Besides his reason to vote, nothing is really pinging me on Draynth. Even though he sheeped hard, he seems to be understanding (and agreeing with) the reasons for lynching Kaboose. He's also engaging with several people and I think his thoughts are clear. I'ma put him down as a townread between slight and sure.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Monkey</span><br>Reason to vote: Believes BBT and Kaboose looks like scum.<br>My read of Monkey: I was very suspicious of him early game and it was hard to adjust my read on him. I just reread <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6832019#p6832019\">44</a> and I'm an idiot, I suddenly understand where he's coming from. What I don't really get is what happened to Monkeys scumread on BBT. He voted BBT earlier, then jumped to Dierfire (which felt weird to me because some time had passed already since Dierfire's accusation, so it didn't feel very genuine to me) and after Dierfire he sheeps BBT. But he doesn't mention BBT in between and doesn't engage with him, so what changed? He's posting regularly, posting his thoughts, but not in an elaborate way, and at times he gets defensive. The bolded FoS on Rev felt weird to me, and thinking about if scum is trying to get attention off the Kaboose-wagon, Monkeys FoS fits. Scumlean to me. <br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Wanderer</span><br>Reason to vote: Kaboose scumhunts the same way scum would build a case on town. I joined the bandwagon to get to a claim and see how others reacted to that (I didn't explain it in my original vote-post obviously) Also the fact that Kaboose never responded to farside's explanation after Kaboose's accusation didn't sit right with me. And there was also a language-thing that turned out to be a difference of interpretation. <br>My read of Wanderer: I'm actually mod-confirmed to myself^^ (yesyes, we all are, we all got role-pms, just smile (or roll eyes) and move on)<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Conclusion</span><br>As I said before the bandwagon feels like it's getting resistance, but because it was weekend I don't want to be too definite in this thought. I'd think scum would try to make cases on other townies trying to get a counterwagon going and there seem to be 2; on Rev and on Monkey (3 votes each) I'm still pretty convinced Kaboose is scum. I'm going to look into the CW's next.<br><br>An additional thought:<br>Reverend had his vote on Kaboose for a short while as well after Kaboose voted farside. That was a reason for Rev to think farside was actually town. I'll reference you to my <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6843473#p6843473\">360</a> for my thoughts on Reverend. I realize this was posted quite some time ago, and I haven't responded to Rev's <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6846243#p6846243\">429</a> yet (he answer some questions I asked, among other things) and Rev's iso grew twice as large since I made that post, so need to take another look at Rev but he's on a CW so that'll happen when I inspect those.<br><br>And another:<br>Not-Mafia to me looks like he is trying to prevent a claim by declaring intent to hammer at L-2, and he also said he'd probably hammer pending a claim. That prevents any reads of reactions to that claim and that's scummy in my opinion. <br>Kaboose is basically at L-1 with this intent to hammer, so I'd like him to claim now.<br><br>PEdit: Kaboose posted while I wrote this, gonna go ahead and post this and then read his post."}

He ignored his own suspicions to vote for Skold on the basis of Bella's case. Then he returns his vote to the Rev wagon, bringing him to L-1 without posting a warning. Why? Monkey says that he has been suspicious of Rev all game, but he didn't really talk through that read or what Rev had done to make him a better vote than Skold (I'm assuming that it was something that Rev did or said because Skold hadn't posted in that time).<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">@Monkey</span><br>Why is Rev a better vote than Skold now if he wasn't before (when you moved your vote from Rev to Skold)?<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">@Farside</span><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6871258#p6871258\" class=\"postlink\">post 759</a>, farside22 wrote:</cite><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: skold</span><br><br>I'm noting that since Bella's case he just agreed with parts and then disappeared during the argument between rev and myself.</div></blockquote><br><br>What makes Skold a better vote than Monkey?<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">@Wanderer</span><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6874145#p6874145\" class=\"postlink\">post 782</a>, Wanderer-nl wrote:</cite>Lurker-Skold = scum.<br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Skold</span><br><br>(Taking some time off from farside and Rev, I just want to catch scum today. 9p left, lynch today is 8p left, 2 kills is 6p tomorrow.

That's an honest assessment, or perhaps scum being very good at putting himself in town shoes. I don't see any of this from you or farside. That's because neither of you are actually looking for reasons for me to be town. That's more damning in farside's case due to the fact she has nothing to say about me failing to fakeclaim a cop guilty on her at L-1. But you monkey, your motive seems to be to discredit me and my reads. I mean if you were town who thought I might be town, well you'd maybe start to think I could know something about farside that you don't. That isn't what's happening though.

We discussed the Kaboose wagon for a bit which is what really convinced me that Wanderer was Town. Unfortunately Kaboose dropped a hammer on himself before any of the analysis became relevant but Wanderer was really looking analytically at the game and, importantly, there's no way that Wanderer would have known that Kaboose would do that--so there would be no reason to remove her vote and spend time trying to crack the game instead of pushing Kaboose.<br>On Day Two we both struggled to make sense of the interaction between Rev and Farside.

Unfortunately Kaboose dropped a hammer on himself before any of the analysis became relevant but Wanderer was really looking analytically at the game and, importantly, there's no way that Wanderer would have known that Kaboose would do that--so there would be no reason to remove her vote and spend time trying to crack the game instead of pushing Kaboose.<br>On Day Two we both struggled to make sense of the interaction between Rev and Farside.

In an earlier post you were convinced farside was town because Kaboose jumped on her and later you think they're scumbuddies because farside isn't responding to Kaboose at all, so how is your scumread on farside stronger than on Kaboose?<br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6840589#p6840589\">311</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6840629#p6840629\">314</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6840647#p6840647\">316</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6840652#p6840652\">317</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6840699#p6840699\">319</a> I agree with these, but they're not allignment indicative.<br>And that was all. <br><br>Farside starts to look town to me from <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6839094#p6839094\">289</a>, and I really liked her <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6842433#p6842433\">345</a>, because she notices Rev and Monkey haven't really interacted. But then she ends it with 'Am I going crazy' which to me feels sort of apologetic. She doesn't like how Rev is avoinding the wagon on a scumread of his, but farside has a scumread on Kaboose to but decides to vote Monkey instead. So she's kinda doing the same thing but it's scummy on Rev but not on her?<br><br>I really don't know what to think right now. I guess right now I'm most happy with a Kaboose lynch, but I could also go for Monkey. I'm now null on Rev and farside, I'm hoping a flip will tell me more about them.<br><br><div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: PEdit:</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display: none;\">@Dierfire: Hehe, really?

She declared me town, and this happened to me before and both times the person saying it was town. So I'm inclined to believe Bella is town for this, also because scum will try to not have definite townreads, especially day 1, in my opinion.<br>I didn't like she first gave points to NM for declaring intent to hammer while Kaboose was at L-2, but when others are commenting on NM's hammerlove Bella thinks it's odd too. It's a little thing and I like Bella's other posts so I'll have her as a slight townread right now.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">BBT</span><br>Reason to vote: Kaboose voted farside for a slight lie while thinking her iso is pretty solid otherwise. <br>My read of BBT: I didn't much like how he only skimmed the game at first and joined a bandwagon without much consideration. It doesn't bother me though because I don't think scum would enter the game like that. BBT has been aggressively scumhunting so far, it looks like that to me at least. I think BBT is town.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Draynth</span><br>Reason to vote: It was weird for me, he first sorta kinda defends Kaboose but then votes anyway as he realises he's still RVS'ing (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6838074#p6838074\">244</a>) and thinks this is the scummiest case so far.<br>My read of Draynth: Besides his reason to vote, nothing is really pinging me on Draynth. Even though he sheeped hard, he seems to be understanding (and agreeing with) the reasons for lynching Kaboose. He's also engaging with several people and I think his thoughts are clear. I'ma put him down as a townread between slight and sure.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Monkey</span><br>Reason to vote: Believes BBT and Kaboose looks like scum.<br>My read of Monkey: I was very suspicious of him early game and it was hard to adjust my read on him. I just reread <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6832019#p6832019\">44</a> and I'm an idiot, I suddenly understand where he's coming from. What I don't really get is what happened to Monkeys scumread on BBT. He voted BBT earlier, then jumped to Dierfire (which felt weird to me because some time had passed already since Dierfire's accusation, so it didn't feel very genuine to me) and after Dierfire he sheeps BBT. But he doesn't mention BBT in between and doesn't engage with him, so what changed? He's posting regularly, posting his thoughts, but not in an elaborate way, and at times he gets defensive. The bolded FoS on Rev felt weird to me, and thinking about if scum is trying to get attention off the Kaboose-wagon, Monkeys FoS fits. Scumlean to me. <br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Wanderer</span><br>Reason to vote: Kaboose scumhunts the same way scum would build a case on town. I joined the bandwagon to get to a claim and see how others reacted to that (I didn't explain it in my original vote-post obviously) Also the fact that Kaboose never responded to farside's explanation after Kaboose's accusation didn't sit right with me. And there was also a language-thing that turned out to be a difference of interpretation. <br>My read of Wanderer: I'm actually mod-confirmed to myself^^ (yesyes, we all are, we all got role-pms, just smile (or roll eyes) and move on)<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Conclusion</span><br>As I said before the bandwagon feels like it's getting resistance, but because it was weekend I don't want to be too definite in this thought. I'd think scum would try to make cases on other townies trying to get a counterwagon going and there seem to be 2; on Rev and on Monkey (3 votes each) I'm still pretty convinced Kaboose is scum. I'm going to look into the CW's next.<br><br>An additional thought:<br>Reverend had his vote on Kaboose for a short while as well after Kaboose voted farside. That was a reason for Rev to think farside was actually town. I'll reference you to my <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6843473#p6843473\">360</a> for my thoughts on Reverend. I realize this was posted quite some time ago, and I haven't responded to Rev's <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6846243#p6846243\">429</a> yet (he answer some questions I asked, among other things) and Rev's iso grew twice as large since I made that post, so need to take another look at Rev but he's on a CW so that'll happen when I inspect those.<br><br>And another:<br>Not-Mafia to me looks like he is trying to prevent a claim by declaring intent to hammer at L-2, and he also said he'd probably hammer pending a claim. That prevents any reads of reactions to that claim and that's scummy in my opinion. <br>Kaboose is basically at L-1 with this intent to hammer, so I'd like him to claim now.<br><br>PEdit: Kaboose posted while I wrote this, gonna go ahead and post this and then read his post.</div></blockquote><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6848769#p6848769\" class=\"postlink\">post 512</a>, Wanderer-nl wrote:</cite>Okay, I'm actually confused now and need to think.<br>My <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6846532#p6846532\">492</a>, what if scum is trying this with a buddy? NM looks pretty scummy for wanting to hammer before a claim.

It wouldn't have been so fun if I was wrong! That farside read is the most confident scum read I've had in a long, long time. I can see how that would utterly frustrate the hell out of farside who was probably hoping she could use her experience with me to fool me. And yeah the mod is bang on, my reads were dynamite here but my delivery not so sharp. My apologies to anyone who got pissed off with me, I hope you can at least see that there's a point to my madness.<br><br>I made one crucial oversight in all of this, and that was the score after I got NK'd - it was lylo, which meant even I wasn't certain farside was scum after I died. I mean I was still scumreading the shit out of her, but it would also make sense for a non-farside scum team to NK me there. I should've crunched the numbers because in hindsight it was a huge risk that could've backfired horribly if farside was town.<br><br>Still, I'm very pleased that the town had the skill to see this one through. I don't think I was getting to bella. There was reason for concern as I battled farside, but ultimately I had her as town until PoE started to bite. Scum are a little unlucky in that respect but overall I think this was well deserved by town. <br><br>Thanks to psyche for modding, and to everyone else for tolerating me!"}
