She doesn't like how Rev is avoinding the wagon on a scumread of his, but farside has a scumread on Kaboose to but decides to vote Monkey instead.

She declared me town, and this happened to me before and both times the person saying it was town. So I'm inclined to believe Bella is town for this, also because scum will try to not have definite townreads, especially day 1, in my opinion.<br>\nI didn't like she first gave points to NM for declaring intent to hammer while Kaboose was at L-2, but when others are commenting on NM's hammerlove Bella thinks it's odd too. It's a little thing and I like Bella's other posts so I'll have her as a slight townread right now.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">BBT</div><br>\nReason to vote: Kaboose voted farside for a slight lie while thinking her iso is pretty solid otherwise. <br>\nMy read of BBT: I didn't much like how he only skimmed the game at first and joined a bandwagon without much consideration. It doesn't bother me though because I don't think scum would enter the game like that. BBT has been aggressively scumhunting so far, it looks like that to me at least. I think BBT is town.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Draynth</div><br>\nReason to vote: It was weird for me, he first sorta kinda defends Kaboose but then votes anyway as he realises he's still RVS'ing (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6838074#p6838074\">244</a>) and thinks this is the scummiest case so far.<br>\nMy read of Draynth: Besides his reason to vote, nothing is really pinging me on Draynth. Even though he sheeped hard, he seems to be understanding (and agreeing with) the reasons for lynching Kaboose. He's also engaging with several people and I think his thoughts are clear. I'ma put him down as a townread between slight and sure.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Monkey</div><br>\nReason to vote: Believes BBT and Kaboose looks like scum.<br>\nMy read of Monkey: I was very suspicious of him early game and it was hard to adjust my read on him. I just reread <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6832019#p6832019\">44</a> and I'm an idiot, I suddenly understand where he's coming from. What I don't really get is what happened to Monkeys scumread on BBT. He voted BBT earlier, then jumped to Dierfire (which felt weird to me because some time had passed already since Dierfire's accusation, so it didn't feel very genuine to me) and after Dierfire he sheeps BBT. But he doesn't mention BBT in between and doesn't engage with him, so what changed? He's posting regularly, posting his thoughts, but not in an elaborate way, and at times he gets defensive. The bolded FoS on Rev felt weird to me, and thinking about if scum is trying to get attention off the Kaboose-wagon, Monkeys FoS fits. Scumlean to me. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Wanderer</div><br>\nReason to vote: Kaboose scumhunts the same way scum would build a case on town. I joined the bandwagon to get to a claim and see how others reacted to that (I didn't explain it in my original vote-post obviously) Also the fact that Kaboose never responded to farside's explanation after Kaboose's accusation didn't sit right with me. And there was also a language-thing that turned out to be a difference of interpretation. <br>\nMy read of Wanderer: I'm actually mod-confirmed to myself^^ (yesyes, we all are, we all got role-pms, just smile (or roll eyes) and move on)<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Conclusion</div><br>\nAs I said before the bandwagon feels like it's getting resistance, but because it was weekend I don't want to be too definite in this thought. I'd think scum would try to make cases on other townies trying to get a counterwagon going and there seem to be 2; on Rev and on Monkey (3 votes each) I'm still pretty convinced Kaboose is scum. I'm going to look into the CW's next.<br>\n<br>\nAn additional thought:<br>\nReverend had his vote on Kaboose for a short while as well after Kaboose voted farside. That was a reason for Rev to think farside was actually town. I'll reference you to my <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6843473#p6843473\">360</a> for my thoughts on Reverend. I realize this was posted quite some time ago, and I haven't responded to Rev's <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6846243#p6846243\">429</a> yet (he answer some questions I asked, among other things) and Rev's iso grew twice as large since I made that post, so need to take another look at Rev but he's on a CW so that'll happen when I inspect those.<br>\n<br>\nAnd another:<br>\nNot-Mafia to me looks like he is trying to prevent a claim by declaring intent to hammer at L-2, and he also said he'd probably hammer pending a claim. That prevents any reads of reactions to that claim and that's scummy in my opinion. <br>\nKaboose is basically at L-1 with this intent to hammer, so I'd like him to claim now.<br>\n<br>\nPEdit: Kaboose posted while I wrote this, gonna go ahead and post this and then read his post.", "time": "Mon May 11, 2015 12:14 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=61720&start=500", "forum": "53", "thread": "61720"}

First, Monkey was thinking that Farside and Rev were not both on the same team and expressed suspicion of Farside specifically (although I just remembered that he had been voting for Rev between <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6861252#p6861252\">Post 610</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6864464#p6864464\">Post 682</a>, which only makes that stranger). He ignored his own suspicions to vote for Skold on the basis of Bella's case. Then he returns his vote to the Rev wagon, bringing him to L-1 without posting a warning. Why? Monkey says that he has been suspicious of Rev all game, but he didn't really talk through that read or what Rev had done to make him a better vote than Skold (I'm assuming that it was something that Rev did or said because Skold hadn't posted in that time).<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">@Monkey</div><br>\nWhy is Rev a better vote than Skold now if he wasn't before (when you moved your vote from Rev to Skold)?<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">@Farside</div><br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6871258#p6871258\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6871258#p6871258\" data-post-id=\"6871258\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 759</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=8269\">farside22</a> wrote:</cite><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: skold</div><br>\n<br>\nI'm noting that since Bella's case he just agreed with parts and then disappeared during the argument between rev and myself.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nWhat makes Skold a better vote than Monkey?<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">@Wanderer</div><br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6874145#p6874145\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6874145#p6874145\" data-post-id=\"6874145\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 782</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=25510\">Wanderer-nl</a> wrote:</cite>Lurker-Skold = scum.<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Skold</span><br>\n<br>\n(Taking some time off from farside and Rev, I just want to catch scum today. 9p left, lynch today is 8p left, 2 kills is 6p tomorrow.

On Day One I was pushing Rev in the neighborhood as well as the main thread, while Wanderer was less convinced. We discussed the Kaboose wagon for a bit which is what really convinced me that Wanderer was Town. Unfortunately Kaboose dropped a hammer on himself before any of the analysis became relevant but Wanderer was really looking analytically at the game and, importantly, there's no way that Wanderer would have known that Kaboose would do that--so there would be no reason to remove her vote and spend time trying to crack the game instead of pushing Kaboose.<br>\nOn Day Two we both struggled to make sense of the interaction between Rev and Farside. Wanderer ended up being more suspicious of Rev than I was, I think, but the quick hammer from Monkey cut that discussion off (and I was busy with work during the end of Day Two and beginning of Night Two).<br>\n<br>\nMy best guess for the Mafia--pending Flubber's claim--is Bella, Farside, and Monkey.<br>\n<br>\n---<br>\nEDIT<br>\nI'll let Wanderer answer Farside's question but by POE I'm down to the team above.<br>\nIn answer to NM: if you and Flubber are Town, and I am Town, and Wanderer is Town, and we are in LYLO, then Bella must be Mafia.

On Day One I was pushing Rev in the neighborhood as well as the main thread, while Wanderer was less convinced. We discussed the Kaboose wagon for a bit which is what really convinced me that Wanderer was Town. Unfortunately Kaboose dropped a hammer on himself before any of the analysis became relevant but Wanderer was really looking analytically at the game and, importantly, there's no way that Wanderer would have known that Kaboose would do that--so there would be no reason to remove her vote and spend time trying to crack the game instead of pushing Kaboose.<br>\nOn Day Two we both struggled to make sense of the interaction between Rev and Farside.

But then she ends it with 'Am I going crazy' which to me feels sort of apologetic. She doesn't like how Rev is avoinding the wagon on a scumread of his, but farside has a scumread on Kaboose to but decides to vote Monkey instead. So she's kinda doing the same thing but it's scummy on Rev but not on her?<br>\n<br>\nI really don't know what to think right now. I guess right now I'm most happy with a Kaboose lynch, but I could also go for Monkey.

It doesn't bother me though because I don't think scum would enter the game like that. BBT has been aggressively scumhunting so far, it looks like that to me at least. I think BBT is town.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Draynth</div><br>\nReason to vote: It was weird for me, he first sorta kinda defends Kaboose but then votes anyway as he realises he's still RVS'ing (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6838074#p6838074\">244</a>) and thinks this is the scummiest case so far.<br>\nMy read of Draynth: Besides his reason to vote, nothing is really pinging me on Draynth. Even though he sheeped hard, he seems to be understanding (and agreeing with) the reasons for lynching Kaboose. He's also engaging with several people and I think his thoughts are clear. I'ma put him down as a townread between slight and sure.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Monkey</div><br>\nReason to vote: Believes BBT and Kaboose looks like scum.<br>\nMy read of Monkey: I was very suspicious of him early game and it was hard to adjust my read on him. I just reread <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6832019#p6832019\">44</a> and I'm an idiot, I suddenly understand where he's coming from. What I don't really get is what happened to Monkeys scumread on BBT. He voted BBT earlier, then jumped to Dierfire (which felt weird to me because some time had passed already since Dierfire's accusation, so it didn't feel very genuine to me) and after Dierfire he sheeps BBT. But he doesn't mention BBT in between and doesn't engage with him, so what changed? He's posting regularly, posting his thoughts, but not in an elaborate way, and at times he gets defensive. The bolded FoS on Rev felt weird to me, and thinking about if scum is trying to get attention off the Kaboose-wagon, Monkeys FoS fits. Scumlean to me. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Wanderer</div><br>\nReason to vote: Kaboose scumhunts the same way scum would build a case on town. I joined the bandwagon to get to a claim and see how others reacted to that (I didn't explain it in my original vote-post obviously) Also the fact that Kaboose never responded to farside's explanation after Kaboose's accusation didn't sit right with me. And there was also a language-thing that turned out to be a difference of interpretation. <br>\nMy read of Wanderer: I'm actually mod-confirmed to myself^^ (yesyes, we all are, we all got role-pms, just smile (or roll eyes) and move on)<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Conclusion</div><br>\nAs I said before the bandwagon feels like it's getting resistance, but because it was weekend I don't want to be too definite in this thought. I'd think scum would try to make cases on other townies trying to get a counterwagon going and there seem to be 2; on Rev and on Monkey (3 votes each) I'm still pretty convinced Kaboose is scum. I'm going to look into the CW's next.<br>\n<br>\nAn additional thought:<br>\nReverend had his vote on Kaboose for a short while as well after Kaboose voted farside. That was a reason for Rev to think farside was actually town. I'll reference you to my <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6843473#p6843473\">360</a> for my thoughts on Reverend. I realize this was posted quite some time ago, and I haven't responded to Rev's <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6846243#p6846243\">429</a> yet (he answer some questions I asked, among other things) and Rev's iso grew twice as large since I made that post, so need to take another look at Rev but he's on a CW so that'll happen when I inspect those.<br>\n<br>\nAnd another:<br>\nNot-Mafia to me looks like he is trying to prevent a claim by declaring intent to hammer at L-2, and he also said he'd probably hammer pending a claim. That prevents any reads of reactions to that claim and that's scummy in my opinion. <br>\nKaboose is basically at L-1 with this intent to hammer, so I'd like him to claim now.<br>\n<br>\nPEdit: Kaboose posted while I wrote this, gonna go ahead and post this and then read his post.</div></blockquote><br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6848769#p6848769\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6848769#p6848769\" data-post-id=\"6848769\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 512</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=25510\">Wanderer-nl</a> wrote:</cite>Okay, I'm actually confused now and need to think.<br>\nMy <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6846532#p6846532\">492</a>, what if scum is trying this with a buddy?
