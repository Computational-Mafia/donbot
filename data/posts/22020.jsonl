Roles with Night actions will not be able to submit an action on Night 0 (i.e. during the confirmation stage).<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Voting, Deadlines, and Death</span><br>6.

Upon receiving a third prod, a player will be replaced.<br>14. Players may declare V/LA if they expect to be unable to post for a period of time. Either PM the moderator or post in bold.<br>15.

So, in your 4 pages of summary you call out Seacore as significant, but that is super vague in itself. Explain with alignments please. <br>2. Explain your Coffee and Roflcopter town reads.<br><br>@With regards to Aragula/Seacore/Humble on page 3-4. <br>Defending a person is legitimate. It's not the same as \"disrupting an attack\"/scum hunting in a way that you two can't do it on Absta. The reasoning is legitimated in Aragula's response since part of the game is to defend your town reads and steer town towards your scum reads. I dislike Humble's argument on Aragula because it frames it the wrong way. Especially given the context that we just had a long weekend. Like wise with Seacore. <br><br>The current argument/\"case\" on absta is still awaiting a response especially with the new questions from Humble. Let it develop. Make the calls then. Both Seacore/Humble remain as a town read due to obv actions.

I have bad feels from the Seacore commentary that Senfan did. The vagueness of it all is scummy to me since mentioning people who are significant in events without personal opinions feels like someone trying to get a name stuck out there to gauge opinion. That and off page 1 and 4 it's my best scum read so far. :&lt;. <br><br>I'll look more into the other stuff after my labwork. <br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"> Unvote, Vote Sensfan </span>."}

Sorry for the lateness since work and soreness from the gym and all.<br><br>@Milk/Thomith Page 2-3 Stuffs.<br>It took a few rereads but looking at Milk's POV: The vote and the RQS statement are independent things. It took me a few re-reads but there seems to be some blending of both RQS arguments with the votes assuming you take Milk's side. I can agree on a theory standpoint how <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4055237#p4055237\" class=\"postlink\">how RQS is not scummy but makes Milk view their play differently.</a> These cues are best used for meta - alignment link analysis.<br><br>I'm ok for the stance that RQS is fluffy (hence my original post this game) which leads to fruitless advances. I'm ok with Milk's reasoning with player trend analysis. But otherwise I find these pages more about mafia theory and less about actual interactions. It doesn't seem to be a strong argument for this early case. <br><br>However I dislike Thomith's followup to his Milk vote. Particularly the \"cautious\" reasoning of Mormon. I was fine with him following a person's case if he felt that it's a good one. I'm not fine when Thomith's Mormon analysis because to me when I read between the lines it doesn't seem like a person should be convinced by a cautious person's vote. If a person has a good case I would be more suspect of the lack of voting (i.e Mormon) because this could be an early bus attack link (i.e Mormon-bork) or something fishy like that. Seeing how Thomith admitted that there should be doubt in Mormon's character I see this more of someone latching on to a case in a lazy manner, which is scummy in my eyes.<br><br>@Mormon<br><a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4058708#p4058708\" class=\"postlink\">This post is scummy to me</a>. Mainly because caution at this stage of the game shouldn't be an issue with exception to L-1 quick votes. Which it in self is informative. For a game of this caliber I expect town to be more competent to avoid quick hammers. Thus if a quick hammer occured on an early day 1 wagon, we actually narrow down the pool for scum targets (or should be able to) since only scum would push a wagon so fast.<br><br>Like wise if we do run up a powerrole, the need to claim isn't present for this stage of the game. That person won't be lynched because I expect town to recognize the context of the wagon (i.e. early day 1). <br><br>Finally if we do have town that sheep wagons like so, we have more serious problems then outing PRs since our day play would be severely compromised due to player style in game rather then any other repercussions of losing PRs. In other words scum would play to be the leaders of this kind of crowd since that's far stronger then lynching PRs. <br><br>So this comment pings on my scumdar for the above reasons. Caution at this stage really isn't necessary for competent town. Reaction tells garnered by this phase will set up a solid foundation for future reads and the later phases. <br><br>@URoE<br>Town read for the following reasons:<br>a.

You're trying to shift the conversation out of your own scummyness (your smear posts) and put everything into DTMaster's guess of a scumteam (And discrediting him for it).<br><br>And the fun fact, is that you keep throwing these subtle smears at anyone who attacks you.

If you think he is scum, why be worried about his reasoning? You'd just dismiss it if faulty.  The \"worry\" seemed to be an implication that you were unsure of his alignment.  At least, that's my interpretation. (preview edit: Considering you're claiming to be unsure of his alignment this might be excusable)<br><br>When did he call you neighbour?  Can you stop saying neighbour for everything?  Try and define clearly what you're saying.  If you're accusing DTMaster and me of being in a scumteam, say so.  If you're implying someone has the role neighbour, say it.  If you're implying people are acting too friendly to each other, phrase it in an unambiguous way.  <span style=\"font-style: italic\">\"Buddying up to someone\"</span> is a good expression for that.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>There is some serious neighbouring going on between DT and Poirot, smells pretty fishy!!  </div></blockquote><br><strike>Again, this is the type of mild accusations that scum usually makes.

You're trying to shift the conversation out of your own scummyness (your smear posts) and put everything into DTMaster's guess of a scumteam (And discrediting him for it).<br><br>And the fun fact, is that you keep throwing these subtle smears at anyone who attacks you.  Right now, it's me.  You're telling me I'm directing DTMaster on how to slip under the radar.  That's an implication that I'm scum with DTMaster. Yet, you don't outright say it.

If you think he is scum, why be worried about his reasoning? You'd just dismiss it if faulty.  The \"worry\" seemed to be an implication that you were unsure of his alignment.  At least, that's my interpretation. (preview edit: Considering you're claiming to be unsure of his alignment this might be excusable)<br><br>When did he call you neighbour?  Can you stop saying neighbour for everything?  Try and define clearly what you're saying.  If you're accusing DTMaster and me of being in a scumteam, say so.  If you're implying someone has the role neighbour, say it.  If you're implying people are acting too friendly to each other, phrase it in an unambiguous way.  <span style=\"font-style: italic\">\"Buddying up to someone\"</span> is a good expression for that.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>There is some serious neighbouring going on between DT and Poirot, smells pretty fishy!!  </div></blockquote><br><strike>Again, this is the type of mild accusations that scum usually makes.

I accused you of bias, which isn't me guessing your alignment, its saying STOP BEING BIASED.<br>2. I was referring to the fact that DT seemed to be doing that to me, not the other way around. Again, bias.<br>3. It's more than excusable, because I didn't assume DT's alignment and you know it.<br>4. Fine, said we were both mafia. Neighbour is an easy way of summing up DT's case that me and rofl are scumbuddies together. In terms of my neighbour comment about you and DT, not sure why everyone didn't pick up on the sarcasm, but if everyone is assuming I wasn't, I fail to see why I haven't been lynched yet. This game worries me already and I can't see town winning, and that's from D1. You seemed to be buddying with DT, yes, but that doesn't mean I was suggesting you were scum; I was appealing to you to consider both arguments rather than pigeon hole me. To be honest I have the inclination that a D1 flip from me might make this game move back on track, but at this point I can see you and DT turning around and saying \"well, it was clear Techno was acting scummy, so we did what we had to do. He only has himself to blame for being lynched\"<br><br>Stop and consider what you are doing before more misinformed voters and scummers pop out of the woodwork and jump me, and also destroy any case that my townflip could shed any light on who is actually scum and advance town rather than being a horrible waste of mislynching time."}

You seem town in your intent and scumhunting, yet at the same time your buddying + bias towards me had me thinking you might be scum, but nothing telling yet. You seem somewhat town to me, particularly after your last post. I understand why you might think I was 'smearing' plus my initial post on DT and rofl was pretty lazy, but I felt your riding of me was not relational to what I had said and you were reading far into my supposed 'motivations'. At the same time I felt you weren't doing the same for DT, and in fact quite the opposite; you were defending his scummy actions and even giving pointers as to how to react to me. That didn't necessarily make me think you were scum, just that you skewed in your thinking. My initial read on DT and subsequent post was merely a vibe read, since he rambled a lot and seemed nervous; I've never played with DT and I felt entitled to say this without any need to back it up, because it wasn't as if I was on a scumhunt rampage to nail his arse. It was just a vibe, and I don't play by vibes, but I certainly look into them.<br><br>DT's response to me seemed to suggest my initial vibe on him was wrong, but his claim that 'I was likely scum, and therefore rofl was too simply by association' just seemed like scum on the attack. I'm not sure why you didn't feel this was, yet me pointing out how scummy it was makes me scum?<br><br>@ Arugula: Not on purpose, I remember you not liking your name being spelt wrong but I actually thought I had the right spelling, and 'u' was the wrong one. I didn't ask you to reply, I said I was going to reply to you. Fair enough that maybe my sarcasm wasn't obvious, but your initial response read to me as 'just looked at the last post, didn't read the rest of the argument'. And now again more bias, when I am getting jumped on for suspecting a link (which, I might add, has now been affirmed and my suspicions were correct) between Humble/DT. Yet I never was adamant they were scum together, or that there link was any more than an ingame one, or even adamant at all, I simply suggested it. But DT on the other hand MAKES CLAIM I AND ROFL ARE SCUM BUDDIES FROM ONE POST, and he gets nothing. Not even a slap on the wrist. Just 'oh no mister good towny, you shouldn't say that'. My point exactly about the dangers of alliances.<br><br>@Thomith: By sheer maths, no more than one, but a good chance there is one. Yet one amongst four is enough to be a serious issue; and there is still every possibility, even if unlikely, that there is more. But again the problem then comes when, say for instance, DT flips scum and then we consider 'well, according to the maths the rest of them are town'. No, the point is, EVERYONE should be suspect because we have no idea. Heck, all four of them could be scum, or none, but we should assume nothing, and therefore, make no alliances. Unbiased, everyone suspect, anyone potential for scum and therefore a lynch. NEVER assume."}

Put it this way; if I was scum and everyone was starting up an alliance, I'd probably jump at the chance, even if it meant killing off all my scumbuddies until I was the only one left midgame.

It's like roflcopter's bold \"if X is scum Y is scum\".  Many players do that sort of thing but don't actually believe it with emphasis.  <br><br>You get town points in my book for being consistent with what you believe in.

Just when I was starting to like you.  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\"><br><br>Give me the benefit of the doubt, will you?  You've admitted your own post was lazy (I still believe it has all the components of smear although I now believe you're likely town and so is DT who has done barely anything scummy in my eyes.

Yeah, gimme a sec to isolate exactly what you said that bugged me and I will post it in my next post, I'm still having issues scrolling through text and isolating parts of it through all the command jargon <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\"> Basically though I felt you were picking on me for all the things DT was doing too. I found some of your points on me valid, but blown out of proportion. However, they applied to DT more, I thought. Smear campaign against me (and he was planning more with his '1v1' and 'walls of quotes' threat at me) which was something you accused me of doing, bad scumhunting (my initial post was lazy and based off vibes, because I hadn't read enough of the post but I still wanted to reply when asked, and so I gave my reads based off my vibes at the time) which was a fair point to make about my initial post, I agree; but DT's later assertions of me and rofl were much much worse, and you, assuming he was town, just told him he shouldn't do it rather than 'hang on a minute; is this guy for real?'. No one STILL has pointed out his case on me about rofl and I have asked a million times, and I am the only one pulling him up for it.<br>2. I regretted saying that after I posted. Bias I won't take back, because I still feel you were, but since then you've looked at it more critically and me saying you were short-sighted was probably uncalled for. I just had no other way of conveying my frustration. Even before I made that post you seemed to be analysing the situation in a very unbiased manner and I didn't take that into account when I wrote that comment, I just gave in to my frustrations, so I apologise.<br><br>I understand yours and Seacore's points that DT may have just been aggro town and there was nothing scummy in his approach, and this may be true. I am eager to hear back from DT on the matter. I still want to know what his case was on me and rofl not responding to each other as that was the crux of the entire debate, and at the moment I still have my reservations about his 'perceived towniness' by everyone else. If anyone else knows what he was referring to it would be helpful to let me know."}

You had nothing to say about me until I put you on my scumdar </div></blockquote><br>There are many things are wrong with this argument.<br>1. You still fail to understand what OMGUS means. I will go into lecture smug mode now. Allow me to refer to the Wikipedia good sir.<br><blockquote><div><cite>MafiaWiki wrote:</cite>OMGUS stands for \"Oh My God, You Suck (for voting for me)!\". it is sometimes used as a shorthand to indicate that you are voting for someone primarily because they voted for you.</div></blockquote><br>With this as an example: <br><blockquote><div><cite>Mafiawiki wrote:</cite>The term was introduced by GL mafia player Purgation in GL mafia game 29 on 08-12-2001 04:13 AM. The sequence of posts went as follows:<br><br>Ryoushi: I am going to Vote: Purgation because I don't like any of the other bandwagons.<br><br>Purgation: OMG, you suck. Vote Ryoushi.<br><br>Ryoushi: I didn't expect that kind of response, though...</div></blockquote><br><br>Ignoring the vote because that's not required for the basis of your attack (that and it's more so a semantic of the argument if I go down that road which is distracting in general) this is not how I attacked you. Did I attack you for calling me out? No. I acknowledged your original attack because it's valid. See this exchange:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Techno wrote:</cite>2. DT: he seems twitchy and nervous.</div></blockquote><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>DTM wrote:</cite>a. Twitchy? I'm impressed that you could see my physical body writhing awkwardly from some text on an internet forum. (/bad joke) That aside I'm confused to why the scum read in particular. Details please.</div></blockquote><br><br><br>Details fleshed out by you are fine (with regards to posting style as an argument to my alignment). I take that hit. OMGUS attacks? I think not. Please recall the original argument:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>DTM wrote:</cite> Aside from that I noticed a scummy activity. You failed to follow up on Roflcopter . Between your Post 63 here to Roflcopter's post of questions on page 4 here and yourresponse here later that day I noticed you failed to follow up on your very own scum case . Townies care about their own cases. Townies don't forget when someone fails to answer the question. This is scummy since you didn't follow up on your own case.</div></blockquote><br><br><br>Key words are: \"failed to follow up on Roflcopter\". I refer back to this question.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4059234#p4059234\" class=\"postlink\">post 63</a>, TeChNoWC wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4057469#p4057469\" class=\"postlink\">post 44</a>, roflcopter wrote:</cite><span class=\"noboldsig\">unvote, vote: milk</span><br><br>if he's scum, arugula is too.  seacore is town.<br>discuss.<br><br>@mormon, is there anyone you think has done anything scummy? you seem like you're trying to avoid concrete suspicions, opting rather to go rng or, when forced to choose, picking lurkers (lack of content) instead of analyzing anyone's actual content.</div></blockquote><br><br>On what do you basis do you make this assumption? And how could you possibly of three pages of posts? Do you assume that anyone that defends anyone is buddying and therefore scum buddies?</div></blockquote><br><br>Since this argument where Techno presses on Rofl for his read on Milk/Arugula scum and Town Seacore I noted that Techno didn't follow up on his scum hunting lead. Note that as I iso Roflcopter didn't respond to Techno's question and he hand waves it away in his response to all people Absta.

Techno clearly demonstrates that if he was pressing on people for reactions with Rofl, he's doing it by ignoring my concern (i.e. not following up on Rofl). He's not following up on cases. He's attacking and seeing where it sticks. In the time I brought up the concern (i.e. Roflcopter is making strange claims, Techno is leading this charge) I noted that Techno still forgets this. lulz.

You know the kind where scum is trying to out neighbours/masons. The former being unconfirmed, but if both players have strong town reads on the other you could still take a notch down scum by behaving like a mason duo. However proper play by neighbours is to scum hunt both within the game/at night. Anyways, I digress since this is more theory speech.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Techno wrote:</cite>I haven't ruled out the possibility that DT is town, sure. I need to look at some of his other meta, but claiming someone as scum and neighbour, and then SOMEONE else as scum by association, after 6 posts each is oddly untown, and sounds like keen scum to me. Plus the fact that it was right after I had put his name up as a scumread ('shit ive been detected, going into im really protown lets kill scum attack mode!'). Seems pretty scummy to me.</div></blockquote><br><br>Lol I called you and roflcopter scum buddies. I.e. Roflcopter/Techno team with a missing 3rd person out there.

Because you knew you were safe from that.  <br>- IceGuy keeps ignoring me in 414 and in 422 where he acts completely sure that SensFan's lynch is a mislynch and pretends it was a quick-hammer.<br><br>IceGuy has also tried to taint both DTMaster and TeChNoWC with accusations of bussing without developing. <br><br>SensFan, with his scummyness and anti-town attitude was going to get lynched so scum tries to get town points by pretending to be the concerned townie who's against the mislynch.

We gained nothing from a dragged D1 full of UberNinja spam and nonsense chatter. <br><br>From all your day 2 posts, I see no evidence of alleged gathered info from d1 to justify your lack of interest in actively trying (with reasons) to lynch someone and avoid SensFan's lynch.<br><br>He Keeps mischaracterizing the SensFan lynch as just a quick mislynch and quickhammer when the player was clearly refusing to claim and had been warned several times.  <br><br>And now tries to smear the whole wagon on him with an assorted list of unsupported smears.<br><br>I hope everyone will vote him until he can no longer ignore the challenges against his very scummy behavior.<br><br>Lastly, after he is lynched and flips scum (I'm quite sure of this).  Don't forget that scum busses.  Don't just think that scum defends each other and attacks town.  Sometimes scum will, even from very early in the game, bus a partner and defend a town player.

All five of us? Post hoc fallacy, Iceguy. Please show that your suspicion on X is the main reason that X suspects you and I'll listen.</div></blockquote><br><br>I'm not saying they are all scum, I know it is very likely I'm wrong on at least one of my five suspects (13 players and 5 anti-town players would be very uncommon).<br><br>I just think it's interesting that the wagon on me is fueled almost completely by suspicious players who have not contributed anything but quickhammer (roflcopter), committed a version of the QT tell (<span style=\"color: #FF0000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Arugula</span></span>), sit back while town attacked town and suddenly came in with a scummy post when a lynch opportunity happened (Techno), had a very insincere exchange with the aforementioned (DTM), or participated in a similarly scummy way and posted about the RB in a rolefishing manner (absta101).<br><br>Maybe rofl is just a town VI.<br>Maybe <span style=\"color: #FF0000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Arugula</span></span> sincerely doesn't know you don't get notified when you're RBd.<br>Maybe Techno really had no idea what to do and jumped on the SensFan wagon because he thought SensFan was scum.<br>Maybe DT's idea of scumhunting is attacking somebody with copied arguments when it's already clear somebody else was going to get lynched.<br>Maybe absta really only thought about RBs because of his last game.<br><br>But I refuse to believe this holds for every single one of them.</div></blockquote><br>Interesting. Something stands out to me about how IceGuy says Arugula is 100 times scummier, but doesn't vote for him.<br><br>I think a good scum tell is when scum busses their newbier buddies by calling them stupid and saying they're scummy, but not actually putting any pressure on them.<br><br>Speaking <span class=\"noboldsig\">about</span> them in the third person (instead of speaking <span class=\"noboldsig\">TO</span> them) is also a pretty good scumbuddy tell in my book. I'll still have to read more on this, but for now my vote's leaning very heavily towards Arugula.<br><br>The amount of suspicion he tried to throw on my V/LA lolhammer was also disproportionate to the amount of attention and disrepute that it had already earned. More simply, it was scummy as hell, but when he reacted to it, he did two things:<br><br>1. he made sure to mention that it was scummy, but didn't say anything about lynching me the next day<br>2. he made sure to mention that i suggested we lynch roflcopter who is confirmed town. which is an appeal to authority<br><br>oh and that's another thing... i haven't really been paying much attention to this game up until this point... how is roflcopter confirmed town again? is it because a hider hid behind him or something? i vaguely remember that but if somebody could put my mind at ease that'd be nice.<br><br>Between Elmo and Arugula, it's DEFINITELY Arugula. If roflcopter isn't actually confirmed town, that makes things significantly more complicated.<br><br>I have to run so I will come back to this in a bit (probably an hour or two)."}

believe that there was a 100% town wagon on scum. No bussers? WTF.<br><br>On the other hand, looking at the absta counterwagon, Elmo (and myself) don't look so great either, since that was before Junpei had noticed the Seacore crumb, and there was not much reason to bus your buddy at that point; absta101 could just as easily have been lynched as IceGuy imo.<br><br>Going back up to 506/556, Elmo gets a slight bit of town cred for changing wagons to me... but then he switches back to the absta101 wagon with me before the day is over, instead of bussing IceGuy (if he's scum it'd be bussing, if he's town it wouldn't be. obviously). And Arugula does get town points for being on the IceGuy wagon at a point where IceGuy wasn't the only lynch possibility (if he'd have been on the DTMaster wagon, that'd be useless, because DTMaster's lynch was a foregone conclusion after Junpei noticing Seacore's crumbs). So that brings them back to decently even, at least in terms of pure VC analysis.<br><br>All of this is making my head hurt. I can't tell which of them it is, but I'm still leaning Arugula based on posts. I'll probably have to ISO scum again, and then also ISO both Elmo and Arugula again.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4106415#p4106415\" class=\"postlink\">post 591</a>, snifit wrote:</cite><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Votecount 3.1</span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: green\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">roflcopter</span></span> (0) -</span> <br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: gray\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Arugula</span></span> (0) -</span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: green\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Thomith</span></span> (0) -</span> <br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: green\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Junpei</span></span> (0) -</span> <br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: green\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">UberNinja</span></span> (0) -</span> <br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: red\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">DTMaster</span></span> (0) -</span> <br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: green\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Humble Poirot</span></span> (0) -</span> <br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: gray\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Elmo Teh AzN</span></span> (0) -</span> <br><br>Not Voting: <span style=\"color: green\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">roflcopter</span></span>, <span style=\"color: gray\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Arugula</span></span>, <span style=\"color: green\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Thomith</span></span>, <span style=\"color: green\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Junpei</span></span>, <span style=\"color: green\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">UberNinja</span></span>, <span style=\"color: red\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">DTMaster</span></span>, <span style=\"color: green\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Humble Poirot</span></span>, <span style=\"color: gray\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Elmo Teh AzN</span></span></div></blockquote><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4107585#p4107585\" class=\"postlink\">post 634</a>, snifit wrote:</cite><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Votecount 3.2</span><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: green\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">roflcopter</span></span> (0) -</span> <br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: gray\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Arugula</span></span> (0) -</span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: green\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Thomith</span></span> (0) -</span> <br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: green\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Junpei</span></span> (0) -</span> <br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: green\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">UberNinja</span></span> (L-4) -</span> <span style=\"color: gray\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Elmo Teh AzN</span></span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: red\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">DTMaster</span></span> (L-2) -</span> <span style=\"color: green\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Junpei</span></span>, <span style=\"color: gray\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Arugula</span></span>, <span style=\"color: green\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Thomith</span></span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: green\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Humble Poirot</span></span> (0) -</span> <br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: gray\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Elmo Teh AzN</span></span> (0) -</span> <br><br>Not Voting: <span style=\"color: green\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">roflcopter</span></span>, <span style=\"color: green\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">UberNinja</span></span>, <span style=\"color: red\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">DTMaster</span></span>, <span style=\"color: green\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Humble Poirot</span></span></div></blockquote><br>Hello, what have we here?

I can't tell much from here. Gonna go read each one's reasons for their votes on Thomith.<br><br>As for me, my vote looks scummy as fuck obviously, but it's the losing play as scum because of how much suspicion it throws on me. To be honest I only threw it because a) I was on V/LA and didn't give a fuck (and didn't realize the game was so close to over because I wasn't paying attention), and b) I wanted to be left alive longer, which looking scummy allows me to do, because it helps me avoid the night kill.<br><br>Either way, I'm glad Humble Poirot was killed, because I can't read him for shit. I'll have to check who besides me he suspected, because he seemed to be one of the main proponents for my lynch today and that doesn't make sense to NK him if you're looking for someone who's a good idea to kill. If anything, you should kill off roflcopter because he's FUCKING CONFIRMED TOWN.<br><br>Which is another thing I'm 100% WTF about. If that's some sort of role shenanigans where the scum have a 1-shot Publish ability or w/e where they're allowed to give the mod something to write in a post, and they chose to make him write that roflcopter was an Innocent Child, then I'm going to be fucking pissed that I actually put effort into this game.

First and foremost, Roflcopter is a confirmed town Innocent Child. That leaves me, Elmo, and Arugula. I know I'm town, so in my eyes, that leaves Elmo and Arugula.<br>2. Arugula was on the SensFan wagon, the IceGuy wagon, the DTMaster wagon, and the Thomith wagon. In other words, ALL of the wagons that made lynches.<br>3. Elmo Teh AzN was off the SensFan wagon, off the IceGuy wagon, off the DTMaster wagon, and on the Thomith wagon. Only one of the wagons that made lynches.<br>4. Scum made a point to kill derptown absta101 on Night 2. Why? I have no idea. Maybe it was just a really derpy kill.<br>5. Scum killed off Humble Poirot last night instead of killing CONFIRMED TOWN ROFLCOPTER. Even more than the N2 absta101 kill, that's either deliberately engineered to rub town's faces in shit, OR it's another derpkill.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Here are <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">my thoughts</span>:</span><br><br>1. We saw what looked like a derpkill N2, and what looked like another one on N4. The Junpei N3 one was pretty expected, so that doesn't count. The only other possibility is that scum knew town was hopelessly lost after being all town on SensFan's wagon (this sentence supposes Elmo-scum over Arugula-scum) and decided they could just play with us, like a cat with a mouse, batting it back and forth like a tennis ball, before it eats it. The mouse, not the tennis ball. So I'm confused whether it truly was derpkills, or whether it was just really fucking cheeky scum.<br><br>2. Elmo was off both scum lynches, and Arugula was on both. My logic tells me that this means Elmo is scum, but my heart and my gut tells me that this means Arugula is scum. I want to know what roflcopter thinks of this, and I also want Elmo to explain why he was on neither scum wagon, ESPECIALLY after the seemingly incontrovertible evidence provided by Junpei as to why DTMaster was scum, based on Seacore's breadcrumbs.<br><br>3. I am considering whether it would be better to no-lynch at this point, or if that would be useless. If it appears I'm going to be the lynch for today, and believe me, I don't blame you guys for wanting it, based on my play thus far (though I would say it's too stupid/scummy to be scum, honestly), then I think a no-lynch is better. Here's why: With the night kill (assuming it's compulsive/compulsory/whatever), that'd leaves 3 alive instead of 4, and that's just a better chance to hit scum by anyone's measure.<br><br>Pros: There's a smaller number of townies, and if Roflcopter is not killed, the game becomes broken for town.<br>Cons: Roflcopter is probably just gonna die, leaving me/us right back here, choosing between Elmo and Arugula.<br><br>Weighing that around in my head, I realize that it's probably pretty fuckin' useless to no-lynch. Whereas if roflcopter was not confirmed town I would 100% be insistent upon no-lynching at this point.<br><br>4. So that means the best course of action is for me to convince roflcopter somehow that I'm not the remaining scum, and just lynch to kill the final scum. Which I'm fine with. At the start of this day, I had no idea who to suspect. Roflcopter was among my list of suspects, along with even a few dead people (yes, I really hadn't been paying attention). After that, I began to suspect Arugula a lot, mostly because of the posts made at the end of Day 4, and because it seemed like Elmo wasn't town because of posts I'd read from the scum. I thought roflcopter was stupid for saying he wouldn't lynch Arugula.<br><br>Now though, after having read the game, done the VCA, and thought my position through, I'm undecided. Since roflcopter has been paying much more attention to the game than I have throughout it's duration, normally in this situation I would simply defer to his judgement at this point, EXCEPT:<br><br>5. The only reason to leave town-roflcopter alive in a 4p MYLO situation is if you're 100% sure he'll vote the way you want, or at least not vote for you. So I'll need to go read roflcopter and Humble Poirot, and come back again in a few minutes."}

The balance is largely due to my reviewers Vi, Empking, and Llamafluff. My original design was more town-sided.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Set-up</span><br>The core of the set-up was the Hider and Traitor roles. I think the Hider role is pretty interesting, and I like the dynamic the Traitor makes for the scum team. They're both double-edged roles. The Hider is obviously a powerful PR, but it suicides when it gets a guilty. There's also the possibility of the mafia (or vig) hitting the same target as the Hider. The Traitor subverts the notion of informed-minority v. uninformed-majority. The natural assumption that a two-member mafia team makes in a mini game is that there's another team or an SK floating around--an assumption I expected to be reinforced by the JoAT's vig shot. That weakness of the Traitor role can also be a strength, though; it muddies associations which, in theory, muddies scumhunting somewhat. Witness how scum had a PR-read on Arugula in the early game.<br><br>The Innocent Child was an anti-swing measure. An unskilled or unlucky Hider would be devastating to the town in this set-up. At best, I expected the IC to just stop a mislynch if the town seemed to be heading in the wrong direction; there was a good chance the town would end up on even numbers, so it wasn't likely to make lynches more accurate. roflcopter's use of the role was something I didn't anticipate though, and I think it was a great play.<br><br>The JoAT was there because, well, I felt town needed to be a little more well-rounded in its PRs. Another investigative role was out of the question; a protective role would be too powerful with the possible numbers of innocents; a killing role would make the game too swingy, but town was underpowered with just the IC and Hider. After a few iterations, we settled on vig-track-block for the JoAT. I was surprised to see Junpei hold his shot N1; I don't think it's common for people to give up a chance at killing. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\"> His restraint proved to be dangerous for scum, though, as he still had his track and block available when there was only one scum left. I admit to being nervous about the JoAT on D3; I didn't really think about how powerful the track and block were with 1 scum left during design. If Junpei had been comfortable not claiming on D3, the game might have been broken. (Essentially a chance at a guilty result N3 and N4 and even if he doesn't target scum he generates an innocent result.)<br><br>The Mafia roleblocker was a bit of a red herring. It's only of use against the JoAT. I felt that scum didn't really need a PR, but giving them a not-very-useful roleblocker played into the informed-minorty subversion a little bit.<br><br>___<br><br>I was unhappy with the number of replacements D1. To be completely honest, if I hadn't been scrambling to keep up with the growing number of inactives, I might have thought twice about allowing UberNinja in to the game. By that time, though, I was on to the fifth replacement (the game being only ten days old) and I was just glad to have the slot filled quickly. Apologies again if you feel his play ruined your enjoyment.<br>I don't think Town really got screwed over with the replacements, though. IceGuy, a scum replacement, was caught quite quickly. Junpei, a replacement, is a formidable player. absta101 held his own.<br>I have played with both Elmo and UberNinja before. I know that, as town, they can hinder the town's efforts to find scum. Should I have refused their offers to replace in based on that? Should I be ok with it if they're replacing a scum slot? I think doing either compromises the integrity of the game. They're not trolls; they do genuinely want to play mafia. That's what we're all here for.<br>A lot of players took issue with UberNinja's posting when he entered the game. Humble Poirot PM'd me during Day 1 and complained that I allowed a player like that in to the game. Honestly? Even if I had refused him, it wouldn't have been because he's a spammy poster. That was something entirely new to me about his playstyle. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\"> <br>There were also complaints about his V/LA in the late game. Yeah, a weeklong V/LA sucks, but town rushed the day anyway (yes, I know UberNinja's hammer could not have been predicted). There were also complaints about it being a 'fake' V/LA. I was confused by those. I'm a game moderator, not the internet police; no one PMed me to tell me he was posting elsewhere during his V/LA. When in doubt, PM the mod.<br>(Also my wife gave birth toward the end of his V/LA. Sorry if my inattentiveness for that day or two contributed to the frustration.)<br><br>___<br><br>I'd like to hear some feedback from the players about their roles.<br>roflcopter, did you enjoy playing the Innocent Child? I've noticed being conftown can be a bit of a motivation-killer.<br>Arugula and regular scum: what's your opinion on the Traitor role? Interesting mechanic? Annoyingly non-standard? Arugula, I noticed you paired your vote to one of the scum through Day 1 (and maybe Day 2, my memory is fading). Were you trying to signal them? What was your strategy for the early game?<br><br>I can give individual play feedback if anyone's interested. Off to work for now, though."}

I think it worked well in this setup.<br><br>My strategy early on was lay low, buddy a little bit with DT and Mormon, and don't come of as a PR. I didn't do that though, and I was surprised they thought I was one. Luckily they didn't kill me.<br><br>If Seacore didn't die as early as he did, I would have been done. I also wanted to ignore the Seacore crumb that Junpei pointed out, but it was too good.<br><br>When DT was lynched, I thought I was done for. Thomith was quicklynched and I had to decide between killing rofl and Humble. (I would have killed rofl the night after he was confirmed, but I kept thinking there was a doctor) I decided to kill Humble because it would make Uber look worse and he would be easy lynchbait.<br><br>I really should have hammered Uber, but I thought it was entertaining how he kept saying be the hero and talking about how bad Elmo was as scum.<br><br>I really enjoyed this game."}

Plus the whole eagle picture thing. And while some people are a bit annoyed at UN, I really liked the whole UN/rofl exchange, simply from a humour POV. This was great:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4142534#p4142534\" class=\"postlink\">post 768</a>, roflcopter wrote:</cite>i will be taking my sweet time deciding for myself so shaddup</div></blockquote><br><br>And the whole 'I hate you all for being so scummy' comment, lol. Watching rofl's frustration was funny as. Must have been even funnier from Arugula's POV. Though despite being wrong in the end and having to 'be that guy; be the hero', I still think rofl played well in the finish. Arugula was simply running rings around everyone and the last few moments of this game were funny as fuck."}
