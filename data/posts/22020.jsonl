You may not directly quote (or pretend to directly quote) the moderator. Paraphrasing (for role claims, etc.) is acceptable. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#8000FF\">Bold, purple text</div></div> is reserved for the moderator. Small/invisible text is not allowed. Cryptography is not allowed.<br>\n2. There is to be NO personal communication outside of this thread unless your role PM specifically allows it.<br>\n3. If you have a role with a Night action your choices are due to me by the posted deadline. If I do not receive your choice via PM by the posted deadline you will forfeit your actions.<br>\n4. Roles with Night actions will not be able to submit an action on Night 0 (i.e. during the confirmation stage).<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Voting, Deadlines, and Death</div><br>\n6. Votes must be submitted formatted as <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: snifit</div> or <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: snifit</span> to be counted. Obvious abbreviations and unambiguous spelling errors will be accepted as valid votes.<br>\n7. Day phases will last for 3 weeks. If a lynch has not been achieved before the deadline occurs, no one will be lynched.<br>\n8. For a lynch to occur, Half+1 (rounded down) of the remaining players must vote for the same player.<br>\n9. Instead of a lynch, players may opt to end the Day early via a Vote: No Lynch. Half (rounded down) of the remaining players must vote to No Lynch to end the Day early.<br>\n10. A player is considered to be lynched as soon as the required number of votes are achieved. Once a player is lynched, the game is in Twilight until I post a death scene; all players including the one who was lynched may continue to post during Twilight.<br>\n11. Night phases will last for 72 hours.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Activity, Etiquette, and Miscellaneous</div><br>\n12. Players who fail to post in a 72-hour period will be prodded via PM. Prodded players have 48 hours from the time of the PM to post in the thread. Players who fail to respond to their prod will be replaced.<br>\n13. Upon receiving a third prod, a player will be replaced.<br>\n14. Players may declare V/LA if they expect to be unable to post for a period of time. Either PM the moderator or post in bold.<br>\n15. Show respect for your fellow players.<br>\n16. If you have a request or question for the moderator, either PM it or post it in bold.<br>\n17. Violation of these rules will be dealt with according to their severity, up to and including a Modkill.<br>\n<br>\n<fieldset style=\"border:3px outset grey;padding:5px 10px\"><legend style=\"text-transform:uppercase;margin:0 0.6em;padding:0em 0.33em\">Sample Role</legend>Greetings!

It's not the same as \"disrupting an attack\"/scum hunting in a way that you two can't do it on Absta. The reasoning is legitimated in Aragula's response since part of the game is to defend your town reads and steer town towards your scum reads.

Sorry for the lateness since work and soreness from the gym and all.<br>\n<br>\n@Milk/Thomith Page 2-3 Stuffs.<br>\nIt took a few rereads but looking at Milk's POV: The vote and the RQS statement are independent things. It took me a few re-reads but there seems to be some blending of both RQS arguments with the votes assuming you take Milk's side. I can agree on a theory standpoint how <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4055237#p4055237\" class=\"postlink\">how RQS is not scummy but makes Milk view their play differently.</a> These cues are best used for meta - alignment link analysis.<br>\n<br>\nI'm ok for the stance that RQS is fluffy (hence my original post this game) which leads to fruitless advances. I'm ok with Milk's reasoning with player trend analysis. But otherwise I find these pages more about mafia theory and less about actual interactions. It doesn't seem to be a strong argument for this early case. <br>\n<br>\nHowever I dislike Thomith's followup to his Milk vote. Particularly the \"cautious\" reasoning of Mormon. I was fine with him following a person's case if he felt that it's a good one. I'm not fine when Thomith's Mormon analysis because to me when I read between the lines it doesn't seem like a person should be convinced by a cautious person's vote. If a person has a good case I would be more suspect of the lack of voting (i.e Mormon) because this could be an early bus attack link (i.e Mormon-bork) or something fishy like that. Seeing how Thomith admitted that there should be doubt in Mormon's character I see this more of someone latching on to a case in a lazy manner, which is scummy in my eyes.<br>\n<br>\n@Mormon<br>\n<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4058708#p4058708\" class=\"postlink\">This post is scummy to me</a>. Mainly because caution at this stage of the game shouldn't be an issue with exception to L-1 quick votes. Which it in self is informative. For a game of this caliber I expect town to be more competent to avoid quick hammers. Thus if a quick hammer occured on an early day 1 wagon, we actually narrow down the pool for scum targets (or should be able to) since only scum would push a wagon so fast.<br>\n<br>\nLike wise if we do run up a powerrole, the need to claim isn't present for this stage of the game. That person won't be lynched because I expect town to recognize the context of the wagon (i.e. early day 1). <br>\n<br>\nFinally if we do have town that sheep wagons like so, we have more serious problems then outing PRs since our day play would be severely compromised due to player style in game rather then any other repercussions of losing PRs. In other words scum would play to be the leaders of this kind of crowd since that's far stronger then lynching PRs. <br>\n<br>\nSo this comment pings on my scumdar for the above reasons.

You're trying to shift the conversation out of your own scummyness (your smear posts) and put everything into DTMaster's guess of a scumteam (And discrediting him for it).<br>\n<br>\nAnd the fun fact, is that you keep throwing these subtle smears at anyone who attacks you.  Right now, it's me.  You're telling me I'm directing DTMaster on how to slip under the radar.  That's an implication that I'm scum with DTMaster. Yet, you don't outright say it.

Can you stop saying neighbour for everything?  Try and define clearly what you're saying.  If you're accusing DTMaster and me of being in a scumteam, say so.  If you're implying someone has the role neighbour, say it.  If you're implying people are acting too friendly to each other, phrase it in an unambiguous way.  <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">\"Buddying up to someone\"</div> is a good expression for that.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>There is some serious neighbouring going on between DT and Poirot, smells pretty fishy!!  </div></blockquote><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline-flex;text-decoration:line-through\">Again, this is the type of mild accusations that scum usually makes.

He goes to the trouble of reading up on Thom's early games to get a more substantial read on him. Just too make sure of his claims in post #9, I might have to read the earlier games as well.

You're trying to shift the conversation out of your own scummyness (your smear posts) and put everything into DTMaster's guess of a scumteam (And discrediting him for it).<br>\n<br>\nAnd the fun fact, is that you keep throwing these subtle smears at anyone who attacks you.  Right now, it's me.  You're telling me I'm directing DTMaster on how to slip under the radar.  That's an implication that I'm scum with DTMaster. Yet, you don't outright say it.  You just smear.  <br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div> '2. This kind of accusation towards a player that has few but developed posts without any evidence makes it even worse.' Sorry, were you talking about DT?</div></blockquote>Yes.  <blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>\"how does DTMaster's reasoning worry you? As in DTMaster is town and failing?\" what, the fuck. Know something I don't? His reasoning worries me just as it worries you, because he <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">called me out as scummy and a neighbour</div> after like four posts...</div></blockquote>  (emphasis mine) Well, I get the impression that you think DTMaster is scum.  If you think he is scum, why be worried about his reasoning? You'd just dismiss it if faulty.  The \"worry\" seemed to be an implication that you were unsure of his alignment.  At least, that's my interpretation. (preview edit: Considering you're claiming to be unsure of his alignment this might be excusable)<br>\n<br>\nWhen did he call you neighbour?  Can you stop saying neighbour for everything?  Try and define clearly what you're saying.  If you're accusing DTMaster and me of being in a scumteam, say so.  If you're implying someone has the role neighbour, say it.  If you're implying people are acting too friendly to each other, phrase it in an unambiguous way.  <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">\"Buddying up to someone\"</div> is a good expression for that.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>There is some serious neighbouring going on between DT and Poirot, smells pretty fishy!!  </div></blockquote><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline-flex;text-decoration:line-through\">Again, this is the type of mild accusations that scum usually makes.  Trying to paint your attackers as the scumteam without arguments and without outright saying so.</div><br>\n<br>\npreview edit:<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div> Hope your not taking my last neighbour comment seriously either.  </div></blockquote>  <br>\nWhy wouldn't we? You've already hinted at a connection between me and DTMaster.<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div> Read it in context with the rest of my posts dude. A dig at the whole neighbour stuff.  </div></blockquote> YOU are the only one throwing the words neighbourhood and neighbouring around.<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I haven't ruled out the possibility that DT is town, sure. I need to look at some of his other meta, but claiming someone as scum and neighbour</div></blockquote>WHERE did DTMaster call you a Neighbour?<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">I've iso'd DTMaster and looked for words starting with nei.  No result</div></div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\n1. I'm not ASSUMING that you are on a scumteam with DT, merely observing. I accused you of bias, which isn't me guessing your alignment, its saying STOP BEING BIASED.<br>\n2. I was referring to the fact that DT seemed to be doing that to me, not the other way around. Again, bias.<br>\n3. It's more than excusable, because I didn't assume DT's alignment and you know it.<br>\n4. Fine, said we were both mafia. Neighbour is an easy way of summing up DT's case that me and rofl are scumbuddies together. In terms of my neighbour comment about you and DT, not sure why everyone didn't pick up on the sarcasm, but if everyone is assuming I wasn't, I fail to see why I haven't been lynched yet. This game worries me already and I can't see town winning, and that's from D1. You seemed to be buddying with DT, yes, but that doesn't mean I was suggesting you were scum; I was appealing to you to consider both arguments rather than pigeon hole me. To be honest I have the inclination that a D1 flip from me might make this game move back on track, but at this point I can see you and DT turning around and saying \"well, it was clear Techno was acting scummy, so we did what we had to do. He only has himself to blame for being lynched\"<br>\n<br>\nStop and consider what you are doing before more misinformed voters and scummers pop out of the woodwork and jump me, and also destroy any case that my townflip could shed any light on who is actually scum and advance town rather than being a horrible waste of mislynching time.", "time": "Thu May 24, 2012 6:55 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=22020&start=150", "forum": "53", "thread": "22020"}

{"number": 184, "id": "4072051", "user": "TeChNoWC", "user_id": "18888", "content": "@ Poirot: I already stated my read on you to Seacore, which was that I couldn't tell either way. You seem town in your intent and scumhunting, yet at the same time your buddying + bias towards me had me thinking you might be scum, but nothing telling yet. You seem somewhat town to me, particularly after your last post. I understand why you might think I was 'smearing' plus my initial post on DT and rofl was pretty lazy, but I felt your riding of me was not relational to what I had said and you were reading far into my supposed 'motivations'. At the same time I felt you weren't doing the same for DT, and in fact quite the opposite; you were defending his scummy actions and even giving pointers as to how to react to me. That didn't necessarily make me think you were scum, just that you skewed in your thinking. My initial read on DT and subsequent post was merely a vibe read, since he rambled a lot and seemed nervous; I've never played with DT and I felt entitled to say this without any need to back it up, because it wasn't as if I was on a scumhunt rampage to nail his arse. It was just a vibe, and I don't play by vibes, but I certainly look into them.<br>\n<br>\nDT's response to me seemed to suggest my initial vibe on him was wrong, but his claim that 'I was likely scum, and therefore rofl was too simply by association' just seemed like scum on the attack. I'm not sure why you didn't feel this was, yet me pointing out how scummy it was makes me scum?<br>\n<br>\n@ Arugula: Not on purpose, I remember you not liking your name being spelt wrong but I actually thought I had the right spelling, and 'u' was the wrong one. I didn't ask you to reply, I said I was going to reply to you. Fair enough that maybe my sarcasm wasn't obvious, but your initial response read to me as 'just looked at the last post, didn't read the rest of the argument'. And now again more bias, when I am getting jumped on for suspecting a link (which, I might add, has now been affirmed and my suspicions were correct) between Humble/DT. Yet I never was adamant they were scum together, or that there link was any more than an ingame one, or even adamant at all, I simply suggested it. But DT on the other hand MAKES CLAIM I AND ROFL ARE SCUM BUDDIES FROM ONE POST, and he gets nothing. Not even a slap on the wrist. Just 'oh no mister good towny, you shouldn't say that'. My point exactly about the dangers of alliances.<br>\n<br>\n@Thomith: By sheer maths, no more than one, but a good chance there is one. Yet one amongst four is enough to be a serious issue; and there is still every possibility, even if unlikely, that there is more. But again the problem then comes when, say for instance, DT flips scum and then we consider 'well, according to the maths the rest of them are town'. No, the point is, EVERYONE should be suspect because we have no idea. Heck, all four of them could be scum, or none, but we should assume nothing, and therefore, make no alliances. Unbiased, everyone suspect, anyone potential for scum and therefore a lynch. NEVER assume.", "time": "Fri May 25, 2012 7:53 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=22020&start=175", "forum": "53", "thread": "22020"}

Yeah, gimme a sec to isolate exactly what you said that bugged me and I will post it in my next post, I'm still having issues scrolling through text and isolating parts of it through all the command jargon <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\"> Basically though I felt you were picking on me for all the things DT was doing too. I found some of your points on me valid, but blown out of proportion. However, they applied to DT more, I thought. Smear campaign against me (and he was planning more with his '1v1' and 'walls of quotes' threat at me) which was something you accused me of doing, bad scumhunting (my initial post was lazy and based off vibes, because I hadn't read enough of the post but I still wanted to reply when asked, and so I gave my reads based off my vibes at the time) which was a fair point to make about my initial post, I agree; but DT's later assertions of me and rofl were much much worse, and you, assuming he was town, just told him he shouldn't do it rather than 'hang on a minute; is this guy for real?'. No one STILL has pointed out his case on me about rofl and I have asked a million times, and I am the only one pulling him up for it.<br>\n2. I regretted saying that after I posted. Bias I won't take back, because I still feel you were, but since then you've looked at it more critically and me saying you were short-sighted was probably uncalled for. I just had no other way of conveying my frustration. Even before I made that post you seemed to be analysing the situation in a very unbiased manner and I didn't take that into account when I wrote that comment, I just gave in to my frustrations, so I apologise.<br>\n<br>\nI understand yours and Seacore's points that DT may have just been aggro town and there was nothing scummy in his approach, and this may be true. I am eager to hear back from DT on the matter. I still want to know what his case was on me and rofl not responding to each other as that was the crux of the entire debate, and at the moment I still have my reservations about his 'perceived towniness' by everyone else.

More on that last part in a bit.<br>\nMy posts, while not gigantic in quantity, have pretty much all had content.

It just makes no sense; there's no Scum motivation there. As for noticing it, I don't generally reread games on D1, so when exactly am I supposed to have noticed an old post not being there?<br>\nFinally, you are \"showing intent to hammer\"? What the hell does that mean? If you wanted to hammer you should have just done it. A bit gunshy? Afraid to be the one D2 that has to explain why you hammered the Town player?

I will go into lecture smug mode now. Allow me to refer to the Wikipedia good sir.<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>MafiaWiki wrote:</cite>OMGUS stands for \"Oh My God, You Suck (for voting for me)!\". it is sometimes used as a shorthand to indicate that you are voting for someone primarily because they voted for you.</div></blockquote><br>\nWith this as an example: <br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Mafiawiki wrote:</cite>The term was introduced by GL mafia player Purgation in GL mafia game 29 on 08-12-2001 04:13 AM. The sequence of posts went as follows:<br>\n<br>\nRyoushi: I am going to Vote: Purgation because I don't like any of the other bandwagons.<br>\n<br>\nPurgation: OMG, you suck. Vote Ryoushi.<br>\n<br>\nRyoushi: I didn't expect that kind of response, though...</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nIgnoring the vote because that's not required for the basis of your attack (that and it's more so a semantic of the argument if I go down that road which is distracting in general) this is not how I attacked you. Did I attack you for calling me out? No. I acknowledged your original attack because it's valid. See this exchange:<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Techno wrote:</cite>2. DT: he seems twitchy and nervous.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>DTM wrote:</cite>a. Twitchy? I'm impressed that you could see my physical body writhing awkwardly from some text on an internet forum. (/bad joke) That aside I'm confused to why the scum read in particular. Details please.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\n<br>\nDetails fleshed out by you are fine (with regards to posting style as an argument to my alignment). I take that hit. OMGUS attacks? I think not. Please recall the original argument:<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>DTM wrote:</cite> Aside from that I noticed a scummy activity. You failed to follow up on Roflcopter . Between your Post 63 here to Roflcopter's post of questions on page 4 here and yourresponse here later that day I noticed you failed to follow up on your very own scum case .

Techno clearly demonstrates that if he was pressing on people for reactions with Rofl, he's doing it by ignoring my concern (i.e. not following up on Rofl). He's not following up on cases. He's attacking and seeing where it sticks. In the time I brought up the concern (i.e. Roflcopter is making strange claims, Techno is leading this charge) I noted that Techno still forgets this. lulz.

Something stands out to me about how IceGuy says Arugula is 100 times scummier, but doesn't vote for him.<br>\n<br>\nI think a good scum tell is when scum busses their newbier buddies by calling them stupid and saying they're scummy, but not actually putting any pressure on them.<br>\n<br>\nSpeaking <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">about</div> them in the third person (instead of speaking <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">TO</div> them) is also a pretty good scumbuddy tell in my book. I'll still have to read more on this, but for now my vote's leaning very heavily towards Arugula.<br>\n<br>\nThe amount of suspicion he tried to throw on my V/LA lolhammer was also disproportionate to the amount of attention and disrepute that it had already earned. More simply, it was scummy as hell, but when he reacted to it, he did two things:<br>\n<br>\n1. he made sure to mention that it was scummy, but didn't say anything about lynching me the next day<br>\n2. he made sure to mention that i suggested we lynch roflcopter who is confirmed town. which is an appeal to authority<br>\n<br>\noh and that's another thing... i haven't really been paying much attention to this game up until this point... how is roflcopter confirmed town again? is it because a hider hid behind him or something? i vaguely remember that but if somebody could put my mind at ease that'd be nice.<br>\n<br>\nBetween Elmo and Arugula, it's DEFINITELY Arugula.

No bussers? WTF.<br>\n<br>\nOn the other hand, looking at the absta counterwagon, Elmo (and myself) don't look so great either, since that was before Junpei had noticed the Seacore crumb, and there was not much reason to bus your buddy at that point; absta101 could just as easily have been lynched as IceGuy imo.<br>\n<br>\nGoing back up to 506/556, Elmo gets a slight bit of town cred for changing wagons to me... but then he switches back to the absta101 wagon with me before the day is over, instead of bussing IceGuy (if he's scum it'd be bussing, if he's town it wouldn't be. obviously). And Arugula does get town points for being on the IceGuy wagon at a point where IceGuy wasn't the only lynch possibility (if he'd have been on the DTMaster wagon, that'd be useless, because DTMaster's lynch was a foregone conclusion after Junpei noticing Seacore's crumbs).

I can't tell much from here. Gonna go read each one's reasons for their votes on Thomith.<br>\n<br>\nAs for me, my vote looks scummy as fuck obviously, but it's the losing play as scum because of how much suspicion it throws on me. To be honest I only threw it because a) I was on V/LA and didn't give a fuck (and didn't realize the game was so close to over because I wasn't paying attention), and b) I wanted to be left alive longer, which looking scummy allows me to do, because it helps me avoid the night kill.<br>\n<br>\nEither way, I'm glad Humble Poirot was killed, because I can't read him for shit. I'll have to check who besides me he suspected, because he seemed to be one of the main proponents for my lynch today and that doesn't make sense to NK him if you're looking for someone who's a good idea to kill. If anything, you should kill off roflcopter because he's FUCKING CONFIRMED TOWN.<br>\n<br>\nWhich is another thing I'm 100% WTF about. If that's some sort of role shenanigans where the scum have a 1-shot Publish ability or w/e where they're allowed to give the mod something to write in a post, and they chose to make him write that roflcopter was an Innocent Child, then I'm going to be fucking pissed that I actually put effort into this game. And I'm <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">never</div> going to play another snifit game.<br>\n<br>\nAnyway, that last part is pure conjecture, so let's wrap this up...<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4132386#p4132386\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4132386#p4132386\" data-post-id=\"4132386\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 730</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=17210\">snifit</a> wrote:</cite><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Votecount 5.1</div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:green\">roflcopter</div> (0) -</div> <br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:gray\">Arugula</div> (0) -</div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:green\">UberNinja</div> (0) -</div> <br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:gray\">Elmo Teh AzN</div> (0) -</div> <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">No Lynch (0) -</div><br>\n<br>\nNot Voting: <div style=\"display:inline;color:green\">roflcopter</div>, <div style=\"display:inline;color:gray\">Arugula</div>, <div style=\"display:inline;color:green\">UberNinja</div>, <div style=\"display:inline;color:gray\">Elmo Teh AzN</div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:green\">UberNinja</div> has declared V/LA until the 20th.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Alright, here's what we <div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">know</div>.</div><br>\n<br>\n1. First and foremost, Roflcopter is a confirmed town Innocent Child. That leaves me, Elmo, and Arugula. I know I'm town, so in my eyes, that leaves Elmo and Arugula.<br>\n2. Arugula was on the SensFan wagon, the IceGuy wagon, the DTMaster wagon, and the Thomith wagon. In other words, ALL of the wagons that made lynches.<br>\n3. Elmo Teh AzN was off the SensFan wagon, off the IceGuy wagon, off the DTMaster wagon, and on the Thomith wagon. Only one of the wagons that made lynches.<br>\n4. Scum made a point to kill derptown absta101 on Night 2. Why? I have no idea. Maybe it was just a really derpy kill.<br>\n5. Scum killed off Humble Poirot last night instead of killing CONFIRMED TOWN ROFLCOPTER. Even more than the N2 absta101 kill, that's either deliberately engineered to rub town's faces in shit, OR it's another derpkill.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Here are <div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">my thoughts</div>:</div><br>\n<br>\n1. We saw what looked like a derpkill N2, and what looked like another one on N4. The Junpei N3 one was pretty expected, so that doesn't count. The only other possibility is that scum knew town was hopelessly lost after being all town on SensFan's wagon (this sentence supposes Elmo-scum over Arugula-scum) and decided they could just play with us, like a cat with a mouse, batting it back and forth like a tennis ball, before it eats it. The mouse, not the tennis ball. So I'm confused whether it truly was derpkills, or whether it was just really fucking cheeky scum.<br>\n<br>\n2. Elmo was off both scum lynches, and Arugula was on both. My logic tells me that this means Elmo is scum, but my heart and my gut tells me that this means Arugula is scum. I want to know what roflcopter thinks of this, and I also want Elmo to explain why he was on neither scum wagon, ESPECIALLY after the seemingly incontrovertible evidence provided by Junpei as to why DTMaster was scum, based on Seacore's breadcrumbs.<br>\n<br>\n3. I am considering whether it would be better to no-lynch at this point, or if that would be useless. If it appears I'm going to be the lynch for today, and believe me, I don't blame you guys for wanting it, based on my play thus far (though I would say it's too stupid/scummy to be scum, honestly), then I think a no-lynch is better. Here's why: With the night kill (assuming it's compulsive/compulsory/whatever), that'd leaves 3 alive instead of 4, and that's just a better chance to hit scum by anyone's measure.<br>\n<br>\nPros: There's a smaller number of townies, and if Roflcopter is not killed, the game becomes broken for town.<br>\nCons: Roflcopter is probably just gonna die, leaving me/us right back here, choosing between Elmo and Arugula.<br>\n<br>\nWeighing that around in my head, I realize that it's probably pretty fuckin' useless to no-lynch. Whereas if roflcopter was not confirmed town I would 100% be insistent upon no-lynching at this point.<br>\n<br>\n4. So that means the best course of action is for me to convince roflcopter somehow that I'm not the remaining scum, and just lynch to kill the final scum. Which I'm fine with. At the start of this day, I had no idea who to suspect. Roflcopter was among my list of suspects, along with even a few dead people (yes, I really hadn't been paying attention). After that, I began to suspect Arugula a lot, mostly because of the posts made at the end of Day 4, and because it seemed like Elmo wasn't town because of posts I'd read from the scum. I thought roflcopter was stupid for saying he wouldn't lynch Arugula.<br>\n<br>\nNow though, after having read the game, done the VCA, and thought my position through, I'm undecided. Since roflcopter has been paying much more attention to the game than I have throughout it's duration, normally in this situation I would simply defer to his judgement at this point, EXCEPT:<br>\n<br>\n5. The only reason to leave town-roflcopter alive in a 4p MYLO situation is if you're 100% sure he'll vote the way you want, or at least not vote for you. So I'll need to go read roflcopter and Humble Poirot, and come back again in a few minutes.", "time": "Fri Jun 22, 2012 10:51 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=22020&start=750", "forum": "53", "thread": "22020"}
