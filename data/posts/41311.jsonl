style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\"><div style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">General Rules</div></div></div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">1) Starting and Ending States:</div> All roles that can communicate at night may do during pregame. The game will end when one faction has fulfilled its win condition, unless otherwise specified.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">2) Day Procedures:</div> Each player may discuss the game and cast a single vote at a time against people they want to lynch. Day ends when either the deadline hits or a strict majority of the votes are on one person.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">3) Voting:</div> Votes should be in bold in order for them to count, for instance:<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"> Vote: xRECKONERx</div>. You may also use the <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE:  tags if you desire. If you wish to vote for a different player, you don't need to unvote. As long as I can tell who you're voting for, I don't care if you abbreviate someone's name when you vote them.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">3b) Voting Formatting:</div> We are beta testing an automatic vote counter this game... this means that we have to adhere to strict formatting. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Put a colon (:) after the word \"Vote\".</div> The vote counter will miss it if you don't. Also, <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">use full usernames</div> or at least something very close. The vote counter will attempt to match an attempted vote with a playername and find the closest match, but if it's too far off, it won't count it. <br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">4) No Lynch:</div> As an alternative to voting for someone, you may Vote: No Lynch, but for it to take effect, enough players must vote No Lynch that it would be impossible to form any other majority.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">5) Deadlines:</div> D1 deadline will be 3 weeks. Every day from then on will have a strict deadline of 2 weeks, unless I deem game issues have caused the need for an extension. I will try to keep a deadline warning in every vote count, but if I don't, it's your job to check the day start post to keep track of the deadline.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">6) Mass Inactivity: </div>In an act of pure villainy, I may shorten the deadline if I deem the activity level is unsatisfactory. You will be warned if I want you fellows to pick up the pace before I shorten the deadline.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">7) Deadline Lynches:</div> If no single player has enough votes for a lynch at the deadline, the result is No Lynch and the game proceeds to Night. Deadlines are there for a reason.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">8) Twilight:</div> After someone receives the majority vote, everyone may still discuss the game, but votes and unvotes will not be considered - the person voted for by the majority will be lynched regardless. Twilight will last until I waltz in and post a death scene (which can be quite short, but never really long)<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">9) Night Length and Procedures:</div> The topic will be locked at Night. If your Role PM specifies that you have a Night Action, you may follow the instructions on that PM to use it. Barring extenuating circumstances, nights will not last longer than 3 RL days.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">9b) Accelerated Nights:</div> If every player in the game PMs me and says they wish to speed up the night phase, I will end it once all PMs are in. <br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">10) Night Action Resubmission:</div> If you have to PM a choice to the mod (i.e. the name of someone you want to kill/protect/investigate), you may change your choice at any time during the Night by sending The Mod another PM with the new choice. The most recent choice will be honored when night deadline hits, or when the last PM for accelerating night is in.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">11) Night Action Priority:</div> This game will use <a href=\"http://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Natural_Action_Resolution\" class=\"postlink\">natural action resolution</a>, unless otherwise stated by the mod. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">12) Bolding Stuff:</div> Bolding something is how you get the mod to notice it. It's that simple.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">13) Mod Color:</div> If The Mods needs to edit your post, it will be done in <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF00\">bolded, green font</div></div>. Don't impersonate me, or I'll cut off your thumbs and feed them to you.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">14) Activity, Prods, and Replacements:</div> You will be prodded if three days have passed since your last post. If I check in and you had, say, 80 hours of inactivity but you've since posted, you will not be issued a prod... but I check in pretty frequently. If you are prodded three times or do not respond to a prod within 24 hours (meaning posting in thread), you will be replaced.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">14b) Vacation / Limited Access:</div> Real life comes up and mafia games take a long time. If you're going to be inactive for an extended amount of time, feel free to post a <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">V/LA</div> in thread. However, in order for the V/LA to be recognized, please be sure to set your inactivity in your UCP (User Control Panel -&gt; Vacation / Limited Access tab) as prods/activity checks are done from the Activity Overview.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">15) \"Last Words\" for replacements:</div> If you request replacement, you may PM me a message that you would like to have passed on to the person who replaces you.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">16) \"Bah!\" Posts:</div> If your player slot is killed off, it's probably because people don't want you around. Unless your role specifically states you can keep talking/voting/playing Monopoly with me, you are allowed one informationless \"bah\" post and then scram til endgame. Special mechanics can of course overlap.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">17) Outside Discussion:</div> Don't discuss this game outside of this thread with anyone unless your Role PM lets you do otherwise.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">18) Post Editing:</div> Editing or deleting posts is not allowed (and usually not possible). Doublepost with your changes instead. I will modkill for a single abuse of this rule.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">19a) Mod and PM quoting:</div> For role PMs, If you quote it, you will be modkilled. You can send me the reformulation (I'm pretty loose with reformulation) and I will tell you if posting it is allowed or if it needs further modifications. If you quote a PM from me, you will be terminated (barring questions about rules or something). I would advise avoiding discussion related to role PM wording as that's a quick way for a flurry of modkills to hit the game.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">19b) QTs and Private Communication:</div> If it is a moderator provided method of communication (i.e., neighbor QT, or masons who can daytalk and use AIM) do not quote it in the thread. Obviously, do not provide links to the QT in any way shape or form.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">20) Modkills:</div> Breaking any of the above rules (or flagrantly violating Rule 16) will result in you getting modkilled. Modkills can be retroactive. If a living player breaks any of these rules, the day may or may not end, depending on what would disadvantage that player's faction the most. In addition, getting modkilled results in an instant loss for that player, along with my general hatred. In short, follow the rules, don't be a dick.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">21) Small/Invisible text:</div> You may use smaller text if it amuses you, as long as it's not meant to bypass a rule. As in, no hidden messages or shit like that. I will fuck you up for fucking with my game.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">22) Win Mentality:</div> Play to win.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">23) Policy:</div> Have fun. Or else. And remember, it's a game - keep it classy and don't take things personally; everyone's doing what they have to to win.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">24) Setup Design:</div> You can try to outguess the mod, but it's probably pointless.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">25) Flavor:</div> This is a normal game, and as such, will have minimal flavor unless I'm feeling particularly in the mood.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: Sample VT PM</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\">Hello, and welcome to Mini 1560!<br>\n<br>\nYou are a <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">vanilla townie</div>.

That's perfectly normal.<br>\n<br>\nThen Aegor finds you're 'trying too hard' and votes you. But instead of shrugging and pointing out the obvious normality of your action, you actually acknowledged it was not your 'best comment', a comment that was supposed to be silly in the first place. In other words, instead of ignoring Aegor for trying to make a point on a seemingly contentless comment, you felt the need to recant.<br>\n<br>\nWhy would you do that, unless you were nervous and attempting to brush off the sudden attention you got (or could potentially get) because of Aegor's vote?", "time": "Fri Mar 14, 2014 11:51 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=41311&start=25", "forum": "53", "thread": "41311"}

That's perfectly normal.<br>\n<br>\nThen Aegor finds you're 'trying too hard' and votes you. But instead of shrugging and pointing out the obvious normality of your action, you actually acknowledged it was not your 'best comment', a comment that was supposed to be silly in the first place. In other words, instead of ignoring Aegor for trying to make a point on a seemingly contentless comment, you felt the need to recant.<br>\n<br>\nWhy would you do that, unless you were nervous and attempting to brush off the sudden attention you got (or could potentially get) because of Aegor's vote?</div></blockquote>\n\nwhy would you say this without voting unless you were only pretending to think this is the first suspicious behavior of of the game<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5745268#p5745268\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5745268#p5745268\" data-post-id=\"5745268\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 28</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=23591\">Freak</a> wrote:</cite>undo, how about this: I agree with him. <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">I was</div> trying too hard to come up with something to say.

He only says \" <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\"> no. So you like Doc?\" which again looks so artificial. He tries to add some emotion with that emoticon, but we just can tell there's none there -- probably because he is scum and he didn't know how to react. Who would reply to a non-fundamented accusation with \":( no\", if not clueless scum? Wouldn't it be natural for a townie to react actively -- to be indignated, or amused with the absurdity of the situation?<br>\n <br>\n<br>\n</li><li>In his third and last game relevant post, three days after the last (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5757180#p5757180\">308</a>), NicCage excuses himself saying \"Spring break is just one day away bear with me as I finish giving slow painful birth to one more paper\" and continues to \"promise future content\". This future content has never shown up; you'll notice the only thing he wrote after this was \"I like my avatar :p\" (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5764934#p5764934\">361</a>), as a response to a mod-prod.</li></ul>\n\n<br>\nStill, in his last relevant post, NicCage concluded by saying \"It's easier for me to interact with the game when I'm busy if people interact with me.\" This is probably NicCage's most blatant scumtell. It's obviously difficult for him to build cases on people since he already knows everyone's alignment, so he asks people to address him, so that he has a reason to post.<br>\n<br>\nAnd finally, there's that weird, uncanny emotion-faking again:<br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: </b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\"><blockquote><div><cite>NicCage wrote:</cite>Anyhow, it doesn't matter anymore, I'll be all over this tomorrow. <br>\nXoxoxoxo<br>\n~Nic</div></blockquote></div></div></div><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Conclusion</div></div><br>\n<div align=\"center\"><hr style=\"height:14px;width:95%\"></div>Let's recap.

Isn't that a pretty weak excuse to unvote the scummiest player of the game? Notice the use of the superlative -- Freak didn't say he thought I was scummy, he said I was <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">the scummiest</div>. Doesn't that seem off?<br>\n<br>\nBut since nobdy gave an alate excrement about Freak's scumtells (also because his play as scum as greatly improved over the last pages, something I can only congratulate him in all fairness), I see myself forced to move on to other targets.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">NicCage's play</div></div><br>\n<div align=\"center\"><hr style=\"height:14px;width:95%\"></div>I've done a quick reread and for now my best bet is <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">NicCage</div>. He has contributed less than CDB in quantity, and yet he is much more readable. Let's see:<br>\n\n<ul><li>He made a total of 6 posts, from which <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">three</div> (3) are game-relevant.<br>\n<br>\n  <br>\n</li><li>In his first game-relevant post (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5749782#p5749782\">156</a>), following a prod-dodge the day before, he jumps on Doc's early wagon (Doc was the one with most votes at the time), with very unnatural formulations: <div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: </b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\"><blockquote><div><cite>NicCage wrote:</cite>Grrrr mad Doc. Building cases out of thin air is kinda what happens at the start of the game, but I would like to know exactly what you're referring to</div></blockquote><blockquote><div><cite>NicCage wrote:</cite>Doc Holliday's reasoning feels fake and his attempt to discredit the people voting him looks scummy</div></blockquote></div></div></div><br>\nThat \"Grrrr mad Doc\" is particularly off -- he seems to be trying to convey some kind of emotion, probably to pass as a genuinely frustrated townie, but he fails miserably.<br>\nAt the end of this post, he says \"There were other things I noticed, but I don't have time to get to them right now. Hopefully later.\" He never did get to those.<br>\n  <br>\n<br>\n</li><li>His next post (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5750533#p5750533\">171</a>) his a prompt reply to Fate's short \"NicCage+CDB; one more scum to catch\". He only says \" <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\"> no. So you like Doc?\" which again looks so artificial. He tries to add some emotion with that emoticon, but we just can tell there's none there -- probably because he is scum and he didn't know how to react. Who would reply to a non-fundamented accusation with \":( no\", if not clueless scum? Wouldn't it be natural for a townie to react actively -- to be indignated, or amused with the absurdity of the situation?<br>\n <br>\n<br>\n</li><li>In his third and last game relevant post, three days after the last (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5757180#p5757180\">308</a>), NicCage excuses himself saying \"Spring break is just one day away bear with me as I finish giving slow painful birth to one more paper\" and continues to \"promise future content\". This future content has never shown up; you'll notice the only thing he wrote after this was \"I like my avatar :p\" (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5764934#p5764934\">361</a>), as a response to a mod-prod.</li></ul>\n\n<br>\nStill, in his last relevant post, NicCage concluded by saying \"It's easier for me to interact with the game when I'm busy if people interact with me.\" This is probably NicCage's most blatant scumtell. It's obviously difficult for him to build cases on people since he already knows everyone's alignment, so he asks people to address him, so that he has a reason to post.<br>\n<br>\nAnd finally, there's that weird, uncanny emotion-faking again:<br>\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: </b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display:none\"><blockquote><div><cite>NicCage wrote:</cite>Anyhow, it doesn't matter anymore, I'll be all over this tomorrow. <br>\nXoxoxoxo<br>\n~Nic</div></blockquote></div></div></div><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Conclusion</div></div><br>\n<div align=\"center\"><hr style=\"height:14px;width:95%\"></div>Let's recap.

I chose not to address your attempts at justification directly, not because I was \"avoiding confrontation\", but because they are either irrelevant to my point, or they're fallacies, or were just asking for me to repeat the same argument. And I expect people to notice this kind of rhetorical, contentless arguments, including their author (you).<br>\n<br>\nBut since you keep bringing this up, I will give you some examples that may enlighten you. For instance, you said:<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Freak wrote:</cite>We're already past this. You made the exact same point in 26, to which I replied in 28.</div></blockquote>\nThis is true, you replied to me in 28, saying: \"undo, how about this: I agree with him. I was trying too hard to come up with something to say. And I like to keep my one-liners to a higher standard, so any feedback is appreciated.\"<br>\n<br>\nI read this reply, it didn't convince me. Full stop. I don't need to hear any more explanations. I told you this explicitly in that post you just quoted: \"You've already replied to me, and you were not convincing.\" You have to understand that the fact that you reply to someone's accusation doesn't necessarily mean that person has to believe you or dismiss his case on you. <br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Freak wrote:</cite>In #28 I said I agreed with his observation and didn't really see the big deal in writing it in my post. You seem to think otherwise, so I'll ask you: why should I have made a big deal about it? I want a direct answer to this question in your reply.</div></blockquote>\nIn this example, you are clearly asking me to repeat my point about your recanting, which I had already very clearly stated in post 26.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Freak wrote:</cite>On the counter-accusation: you're referring to 67, where people that can read will see that I actually was accusing you of incoherence and not of building contentless discussion.</div></blockquote>\n\nAnd your post 67 reads:\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><blockquote><div><cite>undo wrote:</cite>We&#8217;re trying to build serious discussion. Building discussion on contentless, random comments isn&#8217;t useful.</div></blockquote>\nThen why are you doing it?</div></blockquote>\nSo yes, you *were* accusing me of building discussion on contentless comments after I accused you of the same thing. Your accusation of incoherence is naturally implied. But the worst part is, you know very well I was building discussion on <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">your reaction</div> to contentless comments, not on the comments themselves. You were aware that you were being dishonest on your accusation, but you did it all the same, for it seems your goal was (and still is) not to be logical and constructive but to try to disorient me - disorienting the whole town at the same time.<br>\n<br>\nSee, normally I don't really have the patience to respond to this kind of manipulative, sophist arguments. I did it this once <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">exceptionally</div> to see if you will stop trying to use that against me, because frankly it's getting old and disagreeable.<br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Freak wrote:</cite>then he needs another target. he already distanced himself from doc, so he can't do it on bella. there's only another big target left, but there's not much to say about him because he's lurking, so he goes csi on stuff like the smileys he uses. because that's what's left to undo: giving the impression that he builds long asses cases on bullshit because it's his style, and not because he's scum.</div></blockquote>\nGood effort, but you got it wrong on two important details:<br>\n<br>\n1) I take my votes seriously and that's why I resort to building long cases<br>\n2) My cases aren't built on \"bullshit\", as any reasonable person can testify by reading them. I've said this already, but I'll repeat (and again, I hope I won't have to do it again after this post): you can argue my cases aren't strong (absta did it, for example) -- that's fair, we are here to discuss. But saying they're \"built on bullshit\" is just immature.<br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\nYou see, Freak, ultimately your case against me is solely founded on your biased interpretation of my actions. It is purely based on subjective views, there are no actual <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">facts</div> to support it. That's certainly what Aegor meant when he said \"no-one presented specific in-game reasons for thinking that undo is scum\".<br>\n<br>\nMy cases, on the other hand, are founded on actual facts of the game, that are indisputable, that everyone can witness and validate (NicCage's postcount, for example, or the fact that you were always posting defensively). That is what makes my cases <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">valid</div>. I then interpret those facts through my own subjective views, so that people can compare their own perspective with mine, and that is what will make my case either weak or strong, depending on how well my interpretation matches other people's perspective. But the case will always be valid as long as it is based on unquestionable facts.<br>\n<br>\nI hope I've made myself clear on this.", "time": "Fri Mar 28, 2014 12:44 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=41311&start=500", "forum": "53", "thread": "41311"}

There was never any serious momentum behind a CD lynch and there were better options - without the benefit of hindsight, if you were happy voting CD, then you should have been happy voting NicCage, who was closer to a lynch if your motivation was to avoid a no lynch and had a similar case made against him.</div></blockquote>\n\nAnd I never said anything about you saying it was a bad lynch. I simply asked if you had been following along in order to understand the basis for the votes. I also didn't like the NicCage wagon because of the people on it. You, undo and CD were on it. CD flipped scum and was someone I wasn't thrilled with from the time I replaced in. Undo has been my top scumread since D1. Yours and Fate's posting has done little to inspire any confidence in me.

I guess it was too subtle. Sorry. I'll try and spell things out really slowly in the future.<br>\n<br>\nUnlike you, I've actually gone and done my research. I found one game in which you played with Fate in which he used exactly the approach he uses here. Regardless of the hyperbole of the \"you clearly haven't played with Fate before\" statement, you're at least clearly unfamiliar with how Fate works. Fate's approach is to establish himself as the Alpha Male through yelling loudly, making bold and certain statements and using colorful turns of phrase. Regardless of alignment, this approach is designed to get people to concentrate on what he wants - either the people he suspects of being scum or the people he wants to mislynch. Only once he has done that will he then resort to such things as \"logic\" and case building, and even then if you look at it, he tends to draw on other people's posting in order to do that. In this case, he wasn't in the game long enough to reach that phase of game play - and for a good chunk, I'm pretty sure he was v/la so would have been mostly keeping his activity level up.<br>\n<br>\nIn other words, whatever reasoning you have for finding him scummy isn't actually a reason to find him scummy. It's other things - like stating that he thinks I'm scum.", "time": "Thu Apr 10, 2014 2:41 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=41311&start=875", "forum": "53", "thread": "41311"}

You can see me using it in oldy mafia if you'd like (and it was right).<br>\n<br>\nNow I did say prior to 1.5 years ago, he did in that time frame get better and stay in longer/ even manage a win I think. However his recent flake stinks of old CDB. To the best of my knowledge he was in 3 games at the time. This and 2 that are now finished. He was town in one of the finished games and scum in the other. And if I had to wager a guess about what would put him going back onto his old path, it would be being scum in 2 games at once instead of 1, which he learned to handle. But wait you say, he could have flaked for outside lack of time etc! Its possible it was a factor in him falling behind, but I played skype games with him and etc in that window. I was also his scum buddy in the scum game he flaked from and shamed him over it and he definitely didn't go blaming it on a lack of IRL time to me.", "time": "Sat Apr 19, 2014 1:45 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=41311&start=1075", "forum": "53", "thread": "41311"}
