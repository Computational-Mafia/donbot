underline\"><span style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;\">General Rules</span></span></span><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic\">1) Starting and Ending States:</span> All roles that can communicate at night may do during pregame. The game will end when one faction has fulfilled its win condition, unless otherwise specified.<br><span style=\"font-style: italic\">2) Day Procedures:</span> Each player may discuss the game and cast a single vote at a time against people they want to lynch. Day ends when either the deadline hits or a strict majority of the votes are on one person.<br><span style=\"font-style: italic\">3) Voting:</span> Votes should be in bold in order for them to count, for instance:<span class=\"noboldsig\"> Vote: xRECKONERx</span>. You may also use the [vote] tags if you desire. If you wish to vote for a different player, you don't need to unvote. As long as I can tell who you're voting for, I don't care if you abbreviate someone's name when you vote them.<br><span style=\"font-style: italic\">3b) Voting Formatting:</span> We are beta testing an automatic vote counter this game... this means that we have to adhere to strict formatting. <span class=\"noboldsig\">Put a colon (:) after the word \"Vote\".</span> The vote counter will miss it if you don't. Also, <span class=\"noboldsig\">use full usernames</span> or at least something very close. The vote counter will attempt to match an attempted vote with a playername and find the closest match, but if it's too far off, it won't count it. <br><span style=\"font-style: italic\">4) No Lynch:</span> As an alternative to voting for someone, you may Vote: No Lynch, but for it to take effect, enough players must vote No Lynch that it would be impossible to form any other majority.<br><span style=\"font-style: italic\">5) Deadlines:</span> D1 deadline will be 3 weeks. Every day from then on will have a strict deadline of 2 weeks, unless I deem game issues have caused the need for an extension. I will try to keep a deadline warning in every vote count, but if I don't, it's your job to check the day start post to keep track of the deadline.<br><span style=\"font-style: italic\">6) Mass Inactivity: </span>In an act of pure villainy, I may shorten the deadline if I deem the activity level is unsatisfactory. You will be warned if I want you fellows to pick up the pace before I shorten the deadline.<br><span style=\"font-style: italic\">7) Deadline Lynches:</span> If no single player has enough votes for a lynch at the deadline, the result is No Lynch and the game proceeds to Night. Deadlines are there for a reason.<br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic\">8) Twilight:</span> After someone receives the majority vote, everyone may still discuss the game, but votes and unvotes will not be considered - the person voted for by the majority will be lynched regardless. Twilight will last until I waltz in and post a death scene (which can be quite short, but never really long)<br><span style=\"font-style: italic\">9) Night Length and Procedures:</span> The topic will be locked at Night. If your Role PM specifies that you have a Night Action, you may follow the instructions on that PM to use it. Barring extenuating circumstances, nights will not last longer than 3 RL days.<br><span style=\"font-style: italic\">9b) Accelerated Nights:</span> If every player in the game PMs me and says they wish to speed up the night phase, I will end it once all PMs are in. <br><span style=\"font-style: italic\">10) Night Action Resubmission:</span> If you have to PM a choice to the mod (i.e. the name of someone you want to kill/protect/investigate), you may change your choice at any time during the Night by sending The Mod another PM with the new choice. The most recent choice will be honored when night deadline hits, or when the last PM for accelerating night is in.<br><span style=\"font-style: italic\">11) Night Action Priority:</span> This game will use <a href=\"http://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Natural_Action_Resolution\" class=\"postlink\">natural action resolution</a>, unless otherwise stated by the mod. <br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic\">12) Bolding Stuff:</span> Bolding something is how you get the mod to notice it. It's that simple.<br><span style=\"font-style: italic\">13) Mod Color:</span> If The Mods needs to edit your post, it will be done in <span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #00BF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">bolded, green font</span></span></span>. Don't impersonate me, or I'll cut off your thumbs and feed them to you.<br><span style=\"font-style: italic\">14) Activity, Prods, and Replacements:</span> You will be prodded if three days have passed since your last post. If I check in and you had, say, 80 hours of inactivity but you've since posted, you will not be issued a prod... but I check in pretty frequently. If you are prodded three times or do not respond to a prod within 24 hours (meaning posting in thread), you will be replaced.<br><span style=\"font-style: italic\">14b) Vacation / Limited Access:</span> Real life comes up and mafia games take a long time. If you're going to be inactive for an extended amount of time, feel free to post a <span class=\"noboldsig\">V/LA</span> in thread. However, in order for the V/LA to be recognized, please be sure to set your inactivity in your UCP (User Control Panel -&gt; Vacation / Limited Access tab) as prods/activity checks are done from the Activity Overview.<br><span style=\"font-style: italic\">15) \"Last Words\" for replacements:</span> If you request replacement, you may PM me a message that you would like to have passed on to the person who replaces you.<br><span style=\"font-style: italic\">16) \"Bah!\" Posts:</span> If your player slot is killed off, it's probably because people don't want you around. Unless your role specifically states you can keep talking/voting/playing Monopoly with me, you are allowed one informationless \"bah\" post and then scram til endgame. Special mechanics can of course overlap.<br><span style=\"font-style: italic\">17) Outside Discussion:</span> Don't discuss this game outside of this thread with anyone unless your Role PM lets you do otherwise.<br><span style=\"font-style: italic\">18) Post Editing:</span> Editing or deleting posts is not allowed (and usually not possible). Doublepost with your changes instead. I will modkill for a single abuse of this rule.<br><span style=\"font-style: italic\">19a) Mod and PM quoting:</span> For role PMs, If you quote it, you will be modkilled. You can send me the reformulation (I'm pretty loose with reformulation) and I will tell you if posting it is allowed or if it needs further modifications. If you quote a PM from me, you will be terminated (barring questions about rules or something). I would advise avoiding discussion related to role PM wording as that's a quick way for a flurry of modkills to hit the game.<br><span style=\"font-style: italic\">19b) QTs and Private Communication:</span> If it is a moderator provided method of communication (i.e., neighbor QT, or masons who can daytalk and use AIM) do not quote it in the thread. Obviously, do not provide links to the QT in any way shape or form.<br><span style=\"font-style: italic\">20) Modkills:</span> Breaking any of the above rules (or flagrantly violating Rule 16) will result in you getting modkilled. Modkills can be retroactive. If a living player breaks any of these rules, the day may or may not end, depending on what would disadvantage that player's faction the most. In addition, getting modkilled results in an instant loss for that player, along with my general hatred. In short, follow the rules, don't be a dick.<br><span style=\"font-style: italic\">21) Small/Invisible text:</span> You may use smaller text if it amuses you, as long as it's not meant to bypass a rule. As in, no hidden messages or shit like that. I will fuck you up for fucking with my game.<br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic\">22) Win Mentality:</span> Play to win.<br><span style=\"font-style: italic\">23) Policy:</span> Have fun. Or else. And remember, it's a game - keep it classy and don't take things personally; everyone's doing what they have to to win.<br><span style=\"font-style: italic\">24) Setup Design:</span> You can try to outguess the mod, but it's probably pointless.<br><span style=\"font-style: italic\">25) Flavor:</span> This is a normal game, and as such, will have minimal flavor unless I'm feeling particularly in the mood.<br><br><div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: Sample VT PM</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display: none;\">Hello, and welcome to Mini 1560!<br><br>You are a <span class=\"noboldsig\">vanilla townie</span>.

It's always helpful to post one's reads on other players.<br><br>So, Jordan, this is what I have to say about Doc Holliday:<br><br>I find it strange that Doc considered CDB to be \"probTown\" just because of post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5745388#p5745388\">36</a> which, while certainly interesting for page 2 discussion, wasn\u2019t <span style=\"font-style: italic\">that</span> indicative of a pro-town perspective. Besides, it was CDB's first post, and I can't really comprehend how Doc could already tell that \"CDB [was] putting clear effort into sorting the good from the bad\".<br><br>Then he snaps on post <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5746454#p5746454\">78</a> (\"To the people that have been saying I have bad reasoning, or haven't explained, or whatever else, fuck you.\") This can be perceived as nervousness, but its aggressive nature (rather than defensive) makes it more difficult to infer in which side he is on.<br><br>His case on you (Jordan) is not strong either. While votehopping can be a scumtell, you proved to be consistent in your, erm, erraticness. I doubt scum would post so carelessly as you do.<br><br>In conclusion, while Doc is far from being a confirmed townie, he doesn't give me enough reasons to have particular suspicions on him as of yet. But I am eagerly awaiting his return to see what he has to say about the last pages of the game."}

Isn't that a pretty weak excuse to unvote the scummiest player of the game?

He only says \" <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\"> no. So you like Doc?\" which again looks so artificial. He tries to add some emotion with that emoticon, but we just can tell there's none there -- probably because he is scum and he didn't know how to react.

This future content has never shown up; you'll notice the only thing he wrote after this was \"I like my avatar :p\" (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5764934#p5764934\">361</a>), as a response to a mod-prod.</li></ul><br><br>Still, in his last relevant post, NicCage concluded by saying \"It's easier for me to interact with the game when I'm busy if people interact with me.\" This is probably NicCage's most blatant scumtell.

Isn't that a pretty weak excuse to unvote the scummiest player of the game? Notice the use of the superlative -- Freak didn't say he thought I was scummy, he said I was <span style=\"font-style: italic\">the scummiest</span>. Doesn't that seem off?<br><br>But since nobdy gave an alate excrement about Freak's scumtells (also because his play as scum as greatly improved over the last pages, something I can only congratulate him in all fairness), I see myself forced to move on to other targets.<br><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"font-style: italic\">NicCage's play</span></span><br><div align=\"center\"><hr style=\"height:14px; width:95%\"></div>I've done a quick reread and for now my best bet is <span class=\"noboldsig\">NicCage</span>. He has contributed less than CDB in quantity, and yet he is much more readable. Let's see:<br><br><ul><li>He made a total of 6 posts, from which <span style=\"font-style: italic\">three</span> (3) are game-relevant.<br><br>  </li><li>In his first game-relevant post (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5749782#p5749782\">156</a>), following a prod-dodge the day before, he jumps on Doc's early wagon (Doc was the one with most votes at the time), with very unnatural formulations: <div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: </b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display: none;\"><blockquote><div><cite>NicCage wrote:</cite>Grrrr mad Doc.

Hopefully later.\" He never did get to those.<br>  <br></li><li>His next post (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5750533#p5750533\">171</a>) his a prompt reply to Fate's short \"NicCage+CDB; one more scum to catch\". He only says \" <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\"> no. So you like Doc?\" which again looks so artificial. He tries to add some emotion with that emoticon, but we just can tell there's none there -- probably because he is scum and he didn't know how to react. Who would reply to a non-fundamented accusation with \":( no\", if not clueless scum? Wouldn't it be natural for a townie to react actively -- to be indignated, or amused with the absurdity of the situation?<br> <br></li><li>In his third and last game relevant post, three days after the last (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5757180#p5757180\">308</a>), NicCage excuses himself saying \"Spring break is just one day away bear with me as I finish giving slow painful birth to one more paper\" and continues to \"promise future content\". This future content has never shown up; you'll notice the only thing he wrote after this was \"I like my avatar :p\" (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5764934#p5764934\">361</a>), as a response to a mod-prod.</li></ul><br><br>Still, in his last relevant post, NicCage concluded by saying \"It's easier for me to interact with the game when I'm busy if people interact with me.\" This is probably NicCage's most blatant scumtell. It's obviously difficult for him to build cases on people since he already knows everyone's alignment, so he asks people to address him, so that he has a reason to post.<br><br>And finally, there's that weird, uncanny emotion-faking again:<br><div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: </b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display: none;\"><blockquote><div><cite>NicCage wrote:</cite>Anyhow, it doesn't matter anymore, I'll be all over this tomorrow. <br>Xoxoxoxo<br>~Nic</div></blockquote></div></div></div><br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Conclusion</span></span><br><div align=\"center\"><hr style=\"height:14px; width:95%\"></div>Let's recap.

And I expect people to notice this kind of rhetorical, contentless arguments, including their author (you).<br><br>But since you keep bringing this up, I will give you some examples that may enlighten you. For instance, you said:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Freak wrote:</cite>We're already past this. You made the exact same point in 26, to which I replied in 28.</div></blockquote><br>This is true, you replied to me in 28, saying: \"undo, how about this: I agree with him.

Full stop. I don't need to hear any more explanations. I told you this explicitly in that post you just quoted: \"You've already replied to me, and you were not convincing.\" You have to understand that the fact that you reply to someone's accusation doesn't necessarily mean that person has to believe you or dismiss his case on you. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Freak wrote:</cite>In #28 I said I agreed with his observation and didn't really see the big deal in writing it in my post. You seem to think otherwise, so I'll ask you: why should I have made a big deal about it?

Building discussion on contentless, random comments isn\u2019t useful.</div></blockquote><br>Then why are you doing it?</div></blockquote><br>So yes, you *were* accusing me of building discussion on contentless comments after I accused you of the same thing. Your accusation of incoherence is naturally implied. But the worst part is, you know very well I was building discussion on <span style=\"font-style: italic\">your reaction</span> to contentless comments, not on the comments themselves. You were aware that you were being dishonest on your accusation, but you did it all the same, for it seems your goal was (and still is) not to be logical and constructive but to try to disorient me - disorienting the whole town at the same time.<br><br>See, normally I don't really have the patience to respond to this kind of manipulative, sophist arguments. I did it this once <span class=\"noboldsig\">exceptionally</span> to see if you will stop trying to use that against me, because frankly it's getting old and disagreeable.<br><br>---<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Freak wrote:</cite>then he needs another target. he already distanced himself from doc, so he can't do it on bella. there's only another big target left, but there's not much to say about him because he's lurking, so he goes csi on stuff like the smileys he uses. because that's what's left to undo: giving the impression that he builds long asses cases on bullshit because it's his style, and not because he's scum.</div></blockquote><br>Good effort, but you got it wrong on two important details:<br><br>1) I take my votes seriously and that's why I resort to building long cases<br>2) My cases aren't built on \"bullshit\", as any reasonable person can testify by reading them. I've said this already, but I'll repeat (and again, I hope I won't have to do it again after this post): you can argue my cases aren't strong (absta did it, for example) -- that's fair, we are here to discuss. But saying they're \"built on bullshit\" is just immature.<br><br>---<br><br>You see, Freak, ultimately your case against me is solely founded on your biased interpretation of my actions. It is purely based on subjective views, there are no actual <span style=\"font-style: italic\">facts</span> to support it. That's certainly what Aegor meant when he said \"no-one presented specific in-game reasons for thinking that undo is scum\".<br><br>My cases, on the other hand, are founded on actual facts of the game, that are indisputable, that everyone can witness and validate (NicCage's postcount, for example, or the fact that you were always posting defensively). That is what makes my cases <span style=\"font-style: italic\">valid</span>. I then interpret those facts through my own subjective views, so that people can compare their own perspective with mine, and that is what will make my case either weak or strong, depending on how well my interpretation matches other people's perspective. But the case will always be valid as long as it is based on unquestionable facts.<br><br>I hope I've made myself clear on this."}

Post 107 builds on a lot of weak reasons (some extreme stretches, like a) that might have held true 5 years ago as simple scumtells but have no business being thrown around today and then throws out that line.

I guess it was too subtle. Sorry. I'll try and spell things out really slowly in the future.<br><br>Unlike you, I've actually gone and done my research. I found one game in which you played with Fate in which he used exactly the approach he uses here. Regardless of the hyperbole of the \"you clearly haven't played with Fate before\" statement, you're at least clearly unfamiliar with how Fate works. Fate's approach is to establish himself as the Alpha Male through yelling loudly, making bold and certain statements and using colorful turns of phrase. Regardless of alignment, this approach is designed to get people to concentrate on what he wants - either the people he suspects of being scum or the people he wants to mislynch. Only once he has done that will he then resort to such things as \"logic\" and case building, and even then if you look at it, he tends to draw on other people's posting in order to do that. In this case, he wasn't in the game long enough to reach that phase of game play - and for a good chunk, I'm pretty sure he was v/la so would have been mostly keeping his activity level up.<br><br>In other words, whatever reasoning you have for finding him scummy isn't actually a reason to find him scummy. It's other things - like stating that he thinks I'm scum."}

At all. It was completely just off.<br>Second, Bella never actually opened up herself to \"questioning.\" Do you ask everyone who ever makes a meta read the same questions? If so, stop doing that because you're being a useless hassle and fucking annoying.<br>Finally, if you DO want to understand a player's meta, the burden is on YOU, not anyone else, to do the requisite reading to understand it.<br><br>So yes, your case does, in fact, hinge on you didn't want to do the heavy lifting and Bella wouldn't do it for you. Why isn't anyone else in this game scummy for not challenging the way Fate was posting but also not providing you with \"Hey, this is how Fate posts. See X.\" ? Like, your case is specifically attributing the fact that Bella chose to speak up instead of anyone else about Fate's playstyle.<br><br>So do you want to give up on this one or keep trying to squirm out of reasons."}

For example; The world is flat and at the end of it there are huge waterfalls that never end 'Uh please back that up' 'Go find out yourselves!!!'.<br><br>I just don't know what to think anymore!</div></blockquote><br><br>No. The scenario you posit is one in which the evidence does not exist either way - in that situation, the burden of proof would lie with me. That is not the case. The evidence for Fate's meta does exist - it's in every goddamn game he's played. It is simply a question of going and looking for it and not being lazy and expecting other people to do your job for you. You will, however, also note that you are the only one disputing my description of Fate's style of play. There are other people in this game who are familiar with Fate and his play style. Guess how many of them have raised any issue with my description? <br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>The point is that I was looking to see where Bella got her opinion from and instead of getting an answer I am told to find out myself which is just nonsense because obviously I am not going to do that.<br>1.

It is open to interpretation as the situation exists wherein Bella believes but I don't even looking at the same game therefore it is possible never to find it even when Bella believes it.<br>3.

You can see me using it in oldy mafia if you'd like (and it was right).<br><br>Now I did say prior to 1.5 years ago, he did in that time frame get better and stay in longer/ even manage a win I think. However his recent flake stinks of old CDB. To the best of my knowledge he was in 3 games at the time. This and 2 that are now finished. He was town in one of the finished games and scum in the other. And if I had to wager a guess about what would put him going back onto his old path, it would be being scum in 2 games at once instead of 1, which he learned to handle. But wait you say, he could have flaked for outside lack of time etc! Its possible it was a factor in him falling behind, but I played skype games with him and etc in that window. I was also his scum buddy in the scum game he flaked from and shamed him over it and he definitely didn't go blaming it on a lack of IRL time to me."}

Both roles have utility as scum, are very powerful independently and interact very painfully with each other for the scum.<br><br>Both of them targeting me last night is extremely odd from my POV. They are effectively protection variants(as town roles) and I felt like I was in 0 danger of getting shot. Can some non-PRs talk about who they expected as a nightkill? I don't expect that I'm undervaluing myself as an NK target, but it's possible. On the other hand I don't feel like I had implied I was a PR where UT had outright claimed to be one, so roleblocking me is of little scum value, and watching me only has utility if you expect that I'm going to be investigated or protected, which also seem unlikely as priories.<br><br>As scum I'd expect that UT would have shot zdenek, or watched him if he feared a protective role stopping the kill, neither of which happened.

Agar hadn't said anything about CoolDog up to that point and he was scum reading Aegor. After Aegor voted CD, Agar complemented the vote and pushed CoolDog as scum. As scum it would have been really easy for Aegor to refuse to vote for CoolDog, since his scum read Aegor jumped on the wagon and he wasn't locked in to any particular stance on CoolDog at the point.
