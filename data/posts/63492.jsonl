But if I've learned anything from SU it's that there is a distinct, yet minor difference between your scum and town styles. And no, I am certainly not claiming to have attained a solid meta-read on you already. But I am claiming to severely dislike <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7251063#p7251063\">38</a>.<br><br>Actually the record for that is 1-1.

It's not about how scummy one appears, but how likely they are to flip scum based on their reputation. Luna has no finished games, and so far has displayed nothing but baseline scummy behaviour, which makes it more likely that she will flip scum over someone like Sonic who is known to play scummily regardless of alignment. It's really got nothing to do with how strong my respective reads are."}

I think it's more just a Ricastle thing with me in general. We have a fun but competitive history, and I think he's a bit paranoid about me, which actually firms up my town read on him further.

Or at least, that's my opinion.<br><br>I've played IC and completely ruined the game myself, I realize how the psychology around them works, both myself and the person I was replacing had generated strong antipathy from the town at large, and despite myself calling all 3 of the scum I guess I wasn't convincing enough. <br><br>I'm just over that game.

But if I submitted them one at a time and we lynched accordingly, if the three scum were A Simple Plan, Bins, and Davsto, it would be 100%. The only way it could be 33.33% is if the three scum were the last three mentioned. In which case, if that remained a running trend, it would eventually become near 100% if we were to lynch in reverse order! And if it's consistently higher than 33.33%, then the average hit rate would be high anyway! What do you make of that, eh?!"}

As town, usually you just read them, you don't say, \"I'm going to give this person x or y read\"...that read just develops over time based off what they say and do, and it is what it is. The way you say you are \"giving\" (or likely not giving in this case) someone a read sounds like the read is forced. Maybe it's just a wording thing, IDK, but that's what I picked up on.</div></blockquote><br>What if I say that post was a referring to a finished game?"}

We should make lynch 1 happen in the next 2 days so we can discuss lynch 2 without scrambling. Anyone with a strong scumread on any of these players should consolidate it for me because there really aren't any that I found very convincing in my readthrough of D2."}

That doesn't change or answer anything I said. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7309938#p7309938\" class=\"postlink\">post 1391</a>, Ankamius wrote:</cite>No, it's not. I specifically wanted to see if you had anything to say after you voted me; the fact that you specifically didn't try to get me to fill in the blanks before just making up nonsense to put in there instead doesn't sit right with me at all.</div></blockquote>Now you're raising an entirely different point. Your previous post came with the implication that I voted you after you voted me; otherwise, it would make absolutely no sense whatsoever. I've never been clueless as to why you voted me - I've always considered it to be pretty obvious. So I really don't get what you were saying there or how this relates to it.<br><br>Again, WHAT have I made up? It really annoys me when people make this accusation because it's almost always a buzzterm.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7309938#p7309938\" class=\"postlink\">post 1391</a>, Ankamius wrote:</cite>If you can't show that your reads changed at that point, then your response to my point about your read on ASP's posting changing is bogus.</div></blockquote>Lmao. First off, it's logic 101 that if one of the only three people I am not townreading in some capacity flips town, and there are three scum alive, then one or more of the people I was townreading is actually scum. I don't need to show anything. It's a literal fact that my reads would have changed to some extent.<br><br>Secondly, I never said I liked ASP's posting. You actually seem to be intentionally painting this narrative considering I debunked this myth in my last response. ASP's play was very bad, the worst in the game, in fact. But no matter how bad one's play is, it always has a possibility of coming from town, and if there is evidence to believe so, a replacement in this instance, then I'll accept that the previous slot's play was simply bad town. If I believe that replacement's play is scummy, however, then I sure as shit will bring up the previous slot's bad play as a point against them. That is the volatile nature of such play.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7309921#p7309921\" class=\"postlink\">post 1389</a>, Ricastle wrote:</cite>Because my last few posts in response to you weren't exactly that, right?</div></blockquote>I meant this specific point, obviously. Good lord.<br><br>You seem more invested in winding your way around my arguments using whatever means possible rather than actually pushing your own through.

This all adds up to the prime definition of covert coasting.<br><br>AND you replaced into the ASP slot, or in other words, the worst content in the game for obvious and previously pointed out reasons.<br><br>If anyone has objections to this lynch, I'd love to hear them; but with how this slot has behaved as a whole, I doubt many, if any will be arising.</div></blockquote><br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Ricastle</span></div></blockquote></div></blockquote>You cannot be serious.<br><br>YOU JUST PROVED MY FUCKING POINT.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7317383#p7317383\" class=\"postlink\">post 1547</a>, Ankamius wrote:</cite>What is right smack in the middle? <span class=\"noboldsig\">BBMolla's replace-in and gambit.</span> You posted twice in the middle of that whole debacle, and your entire contribution to it was trying to fish out all the information about the claim that you could. The moment I saw that, I immediately got the sense that you had ulterior motives for trying to fish the claim since I can't see town wanting to fish out the details of a claim that comes out of basically nowhere, but I can definitely see scum doing this because they know the slot isn't part of their team.</div></blockquote>My inquiry was wether Molla was even-night or not. If you were reading the game at all, you would know that MS claimed odd-night Doctor. Do you HONESTLY not see why I would find it a necessity to clarify his claim in such a scenario? No, you're not stupid, clearly, and you are reading. And so remains one option. You are <span class=\"noboldsig\">scum</span> who knows that the only way they can win this argument is by hiding, twisting, and intentionally misinterpreting the facts regarding the events that have occurred. Simple as fucking that."}

Need more.<br><br>Ankamius has minimal content but a ton of it leans scum; particularly the fact that he hasn't put me under any pressure. In our first game together I got him lynched when he was the cop inno and the next one he was super paranoid about me and I still won. He would be all over me if he was town; like, he was throwing out comments every time someone said I had done something towny about how they shouldn't put stock in it because \"RC can fake that.\"<br><br>Metal Sonic has me resigned to the fact that I can't read players like him and Boonskiies. He's being genuine but that may be entirely not alignment indicative because he may not be thinking of this as a scum game so much as a social activity so it's difficult for me to get any traction on the read.<br><br>Aristophanes is like eh because I want to think he's scum but there's so much against him being scum. There's definitely a passivity to his tone and play which I recognize as being incredibly similar to when he replaced into my slot in 1708; so much so that I'm surprised he didn't get under a lot more pressure in either game. However, I don't really know his town play so I don't have a read as strong as my Ank read. I also note that he replaced the Layla slot, and the way it replaced out was extremely town.<br><br>Luna Fox is still a very strong scumread but I want to go for Ankamius first for two reasons: 1) I feel like scum will already have made an effort to make her flip less alignment indicative on their behalves because of the length of time that I've been pushing her and 2) the fact that I'm still alive attests to either the scumteam badly underestimating what I'm going to do in LyLo or my reads being wrong. Either way, she can wait.<br><br>Bins is not a lynch candidate for me today."}
