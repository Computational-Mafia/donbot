Arbitrarily saying that \"Policy Lynches are garbage\"  seems like absentminded firestarter.  Also his immediate reaction to me seemed overexcited.  It looks like a pseudo-calculated start.  The three posts in a row especially like he's trying to correct a mistake that he made, and generally speaking, as Town there's no reason to police your own opinions.  That being said I could just me misreading that fact that he was perhaps posting as he was reading the thread, as opposed to finishing the thread then posting comments.  I've done it before.</div></blockquote>\nHmm...<br>\n<br>\n1. What errors am I possibly trying to correct?<br>\n2. Do you believe policy-lynches are a <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">good</div> thing? If so, why?<br>\n3. Was it really arbitrarily?</div></blockquote>\n1. To answer your question, let's live in the world of you being a paranoid scum player, temporarily.  As such, if it was an error, I think it would most likely be you trying to not buddy so obviously with mnemonicdevice as a scumpartner. Since your post came only a minute after mnemonic's, you would try your absolute best to distance yourself from your partner- especially on opening day randomwagons, and as such you immediately regretted your decision, quickly distanced yourself, and then tried to vote him to relieve stress on yourself.  The series of posts, especially with the follow-up to my initial Post 17 simply seemed like someone who was super eager and then realized that they did something really bad.<br>\n<br>\n2. I think there are occasions where they are optimal.  In day-before lylo scenarios, I think lynching extreme lurkers (emphasis on extreme) is often necessary if you can't rely on them to improve by the next  in game day.  The occasions concerning which I get behind a policy lynch are far and few between.  That being said, I have no problem with the factual content of your post, but rather the reasons for your saying it.  Similar to topic 1.), I think the context of your post was interesting.  In such an early part of the game, generally speaking, first post comments are throw away or humorous, at least until further content is procured.  I'm fairly certain Elyse wasn't trying to actually push for a policy lynch. Your response seemed just very pointed for day 1 D1 town play.<br>\n<br>\n3. In reconsideration, 'arbitrary' was a terrible choice of words-  as I stated in 2.), I feel that it was more so unnecessarily <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">pointed.</div><br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5836425#p5836425\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5836425#p5836425\" data-post-id=\"5836425\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 47</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=23438\">bjc</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5836234#p5836234\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5836234#p5836234\" data-post-id=\"5836234\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 45</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=14666\">HearTheLightning</a> wrote:</cite>\nHe hasn't, I'm just being a little sarcastic over the fact that I think that the posts from him that I quoted back in <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5833937#p5833937\" class=\"postlink\">post 17</a> seemed suspicious.</div></blockquote>\nWhy do you feel the need to clarify being sarcastic?

Even if they're scum, getting into fist fights over whether or not I was being sarcastic 9 pages ago just makes for incredibly unhealthy next-day gameplay.  I always want people to understand WHAT I'm saying.  Mafia should be about the WHY.  If we're running in circles about whether I'm lying about my original tone of voice, we most definitely are not going to be getting productive reads.  Secondarily because I don't care about reads on him as of now.  I wanted this discussion to be able to get a follow-up read on you after your interesting stream of posts.  It is most important, in my opinion to get reads on the most vocal members of the game, because those are the people who lead wagons.  As of now that's you and myself.<br>\n- - - - - -<br>\nSide note:  If anyone is morally against long posts I can shorten mine.", "time": "Sun Apr 20, 2014 3:14 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=48071&start=25", "forum": "53", "thread": "48071"}

The problem I had with him was that he seemed rash, especially since he immediately contradicted his previous vote.  It seemed like a \"whoops I would have edited out that vote if I could but that'd be cheating\" type of thing.  Imo, patient scum that get caught answer slowly and precisely.  Rash mafia players that get caught tend to be more defensive and emotionally charged (not even angry, but just focused on the absurdity of their accuser).  Since I was accusing bjc on the basis of being rash mafia, when his response was well structured and logical, it made me rethink.  His immediate response was to ask me questions about my accusation on him.  That is a very *not* defensive move, and mafioso who make rash errors tend to over-justify their actions.  His calm response definitely makes me think that either he quickly composed himself and is playing a solid game as mafia, or that his posts(12-14, etc.) in fact *were* consistent game play for him, and he just doesn't have many issues with quickly changing his opinions.  His quick responses to myself, as well as quips such as:\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5838412#p5838412\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5838412#p5838412\" data-post-id=\"5838412\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 86</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=23438\">bjc</a> wrote:</cite>It's really inappropriate that you smoke weed.</div></blockquote>\nseem to lend to this explanation.  Hence, I'm seeing him as town.<br>\n<br>\n2.)   I didn't change my opinion after getting flak-  my reversed opinion on bjc can be seen in Post 62 (Whip referring to the political role in Congress that gets people to participate).  I was essentially calling him town.  Between post 48 (My initial accusation) and 62 the only person to criticize me was bjc: calling a mafia team of mnemonic and myself, as well as saying he was curious as to why I wasn't voting him.

Arbitrarily saying that \"Policy Lynches are garbage\"  seems like absentminded firestarter.  Also his immediate reaction to me seemed overexcited.  It looks like a pseudo-calculated start.  The three posts in a row especially like he's trying to correct a mistake that he made, and generally speaking, as Town there's no reason to police your own opinions.  That being said I could just me misreading that fact that he was perhaps posting as he was reading the thread, as opposed to finishing the thread then posting comments.

Do you believe policy-lynches are a <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">good</div> thing? If so, why?<br>\n3. Was it really arbitrarily?</div></blockquote>\n1. To answer your question, let's live in the world of you being a paranoid scum player, temporarily.  As such, if it was an error, I think it would most likely be you trying to not buddy so obviously with mnemonicdevice as a scumpartner. Since your post came only a minute after mnemonic's, you would try your absolute best to distance yourself from your partner- especially on opening day randomwagons, and as such you immediately regretted your decision, quickly distanced yourself, and then tried to vote him to relieve stress on yourself.  The series of posts, especially with the follow-up to my initial Post 17 simply seemed like someone who was super eager and then realized that they did something really bad.<br>\n<br>\n2. I think there are occasions where they are optimal.  In day-before lylo scenarios, I think lynching extreme lurkers (emphasis on extreme) is often necessary if you can't rely on them to improve by the next  in game day.  The occasions concerning which I get behind a policy lynch are far and few between.  That being said, I have no problem with the factual content of your post, but rather the reasons for your saying it.  Similar to topic 1.), I think the context of your post was interesting.  In such an early part of the game, generally speaking, first post comments are throw away or humorous, at least until further content is procured.  I'm fairly certain Elyse wasn't trying to actually push for a policy lynch. Your response seemed just very pointed for day 1 D1 town play.\n</div></blockquote>\n\nThis post, less so:<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5837291#p5837291\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5837291#p5837291\" data-post-id=\"5837291\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 58</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=2369\">geraintm</a> wrote:</cite>I have nothing to add.

I feel like the accusation is used more so as disguised ad hominem to discredit the players relevance in the game.<br>\nTo avoid a conversation that I really enjoy having that is a lot of metagame theory- every townie's endgame goal is to lynch mafia, but many people go about it in different ways.  Each of the follow attributes when tied to a townie aid them in lynching mafia:  Appearing townie to other town, being able to lead town, being able to find mafia, being able to find town, being able to find power roles (but usually outing them is a terrible thing), being able to attract bullets as VT, good skills when Cop, etc.  Even if you're terrible at finding mafia, if you can show yourself as an incredibly obvious townie and lead the town well enough that they accept your lynches over less confirmed players, you're essentially removing influence of (possible) mafia players, even if you aren't actively hunting mafia that well.<br>\nI consider my better traits to be finding town and presenting myself as a townie, hence why I stressed my town reads at the beginning of the game, as well as my long posts.

Just for the sake of the situation, let's assume that ger and kush are the same alignment.  If we lynch Ger today, we have no means of actually talking about kush in a way that can inform us about whether we should lynch him or not.  However, if we lynch kush, tomorrow we still have Ger's rather large body of material, as well as what he will say on D2.  If the game keeps rolling as it is, I am relatively confident of the fact that Ger and Kush are going to eventually get lynched.  Generally speaking, for any Day X, Day X+1's lynch has a better chance of hitting mafia due to more posts, and a hopefully better informed town.  That being said, this only happens if the people who get thrown up for a lynch actually have material to discuss.  Kush has none.  As a tendency, D1 lynches are pretty non-accurate.  IMO, it is better to use the D1 lynch on Kush than to use it on Ger.  Ger, while still scummy, and more so actively lurking (That being said the torrent of responses he just made is kind of refreshing) compared to kush's passive lurking, can actually be analyzed and discussed.  A d@ wagon on Ger will be better informed than a D1 wagon on Ger, whereas a D2 wagon on Kush is NOT going to be better informed than a D1 wagon on him.<br>\nI know that Ger has been more insistent about digging his hole, but the dirt he's tossing out of the hole is at least stuff to be examined.  Kush is just kind of sitting on his shovel.<br>\nAlso, post D1 lynches on lurkers turns into just the most horrendously WIFOM-based pissing arguments, and I really, really, really cannot stand arguments that rest on the ground of WIFOM.  Doubt is fine, but at a certain point, people who don't provide content shouldn't be in the game.<br>\n- - - - - -<br>\nCan we stop talking about our collective inabilities to make reads on D1?  SiX and Ger have been sitting on that same idea for so long, and both of them have thoroughly stated how the cant grab reads on D1.  Whether they're lying or not, you're not going to get anything else out of them on the subject.  It would be really great if we started talking about other stuff, like Ger's stream of conscious responses.", "time": "Tue Apr 29, 2014 9:47 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=48071&start=325", "forum": "53", "thread": "48071"}

But \"not participating in day 1\"  is not a valid town strategy.  You're making it more difficult to read you, which distracts the other town players.  Plus, think about it from a metagame standpoint:  if you're scum, you are essentially buying a free mislynch by refusing to participate.  If that became an accepted strategy, day 1 lynches become functionally random and we would be playing day 2 phases with all the problems you hate about day 1.

If he gets replaced out and is a mafia role, we're completely screwed in that the new player essentially gets to start the game halfway into D2 with no criticisms against him.  Kush is incredibly useless to the game, and I frankly, would be terrified to put anyone at L1 this game with him still alive.

In post 82 you said elyse was being a fucktard. Why did she do that made you feel that way or was it arbitrary? We didn't like your interaction with six at all. It seems like you were buddying him hard. Then you made posts 162 and 163. Vonflare is scum then no he's not. What?! This seems like scum just trying to WIFOM. In post 197 he says his scum play is bad. Again a super scummy thing to say. In 206 he's buddying us. Seems like he's trying to form an associative tell. Post 410 he really wants the hammer to come down and then as soon as the next day starts, he's back on elyse. But by post 552 he now trusts elyse and goes with who she's voting. <br>\n<br>\nBasically bjc is letting more and more of his scum shine through the more the game progresses. He's trying to set up something with every player to cover his own ass when he flips scum and his entire play reeks of scum scum scum.

His #4 in that post does mention <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">bjc</div>, in that playing/posting style affecting people's reads too much, that if one doesn't like his posting style he must be Scum. I find that sentiment rather odd, considering his vote is still on me in spite of <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">MME</div> replacing out, and I only have 3 posts before this one. So how exactly that jives in spite of his current stance merits further elaboration. I don't post much because of having a busy life, but I do know analysis, and am strong in that element.<br>\n<br>\nI also notice in that same post his first-pass read in his spoiler. Two people are leaning Scum there. Strangely, he says he's properly leaning Scum on one player, but that \"that's 2 more scum not posting enough.\" So, he has two people leaning Scum in his reads list, yet he suspects one player and has two other people who aren't posting enough he thinks are Scum. Which begs the question: Does <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Wolfy</div> believe there are two or three Scum in this game? His reads list and his subsequent comment in that post don't mesh.<br>\n<br>\nMore reasoning for why <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Wolfy</div> suspected <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">geraintm</div> would be helpful.

Well, I was going to quote where I talked about my stance on him, but apparently I didn't go over him as much as I thought I did. <br>\n<br>\nLike I said, I'm a little torn. I see stuff that makes me feel he's scum, but I see plenty more that says otherwise. Could he be scum? Yeah, definitely. Is he scum? If it came down to it, I wouldn't vote him. Not at this point in the game.

She feels just like Flitter Hills, where she was town and we broke the game together.</div></blockquote> Hmmm... I'm a little torn on Elyse myself. That's why Ger is the \"safe'' lynch in my opinion. Elyse doesn't seem the same as the game I played with her not long ago. I was scum, and I decided to rolecop her because I felt like (based on her reactions) that she was holding a PR. She ended up being a JK, but I digress...<br>\n<br>\nI'm just afraid she could be playing differently due to lack of interest, having a VT role, being scum etc. Hell, I myself am not overly active in this game and it took me half a week to do what I kept promising I'd do. So at this point, I feel like we're going to fall into the trap of doing a crapshoot lynch like yesterday. That means guys like ger and kush are the targets, and kush seems to be the one most are trying to crumb/go after. It just sets alarms off in my head because it's too easy, and it's too similar to a PL for my liking. That's actually one of the only reasons I'm worried about HtL in the first place: he keeps trying to push the PL angle, as does Ger. <br>\n<br>\ntl;dr I think we should lynch SM or Ger after interacting with you. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">vote: Slainte Mhath</div>", "time": "Sun May 18, 2014 8:33 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=48071&start=600", "forum": "53", "thread": "48071"}

Under any circumstance.  And if we don't lynch him now, when are we ever going to lynch him?  Do you really want someone who wont even read the game choosing between the final townie and mafia member in a 3-man Lylo?  He's obviously not gonna get NK'd, as scum as no reason to get rid of him, and if he's scum, then he's not gonna vote himself.  Sthar can say as much as he wants that cutting your losses is a terrible strategy, but Kush is someone I really, really don't want to deal with on a D3 o D4... we have /no material/ on him.<br>\n<br>\nThat being said, I feel like the sudden increase on Kush's wagon is super scum-opportunistic.  It's less than 24 hours to end of day, and scum want an easy miss.  If the Kush lynch goes through, then I would DEFINITELY look at the people on this wagon.<br>\n<br>\nYet again, if we are at L-1 and need a lynch I will be fine to switch my vote around.  And sorry again for the completely abominable day.

It is to do with scum needing to be x% more proactive than the highest townie and the higher the % gets the harder it is because the bigger the gap the more and more from scums POV is that their work is 'done' so their will to post drops the other factor which can play is being too proactive and not being nked brings questions thus discouraging them from posting.

Then again, I've played in games where it was multiball, 9:2:2, and it wasn't that bad. If it were 3 mafia and one SK, I suppose it's possible, but seems a bit scaled in Scum's favor.

Ger has been criticized over and over again concerning the same points.  If he were to get lynched, the case against him would essentially be \"I think he did [content we already discussed on D1 and D2 in excruciating detail]\"  whereas a lynch on me would require NEW content that has yet to be discussed, which could possibly help town into figuring how who is mafia/who is town based on how the wagon on me turns out.  I'm not a hypocrite-  wagons produce content for town to use in finding scum, and wagons on me are not exempt from this.<br>\nTo expand on this-  each Day, to simplify, has two goals.<br>\n1.  To find and lynch scum for that day.<br>\n2.  To create content to be analyzed the NEXT day so as to fulfill goal #1 for the next day.<br>\n The only day where goal 2 is irrelevant is in a lylo situation where there's 1 mafia left.  From a non-me/Ger perspective, we both might be scum, but a wagon on him doesn't make any content to be discussed for the next day (\"Hey I think what you said about Ger was very over-eager, you might be scum!\"), because it's all been said.  A wagon on me would bring out new evidence, new suspicions, etc., which are all REALLY healthy for a town that is clearly running severely low on gas.\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5921924#p5921924\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5921924#p5921924\" data-post-id=\"5921924\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 785</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=20873\">Elyse</a> wrote:</cite>@HTL<br>\nYour post hit a lot of red flags, such as the inability to understand why someone would want to lynch you and threatening bjc by asking if he's secure with certain players finding scum.</div></blockquote>\"I would strongly suggest against shooting me, though I can understand why you'd want to.\"  I completely understand why people would want to lynch me-  I think you are misconstruing what I said.

I am not trying to save myself from being lynched, I am trying to better the town for the condition that the game does not end by N3.  For the other half of your statement-  are you really considering that both myself and Ger are scum?  First off-  check the list of standard roles, which one allows me to save Ger from a NK after I've been lynched?  Secondarily if I'm scum there'd be no reason to protect him if he's town, and if he was scum and I was town, I really wouldn't want to protect him, cause I think there's an above average chance of hitting properly on him.  This is a really unfounded paranoia, even if I am scum.<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5921924#p5921924\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5921924#p5921924\" data-post-id=\"5921924\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 785</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=20873\">Elyse</a> wrote:</cite>Then you say you are \"80% sure\" scum is within four players, only ruling out yourself, bjc, and sthar which literally means nothing.<br>\n<br>\nI don't understand why a wagon on MME or Ger wouldn't be productive.

As for MME, it's not that he has no content, it's that the content is in a very weird situation given that there have been two replacements on that specific slot-  despite one being the original.  He has had a huge interim and can kind of be excused for lack of content after getting back into the game.  A wagon on him would be kinda spotty, and I still maintain my town read on the role regardless, so I feel that a wagon would be wasted there.<br>\n---<br>\nI believe that's covered everything.", "time": "Tue Jun 03, 2014 10:34 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=48071&start=775", "forum": "53", "thread": "48071"}

I doesn't promote lurking it promotes shooting lurkers at night.  He dies either way, it's really simple.  \"Promotes lurking\" is an absurd thing to be said about me when literally for the first 2 Days my primary lynch was a lurker who had been producing little to no content.<br>\n<br>\nIt is not \"lynch active players who have content.\"  We have choice A and choice B.  Choice A and Choice B are both going to die.  Choice A has been talked about and re-discussed time and time again.  Choice B has not.  We have two tools of execution, both of with will be used, each on one of Choice A and B.  The first execution tool requires town collaboration and effort/wagoning.  This tool requires discussion and dedication as a whole to be able to commit behind.  As such, it should always be used in a way such that the discussed material helps bring more \"knowledge to the table\" so-to-speak.  Since Choice A has been talked about a ton it is better to use this tool to focus on Choice B.  Talking about Choice B allows the town to gain new perspectives on how outed scum interacted with Choice B, how outed town interacted with Choice B, etc.  Attention being brought to these details can possibly help town in locating scum.  None of these benefits happen if this execution tool is used on Choice A, since it has *already been discussed.*  Luckily, the second execution tool requires no collaboration, and since Choice A has already been discussed in detail, the secondary execution tool can be used to simply remove them from the map of the game.  This is the most efficient way of killing both Choice A and Choice B given the two execution tools provided.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n\"Lynch players with content\" is not the cause for my reference, it is a coincidental happenstance.  What I am saying is \"Lynch the person who has been discussed less.\"  If I was the lurker and he was the one heavy with content (Which is kind of true, to be honest-  at this point Ger has talked about way more things than I have), I would still prefer it this way.  NK people that the town can't decide on/have been discussed a ton yet someone avoided lynches, and use the actual lynch on people who are still considered scummy but haven't been talked about.  Lynches/wagons are tools not only to kill people but to also bring attention to facts, details, etc., that can be used for future lynches.", "time": "Wed Jun 04, 2014 2:04 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=48071&start=775", "forum": "53", "thread": "48071"}

It's incredibly easy for a scum player to posture themselves in expectation of claiming as one or even several roles, and hiding \"hints\" in numerous posts- they prove next to nothing.  I find that upon review of my posts that I should be found to be a player who played very much so a \"control\" game where I was more preoccupied with appearing midrange-ish as a not super-town, but not incredibly scummy.  Unfortunately, the only gameplay that I can link my behavior to is the Slainte check N1.  The fact that upon the later days of D1, I began including SM in my lynchable selection should in itself provide a small amount of verification.  My reasoning was that he seemed to be playing like either a mafia role blocker or doctor.  In my opinion a lot of his analysis looked slightly PR oriented.  I was, however, wrong, and having found him vanilla, I found it easier to believe him to be vanilla town than vanilla scum.  That's also why I dropped my suspicion of him D2.<br>\n<br>\nOtherwise, I find myself to have played a relatively decent game.  I was incredibly lazy D2 and D3, but I think I have ample excuse for it, which is neither her nor there in terms of relevance to this specific game.  That being said, I'm also vaguely martyring myself because I have at most one more check, and it runs vanilla on goons, so I don't even consider myself much of a \"PR\" at this point.", "time": "Fri Jun 06, 2014 12:05 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=48071&start=800", "forum": "53", "thread": "48071"}

Every town power role had highly varying potentials in how useful they'd be; I really wanted them to pay dividends for people who made smart choices with them.  I also wanted to try not to be totally cookie cutter in my allocations.<br>\n<br>\nI liked the idea of the Weak Neighbouriser as it gave its recipient a choice between whether to try and find scum to suicide on, to verify a strong townie to work with, or perhaps shades of the two.  Pim never sent in an action, so that role went nowhere.  Perhaps another time.<br>\n<br>\nThe Odd-Night Role Cop was useful within the confines of this setup, but probably wouldn't be seen as a generally useful PR at all.  I thought out of the town power roles that would be the one to get heat, and it had the potential to be an almost useless role.  However, having the mafia power roles split meant there was more chance of him finding something useful to push on, particularly if it'd got to use its N3 shot and scum were ahead.  <br>\n<br>\nVigilante can be fairly anti-town; in this case it was used fairly sensibly, but things could have gone a different way.  It puts a lot of power in one person's hands!  I mainly included this one for the fun factor and to keep mafia on their toes.<br>\n<br>\nMafia-wise, the power roles were split so as to not centralise them in one spot, and to add ciphers for the Role Cop to find.  The Tracker was only truly reliable at clearing Vig prospects, and the RB was also only reliably useful for locking down the Vig -- if the situation called for it, of course.  Whilst neither PR would be auto-guilty to the Role Cop if scanned, I felt it should make them see them as more likely guilty than not if they'd thought about things a little.  <br>\n<br>\nI'm happy enough with it for my first outing, I think!  Thanks for playing.  I may venture a themed game next time... we'll see.", "time": "Tue Jun 10, 2014 10:25 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=48071&start=825", "forum": "53", "thread": "48071"}
