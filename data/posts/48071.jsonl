Do you believe policy-lynches are a <span style=\"font-style: italic\">good</span> thing? If so, why?<br>3. Was it really arbitrarily?</div></blockquote><br>1. To answer your question, let's live in the world of you being a paranoid scum player, temporarily.  As such, if it was an error, I think it would most likely be you trying to not buddy so obviously with mnemonicdevice as a scumpartner. Since your post came only a minute after mnemonic's, you would try your absolute best to distance yourself from your partner- especially on opening day randomwagons, and as such you immediately regretted your decision, quickly distanced yourself, and then tried to vote him to relieve stress on yourself.  The series of posts, especially with the follow-up to my initial Post 17 simply seemed like someone who was super eager and then realized that they did something really bad.<br><br>2. I think there are occasions where they are optimal.  In day-before lylo scenarios, I think lynching extreme lurkers (emphasis on extreme) is often necessary if you can't rely on them to improve by the next  in game day.  The occasions concerning which I get behind a policy lynch are far and few between.  That being said, I have no problem with the factual content of your post, but rather the reasons for your saying it.  Similar to topic 1.), I think the context of your post was interesting.  In such an early part of the game, generally speaking, first post comments are throw away or humorous, at least until further content is procured.  I'm fairly certain Elyse wasn't trying to actually push for a policy lynch. Your response seemed just very pointed for day 1 D1 town play.<br><br>3. In reconsideration, 'arbitrary' was a terrible choice of words-  as I stated in 2.), I feel that it was more so unnecessarily <span style=\"font-style: italic\">pointed.</span><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5836425#p5836425\" class=\"postlink\">post 47</a>, bjc wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5836234#p5836234\" class=\"postlink\">post 45</a>, HearTheLightning wrote:</cite>He hasn't, I'm just being a little sarcastic over the fact that I think that the posts from him that I quoted back in <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5833937#p5833937\" class=\"postlink\">post 17</a> seemed suspicious.</div></blockquote><br>Why do you feel the need to clarify being sarcastic? Why not run off with the sarcasm and try to provoke a reaction out of possible buddies of mine?</div></blockquote><br>As a player I'm not against making plays, but I always try to prioritize positive, clear communication between players foremost.  Even if they're scum, getting into fist fights over whether or not I was being sarcastic 9 pages ago just makes for incredibly unhealthy next-day gameplay.  I always want people to understand WHAT I'm saying.  Mafia should be about the WHY.  If we're running in circles about whether I'm lying about my original tone of voice, we most definitely are not going to be getting productive reads.  Secondarily because I don't care about reads on him as of now.  I wanted this discussion to be able to get a follow-up read on you after your interesting stream of posts.  It is most important, in my opinion to get reads on the most vocal members of the game, because those are the people who lead wagons.  As of now that's you and myself.<br>- - - - - -<br>Side note:  If anyone is morally against long posts I can shorten mine."}

It looks a bit aggressive, and generally speaking the scum that I have played with are careful concerning their D1 openings.  It just sounds too bold to be scum.  That being said, I haven't played with a single player in this game, so I'm not going to be able to make statements concerning their play style.  Doing techniques like quote dropping your own posts is a really easy way to have the town re-evaluate your statement, and I think it's something that confident town players pull very often.<br><br>2.  When you say backing off, I assume you're referring to when I said he was trying to \"unbuddy himself\" with a theoretical partner mnemonic.  I am referring to the String of posts 12-14, 16, and 18.  12 would be the theoretical \"mistake\" in that he ended up voting the same as his \"partner,\" then realized this, used the next two posts to distance himself from mnemonic, and pointedly criticizes Elyse's RVS post, and then backlashes against my post immediately afterwards.  The series of posts seemed like anxious scum play that was trying to be \"very town,\" and the post at me seemed just like a gut omgus out of fear that his mistake had been noticed.<br>This all being said, however, in Post 62, I clearly stated that I'm reading bjc fairly confidently as Town.<br><br>What I found interesting is that you said I was making a case, and tell me if I'm wrong, but I interpreted that as \"HTL making a case on bjc.\"  I am not pushing anything on bjc, based on our interactions I am confident enough to call him Town.  Are the straws that I am grasping at in reference to bjc, because I have no mind to push a wagon on him.  As of now, I want information out of kushmasta and geraintm.

I was with you until you said that, but it makes me question my read on you. :/ It seems like you going for that until people started calling you scum.</div></blockquote><br>1.)  The problem I had with him was that he seemed rash, especially since he immediately contradicted his previous vote.  It seemed like a \"whoops I would have edited out that vote if I could but that'd be cheating\" type of thing.  Imo, patient scum that get caught answer slowly and precisely.  Rash mafia players that get caught tend to be more defensive and emotionally charged (not even angry, but just focused on the absurdity of their accuser).  Since I was accusing bjc on the basis of being rash mafia, when his response was well structured and logical, it made me rethink.  His immediate response was to ask me questions about my accusation on him.  That is a very *not* defensive move, and mafioso who make rash errors tend to over-justify their actions.  His calm response definitely makes me think that either he quickly composed himself and is playing a solid game as mafia, or that his posts(12-14, etc.) in fact *were* consistent game play for him, and he just doesn't have many issues with quickly changing his opinions.  His quick responses to myself, as well as quips such as:<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5838412#p5838412\" class=\"postlink\">post 86</a>, bjc wrote:</cite>It's really inappropriate that you smoke weed.</div></blockquote><br>seem to lend to this explanation.  Hence, I'm seeing him as town.<br><br>2.)   I didn't change my opinion after getting flak-  my reversed opinion on bjc can be seen in Post 62 (Whip referring to the political role in Congress that gets people to participate).  I was essentially calling him town.  Between post 48 (My initial accusation) and 62 the only person to criticize me was bjc: calling a mafia team of mnemonic and myself, as well as saying he was curious as to why I wasn't voting him.   During this period of time I remained at 0 Votes.  Neither of those statement were really \"pressure.\"  The only pressure I got was from Slainte in Post 71, which was later.<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5838394#p5838394\" class=\"postlink\">post 85</a>, kushm4sta wrote:</cite>it's really inappropriate how  you have a curse word in your sig</div></blockquote><br>If it is a serious concern you could PM the mod and ask for bjc to hide his signature.  This isn't incredibly relevant to the discussions at hand, and with Slainte's contributions you're doing nothing more than active lurking."}

Arbitrarily saying that \"Policy Lynches are garbage\"  seems like absentminded firestarter.  Also his immediate reaction to me seemed overexcited.  It looks like a pseudo-calculated start.  The three posts in a row especially like he's trying to correct a mistake that he made, and generally speaking, as Town there's no reason to police your own opinions.  That being said I could just me misreading that fact that he was perhaps posting as he was reading the thread, as opposed to finishing the thread then posting comments.  I've done it before.</div></blockquote><br>Hmm...<br><br>1. What errors am I possibly trying to correct?<br>2. Do you believe policy-lynches are a <span style=\"font-style: italic\">good</span> thing? If so, why?<br>3. Was it really arbitrarily?</div></blockquote><br>1. To answer your question, let's live in the world of you being a paranoid scum player, temporarily.  As such, if it was an error, I think it would most likely be you trying to not buddy so obviously with mnemonicdevice as a scumpartner. Since your post came only a minute after mnemonic's, you would try your absolute best to distance yourself from your partner- especially on opening day randomwagons, and as such you immediately regretted your decision, quickly distanced yourself, and then tried to vote him to relieve stress on yourself.  The series of posts, especially with the follow-up to my initial Post 17 simply seemed like someone who was super eager and then realized that they did something really bad.<br><br>2. I think there are occasions where they are optimal.  In day-before lylo scenarios, I think lynching extreme lurkers (emphasis on extreme) is often necessary if you can't rely on them to improve by the next  in game day.  The occasions concerning which I get behind a policy lynch are far and few between.  That being said, I have no problem with the factual content of your post, but rather the reasons for your saying it.  Similar to topic 1.), I think the context of your post was interesting.  In such an early part of the game, generally speaking, first post comments are throw away or humorous, at least until further content is procured.  I'm fairly certain Elyse wasn't trying to actually push for a policy lynch. Your response seemed just very pointed for day 1 D1 town play.<br></div></blockquote><br><br>This post, less so:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5837291#p5837291\" class=\"postlink\">post 58</a>, geraintm wrote:</cite>I have nothing to add.

If it ends up that he has the same inconsistencies 4 more times in the game, then I'm definitely gonna look at it differently, but not now.<br><br>Yeah, Ger's been verbal about how he can't contribute day 1, but in doing so he has provided a certain amount of \"content.\"  I don't like what he's doing but at least he is communicating with the town.  Kushmasta on the other hand, is religiously dedicated to making posts that contain no more than 13 words of his own.  Ger is at least incredibly open.  I have no idea what to think of Kush, which only serves scum players.  Ger, I know how he talks, and I know how he thinks concerning D1.  I think either would be a fine lynch for the day, but I dont /want/ Kush in this game anymore, whereas I am fine with playing more with Ger.<br><br>I think Milked Eek continues to exclusively display town behavior.  I do not think Slainte is quite as scum as he thinks he is, but because of his play, I'd be fine lynching his targets.  Better to have town leading lynches than questionables.<br><br>At this point, I'd take a lynch on Kush, Ger, or Slainte, but I would be most reluctant to participate on the Ger lynch.<br>---<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5842289#p5842289\" class=\"postlink\">post 124</a>, SiX wrote:</cite>For a mafia I find Bjc too uncautious with his replies.

I'm reading Bjc the same way, although when he tries to be active as mafia he's usually far-slipping (Looking 'Ok' early, once partner is lynched he's caught) so in eitherway I'd prepare not to lynch him today for the people suspecting him.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Edit:</span> But it's also rather weird that you come to me of all people asking for my reads.

I think all discussion about those two is going to have to wait until D2 to be really all that productive.  It'd be far better to have talks about other people.  I have a question for everyone who think bjc is scum: <span class=\"noboldsig\"> Do you think that none of his behavior is evident of his play style as opposed to role?</span><br>---<br>I've played something like 8 games on this site, around 20-30 on other sites of this style.<br>--<br>Pour le bon homme, Monsieur bjc:<br>tl;dr you're town, so is milk, please stop arguing with Elyse, lets lynch ger, kush, or slainte."}

Each of the follow attributes when tied to a townie aid them in lynching mafia:  Appearing townie to other town, being able to lead town, being able to find mafia, being able to find town, being able to find power roles (but usually outing them is a terrible thing), being able to attract bullets as VT, good skills when Cop, etc.  Even if you're terrible at finding mafia, if you can show yourself as an incredibly obvious townie and lead the town well enough that they accept your lynches over less confirmed players, you're essentially removing influence of (possible) mafia players, even if you aren't actively hunting mafia that well.<br>I consider my better traits to be finding town and presenting myself as a townie, hence why I stressed my town reads at the beginning of the game, as well as my long posts. Mafia's a bit of a vanity game for me, I admit.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5851398#p5851398\" class=\"postlink\">post 257</a>, sthar8 wrote:</cite><!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cagey\">http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cagey</a><!-- m --><br><!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/obtuse?show=0&amp;t=1398570273\">http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictiona ... 1398570273</a><!-- m -->, 2b</div></blockquote><br>I understand what the words mean-  I'm asking in what scenarios would you describe me as cagey and/or obtuse.  If me asking these exact questions is what you're referring to, then I provide the counterpoint that I do so for a clear understanding of a person's projected intent.  As I discussed earlier, I don't want sarcasm or odd wording to get people tied up on misinterpretations.  A lot of times I already have answers to the questions I ask, and I want to see if our opinions match up.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5851398#p5851398\" class=\"postlink\">post 257</a>, sthar8 wrote:</cite>When I need your opinion, I'll ask.

Just for the sake of the situation, let's assume that ger and kush are the same alignment.  If we lynch Ger today, we have no means of actually talking about kush in a way that can inform us about whether we should lynch him or not.  However, if we lynch kush, tomorrow we still have Ger's rather large body of material, as well as what he will say on D2.  If the game keeps rolling as it is, I am relatively confident of the fact that Ger and Kush are going to eventually get lynched.  Generally speaking, for any Day X, Day X+1's lynch has a better chance of hitting mafia due to more posts, and a hopefully better informed town.  That being said, this only happens if the people who get thrown up for a lynch actually have material to discuss.  Kush has none.  As a tendency, D1 lynches are pretty non-accurate.  IMO, it is better to use the D1 lynch on Kush than to use it on Ger.  Ger, while still scummy, and more so actively lurking (That being said the torrent of responses he just made is kind of refreshing) compared to kush's passive lurking, can actually be analyzed and discussed.  A d@ wagon on Ger will be better informed than a D1 wagon on Ger, whereas a D2 wagon on Kush is NOT going to be better informed than a D1 wagon on him.<br>I know that Ger has been more insistent about digging his hole, but the dirt he's tossing out of the hole is at least stuff to be examined.  Kush is just kind of sitting on his shovel.<br>Also, post D1 lynches on lurkers turns into just the most horrendously WIFOM-based pissing arguments, and I really, really, really cannot stand arguments that rest on the ground of WIFOM.  Doubt is fine, but at a certain point, people who don't provide content shouldn't be in the game.<br>- - - - - -<br>Can we stop talking about our collective inabilities to make reads on D1?  SiX and Ger have been sitting on that same idea for so long, and both of them have thoroughly stated how the cant grab reads on D1.  Whether they're lying or not, you're not going to get anything else out of them on the subject.  It would be really great if we started talking about other stuff, like Ger's stream of conscious responses."}

All that does is make Town hesitant to kill you, and scum more likely to kill you, assuming you're town, which is a /terrible/ thing to do.  Town should never be scared to lynch any player.  They might be adverse to it due to good play from that person, but they should never feel intimidated out of doing it- which to me is exactly what this post is doing.<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5877278#p5877278\" class=\"postlink\">post 461</a>, My Milked Eek wrote:</cite>Never mind, I went back and iso'd you.

And no YOU cant be a useful player if you dont know the tone of each player's commentary, you don't know a list of actions done by each, etc., etc.  Mastery over a subject is being more efficient with the resources given to you- not having no need of the resources given to you because of your inherent skill.  Chessmasters are chessmasters because they can so economically utilize the information given to them by the current and previous states of the board.  Same with Mafia.  Same with DotA.<br>If you aren't willing to play the game then I would be absolutely terrified to see you still exist on a m/lylo.

Given Pim's power it's possible that something else happened, but I don't think its as probable.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5884575#p5884575\" class=\"postlink\">post 509</a>, HearTheLightning wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5872229#p5872229\" class=\"postlink\">post 433</a>, sthar8 wrote:</cite>Oh also I was positively reinforcing a good vig, so that he'll keep doing protown things in the future.<br><br>Or softclaiming my kill, YMMV.</div></blockquote><br>There is a 100% that this post does not help town.  \"Guys I was encouraging our PRs to keep being awesome... or maybe I am one!\"</div></blockquote> Slow down, tiger.

Relax.  Maybe have some champagne, whatever.

Secondly, my original point was that there's no reason to outride say you're softing a PR in the way that he did.  The usefulness of a soft is that it is subtle and can be referenced later.

If he gets replaced out and is a mafia role, we're completely screwed in that the new player essentially gets to start the game halfway into D2 with no criticisms against him.  Kush is incredibly useless to the game, and I frankly, would be terrified to put anyone at L1 this game with him still alive.  He doesn't seem quick to the hammer but then again I know nothing of him.  No one does.  We have a 9 player game in which there is a 10th vote which roles a D20 to decide where its vote goes.<br>At this point, I'd be fine with a sthar lynch, but to be honest I'm probably just reacting poorly to how he talks to people he disagrees with.  Ger is also still fine for me.  He's improved, but it's only making up lost time.  I don't think any of his material has reall contributed significantly to the Town."}

It seems like you were buddying him hard. Then you made posts 162 and 163. Vonflare is scum then no he's not. What?! This seems like scum just trying to WIFOM. In post 197 he says his scum play is bad. Again a super scummy thing to say. In 206 he's buddying us. Seems like he's trying to form an associative tell.

His #4 in that post does mention <span class=\"noboldsig\">bjc</span>, in that playing/posting style affecting people's reads too much, that if one doesn't like his posting style he must be Scum. I find that sentiment rather odd, considering his vote is still on me in spite of <span class=\"noboldsig\">MME</span> replacing out, and I only have 3 posts before this one. So how exactly that jives in spite of his current stance merits further elaboration. I don't post much because of having a busy life, but I do know analysis, and am strong in that element.<br><br>I also notice in that same post his first-pass read in his spoiler. Two people are leaning Scum there. Strangely, he says he's properly leaning Scum on one player, but that \"that's 2 more scum not posting enough.\" So, he has two people leaning Scum in his reads list, yet he suspects one player and has two other people who aren't posting enough he thinks are Scum. Which begs the question: Does <span class=\"noboldsig\">Wolfy</span> believe there are two or three Scum in this game? His reads list and his subsequent comment in that post don't mesh.<br><br>More reasoning for why <span class=\"noboldsig\">Wolfy</span> suspected <span class=\"noboldsig\">geraintm</span> would be helpful.

Probably scum, see earlier posts by Slandaar for confirmation or just read her posts.<br>Slaint - As D2 went on I became more and more concerned with their play. No I'm not OMGUS'ing because my suspicion of them came longer before they attacked me. Their attack of me was very forced, very contrived and rather weak. I won't spend a lot of time on them here, but they are (or should be) in the lynch pile.<br>Sthar - Want to see more from him, I kind of liked his play D1<br>Ger - Worst of all players still alive in multiple ways. First, remember all that content and ability he promised would come D2? Yeah, where is that? Second, he makes absolutely no sense and keeps trying to justify the PL angle. He's probably the safest candidate.<br>Wake/MME - my reread has me concerned of this slot.

She ended up being a JK, but I digress...<br><br>I'm just afraid she could be playing differently due to lack of interest, having a VT role, being scum etc. Hell, I myself am not overly active in this game and it took me half a week to do what I kept promising I'd do. So at this point, I feel like we're going to fall into the trap of doing a crapshoot lynch like yesterday. That means guys like ger and kush are the targets, and kush seems to be the one most are trying to crumb/go after. It just sets alarms off in my head because it's too easy, and it's too similar to a PL for my liking. That's actually one of the only reasons I'm worried about HtL in the first place: he keeps trying to push the PL angle, as does Ger. <br><br>tl;dr I think we should lynch SM or Ger after interacting with you. <span class=\"noboldsig\">vote: Slainte Mhath</span>"}

I didn't mention why because I felt like it was a terrible read, and it was.  I have long since abandoned it.<br><br>Also I am feeling more like sthar is probably town-  mostly from his conversations about the non-mafia aspects (college age, etc., ironically).  I didn't expect him to be quite so incredibly dismissive of everything in his sight.  I still don't like much of his material at all-  since he suddenly thinks that I'm the anti-christ after I said that I thought some of the things he said were stupid- but I do think that it's not from scum.  He's not running a very productive tunnel atm.<br><br>And to be honest, to continue on it, no I don't think that lynching kush is going to be good for the game, but having him alive in Lylo is absolutely not allowed.  Under any circumstance.  And if we don't lynch him now, when are we ever going to lynch him?  Do you really want someone who wont even read the game choosing between the final townie and mafia member in a 3-man Lylo?  He's obviously not gonna get NK'd, as scum as no reason to get rid of him, and if he's scum, then he's not gonna vote himself.  Sthar can say as much as he wants that cutting your losses is a terrible strategy, but Kush is someone I really, really don't want to deal with on a D3 o D4... we have /no material/ on him.<br><br>That being said, I feel like the sudden increase on Kush's wagon is super scum-opportunistic.  It's less than 24 hours to end of day, and scum want an easy miss.  If the Kush lynch goes through, then I would DEFINITELY look at the people on this wagon.<br><br>Yet again, if we are at L-1 and need a lynch I will be fine to switch my vote around.  And sorry again for the completely abominable day.  I've been so exhausted over the past few weeks, so my content has been pathetic."}

It is to do with scum needing to be x% more proactive than the highest townie and the higher the % gets the harder it is because the bigger the gap the more and more from scums POV is that their work is 'done' so their will to post drops the other factor which can play is being too proactive and not being nked brings questions thus discouraging them from posting. There is literally only one player I can think of who actually breaks this mold.

It is to do with scum needing to be x% more proactive than the highest townie and the higher the % gets the harder it is because the bigger the gap the more and more from scums POV is that their work is 'done' so their will to post drops the other factor which can play is being too proactive and not being nked brings questions thus discouraging them from posting.

Ger has been criticized over and over again concerning the same points.  If he were to get lynched, the case against him would essentially be \"I think he did [content we already discussed on D1 and D2 in excruciating detail]\"  whereas a lynch on me would require NEW content that has yet to be discussed, which could possibly help town into figuring how who is mafia/who is town based on how the wagon on me turns out.  I'm not a hypocrite-  wagons produce content for town to use in finding scum, and wagons on me are not exempt from this.<br>To expand on this-  each Day, to simplify, has two goals.<br>1.  To find and lynch scum for that day.<br>2.  To create content to be analyzed the NEXT day so as to fulfill goal #1 for the next day.<br> The only day where goal 2 is irrelevant is in a lylo situation where there's 1 mafia left.  From a non-me/Ger perspective, we both might be scum, but a wagon on him doesn't make any content to be discussed for the next day (\"Hey I think what you said about Ger was very over-eager, you might be scum!\"), because it's all been said.  A wagon on me would bring out new evidence, new suspicions, etc., which are all REALLY healthy for a town that is clearly running severely low on gas.<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5921924#p5921924\" class=\"postlink\">post 785</a>, Elyse wrote:</cite>@HTL<br>Your post hit a lot of red flags, such as the inability to understand why someone would want to lynch you and threatening bjc by asking if he's secure with certain players finding scum.</div></blockquote>\"I would strongly suggest against shooting me, though I can understand why you'd want to.\"  I completely understand why people would want to lynch me-  I think you are misconstruing what I said.  And secondly, I apologize if it came off as passive aggressive- I am literally asking him \"Please double check to ensure that you are okay with a Town of {Slandaar, Sthar8, My Milked Elk, and Elyse} being able to find scum if the game doesn't end N3?\"  That's it.  He's most likely going to be NK'd, so I am simply providing that as food for thought. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5921924#p5921924\" class=\"postlink\">post 785</a>, Elyse wrote:</cite>You wanting to be lynched and have Ger shot is weird and makes no sense. I think you are trying to use reverse psychology to keep yourself from being lynched. Maybe you have some role that can block bjc's kill or something.</div></blockquote><br>If you're paranoid about my intentions I'm going to have no way to convince you otherwise.  I am not trying to save myself from being lynched, I am trying to better the town for the condition that the game does not end by N3.  For the other half of your statement-  are you really considering that both myself and Ger are scum?  First off-  check the list of standard roles, which one allows me to save Ger from a NK after I've been lynched?  Secondarily if I'm scum there'd be no reason to protect him if he's town, and if he was scum and I was town, I really wouldn't want to protect him, cause I think there's an above average chance of hitting properly on him.  This is a really unfounded paranoia, even if I am scum.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5921924#p5921924\" class=\"postlink\">post 785</a>, Elyse wrote:</cite>Then you say you are \"80% sure\" scum is within four players, only ruling out yourself, bjc, and sthar which literally means nothing.<br><br>I don't understand why a wagon on MME or Ger wouldn't be productive. If it's because it's hard to produce a case on them because of lack of content, isn't that reason enough?</div></blockquote><br>I apologize for my wording-  I suppose it would have been better to have said \"There is an above average chance of hitting scum within this pool of players than there is in the remaining pool of players.\"  I just hate giving out objective statements about how there's a \"100% that there's scum between these people.\"<br><br>And next, yet again, it is not that there's no content to be made concerning Ger, it's that there's next to no NEW content (Not from him, but about him)  he's said a lot, but the only things people hate about him are his D1 and D2 play, so any wagon on him would just be beating a dead horse-  as such a NK on him would be better since it doesn't waste important discussion time within the town.  As for MME, it's not that he has no content, it's that the content is in a very weird situation given that there have been two replacements on that specific slot-  despite one being the original.  He has had a huge interim and can kind of be excused for lack of content after getting back into the game.  A wagon on him would be kinda spotty, and I still maintain my town read on the role regardless, so I feel that a wagon would be wasted there.<br>---<br>I believe that's covered everything."}

I doesn't promote lurking it promotes shooting lurkers at night.  He dies either way, it's really simple.  \"Promotes lurking\" is an absurd thing to be said about me when literally for the first 2 Days my primary lynch was a lurker who had been producing little to no content.<br><br>It is not \"lynch active players who have content.\"  We have choice A and choice B.  Choice A and Choice B are both going to die.  Choice A has been talked about and re-discussed time and time again.  Choice B has not.  We have two tools of execution, both of with will be used, each on one of Choice A and B.  The first execution tool requires town collaboration and effort/wagoning.  This tool requires discussion and dedication as a whole to be able to commit behind.  As such, it should always be used in a way such that the discussed material helps bring more \"knowledge to the table\" so-to-speak.  Since Choice A has been talked about a ton it is better to use this tool to focus on Choice B.  Talking about Choice B allows the town to gain new perspectives on how outed scum interacted with Choice B, how outed town interacted with Choice B, etc.  Attention being brought to these details can possibly help town in locating scum.  None of these benefits happen if this execution tool is used on Choice A, since it has *already been discussed.*  Luckily, the second execution tool requires no collaboration, and since Choice A has already been discussed in detail, the secondary execution tool can be used to simply remove them from the map of the game.  This is the most efficient way of killing both Choice A and Choice B given the two execution tools provided.<br><br><br>\"Lynch players with content\" is not the cause for my reference, it is a coincidental happenstance.  What I am saying is \"Lynch the person who has been discussed less.\"  If I was the lurker and he was the one heavy with content (Which is kind of true, to be honest-  at this point Ger has talked about way more things than I have), I would still prefer it this way.  NK people that the town can't decide on/have been discussed a ton yet someone avoided lynches, and use the actual lynch on people who are still considered scummy but haven't been talked about.  Lynches/wagons are tools not only to kill people but to also bring attention to facts, details, etc., that can be used for future lynches."}

Any reason I should believe you?</div></blockquote><br>I don't drop crumbs.  It's incredibly easy for a scum player to posture themselves in expectation of claiming as one or even several roles, and hiding \"hints\" in numerous posts- they prove next to nothing.  I find that upon review of my posts that I should be found to be a player who played very much so a \"control\" game where I was more preoccupied with appearing midrange-ish as a not super-town, but not incredibly scummy.  Unfortunately, the only gameplay that I can link my behavior to is the Slainte check N1.  The fact that upon the later days of D1, I began including SM in my lynchable selection should in itself provide a small amount of verification.  My reasoning was that he seemed to be playing like either a mafia role blocker or doctor.  In my opinion a lot of his analysis looked slightly PR oriented.  I was, however, wrong, and having found him vanilla, I found it easier to believe him to be vanilla town than vanilla scum.  That's also why I dropped my suspicion of him D2.<br><br>Otherwise, I find myself to have played a relatively decent game.  I was incredibly lazy D2 and D3, but I think I have ample excuse for it, which is neither her nor there in terms of relevance to this specific game.  That being said, I'm also vaguely martyring myself because I have at most one more check, and it runs vanilla on goons, so I don't even consider myself much of a \"PR\" at this point."}

Every town power role had highly varying potentials in how useful they'd be; I really wanted them to pay dividends for people who made smart choices with them.  I also wanted to try not to be totally cookie cutter in my allocations.<br><br>I liked the idea of the Weak Neighbouriser as it gave its recipient a choice between whether to try and find scum to suicide on, to verify a strong townie to work with, or perhaps shades of the two.  Pim never sent in an action, so that role went nowhere.  Perhaps another time.<br><br>The Odd-Night Role Cop was useful within the confines of this setup, but probably wouldn't be seen as a generally useful PR at all.  I thought out of the town power roles that would be the one to get heat, and it had the potential to be an almost useless role.  However, having the mafia power roles split meant there was more chance of him finding something useful to push on, particularly if it'd got to use its N3 shot and scum were ahead.  <br><br>Vigilante can be fairly anti-town; in this case it was used fairly sensibly, but things could have gone a different way.  It puts a lot of power in one person's hands!  I mainly included this one for the fun factor and to keep mafia on their toes.<br><br>Mafia-wise, the power roles were split so as to not centralise them in one spot, and to add ciphers for the Role Cop to find.  The Tracker was only truly reliable at clearing Vig prospects, and the RB was also only reliably useful for locking down the Vig -- if the situation called for it, of course.  Whilst neither PR would be auto-guilty to the Role Cop if scanned, I felt it should make them see them as more likely guilty than not if they'd thought about things a little.  <br><br>I'm happy enough with it for my first outing, I think!  Thanks for playing.  I may venture a themed game next time... we'll see."}
