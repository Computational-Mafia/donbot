It just makes the thread a bit more readable, esspecially with rereads.<br>\nSecond: I might be a bit busy and rather rushed, but that second alinea already starts to take the block of text form that makes it rather hard to work through. Since this is the start of the game and you are a townsperson after all, let me put a bit of work in and analyse this stuff.<br>\n<br>\nFirst sentence, nice use of a rhetorical question, makes me want to read on. For a bit. Like the quotation marks, clearly give away what you mean there. Second sentence is a great core. <br>\n<br>\nThen we get a horrible line full of comma's that actually argues your point you gave in the first sentence but doesn't add anything of value. Shorten it or cut it, this only makes people not want to read what you are writing.<br>\n<br>\nFourth is more of the same, won't convince anyone because it's in the middle of a huge block of text, doesn't add anything new. \"from my perspective\" isn't a good thing to use here cause it weakens the weak thing you said already. It makes the argumentative value of the sentence even lower as the first thing another person will think is: \"well, that's your perspective, why should that be mine as well?\"<br>\n<br>\nI like how you tell what tells you are going to look for (overacting), I agree with it. Fine. Could have used a new alinea, since the next sentence (where you argue deadjoker is indeed doing this) brings a new piece of evidence. It's connection with the \"information\" is a bit loose. New subject? new alinea.<br>\n<br>\nLast questions are in principle good, rhetorical in use again because you imply deathjoker won't have the answer. At least, I think he won't. You could again have made this more readable by placing each on a new line, new alinea, since they are the conclusion to your case:<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Can you explain why you kept your interpretations of the mini-wagon to yourself? <br>\nAnd can you explain what \"information to work with\" you were referring to?</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nAll in all, I like what you are saying, it's as good a case as you can bring on page one. But please try to make it easy to read by everybody. Nobody likes blocks of text.<br>\n<br>\nAnd a bit of a tip from an experienced player: people are more likely to read your case if you end it with a vote.

Sounds like you just made the decision that you'd have a townread on FT and weren't interested in developing your read any further. Scummy.<br>\n3.

Why does my read have to change? His play has been consistent to vote-shy newbie. Also side note, I never said I have a townread on FT. I have a neutral-read. I have a townread on three people, but saying who they are only helps scum.<br>\n3) I think you're voting FT by stretching your early case, considering your vote was on post #34. His reactions were nothing out of the ordinary for a new player, either town or scum. I still think it's a lazy and uninspired wagon. <br>\n<br>\nBut while you're reading, may I resuggest looking at the peabody wagon?

You think that was a town post O_o</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nTown post is a bit the wrong way to say it. In general I'm not the best at reading gregory. It becomes a lot easier when he reacts to stuff I do. And knowing that he's generally the better scumhunter of us two, it's rather valuable to find out his allignment early. So you throw up stuff that he can't ignore, in either sense. Either because he thinks he should explain something I did or, because something is outside my normal way of doing. The problem is that this will likely be the last time I do this now, now that he knows what I'm doing <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\"><br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4332145#p4332145\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4332145#p4332145\" data-post-id=\"4332145\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 166</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10875\">image</a> wrote:</cite><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">@mykonian:</div> Maybe I'm missing something.

Nobody, regardless of allignment, is going to claim straight away. Scum is going to check if there has been a fakeclaim before, town doesn't like the idea of claiming anyway. Everybody is going to read. And then they'll say I'm an ass for asking because there's no reason to claim. The way in how they respond might give something. How passive they are, do they use it as a reason to vote straight away, etc. And if I was wrong and he did claim, it wouldn't be that bad since he was one of the more suspected players early.

You have not said anywhere why you think things, just that you do. Your votes look arbitrary and it's why it's making you stand out to me. The closest thing to a visible thinking process from you is you seeing Gregory vote for snifit, and jumping off because of it without laying the vote back down.

We'd never do this as a whole and DJ knows this. Moving on.<br>\n<br>\nAs of Post #195 (ISO #8): DJ votes Shadoweh who is a member of {Dudes<sup>c</sup>}, but says he'd hammer sniffit or Coron. Apparantly 4 posts later at #199 Gregory has become a good target too and he does a wagon hop with little reasoning<br>\n<br>\nPost #218: Now without reason you are confident enough to call for Greg's hammer!

I don't agree with it, but it's a town POV. You replace in and, in reading, see that I put a great deal of pressure on your slot early in the day. Pressure which I freely admit was out of proportion with the available information at that time. Your thought process, which was clear from your <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4348150#p4348150\">#286</a> was that someone pushing unfairly on someone you know is town is probably scum.<br>\nWhy don't I agree with your mentality? Well, look at the people voting for me--among them you, Gregory, FaerieLord. All people I've pressured today. Is it coincidence that you all suspect me after I've pressured you? Yeah, probably. Do the pseudo-OMGUS reactions help me find scum? No, not really.<br>\nAs for why you might miss context when reading the thread all at once: you see the posts coming one after the other, and unless you're specifically checking you won't see how many days it took for those posts to appear. I experience the game in realtime, whereas you experience it as fast as you can read it. I don't think, given the context, it was a baffling vote.<br>\n<br>\nVoting someone doesn't mean I think they're the scummiest at that point in time. Votes are tools. deadjoker didn't \"leapfrog\" any of my suspects to earn my vote--I was adding weight to my question. Of course, the closer we get to deadline the more important it is to use your vote as a \"I want to lynch this person\" indicator, which is why my vote didn't stay on deadjoker for long.

There was a lot of momentum behind the Gregory wagon.  By putting him at L-1 and calling for a hammer, I was hoping to catch an overzealous scum that could be 1v1'd.  That, and I wanted to see if anyone else would be cheering from the sidelines calling for a lynch, and watching those who jumped off the wagon as soon as it looked like Gregory was going to get hammered.  NOT really that difficult to understand.<br>\n<br>\nAnd no, I don't suspect half the field.  I'm trying to make scum teams.

Basically, I think his post shows a lack of thought going into whether Four's actions are actually scummy or not.<br>\n<br>\n-My biggest point (and what really started my scumread) is in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4319843#p4319843\">38</a> where his reaction to Snifit calling him obvtown is, \"What the heck?

This is because when you are actually town that has posted a bit, and then someone calls you obvtown, you would think that maybe (because you are town) you did something that you wouldn't have done as scum, right? Maybe you'd be wondering why that person thought you were obvtown (in order to better read them), but disbelief/shock as is displayed by Peabody is not something I would expect.<br>\n<br>\n-Also, I agree with what other people were saying about Peabody not really focusing on scumhunting, and am also surprised that he didn't push Four more than he did. He just latched on for one thing (which is not something I think could be considered conclusively scummy), and there were a fair few other posted made by Four, but Pea didn't seem to consider them.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF4000\">Charter Scumread:</div><br>\n<br>\nThis is mainly just bad votes and bad reasoning I think.<br>\n<br>\n-His vote on Fireflies in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4327426#p4327426\">139</a>.<br>\n-No attempt to really push OBF before joining the gregory wagon. \"if no one is interested in OBF, then...\"<br>\n-<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4341846#p4341846\">244</a>.

Everybody can make them. It would be an outrageous play. And that's out of character.<br>\n<br>\nIt's similar to contradiction arguments you hear a lot. Someone points out a \"contradiction\" and then calls the maker scum for being inconsistent. Sure, they happen. But more often it's simply a misunderstanding. Now, if you have a bit of meta how likely the person making the \"contradiction\" is actually to do that, you have a good estimation how often you'll be wrong \"catching\" someone with that. <br>\n<br>\nIn this case, snifit catches FL with something that if true, would be very obviously wrong. He could know he's misunderstanding FL (as is shown in the next posts between them, it's people talking side by side) if he knew FL isn't likely to make such plays anyway. You can catch FL, but you'd have to do that by analysing his playstyle, how much he lurks, what he avoids, how much of the words he types actually don't say a thing.<br>\n<br>\nIn short, he is indeed being dumb. Everybody makes silly arguments sometimes. Happens. In a way you throw out stuff you think off and see what actually makes sense, that's discussion. But he's being stubborn about an idea which doesn't work, isn't going to get us anywhere, because apart from charter I don't think anybody is interested in FL. And as FL remarks, charter's interest is a bit to be expected. <br>\n<br>\nSo yeah, sue me for trying to get a confirmed townie to actually be productive.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>shadoweh wrote:</cite>Oh sir mykonian I hath heard rumors forewhence that thou might be aligned with yonder rapscallions!

I didn't say you would be scared away, I said you weren't really at your place. Scumchat is filled with people who have in general different interests from yours, I thought. Think. Different age too, if I'm not mistaken. It just makes you stand out, that's all. <br>\n<br>\nBehind this logical shell is something that tries to scumhunt on feelings as well, shadoweh. I'm well past the point where I believe just logic will get me anywhere. I'm aware of a couple of others here who try to do the same. I'm also well aware that posting a lot gets you lynched. I get mislynched or for that matter lynched enough to know how it happens. When it happens, what I do. And sure, lurking helps. <br>\n<br>\nIt makes it a little surprising that the rest of the players is able to throw out reads to discuss while you leave literally nothing that can be discussed, have only a couple of real reads out after two days and are quite constantly parking your vote well away from the rest of us.

Popcorn has become a standard, but popcorn is a bit of a poor man's choice. You want the towniest to come last in claiming, the scummiest first so counterclaims can be set up etc. Popcorn basically comes into play when nobody agrees on who should go first and who last. Might be something to talk about. For example, I think it could be a nice idea to claim from least posts to most (which very conveniently places me last <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\"> ) esspecially as some people showed a correlation between posting frequency and allignment (ie. scum lurk, was shown for some games, a long time ago). We could claim based on last days last votecount, from most votes to least. That gives rather an impression who's scummiest and who's towniest.

In effect you are asking the confirmed townie for direction. Now, as said before I don't exactly know why it works.

And we have two days of unsuccesful discussion which still give some information. <br>\n<br>\nThat and I'm a bit curious.<br>\n<br>\nFurther, it might be nice to discuss how to do it. Popcorn has become a standard, but popcorn is a bit of a poor man's choice. You want the towniest to come last in claiming, the scummiest first so counterclaims can be set up etc. Popcorn basically comes into play when nobody agrees on who should go first and who last. Might be something to talk about. For example, I think it could be a nice idea to claim from least posts to most (which very conveniently places me last <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\"> ) esspecially as some people showed a correlation between posting frequency and allignment (ie. scum lurk, was shown for some games, a long time ago). We could claim based on last days last votecount, from most votes to least. That gives rather an impression who's scummiest and who's towniest. Or just popcorn, if you hate discussion.</div></blockquote><br>\nThere's no way in hell that scum myko would decide to take the angle of \"let's change the site meta for massclaim\" as opposed to \"let's just do popcorn\".
