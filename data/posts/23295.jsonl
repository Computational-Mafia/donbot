You say it has given us \"information\" to work with, but you don't actually offer any suggestions or serious analysis. It's like you were about to offer a potential lead, and then suddenly decided to keep your thoughts to yourself, as if your thoughts didn't have any value. I'll be honest, from my perspective, I get the feeling you are worried your interpretations of the mini-wagon will be construed as scummy. Townies usually don't worry about APPEARING scummy, whereas one of the biggest scum-tells is people putting too much effort into appearing pro-town. This seems like a case where you attempt to appear pro-town (suggesting we have information to work with), while at the same time taking no positions, and offering no real leads or information. Maybe you can explain why you kept your interpretations of the mini-wagon to yourself? Or explain what \"information to work with\" you were referring to?"}

You say it has given us \"information\" to work with, but you don't actually offer any suggestions or serious analysis. It's like you were about to offer a potential lead, and then suddenly decided to keep your thoughts to yourself, as if your thoughts didn't have any value. I'll be honest, from my perspective, I get the feeling you are worried your interpretations of the mini-wagon will be construed as scummy. Townies usually don't worry about APPEARING scummy, whereas one of the biggest scum-tells is people putting too much effort into appearing pro-town. This seems like a case where you attempt to appear pro-town (suggesting we have information to work with), while at the same time taking no positions, and offering no real leads or information. Maybe you can explain why you kept your interpretations of the mini-wagon to yourself? Or explain what \"information to work with\" you were referring to?</div></blockquote><br><br>ok, two things. One, please get an avatar, helps everybody a lot to know people from each other. It just makes the thread a bit more readable, esspecially with rereads.<br>Second: I might be a bit busy and rather rushed, but that second alinea already starts to take the block of text form that makes it rather hard to work through. Since this is the start of the game and you are a townsperson after all, let me put a bit of work in and analyse this stuff.<br><br>First sentence, nice use of a rhetorical question, makes me want to read on. For a bit. Like the quotation marks, clearly give away what you mean there. Second sentence is a great core. <br><br>Then we get a horrible line full of comma's that actually argues your point you gave in the first sentence but doesn't add anything of value. Shorten it or cut it, this only makes people not want to read what you are writing.<br><br>Fourth is more of the same, won't convince anyone because it's in the middle of a huge block of text, doesn't add anything new. \"from my perspective\" isn't a good thing to use here cause it weakens the weak thing you said already. It makes the argumentative value of the sentence even lower as the first thing another person will think is: \"well, that's your perspective, why should that be mine as well?\"<br><br>I like how you tell what tells you are going to look for (overacting), I agree with it. Fine. Could have used a new alinea, since the next sentence (where you argue deadjoker is indeed doing this) brings a new piece of evidence. It's connection with the \"information\" is a bit loose. New subject? new alinea.<br><br>Last questions are in principle good, rhetorical in use again because you imply deathjoker won't have the answer. At least, I think he won't. You could again have made this more readable by placing each on a new line, new alinea, since they are the conclusion to your case:<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Can you explain why you kept your interpretations of the mini-wagon to yourself? <br>And can you explain what \"information to work with\" you were referring to?</div></blockquote><br><br>All in all, I like what you are saying, it's as good a case as you can bring on page one. But please try to make it easy to read by everybody. Nobody likes blocks of text.<br><br>And a bit of a tip from an experienced player: people are more likely to read your case if you end it with a vote. On page one, the above would clearly have been enough for a deadjoker vote:<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">vote deadjoker</span>"}

Random voting is great cause it leaves footprints. Let's say we lynched you at this very moment and you turned out to be scum, without a vote, we can only stipulate from your posts.

By withholding a random vote, you're essentially denying town a minuscule amount of information, yet it is still information none the less.

So if I am understanding this right, \"Shadoweh who is not a dude\", when I want to call out lurkers I'm scum, but when you do it it is okay?

OBF's unvote and switch to a wagon that has a lot more momentum was pure awfulness.  The only thing I have to figure out is why would a scum bus another scum so early on in the game when Peabody isn't anywhere close to being lynched yet?  Spooked scum? Peabody is actually town? OBF is getting buddied by \"Shadoweh who is not a dude\"?<br><br>Based off the fact that \"Shadoweh who is not a dude\" is chainsawing hard and trying to engage everyone on Peabody's bandwagon, I'm content with my vote.

You think that was a town post O_o</div></blockquote><br><br>Town post is a bit the wrong way to say it. In general I'm not the best at reading gregory. It becomes a lot easier when he reacts to stuff I do. And knowing that he's generally the better scumhunter of us two, it's rather valuable to find out his allignment early. So you throw up stuff that he can't ignore, in either sense. Either because he thinks he should explain something I did or, because something is outside my normal way of doing.

Nobody, regardless of allignment, is going to claim straight away. Scum is going to check if there has been a fakeclaim before, town doesn't like the idea of claiming anyway. Everybody is going to read. And then they'll say I'm an ass for asking because there's no reason to claim. The way in how they respond might give something. How passive they are, do they use it as a reason to vote straight away, etc. And if I was wrong and he did claim, it wouldn't be that bad since he was one of the more suspected players early. And he'd probably be scum then anyway.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4333126#p4333126\" class=\"postlink\">post 171</a>, Gregory wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4332116#p4332116\" class=\"postlink\">post 165</a>, snifit wrote:</cite>How would you say mykonian's play is deviating from his townmeta?

I don't agree with it, but it's a town POV. You replace in and, in reading, see that I put a great deal of pressure on your slot early in the day. Pressure which I freely admit was out of proportion with the available information at that time. Your thought process, which was clear from your <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4348150#p4348150\">#286</a> was that someone pushing unfairly on someone you know is town is probably scum.<br>Why don't I agree with your mentality? Well, look at the people voting for me--among them you, Gregory, FaerieLord. All people I've pressured today. Is it coincidence that you all suspect me after I've pressured you? Yeah, probably. Do the pseudo-OMGUS reactions help me find scum? No, not really.<br>As for why you might miss context when reading the thread all at once: you see the posts coming one after the other, and unless you're specifically checking you won't see how many days it took for those posts to appear. I experience the game in realtime, whereas you experience it as fast as you can read it. I don't think, given the context, it was a baffling vote.<br><br>Voting someone doesn't mean I think they're the scummiest at that point in time. Votes are tools. deadjoker didn't \"leapfrog\" any of my suspects to earn my vote--I was adding weight to my question. Of course, the closer we get to deadline the more important it is to use your vote as a \"I want to lynch this person\" indicator, which is why my vote didn't stay on deadjoker for long.

Good lord. Is having a strong but wrong read pro- or anti-town?<br>Yes, I'd say my reads are weak today. I'd also say that my reads have evolved as the day has gone on.

I get attacked for these things?<br>Saying, \"I would be willing to lynch w, x, y, and z\" is not \"putting suspicion\" on w, x, y, and z, and you're strange for suggesting that it is.

I was the second vote on Gregory (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4325789#p4325789\">#128</a>). OBF? Guilty as charged, I guess.

I hardly think you can describe my vote pattern as \"wagon hopping\".<br><br>Your suggestion that my willingness to lynch 4 people is indicative of scum is...well, it's ridiculous. (Leaving aside the very real possibility that there are 4 scum in the game--it's not about that).<br>\"Lynching for associations\" is a strange way to go about lynching on Day 1. You say you suspect charter, and I'm a plausible scumpartner for charter, so you're pushing for my lynch. You get my flip, do you stop suspecting charter? No, you're still going to want to lynch him. You're lying to yourself.<br><br>___<br><br>Final note, but deadjoker and OBF are lurking out the rest of the day and no one seems to care."}

There was a lot of momentum behind the Gregory wagon.  By putting him at L-1 and calling for a hammer, I was hoping to catch an overzealous scum that could be 1v1'd.

NOT really that difficult to understand.<br><br>And no, I don't suspect half the field.  I'm trying to make scum teams.  OBF and Herr make sense, but Herr and you don't make sense as long as I assume that scum don't back to back on the same target.

This is because when you are actually town that has posted a bit, and then someone calls you obvtown, you would think that maybe (because you are town) you did something that you wouldn't have done as scum, right? Maybe you'd be wondering why that person thought you were obvtown (in order to better read them), but disbelief/shock as is displayed by Peabody is not something I would expect.<br><br>-Also, I agree with what other people were saying about Peabody not really focusing on scumhunting, and am also surprised that he didn't push Four more than he did.

Do you really believe we might be scum together? If yes, lol what?! If no, you're pushing a town lynch. Make up your mind.</div></blockquote><br>Yes, it was clearly just rhetoric. The reason it stood out is that your read on me came out of nowhere. You say it was \"an obvious process of elimination.\" Can you explain how you PoE'd the 10 people it would take to find 2 scum on Day 1?<br>As for charter and I voting together: worthless and lazy analysis. I was on a couple of wagons with image and Coron, and often voted with Rudi. charter was on a couple of wagons with image.<br>Setting that aside, your contention seems to be that scum tend to vote together. In my experience, when scum vote together it is often an attempt to thwart later VCAs; was your accusation here a third-level WIFOM or something?<br>Your suspicion of me didn't make sense on any level.<br><br>As to your last paragraph: \"lol what?!\" indeed. I expect you both to flip scum. Problem?<br><br>Folks, FaerieLord's read on me came out of nowhere and his slide on to my wagon was opportunistic. I know people tend to not have scumreads on people who make bigger posts, as FaerieLord did a few times early in Day1, but they were just fluff. Lynch him.</div></blockquote><br><br>You just said you expect us to flip scum. By this game-size, probably together. I can't take your read seriously anymore sorry. Why the hell would I chainsaw attack a scumpartner for no reason, when he was under no pressure whatsoever?<br><br>Also, the difference between you, image, coron and rudi was this. I've said before that I have a town read on coron. Rudi was so obviously town that he was NKed yesterday. And that leaves image. You're right, I overlooked image. Maybe he's charter's partner. Also, what \"scum vote together to thwart later VCAs\". So...scum vote together? We agree? <br><br>Also, saying people don't find me scummy because I make \"large posts\" is 1) Hilarious, cause my posts are relatively short 2) one of the worst strawmen I've ever seen"}

Everybody can make them. It would be an outrageous play. And that's out of character.<br><br>It's similar to contradiction arguments you hear a lot. Someone points out a \"contradiction\" and then calls the maker scum for being inconsistent. Sure, they happen. But more often it's simply a misunderstanding. Now, if you have a bit of meta how likely the person making the \"contradiction\" is actually to do that, you have a good estimation how often you'll be wrong \"catching\" someone with that. <br><br>In this case, snifit catches FL with something that if true, would be very obviously wrong. He could know he's misunderstanding FL (as is shown in the next posts between them, it's people talking side by side) if he knew FL isn't likely to make such plays anyway. You can catch FL, but you'd have to do that by analysing his playstyle, how much he lurks, what he avoids, how much of the words he types actually don't say a thing.<br><br>In short, he is indeed being dumb. Everybody makes silly arguments sometimes. Happens. In a way you throw out stuff you think off and see what actually makes sense, that's discussion. But he's being stubborn about an idea which doesn't work, isn't going to get us anywhere, because apart from charter I don't think anybody is interested in FL. And as FL remarks, charter's interest is a bit to be expected. <br><br>So yeah, sue me for trying to get a confirmed townie to actually be productive.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>shadoweh wrote:</cite>Oh sir mykonian I hath heard rumors forewhence that thou might be aligned with yonder rapscallions!

If I were scared away by things like 'too high testosterone' I would never make it through a game of mafia &lt;.&lt; My style that you haven't caught onto is pure emotional. I post based on what I'm feeling at the time towards someone. I don't have feelings on a bunch of people which is kind of the problem.

I think Coron ran out of :effort: and flaked out, which is a 100% scum trait because townies don't get bored so easily, but now everyone is voting charter and Gregory for I Ddo Not Even Fucking Know. Did you people know that lurking is the #1 most effective scum ability because townies have an attraction to shiny posts full of 'things we can legitimately attack'? I think you all just stop voting people if they don't talk enough. I'm kind of disgusted to realize that as long as I don't post as whole bunch at some point it will take days for someone to work up the will to lynch me, not because of anything I say, but because you will literally not vote me because there 'isn't enough there to attack' in your minds.<br><br>I do legitimately think DV is town at least. I don't have any feelings about either of the lead wagons. People keep talking about a CDB wagon and with his lurking and inactivity I can see why, but wouldn't you know it, I don't think he's ever had a wagon with reel votes on it! Can't imagine why! It's almost like you attention spaz's aren't being annoyed enough by his delightful non-presence!"}

I didn't say you would be scared away, I said you weren't really at your place. Scumchat is filled with people who have in general different interests from yours, I thought. Think.

I'm well past the point where I believe just logic will get me anywhere. I'm aware of a couple of others here who try to do the same. I'm also well aware that posting a lot gets you lynched. I get mislynched or for that matter lynched enough to know how it happens. When it happens, what I do. And sure, lurking helps. <br><br>It makes it a little surprising that the rest of the players is able to throw out reads to discuss while you leave literally nothing that can be discussed, have only a couple of real reads out after two days and are quite constantly parking your vote well away from the rest of us.

Popcorn has become a standard, but popcorn is a bit of a poor man's choice. You want the towniest to come last in claiming, the scummiest first so counterclaims can be set up etc. Popcorn basically comes into play when nobody agrees on who should go first and who last. Might be something to talk about. For example, I think it could be a nice idea to claim from least posts to most (which very conveniently places me last <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\"> ) esspecially as some people showed a correlation between posting frequency and allignment (ie. scum lurk, was shown for some games, a long time ago). We could claim based on last days last votecount, from most votes to least. That gives rather an impression who's scummiest and who's towniest. Or just popcorn, if you hate discussion."}

But it's more often scum who give away their opportunity to influence the game (and there's a good word for that, but I couldn't think of it). In effect you are asking the confirmed townie for direction. Now, as said before I don't exactly know why it works. My best guess is that scum has more trouble making cases and arguing stuff then a normal townie and are therefor more likely to let someone else do the job. Still, do not like all this.<br><br>And beyond that, sorry to say this snifit, but I'm not entirely convinced of your capabilities. I do not mind the confirmed townie to make the final decisions, but I very much would enjoy some discussion with (majorly) townies to help him out.

Might be something to talk about. For example, I think it could be a nice idea to claim from least posts to most (which very conveniently places me last <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\"> ) esspecially as some people showed a correlation between posting frequency and allignment (ie. scum lurk, was shown for some games, a long time ago).

When he's town, usually my entrance into the game would spark some sort of banter, some him yelling at me, something like that. The fact that he has been lazily tunneling but not really caring whether his lynches go through or not is also fairly important because it shows that he has absolutely no interest in the game, does not care about the two mislynches, does not care about everything; which is telling me that the plan is just to lurk through the game and hopes the town lynches scummy town before lynching him."}

Gregory's weird posting about \"something being fishy\" when something would obviously be fishy in that situation makes absolutely no sense - you have to expect more claims to be town than there are town players in the game because duh, that's how this game works. Why even bring it up? You'll notice I didn't say \"trying to set up a buddy claim because that would be clever\", I just said \"trying to set up a buddy claim\" because that was the thing that made the most sense to me as a way to think that saying something that obviously dumb might somehow be a good idea.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Shadoweh wrote:</cite>His next post is explaining how specifically Gregory's vote on me doesn't make sense, ignoring the scum vote on me, and generally saying 'I don't agree yet but I will totally vote her if you convince me'.</div></blockquote><br><br>You realise that, when I said that nobody's vote on you was convincing, that includes, y'know, everybody who was voting for you.

If you go back and actually read the first few pages of the game, you will find that Shadoweh who is not a dude's mention of her gender was unprovoked.  I could care less about what gender anyone here is, but I am interested in why she had to make it public.  That, combined with her \"write me poems\" and bad aggressive posturing makes me conclude that either:<br>- she is from SRS, in which case batten down the hatches folks, its about to get crazy.<br>- she is attempting to use it as a tool to manipulate and evade any serious bandwagons (ie scum).<br><br>2. I did say it was weak, but that was because I misread the game.  <span class=\"noboldsig\">I have no qualms with putting Gregory at L-1, in fact someone should hammer.</span></div></blockquote><br><br>Congrats you made it onto my scumlist! No, we aren't going to lynch gregory. And seriously, what do you even think you are doing here? You have no qualms... but don't dare to vote. You ask for a hammer... but don't dare to vote.

And I agree that scum sort-of squandered their blocking power, and definitely shouldn't have claimed that much power (a bit more than usual made sense because it was a powerful scumteam, but not that much)."}
