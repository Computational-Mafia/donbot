The site-wide rules apply. Read them, know them, love them, do not break them.<br>\n2. Play to win.<br>\n3. Do not edit or delete your posts in this thread. If there is a problem with a post, such as incorrect formatting, ask me to fix it for you.<br>\n4. Do not quote communications outside the game thread, including role PMs, quicktopics, etc., in the game thread. This specifically includes PM timestamps. Paraphrasing is allowed. If in doubt, ask.<br>\n5. Do not use cryptography, invisible text, tiny text, or the like.<br>\n6. Do not use any form of provable randomness. Claiming you rolled dice and acting on that is fine. Using dice tags is not.<br>\n7. Do not impersonate or pretend to be the moderator. If I edit a post, I will use <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:orange\">this color</div></div>. Do not use this color.<br>\n8. Unless the moderator has specifically told you it is allowed, do not talk about this game outside of this game thread until it is completed.<br>\n9. Do not bring outside factors into this game. This includes, among other things, making bets, promises of real life rewards, etc.<br>\n10. Claiming scum by yourself is fine. Claiming scum with others is not, regardless of the truth of this claim.<br>\n11. Pretending to break a rule will be treated the same as breaking the rule.<br>\n12. We're all here to have fun. Tempers may flare, but avoid personal attacks and keep it civil.<br>\n13. Breaking one of these rules may, at my discretion, result in a modkill. If you are modkilled, you will become a Neutral Survivor, and thus automatically lose. Modkilling may or may not end the game day.<br>\n14. I reserve the right to change the rules. Rule changes will be posted in thread.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Activity Rules</div><br>\n1. If a player goes two days (48 real life hours) without posting, they may be prodded at my discretion, or upon being asked by another player. Prods will be announced in thread.<br>\n2. If a player does not respond to their prod within one day (24 real life hours), is prodded three times in the same game-day, or five times in total within the game, they may be force-replaced at my discretion.<br>\n3. If you will be V/LA, please alert me in the thread or via PM.<br>\n4. Each game day will have a deadline of two weeks (14 real life days).<br>\n5. In the event deadline is reached before a lynch has occurred, there will be No Lynch.<br>\n6. Each night will have a deadline of two days (48 hours).<br>\n7. If a player has a night action, but does not submit a choice before deadline, they will perform no action.<br>\n8. I may extend deadlines in the event replacements must be found, at my discretion. This will be announced in thread.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Voting Rules</div><br>\n1. Votes must be at the beginning of a new line and bolded, and in the format of <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">VOTE: Player name</div> or <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Playername</span>. Abbreviations, missing punctuation, and misspellings will be accepted as long as it is obvious to me who is being voted for. If I perceive it as a vote, it counts as a vote.<br>\n2. Unvoting is nice, but is not necessary.<br>\n3. Once a majority of votes is reached (# of players / 2 + 1, rounded down), that person is lynched.<br>\n4. All living players, including the lynchee, may continue to post until I lock the thread.<br>\n5. If you are dead, that is it. Do not post. Not even a \"Bah\" post.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Setup Rules</div><br>\n1. At least 1 player will get the Vanilla Townie role PM, which looks like this:<br>\n<fieldset style=\"border:3px outset grey;padding:5px 10px\">Welcome, [PlayerName], you are a <div style=\"display:inline;color:green\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vanilla Townie</div></div>.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Abilities:</div> Unfortunately, you have no abilities. However, you do have a vote. Use it wisely!<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Win Conditions:</div> You win if all threats to the town are eliminated and at least one town-aligned player is alive.</fieldset>", "time": "Sat Oct 31, 2015 2:18 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=64070&start=0", "forum": "53", "thread": "64070"}

Please show me where the progress has been made in those pages? There is no real progress as far as I can tell and much of what is discussed makes no sense to me and seems to have no relevance to the game.  I feel Blocky is scummy, his attitude at game start is aggressive and the only thing I see of relevance in the game so far that I can hang my hat on.   I do want to vote for Blocky but would like to see a vote count if at all possible before I do vote. As for sincerely doubting I as town would post that, hmmm you know me do you? how does what I say discredit your Ricastle wagon? are you a Dayvig? or am I right is assuming its a joke?  As for your vote do I question it? no, do I agree with it, not at the moment because as I said I cant see anything that is relevant. as for me being a Liar and oversharing, please point at the lie or lies; and oversharing, what doe's that mean, do explain?<br>\n<br>\nWhy someone disagreeing with your rather small attempt at a wagon would be an issue to you is actually interesting in itself, are you suggesting I should agree with your wagon?", "time": "Mon Nov 02, 2015 6:08 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=64070&start=125", "forum": "53", "thread": "64070"}

In the latter design, the Town seems to need the Gunsmith. The Tracker and the Roleblocker are weaker when the kill could be coming from more sources, and the Town already needs three correct lynches before three incorrect lynches.<br>\n<br>\nSo, I think that the case in which today is LYLO supports Ricastle's claim. Ricastle perhaps might be Mafia in the case that today is not LYLO (although I think that the false claim as the last surviving Mafia player would have been very bold), but in that case today is not LYLO. If today is LYLO, Ricastle should be Town and Pignash would have to be Mafia.", "time": "Sat Nov 28, 2015 9:15 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=64070&start=875", "forum": "53", "thread": "64070"}
