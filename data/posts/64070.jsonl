{"forum": "53", "thread": "64070", "pagelink": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=64070&start=0", "number": "1", "timestamp": "Sat Oct 31, 2015 8:18 am", "user": "Radja", "content": "<span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;\">Game Rules</span></span><br>(<span style=\"font-style: italic\">stolen and modified from Empire, Tierce, Magua, and callforjudgement</span>)<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">General Rules</span><br>1. The site-wide rules apply. Read them, know them, love them, do not break them.<br>2. Play to win.<br>3. Do not edit or delete your posts in this thread. If there is a problem with a post, such as incorrect formatting, ask me to fix it for you.<br>4. Do not quote communications outside the game thread, including role PMs, quicktopics, etc., in the game thread. This specifically includes PM timestamps. Paraphrasing is allowed. If in doubt, ask.<br>5. Do not use cryptography, invisible text, tiny text, or the like.<br>6. Do not use any form of provable randomness. Claiming you rolled dice and acting on that is fine. Using dice tags is not.<br>7. Do not impersonate or pretend to be the moderator. If I edit a post, I will use <span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: orange\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">this color</span></span></span>. Do not use this color.<br>8. Unless the moderator has specifically told you it is allowed, do not talk about this game outside of this game thread until it is completed.<br>9. Do not bring outside factors into this game. This includes, among other things, making bets, promises of real life rewards, etc.<br>10. Claiming scum by yourself is fine. Claiming scum with others is not, regardless of the truth of this claim.<br>11. Pretending to break a rule will be treated the same as breaking the rule.<br>12. We're all here to have fun. Tempers may flare, but avoid personal attacks and keep it civil.<br>13. Breaking one of these rules may, at my discretion, result in a modkill. If you are modkilled, you will become a Neutral Survivor, and thus automatically lose. Modkilling may or may not end the game day.<br>14. I reserve the right to change the rules. Rule changes will be posted in thread.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Activity Rules</span><br>1. If a player goes two days (48 real life hours) without posting, they may be prodded at my discretion, or upon being asked by another player. Prods will be announced in thread.<br>2. If a player does not respond to their prod within one day (24 real life hours), is prodded three times in the same game-day, or five times in total within the game, they may be force-replaced at my discretion.<br>3. If you will be V/LA, please alert me in the thread or via PM.<br>4. Each game day will have a deadline of two weeks (14 real life days).<br>5. In the event deadline is reached before a lynch has occurred, there will be No Lynch.<br>6. Each night will have a deadline of two days (48 hours).<br>7. If a player has a night action, but does not submit a choice before deadline, they will perform no action.<br>8. I may extend deadlines in the event replacements must be found, at my discretion. This will be announced in thread.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Voting Rules</span><br>1. Votes must be at the beginning of a new line and bolded, and in the format of <span class=\"noboldsig\">VOTE: Player name</span> or <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Playername</span>. Abbreviations, missing punctuation, and misspellings will be accepted as long as it is obvious to me who is being voted for. If I perceive it as a vote, it counts as a vote.<br>2. Unvoting is nice, but is not necessary.<br>3. Once a majority of votes is reached (# of players / 2 + 1, rounded down), that person is lynched.<br>4. All living players, including the lynchee, may continue to post until I lock the thread.<br>5. If you are dead, that is it. Do not post. Not even a \"Bah\" post.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Setup Rules</span><br>1. At least 1 player will get the Vanilla Townie role PM, which looks like this:<br><fieldset style=\"border:3px outset grey; padding:5px 10px\">Welcome, [PlayerName], you are a <span style=\"color: green\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vanilla Townie</span></span></span>.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Abilities:</span> Unfortunately, you have no abilities. However, you do have a vote. Use it wisely!<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Win Conditions:</span> You win if all threats to the town are eliminated and at least one town-aligned player is alive.</fieldset>"}

But hey, might as well turn a mediocre result and considerable influence into a full-blown attack on likely scum, right? Admittedly, I made an error in letting the wagon stay at L-1 as what I was more gunning for was more reactions from more people. I wasn't even entirely planning on lynching Cow really, at least not before seeing his reaction. <br><br>Regardless of your opinion on it, I believe it at least served to progress the gamestate out of what would likely have devolved into useless arguing and lurking, anyway. Plus, the PoE should be pretty simple from now on. That's what I'm going to be taking out of a townflip here.<br><br>Again, sorry for abusing my position of power like that. It sounded like a much better idea in my head, where I didn't properly factor in the eagerness of the other town to lynch a guilty claim. If this goes wrong I'll gladly accept any blame or scorn you'd like to deal to me. See you tomorrow."}

I have scummy feels coming from Blocky, Smudge, and a couple of yall besides that, but I am not ready for this day to end.<br><br>Blocky - as far as I am concerned, you are at L1 right now. We cannot put you at L1, because RC has intent to hammer, apparently. It could be yet another bluff, but this dude is a wildcard.<br><br>What do you guys think? Agree/disagree? Can we treat Blocky's L2 as virtual L1?</div></blockquote><br><br>I've got a scumread on KG, Ricastle.  I wasn't sure but after reading his ISO, this post seems really fake.  Like you don't look at all at what happened in the posts immediately preceding it?  Seems like he was trying to bus Blocky but couldn't because he'd already been lynched without him on the wagon.  It didn't ping me the first time through the thread but it did when I did my reread.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: KarmicGuide</span>"}

I think that the Town collectively made a number of errors (Tracker not submitting an action on Night Two when it's effectively a Cop check and not revealing the result on Radiant that is effectively a clear is a big one that I noticed). I did think that lynching Ricastle was bad, both because his claim was likely to be true if we were in LYLO and because he was unlikely to have been partners with Blocky. Then again, my vote only ended up on Pignash by accident, so it wasn't as though I had a great handle on the game either.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">@Mod</span><br>Thanks for running this one!"}
