If a 50% + 1 majority is not reached by deadline no lynch occurs.<br>\n3.) No Lynches require only 50% of the vote to occur.<br>\n4.) If a lynch occurs, the game enters twilight and players may continue to talk in thread until it is locked and a death scene is posted. No votes/unvotes will count in twilight.<br>\n5.) Dead players cannot talk. Once you are killed/lynched do not post in thread. Not even a \"bah!\" post.<br>\n6.)

Three total prods during the game will result in a replacement.<br>\n11.) If a player fails to pick up their prod and post in game within 24 hours they will be replaced.<br>\n12.)

Magikarp decided to wait and voted based on reaction. So he waited until he saw something worth voting on. I personally don't see why you're still pushing the RVS case at this time, especially when other things were being discussed (Magikarp's game experience / previous alignments / AtE-survival, etc.) I can't see why you're ignoring Magikarp's whole post (and argument surrounding him at that point) and going straight for the RVS smear.<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6158868#p6158868\" class=\"postlink\">Apathy12</a>, this makes me appreciate your posts a little more overall.<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6159145#p6159145\" class=\"postlink\">Again with the 2nd language comment.</a> Its almost insulting at this point.

If you're going to put it out there, put it all out there (as in name everyone guilty of it).<br>\n2) Its hard to not see wagon-jumpers as scum, but Apathy's statement there sure left funny vibes.<br>\n3) I agree that wagons in general, especially when they get close to lynch, can invoke reaction (if not only from the victim), but I don't want to see someone lynched before everyone's in the game.<br>\n4) While I agree that it can't be called an RVS-wagon once its at L-1, the fact that it reached L-1 during RVS sounds to me like an RVS-induced wagon.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display: inline; color:#000000 !important; background:#000000 !important; padding:0px 3px;\" title=\"This text is hidden to prevent spoilers; to reveal, highlight it with your cursor.\">\"I don't know who to RVS\" is indeed a scummy statement.

I *want* to give people the benefit of the doubt, as like I previously said I don't always feel like RVSing or that everyone *should*, but at the same time there truly is no harm in RVSing. And considering we know about Magikarp's previous games (where he was scum twice), its easy to see that being his frustration.<br>\n<br>\n5) To the last part; You can't really make a 'scummy' vote during RVS, unless you're hopping on a wagon with no meat behind it (at least that's usually how it comes off to me).<br>\n<br>\n <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_police.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"17\" alt=\":cop:\" title=\"Police\">", "time": "Thu Aug 28, 2014 11:21 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=58899&start=100", "forum": "53", "thread": "58899"}

The problem with scummy-looking players is two-fold.  One, town never likes to lynch because it seems to obvious, so messy scum can actually be left to live a lot longer than they should.  Two, these players can end up throwing off reads for days, as discussions keep coming back to them, which mafia couldn't be happier about.<br>\n<br>\nI think the final choice though, depends on how strong the reasons are for his actual scum-read.  If the reasons for your actual scum-read are weak, then maybe taking out the scummy-looking player can help town better focus on developing the real scum-reads as scum won't be able to hide behind the scummy-looking guy anymore, especially if we can't get together on someone that we feel is scum based on stronger reasons.", "time": "Tue Sep 02, 2014 2:09 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=58899&start=225", "forum": "53", "thread": "58899"}

I voted for Magikarp with an RVS vote, but the next guy to get on him had a reason for voting(Prolapsed) and the other guy who voted for him had the same reason too. Says though that Magikarp's frustration stems from him being Mafia again. I don't really know what he means with PL-type reasons for voting. He also says that people are afraid of making scummy votes because they want to gauge town's voting reactions.

I voted for Magikarp with an RVS vote, but the next guy to get on him had a reason for voting(Prolapsed) and the other guy who voted for him had the same reason too. Says though that Magikarp's frustration stems from him being Mafia again. I don't really know what he means with PL-type reasons for voting. He also says that people are afraid of making scummy votes because they want to gauge town's voting reactions.

I want to give an analogy but it eludes me right now.

He lurks then when finally asked for input, wallposts half a page of what was essentially summarizing the iso of each player here. Then goes back to lurking, then jumps on the 2birds wagon (I think?

Even if he isn't scum, he's still a waste of space when it comes to actually finding scum, which itself is anti-town. <br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\nHere's the thing about walls of text/analysis.  I think there are two circumstances where it can be scum.  One is where there is either no analysis or very basic analysis that town already agrees with.  The second is where the player paints certain posts by players in a different light than how they really come out(i.e. making his scum-buddies sound especially townish and making townies sound especially null).  If you think Ward did either of these things then fine, but I don't think he did.  <br>\n<br>\nOn another note, this VC is horrible.  We have 2birds at 3.  Prolapsed, Pijkachu, Apathy, and Lynx all at 2.  The problem is, there is a pretty decent case for all of them.  I think we'd be least happy lynching Pijkachu.  Most of what he has said can be potentially be written off as newbie/silly, so I'm wary of us lynching him.  Of 2birds1stone, Prolapsed, Apathy, and Lynx, I think Lynx has provided the most original content and input without as much scum-sounding as the others, so I think he's better to keep around for now than the other three.

To use your inexperience as a crutch in a conscious way requires a level of awareness of your own style that isn't really in line with how apathy has been posting.

From a town point of view, NM isn't an interesting target at all (and the \"wow\" is entirely off). NM was the most prolific poster and wasn't under any pressure. The only way I could see acryon finding the kill interesting is if there was some actual deliberation in the scum thread. 544 does nothing to mitigate this, there's no justification for his surprise, the reasoning is way too flat, and I don't buy that he wanted to get the day going giving his posting pattern D1.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\nInteresting =/= peculiar or shocking.

Will get more into this.<br>\n<br>\nso yeah<br>\n<br>\nOn a reread I can see how Magikarp could be noob-scum over noob-town.

Still, the option is there, and for a post that looks like it has bunches of content, it's unconvincing ultimately.

While it's probably likely he's just a VI, policy lynching him won't help us at all.  <br>\nMy main scumreads at the moment are Prolapsedand Antole roughly in order of confidence, with prolapsed being my strongest scumread. I townread Serra and 2birds.<br>\n<br>\nAntole:<br>\nVery little content, content provided is minimal and gives the impression of activity. I'm leaning scum coasting through the game, though it's only a mior scumread. Unlike Serra, it's not a problem I have with his posting habits (ie. his one-liners) but rather the fact his posts are just inherintly useless. The times where he does provide analysis, it's ambigious at best and can swing either way.<br>\nI also don't like the case you've presented against 2birds. Having a lot of scumspects isn't necessarily scummy. In fact, it's natural for reads to change to some extent over the course of the game. I've seen scum use that fallacy to get a townie lynched loads of times -- more than I can count -- and I'm willing to bet you are scum too for that. <br>\n<br>\nProlapsed:<br>\nWhy are you so happy about lynching a VI (magikarp)? I see no evidence that points to him being scum. This is his first game outside of the newbie queue so he's probably not used to the lack of guidance and support from everyone. Moreover, I don't like that you are only happy to give your reads out at L-1. I don't understand the NK speculation in #524 -- that goes for Acron too -- and how defensive you get after the resulting conversation about how 'scummy' or 'stupid' you are. <br>\nI heavily dislike the wording in #494.

I consider it scummy, bad logic or both. I'll talk more about that in a later point. My main issue here is that  you assert people get town points, or scumpoints from someone getting NKed. Why?<br>\n-#576: But Naked votes can be helpful at times, such as to make wagons equal for VCA purposes; or to deliberately withhold information to prevent scum from parroting it.<br>\n-#578: Why do you attack Serra for him commenting on your poor NK speculation? NK spec does come from scum 90% of the time.<br>\n-Here's my main one. Lots of times, you say you're not interested in lynching Karp. In #652, you say 'definitely not interested in lynching the probable VI', and you also defend him in #263 and #330. But then in #808 you just vote for him. Do you think he isn't just a VI anymore and just looks like one or is trying to act like one, if you say 'I hate pursuing lynches that look like VIs'?  If you think Karp is just scum (and not VI), can you explain how you take the opposite stance to Ward in #706, where you say Ward is probably just 'newb-town'?  You even go as far to hardcore defend Majikarp in #654 saying he's not a 'massive liability' and we should just 'ignore him'. There's quite a sharp contrast in viewpoints on Karp's behaviour that makes me feel your vote is just opportunistic. I've summarised what I think about the case, that it's very generalised and can be applied to any VI-ish looking player. #819 is blatantly damage control and is trying to avoid blame going to you for Karp's mislynch.<br>\n-#768, which is some more NK speculation. I respond to that point, and he replies with very ambiguous and careful wording citing \"I agree with your viewpoints but I don't 100% agree\".<br>\n<br>\nIn a nutshell: NK analysis views are strange and adament and doesn't do a good job defending it.

I dislike that 'case' and think it's scummy to push such a thing. I see you as a reasonably experienced player -- you're not a newbie -- so such case strikes me as odd. It's not scummy to have lots of scumreads. Paranoid, maybe, but scum, no. <br>\n-#348 is an overreaction.

Although the claim is true it bugs me how he points it out like this. It's too much of a 'get out of jail free card' for me to ignore.

Each vote count in Day 1 literally only had (assumed) conftown on it, and while it was pushed pretty early on day 3 by unconfirmed (scum-driven), it pretty quickly went back to only being town votees once pacman became a counterwagon. This is pretty strong evidence of Phijkachu scum. I can def see Anatole and chaos trying to bus their partner that is most likely going to die that day phase quickly, then hopping off when it becomes less likely.<br>\n<br>\nThe apathy wagon doesn't really mean anything. The only unconfirmed not on the first five votes of that wagon was my predecessor, so it's pretty clear that it was heavily scum-driven regardless of who the scumteam is.<br>\n<br>\nserrapaladin wagon sprung up alongside the town-driven acryon wagon.
