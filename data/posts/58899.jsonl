Votes must be bolded and in a form similar to <span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: Playername</span> or <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Playername</span>. If I do not see your vote, it will not count. Unvotes are nice but not required.<br>2.) Lynches require a majority of votes (50% of the living players +1). If a 50% + 1 majority is not reached by deadline no lynch occurs.<br>3.) No Lynches require only 50% of the vote to occur.<br>4.) If a lynch occurs, the game enters twilight and players may continue to talk in thread until it is locked and a death scene is posted. No votes/unvotes will count in twilight.<br>5.) Dead players cannot talk. Once you are killed/lynched do not post in thread. Not even a \"bah!\" post.<br>6.) All actions will be resolved using the Natural Action Resolution system.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Deadlines/Activity</span><br><br>7.) Each Day will have a two week deadline.<br>8.) I will consider deadline extensions on an individual basis.<br>9.) Treat this game as a commitment. If you are going to be V/LA please post in thread or send me a PM.<br>10.) Players must post every 72 hours (unless they have noted V/LA) or they will be prodded. Three total prods during the game will result in a replacement.<br>11.) If a player fails to pick up their prod and post in game within 24 hours they will be replaced.<br>12.) Each night will last approximately 48 hours, during which time all night actions must be submitted via PM.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">General</span><br><br>13.) Have fun and be respectful to your fellow players.<br>14.) Do not speak about this game outside of the thread unless your role specifies that you may do so.<br>15.) Do not quote anything from the moderator that is said outside of this thread (including role PMs) or pretend to quote anything from the moderator. Paraphrasing is allowed but if you are questioning your paraphrase, run it by me first.<br>16.) If I make a mistake, please address your grievance in bold in thread or in PM. Please point out vote count errors in thread only.<br>17.) Do not edit posts. Do not use invisible text. Do not use small text.<br>18.) At least one person received the following PM:<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Hello, XXXX, and welcome to Mini-Normal #XXXX!<br><br>You are a Vanilla Townie. You have no special abilities.

Magikarp decided to wait and voted based on reaction. So he waited until he saw something worth voting on. I personally don't see why you're still pushing the RVS case at this time, especially when other things were being discussed (Magikarp's game experience / previous alignments / AtE-survival, etc.) I can't see why you're ignoring Magikarp's whole post (and argument surrounding him at that point) and going straight for the RVS smear.<br><br><a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6158868#p6158868\" class=\"postlink\">Apathy12</a>, this makes me appreciate your posts a little more overall.<br><br><a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6159145#p6159145\" class=\"postlink\">Again with the 2nd language comment.</a> Its almost insulting at this point.

I think any of the votes on Magikarp are bad so there's nothing to compare as far as towniness vs. scumminess. But like I said, there's an interesting context between yours and acryon's responses to Magikarp wagon which seemed authentic and 70 which does not. And for me one of the biggest scum tells is people trying too hard to look concerned for town as in \"good town wouldn't blah blah blah\" or \"blah blah blah risky for town\" or \"blah blah town should or shouldn't do what I, as the arbiter of proper town behavior, think is appropriate,\" is about as scummy as it gets."}

He also says that people are afraid of making scummy votes because they want to gauge town's voting reactions.

I can see how that's good, it's dangerous though, but when it pays off I think it pays off. Disagrees with Anatole(#80) that Magikarp's L-1 was an RVS wagon. I disagree too, so I agree with him here. I voted for Magikarp with an RVS vote, but the next guy to get on him had a reason for voting(Prolapsed) and the other guy who voted for him had the same reason too. Says though that Magikarp's frustration stems from him being Mafia again. I don't really know what he means with PL-type reasons for voting. He also says that people are afraid of making scummy votes because they want to gauge town's voting reactions.

I don't agree with this. If you kill players early, you lose the chance of more interaction from all the players. Interaction that is vital to town as hard evidence, we can't case people if we just go for the seemingly scummiest person and hammer, what do we do next if we always do that? RVS again?

I want to give an analogy but it eludes me right now.

He lurks then when finally asked for input, wallposts half a page of what was essentially summarizing the iso of each player here. Then goes back to lurking, then jumps on the 2birds wagon (I think? I don't know if that vote is legit or not. Regardless, it's still shitposting). Pretty scummy. Even if he isn't scum, he's still a waste of space when it comes to actually finding scum, which itself is anti-town. <br></div></blockquote><br>Here's the thing about walls of text/analysis.  I think there are two circumstances where it can be scum.  One is where there is either no analysis or very basic analysis that town already agrees with.  The second is where the player paints certain posts by players in a different light than how they really come out(i.e. making his scum-buddies sound especially townish and making townies sound especially null).  If you think Ward did either of these things then fine, but I don't think he did.  <br><br>On another note, this VC is horrible.  We have 2birds at 3.  Prolapsed, Pijkachu, Apathy, and Lynx all at 2.  The problem is, there is a pretty decent case for all of them.  I think we'd be least happy lynching Pijkachu.  Most of what he has said can be potentially be written off as newbie/silly, so I'm wary of us lynching him.  Of 2birds1stone, Prolapsed, Apathy, and Lynx, I think Lynx has provided the most original content and input without as much scum-sounding as the others, so I think he's better to keep around for now than the other three.  So, let's take a look at 2birds, Prolapsed, and Apathy.  <br><br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">2birds1stone</span><br>-<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6153477#p6153477\">8</a>.  Obviously this first vote is terrible.  Who wants a quicklynch?  Nobody.  That being said, I'm not so sure that scum would ever actually say this.  <br>-<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6153520#p6153520\">11</a> provided a crappy reasoning for 8.  <br>-<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6160175#p6160175\">114</a> in general is pretty good.

Looking at his ISO as a whole again, he actually has pretty good reasoning for the stuff he's saying, and the scummy things he has done read more as a townie saying dumb things(8 and 11 specifically) than actually scummy.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: </span><br><br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Prolapsed</span><br>-<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6154281#p6154281\">23</a> is a little weird.

All I can say about it.<br>-<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6157513#p6157513\">39</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6158133#p6158133\">68</a> concerning Magikarp make sense, but it also seems like a great opportunity for scum to start a wagon that appears legitimate, and Prolapsed took it.<br>-Obviously I disagree with his disagreement with me on my points around <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6158654#p6158654\">84</a> and the others, but I don't think it's scummy.<br>-<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6164584#p6164584\">160</a>.  I don't really like when people call out scum-slips so confidently, especially when they most likely aren't.  <br>-<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6170119#p6170119\">191</a> sucks, as he moved on from someone he thought did something actually scummy, to someone he thought wasn't contributing.  The wink implies some jokey-ness to it, but if that's the case I don't like it either.<br>-<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6188083#p6188083\">281</a> rectifies this and he goes back to Magikarp.  Fine.<br>-<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6188279#p6188279\">283</a> sucks as has already been pointed out a number of times.  I also don't buy his defense of it in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6194305#p6194305\">334</a>.  If you read it, then comment on it.  If you didn't then don't.  This awkward in-between just reads so weird.  Additionally, EPM said he was happy with the 2birds1stone wagon, but you think they could be team-mates.  I've seen some interesting scum-acts on D1 before, but EPM was pretty damning on 2birds IMO, so I don't buy this at all right now.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Apathy</span><br>-<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6157873#p6157873\">59</a> is horrible, as was pointed out many times.  No getting around that.<br>-<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6158455#p6158455\">73</a> is non-neutral and non-bandwagon, which gets town-points from me.<br>-<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6160863#p6160863\">127</a> is similarly non-neutral and original, so more town-points.<br>-<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6164327#p6164327\">156</a> is weird for sure.  It can sort of read to me as scum trying to say something ultra-neutral and objective in an effort to look town.  This one gets scum-points from me.<br>-<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6165107#p6165107\">161</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6165119#p6165119\">162</a> get even weirder.  Especially 161 just sounds like mafia trying really hard to appear objective, but I think he got too deep in and things came apart.<br>-<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6178354#p6178354\">214</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=6178615#p6178615\">218</a> continue the scum-vibes for me.  \"Hey guys, we should lynch this guy.  But just to make sure you all know, if we lynch him and it turns out he's town, it doesn't mean I'm scum!\"  He's trying a little too hard in all of these posts to make clear we don't try to connect a Pijkachu town-flip to him being scum.

I already commented directly on why this post was so wrong.  <br><br>Looking at the major suspects at this time, I definitely think that Apathy has the best case against him.  The others had some weird activity, but Apathy had the most and the scummiest posts IMO.  Hopefully this little look into things will help us get more focused in a certain direction.

Why he has not been attacked more for his refusal to engage? Why he has been allowed to slip by with little to no pressure outside of me and EPM? This playerlist is not incapable of mobilising a wagon and have it grow quickly, just look at Magikarp and 2bird's. Lynx is scum. He has no business in LyLo regardless."}

To use your inexperience as a crutch in a conscious way requires a level of awareness of your own style that isn't really in line with how apathy has been posting. I find the more likely explanation that he simply doesn't have much experience (at least in this format), and has made some mistakes in his analysis, leading to his erratic voting, jumping back from NM onto Karp. He could still be newb-scum, but I see newb-town as more likely.<br><br>@magikarp: how much of your apathy vote is because he was attacking you earlier?"}

From a town point of view, NM isn't an interesting target at all (and the \"wow\" is entirely off). NM was the most prolific poster and wasn't under any pressure. The only way I could see acryon finding the kill interesting is if there was some actual deliberation in the scum thread. 544 does nothing to mitigate this, there's no justification for his surprise, the reasoning is way too flat, and I don't buy that he wanted to get the day going giving his posting pattern D1.<br></div></blockquote><br>Interesting =/= peculiar or shocking.

It could very easily be that he just doesn't know how people usually act and respond in games or just has that weird play-style.  It could just as easily be that he is playing crazy because generally town won't lynch people like him, because his extreme defensiveness seems almost too scummy to actually be scummy.  I've seen almost his exact style played many times before, and in my experience it doesn't really point definitively to scum or town.</div></blockquote><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6198994#p6198994\" class=\"postlink\">post 380</a>, acryon wrote:</cite>On another note, this VC is horrible.

I townread Serra and 2birds.<br><br>Antole:<br>Very little content, content provided is minimal and gives the impression of activity. I'm leaning scum coasting through the game, though it's only a mior scumread. Unlike Serra, it's not a problem I have with his posting habits (ie. his one-liners) but rather the fact his posts are just inherintly useless. The times where he does provide analysis, it's ambigious at best and can swing either way.<br>I also don't like the case you've presented against 2birds. Having a lot of scumspects isn't necessarily scummy. In fact, it's natural for reads to change to some extent over the course of the game. I've seen scum use that fallacy to get a townie lynched loads of times -- more than I can count -- and I'm willing to bet you are scum too for that. <br><br>Prolapsed:<br>Why are you so happy about lynching a VI (magikarp)? I see no evidence that points to him being scum. This is his first game outside of the newbie queue so he's probably not used to the lack of guidance and support from everyone. Moreover, I don't like that you are only happy to give your reads out at L-1. I don't understand the NK speculation in #524 -- that goes for Acron too -- and how defensive you get after the resulting conversation about how 'scummy' or 'stupid' you are. <br>I heavily dislike the wording in #494. Switching votes so 'someone can hammer' isn't a legitimate reason and sounds incredibly scummy to me. <br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Prolapsed</span>"}

In #652, you say 'definitely not interested in lynching the probable VI', and you also defend him in #263 and #330. But then in #808 you just vote for him. Do you think he isn't just a VI anymore and just looks like one or is trying to act like one, if you say 'I hate pursuing lynches that look like VIs'?  If you think Karp is just scum (and not VI), can you explain how you take the opposite stance to Ward in #706, where you say Ward is probably just 'newb-town'?  You even go as far to hardcore defend Majikarp in #654 saying he's not a 'massive liability' and we should just 'ignore him'. There's quite a sharp contrast in viewpoints on Karp's behaviour that makes me feel your vote is just opportunistic. I've summarised what I think about the case, that it's very generalised and can be applied to any VI-ish looking player. #819 is blatantly damage control and is trying to avoid blame going to you for Karp's mislynch.<br>-#768, which is some more NK speculation.

Cop, is however, quite a common role for town to have and it would take a lot of gusto for scum to fakeclaim that. Indeed, scum also have the burden, when fakeclaiming cop, to provide 'results' from investigation. Why would scum risk claiming a role that is 99% of the time likely to be CCed when they can claim less common roles such as, say, Jailkeeper or Roleblocker? Scum won't gambit with a common role when they can play it safe by claiming another.

Although the claim is true it bugs me how he points it out like this. It's too much of a 'get out of jail free card' for me to ignore.

This is pretty strong evidence of Phijkachu scum. I can def see Anatole and chaos trying to bus their partner that is most likely going to die that day phase quickly, then hopping off when it becomes less likely.<br><br>The apathy wagon doesn't really mean anything. The only unconfirmed not on the first five votes of that wagon was my predecessor, so it's pretty clear that it was heavily scum-driven regardless of who the scumteam is.<br><br>serrapaladin wagon sprung up alongside the town-driven acryon wagon. More likely than not both of the wagonees are scum (Anatole + chaos).<br><br>Riddleton slot is kinda meh.
