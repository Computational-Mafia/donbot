Ignorance of the rule set is not an excuse for breaking my rules. In particular rule 6/7, 13, and 17 are not standard and you should make sure you're aware of them.<br><br>1.) Have fun. This is not an option. Games are only good when players are having fun. If you are not having fun, replace out. There is no shame in this. I have no problem with it. You are not a bad person. Both you and the game will be happier for it.<br><br>2.) The mod is always right. Always. Yes, even then. However, if you think there\u2019s some confusion, and it absolutely can\u2019t wait until the end of the game, send me a PM; do not break my game because you died when you didn\u2019t think you should\u2019ve. <br><br>3.) Days will continue until one of three things happen: a player is lynched, No Lynch gets a majority of the votes, or a deadline passes. <br><br>4) Voting must be done in the format Vote: Shea. Don't worry about unvoting, I don't care. <br><br>5) I will post a vote count every now and then. I am not infallible in this aspect (\u201dBut Sir, didn\u2019t you say-- *cough, choke, shudder, die*\u201d) and if you think the vote count is off, say so and I will double check it. Do this in a PM. In fact:<br><br>6) Please do not communicate with the mod in thread. Mod communication should not take place in the game thread. If I feel your question has an answer that the rest of the town needs to know about, I will make a game announcement. If you attempt to claim this is due to a question you asked I will count that as quoting mod communication. Speaking of which:<br><br>7) Do NOT quote your role PMs, OR any other form of communication from me unless it is something I have already posted on this thread. This is a modkillable offense. Depending on severity of the infraction you might get a warning instead of a modkill. Don't test this. You probably won't. Two warnings is an automatic modkill.<br><br>8) Do not discuss the game outside of the game thread unless your role allows you to, in which case you may only do it during the specified times with the specified players. This is a modkillable offense. <br><br>9) You\u2019re required to post regularly. I prod after 2 days of inactivity and replace after 1 day of no response to the prod. This rule is flexible if you PM me in advance. Please be mindful, I will not be checking the V/LA banners or signatures. That's not my job. If you have information posted there I expect you to send me a PM as well. <br><br>10) Once you\u2019re dead, you\u2019re no longer subject to the previous rule. As a matter of fact, once you\u2019re dead, stop posting. I will permit one simple \u201cbah\u201d post and nothing more. Please make sure that there is absolutely NO game relevant information in this post. Yes, even \u201cgo scum\u201d is game relevant. Don\u2019t do it. <br><br>11) In the event of a modkill, it will end the day. <br><br>12) A lynch is reached when a player receives a majority of possible votes. (I.E. if there are 13 votes it would take 7 votes to lynch.)<br><br>13)My no-lynch policy (stolen from coron): No lynch only requires there to be enough votes that the remaining votes could not successfully create a lynch. For example, with 12 possible votes, it would be 7 to lynch but only 6 to no lynch because the remaining 6 could not lynch.<br><br>14) If a deadline passes without a player or No Lynch receiving a majority of the votes, the day will end with NO LYNCH. <br><br>15) In the event of a failure to lynch, the days in this game will last 7 days. I know that's short, but I think you can do it. <br><br>16) Nights will last 2 days from me posting the scene and locking the thread. If you don't get your choices in, your default action is NO ACTION.<br><br>17) There will not be a Dead thread for this game. See rule about talking about ongoing games. <br><br>18) The makeup of this game is 6 Anti-town roles and 7 Town roles.<br><br>19) <div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: at least one person has received this pm</b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display: none;\"><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>You are a vanilla townie.

I saw Kappy trying to \"get a rise\" out of KTS more than just a scumhunting reaction. The egging on, mocking grammar etc. looked like trying to provoke a blowup. KTS, Kappy, and I just finished a game where KTS got wrongly scumread by many after going off a bit. Thought Kappy might've been going for something clever in getting the ball rolling on KTS. <br>Don't know how much you all are relying on that little dynamic between the two of them in scumreading KTS, but I see Kappy as scummy for making the play."}

There is no reason for a town member to defend someone weakly. Either there is a solid reason someone is town that would logically prevent them from being lynched (a good claim, for instance) or there is a soft bullshit reason reason for keeping them alive. Every time I see someone defend someone else it begs the question, \"why?\". What initiative does a town member have to defend a player that is soft town-null? There is none. The only reason someone would come out and <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">randomly defend</span> someone else is if they had a self-interested reason in defending someone. This is scummy. Town's motivation is collective survival, scum motivation is for individual players to survive. Thus defending players is scummy. If you buy meta bullshit you can look this up in pretty much all of my games going back ~two years and you will note:<br><br>1) I rarely defend players, normally refraining from such until d3 or later provided no contingent bullshit claims.<br>2) I have called out players on this \"tell\" before.<br>3) I am right and you are wrong.<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7969779#p7969779\" class=\"postlink\">post 342</a>, Killthestory wrote:</cite>fuck his claim</div></blockquote><br>^why?

There is absolutely nothing the scum can do in this situation but follow suit.<br>At Night, the dilemma shifts to the scum. The only way for either scum to win is for them to shoot the other scum. But if both scum do this, then the Townie(s) will be the only player(s) alive, and the Town will win. This is a disheartening outcome so late in the game!<br>The other option, shooting the Townie, is clearly suboptimal. Going with the three-player example above, if the Mafioso shoots the Townie and the Serial Killer shoots the Mafioso, the Serial Killer wins (and the Mafioso feels dumb afterward). Thus, to the scum, the choice is between giving victory to the other scum or the Townie.<br>It is worth noting that depending on the moderator, if BOTH scum shoot the Townie, the result is a draw. Since a draw is less than a win, there is no real reason to not shoot the other scum. (Or is there? See Caveats below.)<br>Thus, the Town will always win</fieldset></div></blockquote>"}

There is no reason for a town member to defend someone weakly. Either there is a solid reason someone is town that would logically prevent them from being lynched (a good claim, for instance) or there is a soft bullshit reason reason for keeping them alive. Every time I see someone defend someone else it begs the question, \"why?\". What initiative does a town member have to defend a player that is soft town-null? There is none. The only reason someone would come out and <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">randomly defend</span> someone else is if they had a self-interested reason in defending someone. This is scummy. Town's motivation is collective survival, scum motivation is for individual players to survive. Thus defending players is scummy. If you buy meta bullshit you can look this up in pretty much all of my games going back ~two years and you will note:<br><br>1) I rarely defend players, normally refraining from such until d3 or later provided no contingent bullshit claims.<br>2) I have called out players on this \"tell\" before.<br>3) I am right and you are wrong.<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7969779#p7969779\" class=\"postlink\">post 342</a>, Killthestory wrote:</cite>fuck his claim</div></blockquote><br>^why?
