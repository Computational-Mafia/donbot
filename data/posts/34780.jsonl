Unfortunately there are some amongst you that are not real Geologists (Town).... There are Geographers (Mafia) amongst the crowd for you to find.

You see right now we are sitting at 3/13 players being scum. We have a lynch pool of 13. Tomorrow, if we can't eliminate anyone as conf town, we stand at 3/11. If we have a quick lynch that happen rapidly we can assume that there are scum in that 7 player bandwagon, so the denominator of the fraction gets reduced significantly. 3/7 or 2/7 (assuming one scum stayed off) is greater than 3/11.

I'll give some more thoughts on what's happened in the game tomorrow, not that there's been a lot since my last post, and anything I forget regarding tool.<br>\n<br>\nRegarding Tool: I didn't think his initial reaction to Taylor (#21) was terribly scummy, but I did think that it was the scummiest we had at that point (well, about the only thing). Hence I decided to start with my vote there to see reactions/get the game going. I didn't really like the reactions I got. His posts didn't feel genuine/forced, defensive and jumped on the first opportunity to direct us elsewhere (Naio, which I think is a scummy/terrible wagon in general). Once the attention started to shift to the Naio wagon (that he started) he made no intentions of analysing/questioning the responses from Naio, he simply left the vote there and stopped posting until it started to lose steam.<br>\n<br>\nHis posts after that are decent to me (#127 feels a little town). That being said, those posts would be very easy to make as scum as well, the questions are obvious/already made elsewhere. When he isn't actively pressured (I don't think he is atm, despite being at L-2) he doesn't really seem to have any incentive of providing content. Most people have been posting quite little in general though, so I guess this doesn't mean too much. I will admit that I don't think the case on tool is far from strong, I'm just not sure if I have a better one atm.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nThat being said, O wouldn't really mind a wagon on Cool either, not sure which one I find scummier atm. Those are the only two (you would've been the third before this page) I'm fine voting for atm, I feel kinda unable to read TSO and regarding the rest I'm leaning town/null or they simply haven't provided enough content yet.

BINGO. TSO's post 135 says it better than I ever could. <br>\n<br>\nnaio is pretty clearly newbie town. i really liked his responses to kaze's push in 96, and again in 121. he's been willing to explain himself and his posts sound really genuine. (as opposed to tool's posts, that come off completely fabricated).<br>\n<br>\nCooldog has been defending tool unreasonably, and starting with 81, I'm getting really bad vibes here. I want to tighten this read up with mastin. I really don't like the way he went after naio, who I'm getting gut town feelings from. His statement about naio's 54 coming from scum motivation seems really forced. Whatt's interesting is that snifit's statement following, in 83, seems more from a town mindset of \"well he looks town to me, why don't you see that too\" as opposed to trying to justify the bad things tool has said. i also dont like his quicklynch justification in 103. <br>\n<br>\nbenmage's reads and read progression are really following my own. I cant really see that kind of fluidity coming from scum. the fact that he can read naio (see 122) also tells me he's most likely town. i also really like the fact that he's townhunting. i completely agree with his 142. that's exactly what i do on d1. @ben, i'm a little wary of forcing a town block though, especially one that includes kaze at this time (and the fact that mastin has vouched your awesomeness, i'm willing to trust his read on you). however, i think you may be mistaken in \"confirming\" kaze as town right now. <br>\n<br>\nTSO: i don't think it's appropriate to say such things (\"If Benmage is scum, Kaze too is scum\") especially pre-flip. your posts have not given me much to work with. <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":neutral:\" title=\"Neutral\"> and then pinkmittens takes the words out of my mouth in 132. nice. your 134 suggests you have experience with ben and kaze. can you elaborate on your theory, please?<br>\n<br>\nShos catchup post... *sigh* i always have trouble reading shos and TSO.

I said that because you could not determine the motivation behind our early \"reads\" list, you clearly were not coming from the same mindset. You felt it necessary to ask \"Why did you post that?\" indicating that you, in fact, did not know why, and could not come up with a reason why, thus you were not thinking from a townie POV, or you would know why. It has absolutely nothing to do with disagreement, and the fact that you attempt to twist this into \"anyone who disagrees with you is scummy\", is itself scummy.<br>\n<br>\n--------<br>\n<br>\nPretty sure I addressed the vote before justification as being less of a point of evidence and more a supporting item. Of course you will find townies who do it, and of course you will find scum who don't. You will also find townies who self vote and scum who scumhunt. The fact of the matter is that it is simply one of many marks against your play here.<br>\n<br>\n--------<br>\n<br>\nYou were asking questions to hear the answers and then follow up? Please show me where you \"followed up\". (Hint: You haven't.) Empty questions are a huge indication of the lack of purpose behind those questions. <br>\n<br>\n--------<br>\n<br>\nYes, I think you are lying about your reads, because you don't have any. Your post looked as though you did it to get the heat off you. It is my observation. You cannot simply say my observation is wrong if I observed it. It's not like I just came up with it out of nowhere. It is there in the thread for anyone to see. <br>\n<br>\n--------<br>\n<br>\nI find it interested that you say we have been lurking, and you vote us for it (supposedly), but you have yet to actually apply pressure to anyone who has <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">actually</div> been lurking. You might want to check my site history. Everytime I've been able to post, I have. <br>\n<br>\nSo please. Who is the one who is lying? You are straight up accusing me of doing something I haven't ever done, as either alignment. <br>\n<br>\nAlso, I don't know if you noticed but um.... we're the only vote on you. Why are you freaking out so bad?<br>\n<br>\n--------<br>\n<br>\nThere is a big difference between being realistic about your reads, and leaving the door open for you to vote, as you did with Naio in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5524434#p5524434\">186</a>.<br>\n<br>\n--------<br>\n<br>\nTSO said: \"If Benmage is scum, Kaze too is scum.\" You replied, \"I can dig it. But how would Kaze be scum?\" shos questioned you about it, since if you actually understood what TSO was saying, you wouldn't be asking that question, and then you respond that \"that's not what I meant\". Which is exactly what I said you did. Because that's what you did. I am positing the motivation behind it, which is my prerogative. It is absolutely valid. <br>\n<br>\nAnd yes? I stated the FACT that you did not ever explain why you thought Benmage was scum if Kaze was scum. Ever. Despite making such a bold claim.<br>\n<br>\n---------<br>\n<br>\nNo. You are not understanding. You are distancing yourself from the situation. You are discrediting it. You have consistently called Kaze a townread, yet attempt to discredit why he is a townread. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">This kind of inconsistency is what makes me think you are scum.</div><br>\n<br>\n---------<br>\n<br>\nThe point is, that you are using a single example of meta, and only this single point of information, for a broad, sweeping, strong as fuck townread on Kaze. This is unrealistic and not town-minded. This is confirmation bias coming from scum who knows who is town and who is not.<br>\n<br>\n---------<br>\n<br>\nI explained what my impression of your last post was, which is to rush a lynch.

I've read through the previous stuff as well, but I'll need to go a bit more into detail to get my thoughts sorted (and I'm still fairly busy irl, I apologize).<br>\n<br>\nThoughts:<br>\nCooldog wagon built very quickly even considering the circumstances (town=easier to lynch+end of the day). Considering that, the fact that we didn't need a majority (plurality) and that people were very easily swayed into voting for it it feels fairly safe to say that we have 1-2 scum on it.<br>\n<br>\nThink Benmages flip strengthens the town reads on Naio &amp; Kaze slightly, he was such a die-hard defender that keeping him alive would be more beneficial than the slight town gain they (imo) get from killing him. Don&#8217;t really think looking at his suspects is worth that much, he wasn&#8217;t really scumhunting nearly as much as he was townhunting so I doubt this caused his death (though it could've had an impact). So yeah, liking shos view on it. Think Kaze is overcomplicating it/trying to hammer in that he&#8217;s town in #414, this post is in all honesty pretty terrible. If the reason for the kill is that Kaze was a threat, just kill him? It&#8217;s not like it&#8217;d be easy to push a Kaze lynch today with or without Benmage (and tool definitely isn't in position to do a 180 and push for a Kaze lynch).<br>\n<br>\n#411. Taylor town-reading me seems off, my D-1 performance is pretty much terrible.<br>\n<br>\n#417. Reason? Just the same as Kaze? Think that logic is very far-fetched/almost pure wifom.<br>\n<br>\n#418. A hydra misinterpreting a (to me) pretty obvious post, at best that&#8217;s two people not reading through posts properly (which I feel is far easier to do if you first decide on a target, and then look for evidence supporting that) and at worst it&#8217;s simply to discredit. Scummy either way. I think I saw a post where someone did this exact thing a few pages back, if that was EK as well this behaviour is very scummy. I'll go take a look.<br>\nI do agree with the rest of the post though.<br>\n<br>\n#424. I can definitely see people reading me as scum, but this case might be the worst case I&#8217;ve witnessed, why is fairly self-explanatory. Admittedly I don&#8217;t think tools previous posts/reads (in both this game and previous ones) have made much sense either, so I can&#8217;t be sure if he&#8217;s being silly or scum. The fact that the votes on him right now are really bad (not even one decent reason), does make me feel a bit uncomfortable voting him as well.<br>\n<br>\nNot the right person to call him out on it (pot kettle), but Jacobs lurking is a bit scummy at this point. Flying under the radar entirely, and still making posts (although short) in other threads.<br>\n<br>\nTSO. His play makes more sense as scum than town (but doesn't really make much sense as either), and he&#8217;s being purposely anti-town. Scum will never nk him, and he can't be around for endgame, meaning that he needs to be lynched. Better to do that sooner than later (less info now than later), so I think he's the best lynch right now, just unfortunate is that we didn&#8217;t do that yesterday.<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: TSO</span>", "time": "Mon Dec 30, 2013 10:07 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=34780&start=425", "forum": "53", "thread": "34780"}

Simply the fact that they chose to play anti-town is very scummy, since the only valid reason I can think off for doing that is to make themselves harder to read.

You know when I get into a game I can be useful but you also know when I'm not I'm a terrible, terrible player.

Hence I decided to start with my vote there to see reactions/get the game going. I didn't really like the reactions I got. His posts didn't feel genuine/forced, defensive and jumped on the first opportunity to direct us elsewhere (Naio, which I think is a scummy/terrible wagon in general). Once the attention started to shift to the Naio wagon (that he started) he made no intentions of analysing/questioning the responses from Naio, he simply left the vote there and stopped posting until it started to lose steam. His posts after that are decent to me (#127 feels a little town). That being said, those posts would be very easy to make as scum as well, the questions are obvious/already made elsewhere. When he isn't actively pressured (I don't think he is atm, despite being at L-2) he doesn't really seem to have any incentive of providing content. Most people have been posting quite little in general though, so I guess this doesn't mean too much. I will admit that I don't think the case on tool is far from strong, I'm just not sure if I have a better one atm. That being said, O wouldn't really mind a wagon on Cool either, not sure which one I find scummier atm. Those are the only two (you would've been the third before this page) I'm fine voting for atm, I feel kinda unable to read TSO and regarding the rest I'm leaning town/null or they simply haven't provided enough content yet.

His posts didn't feel genuine/forced, defensive and jumped on the first opportunity to direct us elsewhere (Naio, which I think is a scummy/terrible wagon in general). Once the attention started to shift to the Naio wagon (that he started) he made no intentions of analysing/questioning the responses from Naio, he simply left the vote there and stopped posting until it started to lose steam. His posts after that are decent to me (#127 feels a little town). That being said, those posts would be very easy to make as scum as well, the questions are obvious/already made elsewhere. When he isn't actively pressured (I don't think he is atm, despite being at L-2) he doesn't really seem to have any incentive of providing content. Most people have been posting quite little in general though, so I guess this doesn't mean too much. I will admit that I don't think the case on tool is far from strong, I'm just not sure if I have a better one atm.

You haven't asked me any useful questions, you haven't tried to talk to me, asked for reads, nothing. You're just standing there and getting manipulated and you don't even notice.<br>\n<br>\nYou still have posted NOTHING substantial on me being scummy, you still haven't gone after PinkMittens once, you still haven't done anything. You watched PinkMittens violently sidestep to avoid questions and changed your vote back so fast I'm nearly convinced you were trying to fake paranoia and you're just terrible at doing it. At this stage I'm basically done with you. If you want to actually look Town, if you want to actually contribute, it's time to step up. Otherwise, take a back seat and watch the Town crumble.</div></div></div></div></blockquote>\nstarting with this post, I think. if I find that I need to, I'll go back to read earlier.<br>\nSo firstly, <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: </span>. I'm not sure who I was last voting(you'll get it soon TSO no worries) but in case it was you, unvote..<br>\nI dunno if you've picked up my gameplay for the last few games: I've been sick on reaction testing lately. some times I do it more coarsely than others. This one, here, with the vote hopping, quoting myself with nonsense sentences and jumping, flipping 180s, riding a rollercoaster to my ass, well all these are provoking measures. This post - even if it is just one post in all the game - shows me that it was worth being an ass for a while. <br>\n<br>\nYou are right; you are terribly right. My play in this game hasn't been superb - I mean, in certain posts you can definitely see my head crumbing together everything I can and stuff, realy thinking it thorouhgly and investing time and energy, but in others, well, no. this is half reaction testing and half, well, I'm busy.

A good townread on TSO is now welcome on my lap. I still maintain Naio's newtownread from before - nothing's changed and I'm not lynching these two for the while.

I don't understand what you're trying to achieve with your bullshit trolling play. Mindless vote-hopping? What the fuck is this? <br>\n<br>\nAnd I've been reaching out to you the whole game and you don't want to sync with me. I've shown you scum in #431 and #432. I've complained in #379. YOU KNOW FROM EXPERIENCE #369 IS GENUINE. You were in Mala's Medical Mafia with me. It's the exact same situation. You were wrong there, and you're wrong here too. What I'm starting to think is that you know you're wrong but you're not motivated enough to flip your reads on their head. That's what you need to do here. You know when I get into a game I can be useful but you also know when I'm not I'm a terrible, terrible player. You haven't asked me any useful questions, you haven't tried to talk to me, asked for reads, nothing. You're just standing there and getting manipulated and you don't even notice.<br>\n<br>\nYou still have posted NOTHING substantial on me being scummy, you still haven't gone after PinkMittens once, you still haven't done anything. You watched PinkMittens violently sidestep to avoid questions and changed your vote back so fast I'm nearly convinced you were trying to fake paranoia and you're just terrible at doing it. At this stage I'm basically done with you. If you want to actually look Town, if you want to actually contribute, it's time to step up. Otherwise, take a back seat and watch the Town crumble.]</div></div></div></div></blockquote>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5572241#p5572241\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5572241#p5572241\" data-post-id=\"5572241\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 461</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=20887\">T S O</a> wrote:</cite>Now, that's everything before the CoolDog lynch.

More now!<br>\n<br>\nI really don't think you're scum this game. It was little parallels I saw - parallels between this game and Newbie 1450. Like the semi-silly tones in RVS rather than attempting to shorten it, the way you sometimes passive-aggressively nitpick people you're arguing with like for attitude or misspelling your name, and such things like that. But the more I read and think about it I grow more and more sure that these are all just playstyle quirks. Your play is actually much different this game from a scumhunting standpoint. In the aforementioned Newbie you were more apt to tossing questions in every direction and not really following up whereas here you're focusing on one or two people at a time with probing question lines. Yeah. It's funny, actually. I went through the games to solidify my scumread on you and I ended up reading you as town.<br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\nAnyway, TSO?

I can understand seeing his response as townie but I disagree. <br>\n<br>\nIf tool is town, probably Pink based on their agreement on wagoning tool since yesterday (though I'm just as guilty of that).

I guess it's interesting to note I find both of these slots scummy independent of tool, though I'm probably shakier on Jingle since he came in.

The darker a volcanic rock is the more mafic it is. This is due to the higher % of magnesium. A more felsic rock will have almost no magnesium instead having more aluminium and potassium. The silica content is also much much higher in felsic rocks than mafic rocks. The total alkali silica plot below shows tells how mafic or felsic a rock is. Mafic rocks are much less evolved than felsic rocks, the mafic ones are commonly found at sea floor spreading zones like the Mid Atlantic Ridge as basalts and felsic rocks are most commonly found on continental plates in the form of granites (Rhyolite is chemically the same as granite but it is volcanic rather than plutonic).<br>\n</div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"https://www.mafiascum.net/images/img-tags/WHqmmcJgpFcIW9K2vKPW.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:blue\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><br>\n<fieldset style=\"border:3px inset #800000; padding:5px 10px\"><legend style=\"text-transform:uppercase;margin:0 0.6em;padding:0em 0.33em\">Official Vote Count 2.7</legend>TSO (3): PinkMittens, Titus, Kazekirimaru<br>\ntoolenduso (2): Naio, Taylor<br>\nPinkMittens (2): toolenduso, TSO<br>\nshos (1): Jingle<br>\nJacobSavage (1): shos<br>\n<br>\nNot Voting (1):   JacobSavage<br>\n<br>\nWith 10 alive it takes 6 to lynch<br>\n<br>\nV/LA: TSO through TBD<br>\n<br>\nDeadline in <span class=\"countdown\">(expired on 2014-01-10 20:00:00)</span></fieldset><br>\n</div></div>", "time": "Wed Jan 08, 2014 5:23 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=34780&start=675", "forum": "53", "thread": "34780"}

He made some good points regarding then snifit, and seemed to lose interest when he was proven wrong. 601 and 602 were useless to me because I've got a pretty strong townread on Kaze. 607 was a reads list without reasons- incredibly easy and also not really helpful for scumhunting without context. He also gave out townreads like candy in it. His next few posts were promising, if a little vague. His lynch list wasn't something I agree with, but could have lead somewhere. His ETL read was also something that didn't really add much to my ability to read him, but at least seemed like he was trying. 654 is where he gave up, and I don't really see anything at all after that that helps my read. His early attempts at undermining Benmage's townblock were red flags, his snifit reaction (particularly to them becoming conftown) seems town. His ATE is null as fuck. I haven't had the time yet to hyperanalyze the TSO/Pink Mittens back and forth, but when I skimmed I wasn't really convinced by either. This puts him firmly in the I'm not sure pile. If I were more aware of playstyle, I might be able to sort if this bitching from him is town or scum but I can't.<br>\n<br>\nOn the matter of lynchable people (specifically TSO's list) I'm not willing to see a Kaze lynch today. I find myself forgetting most of the specific things Naoi posted, which always scares me, but he seems to be genuinely newbish, so I'm not keen on his lynch today. Titus doesn't want to see a Mittens lynch, and for now I'm content to trust her there. That leaves JS and JS is a damned policy lynch at best. I hate policy lynches, especially on D2.<br>\n<br>\nPEdit: The new lynch list is not better. I'm less willing to lynch me than Naoi obviously. Glad to see TSO hasn't given up on the game though. Now he just needs to make his alignment obvious to me.", "time": "Wed Jan 08, 2014 9:40 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=34780&start=700", "forum": "53", "thread": "34780"}

{"number": 771, "id": "5603310", "user": "PinkMittens", "user_id": "22894", "content": "This flip messed up my entire train of thought, mildly confused right now. I'll also be fairly busy until tuesday. I will be present for short comments and the like, so I guess there's no point in calling v/la, but I won't have time to go over the thread properly or even from the start (which I feel the need to right now).<br>\n<br>\nAnyways, some hungover thoughts: Considering that we have plurality voting, and not really any other options than TSO at the end of the day, I don't think the last few votes \"finishing off\" TSO means that much. Scum could just as easily sit back and let the plurality rule kick in over getting on a wrong wagon. That kinda leaves the people making the wagon swing towards TSO over me. Personally I know that this doesn't make much sense (does put me in a bit of a pickle today, so I guess it makes some sense) for scum either, since it was a town vs town choice for scum. This leaves that scum essentially just could do whatever they think would be more inconspicuous, which well, feels like it could be anything at this stage. Essentially I guess I'm saying that I find it troublesome to get too much information from that wagon, and that I'd like you to be open to the possibility that scum essentially could chose between two town when looking at it. Do people feel like the wagon realistically could turn/grow that quickly without scum getting on it though?<br>\n<br>\nAlso worth noting if you look at the wagon is that jingle essentially was on it (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5589333#p5589333\">628</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5593237#p5593237\">678</a>), just without actually voting, which if anything reads worse to me. Honestly not liking Jingle at all right now, his last few posts D-2 didn't sit well with me. Once I have time I'll look more at him and EK.<br>\n<br>\nNaio NK could be for a few reasons. He did share most of Benmages reads, with the main exception that his primary scum read was Tool. That being said, he wasn't exactly pushing hard for anyone, so leaving him alive wouldn't be a huge threat. More inclined to think that it was to confuse town/not narrow down our options, due to him being fairly active it doesn't give us a huge amount of information, and he was a strong townread in most peoples eyes. The kill itself doesn't tell us that much, but the fact that he was killed over someone who was actively hunting could indicate that scum feels relatively safe at this stage. Titus was also town-reading quite a few players (strongest one being Shos, but also others <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5591343#p5591343\">647</a>), and a conf.towns protection is a fairly good safety-net, so this is definitely something to consider.<br>\n<br>\nNot something I've done before, so I'm asking you: Would mass claim or no lynch-&gt;mass claim be a good option at this stage? Having all the PR's and their result on the table could let us draw some conclusions about the setup and narrow down the lynch pool. I guess the drawback is that subsequent turns become harder (PR's will be killed off), but at this stage it's not even sure that we'll get that far.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">@Mod</div>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5593963#p5593963\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5593963#p5593963\" data-post-id=\"5593963\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 690</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=22894\">PinkMittens</a> wrote:</cite><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">@Mod.

The rocks here show evidence of multiple metamorphic events and are part of a type of rock found through Scotland and Ireland known as the Dalradian metasediments. There appears to be overprinting on the rocks, this is known as cleavage. It is slightly difficult to distinguish between bedding and cleavage in the field but the diagram below shows how this is done. The bedding is the purple and yellow sections and as it is compressed the rocks fold. Cleavage is a type of linear deformation that shows the orientation of the fold axis.

Post #309 building a case on me was bad, but subsequent explanation in #320 helps me feel more like they'd actually put some thought into the case rather than just pulling out a case against a random towny and trying to get them lynched. Reaction to heavy pressure from town (frustration, anger, asking people to read the case) looks towny because it seemed like ETL legitimately believed I was scum and didn't want people to mislynch her. Though I'm sure this would be player-specific, I think scum might just approach the situation by lurking/hopping to a more popular lynch/trying to distract town. But ETL's posts seemed to come from a town mindset. Was on CD wagon, which isn't a good sign, but assuming three scum there were at least four town voting for Cool, so Taylor could have easily been one of them.<br>\n<br>\nNull-scum:<br>\n<br>\nJacob: Lots of lurking, even after site stopped crashing. Very little contribution when he has posted, except to attack kaze and defend Taylor. Has given very little reasoning for reads and never commented on how kaze could be scum despite the wincon thing. Post #775 again makes me think that if either PM or JS is scum, the other is too.<br>\n<br>\nJingle: First player in slot (EK) gave relatively shallow reads and lurked a lot. Slightly scummy from that, but not enough to call scum yet. Jingle's posts have been thoughtful, especially in his case against Shos (#515), but that's pretty null I think. Expressed willingness to lynch TSO if town wouldn't lynch another read, which would appear scummy except that he never actually voted for TSO. Didn't go for low-hanging fruit upon replacing in (first vote was for shos), and demonstrated unwillingness to lynch kaze, which I would think scum wouldn't want to do -- scum could easily come in, see the hesitation some players have expressed about kaze and decide to further muck up the atmosphere. For this reason, if Jingle were to flip scum, I would definitely reconsider kaze's towniness. Jingle's waffling on shos (#713, #722, #767) is scummy because it looks like he's reaching for a reason to lynch him. #767 especially looks scummy because it happened during likely MyLo.<br>\n<br>\nScum:<br>\n<br>\nShos: In #155 calls Naio newbtown, but keeps his vote on him. Overall, very willing to hop around to different votes and to sheep other people's voting. Has voted for a lot of town in the process. #410 is the old \"oh no, town died!\" scumtell. #506 looks like it could be a reason pulled out of thin air to support a vote for no reason. Waffled like crazy on TSO, unvoting and advocating a policy lynch of Jacob instead -- if Jacob is scum, I would bet money that shos isn't. #734 is especially strange because he voted TSO for deadline reasons despite pointing our earlier in the game (#) that we have plurality rules.This could be a way of ensuring that a mislynch would go through rather than a last-second redirect to him or one of his partners. Post #773 comes across like him saying \"I don't want to call hopping on the TSO wagon scummy so I'm going to call tool towny for doing it.\"<br>\n<br>\nPinkMittens: Has been aggressive in asking questions and analyzing other players the whole game. This has looked opportunistic and waffle-y at times (see read on Naio in #76). Weird backing down from push on CD in #92, which later turned into a push against him and then a vote in time for a deadline lynch. Tunneled on TSO for a long time, including massive cases that analyzed (I believe) every single one of his posts up to that point -- this seems townie, but did eventually lead to TSO's lynch, after which he came up VT. Held me at arm's length (see #486) by saying I was scummy while questioning the reasons other people were voting for me -- also looks towny. Defense of Jacob in #689 and subsequent pushes for replacement raise red flags -- if one is scum, I would bet money the other is too. Call for people not to analyze wagon against TSO in #771 is scummy -- she's arguing that people shouldn't try to find scum based on the wagon rather than saying that conclusion x about the wagon is wrong because of argument y. Feels like trying to push people's attention elsewhere/cause confusion. Overall, certain towny-looking actions tell me that in order for PM to be scum, I have to assume she's a good scum player. I could see that being the case based on her overall playstyle -- she seems relatively intelligent/insightful, which would suggest being capable of making a town mindset shine through in certain posts.", "time": "Mon Jan 13, 2014 2:15 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=34780&start=775", "forum": "53", "thread": "34780"}

Combined with me being paranoid about almost everyone during the nights, the fact that me saving a player would yield an extra lynch for town (due to desperado) and that you as conftown was a significantly more likely target than the average townie means that I went with that.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nThoughts regarding Jacobs claim: His play makes no sense as bp, hardcore lurking seems like a very bad way to draw mafia-fire. Not sure if the claim itself is completely impossible (though indeed unlikely), I guess a JK+BP could compensate a bit for the desperado role being prone to pushing mylo a day early. Doing that as scum also seems very strange considering that I just claimed JK, he should've realised that people would be sceptical about the claim. Shos statement that \"he needs a reason for why he isn't dead\" obviously makes no sense considering that we've yet to have a kill negated afaik, what did you mean by that? <br>\n<br>\nThink I'd like to lynch him today, but there's no reason to not discuss it a bit first. You guys who have played more than me, how likely do you feel a BP+JK setup is in a mini normal?
