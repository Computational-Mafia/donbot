You see right now we are sitting at 3/13 players being scum. We have a lynch pool of 13. Tomorrow, if we can't eliminate anyone as conf town, we stand at 3/11. If we have a quick lynch that happen rapidly we can assume that there are scum in that 7 player bandwagon, so the denominator of the fraction gets reduced significantly. 3/7 or 2/7 (assuming one scum stayed off) is greater than 3/11.

I'll give some more thoughts on what's happened in the game tomorrow, not that there's been a lot since my last post, and anything I forget regarding tool.<br><br>Regarding Tool: I didn't think his initial reaction to Taylor (#21) was terribly scummy, but I did think that it was the scummiest we had at that point (well, about the only thing). Hence I decided to start with my vote there to see reactions/get the game going. I didn't really like the reactions I got. His posts didn't feel genuine/forced, defensive and jumped on the first opportunity to direct us elsewhere (Naio, which I think is a scummy/terrible wagon in general). Once the attention started to shift to the Naio wagon (that he started) he made no intentions of analysing/questioning the responses from Naio, he simply left the vote there and stopped posting until it started to lose steam.<br><br>His posts after that are decent to me (#127 feels a little town). That being said, those posts would be very easy to make as scum as well, the questions are obvious/already made elsewhere. When he isn't actively pressured (I don't think he is atm, despite being at L-2) he doesn't really seem to have any incentive of providing content. Most people have been posting quite little in general though, so I guess this doesn't mean too much. I will admit that I don't think the case on tool is far from strong, I'm just not sure if I have a better one atm.<br><br><br>That being said, O wouldn't really mind a wagon on Cool either, not sure which one I find scummier atm. Those are the only two (you would've been the third before this page) I'm fine voting for atm, I feel kinda unable to read TSO and regarding the rest I'm leaning town/null or they simply haven't provided enough content yet. More on that tomorrow."}

BINGO.

I want to tighten this read up with mastin. I really don't like the way he went after naio, who I'm getting gut town feelings from. His statement about naio's 54 coming from scum motivation seems really forced. Whatt's interesting is that snifit's statement following, in 83, seems more from a town mindset of \"well he looks town to me, why don't you see that too\" as opposed to trying to justify the bad things tool has said. i also dont like his quicklynch justification in 103. <br><br>benmage's reads and read progression are really following my own. I cant really see that kind of fluidity coming from scum. the fact that he can read naio (see 122) also tells me he's most likely town. i also really like the fact that he's townhunting. i completely agree with his 142. that's exactly what i do on d1. @ben, i'm a little wary of forcing a town block though, especially one that includes kaze at this time (and the fact that mastin has vouched your awesomeness, i'm willing to trust his read on you). however, i think you may be mistaken in \"confirming\" kaze as town right now. <br><br>TSO: i don't think it's appropriate to say such things (\"If Benmage is scum, Kaze too is scum\") especially pre-flip. your posts have not given me much to work with. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif\" alt=\":neutral:\" title=\"Neutral\"> and then pinkmittens takes the words out of my mouth in 132. nice. your 134 suggests you have experience with ben and kaze. can you elaborate on your theory, please?<br><br>Shos catchup post... *sigh* i always have trouble reading shos and TSO. (shos, i think tool is scum because <span style=\"font-style: italic\">look at his posts, he's clearly scum trying to deflect and look townie</span>. I just watched him do the same thing in my game. this is the same scumTool.)<br><br>damn. nice post gm. based on what i've seen of your scum games, i'm getting awesome town vibes from your 169. <br><br><br>town<br>ben<br>naio<br>gm<br><br>null-town<br>pink mittens<br>snifit<br><br>null:<br>shos<br>tso<br><br>null-scum<br>emerald<br>jsav<br><br>scum<br>kaze<br>tool<br><br>@ben, naio, gm: can we talk about some of my nulls?<br><br>(disclaimer: These are ETL's reads/comments.

He doesn't want people to look at it.

The intended effect is to look like a contributing, leading townie; but the motivation behind it is far from that.

While voting before reasoning isn't, by itself, very scummy, placed with everything else he has done, it's just another piece of supporting evidence. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Kazekirimaru wrote:</cite>What exactly was scummy about his push on Naio? I pushed on him as well, I believe. Was it the timing or...?</div></blockquote><br>Yeah the timing was one factor. Basically, he voted him initially, without any conviction, but the moment someone else showed intentions of pushing for a Naio lynch, he jumped on it. I also didn't like the reasons he gave for pushing Naio at all, (plus the fact that I am town-reading Naio pretty strongly)."}

You are straight up accusing me of doing something I haven't ever done, as either alignment. <br><br>Also, I don't know if you noticed but um.... we're the only vote on you. Why are you freaking out so bad?<br><br>--------<br><br>There is a big difference between being realistic about your reads, and leaving the door open for you to vote, as you did with Naio in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5524434#p5524434\">186</a>.<br><br>--------<br><br>TSO said: \"If Benmage is scum, Kaze too is scum.\" You replied, \"I can dig it. But how would Kaze be scum?\" shos questioned you about it, since if you actually understood what TSO was saying, you wouldn't be asking that question, and then you respond that \"that's not what I meant\". Which is exactly what I said you did. Because that's what you did. I am positing the motivation behind it, which is my prerogative. It is absolutely valid. <br><br>And yes? I stated the FACT that you did not ever explain why you thought Benmage was scum if Kaze was scum. Ever. Despite making such a bold claim.<br><br>---------<br><br>No. You are not understanding. You are distancing yourself from the situation. You are discrediting it. You have consistently called Kaze a townread, yet attempt to discredit why he is a townread. <span class=\"noboldsig\">This kind of inconsistency is what makes me think you are scum.</span><br><br>---------<br><br>The point is, that you are using a single example of meta, and only this single point of information, for a broad, sweeping, strong as fuck townread on Kaze. This is unrealistic and not town-minded. This is confirmation bias coming from scum who knows who is town and who is not.<br><br>---------<br><br>I explained what my impression of your last post was, which is to rush a lynch. That is exactly what I got out of it. Because that's exactly how it sounds. <br><br>---------<br><br>No no no no. You posted that we should lynch BEFORE you posted your reads list. I am reacting to your <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5533790#p5533790\">304</a>. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Taylor wrote:</cite>A townie would take the information they just gained from the flip and results, and re-evaluate their reads, and apply association analysis to the posts up to this point. Tool does not do any of this. Instead he urges us to lynch (and quickly).</div></blockquote><br>You respond by saying you were in the process of doing this, yet you already posted <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5533790#p5533790\">304</a> urging us to lynch. <br><br>That does not hold up. I'm sorry. It just doesn't. <br><br>You say \"so many things you said here pinged my scumdar\" yet you have yet to actually point out what has pinged you, why it pinged you, or why you think it is more likely to come from scum than town. This is not a townie argument. This is scum attempting to turn a case around.<br><br>Your OMGUS vote doesn't help you either... jsyk."}

I've read through the previous stuff as well, but I'll need to go a bit more into detail to get my thoughts sorted (and I'm still fairly busy irl, I apologize).<br><br>Thoughts:<br>Cooldog wagon built very quickly even considering the circumstances (town=easier to lynch+end of the day). Considering that, the fact that we didn't need a majority (plurality) and that people were very easily swayed into voting for it it feels fairly safe to say that we have 1-2 scum on it.<br><br>Think Benmages flip strengthens the town reads on Naio &amp; Kaze slightly, he was such a die-hard defender that keeping him alive would be more beneficial than the slight town gain they (imo) get from killing him. Don\u2019t really think looking at his suspects is worth that much, he wasn\u2019t really scumhunting nearly as much as he was townhunting so I doubt this caused his death (though it could've had an impact). So yeah, liking shos view on it. Think Kaze is overcomplicating it/trying to hammer in that he\u2019s town in #414, this post is in all honesty pretty terrible. If the reason for the kill is that Kaze was a threat, just kill him? It\u2019s not like it\u2019d be easy to push a Kaze lynch today with or without Benmage (and tool definitely isn't in position to do a 180 and push for a Kaze lynch).<br><br>#411. Taylor town-reading me seems off, my D-1 performance is pretty much terrible.<br><br>#417. Reason? Just the same as Kaze? Think that logic is very far-fetched/almost pure wifom.<br><br>#418. A hydra misinterpreting a (to me) pretty obvious post, at best that\u2019s two people not reading through posts properly (which I feel is far easier to do if you first decide on a target, and then look for evidence supporting that) and at worst it\u2019s simply to discredit. Scummy either way. I think I saw a post where someone did this exact thing a few pages back, if that was EK as well this behaviour is very scummy. I'll go take a look.<br>I do agree with the rest of the post though.<br><br>#424. I can definitely see people reading me as scum, but this case might be the worst case I\u2019ve witnessed, why is fairly self-explanatory. Admittedly I don\u2019t think tools previous posts/reads (in both this game and previous ones) have made much sense either, so I can\u2019t be sure if he\u2019s being silly or scum. The fact that the votes on him right now are really bad (not even one decent reason), does make me feel a bit uncomfortable voting him as well.<br><br>Not the right person to call him out on it (pot kettle), but Jacobs lurking is a bit scummy at this point. Flying under the radar entirely, and still making posts (although short) in other threads.<br><br>TSO. His play makes more sense as scum than town (but doesn't really make much sense as either), and he\u2019s being purposely anti-town. Scum will never nk him, and he can't be around for endgame, meaning that he needs to be lynched. Better to do that sooner than later (less info now than later), so I think he's the best lynch right now, just unfortunate is that we didn\u2019t do that yesterday.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: TSO</span>"}

Anyone can simply iso you and see what you tried to do yesterday: first, lynch/discredit a universal townread who got nk'd tonight (benmage, #128-&gt;), tried to lynch another strong townread (kaze, #128-&gt;, #219-&gt;), voted for a confirmed town (snifit, #250-&gt;, #290) and a whole bunch of AtE and self-votes (#56, #306-&gt;).

However I do think someone who purposly puts themselves in these two categories should be lynched, especially if I know that they are capable of doing better than that (which looking at tso past games, he's able to). Simply the fact that they chose to play anti-town is very scummy, since the only valid reason I can think off for doing that is to make themselves harder to read.

Hence I decided to start with my vote there to see reactions/get the game going. I didn't really like the reactions I got. His posts didn't feel genuine/forced, defensive and jumped on the first opportunity to direct us elsewhere (Naio, which I think is a scummy/terrible wagon in general). Once the attention started to shift to the Naio wagon (that he started) he made no intentions of analysing/questioning the responses from Naio, he simply left the vote there and stopped posting until it started to lose steam. His posts after that are decent to me (#127 feels a little town). That being said, those posts would be very easy to make as scum as well, the questions are obvious/already made elsewhere. When he isn't actively pressured (I don't think he is atm, despite being at L-2) he doesn't really seem to have any incentive of providing content. Most people have been posting quite little in general though, so I guess this doesn't mean too much. I will admit that I don't think the case on tool is far from strong, I'm just not sure if I have a better one atm. That being said, O wouldn't really mind a wagon on Cool either, not sure which one I find scummier atm. Those are the only two (you would've been the third before this page) I'm fine voting for atm, I feel kinda unable to read TSO and regarding the rest I'm leaning town/null or they simply haven't provided enough content yet.

Hence I decided to start with my vote there to see reactions/get the game going. I didn't really like the reactions I got. His posts didn't feel genuine/forced, defensive and jumped on the first opportunity to direct us elsewhere (Naio, which I think is a scummy/terrible wagon in general). Once the attention started to shift to the Naio wagon (that he started) he made no intentions of analysing/questioning the responses from Naio, he simply left the vote there and stopped posting until it started to lose steam. His posts after that are decent to me (#127 feels a little town). That being said, those posts would be very easy to make as scum as well, the questions are obvious/already made elsewhere. When he isn't actively pressured (I don't think he is atm, despite being at L-2) he doesn't really seem to have any incentive of providing content. Most people have been posting quite little in general though, so I guess this doesn't mean too much. I will admit that I don't think the case on tool is far from strong, I'm just not sure if I have a better one atm. That being said, O wouldn't really mind a wagon on Cool either, not sure which one I find scummier atm. Those are the only two (you would've been the third before this page) I'm fine voting for atm, I feel kinda unable to read TSO and regarding the rest I'm leaning town/null or they simply haven't provided enough content yet.

I'm not sure who I was last voting(you'll get it soon TSO no worries) but in case it was you, unvote..<br>I dunno if you've picked up my gameplay for the last few games: I've been sick on reaction testing lately. some times I do it more coarsely than others. This one, here, with the vote hopping, quoting myself with nonsense sentences and jumping, flipping 180s, riding a rollercoaster to my ass, well all these are provoking measures. This post - even if it is just one post in all the game - shows me that it was worth being an ass for a while. <br><br>You are right; you are terribly right. My play in this game hasn't been superb - I mean, in certain posts you can definitely see my head crumbing together everything I can and stuff, realy thinking it thorouhgly and investing time and energy, but in others, well, no. this is half reaction testing and half, well, I'm busy.

A good townread on TSO is now welcome on my lap. I still maintain Naio's newtownread from before - nothing's changed and I'm not lynching these two for the while.

It\u2019s fairly obvious that this simply is a misrep. Snifit hasn\u2019t been terribly active, but he\u2019s been putting out more content than TSO so far, and even has an original case on him in #150. So, what could the actual reason be for jumping Snifit? Oh yeah, Snifit was going after TSO.<br> <br>The discussion between Snifit and TSO then goes back and forth and concludes in:<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5531326#p5531326\" class=\"postlink\">post 253</a>, snifit wrote:</cite>You could only think that if you think I'm asking specific people specific questions at random.

You don't go looking for scumreads, you just decide that anyone who scumreads you is scum. The only thing you care about is staying alive."}

More now!<br><br>I really don't think you're scum this game. It was little parallels I saw - parallels between this game and Newbie 1450.

But the more I read and think about it I grow more and more sure that these are all just playstyle quirks. Your play is actually much different this game from a scumhunting standpoint. In the aforementioned Newbie you were more apt to tossing questions in every direction and not really following up whereas here you're focusing on one or two people at a time with probing question lines. Yeah. It's funny, actually. I went through the games to solidify my scumread on you and I ended up reading you as town.<br><br>---<br><br>Anyway, TSO?

I guess it's interesting to note I find both of these slots scummy independent of tool, though I'm probably shakier on Jingle since he came in. I haven't yet figured out EK's motivation yet and honestly,  not because I didn't want to I just haven't yet.

He throws out this possibility, unlikely as it may be, because he doesn't want town to skip over a potential scum player.<span style=\"font-style: italic\"><br>TSO being asked/pressured into responding to questions, yeah I don't exactly see that happening. The scenario he paints isn't possible. There's a clear difference between a townie not being sure of his town read, and TSO spending most of his time in the game to play down his (at that stage) only town read. Very convenient that he then flips entirely regarding the read, for very vauge reasons.</span><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5587806#p5587806\" class=\"postlink\">post 568</a>, PinkMittens wrote:</cite>He then proceeds to keep voting Snifit once he becomes conf.town (#290), without even being clear on what the Desperado role actually does.

I'm not saying that this paragraph is terribly scummy/that you necessarily are PR fishing (though I can see the possibility), but I did get curious how you came to that conclusion, and what your motivation behind it was.

The silica content is also much much higher in felsic rocks than mafic rocks. The total alkali silica plot below shows tells how mafic or felsic a rock is.

Kaze seems to be waffling on the conftown. I'm frankly confused as fuck.<br><br>TSO's biggest contributions to the game so far have been post 458 and his snifit interactions early D1. He made some good points regarding then snifit, and seemed to lose interest when he was proven wrong. 601 and 602 were useless to me because I've got a pretty strong townread on Kaze. 607 was a reads list without reasons- incredibly easy and also not really helpful for scumhunting without context. He also gave out townreads like candy in it. His next few posts were promising, if a little vague. His lynch list wasn't something I agree with, but could have lead somewhere. His ETL read was also something that didn't really add much to my ability to read him, but at least seemed like he was trying. 654 is where he gave up, and I don't really see anything at all after that that helps my read. His early attempts at undermining Benmage's townblock were red flags, his snifit reaction (particularly to them becoming conftown) seems town. His ATE is null as fuck. I haven't had the time yet to hyperanalyze the TSO/Pink Mittens back and forth, but when I skimmed I wasn't really convinced by either. This puts him firmly in the I'm not sure pile. If I were more aware of playstyle, I might be able to sort if this bitching from him is town or scum but I can't.<br><br>On the matter of lynchable people (specifically TSO's list) I'm not willing to see a Kaze lynch today. I find myself forgetting most of the specific things Naoi posted, which always scares me, but he seems to be genuinely newbish, so I'm not keen on his lynch today. Titus doesn't want to see a Mittens lynch, and for now I'm content to trust her there. That leaves JS and JS is a damned policy lynch at best. I hate policy lynches, especially on D2.<br><br>PEdit: The new lynch list is not better. I'm less willing to lynch me than Naoi obviously. Glad to see TSO hasn't given up on the game though. Now he just needs to make his alignment obvious to me."}

I'll also be fairly busy until tuesday. I will be present for short comments and the like, so I guess there's no point in calling v/la, but I won't have time to go over the thread properly or even from the start (which I feel the need to right now).<br><br>Anyways, some hungover thoughts: Considering that we have plurality voting, and not really any other options than TSO at the end of the day, I don't think the last few votes \"finishing off\" TSO means that much. Scum could just as easily sit back and let the plurality rule kick in over getting on a wrong wagon. That kinda leaves the people making the wagon swing towards TSO over me. Personally I know that this doesn't make much sense (does put me in a bit of a pickle today, so I guess it makes some sense) for scum either, since it was a town vs town choice for scum. This leaves that scum essentially just could do whatever they think would be more inconspicuous, which well, feels like it could be anything at this stage. Essentially I guess I'm saying that I find it troublesome to get too much information from that wagon, and that I'd like you to be open to the possibility that scum essentially could chose between two town when looking at it. Do people feel like the wagon realistically could turn/grow that quickly without scum getting on it though?<br><br>Also worth noting if you look at the wagon is that jingle essentially was on it (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5589333#p5589333\">628</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5593237#p5593237\">678</a>), just without actually voting, which if anything reads worse to me. Honestly not liking Jingle at all right now, his last few posts D-2 didn't sit well with me. Once I have time I'll look more at him and EK.<br><br>Naio NK could be for a few reasons. He did share most of Benmages reads, with the main exception that his primary scum read was Tool. That being said, he wasn't exactly pushing hard for anyone, so leaving him alive wouldn't be a huge threat. More inclined to think that it was to confuse town/not narrow down our options, due to him being fairly active it doesn't give us a huge amount of information, and he was a strong townread in most peoples eyes. The kill itself doesn't tell us that much, but the fact that he was killed over someone who was actively hunting could indicate that scum feels relatively safe at this stage. Titus was also town-reading quite a few players (strongest one being Shos, but also others <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5591343#p5591343\">647</a>), and a conf.towns protection is a fairly good safety-net, so this is definitely something to consider.<br><br>Not something I've done before, so I'm asking you: Would mass claim or no lynch-&gt;mass claim be a good option at this stage? Having all the PR's and their result on the table could let us draw some conclusions about the setup and narrow down the lynch pool. I guess the drawback is that subsequent turns become harder (PR's will be killed off), but at this stage it's not even sure that we'll get that far.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">@Mod</span><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5593963#p5593963\" class=\"postlink\">post 690</a>, PinkMittens wrote:</cite><span class=\"noboldsig\">@Mod.

Post #309 building a case on me was bad, but subsequent explanation in #320 helps me feel more like they'd actually put some thought into the case rather than just pulling out a case against a random towny and trying to get them lynched. Reaction to heavy pressure from town (frustration, anger, asking people to read the case) looks towny because it seemed like ETL legitimately believed I was scum and didn't want people to mislynch her. Though I'm sure this would be player-specific, I think scum might just approach the situation by lurking/hopping to a more popular lynch/trying to distract town. But ETL's posts seemed to come from a town mindset. Was on CD wagon, which isn't a good sign, but assuming three scum there were at least four town voting for Cool, so Taylor could have easily been one of them.<br><br>Null-scum:<br><br>Jacob: Lots of lurking, even after site stopped crashing. Very little contribution when he has posted, except to attack kaze and defend Taylor. Has given very little reasoning for reads and never commented on how kaze could be scum despite the wincon thing. Post #775 again makes me think that if either PM or JS is scum, the other is too.<br><br>Jingle: First player in slot (EK) gave relatively shallow reads and lurked a lot. Slightly scummy from that, but not enough to call scum yet. Jingle's posts have been thoughtful, especially in his case against Shos (#515), but that's pretty null I think. Expressed willingness to lynch TSO if town wouldn't lynch another read, which would appear scummy except that he never actually voted for TSO. Didn't go for low-hanging fruit upon replacing in (first vote was for shos), and demonstrated unwillingness to lynch kaze, which I would think scum wouldn't want to do -- scum could easily come in, see the hesitation some players have expressed about kaze and decide to further muck up the atmosphere. For this reason, if Jingle were to flip scum, I would definitely reconsider kaze's towniness. Jingle's waffling on shos (#713, #722, #767) is scummy because it looks like he's reaching for a reason to lynch him. #767 especially looks scummy because it happened during likely MyLo.<br><br>Scum:<br><br>Shos: In #155 calls Naio newbtown, but keeps his vote on him. Overall, very willing to hop around to different votes and to sheep other people's voting. Has voted for a lot of town in the process. #410 is the old \"oh no, town died!\" scumtell. #506 looks like it could be a reason pulled out of thin air to support a vote for no reason. Waffled like crazy on TSO, unvoting and advocating a policy lynch of Jacob instead -- if Jacob is scum, I would bet money that shos isn't. #734 is especially strange because he voted TSO for deadline reasons despite pointing our earlier in the game (#) that we have plurality rules.This could be a way of ensuring that a mislynch would go through rather than a last-second redirect to him or one of his partners. Post #773 comes across like him saying \"I don't want to call hopping on the TSO wagon scummy so I'm going to call tool towny for doing it.\"<br><br>PinkMittens: Has been aggressive in asking questions and analyzing other players the whole game. This has looked opportunistic and waffle-y at times (see read on Naio in #76). Weird backing down from push on CD in #92, which later turned into a push against him and then a vote in time for a deadline lynch. Tunneled on TSO for a long time, including massive cases that analyzed (I believe) every single one of his posts up to that point -- this seems townie, but did eventually lead to TSO's lynch, after which he came up VT. Held me at arm's length (see #486) by saying I was scummy while questioning the reasons other people were voting for me -- also looks towny. Defense of Jacob in #689 and subsequent pushes for replacement raise red flags -- if one is scum, I would bet money the other is too. Call for people not to analyze wagon against TSO in #771 is scummy -- she's arguing that people shouldn't try to find scum based on the wagon rather than saying that conclusion x about the wagon is wrong because of argument y. Feels like trying to push people's attention elsewhere/cause confusion. Overall, certain towny-looking actions tell me that in order for PM to be scum, I have to assume she's a good scum player. I could see that being the case based on her overall playstyle -- she seems relatively intelligent/insightful, which would suggest being capable of making a town mindset shine through in certain posts."}

Combined with me being paranoid about almost everyone during the nights, the fact that me saving a player would yield an extra lynch for town (due to desperado) and that you as conftown was a significantly more likely target than the average townie means that I went with that.<br><br><br>Thoughts regarding Jacobs claim: His play makes no sense as bp, hardcore lurking seems like a very bad way to draw mafia-fire. Not sure if the claim itself is completely impossible (though indeed unlikely), I guess a JK+BP could compensate a bit for the desperado role being prone to pushing mylo a day early. Doing that as scum also seems very strange considering that I just claimed JK, he should've realised that people would be sceptical about the claim. Shos statement that \"he needs a reason for why he isn't dead\" obviously makes no sense considering that we've yet to have a kill negated afaik, what did you mean by that? <br><br>Think I'd like to lynch him today, but there's no reason to not discuss it a bit first. You guys who have played more than me, how likely do you feel a BP+JK setup is in a mini normal? Do you think a desperado could warrant that?"}

Add in the fact that I've been beat to shit by the past few games (and some people in those games), I'm not exactly all about being the best scum hunter ever. <br><br>If he's town, then he'll figure it out from the state of my perception about mafia site-wide by looking into it himself, if he's actually interested in figuring me out. If he's scum, then it doesn't matter since he's just using false meta as a justification for his vote.<br><br>Either way, it doesn't really matter."}

It's something I'm cautiously optimistic about, but I do think I'm heading out of months worth of depression at last. Everything in my life is feeling balanced. (I juggle 3-6 \"identities\" depending on your definition--three critical, three secondary. While the secondary ones aren't as good, the primary ones, I've never felt more in control of.) Obviously I need to be careful and not let myself get back into that rut, but a little scheduling, prioritizing, and support has made me feel like I've actually got the hold on my life I was losing.<br><br>Thus, why I'm bummed out I didn't get to show it this game. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\">"}
