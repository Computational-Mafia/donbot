In particular, no discussion of ongoing games is allowed.<br>2) No discussion of this game allowed anywhere outside this game thread (which includes PMs), unless otherwise stated by your Role PM.<br>3) <span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #F04040\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">My Mod color is (#F04040). Do not use it.</span></span></span><br>4) Do not quote your Role PM or any other PMs from the Mod, real or fabricated.<br>5) Play to your win condition. Do not claim scum with another player regardless of your alignment, there will be consequences.<br>6) No personal attacks.<br>7) Do not edit or delete your post, even if you have the ability to do so.<br>8) No using encrypted text, small text, bright-coloured text, or otherwise make it hard to see what you are writing.<br>9) Use common sense. There are probably many other rules but I forgot about them. If it feels wrong, please don't do it. If in doubt, contact the Mod.<br>10) Expressing intent to break a rule, fake breaking a rule, finding loopholes in a rule or encouraging someone to break a rule is equivalent to breaking the rule itself and will suffer similar consequences.<br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">11) Questions relating to roles, either yours, or someone else's or imaginary, will not be entertained in the game thread. If you have a question regarding roles, you have to ask me by PM and it won't be answered in the game thread.<br></span><br><br><span style=\"font-size: 140%; line-height: 116%;\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Voting and Lynching rules:</span></span><br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">1) Day phases will last 8 days.</span><br>2) Night phases last exactly 2 days (48 hours)<br>3) Use either bold tags or vote tags to vote someone. It is preferable if you vote at the start of a line.<br>For example : <br><span class=\"noboldsig\">VOTE : chilledtea</span> <dl class=\"codebox\"><dt>Code: <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"selectCode(this); return false;\">Select all</a></dt><dd><code>[b]VOTE : chilledtea[/b]</code></dd></dl><br>or<br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: chilledtea</span> <dl class=\"codebox\"><dt>Code: <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"selectCode(this); return false;\">Select all</a></dt><dd><code>[v]VOTE : chilledtea[/v]</code></dd></dl><br>4) Votes to No Lynch are accepted, indicated by <span class=\"noboldsig\">VOTE: No Lynch</span> or <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: No Lynch</span>.<br>5) To unvote, use the unvote tag (<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: </span>) or bold (<span class=\"noboldsig\">UNVOTE : </span>), but I'll accept <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Unvote</span> as well.<br>6) Votes in quote tags will not be counted. Please do not put votes in any other tags, they will not be counted either.<br>7) It takes a strict majority (half of all players plus 1, rounded down) to achieve a lynch. It takes a weak majority (half of all players, rounded up) to No Lynch.<br>8) If a majority was not met by deadline, a No Lynch will happen.<br>9) When a lynch has been achieved, it is final, and any further votes or unvotes will not count. Everyone (including the lynched person) may continue to post until I post the lynch scene.<br>10) When you are dead, do not post, game related or not. This means no \u2018bah' posts.<br>11) If the Mod has made an error in the vote count, please post the error in thread.<br><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"font-size: 140%; line-height: 116%;\">Activity and Replacements:</span></span><br><br>1) 48 hours without a post will incur a prod.<br>2) If you do not respond to the prod by posting in the main thread within 24 hours, you will be replaced.<br>3) Three prods and I will also replace you.<br>4) If a replacement happens near deadline, I may grant an extension. I reserve the right not to give this extension if I feel it's being abused.<br>5) If a replacement happens at Night, I will freeze the deadline until a replacement is found.<br><br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"font-size: 140%; line-height: 116%;\">Setup Information:<br></span></span><br>1) This is a 13 player Normal closed setup. It follows the Normal game guidelines.<br>2) It is also guaranteed that at least one player is a Vanilla Townie, who will receive the role PM as shown below.<br>3) Natural Action Resolution is in effect.<br>4) Please submit Night actions on time. Overdue Night actions will not count, even if I haven't resolved them yet.<br>5) If you believe the Mod has made an error in resolving effects, please PM me.<br>6) A mafia member can only carry out his faction kill, or his individual ability, but not both.<br>7) Mafia do not have the ability to privately communicate during the day, except via the means of a power role. <br><br><span style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;\">Sample Role PM</span> :<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: </b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display: none;\">Welcome to Mini Normal 1829!<br>You are a <span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #208000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Vanilla Town</span></span></span>.<br>You get to vote for a lynch every day phase in which you are alive.<br>You win when all threats to the town have been eliminated and at least one town member is alive.<br>Game Thread - <!-- l --><a class=\"postlink-local\" href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=68243\">viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=68243</a><!-- l --></div></div></div>"}

If you look at my suggestions for what Blitz could have discussed in <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8306693#p8306693\" class=\"postlink\">post #16</a>, you'll see that what I suggest is game related, not a joke. A joke reason is only marginally better then no reason at all, and far worse then an actual game related reason. I believe that the main goal of the early game is to get discussion started, so that we have interactions on which we can build reads. The AVS originally developed with the idea that the arbitrary votes would give players something to respond to. However, it's now been used so long by players who have no clue why it's there that it's become essentially useless in that regard. So I will make sure players have plenty of reason to respond to my AVS votes, and I will criticize those who don't give us anything to respond to.<br><br>@Maria: There is no such thing as a random voting stage. There are early arbitrary votes to get discussion started, but once discussion has started there's no reason to vote randomly. Your vote isn't currently accomplishing anything and could be far more useful elsewhere.<br><br>Also:<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8308694#p8308694\" class=\"postlink\">post 80</a>, Blitzkrieg wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8308659#p8308659\" class=\"postlink\">post 78</a>, MariaR wrote:</cite>Where the F did I say \"I want to stay in RVS stage!\" I'm saying we're still in it <br><br>Michael's first posts have been a load of bs and feels like <span class=\"noboldsig\">he's trying to get something rolling on town (ironic cause I'm doing the same thing)</span><br><br>Jarjar made one post and it wasn't a joking post it was a chainsaw lynch post that was god awful</div></blockquote><br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: MariaR</span><br><br>Explain the bolded.</div></blockquote><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: MariaR</span>"}

I was coming around to the idea of a kranka/shadow/kanos team. Would Trancend, as scum, put that much heat on himself? I actully think I rather lynch someone else today. Gerry can policy vig that.</div></blockquote>@Nero: I would argue that Transcend, as scum, would try the mason fakeclaim whenever he felt he could get away with it. If it works he has made himself essentially unlynchable for the first couple of days, while also buddying up to Maria. There's huge payoff there. The heat his actions generate seem more detrimental to town then to scum as well. From his perspective, if he is town who is trying to defend a townread, he risks two mislynches instead of just one if the plan backfires. Whereas if he's scum fakeclaiming with Maria town, his lynch could easily be followed by a Maria mislynch push from his buddies afterwards.<br><br>The mason fakeclaim is something he would always do as scum, and not nearly as much as town. As such, it is far scummier then anything else that happened in the thread thus far. No reason to leave the situation to other players, do what you can do: vote Transcend.<br><br>@Maria: If you're interested in the thoughts regarding game balance on mafiascum, you may want to read <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;t=67307\" class=\"postlink\">this</a> or <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;t=67596\" class=\"postlink\">this</a> thread in mafia discussion.

It outs powerroles, makes reliable setup speculation completely impossible, and causes town to act on bad information. Each of those is a recipe of mislynches. On the other hand, fakeclaiming is extremely good for scum: it causes confusion, and in some cases allows scum a plausible excuse for their behaviour. Fakeclaiming is something scum does 100% of the time, because they cannot afford to claim truthfully. So you have an action that scum will do 100% of the time, and town shouldn't do ever. That makes fakeclaiming one of the biggest scumtells there is.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8314670#p8314670\" class=\"postlink\">post 673</a>, Thor665 wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8314600#p8314600\" class=\"postlink\">post 652</a>, MichelSableheart wrote:</cite> I'm particularly townreading blitzkrieg, Thor and you, with more doubts about JJD, Elyse and Nero.</div></blockquote><br>I would easily and happily argue that JarJar and Nero are both blatantly better townreads than Blitz (or IAI for that matter).<br>Why are you conflicted on those two?</div></blockquote>Conflicted is the wrong word.

You would be actively making others more suspicious of your townread, making his lynch more likely. And there's no guarantee whatsoever that the townslip you're hoping for will happen. On the other hand, scum wants to wagon someone they know is town. So that's an action scum is extremely likely to do, and town is extremely unlikely to do. But that has been explained to you before."}

I think that voting without giving reasoning is better for scum then for town, as it does nothing to get discussion started. This made Blitz slightly more likely to be scum, but the difference was marginal. If the other players had a 3 in 12 chance (0.25) of being scum, I felt her chance of being scum was something like 0.2505. Marginally higher, not strong at all, but if I have to vote during AVS to get discussion started anyway, I might as well vote for something that might be indicative of scum.<br><br>As for why I didn't say \"oh hey I wanted to start the game\"? Doing so would have shut down the discussion we had going.

If he's town, he wouldn't do this all the time. He wouldn't do this if he felt his townread on maria wasn't strong enough. He wouldn't do it if he felt he had other ways to safe her.

I looked through Elyse's ISO and that's essentially the impression I got. If that's so, then I can understand the logic behind the scumread at the very least, even though I know it comes to the wrong conclusion. I think Thor, due to mutual [ongoing] experience with Transcend, can at least agree with me that Transcend is an... interesting player who would do something stupid like that as town. Plus, I think someone mentioned that EM's meta is more gambity, and knowing Transcend's playstyle from there (he pestered me to play there a few times, wasn't fond of it) this really does not come as a surprise. I can't really justify Transcend's thought process and I'm not really going to try, but this seems like typical Transcend to me.<br><br>There also seems to be a recurring belief that one of {Me, Maria} is mafia, but at the moment I'm townreading Maria so this thought process seems kind of weird to me. I can understand scum!Me/town!Maria and obviously town!Me/town!Maria, but I'm not exactly getting town!Me/scum!Maria.

In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8309703#p8309703\">156</a>, you say that because you lost against scum!Maria that you would expect her to make a better play. But even if Maria played a good scumgame, that doesn't say anything about her towngame. With my experience with scum!Maria, she was widely townread because her scumbuddies tried to play up the fact she looked like newbtown. If you have to play up the newbie card to get townread, then I don't really expect your towngame to look that great. Also, take a look at Maria's meta. Most of her games are scumgames, she has far more experience playing it and I don't think she's lost a single game. My point is that just because Maria can <span style=\"font-style: italic\">act</span> like town doesn't mean she's actually good at <span style=\"font-style: italic\">being</span> town. They're two entirely different skillsets to me.<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8309719#p8309719\">165</a> also feels like you're keeping your options open. At this point in your ISO, it looks like you have 3 scumreads that are somewhat strong. That seems like a lot for that point in time, especially considering that you haven't said you townread anyone. You're scumreading Maria because you think she's skilled and overreacting? That seems like a really surface-level read to me, and it doesn't really help that it was the most popular wagon at the time.<br><br>Also noting that in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8310060#p8310060\">246</a> that you said that Maria was more likely to be scum between the two of us for future reference.<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8310614#p8310614\">416</a> sucks. If you don't believe a mason claim and have fake-claimed mason before with someone, why the hell are you unvoting? It reads to me that you're trying to play it safe as scum, because you pushing a lynch on a claimed mason that actually flips mason would look terrible for you.<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8312167#p8312167\">455</a>... JJD at least reads townier to me, but I still don't understand how defending townreads is scummy. There also weren't really any points for Kraska to respond to, Thor didn't make any points (you say in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8312300#p8312300\">459</a> he did), and JJD's case was weak and Kraska's response to it was completely valid. Again, this reads to me like you're finding easy reasons to scumread people and following what other people are thinking. Honestly the fact that 459 is a non-answer to Kraska's request kinda proves that... Not answering that and admitting to sheeping pretty much stops Kraska from getting any chance to sort you early-game because you take away her chance of understanding your mindset <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif\" alt=\":?\" title=\"Confused\"><br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8312304#p8312304\">460</a>, how is Kraska saying that Maria's actions don't make sense from a scum mindset not a valid reason to townread someone? Plus your premise here is kind of faulty, Maria shouldn't give a shit about how people are reading her if she's town. And <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8312306#p8312306\">461</a> is unnecessary shit throwing at Kraska, referring to someone as a \"mislynch\" isn't a scumslip and I don't understand why I keep seeing people come to that conclusion.<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8312314#p8312314\">462</a> also really feels like you're contradicting your vote. Fine, you think Maria is scummy because of her claim, I think that's a valid perspective. But what townie thinks, \"My two scumreads have claimed masons together and I don't believe their claim at all. Voting for them is a terrible idea though because the claim might be true\"? If you think the claim is bullshit, then you don't dance around it and egg other people into voting for the people claiming. Especially because I've seen scum do stuff like that before (best example i have is ongoing sadly. truly the woe of being a newbie), this doesn't look like townie thinking to me.<br><br>Noting a townread on karnos in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8312351#p8312351\">470</a> for what is essentially agreeing with everyone else.<br><br>Are you still scumreading Thor from <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8313044#p8313044\">509</a>? I don't like the implication that people who disagree with you or scumread you are scum and that's the one I'm getting here.<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8313066#p8313066\">511</a> really reinforces that your way of approaching the mason fakeclaim is scummy as shit. You've been telling other people that the mason claim looked fake to you, yet you're acting like you think it's actually real. This looks like doublethink to me. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8313808#p8313808\">597</a> is pretty bad for the same reasons, especially not fond of the discredit of scumreads on you.<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8313835#p8313835\">607</a>, Michel is suddenly town because he agrees with the premise you've been pushing but never acting on... Hm.<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8313876#p8313876\">623</a> is just <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_arrow_up.gif\" alt=\":up:\" title=\"Up Arrow\">... So, earlier in the game, scum!Maria is trying to butter up town!Transcend by early townreading him and their dynamic is weird. But now, conveniently right after Michel votes for Transcend, your opinion reverses. If anything, I think sticking your neck out and risking the safety of the town to defend a townread is more likely to come from town than it is from scum. So, what exactly is it that made you change your opinion? There's nothing in your ISO that makes me think that you would want to vote for Transcend beforehand, and most of your posts suggest that you found Maria scummier even post-mason claim. What made you change your opinion?<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8313882#p8313882\">625</a>... I hate to inform you of this but Transcend isn't... exactly the brightest bulb I know...<br><br>Is it normal for you as town to make posts like <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8314059#p8314059\">637</a> and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8312314#p8312314\">462</a>? I agree Maria's reasoning isn't that great but this is just a really icky way to approach it.<br><br>Sidenote, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8315405#p8315405\">701</a> is a good post.<br><br>Karnos is being shitty in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8315424#p8315424\">704</a>, but especially with what Karnos says in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8314726#p8314726\">677</a> (essentially the idea that transcend is just being a shit like he always is), this feels more like you criticizing him for not wanting to vote Transcend, especially because you liked him for town earlier for thinking the masons were fakeclaiming.<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8315457#p8315457\">710</a> sits strangely with me. Isn't your scumread of Transcend based on the fact you think he's being manipulative with his mason claim? Yet, at the same time, you're scumreading Maria... I get that pre-flip associations are bad and I agree, but your reads don't make sense without knowing one of our alignments for sure. If anything, this feels like you're lining up mislynches.<br><br>I don't get <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8317281#p8317281\">873</a>.

It feels like by saying that \"Transcend [was] not town\" that A: You thought <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8318520#p8318520\">1032</a> was a town post, B: You're conflating pro-town and town-aligned, and C: That Transcend and I could have different alignments. Seems to me that that's coming from someone who already knew that Transcend's slot was town.<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8319436#p8319436\">1050</a> is like... textbook lining up mislynches. If I'm lynched, I want Maria and Kraska completely ignored and for other slots to be pressured because I think this town's tunnel vision on my slot and Maria's is going to shit up town's chances of winning. Encouraging that is pretty much the scummiest thing that has happened in this game, honestly.<br><br>Also, on <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8320871#p8320871\">1073</a>, the fact that you want to throw shit at me because you think my Ascetic claim is scummy must be unreal. There's probably an investigative role in this game, meaning that my claim should be provable. If I'm <span style=\"font-style: italic\">lying</span> about being Ascetic, then if someone decides to test out my claim, I'm toast. Scum!me, btw, doesn't fakeclaim <span style=\"font-style: italic\">ascetic</span> as a \"just in case\" sort of thing because that requires me to have a buddy who can roleblock and for them to be able to get a perfect PR read and block them for the entire game... That's assuming only one person can confirm my claim. <br><br>And, from personal experience, truthfully claiming Ascetic as scum is a shit idea because it takes away the role's utility in removing an investigation from a town player. I would have expected someone more experienced to know this, but whatever. Can you link me a game where scum has outright claimed they are ascetic? I don't think it's a thing that happens. Also, the fact that Transcend <span style=\"font-style: italic\">didn't</span> claim this should actually be working in my favor, because it makes it more likely, from everyone else's POV, that I'm telling the truth. If Transcend were scum and ascetic, I wouldn't want to reveal his way of hindering town's power at night if he didn't claim it early on, especially if I felt confident in being able to move momentum away from me.<br><br>If anything, the fact I'm ascetic is part of why I'm OK with being lynched. I still think that people are going to go after Maria or Kraska next, which is an awful idea, but at least there isn't ambiguity around my claim and it can't be used to stir paranoia around my slot.<br><br>Plus, it's miller claims that scum make \"just in case\". Claiming ascetic for the same reason is stupid.</div></div></div>"}

I'm willing to accept that he fakeclaims as town some of the time, perhaps even a lot of the time, but there must be situations where he, as town, realizes fakeclaiming in that particular situation is a bad idea. Perhaps he feels that particular read isn't strong enough to fakeclaim for it. Perhaps he feels that something other then fakeclaiming works better. There will be situations where he's trueclaiming and therefore won't retract his claim.<br><br>Yet because players like you won't lynch him over it, he knows he can get away with fakeclaiming as scum. Which means he will indeed fakeclaim as scum to his hearts content, whenever he sees the opportunity.<br><br>All this means that even from him, a fakeclaim is more likely to come from scum then it is from town. So why are you letting him get away with his scum fakeclaims?<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>giga wrote:</cite>So I'm on page 20 right now and I have to ask people's opinions on something: The mason claim was pretty obviously a load of bs-ass bullshit and people discussed why.

Is this more of a site meta thing where the claim is just assumed to be true? This might just be hindsight bias from knowing the claim is obviously fake but I feel like there should be a vote in this post. </div></blockquote>Town fakeclaiming is something that in my experience (4 years out of date, admittedly) never happened. So when two players claimed mason together, I felt it was either scum+scum or mason+mason. Given that, accidentally suspecting one of our strongest powerroles felt far more likely then two scum risking everything on an early day 1 gambit.

I have to agree with giga's assessment that your vote was on a vanity wagon there.<br><br>Also, where the ... did that karnos vote come from? You didn't mention him at all before maria suggested him.

Just keeping up with one game takes up all the time I have available for Mafiascum. I read mafia discussion a bit, but the \"how much have things shifted\" thread didn't mention anything about an increase in town fakeclaims. But even if town fakeclaims have become more prevalent, I see no reason to consider a fakeclaim as anything other then a huge scumtell.

Based on a few of the scumgames of Maria I've looked at, her attitude seems to vary greatly based on its playerlist. For example, <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8235823&amp;user_select%5B%5D=28112#p8235823\" class=\"postlink\">in Mini 1823</a> with a town!Transcend and gerry, her ISO doesn't read as awkwardly as this one does, and her tone is aggressive and jokey. I think this came from the fact that she was familiar with the playerlist and feels comfortable playing with them and manipulating them. It probably worked too, she pretty much obvscummed the whole game and survived until endgame somehow. Versus <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=51&amp;t=67549\" class=\"postlink\">my actual experience with scum!Maria</a>, she played up the newbie card and had a very awkward approach to playing the game, probably because she actually was nervous and didn't know anyone. Hell, while skimming Machiavellian Mafia while it was ongoing (but post Maria flip in 649), I thought Maria was <span style=\"font-style: italic\">town</span> because she was acting so differently. While looking for more examples to support this theory of mine too, I came across this quote from another player who I also think picked up on this during a 3p LYLO where Maria was, in fact, scum:<br><br><div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:1px;\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Spoiler: </b> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Show\" class=\"button2\" onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }\"></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"><div style=\"display: none;\"><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8318176#p8318176\" class=\"postlink\">post 2572</a>, Vedith wrote:</cite>I think her meta depends on the players she's with, and uses what those players said as town in previous games as her playing field.<br>Last scum game I was with her (I think I already put this?) she had 2 friends in and seemed more confident in just shouting the entire game, because both of her friends normally town read her for that.<br>In the game where she was scum with KTS and Zach, I think she was more mellow on the scum sided and just played on her innocence because she wasn't in as much of a comfort zone as she was with Gerry and Trans.<br>Originally I felt that she was ready to shout towards me as she might be getting slightly more conftable considering we are in a few games together, but then as we were just scumming it together at the time, she quickly backed off, possibly so my alarm bells didn't go off.<br>I thought I was just thinking too much into it and decided to ignore it.<br><br>Here she seems to be trying more in an innocence kind of play as she doesn't have her friends in here to read up for shouting.<br><br>I'm not confident enough on Maria's meta to go by that purely (hence the retraction on day 3) as I haven't played with her as town yet (or confirmed town, at least). <br>However, going by how she acted with Trans and Gerry (and Trans calling her town for it), her town game is being stubborn, loud and a lot more forceful... Again, this could be a comfort thing on personality rather than meta.</div></blockquote></div></div></div><br><br>So, the fact that I know that Transcend is town and me seeing Maria react really poorly to pressure makes me think that this is how she naturally is as town... Scum!her would probably actually try to pocket Transcend again because it almost always works for her and can probably bluff better under pressure from her wagon. The fact that she has <span style=\"font-style: italic\">some</span> degree of confidence also support this for me.<br><br>What made my read waver though is all of this confusing shit she's pulling with Elyse and the fact that I don't think Maria has really done anything townie.

So, I <span style=\"font-style: italic\">like</span> the tinfoil theory that Maria is town because of the group dynamic but I can compromise on her at this point if the Elyse wagon is dismantled entirely because Maria hasn't really done anything that's made me feel good about townreading her.<br><br><div align=\"center\"><hr style=\"height:14px; width:50%\"></div><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>kraska77 wrote:</cite>I think I'm gonna re-read the game Tom<br>I feel like my reads are off</div></blockquote><br><br>history says this probably is a bad sign for my reads too :/"}

It can't be investigated (and I assume that a town ascetic is placed into the game to weaken the town's investigative power) and confirming my claim is a waste of a night, so there's always going to be paranoia around my slot.<br><br>B: My townflip will probably point to the fact that town is looking in the wrong direction, which I think it is. I am completely serious when I say that I want people to just put Maria and Kraska on ignore D2 and focus on the slots that haven't received much pressure. Kraska is really obvious town and I know I'm going to be the only one who sees that. Maria could absolutely be scum, but she's still a distraction I think, especially when there are lurkers who I can't even read (I think Karnos might be the town one, that's really all I got). More slots need sorting and pressure, not enough work was done D1 because Transcend was an idiot. Starting D2 off with another RVS/AVS actually is not that far-fetched of an idea, that's how badly information starved I think this town is.<br><br>C: Hell, if Elyse is town too (which given my track record in scumreads is plausible, this feels like Vedith 2.0 but idfk), then the fact that our wagons are moving at weird paces will help with VCA. In Open 649, I caught the scumteam based on VCA because D1 was centralized by a shitty wagon on town and I happened to push a counterwagon on another townie. Yes, I died before I shared my results, but that's not the point. The two wagons were stuck at L-2 for the entire deadline, and it turned out that it was because the scumteam literally could not do anything to get any of them lynched. What if that's why there's so many vanity wagons here?<br><br>D: I think Transcend deserves a good portion of the blame for this horrible gamestate for town, so his slot getting lynched is karmatic justice really. If I survive today, I'm probably not going to be able to obvtown enough to avoid rope in the future, so why not get it done now?<br><br>So if the majority of the town struggles to find a viable lynch, I am honestly volunteering to policy lynch myself. If not, I can do a Shadow or Gerry wagon if not Elyse, but I really do not care for lynching lurkers D1. If Maria's wagon gets going and it doesn't look like anything else is happening, I can compromise on it."}

After the mason claim blitz unvotes and says that she townreads trans but still scumreads maria.  That makes no sense.  Also there's not much scumhunting in blitz's iso @ all.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">giga</span> - Scumlean.  Hated trans.  Like giga a little better but still leaning scum.

That's not surprising, given how scummy that fakeclaim is, but it makes it difficult to know her thoughts on other players. That being said, I don't think she did anything super scummy. Yet JarJar, Giga, Nero all joined that wagon while giving virtually no reasoning, and shadow's willingness to hammer also comes after he didn't discuss blitz at all. This is a poor wagon.<br><br>I'm particularly disliking Nero's play here. Both with the Elyse wagon day 1, and the shadow and blitz wagons today, he seemed more interested in getting them to claim then in actually getting a lynch. It's in large part due to him that there are two powerroles out in the open now. That's not scumhunting, that's powerrole hunting, and more likely to come from scum then from town. Add the way he was smearing me day 1, and I would be happy to see him lynched.<br><br>I still prefer a Giga lynch though. Given how many players in this game were willing to give him a free pass for fakeclaiming, the mason claim is a relatively low risk way for him to potentially coast through the first couple of days, and build some towncred with maria in the process.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: Giga</span><br><br>Shadows claim is conveniently safe for scum. It gives us little information, particularly when he's using it to confirm claims. <br><br>Karnos hammer yesterday was terrible, and it still looks like he's getting away with not adding much.<br><br>Unless I hear some very good arguments for someone else, I want to lynch one of these four."}

Maria and Transcend are friends and already know each other well, so why does Transcend need \"\"towncred\"\" from Maria? The two of them townread each other anyway and can read each other well. The purpose of the mason fakeclaim was to defend Maria from getting lynched and I think that's pretty clear. Transcend has nothing to gain from it, and the fact that he was more scared of being blacklisted than losing the benefits of the mason fakeclaim is practically a neon sign saying \"I'M TOWN WHO WANTED TO SAVE MY TOWNREAD, NOT REALLY INTERESTED IN COASTING THROUGH THE GAME AS 'CONFIRMED TOWN'.\"<br><br>In other news, I'm happy with a Blitz lynch despite the claim. I think blitz's tunnel on me is contrived, I would have expected someone who scumread Maria and I as a team to reevaluate their read on me after Maria flips town. If, say, Elyse and/or Michel were to continue pushing on me, I could believe that it came from town because they have indicated that they scumread me individually. Blitz looks more like she's forming her reads around the fact she's been pushing for my lynch (the gerry and karnos townreads seem awfully convenient and baseless), which I don't really see as a town thing to do. Her claim also looks pretty fake, the lack of claiming a target looks like she doesn't want to be put under the same scrutiny Shadow was after he claimed."}

Like there was a day left on day 1. Its customary to have the person claim before they get lynched.

Are you upset you are not getting the mislynch you wanted? <br><br>I wanted Shadow lynched. I wanted Blitz lynched. Saying that I only wanted their claims is an unbased opinion.

And if not, that's probably what he planned to do anyway as scum.<br><br>Let's also take a look at a more relevant votecount:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8341081#p8341081\" class=\"postlink\">post 1652</a>, chilledtea wrote:</cite>Blitzkrieg (L-1) : kraska77, JarJarDrinks, gigabyteTroubadour, Nero Cain, Elyse.</div></blockquote><br><br>Seeing a wagon like this was probably impossible while Transcend was still in the game. JJD, Elyse, and Nero scumread Kraska and myself initially, and Kraska and I scumread Elyse, but now we're working together. And what is the cause of that? Me, of course, trying to get this town to stop scumreading the bait and focus on the slots that were coasting yesterday! By replacing in, I've effectively changed the momentum of this game and now we're lynching scum, because otherwise I would think that today's lynch would either be Transcend (if I didn't replace in), Maria (if Transcend or I were lynched yesterday), or Kraska, all mislynches.<br><br>Anyway, what seems to be happening is that Blitz's choice in scumreads are conveniently trying to disrupt attempts at town working together. Since I now know for sure that both of the mason fakeclaimers are town, disrupting and discrediting the Maria/Transcend bloc (even if they end up being wrong about their reads) is critical for any possible scumteam fmpov. If there was no valid push on them early D1 and if other town slots like Kraska, IaI, and yourself started townreading them, then eventually town unifies and the scumteam will be caught much easier. Thankfully for the scumteam, Maria and Transcend are not the strongest players and throwing shade at them is relatively easy. Hell, I dropped my townlean on Maria pretty quickly and I know Kraska did too.<br><br>Now that it's D2, we lost IaI. Why does a team with Blitzkrieg in it want to kill IaI, especially because he was townreading her? The answer is quite simple: IaI was against both the Maria lynch (pushing a counter-wagon at least) and my own at the end of D1, and was also part of the townbloc I was attempting to form. Him having the right opinion of the gamestate (in terms of townreads, which I think are more important), practically being unlynchable, and being a stronger player than Kraska made him a priority night kill. I'm still lynchable, so if the scumteam's goal is to dismantle the townbloc, then it's easier for me to be lynched and a stronger player be nightkilled.<br><br><div align=\"center\"><hr style=\"height:14px; width:50%\"></div><br><br>Essentially, my argument is that Blitz is scum because she noticed that I formed a relatively powerful townbloc and my lynch is a last-ditch effort to stop it. The IaI kill's purpose was to weaken that townbloc, because if she had killed, say, you, then this townbloc would have formed much faster and probably have been a bigger threat. I wanted you to weigh in on the Elyse wagon more directly yesterday because I townread you pretty strongly and thus would want you in this bloc.

Because bad reasoning is bad reasoning regardless of alignement. Only when scum is actually more likely to make a certain play then town does it become a scumtell.<br><br>@Thor: there's no need to lynch a claimed doc. If you join the Giga wagon, there should be enough there to secure a lynch. With a very strong argument from you there might still be time to pull of a karnos wagon, even, but that requires you convincing players on both wagons that Karnos actually is the lynch for today.

From what I remember, blitz was tunneling on Giga, without really looking for alternatives. As such, she was a strong cause of the development of a Giga wagon.

I'll probably have to reread everything (ooh boy) looking for connections to blitz. Previously my trans/giga read colored the way I percieved everything being said.

From the point of view of an SK, scumGerry would have been a good lynch. That reminds me of blitz' doc claim. She launched some discussion yesterday on there being a vig, and one of her accusers responded that this likely meant scum had a mafia doc. I'll have to reread the details, but I'm interesting in hearing what the thoughts on this are. Because if we have a vig who tried to kill night 1, it may be a good idea for him to claim his night 1 target, as it was likely stopped by a scum doc. A scum roleblocker probably wouldn't have led blitz to the vig speculation, and a town doc in addition to the two investigative roles that have flipped would lead to follow the cop scenarios so is unlikely.<br><br>Karnos, please don't self vote.

It's vastly easier to make up a solid read list as scum.</div></blockquote><br><br>multiple players had posted readlists, wth are you on... i mean i agree that it's easier to fake reads as scum, but EoD1 you should have very few nullreads and if you have non-null reads, back them up or don't write anything.<br><br>how is my logic backwards though...? and where are you getting the assumption i'm avoiding meta when it doesn't help me?"}

Tomorrow starts early again. For now, a summary of my observations. I'll go more in depth when I've reached the end of day 1 and have taken some time to think about what I read.<br><br>Maria, trans and nero were dominating the discussion, which makes it difficult to get a good grip on the thoughts of other players. In particular, there weren't really any interesting interactions with blitzkrieg, except that blitz was pushing against the masons.<br><br>I'm not all that interested in Nero or trans. Nero is an uncountered vig and therefore almost certainly town, and giga being heavily attacked by blitz as the alternative to the blitz lynch makes her likely town as well.<br><br>By page 30, shadow had done absolutely nothing. He hadn't commented on maria's early post, he hadn't commented on the mason claim or its implications, the only thing he had discussed was Gerry's fake dayvig. I see no reason whatsoever in his posts up to that point to consider him town.<br><br>Karnos also didn't offer much, but he was happy wagoning along on both the maria and the trans wagons. Add in the \"trans is town, but let's lynch him anyway\" of <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8314731#p8314731\" class=\"postlink\">#678</a> and I could easily see him as the third scum.<br><br>Up to page 30, Thor has been consistently asking good questions of Maria, while keeping an eye on everyone else as well. It's rare that I can't see where his line of questioning is coming from. He's probably experienced enough to fake this as scum, but overall my impression of him is good.<br><br>Kraska mainly stood out for defending maria when it was unpopular. From the first 30 pages it isn't clear where those feelings come from, though.<br><br>Elyse's first Maria vote might have been overexplaining a bit, but her vote on transcend in #628 looked genuine. <br><br>Overall, based on just the first 30 pages, shadow and karnos are the obvious lynches.<br><br>I'll hope to reach the end of day 1 tomorrow at work."}

A mafia doc interacts differently with a vig (block the kill), a tracker (can be tracked) and the gunsmith (investigate as innocent), making it an interesting role in the setup. By contrast, a roleblocker is far less interesting, as it interacts with all town roles in the same way. I believe that chilledtea therefore would be more likely to give the mafia team a doc then a roleblocker.<br><br>Secondly, blitz speculated that there was a vig during day 2, when we hadn't seen a vig kill yet. She is far more likely to guess there's a vig when scum has a doctor (whose main job is to prevent kills) then a roleblocker (which stops a wide variety of roles).<br><br>Thirdly, a mafia doc is more likely to prevent a vig kill then a mafia roleblocker. The mafia doc is going to target the scummiest member of the scumteam, and the vig is going to target scummy players in general. The chance of both roles targetting the same player seems to me higher then the chance that a roleblocker would specifically target the vig. Given that a kill was prevented night 1, this is therefore more likely to be the result of a scum doc.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8365987#p8365987\" class=\"postlink\">post 2300</a>, gigabyteTroubadour wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8363860#p8363860\" class=\"postlink\">post 2251</a>, Shadow_step wrote:</cite>Okay let's just consider this for a second.<br>IF nero shot me and I was protected by scum doc, it means I am scum.<br><br>Consider this<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8304747#p8304747\" class=\"postlink\">post 1</a>, chilledtea wrote:</cite>6) A mafia member can only carry out his faction kill, or his individual ability, but not both.</div></blockquote><br><br>If the scum doc protected me N1, he would protect me N2 as well.<br>Which means I did the kill, but only I didn't!

Scum vanilla cop makes quite a bit of sense, as we have a rather strong town. And I strongly disagree with his reasoning that a scum doc would have to protect him night 2. I can easily see the scumteam choosing to gamble that there either isn't a vig, or that the vig won't target the same player 2 nights in a row. Especially since that gamble would give them an additional rolecop result, and therefore help them find the powerroles.<br><br>@Giga: I'm only up to page 40 in my reread, so I find it difficult to answer your question of who is scum if Shadow is town. Goon/Goon/Roleblocker doesn't seem completely out of the question to me, as the roleblocker is a pretty powerful role. I'm reasonably happy to rule out you as scum in that scenario though, as I really don't think blitz would have pushed hard for your lynch as an alternative to hers in the situation where you were both scum. I'm also pretty happy to consider Nero a vig. Currently, I would probably look at a Karnos/Elyse pairing in that situation, but my opinions on Kraska and Thor can still easily change."}

The only way I can think this happened exactly like this is that Shadow actually investigated Kraska N1 and decided not to investigate N2, making Elyse the fake investigation. It's also possible that he DID investigate Elyse as scum (why is beyond me) and he guessed Kraska's role correctly, but Occam's Razor and whatnot.<br><br>There's also Shadow investigates + partner shoots, which is a bit more plausible, but then there's the question of which scumteam can take the risk if they still believe there is a vig? Or, if there's a roleblocker rather than doctor, then why is having the cop investigate more important than having the roleblocker block?"}

I'm not going to comment on Nero, as he is very likely town given the Gerry kill.<br><br>First of all, there is the transcend situation. He was rightfully replaced, but posts like blitz' #915, #922 or #942 look like she may have been goading him. Given that, her arguing for a transcend lynch rather then replacement in #930 could easily be an attempt to create an emotional mislynch. Which makes Giga more likely town.<br><br>Thor continued keeping up his consistent good play. His townreads in #1326 are all either confirmed town or highly likely town. His consistent defense of Giga looks good now that a giga/thor scumpairing has become effectively impossible. I'm still inclined to read him as town.<br><br>Kraska used day 1 to mildly push against blitz and elyse, while defending most other players. She wasn't all that involved though; the blitz wagon never gained much traction, and the Elyse wagon was mainly pushed by other players. It feels like she might have been trying to get townpoints for defending pro-town players without actually doing all that much to actually protect them. No strong suspicions, but I could see her as scum. Interesting to note is her #1376, which set up the shadow (role)cop claim perfectly.<br><br>Other then me, Elyse was probably the strongest advocate against the fakeclaimed masons, arguing strongly for giga scum. She was willing to compromise, starting a shadow wagon in #1186, then joining a Gerry wagon in #1218. Between that vote and the end of day 1, she didn't post anymore, so we didn't get to hear her thoughts on the Maria wagon. I find it difficult to draw strong conclusions on Elyse based on day 1, and could see her going either way.<br><br>Karnos continued his poor performance during the rest of day 1, finding the wrong reasons to argue for the trans lynch in #860, providing a virtually empty read list in #1345, showing intent to hammer without giving reasoning in #1379, and then ignoring the various requests not to hammer. Then in #1401, he already seemed to be preparing for a maria town flip, arguing that the giga scum/maria town scenario was most likely out of the four combinations (despite just having hammered maria).<br><br>As for shadow, I guess he made posts during day 1, but he was essentially non-existent. He felt that explaining why Gerry was scum one time was good enough to park his vote on an unmoving wagon, then switched to karnos despite not commenting at all on him before that. He would have been a good lurker policy lynch day 1."}

In this case, you would be Firebringer (someone with a relatively empty / not obvtown or obvscum ISO) and Karnos Zach (someone who did really blatantly scummy shit but got away with it because people found excuses to townread him). <br><br>Like I took a look back at the votecounts and you started the deadline wagon on Shadow... (unless IaI voted and then unvoted?)... So while I didn't find your D1 play townie, you have that working for you. I'm still mulling about how I feel about your reaction to the massclaim. Scum in this case would always know that Nero had a guilty on Shadow, so trying to stop it from going through makes sense. On the other hand though, Thor's approach to starting it was kind of scummy and your reaction to it could be just as townie. I've been trying to avoid having a strong opinion on you because I think my view of you has been hurt really badly by my Day 1 confbias. It's possible I'm right, yeah, but??<br><br>Point of that paragraph though is that your D2+ play hasn't really been townie or scummy enough to make me want to change my read on you. I think it's more likely that you've just been busy rather than avoiding the game/pressure, too, so... Just about as null as Firebringer.<br><br>Then with Karnos?

Compare Karnos's pushing a vanity wagon on you at first and then jumping on much more quietly), and his re-evaluation of the game post-Titus flip doesn't read like busywork (and if he wanted a smooth transition in faking reads as scum, he doesn't HAVE to write catch-up posts).

I find it difficult to motivate me to do work in a game when there is a risk I'll be nightkilled, so I kind of put of the last part of my reread until a couple of hours ago. It's now past 1.30 am, but I've completed my reread and want to post my thoughts today.<br><br>Nero is obvtown, thor's replacement almost certainly protected him after he's proven vig.<br><br>During day 2, blitz was pushing Giga hard, even when it became clear that blitz would be the other wagon of that day. I just don't see a scumteam of giga/blitz making that play. Bussing is fine if it gives towncred, but bussing to the extend that it makes a townlynch essentially impossible? Extremely unlikely. I'm considering giga town. <br><br>kraska's consistent blitz push during day 2, as well as her defense of giga, speaks strongly in her favour. Another positive point in her favour is giga's belief that she's not playing to her scum meta. There are two negative points: she was defending shadow throughout day 2, and her flipflopping between Karnos and Shadow during day 3 might have been testing if a karnos mislynch was possible that day. The points in favour of her being town seen stronger at the moment, but I'm still not fully convinced. Nero, what are your thoughts on Kraska?<br><br>Karnos has been completely tunnelvisioned on giga throughout day 2 and 3. He was fighting the wagons of shadow day 2 (post #1500), and the blitz wagon throughout day 2. Only at the very end of the day was he willing to reluctantly switch to blitz. Throughout day 3, it's the same story: he's pushing giga, and only switches to shadow when there's effectively a guilty. Basically, the only thing that speaks in his favour is the way shadow attacked him at the beginning of day 3 (no, he didn't seem a viable lynch day 2 to me).<br><br>Elyse is worse, though. Her position on the blitz wagon is exactly where I expect bussing scum to be: joining the wagon after it already gained substantial moment, on weak reasoning that can be abandoned when a good opportunity arises. Then during day 3, she was fighting the massclaim which revealed nero's guilty on shadow, heavily pushing for a karnos lynch instead. I'm currently inclined to suspect her most.<br><br>One question: I'm not familiar with shadows meta, but do you feel that he's more likely to fake an innocent on a partner (Elyse/Kraska) or ignore his partner in his investigations (Karnos)? <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Nero Cain wrote:</cite>I've been having doubts. Like, idk I still feel like his early game was a bit wonky and I wouldn't put it past him to go \"look I'm RVSing scum so I can't be scum!\" Sometimes, I think players play pro-town as scum and play like shit as town. I mean when Michel and I played in viewtopic.php?f=53&amp;t=67506 he spent the whole game lynching town and never ONCE did he go back and reasscess. So why does he do that here? Why is a scum flip cause for a reassessment but not a town flip?</div></blockquote>The reason I didn't reassess in that game is simple: I concluded that iranoa and gerry were town, and that zap was likely town as well. That left BigYoshiFan, you and maria as the possible scum. BYF townflip didn't contradict that view, so there was no need to reassess.<br><br>In this game, on the other hand, blitz scum flip did contradict my previous belief that giga was scum, as the way blitz attacked giga was unlikely to come from scumbuddies. This forced me to rethink."}

The gerry kill almost certainly came from a vig, and since scum is highly likely to have a doctor, you would know who you protected night 1. Once the result was out in the open, it couldn't really be fought, but trying to prevent the result to come out seems like a viable scum tactic."}

You are essentially arguing that faking a result on his partner is good for him, but because we know this, he becomes less likely to do it. As soon as he thinks we might think that, he becomes more likely again to fake on his partner.<br><br>All else being equal, Shadow would love to confirm his partners claim, because as long as he doesn't die, it makes you less likely to die as well. So the base action is likely to be done scum. From a neutral viewpoint, WIFOM can lessen the strength of that base argument somewhat, but to claim that it makes you town is ridiculous."}

However, they were expected to confirm themself by killing someone (which did in fact happen). The Bodyguard and Tracker collectively were meant to be able to confirm one player (and they did; the Bodyguard confirmed themself by blocking a kill on a confirmed townie, leaving the town one confirmation ahead with the same player count they'd otherwise get). The Gunsmith was meant to give a similar amount of value as the Bodyguard and Tracker together; and that was meant to be enough to balance the setup.

That's generally considered to be a pretty solid amount of scum power, so the question becomes, is scum here more or less powerful than that.  The answer is more... a lot more.<br><br>Start with the vig.  A roleblocker can stop vig shots.  But a block on vig still has good odds to save a townie.  Meanwhile, a mafia doc keeps the feature of potentially stopping vig shots on scum without having any chance to accidentally save a townie.<br><br>Next, the gunsmith.  This one is obvious: scum doctor gets a fake innocent (much like a godfather vs a cop), while roleblocker semi outs his existence by giving gunsmith no result.<br><br>Next, the tracker.  Here, you have TWO non killing scum roles, neither of which result in obvious sketchy outcomes, such as a roleblocker migth cause someone to know they were roleblocked.  When as a tracker you see someone visit someone else who doesn't die, you generally consider it an innocent result (all the more so if there are multiple night deaths), and don't much question why they visited (mafia doctor action, if sketchy as a doc protect, could easily instead be a pro town jailkeep, for instance, for all the tracker would know).<br><br>And bg/ascetic are both essentially useless.  Bg can only \"confirm\" himself by dying, which is really only useful to protect a really strong town role, or a hard confirmed town, neither of which this game had.  Ascetic is a named townie that could reasonably be a policy lynch for setup spec reasons.<br><br>Moreover, scum has an every night investigative role (especially if/when they realize the vig is out of shots, since then doc can kill if needed).  This means that towns only real edge here, namely the existence of a bunch of named roles (even if they're almost all crappy), is undermined by scum teams ability to narrow down who is or isn't VT.<br><br>So basically every single ability of town is actively countered by scum power, AND town roles don't work well together (vig works badly with bg and gunsmith), AND three of the four active town roles are limited shot.<br><br>The only real thing town had going for it design wise was lack of day chat.  But overall it was very scum sided by MS standards, with town powers badly coordinated and scum powers substantial.  I think the reviewers over-valued the sheer number of town roles and under-valued how much power scum had and how badly the town powers worked together.<br><br>Ps here are the mini normal setups I've been involved in:<br><br>1823 mod<br>Goon encryptor 1-shot strongman<br>Vs vig, tracker, doctor, 1-shot bp<br><br>1782 player<br>Encryptor, odd night ninja, even night jk<br>Vs follower neighbor, voyeur neighbor, odd night jk, even night rb<br><br>1775 player<br>Encryptor goon goon<br>Vs jailkeeper, universal backup, JOAT (cop/watcher/commuter/bodyguard)<br><br>Each was way more town sided compared to this one."}

Doc is comparable to roleblocker in the way it counters the town powers, so the vanilla cop is added bonus.<br><br>What I disagree with is your assessment that town is weak.<br><br>Start with the vig. If the vig gets off two shots, even on town, he has gained town a lynch. (suppose that nero shot karnos night 1, and all other nightkills and lynches remain the same. Then day 4 would see Nero, Giga, Kraska, Elyse and me alive, with Nero and giga confirmed and me needing 2 mislynches). The only way a vig kill will be stopped is if he targets a mafiamember, which in lategame spec is similar to a guilty result (see the day 3 discussion). The vig, even 2 shot, is a very strong role in this situation.<br><br>Next, the gunsmith. He gets a fake guilty on the vig, but the vig has provable actions, so that's unlikely to lead to a mislynch. Other then that, he gets a correct guilty on 2 out of 3 mafia members. That's not as strong as a full cop, but is still an extremely useful role.<br><br>Third, the tracker. This role gets a correct guilty on 1 out of 3 mafia members, and severely limits the ability of the other two mafia members to fakeclaim, as he may have contradictory results. If IAI had tracked me night 1 and survived, I would have to claim jailkeeper/roleblocker and coordinate that claim with shadow during night 1. Once shadow claimed vanilla cop during day 2, I didn't have a good claim that could explain my night 1 action anymore. Again, tracker is not as strong as a full cop, but it is a second strong investigative role.<br><br>The bodyguard is far from useless. It increases the chances that the strong roles in the setup (vig and 2x investigative) survive to use their abilities. If thor had protected IAI night 1, town would have had a guilty result on blitz. Even if it fails at protecting the powerroles early (as was the case here), it can still force the mafia to nightkill the bodyguard rather then the player they wanted to target. I had to keep Giga alive to Mylo because you protected Nero.<br><br>The weakest role of the 5(!) is the ascetic, but even that role functions as a named townie with a confirmable ability, so is not completely useless.<br><br>Sure, most of the townroles were limited to 2 or 3 shots, but that's all a town powerrole can hope for anyway. Surviving as a town powerrole to day 4 is rare, so the limited number of shots is not a huge downside.<br><br>My estimation is that scum was stronger then a usual scumteam, and town was stronger then a usual town (I would rate this town as stronger then any you listed). That's why I rate this game balanced, but swingy."}

Hell, just look at this game.  If Thor is a full doc he probably docs the gunsmith n2, and now we are back to odds with another investigative shot. Or barring that, my save on Nero would have also put us back on odds AND confirmed me town WITHOUT my dying.<br><br>Ascetic is not slightly weaker than 1-shot bp either.  It is massively weaker.  Bp is a pro town role that forces scum to waste an extra night kill to eliminate, which means that a strong town player can dominate a game with a bp.<br><br>Doc+vig or doc+tracker can lead to weaker versions of \"follow the cop\", which was the main reason I gave scum a 1-shot strongman (also had a chance to use it on the bp).<br><br>As far as gunsmith goes, it can get a false guilty on the vig (and out them both) or a false into on the mafia doctor.

And even if the scum doc does stop a vig kill, that is essentially the same as a guilty investigation in this setup. As you can see from the discussion of day 3, once it's clear that there are a vig and a gunsmith in the game, scum doctor becomes a logical conclusion, which means that the failed vig kill must have been on scum.<br><br>You can alter something in the margins, like getting rid of the X-shot on the gunsmith (what is the chance he will live past night 4 to make use of that?) or the X-shot on the bodyguard, but you can't significantly nerf the doc without getting rid of town power."}

A 3-shot gunsmith who's immune to being accidentally killed or mislynched before they get full use of their power role balances an otherwise vanilla 10:3 by themself. (The 10:3-with-gunsmith setup is only scumsided because the gunsmith might end up dying early.)

Blocking a vig shot on a townie is typically good for scum, as the townie in question is quite likely to end up mislynched (if they weren't, why would you vig them?) and thus giving scum an additional kill.

Concentrating town's power in a single strong role would make things even swingier. (As it is, town had several roles that gave a lot of information by themselves. If the bodyguard stops a kill, that leaves the lynch pool one player smaller than it would otherwise unless the bodyguard was already confirmed by other means. The vigilante is also unlikely to get lynched as they can claim to save themselves; that removed two players from the lynch pool in the actual game. Removing three players via night actions is close to balanced.)"}
