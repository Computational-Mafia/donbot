Read them and then do not break them. Some of them are so important they're listed here as well, because redundancy is your friend.<br>\n2. Play to win. Most players want to win legitimately, don't ruin their enjoyment by playing against your wincon.<br>\n3. If you have the ability to edit or delete your posts in this thread, don't do it.<br>\n4. Do not quote anywhere any PMs between you and me (including role PMs), or anything else that originated outside of the game thread. This includes PM timestamps and anything else which games the system. Paraphrasing is allowed. If in doubt, ask.<br>\n5. Do not use cryptography, invisible text, tiny text, or anything like that.<br>\n6. Do not impersonate or pretend to be the moderator. <div style=\"display:inline;color:#000080\">Blue is my color</div>, don't use it or anything close to it.<br>\n7. Unless the moderator has specifically told you it is allowed, do not talk about this game outside of this game thread or QTs I provide you until I have announced that the game is over.<br>\n8. Do not bring outside factors into this game. This includes, among other things, making bets, promises of real life rewards, etc.<br>\n9. Do not use any form of provable randomness. Claiming you rolled dice and acting on that is fine. Using dice tags is not.<br>\n10. Pretending to break a rule will be treated the same as breaking the rule. It's up to my discretion whether I think you pretended to break or rule or not, so if you're not sure, ask first.<br>\n11. We're all here to have fun. Tempers may flare, but avoid personal attacks and keep it civil. I will have very little tolerance if someone complains about the way you're talking to them.<br>\n12. Breaking one of these rules may, at my discretion, result in a modkill. If you are modkilled, you will become a Neutral Survivor, and thus automatically lose. Modkilling may or may not end the game day.<br>\n13. I reserve the right to change the rules. Rule changes will be updated here as well as posted in thread.<br>\n14. If you are dead, that is it. Do not post. Not even a \"Bah\" post.<br>\n15. If I happen to not be online but you know the game is over (for example, if scum get a quicklynch in during LyLo), please let me post the final scene before revealing the ending or otherwise discussing the game.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Voting Rules</div></div><br>\n1. Votes must be bolded, and in the format of VOTE: Player, using either the bold or the vote tags. Abbreviations, missing punctuation, and misspellings will be accepted as long as it is obvious to me who is being voted for. IMPORTANT: If I perceive it as a vote, it counts as a vote, even if it doesn't follow these rules exactly!<br>\n2. Unvoting is nice, but is not necessary.<br>\n3. You may vote to No Lynch, that requires the same number of votes as a lynch vote.<br>\n4. Once a majority of votes is reached (# of players / 2 + 1, rounded down), that person is lynched.<br>\n5. All living players, including the lynchee, may continue to post until I lock the thread.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Activity Rules. Read these, I'm anal about them. <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":!:\" title=\"Exclamation\"> <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":!:\" title=\"Exclamation\"> <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":!:\" title=\"Exclamation\"></div></div><br>\n1. If a player goes 48 real life hours (see rule #4 under Deadlines) without posting, I will prod them. Prods will be announced in thread.<br>\n2. If a player does not respond to their prod within 24 real life hours, or is prodded three times in total within the game, I will seek a replacement. 3. If the player comes back before a replacement is found I may allow them to continue. If this occurs when there is only one scum left in the game, or any other combination of roles which would clearly identify someone's alignment if something happens, I will extend the deadline until a replacement is found and can be given time to catch up (usually 24 hours). Other extensions will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis.<br>\n4. If you will be V/LA, please alert me in the thread. Don't PM me, don't post in the V/LA thread, post in this thread. Otherwise I'll probably prod and possibly replace you.<br>\n5. The 48 hours on the weekends count as 24 hours for activity, give or take. I'm not going to let people slide by posting once towards the end of Friday and then again on late Monday without a prod. - See Deadline Rule 4 for additional information<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Deadlines.</div></div><br>\n1. Day one and two will have a deadline of fourteen real life days. Subsequent days will have a deadline of ten real life days.<br>\n2. In the event deadline is reached before a lynch has occurred, a No Lynch occurs.<br>\n3. The 48 hours on the weekends count as 24 hours for activity, give or take. I'm not going to let people slide by posting once towards the end of Friday and then again on late Monday without a prod.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Game Setup</div></div><br>\nThis game has been approved for normalcy and balance.

To lure scum into revealing themselves via voting on an easy wagon.<br>\n<br>\nThere are counter-points to each of those that make it possible PeaceBringer is scum, hence the weak suspicion. Being that the posts do rub me the wrong way, it's not impossible that this type of attitude was common from PeaceBringer's time coming from scum, it's also possible PeaceBringer had adapted to current site meta, I could be wrong about PeaceBringer's voters, \"too scummy to be scum is a fallacy\", and the whole argument for PeaceBringer being town relies on a lot of assumptions on my part.<br>\n<br>\nI don't currently think PeaceBringer is scum, but I <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">do</div> have PeaceBringer in my radar as possible-scum.", "time": "Thu Sep 19, 2013 9:23 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=31485&start=25", "forum": "53", "thread": "31485"}

Period. There's nothing else to say. There's no comfort to be had in a read. (Well, not yet, anyway. <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\">) If I have reason to like a read, or if I have reason to be uncomfortable with a read, it'll be brought up.  For instance, if I suddenly got second-thoughts on Brian, \"I really don't like this\", followed by an exploration of why my gut didn't like the wagon, and what to do now that I didn't like that wagon, along with what it meant. Or in the opposite example, \"I really, <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">really</div> like this Brian wagon\", along with finding the explanation for why my gut thinks that it's the right thing, and what it means.<br>\n<br>\nIt's not really complicated. PeaceBringer will be where PeaceBringer will be.

Then that null becomes (by the very act of being null) scum. But until then, I'll let you know if my read changes on PeaceBringer if my read actually changes. Same with every player. At this very moment, it hasn't; still there are that level.<br>\n<br>\nOh, and I meant it when I said that I'll mainly be sheeping ABR.

Period. There's nothing else to say. There's no comfort to be had in a read. (Well, not yet, anyway. <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\">) If I have reason to like a read, or if I have reason to be uncomfortable with a read, it'll be brought up.  For instance, if I suddenly got second-thoughts on Brian, \"I really don't like this\", followed by an exploration of why my gut didn't like the wagon, and what to do now that I didn't like that wagon, along with what it meant. Or in the opposite example, \"I really, <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">really</div> like this Brian wagon\", along with finding the explanation for why my gut thinks that it's the right thing, and what it means.<br>\n<br>\nIt's not really complicated. PeaceBringer will be where PeaceBringer will be. If by, say, day three, I still haven't gotten a solid read one way or the other, <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">then</div> that is reason to be concerned. Then that null becomes (by the very act of being null) scum. But until then, I'll let you know if my read changes on PeaceBringer if my read actually changes. Same with every player. At this very moment, it hasn't; still there are that level.<br>\n<br>\nOh, and I meant it when I said that I'll mainly be sheeping ABR. While I certainly don't intend to copy him (my reads should be proof of that), I DO intend to trust him. For better or for worse. <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\"></div></blockquote>\n\nThis is still extremely wafty. I have people I think are scum and people who I think are not. What does this kind of back and forth do for town?<br>\n<br>\nI know what it does for scum; it sets up outs while still trying to look engaged. This feels and looks like you don't even want to make a solid judgment on PB, it just looks like you want to have an opinion so that people think you have an opinion, period.<br>\n<br>\nAnd I'm glad to know you're still sticking with your guns on sheeping arguably the most experienced player in this game.

Not practice. Not circumstances. In theory, yes, you're right. There's reason to be super-aggressive on D1. Heck, I even agreed with ABR on this point in a recent MD thread. In practice, it depends on context. And in this context, in these circumstances, in this particular game, I deemed it more appropriate for me to take a more passive stance. In part because I'm relying on ABR to be aggressive. I mean, I could divide the town's attention by going hyper-aggressive against you, but by doing so, I'd be weakening ABR's aggression against baldeagle. That's not the full extent of my reasoning, in fact, it's an incredibly small portion of my reasons, but it's still part of the picture.<br>\n<br>\nAnd, really. I'm being painfully transparent, here. It'll become apparent with time that I'm town. You're relying on generalities. You're relying on things that are true in the broad sense, but ignore the relevance of circumstances. Basically, to put it in other words: you're preaching an argument you could truthfully make as either alignment, because it's an argument that can be made in any game. Which, again, is part of the reason I have a scumread on you, because that approach ignores all the facts in this thread.<br>\n<br>\nFor instance, one such factoid is the well-known bit about Mastin meta. As scum, I start out strong. Push aggressively, and get universal townreads as a result. (And, yes. They are universal.) But as the game goes on, those townreads begin to degenerate and even reverse into scumreads, as people begin to realize their read on me was stale and based off of early strengths that I lacked in the current mid/late-game. As town, I start off far less powerfully--I may be aggressive, but I lack the certainty and the conviction my scum-self has. Because of that doubt in myself, others doubt me and as a result, I draw a fair bit of early-attention. Yet if I continue to live, I can reverse that around, by gaining confidence in myself and ultimately, scumhunting strongly and aggressively. Granted, because I know this meta, I can subvert it. I can change it. And by bringing it up, I could theoretically be scum-mimicking-my-town-meta of starting weakly and getting stronger. All true. <br>\n<br>\nBut I'm not using my meta as a defense, here. (Theoretically, I <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">could</div> be, yeah, sure, but I'm not. <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\">) I'm using it as a mild offensive, to demonstrate why circumstances of a player can make the difference.

Why are you relying on ABR to do all of your attacking for you? This is either super scummy (and a BIG reason why I'm voting you) or stupid. Assuming you're both town, you're just being lazy and giving in half the effort to catch scum. If you're both scum, then you're buddying up to your partner.

If not for retrospect, then to help put things into perspective. It helps to ask yourself \"does this team make sense at this point in time? If this person is scummy, what will this other person look like after the flip?\" And having that data from everyone, from either town OR scum, helps out in the late game.<br>\n<br>\n2. You're making a decent point on mastin's transparency on sheeping you, but you said that he has an aversion to bussing. He actually hard busses his partners; he stated it himself. And if you're really concerned about 1be1, you should be noting that as well. Whether it's transparent or not, I'm not comfortable at all with mastin trying to play you like a fiddle, at either alignment. I just think his reasons are scummy. He hasn't had a good reason to sheep you (yes, and that includes \"I have weak reads right now\", that's what pushing people is for)<br>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Second, there's absolutely nothing PB has done to make you think he's town.

What i'm saying is  leech players like you sheep onto votes providing no reason when he post so much info in short amount of time.

This allows me to see if someone else picked up on them. Also lets take a look at my views on Matias he was leaning town early game then the late game scummy null then had that hissy fit which brought him back to null. You can check my first game on this site where I was town. Even through the guy turned out to be scum I gave him a null read during the first day.

If you are town the chances of a scum Matias might of reacted different. I think he would have tried to flip it onto you before he raged quit. If it's town Matias it drops you to a null scum read because the little incident doesn't mean much. These two scum facts still stay through. You give no reason to vote and you then already insult a already emotional player that has already snapped and used that as a reason. It's like your saying \"Hey look at this player acting all crazy.

Matin 2 appears scummy I never listed him as null nor his sheeping as null. Please reread it again. <br>\n<br>\nDo you also think he was in the right of mind at that moment. When someone is as angry as him, enough to sub out do you think he personally cares about his win condition.<br>\n<br>\nIt's true I also said you are a scum read if Matias is scum. But your not reading it completely I said if he isn't I still read you Nullish leaning scum so either way I view you as a scum candidate just how strong of one is the factor. So lets throw out that circumstance about him getting angry about a scum buddy possibly busing him until he's proven scum or town because right now i'm not sure.  So let's say my read of you is now at nullish scum level to avoid allot of future head aches.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nOn a side note It's good you are actually posting more often now all you needed was a little kick.

You don't know any of my thought process's as scum or a power role or any role.

This is also my first none newbie game so I feel like I should experiment a bit and push some boundaries. Also if I didn't have teeth I wouldn't of gone for Bansky Flareon in the first place I would of picked an easier target like Eagle or T-bone.

You call him out on several things, yet you don't vote him.  You continue to vote me, who you haven't questioned in some time.  Based on your wording in this post, I would assume PeaceBringer to be a stronger suspect than I was.  This is supported by you later changing your vote from me to him.  So, instead of voting who appears to be your top suspect, you instead \"gambit\" by throwing out this Daykill.  A fake daykill is tantamount to a fake role claim, which is a big risk as town or scum.  Now at this point, you have asked, and confirmed, that I should believe you had 1) specific reactions in mind not only from PeaceBringer, but from other members of the town or scumteam, and 2) that you were aware of it's potential to draw out real PRs and took steps to mitigate this possibility.  <br>\n<br>\nThere is clearly no evidence of that here, so let's move on.  <br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>PeaceBringer wrote:</cite>Btw PeaceBringer<br>\nShoots streamers at him <br>\nReaction test yahhh you can party. Lets analyses your reaction hmmm well post 279 you seemed really confident but when you realized that you were being daykilled in post 281 You become quite somber in this post and the next even unvoting. Then I think you caught on to it being fake in 283 when you said it was weird for a daykill and then voted TCold again. Hmm why would you take your vote off if someone is going to day kill you anyway. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\nShould of done this to Banksy Flareon she's more emotional and would of reacted allot better.</div></blockquote>\n\nThis is the next time you mention it.  Here you've revealed your reaction test, thus ending it, but at no point during the time that you were gathering a gauging reactions did you do anything to mitigate the possibility that a PR would reveal themselves.  <br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Garmr wrote:</cite>@Brian Skies and Dryfit<br>\nI'be been thinking, if something is antitown but has absolutely no scum motivation. Why would you give scum points towards it. Is it Not the town win condition to catch scum. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">To me it seems only scum would latch onto something like that.</div><br>\n<br>\nLets flip the chess board for a second and pretend I am scum. As scum I was pretty much a null reading and people weren't paying to much attention to me other than Flareon but that's because I called her out and forced her attention on me. I was in the perfect position to just give a few reads and cruise past the first day. The most probable answer to fake a day kill like this is to make me look town. In this case doesn't make sense as the fake kill doesn't make me look town at all and I had no need to look town at that point in time.<br>\n<br>\nNow flip back to town view point. When I did my bluff I made sure to push that he only gives reads in obvious and not so obvious ways. I was really careful with my wording as well. Also there is a point that is town to what I did with this Test. What happens if my reaction test was Not really meant for him, think about this carefully who my target/s would actually be for the test. Just think it Over.</div></blockquote>\n\nThis is the most confusing part.  You call out the players attacking you for being scummy, but then you completely drop the issue until #346, but even then you don't go after archaebob, it's like you're threatening him to back off, or else you'll think he's scummy. This marks you as a survivalist, not a scumhunter.  <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">PeaceBringer:</div></div> Don't think for a second that I've forgotten about you.  You can start by commenting on Garmr, then on the TCold wagon and the players on it.  Even if it \"isn't your playstyle,\" you need to try and participate in the game.  Being fine with us lynching you is not acceptable.  It goes against your win condition whether you are town or scum.  If you are really that apathetic, then you need to replace out and find a different game to play.  Rule #1: play to win.  <br>\n<br>\nNow, a big part of me thinks you <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">are</div> playing to win, and that your strategy is to be entirely gungho about not doing anything and daring us to lynch you until we don't.

This was preceded by a vote, so don't say you weren't serious. <br>\n<br>\nAnd yes, I consider it unfair to the scum team especially.  I suppose that makes me scummy since I am allowing them an advantage, but so be it.  I want fair play.  <br>\n<br>\nNow if you don't want to lynch PB, although all to recently you did, then I certainly can't make you, and I've already entertained wagons other than his.  However, I consider it best <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">play</div> to lynch him D-1 or D2.  Voting to replace is not a <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">play.</div>  It is outside the rules.  It is therefore cheating.  \"Guard your honor,\" is a good quote.  You should live by it. <br>\n<br>\n@1be1: Fuck off.  My \"jump\" on the PB wagon was well explained, and the explanation reiterated several times.  If you take issue with my reasoning then point to something specific.  <br>\n<br>\n@Garmr: So your theory is that I jumped on the wagon that had already been labelled suspicious in order to not seem suspicious?  Or was I supposed to take their word for it that it was a scummy wagon, when in fact it was my vote that made it a wagon?<br>\n<br>\nI'm confused by your meaning as to posts #170 and #174.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>Garmr wrote:</cite>Post 314 you switched your vote for Peace bringer and tried to buddy me so I would switch my vote Then when I wouldn't switch you resorted to threats.

Which was talked about about being useless before. Also the fact you said in the spirt of voting people on that wagon. You were also on that wagon.</div></blockquote>\n\nI think I was pretty up front about all of this.  Yes, I asked you to move your vote and I will ask other players to move their votes in the future.  If you look around you'll find this is a fairly common occurrence, I was just more straight up about it.  <br>\n<br>\nMy PeaceBringer read is predicated on his strategy of posting fluff and non-content.  I can only see this as a scum strategy.  If you think my reasoning is unfounded, please say so.  Given that you voted PeaceBringer as well, I would find that difficult to accept.  If you think my reasoning is copied from other players, then I would say that 1) that nullifies agreeing with other players entirely, and 2) you did the same when you agreed to vote with me. <br>\n<br>\nIf you are scum, then you are going after what now looks like an easy lynch.  I find this to be most likely.  <br>\n<br>\nYes, I was on the TCold wagon.  Am I embarrassed about it?  No.  There is no shame in retreat.  TCold is far from a town read for me, but he ceased to be a viable lynch.  I would be remiss to ignore the other people on that wagon simply because I was on the wagon.  <br>\n<br>\nAgain, I see you going for an easy lynch.<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>archaebob wrote:</cite>Getting him replaced is not using back channels to unfairly tilt the game one way or the other.

His strategy worked. We aren't lynching him. That means that the only way there is a clear rules violation is if he is town. The mods cannot make this distinction for us, and force-replacing him would be game breaking. We have to just lynch him.<br>\n<br>\nAside from my theory above, I'm not ok with force-replacing from just a gut standpoint. This is a game. The rule being quoted is a subjective one. We can't let mafiascum establish the precedent of forcing out players we don't like.<br>\n<br>\n@ABR: If they don't replace him and you quit, I will never respect you again. I thought you were a more honorable player than that, but maybe it's just your signature.</div></blockquote> No, Banksys. PeaceBringer is violating the spirits of the rules by not playing the game nor trying to win the game. See, there are two halves of the objective. One is to win. Winning is an element of a game. But the other element of the game is having fun. And that objective is equally as important.<br>\n<br>\nPeaceBringer isn't playing the game. That goes against the spirit of mafia, regardless of PeaceBringer's role. As scum, it sabotages the slot. As town, it sabotages the slot. It's actually <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">less</div> damaging to the game if PeaceBringer were town, simply because the town has more numbers and can therefore take more of a hit.<br>\n<br>\nAlso, there's the matter of \"fair\". Imagine taking this scenario to the extreme: in a 3P lylo, there's a conftown player, a scum, and a different town player--the different town player votes the conftown. That is unfair to the town, in that the town player was playing against their wincon, but it's <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">also</div> unfair to the scum, because the scum just had their win cheapened. Instead of earning their victory, it was literally just given to them. Nobody is left happy in this scenario. PeaceBringer is a less extreme version of that.<br>\n<br>\nIf PeaceBringer continues to exist in the game, it's not fair to the town to have him sabotaging his faction's chance to win. It's not fair to the scum because PeaceBringer is making the game more easy for them to win, and they won't feel they've earned a win when PeaceBringer helped literally just hand the win to them. Vice-versa if PeaceBringer is scum! PeaceBringer's scumbuddies would be royally ticked off that PeaceBringer sabotaged their chances of winning. And I know that, as town, I wouldn't feel like I earned my victory with him as scum; I'd feel he gave it to me.<br>\n<br>\nSo regardless of PeaceBringer's alignment, him not playing the game is unfair to everyone else in the game and is deeply, deeply disrespectful to any player regardless of their alignment. Because when you sign up to play a game, you should actually be playing the damn game, and PeaceBringer has demonstrated that he is not. Thus, the force-replacement requests are not unjustified. Perhaps you have a point, in that they're premature. Ideally, the solution isn't to force PeaceBringer out, but to force PeaceBringer to play the damn game. But failing that, and failing PeaceBringer asking to be replaced, a ticked off player has every right to ask the mod to intervene because it's ruining the game for both sides (in different ways) via the sabotage.<br>\n<br>\nNow, ideally, you'll understand that. And act in a mature manner. But I hate to be this blunt, yet it's necessary: if you can't recognize the above, you don't deserve to be playing. You need to keep your emotions under control and think about the broader picture of the game. In which, you'll see that there's more to it than what you're showing. Players aren't asking PeaceBringer to be force-replaced because they want a tactical advantage. They're asking for PeaceBringer to be force-replaced because he's making the game environment miserable for multiple players, dragging the whole game down.<br>\n<br>\nImagine instead a player delivering many personal insults against players. There's a reason that it's considered a bannable offense nowadays and even before it was, most mods seeing that harassment would force-replace the offending player. Because it destroys the core reasons for playing the game. Again, PeaceBringer is not showing that extreme--but he IS showing that type of attitude, of not caring about others and being considerate of them.", "time": "Fri Sep 27, 2013 10:50 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=31485&start=475", "forum": "53", "thread": "31485"}

That gave me the anti-town intent.  It was explicit, blatant manipulation on her part that had nothing to do with actually catching scum.<br>\n<br>\nAlso, I didn't know at the time Banksys was an alt for someone I knew.  As I found out later, Banksys Flareon is an account that was made specifically to replace into Lucky's game and fuck with me.  We had a good laugh about this after.  Now I'm cognizant of the man behind the curtain, and making use of our familiarity to accomplish some goals more elegantly than I could otherwise.<br>\n<br>\nYou've already said that this game was hard.  I agree.  All of yesterday, I kept framing and reframing the narrative of who could be scum.  With nobody blundering in an unambiguous way, I got pretty overwhelmed by the number of different possible narratives.  Rather than fall into paranoia and indecisiveness, I elected to employ a theory of mine about how we can guarantee a pro-town lynch regardless of the flip.  My initial gut read from reading Matias was that he was scum, and my initial gut read from reading Aero was the same.  I didn't realize they were the same person until I went back and checked a little later.  At that point I stopped thinking about it and added him to my list of \"decent Day 1 lynch.\"  That list is the list you saw.<br>\n<br>\nMy quotes explain everything perfectly, Albert.  You find it odd that I would tell Banksys that I think she's non-vanilla.  It's not.  It's terminology I've used before.

The more people who post content before I reveal my result, the better the info we'll have after it's claimed.\"  Which makes me wonder why he would claim in this case?  You have a guilty on, eg, Brian Skies?  You prod Brian Skies for reads and poke other players about him.  Shouting, \"I'm a cop with a guilty\" with no intention of getting a counteclaim and then waving a stick about wanting people to post is just...bizarre.

Game opened 19 minutes after you posted in MD (I had it in my head that it was 19 minutes before, but upon checking it was after, so.).  Now the game opened in the middle of the afternoon (CST), and you have posted in the middle of the afternoon (CST) before, as well as evenings, so there's that.  Your last login date was (at the time) hours after the game opened.  So you had been on, though you had not posted.  Hence, charge of lurking.<br>\n<br>\nBut, upon retrospection, it don't matter.  Either a) you're a cop with a guilty and we lynch your guilty and they're scum (yay), b) you're <div style=\"display:inline-flex;text-decoration:line-through\">a lyncher</div> scum fakeclaiming and we'll lynch you tomorrow (yay), c) or you're scum bussing and this game is lolwtf but we're still lynching scum today (yay).  Unlike having to deal with Magister Ludi fakeclaiming a daycop (wtf) as town, you wouldn't do that sort of shit, so I figure absolutely worst case scenario we're guaranteed a scumlynch today or a scumlynch (yours) tomorrow.<br>\n<br>\nSo.<br>\n<br>\nWho do I think you investigated?  Not Maenara, since you're not an idiot.  Not Archaebob, because you said so, though I would've preferred if you had.  Not yourself.  Your scumlist from yesterday was Aeronaut, 1baldeagle1, and Brian Skies.

Not practice. Not circumstances. In theory, yes, you're right. There's reason to be super-aggressive on D1. Heck, I even agreed with ABR on this point in a recent MD thread. In practice, it depends on context. And in this context, in these circumstances, in this particular game, I deemed it more appropriate for me to take a more passive stance. In part because I'm relying on ABR to be aggressive. I mean, I could divide the town's attention by going hyper-aggressive against you, but by doing so, I'd be weakening ABR's aggression against baldeagle. That's not the full extent of my reasoning, in fact, it's an incredibly small portion of my reasons, but it's still part of the picture.<br>\n<br>\nAnd, really. I'm being painfully transparent, here.

As mentioned previously, he did it as Palisade in Slaxx's Post Apocalyptic, and he's doing it here.  <br>\n<br>\nFinally, with the exception of claiming this guilty on me, mastin has been utterly reactive, not proactive at all.<br>\n<br>\nSo tomorrow everyone can be all \"Well, I *thought* there was something odd about mastin's claim...\"  <br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\nMastin's entire set up for today has been off, which I already felt even before he decided to fake on me.  Does he try to get my reads?  No.  Does he try to get people's reads on me?  No.  Does he try to get me lynched without claiming?  No.  Why not?  Because he's not actually trying to get information.  He's just trying to pretend that he is.<br>\n<br>\nHis reasoning around Maenara's miller claim / another cop is just supremely off.  I thought it was weird last night the way he was trying to over-justify things, but it makes more sense now as scum -- if Maenara is town, then mastin-scum knows that Maenara-town is telling the truth about being a miller, and so assumes that there is a town cop to go along with that, then tries to back into that justification.  Mastin-town, OTOH, wouldn't need to bother because he'd have a cop investigation -- there wouldn't have to be any overarching explanation for their being a miller and there wouldn't have to be any reason to doubt the miller claim or assume the existence of another cop.<br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\nI don't, though, expect to not get lynched today, because \"lolz magz cop has report on u.\"  <br>\n<br>\nSo.  Reads.<br>\n<br>\nKnowing that mastin is scum, that's one.<br>\n<br>\nI think ABR is town.  I don't have knowledge of ABR-scum meta, but I've seen ABR town before.  He's driving, pushing people, prodding, etc, essentially being the most proactive thing in the game, and with the number of replacements that's saying something.  I think that ABR-scum would just sit back and let the town implode.  So <div style=\"display:inline-flex;text-decoration:line-through\">only</div> top townread at this point.<br>\n<br>\nThink Maenara is town only in relation to mastin's reaction to the miller claim.  Maenara-scum may claim miller, and mastin may distance from his partner on general principles, but do not believe mastin would go through the contortions about there being another cop if his partner was the one who claimed miller.  He'd just be all, \"Yo, you're a miller, I'm a cop, it's cool.\"  Utterly mechanical read, but whatever.<br>\n<br>\nArchaebob and Brian Skies are the likely partners.  Archaebob's also felt off in much the same way that mastin's feeling off (\"L-1 guys\", \"Yeah, I guess it was a lazy lynch\"), whereas Brian is more in terms of a relationship to mastin -- I feel that mastin's trying to pre-emptively distance himself from Brian because he knows he's going to be confirmed scum tomorrow.  mastin's D1 scum list at the end of the day was Aeronaut (town), 1baldeagle1 (town), and Brian.  That fits \"Put one partner in your scumlist, at the bottom\" to a T.<br>\n<br>\nI really have no read on DGB, Banksys, or Dry-fit.  TCold I'm reading as being white-knighted by mastin, which would make him town, but that's more me falling into PoE from Archaebob/Brian. <br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: mastin2</span><br>\n<br>\nPEdit: <blockquote><div><cite>Maenara wrote:</cite>*Scramble around in confusion</div></blockquote>\n\nIndeed.", "time": "Thu Oct 03, 2013 12:02 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=31485&start=650", "forum": "53", "thread": "31485"}

He's on a suicide mission.</div></blockquote> I don't do suicide missions. ABR, D1 and N1 went spectacularly for the scum. A mislynch on town, and two town killed during the night. If I'm scum, then I'm in an excellent position to make tomorrow mylo/lylo if all three scum survive. And this is true of my play. My stance on bussing is to not bus. My stance as scum is to try and get a perfect scum win.<br>\n<br>\nEntering into a 1v1 with Magua is suicidal as scum. Because (1) I am likely to lose it. Magua's a stronger player than I am, and cop guilty be damned, he's a tough lynch. (2) There's likely a real cop in the game (a fact you and I both know, ABR), who could counterclaim me. What if, for instance, said cop had an innocent on Magua? (I know that they don't, of course, and in fact, I'm willing to bet they investigated one of the NKs last night. Was hoping they targeted me, but clearly, they haven't.) And (3) even if I won, with the presence of a vig, I'd be dead before tomorrow, meaning I wouldn't get my mylo/lylo.<br>\n<br>\nPlus, it's not my style. As scum, know what I do? I try to make myself obvtown as possible, and then coast through the game. When a claim becomes necessary, I'll make it. But not a damn moment before then. And even if I were scum, I typically tell the truth in my claim. (VT as a goon, my actual PR as a scum PR--for instance, a scum JOAT with a rolecop, my second ability, and some third ability to replace my actual third ability.) Which I make at the most strategic moment. D2 is not the most strategic moment. <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\"> Not when said guilty is on a claimed VT.<br>\n<br>\nI had votes on me, yes, but a trivial two. I wasn't under the most pressure, not by the least. Heck, nobody was; the game was freshly open. So my claim wasn't to save me, nor would it be to save a scumbuddy. Meaning that my move isn't strategic scum-suiciding. It's town, with an actual guilty. Now, you can dick around and try and lynch Magua's scumbuddies, but doing so will just delay the resolution of this. I'm okay with being lynched, so long as you give me the chance to announce my other abilities before it. I'm not okay with delaying the resolution of this until a time that very well could be lylo/mylo, by which it could be too late.<br>\n<br>\nToday should be Magua vs. Me. Yeah. I think Brian Skies is scum. But what if he isn't? Then we go into lylo, with an unresolved me vs. Magua. Granted, yeah. A real cop can get a result and claim tomorrow. But there's no guarantee the scum can't get rid of the cop, especially if a protective PR guessed wrongly as to who the cop is, or worse, the scum roleblocked the protective PR and correctly ID'd the cop and nightkill said cop.<br>\n<br>\nIt's much safer to resolve this today.<br>\n<br>\nAnd for the record--even if we lynch Magua, I'm not a good protect. I'm a JOAT whose other abilities are not very valuable. (They can be, under the right circumstances, but aren't in this gamestate, especially not with me outted as a JOAT.)

A protect requires a correct target. None of those are guaranteed. Not with two scum other than Magua (three, if you let Magua live!), and not with multiple other PRs floating around. (PRs which, while I believe myself to know who they are, am not guaranteed to be right about.) The scum could have anyone target anyone, and while I can take an educated guess, nothing's assured. Thus, they ARE less useful than a cop. Nothing's stronger than a cop. They're not useful. I know my abilities, and I can tell you that. They won't impact the game.

Hell, if I claimed my second ability, the other one I 'crumbed, you'd see it even stronger exactly what my plan was. (My plan was a cop N2/1 and my other ability on N1/2.

Among them being the sheep of ABR, also among them being that I haven't eliminated the possibility you're confirmation biasing as town (although I'm finding that increasingly less likely the more we interact), and also among them being that I have better things to do with my vote than vote someone whose alignment will be sorted out before D3 or so.

In general, I am not a passive person as either alignment. So, then, why, pray-tell, am I being passive this game? Because I adapt my play to the game I'm in. And in this game, it suits me better to be passive at least for today. Maybe come D2 I'll be a bit more aggressive, and certainly by D3 I will be, but for the time being, I simply have no reason to be super-aggressive.</div></blockquote> Instead of copping ABR N2, the plan here was to cop Matias N2, having still neighborized ABR N1. <blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5328999#p5328999\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5328999#p5328999\" data-post-id=\"5328999\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 100</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=12314\">mastin2</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5328962#p5328962\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5328962#p5328962\" data-post-id=\"5328962\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 98</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=17288\">Matias</a> wrote:</cite>That's a lot of fucking assumptions there. </div></blockquote> Nope, not really.

In practice, it depends on context. And in this context, in these circumstances, in this particular game, I deemed it more appropriate for me to take a more passive stance. In part because I'm relying on ABR to be aggressive. I mean, I could divide the town's attention by going hyper-aggressive against you, but by doing so, I'd be weakening ABR's aggression against baldeagle.

That'd make it instantaneous, which is typically not the normal version of the role. Yes, it's an assumption. Same as me assuming I couldn't use more than one ability a night, which I also didn't ask the mod about. But it's an assumption based off of the typical definitions of the role.

Think it was to respond to a GD or MD thread.) I saw that D2 had begun, and that I had a guilty on Magua. And instantly...I rushed to the thread, and did the first thing that came to mind: claimed it. In hindsight, sure! Wasn't the best plan. But that's because it was a plan I had created in less than thirty seconds, because I wasn't expecting it to be needed at all. <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\"> As I said. The plan was for me to get an innocent on Magua. I was flat-out expecting it. You're telling me all the things I could have done when I received the guilty, but said things rely on me having thought about it in advance and anticipated the guilty, or to have thought about it in a calm manner.<br>\n<br>\nI was in shock. I had adrenaline rushing through my system. I acted impulsively on the first thought to come to mind. So of course there was a better plan. Of course I didn't do the optimal play. Because I'm a human being, who was caught off-guard, and got excited, and acted accordingly. Read the tone of my post. Does that sound planned out in advance? No. It sounds excited.

Now, granted, I'm already operating from the position that I know Mastin is lying and am just trying to figure out why, but.  He can't be a lyncher (non-Normal).  So my guess is either mafia with a drawback (eg, Mafia Don with a Weak Heart who dies N2 or similar) or is a traitor of some variation.  Both absolutely fit the pattern of \"claim out of nowhere, ask for opinions, post guilty before getting said opinions.\"   I lean on the traitor theory because I feel that a lot of mastin's play is attempts at signalling, but...just a theory.<br>\n<br>\nMastin's stance on Maenara and the \"other cop\" is bullshit.  \"Oh, there must be another cop because I believe Maenara's miller claim and there can't be a miller for just li'l ol' me\" is bullshit, because...well...I'll let mastin speak for himself:<br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5114342#p5114342\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5114342#p5114342\" data-post-id=\"5114342\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 25</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=12314\">mastin2</a> wrote:</cite>There's been a drastic increase in cop-less miller games</div></blockquote>\n\nSo this has also been bugging me.  Mastin's well versed in site meta.  He knows about the Miller-implies-Cop meta, but he also knows about Miller-with-No-Cop upswing (the above quote is from July).  I thought originally he was trying to push for a buddy to claim Cop, but that's not going to work after I'm lynched, really.  Maybe he's a traitor who's trying to signal to the Mafia who he thinks the Cop is, but I've looked through his posts for standard breadcrumbs and am not seeing any.<br>\n<br>\nAgain, though, I know that mastin is a smart player.  So there's a reason he keeps harping on this.  I just don't know what it is.  But his logic (\"there is a miller, there must be a cop\") is obviously false.  Furthermore, if he was actually town and actually a JoAT who actually thought there was a cop and *actually* thought that Town had no protective roles, he would be doing the exact opposite of trying to keep from getting shot.  He'd be trying to cover for the cop and take a bullet.  But there's none of that.<br>\n<br>\nOr, hell, a neighborizer shot?  Why did mastin not follow through with his plan of neighborizing ABR?  Not mentioned.  Is mastin the type of player to shoot from the hip or let go of a plan?  No.  He \"knows\" who all the PRs are and thinks there's a cop -- why not neighborize the cop?  Not mentioned.  Not even fucking considered.<br>\n<br>\nInstead we get this:<br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>mastin2 wrote:</cite>You don't have much faith in my scumplay. <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\"> Seriously. IF I, as scum, created a JOAT fakeclaim, I would lock down every single aspect of it in advance. I'd get the mod's word on how my ability worked. I'd ask about how my shots work, and if they're given back if I'm roleblocked. I'd ask all the questions, I'd have an answer to every inquiry, my presentation would be picture-perfect. Or IF I, as scum, needed to improvise a claim under emergency, it'd be something basic as to fit the dire circumstances.</div></blockquote>\n\nThis is 100% horsecrap.  Mastin and I are very similar when it comes to PR play, and as town or scum the very first thing I do is pester the mod with enough PMs to ensure I know exactly, 100% how my role works.  And mastin's saying he does the same thing as scum.  But as town he suddenly loses 50 IQ points and doesn't bother to ask the mod simple questions about how his role works?  <br>\n<br>\nNo.  Fucking no.

I say relative because Mastin is blowing up the thread here.  <br>\n<br>\nI want a Mastin lynch more than I want a Magua lynch.  His flip will yield significant information on several players whom I am highly interested in.  Magua's lynch will yield almost no information at all.  Compounded with that is the fact that the scum of the pair will not escape.  We need not worry.  Either it will be as ABR says and Magua will eat an NK, or we'll lynch him tomorrow.  Conversely, if we lynch Magua and he flips town, Mastin will eat an NK or be lynched tomorrow.  <br>\n<br>\nThere are several reasons for me why Mastin is far more palatable than Magua.  First of all, I have a town read on Magua, excluding all this mud-slinging.  Once they got dragged into the dirt it's harder to tell.  <br>\n<br>\nSecondly, calling out ABR as the cop was scummy as hell.  <br>\n<br>\n1) He dropped it almost immediately.  IF he were actually convinced ABR was the cop enough to out him, then why would he suddenly protect ABR's identity when ABR didn't own to it?  That doesn't make any sense to me, especially after Mastin declared several times that he knew who all the PRs were.  It looks more like he took a stab at a viable strategy for survival, failed it, then moved on to another one, i.e. calling ABR scum.  <br>\n<br>\n2) It really just looked like he was calling it out for his partners.  So there's that.  <br>\n<br>\nReasons why I find Mastin less palatable:<br>\n<br>\n1) I really do buy the occam's razor argument.  It seems to require an awful lot of forethought to create a claim like that, he presumably discussed it with his buddies, and then he fails to predict this outcome?  Also, we're calling him a traitor here, or something equally weird, in order for this plan of his to make sense.  I am ok with this anyway though, because as scum I am a huge fan of \"so crazy it just might work,\" so I can easily see myself doing this, or someone else, like Mastin. <br>\n<br>\n2) Mastin's reads largely gel with mine, especially in the realms of ABR, archaebob, and formerly DGB (though I am now confused as to what Mastin actually thinks of her).  I thought ABR's case on archaebob was bullshit, especially the part with my identity, and having played with scum ABR recently, this kind of play looks very familiar.

And when a person gets lost, they tend to pay more attention to what they are directly involved with and try to do their best not to be completely fucking useless.

How you even come to this conclusion is beyond me. I even explicitly stated i was going to trust Mastin and vote Magua. The only reason why I didn't get to was because the stronger players were fighting for a lynch on a power-role and it was completely illogical to me.

Both we now know to be town.  <br>\n<br>\nEverything he calls out is just... obvious.  There's no nuance to his reads.  His problem with Garmr is not Garmr's play, but the fake daykill (#311).  <br>\n<br>\nAgain, in #391 he is basing his read on Eagle on him not answering questions, a very simple tell.

Mastin's role went in three directions and was limited, Rach's was limited, so we're probably in a low power game here.

Especially at the end when he says, \"we're not lynching (or vigging) PeaceBringer.  He's clearly town.\"  Notice how earlier, arcaebob said something very similar about T-cold, a player we now know to be town (and who scum Dry-fit would know to be town).  He simply declared that we would not be lynching him when this was not a popular opinion.  Archaebob seemed universally considered town, especially by the smart/experienced players in the game, so Dry-fit copies his play.  This is a common scum tactic, one which ABR coached me to use in our last scumbuddy game together.  <br>\n<br>\nNow, let's look at his D2/D3 play. <br>\n<br>\nHe starts off voting Tcold.  <br>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5353454#p5353454\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=5353454#p5353454\" data-post-id=\"5353454\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 564</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=11629\">Dry-fit</a> wrote:</cite>I kind of don't know which way is up anymore in this game with eagle and Garmr both flipping town.

For example, <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">I</div> might not think your wording is a slam dunk scum slip, but I might also think it's not insane that someone would.  I might take note of the fact that DGB's vote on you is entirely predicated on the idea of it having been a slip.  I might then consider that because DGB's reasons for voting you are a logical deduction (stupid as you might think this deduction is), DGB scum and DGB town could quite possibly behave very similarly in this situation.  Following this, I might decide to push you to produce an explanation of your wording so clear, forthright, and uncontroversial that DGB couldn't possibly use it any longer as a reason for voting you.  In the process, I could become more confident in my own troubled intuitions about your alignment.  <br>\n<br>\nThink about it.  In a world where DGB is scum, the best offensive right now is to take <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">any</div> teeth out of her line of attack.  Force her to fabricate a new opinion.  Before she voted for you, she was talking about how one of archaebob/DryFit must be scum.  Put her in a position where she has to continue along those lines.  Right now she doesn't have to pretend to follow that line of reasoning through because she can plausibly park her vote on you.  And make no mistake Banksys, it <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">is</div> plausible.  You might make different estimates than me about how unclear/suspicious your wording was, but it is cavalier and unhelpful to not clear things up beyond any conceivable doubt when you could.  <br>\n<br>\nAnd frankly, it's not just plausible. I still don't understand why you worded it that way.  It looks like the kind of thing town-Banksys would have filtered.  I don't give a shit that you think you explained it at some point.  I've perused your iso and didn't see anything which addressed it satisfactorily.  Either me link me directly to that explanation, or re-explain it.  The problem isn't that we're confused about what you meant.  Obviously what you meant is \"I'm not the SK.\"  I'm not asking you to clarify what you think you were trying to convey.  The problem is the wording looks like it came from someone who subconsciously identified one of the kills as their own, and didn't go back to edit their word choice before posting.

I've expressed this throughout the game. You claim miller, but then you coast (or are lost and confused), sheep, and push early hammers (at least twice now, both to Rach). It's not town. The only reason why I'm second-guessing myself is because I am convinced DGB is scum and DGB was willing to bus you on Day 3. This makes me think I have the wrong partner for DGB.<br>\n<br>\nThere is also set-up speculation, which I know almost nothing about. On Day 2, people expressed concern over the validity of your claim because we only had a 1-shot investigate. Then there is the part that I can't find and I think I imagined: someone saying it was likely to have a weak town but not another town power role.

Today you look like someone trying to solve the problem.  <br>\n<br>\nI think Banksys is town because her posts today sound like Banksys-town, and because I don't at all trust the wagon that was building on her a short while ago. <br>\n<br>\nI can't pin things down much more than that because a lot of it is instinct and this game is hard.  But here's basically how I'm looking at it:<br>\n<br>\n1) Rach is town (we'll never know this for sure, but we can't really treat this as an open question right now).<br>\n2) BrianSkies and BanksysFlareon have their suspicions distributed between DGB, Maenara, and DryFit, who broadly return the favor.<br>\n3) I see no reason for scum to hard bus right now.  <br>\n<br>\nSo essentially I'm picking one group of players or another.  I've suspected DryFit all game, DGB seems <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">really</div> opportunistic, and I don't trust Maenara (or her claim) at all.  On the other hand, you and Banksys sound heavily like town today.  <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">Heavily</div>.  Which is odd, because neither of you did before today.  But at a certain point I have to pick the narrative that sits most comfortably in my head, and it's easier for me to believe that you guys were town this whole time and have gotten your head in the game today than it is for me to believe that you both suddenly learned how to be brilliant manipulators.  I really can't see you making the posts you've made today as scum (no offense).  And Banksys...well, if I'm wrong about Banksys I'm going to deeply regret it, because it will be the first time.  But my honest sense is that she's kept a cooler head under fire than she would have if she was scum.  Particularly when I was pushing her.  Maybe she's just finally figured out how to dupe me, but I'm going to go insane if I try and think about this in those terms.  The simpler explanation is that she's town, and that you're town, and that the three of us have a similar read on this game and should act on it.<br>\n<br>\nSpeaking of which, we're two days from deadline.  <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">vote DrippingGoofBall</div><br>\n<br>\n@ RachMarie -<br>\n<br>\nWhat do you need to be convinced to vote with us?", "time": "Mon Oct 14, 2013 3:25 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=31485&start=975", "forum": "53", "thread": "31485"}

I questioned her on it (literally, I just said \"what the fuck are you doing?\").  Then she decided to vote me and failed to provide reasoning.  Then her reasoning that she did post was full of rather obvious flaws which she failed to explain.  Then her vote started dancing around, a classic scum tactic to divert attention.  She was also essentially the leader of my wagon, minus Dry-fit, my other top suspect.  It was not hard at all for me to fathom a scum driven wagon against me to save DGB.  This view was vindicated when DGB flipped scum.  <br>\n<br>\nNow, why I think Maenera is scum.  <br>\n<br>\nThe DGB wagon happened when Dry-fit was a fairly easy alternative, as was my wagon.  The third scum player did not need to lynch DGB.  <br>\n<br>\nSecond, by bussing out DGB, the third scum player would be committing to surviving two more lynches.  The only people alive when DGB was lynched who were largely without suspicion were archaebob and Rach.  Rach's claim pretty much cleared her, and those players are now dead.  The rest of us have had our share of heat throughout the game.  Since they were not archaebob or Rach, this would have been a dubious proposition at best and a poor strategic choice. <br>\n<br>\nConclusion: DGB vs. Banksys equals town wagon vs. scum wagon.  It's a lot easier for me to accept that Maenera was backing her buddy than Brian was bussing his.   <br>\n<br>\nOn top of this, Brian has had a strong last couple of days and Maenera has not.  Maenera is determined not to take responsibility for anything in this game, and has been on most of the wrong wagons, especially since she is the only surviving member of the Day 1 mislynch wagon, which without her would have been an entirely town wagon.

{"number": 1071, "id": "5410614", "user": "Brian Skies", "user_id": "22309", "content": "Hey, Banksys. Do you want me to make full comprehensive cases like I did on Day 3? I'm still 100% behind a Maenara lynch and I <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">do </div>have a case against her on Day 3 that ties her to DGB. I can still make cases if you want, though.<br>\n<br>\nAlso, I threw out the set-up speculation. I realized I was digging myself into a hole of nearly boundless WIFOM and second-guessing over stuff that doesn't really matter. It was lonely, and dark, and creepy and I never want to be there again.<br>\n<br>\nThe things I want to add regarding Maenara:<br>\n-There are no trajectories to Maenara's votes, which seem to go with whatever the majority is feeling. <br>\n-There's very little scum-hunting involved.<br>\n-She puts a lot of effort into making us believe she is a miller, shows a self-preservationist attitude, and doesn't do anything to convince us she's town.<br>\n-She offers a perfectly logical plan which should have protected the PR role on Day 2 and lynched the guilty read (which I called her out on), but goes against it for some gut read where she claims she doesn't really have much of gut reads in the same post. <br>\n-Aside from claiming miller (which I have a ton of issues regarding your follow-through), it's not town. And it doesn't matter that you replaced in and claimed miller. Alice had one post which was a naked vote onto the early Mastin wagon and avoided the PB wagon. Basically, your replacement post might as well have been the first post for the slot.<br>\n-You claim you could have been incompetent this game, but it seems to me that you've had a fairly good grasp on what's happened throughout this game.<br>\n-DGB's interactions with you this game are weird as hell.<br>\n<br>\nThings regarding Banksys:<br>\n-On Day 1, PB was in a position that would have let him coast into Day 2 pretty easily. There was absolutely no reason for Banksys to call him out in the manner that she did and try to get him lynched that day. <br>\n-I'm not buying that Banksys vig-slipped or scum-slipped on Day 2. It was obviously directed at Bob and the first kill (Garmr) looked like it could have been done by Banksys, but not the second one. I don't know the reason why it was directed at Bob, but it's fine.<br>\n-The main problem I have with Banksys is the wishy-washiness concerning the Mastin wagon, but that reads as town to me. Banksys avoided taking a definitive stance on Mastin and Magua, but she offers an explanation that feels valid to me in her decision to vote Mastin in the end. Plus, her logic concerning the wagon and the Day 2 lynch prior to the vote reads as town to me.<br>\n-Probably the most uncomfortable feeling I've had in this game was Banksys sheeping me the instant I voted DGB on Day 3, but realizing that she made the same offer to Archaebob on Day 1 gives me some relief.<br>\n-Everything afterwards just reads as Banksys trying to solve the puzzle. Town.<br>\n-Bob said Banksys was likely to be town. I'm not just going to take his word for it, but it does hold some weight.<br>\n<br>\nThings regarding me:<br>\n-I remember voting TCold on Day 1 because I thought he was scummy. I don't know where my vote ended up because I got lost and confused for most the end of Day 1. I remember coming in and trying to re-read the thread, and then the replacement argument demotivated me from trying.<br>\n-Mastin's gambit on Day 2 was like a new breath of life for me and helped me get re-situated in the game again. I wanted to vote Magua on Day 2 and I really thought I had a chance to hammer her (not Mastin, nowhere on Day 2 does it say I wanted to vote Mastin). There was no way I was going to vote a claimed investigative role over the guilty. The only reason why I didn't vote anyone is because we had pretty strong players saying to vote Mastin, and I wanted to know why. My sister visits me on Saturdays and I only bother checking the site much later in the afternoon. The thread was already locked by then and I wasn't even on a wagon.  It's not like me not voting anyone at the time was a secret and it's not like you didn't know where I was leaning. I think the better question here is why were you so antsy to hammer Mastin early that day.<br>\n-On Day 3, I voted DGB because I was convinced DGB was scum. I was looking at the people driving the Mastin wagon. In my opinion, there were four people who were driving it, ABR who was the main driver (town), Magua who was the other lynch choice (scum), DGB, and Maenara. There was no way I was going to believe Magua was able to get that wagon to go through on her own. The deciding point that made the biggest difference in getting Mastin lynched was when ABR decided to trust Mastin and lynch Magua only to have DGB subtly push him back towards the Mastin wagon. It's subtle, but it's there. DGB and Maenara were the only remaining drivers for me to look at and they both advocated getting a quicker hammer on Mastin. Also, <a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=5361401#p5361401\" class=\"postlink\">796</a> isn't town.<br>\n-Why was I so enthusiastic about getting DGB lynched? Because she called me squirrelscum, barked at me, and was flailing in her defense. Plus there's that adrenaline rush of feeling like you've cornered scum.<br>\n-The only reason why I wasn't voting Dry on Day 4 is because we only needed 3 votes to lynch and Bob claimed intent.", "time": "Fri Oct 25, 2013 12:29 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=31485&start=1050", "forum": "53", "thread": "31485"}
