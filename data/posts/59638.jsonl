I think they're potentially useful, and as good a starting place as any for a game.

(That's neither here nor there, I haven't found a strong correlation yet between refusing to answer opening questions and one's alignment.)</div></blockquote><br>Is there any particular reason you don't want to answer the questions? (Related, if they're a distraction, why are you fanning the flames?) Do you think the several preceding posts by other players containing arbitrary votes is more productive than the questions I'm asking and the discussion I'm having?"}

He has no use for the answers to your questions and on the other hand you do.

When it's the one word that matters, yes, it does make it unclear what you meant.<br><br>I mean, there really is a difference between you asking me: Why are you answering this question instead of Josh (or whoever it was) and you asking me: Why are you asking me about the question that I posed to Josh instead of Josh. The first one, which is what you asked, implies that I answered a question that you posed to someone else, which I didn't do; and the second one doesn't make a heck of a lot of sense to be asking at all, since pretty much anyone is free to inquire about what other people are doing.<br><br>2. It's not a policy lynch. The \"avoiding the game\" scum tell is fairly well-established. Hell, it even has a name: the Ellitell."}

This often means forming wagons on them. We can worry about whether we are lynching someone for a good reason when it gets to that or when it's close to the deadline. Early on, it really takes away from the possibility of applying pressure to someone when you defend them so quickly. You did it with Luca on page 8, with PM, when you called him lynch-bait and when you said that you want to see a few more posts out of him, with Lissa when I tried to pressure her.<br><br>I don't think that your defenses are unjustified, they just aren't helpful. I think it would be better if you let the wagons develop or not more naturally and you should certainly let people defend themselves first. If the wagons pick up and you still think that they are for bad reasons, and you think that the person has reacted well to being voted, then you certainly should say that."}

Yet your responses mentioned his interest in speed-lynching Phijkchu_Magikarp made me go back and look, and I'd forgotten he was the one that expressed a desire to do that while his vote was sitting on you, which weirds me out. But I think I agree on your town read of him because I think the gung-ho attitude is a deliberately adopted persona, and I like the lines of questioning he's gone down.<br><br>When I vote, I vote with the expectation that my vote could help lynch someone. To some extent, it's to draw you out, and it's to state unequivocally that prod dodges are not acceptable long term. (The phrase itself even gets under my skin, and I think it's bad for the town to let it slide by without doing anything about it.) And since I voted you, you started contributing, so my vote worked! (That's how logic works, right? Something something <span style=\"font-style: italic\">post hoc ergo propter hoc</span>.)<br><br>I do have some indication of who's scum - I still really think Beck is scum. I wish I knew for sure if Beck was scum, because if he is, Egg is very likely to be a partner I think. I'm a coin toss on the burgeoning emogirl123 wagon, partly because I'm still not sure what I make of you yet, and Egg's vote on her is simultaneously genuine-looking and exactly the same thing I would expect Beck's partner to do. (CONFIRMATION BIAS WOOOOOOOOOOOOO) There are one or two more possibilities out there for me at the moment, but I'm either awaiting further responses/content from them, or I'm trying to make sure I'm not suspicious of them just for disagreeing with me. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\";)\" title=\"Wink\"><br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: Luca Blight</span><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Beck</span><br><br>I realize I'm probably tilting at windmills at the moment, given the number of people that seem to have written Beck off, but I just haven't seen anything townish from him at all."}

Partially because of the answer to the second portion of this: I took a very long hiatus somewhere around 2008 and just came back to the site within the last three months. The changes to not just the playerbase but also the playstyle of the current playerbase are things that I am learning how to cope with and play with / play around. Since I've been back I've won as town and scum, lost as town and scum and SK. Am I good or bad? Is it relative to the players I'm playing with? It's a deep question, and the short answer is still, \"I don't know.\" <br><br>Going back to answer the question about finding it interesting: What was it about my answers that specifically caused Egg to call it out? What's different between it and the answers of other players?

There is a reason why I voted for PM and not someone who had one post and peaced from the game.

There is obviously a reason why a player is an <span style=\"font-style: italic\">easy target/lynchbait</span>. In this case, it is his stance on Thesp v. Beck and forcing himself on the winning team. PM has done nothing that makes him town, and leaving him alive will have people continue to label him as an easy target/lynchbait. Being given this label, he can ride on the tailcoat of everyone crying foul whenever we try to lynch said easy target. This is especially costly at a later stage in the game.</div></blockquote><br>If he flips town, we don't have to deal with lynching him at a crucial time in the late game.

This just shows me that you put no effort at all into finding scum. Same with your vote on Beck earlier placing him at L-2.

Fair question. Asks what we learn if Phij flips town. Not sure why that's important.<br>277- Emo effectively defines a policy lynch in response to Luca. I don't like it, but I think Phij is scum and I can't see that being a bus. Emo just has a different mentality than most of us here on mafiascum. Maybe she plays on another site?<br>278-Luca says Emo's attitude is anti town. Not scummy, but anti town. At this point, we see a disagreement on theory, clearly. That theory is \"Are policy lynches good for town?\". If Luca can find recent examples of Emo arguing against a policy lynch in town or against policy lynches in MD, maybe Emo is scum. But I don't remember ever seeing scum lie about where they stand of theory.<br>281- Emo answers by saying she still sees Phij as a great lynch and doesn't think she is being anti town. Of course. What else was she going to say?<br>282- Luca says Emo's attitude is anti town. Again. Luca states he is against policy lynches. Again.<br>284 - Emo seems to think the discussion is over and shifts focus to Luca's question about her random vote. I don't have a problem with this. Like I said, it's going in circles already.<br>285- Luca states he is against policy lynches for Beck's benefit<br>286 -Emo reasserts her position on Phij. Not sure why.<br>287- Luca tells Emo he is against policy lynches. I have a hunch she already knew that<br>296-Emo explains her position on Phij and compares it to Llama's and my own.<br>297- Luca tells me that my case against Phij is fair, but he disagrees. Thinks Phij lynch is inevitable.<br>298 - Luca says anti town can come from either alignment and explains that he thinks Emo is scum. Not sure why when his case seems to be that she is being anti town, which he admits in this very post can come from town too<br>299-Emo basically says what I just said in regards to 298.<br>300- Luca tells Emo he is against policy lynches. Also makes a few minor points against Emo<br>301- Luca says he doesn't like Emo's policy vote (does anyone not realize this by now?) and calls out a fluff post.<br>302-Emo defends against the above. Adds that she wasn't ready to end the day just yet and that's why she didn't push a case.<br>303- Luca asks Emo to explain her defense further. Adds that a policy lynch isn't a great lynch (again)<br>304-Luca asks Emo why she is playing cautiously. He sees caution. I see waiting for replacements etc<br>305-Emo thinks she sees a contradiction in Luca's case. I don't see it.<br>307- Luca questions Emo for cautious play (again), states he is against a policy lynch on phij (again), says he thinks Emo is scum (again), and points out what he sees as a contradiction (it's not)<br>308 - Emo says she wants Phij lynched (again), likes the case on him, and wasn't trying to end the day with her vote (again)<br>309-Luca says Emo contradicted herself (again)<br>310- Emo expresses a feeling that she just can't win with Luca. I agree. He has his mind made up and refuses to entertain any possibility that he is wrong. He seems to think if he repeats himself enough times, he'll be right.<br>311-Luca says Emo contradicted herself (again), says he is against policy lynches (again), and calls out Emo's play as being cautious (again)<br>312- Emo answers the same questions again<br>313- Emo says she's done discussing it.<br><br>So. Luca. Are you talking in circles? Yes. It's the same posts phrased a little differently each time.<br>Are you wrong? I believe so. I don't think Emo is scum here.<br>Is Emo wrong? Yes. Policy lynches suck.<br>Are you town? Maybe.<br>Is Emo town? I think so.<br><br>Preview edit:<br>Massive. No. You are misunderstanding my point. It's not that your answer was well written or anything like that. It's that you didn't seem to be giving a genuine answer. We aren't going to agree on what a policy lynch is though. I don't think that voting for someone because you think they are scum can ever be defined as a policy lynch.<br><br>Luca, seeing policy lynch vs great lynch as a contradiction assumes the position of anti policy lynch, which Emo clearly isn't. So while you don't see a policy vote as being \"great\", it's entirely plausible that she does. It's all about perspective. <br><br>The above should answer everything else."}

In the other game even under pressure as VT, he still did not throw all his crayons the floor and leave the room. This is someone who rolled scum and gave up.

I admit that I could have a somewhat biased view of them, but here is how I see it.<br><br>Josh was accusing me of awkward posting.<br><br>When I asked him about it it, he decided to not justify what he's been saying and instead just say that he's been addressing at as he's going. There's exactly one thing that could have made sense there, as far as I am concerned, and that is when I voted Thesp, since I'd mistaken a post by flubber for a post by Josh, which made it seem to me that Josh was being harder on Thesp than he was actually being. <br><br>Josh chose not to mention that, and instead he chose to comment on me calling Emogirl's post cute. I don't really see how anyone could read her post and not get an impression along those lines. More importantly, he backs out of accusing me of awkward posting, and instead decided to accuse me of fluff posting, which is something that he apparently finds scummy. <br><br>He then accuses me of dodging a question, which I clearly answered, when I said earlier that I did not have a problem with Emogirl's post. <br><br>Finally, when I asked him about his stance on Emogirl, he didn't answer my question and instead decided to just explain that he was focussing on me. My question is relevant because up to that point Emogirl has 6 posts - I think that her ISO 0, 2, 3, 5 are fluff posting, but Josh hadn't mentioned her at all, which doesn't jive with him thinking that fluff posting is a scum tell."}

A lot of people are very dismissive towards your push towards Beck it should have been obvious to you that your vote was going nowhere. Reiterating your case on Beck while making one or two liners about PM does not influence people away from his wagon. I would expect a stronger push in a new direction in order to defend your town read of PM if you truly wanted to influence the wagon. Especially when your Beck vote was simply vote parking for a good majority of the game. Your vote on Flubber is irrelevant when PM is at L-1. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6370609#p6370609\" class=\"postlink\">post 484</a>, Thesp wrote:</cite>Again, my reasons for thinking PM is town are more than his stance on Beck. And can you point out wagons that you think I should be discussing that I haven't?

I see a few lines of vague reasons that end up just saying PM is lynchbait and he acts like this in all his games. My wagon was the only real counterwagon to PM yet you gave no reads on it other than saying I was a null read and you would support lynching me over PM. Given that your Beck vote was unsupported at the time, I considered you to be part of my bandwagon at the time along with PM. I understand that you have a town read on PM and a null-scum read of me, but making no effort to discuss either wagon in detail makes you scum."}

HI I was waiting on because he answered the RQS questions but the seemed to be taking more of my side on RQS debate, which didn't make sense and I was concerned about him just buddying to me.<br><br>Reasons Boo is scum<br><br>1) His stance on the no lynch talk.  As I have already said, this is one of the tells that is null because the player doesn't know better.  Think of it this way, if a kid who has no idea what a fire alarm is walks up to it and pulls it because its just right there on the wall, a handle and colored pretty - are they trying to cause a false alarm or are they just curious?<br><br>The fact that he doesn't understand this makes me think he is scum, especially because there is very little attempt to try and find the motivation behind the comment.<br><br>2) They are using a past experience to justify not really doing much in the form of pushing newbies.  If you are not being caustic, there is nothing wrong with pushing players, new or not.  If a question isn't being answered, keep asking it, keep pushing to try and find the motivation.  Don't call someone an idiot or other insults for the sake of being a dick.  This somewhat ties into the first point, but they are using a \"well... I don't want to be mean\" as a reason to not really push on some players.<br><br>3) They are unable to differentiate from me pushing for the reasoning and what was gained from RQS and talking about theory.  Theory (and something most people take for a fact) is that RQS is bad.  Pushing is when RP is unable to ever give any good concise post about what he gained and/or hoped to gain from something that is anti-town at best is trying to see if they could provide something that shows that town intention was behind the questions.<br><br>Side note, LAL is still a very good thing.  Lying is something that helps scum.  Most town who does it will have it backfire in their face and often be a major reason town loses the game.  Unless you can prove someone town, its best to lynch anyone caught in a lie.  There are a few players that tend to play a very lying/gambit type style, but they also are the players most of the site doesn't like.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote Boo</span><br><br>More stuff coming hopefully tonight.</div></div></div></span>"}

I see no attempt to distinguish between the two on your own. This can be said about almost every read you have given. I can't follow any line of thinking at all except that anyone who is voting you is scum and everyone else is town. That is survivalistic play, aka scum play.

I'm not sure that massive's \"defense\" of Flubber is all that strong. He doesn't mention Flubbernugget except near the end of the day when emogirl123 asks him what he's going to do with his vote, and he says \"I'm not lynching Flubber, I'm not lynching PM.\". I could agree that makes him a slightly less juicy target for a Flubbernugget nightkill.

Comparing from the only other game I was in with her (NY 170: Georgetown II), her play in this game feels different, but the reaction to her feels very similar. (She was town in that game.) I definitely thought yesterday that she was more likely to be scum than Phijkchu_Magikarp, and I'm still suspicious of her.

The only real strong moves towards anyone were aimed at emo, and massive of which massive is dead. and I'm still in WIFOM if Town Luca was making such a push on scum emo and nothing else had much traction, a Luca kill could have made a strong case of scum feeling threatened, considering other possibilities of possible town that would less likely be threatened with a lynch right a way like Llama and Bookitties.  <br><br>Even with possible Luca town making a push on emo town, the weak obscure reason for her vote makes me feel like emo is a right lynch for today, but egg's defense of her D1 makes me think there's a possible connection there. However Thesp's inclination towards protecting PR's leads me to believe that one is in play already and the massive NK was a secondary kill from a probably town vig. Unilaterally wagoning Emo doesn't make sense to me considering her VT claim. If she were scum, a VT claim this early wouldn't be a great move. <br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Thesp</span><br><br>I'm not going to lynch an albiet weak town read (based on a generic claim) just because she isn't a PR. -at least not twice in a row."}

Nothing stands out as scummy. I'm mostly reserving judgement on him for later in the game. But as of right now, as I said, nothing looks scummy. Lissa's early game, she asked all questions that I could see myself asking. It's such a genuine scum hunting effort that I just can't see her being scum right now.

Going into the Newbie game linked there, my default opinion was that claimed docs should be left alive simply because it leaves the mafia in the position that they will have to kill them (if they're a real doc) or risk missing their night kill. In that Newbie game, there was a strong incentive for a Mafia roleblocker to stay alive even for just one more night, and incredibly beneficial for the town to lynch a Mafia roleblocker. It made me see that there are some games and scenarios where the risk of mislynching a doc are outweighed by the possibility of getting scum, especially a power-role scum.<br><br>Also given that this game doesn't have a cop we're following (who requires doc protection), and other potential power roles haven't been outed, the utility of a doc at this stage is considerably less useful (and the overall win % hit associated with losing a doc is lessened).<br><br>I fully expect I'll be voting Josh_B by the end of the day to secure a lynch. I also fully expect to pursue Luca Blight again tomorrow."}

When I play, I <span style=\"font-style: italic\">frequently</span> say that I'm happy with my vote. (A cursory look through my games should confirm this.) I like to be crystal clear about where my vote is and my stance with it. I am indeed reinforcing my desire to have you lynched. I also have no strong desire to re-quote everything I said about you - I feel as though my case is strong enough to stand on its own and don't want to clutter up the thread with reptitive drivel that doesn't add anything new to the conversation. To that end, when I say I'm still happy with my vote, I'm subtly reminding everyone about where my stance is, and inviting them to double-check why I have that stance if they're unsure.<br><br>This is doubly the case when I'm on stated V/LA. I wanted to check in, provide a brief thought or two, and continue to remind people that I think the Luca Blight wagon is a viable, reasonable, and righteous one. You suggest I ignored your points, which is entirely mistaken. I <span style=\"font-style: italic\">disagree</span> with youre points. To some extent, this is expected - I'm arguing that you're scum, and you have every reason to argue that you're not (regardless of your alignment). For you then to suggest I'm ignoring you is particularly dishonest. I obviously don't think the case is terrible against you, I've stated it's the strongest scumread I have this game (and still have - I'd still rather lynch you over Josh_B, but I'd be happiest if we could lynch both of you today).<br><br><div align=\"center\"><hr style=\"height:14px; width:70%\"></div><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6396284#p6396284\" class=\"postlink\">post 743</a>, TheDudeAbides, referring to Luca Blight wrote:</cite>I mean, I didn't hack his account.<br>And I wish that he wouldn't lurk, but when he's posted it hasn't been bad.<br>Those posts are examples of that.</div></blockquote><br>Wait, I'm confused.

Can you also cite where I am voting you because you are third on my wagon? You keep citing this, but that's not at all in my reasons for voting for you.

You followed a wagon on me for a crap reason (even agreeing that Josh_B was misrepresenting my stance on emogirl123 while you perpetuated this misrepresentation when you voted). You then stated \"I've found his play in general to be suspect this game, I will probably go into more detail later\", \"As I said, other things about your play have generally seemed off to me. I will review it in a bit\", \"There is more in this Thsp case, which I will get to a bit later\", and \"I will crack on with my Thesp case shortly\".

If he is town, it makes no sense for him to contribute to a no lynch. If he is scum and Josh is town, sure. Dead town doc. If he.

His overconfidence in Llama-town is not something I feel a real doctor would have, either.  I also want to know why Josh is suddenly so certain about TDA-SK, because I don't see this logic either.

It's also more logical than what Josh is actually claiming. Obviously, this is just a tinfoil theory without a Josh flip or two kill night though.

I think it's plausible that Josh is scum and there is a vig or an SK.  His thought process makes sense in that case.  It's hard for me to see another case in which it would make sense.  It's not optimal scum play, I shouldn't think, but I could see someone doing it, I suppose.<br><br>I think Josh might have been rolefishing (I can think of at least two comments that looked to me like PR crumbs, and no, I'm not going to share them) as scum.  If he's doing it as town, then I have no response.<br><br>Josh has exhibited a weird exaggeration of what information is actually available to a town doc.  <br><br>1.  Doctors don't know if their protects are successful.  Josh thinks that he does know that.<br>2.  Only weak docs can tell if their targets are town.  Josh thinks he knows that.<br>3.  Town doctors don't know who the scum targeted.  Josh thinks he knows that too.<br><br>Josh didn't even mention you except in passing in his first post on Day One; suddenly he was sure you were town day two.  If he's a weak doc, I could have seen that logic.  That STILL would not explain the other things, but that's not what he claimed anyway, so it's moot.  If he thought you were such a brilliant and shiny town star, Llama, that you were the obvious choice for a doc protect, though?  I have no idea why he wouldn't have said so BEFORE night fall to try to draw the nightkill to the person he was protecting.<br><br>Finally, Josh didn't crumb day one when he wasn't under suspicion.  He crumbed day two, when he was.  Claiming doc is not uncommon as scum.  And I don't think Josh's play has been optimal regardless of his alignment day two.  He's crumbled under pressure; I find that somewhat alignment indicative.<br><br>Josh's later comments led me to believe that he was soft-claiming that his doc claim was a gambit.  If he's town and not a doc, then his behaviour could have outed an actual doc, so the gambit is anti-town.  <br><br>If Josh flips scum, I guess I would consider that a towntell for you, Llama, except that your logic seems so bad to me that I can't see it coming from a sane town perspective.  Meh, I just can't see scum linking to another scum so dramatically.  I'd guess you town if Josh flips scum."}

I've addressed your issue about scumslips already.  I read your rebuttal on my case, and it's based on your theory vs. my theory and not on variances in the facts.  Add in the fact that it was quite late at night and that your argument with Luca didn't look productive at all to me?  Yeah, I don't want to argue with someone to no point into the wee hours of the night.  If you don't think that a radical change in tone and an unexplained townread on someone and referring to the game from a scum perspective is scummy, we don't have a lot of common ground to start from in the first place.  <br><br>Josh didn't claim doctor until after I voted him for a scumslip.  I think a lot of people are retroactively applying that claim to prior crumbs, but insistence that there was a Vig/SK didn't read doc to me before that.

As for your self vote, I've been trying to determine whether that was genuine or not. I haven't decided yet. I don't think you were ever in a position where your lynch seemed like it was definitely going to happen with your vote. You also unvoted and if town, there was never a time when your lynch would have truly benefited the town. I'm not sold that it was a town tell, but I don't see any evidence either way on it. There's also a lot of process of elimination going on considering I was scumreading phij and massive Day 1, Josh Day 2, and to an extent even Bookitty. Also, I said I had reasons for voting you that I'd reveal later. As for Thesp's vote, I don't care about it. Much. Of course the company on a wagon factors in to a lot of the votes I make and I'm pretty sure Thesp is town as of right now, but I have other reasons for voting you as I said. So, coincidence? Not entirely. Pursuaded by Thesp? No."}

I like some of your posting yesterday, and my discomfort of JohnnyFarrar gives me some pause (as I don't think he'd be scum with you, but I'm not keen on him).

(Actually, I wish I thought Luca Blight was town, because a JohnnyFarrar/TheDudeAbides/Flubbernugget trio makes a lot of sense to me, but I still strongly think Luca Blight is scum.)"}

Cute.<br><br>So removing the people I think or know to be town, who does that leave.<br>PM wagon: emo/Johnny, TDA<br>Josh wagon: Thesp, TDA, Luca<br>Who is on both? TDA.<br>Also, I don't like his entry to either. <br>He scumread PM for what looks to me like a large portion of D1 but only voted him as the hammer. I am a total hypocrite for finding this a little scummy, and considering that I probably shouldn't read too much into it, but whatever. Also, he didn't have a vote down at all for a while there. Why, TDA, did you leave your vote unplaced when you unvoted Luca, instead of putting it back on PM or, say, Massive? <br>And he comments on lynching a claimed doc being the wrong move then helps it happen anyway<br>Who is on neither? Llama. Interesting. It seems like a scum off both wagons makes a lot of sense. Based on my townreads on said wagons and some stuff. <br>And I don't think all three of thesp/tda/luca are scum, and I don't think Emo is scum, and if I am right on that, he is scum. Hmm. And I only have two non townflips/townreads on one of the wagons so if my townreads are right theres scum off that one<br>If TDA is scum, likely only one of Thesp/Luca is. All three scum in a row like that on a wagon would be bizarre. <br>Emo's approach to the PM wagon/vote still feels town to me.<br>Luca and Johnny as scum together makes no sense.<br>If Thesp is scum, there's probably at least one scum on the PM wagon, too.<br>I think scum is likely thesp/tda/llama.<br>Looking at llama's behavior close to pm getting lynched. It seems like llama hopped off pm close to a lynch and pushed a totally different wagon with little/no support. I mean I guess his unvote when he did makes sense kind of but not the flubber vote really. It was at a point when everyone wanted to lynch pm and a pm lynch was probable which is interesting. Could be distancing from a wagon he knew'd flip town<br>Llama's tda vote today is interesting. Hmm. I dont' know if a bus makes sense right now. I feel like it does.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: TDA</span><br><br>I think that's l-1<br>gawd I've done that a lot this game, I don't care<br>goodnight"}

And my Thesp scumread has lasted all game and I'm not sure whether it still makes sense or I'm unintentionally just clinging onto it.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>VOTECOUNT 1.15<br><br>(1) <span style=\"color: #0080BF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Beck</span></span> \u2014 <span style=\"color: #008000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Phijkchu_Magikarp</span></span> (L-6)<br>(0) <span style=\"color: #008000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Bookitty</span></span> \u2014<br>(0) <span style=\"color: #0080BF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Egg</span></span> \u2014<br>(4) emogirl123 <span style=\"font-style: italic\">(JohnnyFarrar)</span> \u2014 <span style=\"color: #0080BF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Flubbernugget</span></span>, Luca Blight, <span style=\"color: #008000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">massive</span></span>, Thesp (L-3)<br>(1) <span style=\"color: #0080BF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Flubbernugget</span></span> \u2014 LlamaFluff (L-6)<br>(0) <span style=\"color: #008000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Josh_B</span></span> \u2014<br>(0) <span style=\"color: #0080BF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Lissa</span></span> \u2014<br>(0) LlamaFluff \u2014<br>(0) Luca Blight \u2014<br>(0) <span style=\"color: #008000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">massive</span></span> \u2014<br>(7) <span style=\"color: #008000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Phijkchu_Magikarp</span></span> \u2014 <span style=\"color: #0080BF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Beck,</span></span> emogirl123 <span style=\"font-style: italic\">(JohnnyFarrar)</span>, <span style=\"color: #008000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Josh_B</span></span>, <span style=\"color: #0080BF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Egg, Lissa,</span></span> <span style=\"color: #008000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Bookitty</span></span>, TheDudeAbides (L-0)<br>(0) TheDudeAbides \u2014<br>(0) Thesp \u2014<br><br>(0) Not Voting \u2014<br></div></blockquote><br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>VOTECOUNT 2.12<br><br>(0) <span style=\"color: #0080BF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Beck</span></span> \u2014<br>(0) <span style=\"color: #008000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Bookitty</span></span> \u2014<br>(0) <span style=\"color: #0080BF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Egg</span></span> \u2014<br>(0) <span style=\"color: #0080BF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Flubbernugget</span></span> \u2014<br>(0) JohnnyFarrar <span style=\"font-style: italic\">(emogirl)</span> \u2014<br>(6) <span style=\"color: #008000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Josh_B</span></span> \u2014 <span style=\"color: #0080BF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Egg</span></span>, <span style=\"color: #0080BF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Lissa,</span></span> <span style=\"color: #008000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Bookitty</span></span>, Thesp, TheDudeAbides, Luca Blight (L-0)<br>(2) <span style=\"color: #0080BF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Lissa</span></span> \u2014 <span style=\"color: #008000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Josh_B</span></span>, LlamaFluff (L-4)<br>(0) LlamaFluff \u2014<br>(2) Luca Blight \u2014 <span style=\"color: #0080BF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Flubbernugget,</span></span> JohnnyFarrar <span style=\"font-style: italic\">(emogirl)</span> (L-4)<br>(0) TheDudeAbides \u2014<br>(0) Thesp \u2014<br><br>(1) Not Voting \u2014 <span style=\"color: #0080BF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Beck</span></span><br></div></blockquote><br>Egg, me and Bookitty are in the same order on both. Cute.<br><br>So removing the people I think or know to be town, who does that leave.<br>PM wagon: emo/Johnny, TDA<br>Josh wagon: Thesp, TDA, Luca<br>Who is on both? TDA.<br>Also, I don't like his entry to either. <br>He scumread PM for what looks to me like a large portion of D1 but only voted him as the hammer. I am a total hypocrite for finding this a little scummy, and considering that I probably shouldn't read too much into it, but whatever. Also, he didn't have a vote down at all for a while there. Why, TDA, did you leave your vote unplaced when you unvoted Luca, instead of putting it back on PM or, say, Massive? <br>And he comments on lynching a claimed doc being the wrong move then helps it happen anyway<br>Who is on neither? Llama. Interesting. It seems like a scum off both wagons makes a lot of sense. Based on my townreads on said wagons and some stuff. <br>And I don't think all three of thesp/tda/luca are scum, and I don't think Emo is scum, and if I am right on that, he is scum. Hmm. And I only have two non townflips/townreads on one of the wagons so if my townreads are right theres scum off that one<br>If TDA is scum, likely only one of Thesp/Luca is. All three scum in a row like that on a wagon would be bizarre. <br>Emo's approach to the PM wagon/vote still feels town to me.<br>Luca and Johnny as scum together makes no sense.<br>If Thesp is scum, there's probably at least one scum on the PM wagon, too.<br>I think scum is likely thesp/tda/llama.<br>Looking at llama's behavior close to pm getting lynched. It seems like llama hopped off pm close to a lynch and pushed a totally different wagon with little/no support. I mean I guess his unvote when he did makes sense kind of but not the flubber vote really. It was at a point when everyone wanted to lynch pm and a pm lynch was probable which is interesting. Could be distancing from a wagon he knew'd flip town<br>Llama's tda vote today is interesting. Hmm. I dont' know if a bus makes sense right now. I feel like it does.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: TDA</span><br><br>I think that's l-1<br>gawd I've done that a lot this game, I don't care<br>goodnight</div></blockquote>"}

The reasoning behind a no lynch assumes scum wouldn't waste their kill like that. So by arguing against a no lynch, you think they would do it.

And let me be clear that I don't want this to turn into \"what happened to the kill?\" because there's no reason to out potential power roles.
