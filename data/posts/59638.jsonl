If you think they won't help or hurt, answering them is the easiest way to not turn the first several days into some drama-magnet about whether or not you should answer questions you don't think are useful.

The first one, which is what you asked, implies that I answered a question that you posed to someone else, which I didn't do; and the second one doesn't make a heck of a lot of sense to be asking at all, since pretty much anyone is free to inquire about what other people are doing.<br>\n<br>\n2.

This often means forming wagons on them. We can worry about whether we are lynching someone for a good reason when it gets to that or when it's close to the deadline. Early on, it really takes away from the possibility of applying pressure to someone when you defend them so quickly. You did it with Luca on page 8, with PM, when you called him lynch-bait and when you said that you want to see a few more posts out of him, with Lissa when I tried to pressure her.<br>\n<br>\nI don't think that your defenses are unjustified, they just aren't helpful. I think it would be better if you let the wagons develop or not more naturally and you should certainly let people defend themselves first. If the wagons pick up and you still think that they are for bad reasons, and you think that the person has reacted well to being voted, then you certainly should say that.", "time": "Sun Nov 02, 2014 1:28 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=59638&start=200", "forum": "53", "thread": "59638"}

I feel like as scum he'd have asked his buddies already and would come in more confident and less lost. Even if he is an alt, not a true newb, I'd expect the same tells to be mimicked.

However, I don't like him calling those votes policy. Beck, do you actually believe that the people voting you are doing it out of policy rather than scum reading you? Do you think anyone on your wagon is opportunistic scum trying to capitalize on the momentum? Your post 72 is a very good point against Thesp though.<br>\n-Emo. Very last post on Page 3.

Yet your responses mentioned his interest in speed-lynching Phijkchu_Magikarp made me go back and look, and I'd forgotten he was the one that expressed a desire to do that while his vote was sitting on you, which weirds me out. But I think I agree on your town read of him because I think the gung-ho attitude is a deliberately adopted persona, and I like the lines of questioning he's gone down.<br>\n<br>\nWhen I vote, I vote with the expectation that my vote could help lynch someone. To some extent, it's to draw you out, and it's to state unequivocally that prod dodges are not acceptable long term. (The phrase itself even gets under my skin, and I think it's bad for the town to let it slide by without doing anything about it.) And since I voted you, you started contributing, so my vote worked! (That's how logic works, right? Something something <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">post hoc ergo propter hoc</div>.)<br>\n<br>\nI do have some indication of who's scum - I still really think Beck is scum. I wish I knew for sure if Beck was scum, because if he is, Egg is very likely to be a partner I think. I'm a coin toss on the burgeoning emogirl123 wagon, partly because I'm still not sure what I make of you yet, and Egg's vote on her is simultaneously genuine-looking and exactly the same thing I would expect Beck's partner to do. (CONFIRMATION BIAS WOOOOOOOOOOOOO) There are one or two more possibilities out there for me at the moment, but I'm either awaiting further responses/content from them, or I'm trying to make sure I'm not suspicious of them just for disagreeing with me. <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\";)\" title=\"Wink\"><br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: Luca Blight</span><br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Beck</span><br>\n<br>\nI realize I'm probably tilting at windmills at the moment, given the number of people that seem to have written Beck off, but I just haven't seen anything townish from him at all.", "time": "Mon Nov 03, 2014 9:18 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=59638&start=225", "forum": "53", "thread": "59638"}

Fair question. Asks what we learn if Phij flips town. Not sure why that's important.<br>\n277- Emo effectively defines a policy lynch in response to Luca. I don't like it, but I think Phij is scum and I can't see that being a bus. Emo just has a different mentality than most of us here on mafiascum. Maybe she plays on another site?<br>\n278-Luca says Emo's attitude is anti town. Not scummy, but anti town. At this point, we see a disagreement on theory, clearly. That theory is \"Are policy lynches good for town?\". If Luca can find recent examples of Emo arguing against a policy lynch in town or against policy lynches in MD, maybe Emo is scum. But I don't remember ever seeing scum lie about where they stand of theory.<br>\n281- Emo answers by saying she still sees Phij as a great lynch and doesn't think she is being anti town. Of course. What else was she going to say?<br>\n282- Luca says Emo's attitude is anti town. Again. Luca states he is against policy lynches.

I have a hunch she already knew that<br>\n296-Emo explains her position on Phij and compares it to Llama's and my own.<br>\n297- Luca tells me that my case against Phij is fair, but he disagrees. Thinks Phij lynch is inevitable.<br>\n298 - Luca says anti town can come from either alignment and explains that he thinks Emo is scum. Not sure why when his case seems to be that she is being anti town, which he admits in this very post can come from town too<br>\n299-Emo basically says what I just said in regards to 298.<br>\n300- Luca tells Emo he is against policy lynches. Also makes a few minor points against Emo<br>\n301- Luca says he doesn't like Emo's policy vote (does anyone not realize this by now?) and calls out a fluff post.<br>\n302-Emo defends against the above. Adds that she wasn't ready to end the day just yet and that's why she didn't push a case.<br>\n303- Luca asks Emo to explain her defense further. Adds that a policy lynch isn't a great lynch (again)<br>\n304-Luca asks Emo why she is playing cautiously. He sees caution. I see waiting for replacements etc<br>\n305-Emo thinks she sees a contradiction in Luca's case. I don't see it.<br>\n307- Luca questions Emo for cautious play (again), states he is against a policy lynch on phij (again), says he thinks Emo is scum (again), and points out what he sees as a contradiction (it's not)<br>\n308 - Emo says she wants Phij lynched (again), likes the case on him, and wasn't trying to end the day with her vote (again)<br>\n309-Luca says Emo contradicted herself (again)<br>\n310- Emo expresses a feeling that she just can't win with Luca. I agree. He has his mind made up and refuses to entertain any possibility that he is wrong.

Luca. Are you talking in circles? Yes. It's the same posts phrased a little differently each time.<br>\nAre you wrong? I believe so. I don't think Emo is scum here.<br>\nIs Emo wrong? Yes.

He makes an effort to understand why people are casting their votes and if they have town motivation for doing so (See quotes above).

It looks to me as if he himself does not believe in his initial Beck vote or any of his scum reads. In the other game even under pressure as VT, he still did not throw all his crayons the floor and leave the room. This is someone who rolled scum and gave up.

I am going to point out, though, that your vote on Beck looks really bad in terms of timing and justification.  <br>\n<br>\nI have a townread on Beck.  Whether I'm right or wrong, the things you are saying about Beck are equally true of you if he is town.  There are a few scenarios that could be plausible:<br>\n<br>\n<ul><li>Beck could be scum drumming up a theory argument with town-Thesp to distract everyone from scumhunting<br>\nBeck could be town arguing against town-Thesp's deeply held theory beliefs<br>\nBeck could be town disagreeing with scum-Thesp on theory and spotting scumtells that support his distrust</li></ul><br>\n<br>\nI obviously think the latter is the correct one, but I've been known to be wrong.  Your case on Beck, however, doesn't sound like any of these. If Beck is town, you are doing to him ineffectively what you're accusing him of doing to you more effectively.<br>\n<br>\nWhat is the relevance of Thesp being a veteran player to Beck being scum?  Is it impermissible to disagree with a veteran player, even if you think they're wrong?  Why is Beck scummy for disagreeing while LlamaFluff gets a pass?<br>\n<br>\nThese are questions I had while reading your posts in this game.

There's exactly one thing that could have made sense there, as far as I am concerned, and that is when I voted Thesp, since I'd mistaken a post by flubber for a post by Josh, which made it seem to me that Josh was being harder on Thesp than he was actually being. <br>\n<br>\nJosh chose not to mention that, and instead he chose to comment on me calling Emogirl's post cute. I don't really see how anyone could read her post and not get an impression along those lines. More importantly, he backs out of accusing me of awkward posting, and instead decided to accuse me of fluff posting, which is something that he apparently finds scummy. <br>\n<br>\nHe then accuses me of dodging a question, which I clearly answered, when I said earlier that I did not have a problem with Emogirl's post. <br>\n<br>\nFinally, when I asked him about his stance on Emogirl, he didn't answer my question and instead decided to just explain that he was focussing on me.

A lot of people are very dismissive towards your push towards Beck it should have been obvious to you that your vote was going nowhere. Reiterating your case on Beck while making one or two liners about PM does not influence people away from his wagon. I would expect a stronger push in a new direction in order to defend your town read of PM if you truly wanted to influence the wagon.

I see a few lines of vague reasons that end up just saying PM is lynchbait and he acts like this in all his games. My wagon was the only real counterwagon to PM yet you gave no reads on it other than saying I was a null read and you would support lynching me over PM.

RP still a mild scumread.  Rest vary levels of town.  HI I was waiting on because he answered the RQS questions but the seemed to be taking more of my side on RQS debate, which didn't make sense and I was concerned about him just buddying to me.<br>\n<br>\nReasons Boo is scum<br>\n<br>\n1) His stance on the no lynch talk.  As I have already said, this is one of the tells that is null because the player doesn't know better.  Think of it this way, if a kid who has no idea what a fire alarm is walks up to it and pulls it because its just right there on the wall, a handle and colored pretty - are they trying to cause a false alarm or are they just curious?<br>\n<br>\nThe fact that he doesn't understand this makes me think he is scum, especially because there is very little attempt to try and find the motivation behind the comment.<br>\n<br>\n2) They are using a past experience to justify not really doing much in the form of pushing newbies.  If you are not being caustic, there is nothing wrong with pushing players, new or not.  If a question isn't being answered, keep asking it, keep pushing to try and find the motivation.  Don't call someone an idiot or other insults for the sake of being a dick.  This somewhat ties into the first point, but they are using a \"well... I don't want to be mean\" as a reason to not really push on some players.<br>\n<br>\n3) They are unable to differentiate from me pushing for the reasoning and what was gained from RQS and talking about theory.  Theory (and something most people take for a fact) is that RQS is bad.  Pushing is when RP is unable to ever give any good concise post about what he gained and/or hoped to gain from something that is anti-town at best is trying to see if they could provide something that shows that town intention was behind the questions.<br>\n<br>\nSide note, LAL is still a very good thing.  Lying is something that helps scum.  Most town who does it will have it backfire in their face and often be a major reason town loses the game.  Unless you can prove someone town, its best to lynch anyone caught in a lie.  There are a few players that tend to play a very lying/gambit type style, but they also are the players most of the site doesn't like.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote Boo</div><br>\n<br>\nMore stuff coming hopefully tonight.</div></div></div>", "time": "Mon Nov 10, 2014 3:33 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=59638&start=500", "forum": "53", "thread": "59638"}

What about my case specifically reads as scum motivated rather than just misguided if you are actually town? See, this is why I think you are scum. I see no attempt to distinguish between the two on your own. This can be said about almost every read you have given.

I'm not sure that massive's \"defense\" of Flubber is all that strong. He doesn't mention Flubbernugget except near the end of the day when emogirl123 asks him what he's going to do with his vote, and he says \"I'm not lynching Flubber, I'm not lynching PM.\". I could agree that makes him a slightly less juicy target for a Flubbernugget nightkill. I am a bit more curious about the people he spent most of the day with now, especially since he wasn't terribly scattershot, and since I really don't like TheDudeAbides's entrance to this day.<br>\n<br>\nI am trying to decide if I don't like emogirl123's play or if I think she's scum. I think her play continues to be awful into today, and I'm not sure if it's jarring because it's not coming from a town perspective, or if it's just weird. Comparing from the only other game I was in with her (NY 170: Georgetown II), her play in this game feels different, but the reaction to her feels very similar. (She was town in that game.) I definitely thought yesterday that she was more likely to be scum than Phijkchu_Magikarp, and I'm still suspicious of her. To some extent, I want to wagon her alone today given her claim so we don't risk exposing any power roles today. I'm still on the fence with her, but at the very least I wouldn't mind if she eats rope today.<br>\n<br>\nI don't want to pursue Beck today for reasons.<br>\n<br>\nJosh_B is weird to me because I totally see what all the people on his wagon are saying, and I agree with them.

Hopefully the mod won't lock the thread right before I hit the submit button this time. <br>\n<br>\nAlright Luca, let's play. I'm still trying to figure out if your scum looking for the weak link on a mislynch or another town doing the same. Your emo push holds a lot more clout seeing that PM flipped town. I don't see how it was a \"great lynch\" like emo says, but as far as D1 lynches go, it was certainly met the standards.  I agree with others that scum was likely mixed bag on that lynch.  I think it had enough town support all the way through. <br>\n<br>\nI think as scum the right move would have been getting my d2 lynch ready which gives me pause. The only real strong moves towards anyone were aimed at emo, and massive of which massive is dead. and I'm still in WIFOM if Town Luca was making such a push on scum emo and nothing else had much traction, a Luca kill could have made a strong case of scum feeling threatened, considering other possibilities of possible town that would less likely be threatened with a lynch right a way like Llama and Bookitties.  <br>\n<br>\nEven with possible Luca town making a push on emo town, the weak obscure reason for her vote makes me feel like emo is a right lynch for today, but egg's defense of her D1 makes me think there's a possible connection there. However Thesp's inclination towards protecting PR's leads me to believe that one is in play already and the massive NK was a secondary kill from a probably town vig. Unilaterally wagoning Emo doesn't make sense to me considering her VT claim.

Especially not when Phij and Massive were my top two scum reads.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nOkay, that makes sense to me.<br>\n<br>\nMy naked vote on Luca didn't attract any scum hitchhikers either, so I'm kind of at a loss myself.  Emogirl just seems like such a lazy vote, especially since she hasn't actually posted any content today.  I still don't think Beck is scum.  I'm not so confident about Lissa-town as you, but yeah, so far not scum at least.  I don't think Thesp is scum.  <br>\n<br>\nI usually feel much more confident in my reads at this point.

Going into the Newbie game linked there, my default opinion was that claimed docs should be left alive simply because it leaves the mafia in the position that they will have to kill them (if they're a real doc) or risk missing their night kill. In that Newbie game, there was a strong incentive for a Mafia roleblocker to stay alive even for just one more night, and incredibly beneficial for the town to lynch a Mafia roleblocker. It made me see that there are some games and scenarios where the risk of mislynching a doc are outweighed by the possibility of getting scum, especially a power-role scum.<br>\n<br>\nAlso given that this game doesn't have a cop we're following (who requires doc protection), and other potential power roles haven't been outed, the utility of a doc at this stage is considerably less useful (and the overall win % hit associated with losing a doc is lessened).<br>\n<br>\nI fully expect I'll be voting Josh_B by the end of the day to secure a lynch.

When I play, I <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">frequently</div> say that I'm happy with my vote. (A cursory look through my games should confirm this.) I like to be crystal clear about where my vote is and my stance with it. I am indeed reinforcing my desire to have you lynched. I also have no strong desire to re-quote everything I said about you - I feel as though my case is strong enough to stand on its own and don't want to clutter up the thread with reptitive drivel that doesn't add anything new to the conversation.

To some extent, this is expected - I'm arguing that you're scum, and you have every reason to argue that you're not (regardless of your alignment). For you then to suggest I'm ignoring you is particularly dishonest. I obviously don't think the case is terrible against you, I've stated it's the strongest scumread I have this game (and still have - I'd still rather lynch you over Josh_B, but I'd be happiest if we could lynch both of you today).<br>\n<br>\n<div align=\"center\"><hr style=\"height:14px;width:70%\"></div><br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6396284#p6396284\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=6396284#p6396284\" data-post-id=\"6396284\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 743</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=24832\">TheDudeAbides</a> wrote:</cite>I mean, I didn't hack his account.<br>\nAnd I wish that he wouldn't lurk, but when he's posted it hasn't been bad.<br>\nThose posts are examples of that.</div></blockquote><br>\nWait, I'm confused.

Having four players at L-4 isn't going to do that.  Thesp is a smart enough player to realize four people aren't. Going to vote you in the next two days. If he is town, it makes no sense for him to contribute to a no lynch. If he is scum and Josh is town, sure. Dead town doc. If he.

His overconfidence in Llama-town is not something I feel a real doctor would have, either.  I also want to know why Josh is suddenly so certain about TDA-SK, because I don't see this logic either.

I mean seriously, she is arguing that either in a single faction game scum tried to breadcrumb doctor as hard as he did that would only hold water with multiple scum factions and claimed a \"innocent\" on a partner (since remember - no matter what I am scum)... or that there are two scum factions which there has been no evidence of being true.  Regardless of either they just choose to argue with who apparently is their top suspect for a few days and then at the very end go \"oh.. deadline\" as the reason to stick the vote on Josh.<br>\n<br>\nIf Josh is town.

I think it's plausible that Josh is scum and there is a vig or an SK.  His thought process makes sense in that case.  It's hard for me to see another case in which it would make sense.  It's not optimal scum play, I shouldn't think, but I could see someone doing it, I suppose.<br>\n<br>\nI think Josh might have been rolefishing (I can think of at least two comments that looked to me like PR crumbs, and no, I'm not going to share them) as scum.  If he's doing it as town, then I have no response.<br>\n<br>\nJosh has exhibited a weird exaggeration of what information is actually available to a town doc.  <br>\n<br>\n1.  Doctors don't know if their protects are successful.  Josh thinks that he does know that.<br>\n2.  Only weak docs can tell if their targets are town.  Josh thinks he knows that.<br>\n3.  Town doctors don't know who the scum targeted.  Josh thinks he knows that too.<br>\n<br>\nJosh didn't even mention you except in passing in his first post on Day One; suddenly he was sure you were town day two.  If he's a weak doc, I could have seen that logic.  That STILL would not explain the other things, but that's not what he claimed anyway, so it's moot.  If he thought you were such a brilliant and shiny town star, Llama, that you were the obvious choice for a doc protect, though?  I have no idea why he wouldn't have said so BEFORE night fall to try to draw the nightkill to the person he was protecting.<br>\n<br>\nFinally, Josh didn't crumb day one when he wasn't under suspicion.  He crumbed day two, when he was.  Claiming doc is not uncommon as scum.  And I don't think Josh's play has been optimal regardless of his alignment day two.  He's crumbled under pressure; I find that somewhat alignment indicative.<br>\n<br>\nJosh's later comments led me to believe that he was soft-claiming that his doc claim was a gambit.  If he's town and not a doc, then his behaviour could have outed an actual doc, so the gambit is anti-town.  <br>\n<br>\nIf Josh flips scum, I guess I would consider that a towntell for you, Llama, except that your logic seems so bad to me that I can't see it coming from a sane town perspective.  Meh, I just can't see scum linking to another scum so dramatically.

You also unvoted and if town, there was never a time when your lynch would have truly benefited the town. I'm not sold that it was a town tell, but I don't see any evidence either way on it. There's also a lot of process of elimination going on considering I was scumreading phij and massive Day 1, Josh Day 2, and to an extent even Bookitty.

It's more than one post - it's a series of posts (which all stem from the first post I cited) that bother me greatly. I like some of your posting yesterday, and my discomfort of JohnnyFarrar gives me some pause (as I don't think he'd be scum with you, but I'm not keen on him). I also strongly disagree that I've only been sitting on you and doing nothing else, though I agree that's where my voting power has been.<br>\n<br>\nWe disagree on the meaning and intent behind several of your posts. That's normal, even if you do turn up to be town (which I still doubt will happen). I do think you exploring avenues other than me is productive (though admittedly I'm biased in that perspective). There may be some way of convincing me you're town, though at this point I have no idea what that would look like, because I feel the points against you are so strong.

Cute.<br>\n<br>\nSo removing the people I think or know to be town, who does that leave.<br>\nPM wagon: emo/Johnny, TDA<br>\nJosh wagon: Thesp, TDA, Luca<br>\nWho is on both? TDA.<br>\nAlso, I don't like his entry to either. <br>\nHe scumread PM for what looks to me like a large portion of D1 but only voted him as the hammer. I am a total hypocrite for finding this a little scummy, and considering that I probably shouldn't read too much into it, but whatever. Also, he didn't have a vote down at all for a while there. Why, TDA, did you leave your vote unplaced when you unvoted Luca, instead of putting it back on PM or, say, Massive? <br>\nAnd he comments on lynching a claimed doc being the wrong move then helps it happen anyway<br>\nWho is on neither? Llama. Interesting. It seems like a scum off both wagons makes a lot of sense. Based on my townreads on said wagons and some stuff. <br>\nAnd I don't think all three of thesp/tda/luca are scum, and I don't think Emo is scum, and if I am right on that, he is scum. Hmm. And I only have two non townflips/townreads on one of the wagons so if my townreads are right theres scum off that one<br>\nIf TDA is scum, likely only one of Thesp/Luca is. All three scum in a row like that on a wagon would be bizarre. <br>\nEmo's approach to the PM wagon/vote still feels town to me.<br>\nLuca and Johnny as scum together makes no sense.<br>\nIf Thesp is scum, there's probably at least one scum on the PM wagon, too.<br>\nI think scum is likely thesp/tda/llama.<br>\nLooking at llama's behavior close to pm getting lynched. It seems like llama hopped off pm close to a lynch and pushed a totally different wagon with little/no support. I mean I guess his unvote when he did makes sense kind of but not the flubber vote really. It was at a point when everyone wanted to lynch pm and a pm lynch was probable which is interesting. Could be distancing from a wagon he knew'd flip town<br>\nLlama's tda vote today is interesting. Hmm. I dont' know if a bus makes sense right now.

Cute.<br>\n<br>\nSo removing the people I think or know to be town, who does that leave.<br>\nPM wagon: emo/Johnny, TDA<br>\nJosh wagon: Thesp, TDA, Luca<br>\nWho is on both? TDA.<br>\nAlso, I don't like his entry to either. <br>\nHe scumread PM for what looks to me like a large portion of D1 but only voted him as the hammer. I am a total hypocrite for finding this a little scummy, and considering that I probably shouldn't read too much into it, but whatever. Also, he didn't have a vote down at all for a while there. Why, TDA, did you leave your vote unplaced when you unvoted Luca, instead of putting it back on PM or, say, Massive? <br>\nAnd he comments on lynching a claimed doc being the wrong move then helps it happen anyway<br>\nWho is on neither? Llama. Interesting. It seems like a scum off both wagons makes a lot of sense. Based on my townreads on said wagons and some stuff. <br>\nAnd I don't think all three of thesp/tda/luca are scum, and I don't think Emo is scum, and if I am right on that, he is scum. Hmm. And I only have two non townflips/townreads on one of the wagons so if my townreads are right theres scum off that one<br>\nIf TDA is scum, likely only one of Thesp/Luca is. All three scum in a row like that on a wagon would be bizarre. <br>\nEmo's approach to the PM wagon/vote still feels town to me.<br>\nLuca and Johnny as scum together makes no sense.<br>\nIf Thesp is scum, there's probably at least one scum on the PM wagon, too.<br>\nI think scum is likely thesp/tda/llama.<br>\nLooking at llama's behavior close to pm getting lynched. It seems like llama hopped off pm close to a lynch and pushed a totally different wagon with little/no support. I mean I guess his unvote when he did makes sense kind of but not the flubber vote really. It was at a point when everyone wanted to lynch pm and a pm lynch was probable which is interesting. Could be distancing from a wagon he knew'd flip town<br>\nLlama's tda vote today is interesting. Hmm. I dont' know if a bus makes sense right now.

I have a theory that if im right we are going to be in a great position, and if I am wrong it may give scum extra stuff if they are not seeing it.  Plus saying it would likely require us lynching today... its just not *quite* there as if one of a few unlikely things is going on its a waste.<br>\n<br>\nRealistically though I don't think that saying it today really adds much, and its not so extreme that someone else couldn't probably reach the conclusion if they think about it hard enough.  I know I have some bizarre theories at time but this isn't as out there as some things.<br>\n<br>\nIts one of those things where I still think No Lynch is the right move, but to an extent its almost a \"why bother\" because unless scum screws something up we are still in the same position as we were today just down a town.
