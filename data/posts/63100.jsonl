{"number": 1, "id": "7163987", "user": "Radja", "user_id": "26121", "content": "<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">Game Rules</div></div><br>\n(<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">stolen and modified from Empire, Tierce, Magua, and callforjudgement</div>)<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">General Rules</div><br>\n1. The site-wide rules apply. Read them, know them, love them, do not break them.<br>\n2. Play to win.<br>\n3. Do not edit or delete your posts in this thread. If there is a problem with a post, such as incorrect formatting, ask me to fix it for you.<br>\n4. Do not quote communications outside the game thread, including role PMs, quicktopics, etc., in the game thread. This specifically includes PM timestamps. Paraphrasing is allowed. If in doubt, ask.<br>\n5. Do not use cryptography, invisible text, tiny text, or the like.<br>\n6. Do not use any form of provable randomness. Claiming you rolled dice and acting on that is fine. Using dice tags is not.<br>\n7. Do not impersonate or pretend to be the moderator. If I edit a post, I will use <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:orange\">this color</div></div>. Do not use this color.<br>\n8. Unless the moderator has specifically told you it is allowed, do not talk about this game outside of this game thread until it is completed.<br>\n9. Do not bring outside factors into this game. This includes, among other things, making bets, promises of real life rewards, etc.<br>\n10. Claiming scum by yourself is fine. Claiming scum with others is not, regardless of the truth of this claim.<br>\n11. Pretending to break a rule will be treated the same as breaking the rule.<br>\n12. We're all here to have fun. Tempers may flare, but avoid personal attacks and keep it civil.<br>\n13. Breaking one of these rules may, at my discretion, result in a modkill. If you are modkilled, you will become a Neutral Survivor, and thus automatically lose. Modkilling may or may not end the game day.<br>\n14. I reserve the right to change the rules. Rule changes will be posted in thread.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Activity Rules</div><br>\n1. If a player goes two days (48 real life hours) without posting, they may be prodded at my discretion, or upon being asked by another player. Prods will be announced in thread.<br>\n2. If a player does not respond to their prod within one day (24 real life hours), is prodded three times in the same game-day, or five times in total within the game, they may be force-replaced at my discretion.<br>\n3. If you will be V/LA, please alert me in the thread or via PM.<br>\n4. Each game day will have a deadline of two weeks (14 real life days).<br>\n5. In the event deadline is reached before a lynch has occurred, there will be No Lynch.<br>\n6. Each night will have a deadline of two days (48 hours).<br>\n7. If a player has a night action, but does not submit a choice before deadline, they will perform no action.<br>\n8. I may extend deadlines in the event replacements must be found, at my discretion. This will be announced in thread.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Voting Rules</div><br>\n1. Votes must be at the beginning of a new line and bolded, and in the format of <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">VOTE: Player name</div> or <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Playername</span>. Abbreviations, missing punctuation, and misspellings will be accepted as long as it is obvious to me who is being voted for. If I perceive it as a vote, it counts as a vote.<br>\n2. Unvoting is nice, but is not necessary.<br>\n3. Once a majority of votes is reached (# of players / 2 + 1, rounded down), that person is lynched.<br>\n4. All living players, including the lynchee, may continue to post until I lock the thread.<br>\n5. If you are dead, that is it. Do not post. Not even a \"Bah\" post.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Setup Rules</div><br>\n1. At least 1 player will get the Vanilla Townie role PM, which looks like this:<br>\n<fieldset style=\"border:3px outset grey;padding:5px 10px\">Welcome, [PlayerName], you are a <div style=\"display:inline;color:green\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vanilla Townie</div></div>.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Abilities:</div> Unfortunately, you have no abilities.

I'm posting this just to show that texcat had his vote on Haschel before and seems to have forgotten about it. Also, Haschel counted this second vote of texcat as vote number 5 on him, when it was only 4 (because texcat already has his vote there).

That's my main issue.<br>\n<br>\nMaking matters worse is the fact that after I point out that he's not scumhunting (\"you should probably do something about this\"), he votes the guy i'm voting (totally fine, think he might be scum), and then unvotes (also fine, since he can have his own opinion). But once again, the same issue pops up. What does he do after he unvotes? Nothing. Sure he talks and fluffs, but where the fuck is his vote. Like i said in 124 \"a vote is the only thing townies have during the day to win. You're not using it, which is a waste of town's populationalready minimal resources. Get some reads and.put a vote down\" (wow that autocorrected population wtf).

There's a huge problem with this. What is it, you ask? He isn't doing anything. The entire town needs to work together towards lynching scum. How is unvoting a random vote and then <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">NOT DOING ANYTHING WITH YOUR VOTE AFTERWARD</div> helping us. That's my main issue.<br>\n<br>\nMaking matters worse is the fact that after I point out that he's not scumhunting (\"you should probably do something about this\"), he votes the guy i'm voting (totally fine, think he might be scum), and then unvotes (also fine, since he can have his own opinion). But once again, the same issue pops up. What does he do after he unvotes? Nothing. Sure he talks and fluffs, but where the fuck is his vote. Like i said in 124 \"a vote is the only thing townies have during the day to win. You're not using it, which is a waste of town's populationalready minimal resources. Get some reads and.put a vote down\" (wow that autocorrected population wtf). What's even worse is that he seems to have a scumread (or at least hints that he finds scummy things) but does not vote to back it up.<br>\n<br>\nNow hush up Accountant and vote him already.<br>\n<br>\nSamX and Havingfitz are guilty of the same thing.

Sure he is acting really stupid on some things, like jumping on me for a RV page 2 but that shows he has good intentions to me. <br>\n5. stoz - Another person looking fine, his last post definitely implies he is trying to get the ball rolling.

SamX - 2 posts<br>\n7. gob - Me ;0<br>\n8. vijay2vasandani - Though inactive he is definitely giving me the \"i really wish i werent here right now\" vibe.

This is changing my words.<br>\n11.) Same as 1, this sounds like a scumread but he doesn't say it. Leaving wiggle room for when opinion start flying maybe.<br>\n<br>\n10.) This is the main thing i wanted to note. Gob's only stated scumread is for \"flying under the radar\". Over half of gob's reads are \"only has x posts so can't tell\". Same reason for scumread as null reads.<br>\nGenerally his read list really just sounds like narration rather than actually comment/opinions.

Let's start with the vijaywagon.  I don't get it. At all.  VeeGee said that he didn't like his \"tone\", and gob concurred and accused vijay of \"half-assing\" his posts.  These are both ridiculous.  When I pushed gob on this point, he said \"I never said others posts were grade-A either, but i find the need to mention that Vijays in particular stood out to me as half-assed.\"  This is a complete non-answer to my question of what specifics made them half-assed.  So, <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">gob, I'll ask you again: Which specific posts by vijay do you feel were half-assed, and why do they strike you that way?</div><br>\n<br>\nThen there is Hopkirk's two attacks suggesting that vijay is coaching his partner, specifically for the lines <blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7168496#p7168496\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7168496#p7168496\" data-post-id=\"7168496\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 71</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=26170\">VeeGee</a> wrote:</cite>Anything in particular you want me to do?</div></blockquote><br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7168511#p7168511\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7168511#p7168511\" data-post-id=\"7168511\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 73</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=16810\">vijay2vasandani</a> wrote:</cite>anything really. maybe put down the most serious vote you can?</div></blockquote><br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7168540#p7168540\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7168540#p7168540\" data-post-id=\"7168540\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 74</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=26170\">VeeGee</a> wrote:</cite>I can do that.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Texcat</span><br>\n<br>\n<br>\nFeels as if he's making things up to give a reason to vote.</div></blockquote></div></blockquote> and <blockquote><div><cite>vijay wrote:</cite>Also after I asked for a serious vote, VeeGee picks texcat, retracts it and then leaves it at that. Stop doing the bare minimum scum and at least look like you're scumhunting.</div></blockquote><br>\nI think to call either of these statements \"coaching\" is an enormous stretch.  If anything, I felt gob's \"i do not think he is scum at this time (and i doubt VeeGee thinks that either\" seemed much more like possible coaching than anything vijay has said.<br>\n<br>\nMoving on.<br>\n<br>\nI noticed people have Accountant as a strong townread, which I find a little disconcerting.  In addition to another crappy case on vijay (He's aggressive!  He wanted people to vote for Haschel and then turned around and voted somebody else! Never mind Haschel's actions between those two points.  He's starting wagons!), she states that Klingoncelt is \"rubbing [her] the wrong way\" yet lists SamX and vijay as better vote options.  Now, the vijay part makes sense; her case may not be very good, but she did make one and voting for vijay is internally consistent.  But SamX?  Why?  And no reason is given.  Later she says that vijay \"seems to be deflecting more than anything\" and didn't like \"vibes\" that he was giving off.  Accountant, what was vijay deflecting?<br>\n<br>\nGob made a pretty sparse reads list, and here is his read on VeeGee: <blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7168921#p7168921\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7168921#p7168921\" data-post-id=\"7168921\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 94</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=26058\">gob</a> wrote:</cite>I think <blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7168496#p7168496\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7168496#p7168496\" data-post-id=\"7168496\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 71</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=26170\">VeeGee</a> wrote:</cite>Anything in particular you want me to do?</div></blockquote>says enough for VeeGee, he is obviously trying to appear as a town, asking what he should do, not wanting to step on any toes.</div></blockquote><br>\nThat's not a read; that's a complete dodge that makes it look like he said something about VeeGee while not actually saying anything.  So once again, let's be unambiguous here: gob, do you believe VeeGee is scum or not?

There's a huge problem with this. What is it, you ask? He isn't doing anything. The entire town needs to work together towards lynching scum. How is unvoting a random vote and then <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">NOT DOING ANYTHING WITH YOUR VOTE AFTERWARD</div> helping us. That's my main issue.<br>\n<br>\nMaking matters worse is the fact that after I point out that he's not scumhunting (\"you should probably do something about this\"), he votes the guy i'm voting (totally fine, think he might be scum), and then unvotes (also fine, since he can have his own opinion). But once again, the same issue pops up. What does he do after he unvotes? Nothing. Sure he talks and fluffs, but where the fuck is his vote. Like i said in 124 \"a vote is the only thing townies have during the day to win. You're not using it, which is a waste of town's populationalready minimal resources. Get some reads and.put a vote down\" (wow that autocorrected population wtf). What's even worse is that he seems to have a scumread (or at least hints that he finds scummy things) but does not vote to back it up.<br>\n<br>\nNow hush up Accountant and vote him already.<br>\n<br>\nSamX and Havingfitz are guilty of the same thing.

You mention sam and having as an afterthought as \"guilty of the same thing\". Why are you only pressuring veegee instead of the other two too?</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nBecause he's my biggest scumread? I know having is V/LA on weekends and the games I played with him (3 years ago) show that he ramps up when he feels like he has something to say. Sam was pretty new and hadn't posted as much.

The case on vijay, as fas as I can remember, is associative. But we have no flips, let alone the one flip you'd need for this case to work. What else was there?

It's fabulous, &amp; it isn't long, so you really should.<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><br>\nOther than the vote, no content. Vote is weak, no scumhunting, no questions.</div></blockquote>Again, my case is magnificent.<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><br>\nMentioning things like setup/quote tags/replacement requests instead of content is active lurking.

Mafia generally like to find things to talk about that look like they&#8217;re actually saying something when they aren&#8217;t.</div></blockquote>The only problem with this, is that whenever I post fluff, it's clear, I'm posting fluff.

Six content posts in an eleven-page game is eye-brow raising, I think, but can be forgiven if the posts themselves are full of good, meaty insights. Let's take a look. <br>\n<br>\n#93:<br>\nStates that Trivium's question could be town, then says that it could also be scum. Concludes that it's a null tell. This seems like he's just trying to pretend to analyze, this point gives absolutely no content and could be summarized as \"the RVS is a null tell for me\", which is hardly an amazing discovery. Votes an inactive, which is fine at that point in the game. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n#122: Took a stance on gob's reads list, even if it was a mild one like \"I don't think it shows he's scum\".

This does tell me something about his thought process, but he hasn't come up with any original ideas so far, having mostly agreed with vijay about VeeGee. I do not agree with Dessew's statement that he's been fence-sitting, commiting to VeeGee is a pretty clear indication that he's picking a side. <br>\n<br>\n#208: This to me is stoz's saving grace. It's an original idea and after reading it I felt genuinely convinced of a possible Dessew buddying Gob or vice-versa(which was only reinforced after they both agreed that each other were scum). I agree strongly with gob that his feels very townish to me.

Do you think a mafia would bus their buddy that far on Day 1. <br>\n<br>\nI've noticed that people who are under pressure tend to be able to notice a lot of scummy things about other people, perhaps because they're incentivized strongly to convince town to lynch someone else. At worst, I get more content out of a scummy, fairly quiet player. At best, VeeGee provides convincing evidence against gob, who is then exposed as scum and lynched. <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>At the time this was posted VeeGee only had four votes on him and was in no practical danger of being quickhammered, so why bring it up as a possibility?</div></blockquote><br>\nIt's a standard habit I have every time a player looks like a viable lynch candidate. Most of my forum mafia experience is from a forum where quickhammers were fairly common, especially because a large portion of the players were new to mafia. Gobln, who quickhammered in Newbie 1632, is also in the game, so I needed to put it out early. <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Did you read his reads list? It didn't have strong opinions at all.</div></blockquote><br>\nThis was my error; upon reread, I concede that the reads list was indeed not very strong. My point that scum had no reason to post an unasked-for reads list with stances taking on certain people(\"literally bare-bones stuff, just trying to get by\" makes it pretty clear what he thinks of me, for example), because it gives them less flexibility in a fluid situation like Day 1 where reads can change fast(sort of like how I went from townreading gob to VI/scumreading him).<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>These are mutually exclusive.</div></blockquote><br>\nPerhaps I wasn't clear enough. What I meant was that Gob is transparent in that he throws out whatever he's thinking off the top of his head when unprompted or given a loose question like \"what are your reads?\", but becomes evasive when someone else asks him specific, direct questions.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>If you actually think that gob is definitely not a vanilla townie, why the hell would you announce that in the thread? I can see literally no scum motivation for that. Also, if he's not vanilla, and he's only 5% a power role, then where does 40% clueless town come from?</div></blockquote><br>\nI was giving my best read on gob at that time. Perhaps you can't see any town motivation for that, but scum wouldn't have any reason to do so either(if I was scum and suspected gob was a powerful role, all I have to do is wait for night and go \"pst! let's NK gob!\". <br>\n<br>\n\"power role\" referring to a powerful role, not a role with a night ability. Cop is an example of a power role; something like Deputy isn't.<br>\n<br>\nI agree this part should have been more clear, so I'm clarifying it now.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>You've been talking me up quite a bit in this game, even in posts that supposedly have nothing to do with me. It's one thing for me to be a townread, but after a while it comes across as buddying.</div></blockquote><br>\nMy point remains. I think you're a strong player and most likely town. Look at that in whatever way you want to.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>If you are town, why do you care what other people think about you?

Same with the reads; if 5 people had responded to that post with \"I think you're filthy scum\", that would be a sign that I was doing something wrong, especially since this is my first game on MafiaScum(I played in a newbie, but had to be replaced after 3 posts). <br>\n<br>\nI fail to see how scum asking this question would make them look town.

In retrospect, not really sure why I thought she looked town here.<br>\nInitial vote on veegee (135) is based on Vijay&#8217;s post- kind of strange accountant went from 116 is null/could be town to 116 is scummy as hell. Could show lack of original scumhunting.<br>\n167- Scumread on vijay for vijay&#8217;s position on veegee despite the fact accountant sheeped that position is pretty strange/confusing if from town. <br>\n203- Claims to have scumread on Dessew yet doesn&#8217;t like me voting him. The Dessew read also comes despite 167 also saying she wanted to see more of Dessew, then nothing to really justify the &#8220;Dessew is one of my two strongest scumreads&#8221;. Also describing Gob&#8217;s reads as clear doesn&#8217;t sound right to me. Here accountant also gives a scumread on Gob.<br>\n205- &#8220;convince me to vote Gob&#8221; at veegee. Possibly didn&#8217;t expect veegee wagon to grow so fast/wants to leave.<br>\n212- This isn&#8217;t as bad as it&#8217;s been made out, I don&#8217;t like quickhammers, and I like using the day so I can see where she&#8217;s coming from. On the other hand, the &#8220;we need to lynch veegee&#8221; sounds like she&#8217;s made her mind up, despite trying to give a different impression.<br>\n244- Why is this a Gob case instead of a veegee case? This doesn&#8217;t seem to match with her prior momentum. I don&#8217;t see how Gob&#8217;s reads had strong opinions (strawman pros?). The actual numbers (using numbers) don&#8217;t really strike me as bad though.<br>\n249- Also could be encouraging Veegee again. On the other hand I don&#8217;t see this as a pairing or Accountant would have her vote on Gob.<br>\n262- Sounds rather image conscious.<br>\n294- &#8220;I've received many reasons to leave the VeeGee lynch, including the presence of more popular targets like Dessew or gob.&#8221; She could have left the Veegee wagon quite easily which makes me think they aren&#8217;t together. Claiming that Dessew is a more popular wagon on the other hand is pretty weird.<br>\n379- &#8220;I feel ready to switch to a gob lynch now since Wanderer is generating content and nobody seems willing to push on him. He's still my strongest scumread, however, and unless something changes I will probably vote him again tomorrow.&#8221; Given Wanderer has more votes on him than anyone else this makes 0 sense. It also sounds like accountant wants to make a push on a weak player as she doesn&#8217;t want to push on Wanderer.

Why is it such an issue.<br>\n<br>\nIts not like Im wagoned or anything</div></blockquote><br>\nWhy the hell would you <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">not</div> move your vote? A vote is probably one of the strongest indicators of stance out there. By voting yourself, you're making yourself unreadable, especially with your smokescreen of yelling and general troll aura getting in the way. Or, to put it in more simple terms:<br>\n<br>\nWhy are you not moving your vote from someone you believe to be confirmed town(yourself) to someone you believed to be almost confirmed scum(vijay)?<br>\n<br>\nI don't have the time to do a VeeGee ISO, but I promise I'll get it done soon. In general, I feel suspicious of VeeGee because he acted scummy on the first day, and then went utterly silent when placed under pressure, which is something I don't think people are emphasizing enough about his behavior. I do not like people who replace out when a wagon forms on them, and it invariably makes me think that they're scum who's retreating now that everything went tits-up. And the few posts he did make before he replaced failed to address any of the questions directed at him too, which makes me feel that he's being evasive, another big scumtell. <br>\n<br>\nWanderer's aggressive replace-in behavior is a null tell for me however; I can see why a town would do it just as much as scum. I still think his slot is scum, so I'm still voting him. Right now there seems to be 0 pressure placed on him, I don't see people pressuring Wanderer as actively as they're pressuring gob(which I must admit is also partially my fault), which is mildly frustrating because I sort of feel like the wagon has stalled. <br>\n<br>\n@Gob's numbers: <br>\n<br>\nI get numbers for reads as a way to quantify how I feel about a situation. A read of:<br>\n<br>\nJohn is 70% town 30% scum<br>\n<br>\nmight be expressed as \"John seems pretty town to me, I can't find any posts of his that are scummy at all\" for someone else. I keep getting asked to justify these numbers, when I'm pretty sure that if I had just posted \"gob is acting weird, I think he's scummy\" I wouldn't be questioned and voted based on it. I stand by my decision of expressing my actual feelings about the probability that he's a powerful role. If I read him as 90% powerful it would be a different story, but I don't see how it helps scum for me to say that I feel there's a 3% chance he's powerful. Nor can I see how it helps me rolefish, gob's not going to softclaim just because I suddenly posted a percentage on him.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Anyway, how do you know whether it was intentional?</div></blockquote><br>\nWhat, VeeGee <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">accidentally</div> presented a set of choices that was very obviously misleading, and which he should know was misleading? <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>@Accountant: What are you using Bayes for there?</div></blockquote><br>\nI find that expressing your feelings as probabilities and then updating them accordingly is a useful method to quantify your feelings about any particular issue.

Most meaningless or make no sense. One of the biggest things is the Trivium scumread (not voting trivium though) is for something so many other people were doing, this has never been responded to.<br>\n112- Says reads reflect opinions at the time then several more posts supporting them.<br>\n143- Now claims, after being asked a couple of qs (not by me yet) they were basically a joke.<br>\n153- This is after I question his reads and he&#8217;s back to his reads are what he thought at the time- trying to temporally disassociate. Doesn&#8217;t respond to any of my comments about him except with insult &#8220;I worry for your mental state&#8221;.<br>\n165- Not responding.<br>\n183- Asked if he thinks veegee is scum (something he hasn&#8217;t said himself) and confirms that read + talks about &#8220;all the scummy shit he&#8217;s done&#8221;. The weird bit is that he doesn&#8217;t then vote veegee.<br>\n184- Top townread on Dessew for no real reason. Gob went from &#8220;he answered my question which is cool&#8221; to &#8220;top townread&#8230; providing clarity to the game&#8221;. Progression makes no sense.<br>\n194- &#8220;I just don&#8217;t vote&#8221;. I don&#8217;t see how this can make sense from any perspective. Maybe Scum trying to fly under the radar, but that doesn&#8217;t even slightly fit with his other actions. Doesn&#8217;t make sense as any alignment, either new or wants to appear new.<br>\n234- Hasn&#8217;t even mentioned trivium despite that being a big thing I asked about yet claims he&#8217;s answered all my qs. Votes Veegee because he&#8217;s worried about appearances. The not voting logic makes no sense either.<br>\n242- Hasn&#8217;t gone through scumread (veegee) but goes through Klingon with conclusion that doesn&#8217;t match the rest of the post or the reasoning given.<br>\n246- &#8220;i can agree with you and say i havent been acting like i should be.&#8221; Really rubs me the wrong way.<br>\n256- Another instance of being asked to give a read on someone he&#8217;s barely mentioned and deciding they&#8217;re a top scumread. He isn&#8217;t looking for scum on his own, only when forced.<br>\n274- Misrepresnts my comment in a way that doesn&#8217;t seem accidental.<br>\n396- Says that saying his reads were bad= he doesn&#8217;t need to explain where they came from/they mean nothing.<br>\n414- Dice= Randomly. Klingon read still doesn&#8217;t make sense.<br>\n428- Repeatedly said up to this point he had a good townread on accountant. Restates here.<br>\n443+4- Read changed from townread on accountant to almost happy to hammer, then votes. He&#8217;s responding here to something about vidjay and accountant being scum together saying it&#8217;s an interesting catch but he doesn&#8217;t agree&#8230; then he does a 180 on one of his top reads without warning. This is insanely opportunistic. This is a really bad post.<br>\n490- Now he expected accountant wouldn&#8217;t be able to defend herself, gives impression he&#8217;s confident on her being scum.<br>\n<br>\nI should never have taken my vote off him yesterday.

Haschel's original question was worded in such a way, that it could (&amp; did) easily have gob talk about other player's in general instead of vijay. (Namely, he asked why were vijay's posts half-assed in contrast to other player's posts, or something like that.) gob didn't even mention this. He isn't self-aware enough to know what questions he was asked. I mean, the \"readlist\" would've been unnecessarily flashy if he was scum &amp; whatnot. The reason why I'm singling this one out, though, is that you cannot seriously think he would've faked it.

Looking at <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7176772#p7176772\">253</a>, I'd want attention on Stoz and Vijay for voting on VeeGee's wagon with Gob. Apparently Vijay is Not_Mafia who is claiming a role? I'm somewhat confused as to which roles and results have been truthfully claimed at this point.<br>\nConstantine was absent the entire game. When Salamence replaced in, he was a major part of turning the lynch on Accountant and opposing the lynch on Gob. That's not quite as bad as Dessew's play, I think, and perhaps not quite as suspicious as Stoz either.<br>\nTexcat, Havingfitz, and Hopkirk were all on the Gob wagon on Day One. All three subsequently moved off and on to Accountant (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7193477#p7193477\">406</a> for Hopkirk, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7196628#p7196628\">442</a> for Texcat, and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7197667#p7197667\">477</a> for Havingfitz). On Day Two, all three voted for Gob. I'd say that there's no more than one Mafia in that set. Texcat and Havingfitz have been fairly inactive but Stoz (see below) has been more inactive and with a more suspicious pattern.<br>\nStoz was inactive as well. If NM is telling the truth then Stoz is definitely on my list of suspicious characters for the voting pattern as well as for lurking without providing a vote for Gob (unlike Texcat and Havingfitz).<br>\n<br>\nAnyway, if we could have everyone who has claimed a real result to reiterate, that would be fantastic. Right now I have NM claiming Rolecop with results on Texcat (Doctor) and one other player (Gunsmith, player not yet named).", "time": "Sat Sep 19, 2015 12:55 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=63100&start=625", "forum": "53", "thread": "63100"}

If he were a town role cop, there is no effing way that he would assume that the doctor in this setup is scum.  Why would he expose the doctor if he were town?  Why would he think that the scum  needs a doctor?  Who is this alleged scum doctor supposed to be protecting the scum from?

{"number": 743, "id": "7246019", "user": "havingfitz", "user_id": "11821", "content": "OK...first things first. <br>\n <br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Not_Mafia</span><br>\n <br>\nNot_Mafia (NM), you trying to push a case on me is ridiculous.  But please....please take the time to concoct a case, since you haven&#8217;t yet, for the reading enjoyment of town.  Let's see how well you can get those creative writing skills going.<br>\n <br>\nThere is a lot to not like about NM. <br>\n- His successful push to get rid of texcat yesterday.  While I acknowledge texcat was a bit dense in his recognition that there could be benefits to having a mafia doctor in the game and of the existence of a JOAT despite the N1 NK....those didn't factor into NM's initial push.  So essentially we can thank NM for losing the TOWN Doc. <br>\n <br>\n- NM's claim has been inconsistent: 1st he claims to have <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7230881#p7230881\">tracked texcat to Klingon</a>; then <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7231097#p7231097\">he admits to lying</a>; then <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7232842#p7232842\">he says he&#8217;s a rolecop</a>; then <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7234320#p7234320\">he says he watched Klingon get visited by texcat</a>.  Why not just be straightforward and tell the truth?  NM&#8217;s posting has been extremely limited (in quality&#8230;not quantity) and much of what content there has been has either been flippant or misleading.<br>\n <br>\n- I agree with NM&#8217;s comment that <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7235971#p7235971\">&#8221;There is no way town has a Doctor, Gunsmith, Rolecop and JOAT.&#8221;</a>  I can&#8217;t recall any games I have had where there was a town Rolecop.  I can recall a few where scum had one.  And combined with the investigative powers (Cop and Tracker) the JOAT had&#8230;.I find it even more difficult to believe town had all the PRs above.       <br>\n <br>\n- Why is NM still alive?  A <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">TOWN</div> Rolecop is infinitely more of a threat to scum than a random player of unknown (if any) abilities who was also a recurring frontrunner to be lynched.  I.e. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">why NK wander-nl when there is a claimed rolecop?</div> <br>\n <br>\n- NM repeatedly cast suspicion towards me yesterday&#8230;.<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">why not rolecop me last night?  Why rolecop Slamence?</div><br>\n <br>\n- And if NM is saying <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7243394#p7243394\">Sala is vanilla</a>, how can he follow that up by saying <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7244240#p7244240\">there is scum in Sala/fitz.</a>   WTF?  Didn&#8217;t NM just say Sala was Vanilla?<br>\n <br>\nSo yeah.  I think the likihood of there being a scum rolecop is a hell of a lot more probably than that of there being a scum Doctor.  And now that NM has lead us down the path of finding out the Doc was legit&#8230;.we need to repay the favor and confirm NM is scum.<br>\n <br>\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\n <br>\nSome VCA thoughts:<br>\n <br>\nWith regard to me:  I think I have mentioned it in here...but I do not bus.  In 30+ games as scum I have only voted out a partner once and that was inevitable&#8230;.and his competing wagon was my other partner.  So no way in hell would I go to the trouble to ginning up a case on gob and vote him most of D1 when I could have easily pushed another person I suspected&#8230;.VeeGee (aka Wanderer)&#8230;who was garnering more support at the time.  Especially when gob was a roleblocker!  And then push for his lynch right out of the gate D2 leading to his lynch.  ---&gt;Anyone who thinks I am scum has their head up their ass.<br>\n <br>\nThe three main wagons D1 were gob, VeeGee and Accountant.  Everyone still alive was either on Accountant or VeeGee to end D1 so not a lot there.  <br>\n <br>\nD2 we got scum and D3 we mislynched texcat.  Those ON the gob lynch and OFF the mislynch were: havingfitz and Hopkirk.  Translation&#8230;.we aren&#8217;t scum.<br>\nPeople OFF the gob lynch and ON the texcat lynch were:  stoz and Dierfire.  In Dierfire&#8217;s defense&#8230;.his predecessor was absent most or all of D2.  Translation&#8230;.One or both of these are scum.<br>\n <br>\nTitus was not on the gob lynch (bad) and not on the texcat mislynch (good).  So VCA is a bit null atm on Titus.<br>\n <br>\nThose on the gob lynch who were also on the texcat mislynch are: Not_Mafia and Salamence.  I think at least one of these are scum and my vote points to which one.<br>\n <br>\nIMO Not_Mafia is partnered with stoz or Dierfire. <br>\n <br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">tl:dr;</div><br>\nScumpool &#8211; Not_Mafia..stoz&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.Dierfire<br>\n <br>\nHope aren&#8217;t scum &#8211; Titus and Salamence<br>\n <br>\nAren&#8217;t Scum &#8211; havingfitz and Hopkirk", "time": "Thu Sep 24, 2015 5:13 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=63100&start=725", "forum": "53", "thread": "63100"}
