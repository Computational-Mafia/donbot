{"forum": "53", "thread": "63100", "pagelink": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=63100&start=0", "number": "1", "timestamp": "Fri Aug 21, 2015 1:33 pm", "user": "Radja", "content": "<span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;\">Game Rules</span></span><br>(<span style=\"font-style: italic\">stolen and modified from Empire, Tierce, Magua, and callforjudgement</span>)<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">General Rules</span><br>1. The site-wide rules apply. Read them, know them, love them, do not break them.<br>2. Play to win.<br>3. Do not edit or delete your posts in this thread. If there is a problem with a post, such as incorrect formatting, ask me to fix it for you.<br>4. Do not quote communications outside the game thread, including role PMs, quicktopics, etc., in the game thread. This specifically includes PM timestamps. Paraphrasing is allowed. If in doubt, ask.<br>5. Do not use cryptography, invisible text, tiny text, or the like.<br>6. Do not use any form of provable randomness. Claiming you rolled dice and acting on that is fine. Using dice tags is not.<br>7. Do not impersonate or pretend to be the moderator. If I edit a post, I will use <span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: orange\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">this color</span></span></span>. Do not use this color.<br>8. Unless the moderator has specifically told you it is allowed, do not talk about this game outside of this game thread until it is completed.<br>9. Do not bring outside factors into this game. This includes, among other things, making bets, promises of real life rewards, etc.<br>10. Claiming scum by yourself is fine. Claiming scum with others is not, regardless of the truth of this claim.<br>11. Pretending to break a rule will be treated the same as breaking the rule.<br>12. We're all here to have fun. Tempers may flare, but avoid personal attacks and keep it civil.<br>13. Breaking one of these rules may, at my discretion, result in a modkill. If you are modkilled, you will become a Neutral Survivor, and thus automatically lose. Modkilling may or may not end the game day.<br>14. I reserve the right to change the rules. Rule changes will be posted in thread.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Activity Rules</span><br>1. If a player goes two days (48 real life hours) without posting, they may be prodded at my discretion, or upon being asked by another player. Prods will be announced in thread.<br>2. If a player does not respond to their prod within one day (24 real life hours), is prodded three times in the same game-day, or five times in total within the game, they may be force-replaced at my discretion.<br>3. If you will be V/LA, please alert me in the thread or via PM.<br>4. Each game day will have a deadline of two weeks (14 real life days).<br>5. In the event deadline is reached before a lynch has occurred, there will be No Lynch.<br>6. Each night will have a deadline of two days (48 hours).<br>7. If a player has a night action, but does not submit a choice before deadline, they will perform no action.<br>8. I may extend deadlines in the event replacements must be found, at my discretion. This will be announced in thread.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Voting Rules</span><br>1. Votes must be at the beginning of a new line and bolded, and in the format of <span class=\"noboldsig\">VOTE: Player name</span> or <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Playername</span>. Abbreviations, missing punctuation, and misspellings will be accepted as long as it is obvious to me who is being voted for. If I perceive it as a vote, it counts as a vote.<br>2. Unvoting is nice, but is not necessary.<br>3. Once a majority of votes is reached (# of players / 2 + 1, rounded down), that person is lynched.<br>4. All living players, including the lynchee, may continue to post until I lock the thread.<br>5. If you are dead, that is it. Do not post. Not even a \"Bah\" post.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Setup Rules</span><br>1. At least 1 player will get the Vanilla Townie role PM, which looks like this:<br><fieldset style=\"border:3px outset grey; padding:5px 10px\">Welcome, [PlayerName], you are a <span style=\"color: green\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vanilla Townie</span></span></span>.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Abilities:</span> Unfortunately, you have no abilities. However, you do have a vote. Use it wisely!<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Win Conditions:</span> You win if all threats to the town are eliminated and at least one town-aligned player is alive.</fieldset>"}

But once again, the same issue pops up. What does he do after he unvotes? Nothing. Sure he talks and fluffs, but where the fuck is his vote.

VeeGee - I think forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7168496#p7168496 says enough for VeeGee, he is obviously trying to appear as a town, asking what he should do, not wanting to step on any toes.<br>2. Haschel Cedricson - Probably my top town, he seems to be going strong and following on his own reads, unlike VeeGee who is merely putting pressure on an overall quiet, inactive player. <br>[note] im not saying putting pressure on quiet players is bad, but as i stated before i think vijay is town (for now) however, i still beg for vijay to be active.<br>3. Klingoncelt - 3 posts<br>4. Hopkirk - Town at this point. Sure he is acting really stupid on some things, like jumping on me for a RV page 2 but that shows he has good intentions to me. <br>5. stoz - Another person looking fine, his last post definitely implies he is trying to get the ball rolling. Town or not. Nothing he has said has been particular to either side.  <br>6. SamX - 2 posts<br>7. gob - Me ;0<br>8. vijay2vasandani - Though inactive he is definitely giving me the \"i really wish i werent here right now\" vibe. To me it seems like he is just forcing himself to play yet another game of mafia. <br>9. texcat - 4 posts<br>10. Trivium - Yes, probably my first scum read, he is so obviously trying to glide under the radar at this time, are you going to post something?<br>11. Accountant - Literally bare-bones. They are attempting to act like they're in the game and contributing but lets be real here, she isnt.<br>12. havingfitz - 1 post, apparently gone on weekends.<br>13.

Same as 1, this sounds like a scumread but he doesn't say it. Leaving wiggle room for when opinion start flying maybe.<br><br>10.) This is the main thing i wanted to note. Gob's only stated scumread is for \"flying under the radar\". Over half of gob's reads are \"only has x posts so can't tell\". Same reason for scumread as null reads.<br>Generally his read list really just sounds like narration rather than actually comment/opinions. His later posts are exclusivley defending the reads instead of expanding (despite the last line equalling planned expansion).<br>So...<br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: Trivium</span><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Gob</span>"}

What're your reads on him?</div></blockquote><br>This needs to be answered immediately.  Like, in VeeGee's very next post.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>SamX wrote:</cite>@Haschel: What's the specific reason??? I'm dying to know why you put your vote on me.</div></blockquote><br>In addition to completely ignoring the Haschelwagon and the events leading up to it, you ALSO ignored Trivium's RQS question, so I figured you were a good place to start getting information.<br><br>Anyhoo, there's a lot going on in this game, but I do have a few things I want to bring up.  Let's start with the vijaywagon.  I don't get it. At all.  VeeGee said that he didn't like his \"tone\", and gob concurred and accused vijay of \"half-assing\" his posts.  These are both ridiculous.  When I pushed gob on this point, he said \"I never said others posts were grade-A either, but i find the need to mention that Vijays in particular stood out to me as half-assed.\"  This is a complete non-answer to my question of what specifics made them half-assed.  So, <span class=\"noboldsig\">gob, I'll ask you again: Which specific posts by vijay do you feel were half-assed, and why do they strike you that way?</span><br><br>Then there is Hopkirk's two attacks suggesting that vijay is coaching his partner, specifically for the lines <blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7168496#p7168496\" class=\"postlink\">post 71</a>, VeeGee wrote:</cite>Anything in particular you want me to do?</div></blockquote><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7168511#p7168511\" class=\"postlink\">post 73</a>, vijay2vasandani wrote:</cite>anything really. maybe put down the most serious vote you can?</div></blockquote><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7168540#p7168540\" class=\"postlink\">post 74</a>, VeeGee wrote:</cite>I can do that.<br><br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Texcat</span><br><br><br>Feels as if he's making things up to give a reason to vote.</div></blockquote></div></blockquote> and <blockquote><div><cite>vijay wrote:</cite>Also after I asked for a serious vote, VeeGee picks texcat, retracts it and then leaves it at that. Stop doing the bare minimum scum and at least look like you're scumhunting.</div></blockquote><br>I think to call either of these statements \"coaching\" is an enormous stretch.  If anything, I felt gob's \"i do not think he is scum at this time (and i doubt VeeGee thinks that either\" seemed much more like possible coaching than anything vijay has said.<br><br>Moving on.<br><br>I noticed people have Accountant as a strong townread, which I find a little disconcerting.  In addition to another crappy case on vijay (He's aggressive!  He wanted people to vote for Haschel and then turned around and voted somebody else! Never mind Haschel's actions between those two points.  He's starting wagons!), she states that Klingoncelt is \"rubbing [her] the wrong way\" yet lists SamX and vijay as better vote options.  Now, the vijay part makes sense; her case may not be very good, but she did make one and voting for vijay is internally consistent.  But SamX?  Why?  And no reason is given.  Later she says that vijay \"seems to be deflecting more than anything\" and didn't like \"vibes\" that he was giving off.  Accountant, what was vijay deflecting?<br><br>Gob made a pretty sparse reads list, and here is his read on VeeGee: <blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7168921#p7168921\" class=\"postlink\">post 94</a>, gob wrote:</cite>I think <blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7168496#p7168496\" class=\"postlink\">post 71</a>, VeeGee wrote:</cite>Anything in particular you want me to do?</div></blockquote>says enough for VeeGee, he is obviously trying to appear as a town, asking what he should do, not wanting to step on any toes.</div></blockquote><br>That's not a read; that's a complete dodge that makes it look like he said something about VeeGee while not actually saying anything.  So once again, let's be unambiguous here: gob, do you believe VeeGee is scum or not?  What specific reasons make you feel that way?<br><br>Finally, I want to mention this quote by VeeGee: <blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7169202#p7169202\" class=\"postlink\">post 116</a>, VeeGee wrote:</cite>Are you saying that I should either, A: Keep voting texcat, even though I had no reason to, or B: Vote someone random?<br><br><br>I'm not doing either.</div></blockquote><br>This is a horrible false dichotomy and you know it.<br><br>Alright, that's a big enough wall for now.  VeeGee, gob, Accountant, please answer my questions in your next post."}

That's my main issue.<br><br>Making matters worse is the fact that after I point out that he's not scumhunting (\"you should probably do something about this\"), he votes the guy i'm voting (totally fine, think he might be scum), and then unvotes (also fine, since he can have his own opinion). But once again, the same issue pops up. What does he do after he unvotes? Nothing. Sure he talks and fluffs, but where the fuck is his vote. Like i said in 124 \"a vote is the only thing townies have during the day to win. You're not using it, which is a waste of town's populationalready minimal resources. Get some reads and.put a vote down\" (wow that autocorrected population wtf).

The case on gob is that he is a weak player. I mean, some people accuse him of that,&amp; that somehow leads to a scumread in some magical way. In the meantime, he's towning. The case on vijay, as fas as I can remember, is associative. But we have no flips, let alone the one flip you'd need for this case to work. What else was there? Some random wagon &amp; RQS nonsense, it's great that they made the game start, but it could work pretty well without me actively participating.<br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I tried to summarise what he\u2019s done without bias.

Haschel's original question was worded in such a way, that it could (&amp; did) easily have gob talk about other player's in general instead of vijay. (Namely, he asked why were vijay's posts half-assed in contrast to other player's posts, or something like that.) gob didn't even mention this. He isn't self-aware enough to know what questions he was asked. I mean, the \"readlist\" would've been unnecessarily flashy if he was scum &amp; whatnot.

It isn't long, but it also isn't good.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Dessew wrote:</cite>Here, I've found it. gob's reaction to this question doesn't match up with scum-gob. Haschel's original question was worded in such a way, that it could (&amp; did) easily have gob talk about other player's in general instead of vijay. (Namely, he asked why were vijay's posts half-assed in contrast to other player's posts, or something like that.) gob didn't even mention this. He isn't self-aware enough to know what questions he was asked. I mean, the \"readlist\" would've been unnecessarily flashy if he was scum &amp; whatnot. The reason why I'm singling this one out, though, is that you cannot seriously think he would've faked it. So stop this thing of yours, &amp; join the stoz wagon.</div></blockquote>  I disagree with your statement about my wording.  The question\"by what metric are vijay's posts half-assed, particularly when compared to the posts of half the players in this game?\" clearly demands an answer that actually talks about vijay's posts, and gob's response comes across as an intentional question dodge.  Also, your statement \"stop this thing of yours\" is weird.  Like, really weird.  For starters, I'm not actually voting for gob, and as of right now I'm not trying to convince others to do so, so I don't have a \"thing\".  And if I do, I have it with a bunch of other players.  Somebody who I'm not going to bother looking up floated the idea that the mutual defense between you two is scummy as hell, and your post does nothing but bolster that theory.<br><br>Speaking of gob:  Here's the post where Accountant flips her read on gob:<blockquote><div><cite>Accountant wrote:</cite>he started off fine with clear reads and then went on into a ramble about newbie games and how his reads are always correct.

This does tell me something about his thought process, but he hasn't come up with any original ideas so far, having mostly agreed with vijay about VeeGee. I do not agree with Dessew's statement that he's been fence-sitting, commiting to VeeGee is a pretty clear indication that he's picking a side. <br><br>#208: This to me is stoz's saving grace. It's an original idea and after reading it I felt genuinely convinced of a possible Dessew buddying Gob or vice-versa(which was only reinforced after they both agreed that each other were scum). I agree strongly with gob that his feels very townish to me. I can imagine scum!stoz writing this, but it's not as obvious as town!stoz writing this. <br><br>#232: Promises to address the rest of Dessew's post. <span class=\"noboldsig\">Remember to make a note if he fails to do this.</span><br><br>Overall read on stoz: town. #208 was a strong town post and the other two, while not exactly the meatiest of posts, had nothing overly scummy about them.

Do you think a mafia would bus their buddy that far on Day 1. <br><br>I've noticed that people who are under pressure tend to be able to notice a lot of scummy things about other people, perhaps because they're incentivized strongly to convince town to lynch someone else. At worst, I get more content out of a scummy, fairly quiet player. At best, VeeGee provides convincing evidence against gob, who is then exposed as scum and lynched. <br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>At the time this was posted VeeGee only had four votes on him and was in no practical danger of being quickhammered, so why bring it up as a possibility?</div></blockquote><br>It's a standard habit I have every time a player looks like a viable lynch candidate. Most of my forum mafia experience is from a forum where quickhammers were fairly common, especially because a large portion of the players were new to mafia. Gobln, who quickhammered in Newbie 1632, is also in the game, so I needed to put it out early. <br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Did you read his reads list? It didn't have strong opinions at all.</div></blockquote><br>This was my error; upon reread, I concede that the reads list was indeed not very strong. My point that scum had no reason to post an unasked-for reads list with stances taking on certain people(\"literally bare-bones stuff, just trying to get by\" makes it pretty clear what he thinks of me, for example), because it gives them less flexibility in a fluid situation like Day 1 where reads can change fast(sort of like how I went from townreading gob to VI/scumreading him).<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>These are mutually exclusive.</div></blockquote><br>Perhaps I wasn't clear enough. What I meant was that Gob is transparent in that he throws out whatever he's thinking off the top of his head when unprompted or given a loose question like \"what are your reads?\", but becomes evasive when someone else asks him specific, direct questions.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>If you actually think that gob is definitely not a vanilla townie, why the hell would you announce that in the thread? I can see literally no scum motivation for that. Also, if he's not vanilla, and he's only 5% a power role, then where does 40% clueless town come from?</div></blockquote><br>I was giving my best read on gob at that time. Perhaps you can't see any town motivation for that, but scum wouldn't have any reason to do so either(if I was scum and suspected gob was a powerful role, all I have to do is wait for night and go \"pst! let's NK gob!\". <br><br>\"power role\" referring to a powerful role, not a role with a night ability.

Same with the reads; if 5 people had responded to that post with \"I think you're filthy scum\", that would be a sign that I was doing something wrong, especially since this is my first game on MafiaScum(I played in a newbie, but had to be replaced after 3 posts). <br><br>I fail to see how scum asking this question would make them look town.

As for VeeGee himself, he's V/LA, so I can't really put pressure on him until he comes back. <br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>At first this appears like a good point, but it ignores one important scenario: rolefishing.</div></blockquote><br>How does this help scum!Accountant gain a better lock on gob's real role? <br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Is this standard terminology on those other forums you mentioned? gob, can you confirm/deny?</div></blockquote><br>It is standard terminology on the Town of Salem forums. This is due to the way their role lists are formatted, which gives categories of roles instead of exact roles; when \"power role\" is said, it can mean \"role that falls under the category Town Power\", which usually means the strong, town leading roles.<br><br>In <a href=\"http://www.blankmediagames.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=17&amp;t=24614\" class=\"postlink\">FM 7C</a>, I claimed power role day 1, and people still thought I was claiming town power all the way until the start of D2. There isn't really a consensus on the actual meaning of the term \"power role\" on those forums, with most situations depending on context to figure out. In this case, I feel that gob's actions could be that of a strong, powerful town role acting weirdly to discourage mafia from targeting him.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>If you're worried that other people think you are fence-sitting, then you make sure that your stance is posted unequivocally and move on.

On the other hand, the \u201cwe need to lynch veegee\u201d sounds like she\u2019s made her mind up, despite trying to give a different impression.<br>244- Why is this a Gob case instead of a veegee case? This doesn\u2019t seem to match with her prior momentum. I don\u2019t see how Gob\u2019s reads had strong opinions (strawman pros?). The actual numbers (using numbers) don\u2019t really strike me as bad though.<br>249- Also could be encouraging Veegee again. On the other hand I don\u2019t see this as a pairing or Accountant would have her vote on Gob.<br>262- Sounds rather image conscious.<br>294- \u201cI've received many reasons to leave the VeeGee lynch, including the presence of more popular targets like Dessew or gob.\u201d She could have left the Veegee wagon quite easily which makes me think they aren\u2019t together.

Why is it such an issue.<br><br>Its not like Im wagoned or anything</div></blockquote><br>Why the hell would you <span class=\"noboldsig\">not</span> move your vote? A vote is probably one of the strongest indicators of stance out there. By voting yourself, you're making yourself unreadable, especially with your smokescreen of yelling and general troll aura getting in the way. Or, to put it in more simple terms:<br><br>Why are you not moving your vote from someone you believe to be confirmed town(yourself) to someone you believed to be almost confirmed scum(vijay)?<br><br>I don't have the time to do a VeeGee ISO, but I promise I'll get it done soon. In general, I feel suspicious of VeeGee because he acted scummy on the first day, and then went utterly silent when placed under pressure, which is something I don't think people are emphasizing enough about his behavior. I do not like people who replace out when a wagon forms on them, and it invariably makes me think that they're scum who's retreating now that everything went tits-up. And the few posts he did make before he replaced failed to address any of the questions directed at him too, which makes me feel that he's being evasive, another big scumtell. <br><br>Wanderer's aggressive replace-in behavior is a null tell for me however; I can see why a town would do it just as much as scum. I still think his slot is scum, so I'm still voting him. Right now there seems to be 0 pressure placed on him, I don't see people pressuring Wanderer as actively as they're pressuring gob(which I must admit is also partially my fault), which is mildly frustrating because I sort of feel like the wagon has stalled. <br><br>@Gob's numbers: <br><br>I get numbers for reads as a way to quantify how I feel about a situation. A read of:<br><br>John is 70% town 30% scum<br><br>might be expressed as \"John seems pretty town to me, I can't find any posts of his that are scummy at all\" for someone else. I keep getting asked to justify these numbers, when I'm pretty sure that if I had just posted \"gob is acting weird, I think he's scummy\" I wouldn't be questioned and voted based on it. I stand by my decision of expressing my actual feelings about the probability that he's a powerful role. If I read him as 90% powerful it would be a different story, but I don't see how it helps scum for me to say that I feel there's a 3% chance he's powerful. Nor can I see how it helps me rolefish, gob's not going to softclaim just because I suddenly posted a percentage on him.<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Anyway, how do you know whether it was intentional?</div></blockquote><br>What, VeeGee <span style=\"font-style: italic\">accidentally</span> presented a set of choices that was very obviously misleading, and which he should know was misleading? <br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>@Accountant: What are you using Bayes for there?</div></blockquote><br>I find that expressing your feelings as probabilities and then updating them accordingly is a useful method to quantify your feelings about any particular issue. Think of it as that scene in Death Note where L goes \"there's a 95% chance that Light is Kira\". We all know the actual chance is probably not 95%, but it helps the investigation team to understand where exactly L stands on his \"scumread\"(so to speak) of Light. <br><br>@Everyone who's voting me:<br>If you think I'm scum, who would my partner be?"}

Gob went from \u201che answered my question which is cool\u201d to \u201ctop townread\u2026 providing clarity to the game\u201d. Progression makes no sense.<br>194- \u201cI just don\u2019t vote\u201d. I don\u2019t see how this can make sense from any perspective. Maybe Scum trying to fly under the radar, but that doesn\u2019t even slightly fit with his other actions. Doesn\u2019t make sense as any alignment, either new or wants to appear new.<br>234- Hasn\u2019t even mentioned trivium despite that being a big thing I asked about yet claims he\u2019s answered all my qs. Votes Veegee because he\u2019s worried about appearances. The not voting logic makes no sense either.<br>242- Hasn\u2019t gone through scumread (veegee) but goes through Klingon with conclusion that doesn\u2019t match the rest of the post or the reasoning given.<br>246- \u201ci can agree with you and say i havent been acting like i should be.\u201d Really rubs me the wrong way.<br>256- Another instance of being asked to give a read on someone he\u2019s barely mentioned and deciding they\u2019re a top scumread. He isn\u2019t looking for scum on his own, only when forced.<br>274- Misrepresnts my comment in a way that doesn\u2019t seem accidental.<br>396- Says that saying his reads were bad= he doesn\u2019t need to explain where they came from/they mean nothing.<br>414- Dice= Randomly. Klingon read still doesn\u2019t make sense.<br>428- Repeatedly said up to this point he had a good townread on accountant. Restates here.<br>443+4- Read changed from townread on accountant to almost happy to hammer, then votes. He\u2019s responding here to something about vidjay and accountant being scum together saying it\u2019s an interesting catch but he doesn\u2019t agree\u2026 then he does a 180 on one of his top reads without warning. This is insanely opportunistic. This is a really bad post.<br>490- Now he expected accountant wouldn\u2019t be able to defend herself, gives impression he\u2019s confident on her being scum.<br><br>I should never have taken my vote off him yesterday. On a reread it definitely feels like Scum play rather than new play.<br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Gob</span>"}

Funny how you only quoted a third of one point too.<br>Here\u2019s the relevant posts for context anyway.<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7175628#p7175628\" class=\"postlink\">post 228</a>, Hopkirk wrote:</cite>I really should have previewed that one.

(Namely, he asked why were vijay's posts half-assed in contrast to other player's posts, or something like that.) gob didn't even mention this. He isn't self-aware enough to know what questions he was asked. I mean, the \"readlist\" would've been unnecessarily flashy if he was scum &amp; whatnot.

Looking at <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7176772#p7176772\">253</a>, I'd want attention on Stoz and Vijay for voting on VeeGee's wagon with Gob.

When Salamence replaced in, he was a major part of turning the lynch on Accountant and opposing the lynch on Gob. That's not quite as bad as Dessew's play, I think, and perhaps not quite as suspicious as Stoz either.<br>Texcat, Havingfitz, and Hopkirk were all on the Gob wagon on Day One. All three subsequently moved off and on to Accountant (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7193477#p7193477\">406</a> for Hopkirk, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7196628#p7196628\">442</a> for Texcat, and <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7197667#p7197667\">477</a> for Havingfitz). On Day Two, all three voted for Gob. I'd say that there's no more than one Mafia in that set. Texcat and Havingfitz have been fairly inactive but Stoz (see below) has been more inactive and with a more suspicious pattern.<br>Stoz was inactive as well. If NM is telling the truth then Stoz is definitely on my list of suspicious characters for the voting pattern as well as for lurking without providing a vote for Gob (unlike Texcat and Havingfitz).<br><br>Anyway, if we could have everyone who has claimed a real result to reiterate, that would be fantastic. Right now I have NM claiming Rolecop with results on Texcat (Doctor) and one other player (Gunsmith, player not yet named)."}

But please....please take the time to concoct a case, since you haven\u2019t yet, for the reading enjoyment of town.  Let's see how well you can get those creative writing skills going.<br> <br>There is a lot to not like about NM. <br>- His successful push to get rid of texcat yesterday.  While I acknowledge texcat was a bit dense in his recognition that there could be benefits to having a mafia doctor in the game and of the existence of a JOAT despite the N1 NK....those didn't factor into NM's initial push.  So essentially we can thank NM for losing the TOWN Doc. <br> <br>- NM's claim has been inconsistent: 1st he claims to have <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7230881#p7230881\">tracked texcat to Klingon</a>; then <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7231097#p7231097\">he admits to lying</a>; then <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7232842#p7232842\">he says he\u2019s a rolecop</a>; then <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7234320#p7234320\">he says he watched Klingon get visited by texcat</a>.  Why not just be straightforward and tell the truth?  NM\u2019s posting has been extremely limited (in quality\u2026not quantity) and much of what content there has been has either been flippant or misleading.<br> <br>- I agree with NM\u2019s comment that <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7235971#p7235971\">\u201dThere is no way town has a Doctor, Gunsmith, Rolecop and JOAT.\u201d</a>  I can\u2019t recall any games I have had where there was a town Rolecop.  I can recall a few where scum had one.  And combined with the investigative powers (Cop and Tracker) the JOAT had\u2026.I find it even more difficult to believe town had all the PRs above.       <br> <br>- Why is NM still alive?  A <span style=\"font-style: italic\">TOWN</span> Rolecop is infinitely more of a threat to scum than a random player of unknown (if any) abilities who was also a recurring frontrunner to be lynched.  I.e. <span class=\"noboldsig\">why NK wander-nl when there is a claimed rolecop?</span> <br> <br>- NM repeatedly cast suspicion towards me yesterday\u2026.<span class=\"noboldsig\">why not rolecop me last night?  Why rolecop Slamence?</span><br> <br>- And if NM is saying <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7243394#p7243394\">Sala is vanilla</a>, how can he follow that up by saying <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7244240#p7244240\">there is scum in Sala/fitz.</a>   WTF?  Didn\u2019t NM just say Sala was Vanilla?<br> <br>So yeah.  I think the likihood of there being a scum rolecop is a hell of a lot more probably than that of there being a scum Doctor.  And now that NM has lead us down the path of finding out the Doc was legit\u2026.we need to repay the favor and confirm NM is scum.<br> <br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br> <br>Some VCA thoughts:<br> <br>With regard to me:  I think I have mentioned it in here...but I do not bus.  In 30+ games as scum I have only voted out a partner once and that was inevitable\u2026.and his competing wagon was my other partner.  So no way in hell would I go to the trouble to ginning up a case on gob and vote him most of D1 when I could have easily pushed another person I suspected\u2026.VeeGee (aka Wanderer)\u2026who was garnering more support at the time.  Especially when gob was a roleblocker!  And then push for his lynch right out of the gate D2 leading to his lynch.  ---&gt;Anyone who thinks I am scum has their head up their ass.<br> <br>The three main wagons D1 were gob, VeeGee and Accountant.  Everyone still alive was either on Accountant or VeeGee to end D1 so not a lot there.  <br> <br>D2 we got scum and D3 we mislynched texcat.  Those ON the gob lynch and OFF the mislynch were: havingfitz and Hopkirk.  Translation\u2026.we aren\u2019t scum.<br>People OFF the gob lynch and ON the texcat lynch were:  stoz and Dierfire.  In Dierfire\u2019s defense\u2026.his predecessor was absent most or all of D2.  Translation\u2026.One or both of these are scum.<br> <br>Titus was not on the gob lynch (bad) and not on the texcat mislynch (good).  So VCA is a bit null atm on Titus.<br> <br>Those on the gob lynch who were also on the texcat mislynch are: Not_Mafia and Salamence.  I think at least one of these are scum and my vote points to which one.<br> <br>IMO Not_Mafia is partnered with stoz or Dierfire. <br> <br><span class=\"noboldsig\">tl:dr;</span><br>Scumpool \u2013 Not_Mafia..stoz\u2026\u2026\u2026.Dierfire<br> <br>Hope aren\u2019t scum \u2013 Titus and Salamence<br> <br>Aren\u2019t Scum \u2013 havingfitz and Hopkirk"}

Consistent on veegee scumread, though this is neither updated, nor any original reasons given for it.<br>269= Accountant is \u201cmost town\u201d. 344 (after coming back from v/la) accountant is now \u201ca bit scummy\u201d because of the approximate chance of town/scum numbers on gob.346- Weird how he\u2019s changed his top townread because he thinks the attack on Gob is bad, despite claiming to be neutral on Gob. Looks like a defence of Gob, but he doesn\u2019t vote Accountant\u2026 though he says that\u2019s just because he prefers a veegee vote.<br>Never attacks gob, defends a fair amount. Tunnels a scumread without reason.<br>Replaces out as new player more likely from scum.<br>(as Dierfire)<br>Starts off by attack Dessew based on Gob interactions. <br>679 looks quite natural.<br>685- Votes Texcat. Unclear why he believes notmafia&gt;Texcat as from 679 it sounded like notmafia was a neutral read and texcat was town.<br>757 on titus didn\u2019t make sense. Still on titus and little added to the case after first post ingame.<br><br>Overall<br>Some reads look quite natural, the veegee and texcat votes are confusing. The defence of Gob in regard to accountant is really weird.<br>SamX has suspicious interactions with Gob. Based on these posts, bussing is possible with titus, but notmafia looks like he\u2019d be a more likely partner.<br><br>Interactions with Gob<br>238- Townread on Gob sort of. Says the readslist was good and specifies \u201cI am not defending gob\u201d<br>344- Read on accountant changing.<br>Interactions with Titus<br>238- Townread on dessew for \u201cconstructive criticism\u201d. This was mainly stuff like \u201cthis is how to format x\u201d, weird reason for a townread.<br>Tunnels titus upon replace in.<br>Interactions with Notmafia<br>163- Sheeps vijay on veegee vote.<br>685- Votes texcat as L1 vote."}
