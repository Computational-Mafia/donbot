Basically you can play like a Hydra, except you don't play - you just get to share a PT with a player in the game, where you can ask them why they're playing how they are and they'll try and talk you through their processes and why they play that way. I've never done that though.<br><br>I think the most useful thing I did was \"blind read\" a bunch of Mafia Championships games. Without looking at any alignments, I would read through a completed game and try to pick scum/town based off interactions. At the end of each day I'd try to guess who was going to flip what. Then for \"Night\" I'd pretend I was a cop and do fake Cop checks. I'd record who I checked and then when I'd finished reading through the game I'd check to see how accurate my reads were and how effective my Cop checks were.<br><br>Also if I ever saw players whose thought patterns I could understand or I thought were the type of personality I could emulate, I'd not their name and read through their filter and maybe even dive their games on their home forum. So I guess I've become a sort of mish-mash of good players, and I just try out a bunch of stuff and keep what works for me. It makes it easy because when I run into a situation I'm not familiar with I can refer to my experiences and think, \"okay well player X was in this situation and they tried to....\" - I can try it myself, see what happens, see why it does or doesn't work for me and what other situations I could do it. <br><br>But I really wanna stress that I'm still very new and I'd hesitantly call myself AVERAGE at the game, not good or bad.<br><br>********END FLUFF******"}

As you said scum can't adapt to the early game.. it seems to me that you both have differentiating view points that both have merit too them. Early on you can make a good scum read if there is a slip but 9/10 times you don't have that luxury. There was no major interactions before your two messages to go off and make a strong case and from what I gather Infinity was upset at how IPS posted people he thought was scummy with pretty weak reasons one of them being entirely wrong IMO. I believe infinity was attempting to scum hunt by asking his motivation behind his picks which was much more controversial than my own and had no reasoning with any of them. I feel that giving picks without explaining a little why you feel that way leads to this kind of thing because anyone can just randomly assign alignments but it takes thought to explain it out.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8210021#p8210021\" class=\"postlink\">post 234</a>, Manuel87 wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8209258#p8209258\" class=\"postlink\">post 217</a>, Infinity 324 wrote:</cite>I'm not using it to make excuses, so how is that scummy?<br><br>My reasoning is, well, reasonable for this early on d1, and IPS called it out as scumy.

They've been posting in their other games and odds are they do read this thread but no.<br><br>DGB I was mostly wanted to engage with (as opposed to hard-scumreading), given her experience but I guess not. Maybe get good insights but mostly I think a slot that potentially dangerous should NEVER be allowed to get a free pass on day 1 involvement. If she is actually that good idk but until otherwise I see every playerwith that postcount/years as a potential nachomamma. When I asked she didn't go into naomi/ips and answered me about her read on me in like a half-serious (kind of reaction testy?) way, which is still okayish if she then actually talked to me and followed it up but she just disappeared. Fluff comment on the replace and nothing done after the naomi unvote is ugh and like she doesn't feel the need to comment on 90% of the game. Unvote itself is OK but still non-committal (\"for now\" + caveat) and unexplained and because she didn't go into the read while it was up we'll never know for sure what (if any) reasoning was behind it as opposed to something that could be a retcon explanation later. ALL of that said there isn't really reads to judge and the playstyle could technically just be laziness instead but it's still annoying I couldn't get anything to read deeper into (nullscum).<br><br>Aristophanes is scum though. He reads really fake to me and the one thing which was going for him in my eyes was the depth of the naomi read (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8201817#p8201817\">59</a> -&gt; part of <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8201916#p8201916\">63</a>); usually people thinking that in-depth so early and unnecessarily/unprompted is a huge towntell, though even at that point I was wondering how he took it that far (\"It's just a few things like that which make me think \"towny.\" \" makes it sound like he has a massive multifaceted read).

You see a few of them are almost ridiculous in context or really stand out for early reads. OTOH in his towngames the townreading is dialed back a LOT and you see a lot more scumhunting focus. <br>I think what happens is when something strange/confusing happens from a player, while town are actually trying to judge align aristo since he knows it's town can afford to put the effort into explaining exactly why their town and misunderstood. I think the naomi read really is spot on and so insightful and that naomi is town (after her content) but its like aristo could come up with that read so early/confidently he never actually doubted it. This is the kind of read where I'm either a genius and he panics in scum pt or I'm a total idiot for reading this deep into ~5 posts but I'll go with the former. Along with naomi read the tone kind of bothers me (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8201776#p8201776\">57</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8202857#p8202857\">69</a>) and I think the timing is he got lazy at the traditional point where scum realize they have to start faking doing something useful (in a town position having that early townread is a big help though) but these are more minor.<br><br>Though this is kind of awkward because even though aristos probably scum (and dbg is still a promising lead) the inactivity still makes it feel like a big waste doing this, like I almost feel bad(selfish?) doing my own thing compared to everyone else. But I don't really scumread the actives (some NULLs but eh.). TBH I think 2016 lurker-lenient meta helps scum to the point where if they strategized to they could intentionally just lurk and get out the d1 lynchpool, town lynch scummiest active town, they come back day 2 active and nobody cares. Nowadays I see people so against that kind of lynch + I think there's a natural tendency to just sort what you see in front of you so null in a pool of 5 will still be top scumread. 2 of my games 2 scum players were just afk and prodded and people were literally forced to lynch scummiest looking town and it's like okay I think I understand why they used to policy lynch them in old games. But anyways!<br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Aristo</span>"}

Maybe get good insights but mostly I think a slot that potentially dangerous should NEVER be allowed to get a free pass on day 1 involvement. If she is actually that good idk but until otherwise I see every playerwith that postcount/years as a potential nachomamma. When I asked she didn't go into naomi/ips and answered me about her read on me in like a half-serious (kind of reaction testy?) way, which is still okayish if she then actually talked to me and followed it up but she just disappeared. Fluff comment on the replace and nothing done after the naomi unvote is ugh and like she doesn't feel the need to comment on 90% of the game. Unvote itself is OK but still non-committal (\"for now\" + caveat) and unexplained and because she didn't go into the read while it was up we'll never know for sure what (if any) reasoning was behind it as opposed to something that could be a retcon explanation later. ALL of that said there isn't really reads to judge and the playstyle could technically just be laziness instead but it's still annoying I couldn't get anything to read deeper into (nullscum).<br><br>Aristophanes is scum though.

You see a few of them are almost ridiculous in context or really stand out for early reads. OTOH in his towngames the townreading is dialed back a LOT and you see a lot more scumhunting focus. <br>I think what happens is when something strange/confusing happens from a player, while town are actually trying to judge align aristo since he knows it's town can afford to put the effort into explaining exactly why their town and misunderstood. I think the naomi read really is spot on and so insightful and that naomi is town (after her content) but its like aristo could come up with that read so early/confidently he never actually doubted it. This is the kind of read where I'm either a genius and he panics in scum pt or I'm a total idiot for reading this deep into ~5 posts but I'll go with the former. Along with naomi read the tone kind of bothers me (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8201776#p8201776\">57</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8202857#p8202857\">69</a>) and I think the timing is he got lazy at the traditional point where scum realize they have to start faking doing something useful (in a town position having that early townread is a big help though) but these are more minor.<br><br>Though this is kind of awkward because even though aristos probably scum (and dbg is still a promising lead) the inactivity still makes it feel like a big waste doing this, like I almost feel bad(selfish?) doing my own thing compared to everyone else. But I don't really scumread the actives (some NULLs but eh.). TBH I think 2016 lurker-lenient meta helps scum to the point where if they strategized to they could intentionally just lurk and get out the d1 lynchpool, town lynch scummiest active town, they come back day 2 active and nobody cares. Nowadays I see people so against that kind of lynch + I think there's a natural tendency to just sort what you see in front of you so null in a pool of 5 will still be top scumread. 2 of my games 2 scum players were just afk and prodded and people were literally forced to lynch scummiest looking town and it's like okay I think I understand why they used to policy lynch them in old games. But anyways!<br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Aristo</span></div></blockquote><br><br>Though does mention his lurking is mostly focused on pointing out his meta and reasoning behind the vote and the lurking doesn't seem to be the major focus of their case. in fact when I looked over the main body of astro's section nothing was said about this, its like he read the first line and represented his entire cased based on that.. and he obviously finds meta a valid voting point because at the same time he was using it to pressure me. am I just seeing things guys? or is this just town paranoia? or am I onto something?

I'd rather you just played and gave content for us to look over see your points and respond to but all your doing is stating things and not backing them up much at all. I said you might want to replace because your upset that you don't have the time to contribute to the game. and not having a member of town actively helping town results in eventual misslynch or them getting killed in another way. If your slot is a town slot I can't judge it from your play because your not being helpful, and I'd rather not kill you because of your lack of effort / time put into the game. I'm not sure if advising to replace is a fo-par but I don't desire you to be killed based on your contributions just being unhelpful to town and literally existing to defend people pointing at you or activity dodging."}

Nowadays I see people so against that kind of lynch + I think there's a natural tendency to just sort what you see in front of you so null in a pool of 5 will still be top scumread. 2 of my games 2 scum players were just afk and prodded and people were literally forced to lynch scummiest looking town and it's like okay I think I understand why they used to policy lynch them in old games.

Firstly hello new replacement Glad to have another active contributor to the town who likes talking and now lets move onto the who LQ vs RB thing; This arugement feels very emotion filled. I don't care about meta though as it can give false reads. I'm going to be netural on the entire thing, it just felt like an emotion filled battle that had no real tells. which is basically what me and slandaar are upto speaking of lets do a follow up post and continue our arugement as well."}

Scum can use that to pressure and lynch you and town can't use it at all and makes our lifes hard. This is the reason every so often I do a block of reads so that other town players can look at them and question them and I don't just post a list I go through and explain my reads on each of them so that town can track my thought process. As such all the town players (and scum players) can see just what Im thinking at any given time. and to show how much it hurts our position you need only to look at scum power roles and town ones. Cop, Tracker, Watcher are all about gaining town information while Roleblocker, Janitor and framer are all based on erasing or giving miss leading information. As town are major tools are our words and just not talking and only thinking does nothing to help your team and will make it easier for scum to single you out and lynch you later in the game."}

That slot is basically confirmed town for me. I also agree with their assessment on Infinity. Rem picked up on this, and them not knowing daytalk is a thing is totally a townslip. I've faked not knowing daytalk was a thing before, though, but I don't see Rem as that experienced. I also don't see it as a daytalk play unless the Mafia team is coordinated like all hell and has already set plans in the motion. If that's the case, we're all fucking doomed anyways.<br><br>DGB's entrance was weird to me. Questioned something, was a little awkward, didn't post again. Scumlean. Naomi's entrance was extremely worse, however. Too awkward and uncertain, as Infinity puts it. I hate how the slot questions everything, but they push nothing. That's pretty fucking scummy. <br><br>Aristo's entrance isn't terrible, and I think it's playing pretty well to their town meta. Nothing wrong there. Rask's got the same vibe, and I'm fairly sure that that slot is town. Them thinking Naomi could be town and just inexperienced is something I'd normally follow through with if I didn't already have a gut feeling that that read is wrong. Still, Rask can be town, and I'll most likely sheep them to victory.<br><br>Oh, forgot Manuel. I sort of liked their entrance, but I had to read back to double check their content since it wasn't really notable. Nevermind, looked back and it's a bunch of bullshit spewing. Manuel can be somewhat scum for that entrance. <br><br>DGB pushes on Rask for no apparent reason. Pushes on my slot when I'm clearly town. I mean, if DGB were town, they'd have predicted I'd replace in and be obvtown. They didn't, so they're scum. <br><br>Also, rb seems kind of scary. Rask says that rb massacres, and I'm slightly intimidated. Still, good fucking content. I like it. <br><br>Naomi's just saying a bunch of random shit I barely remember/care about??? Still awkward as well.<br><br>Draynth entrance pretty bad, need to look into that. rb is pretty obvious town to me. <br><br>Rask picks up what I'm feeling with the DGB shtick. Town points.<br><br>Naomi voting DGB and unvoting an hour later is a notable association that I can save for later. But, uh, they make game progressive posts which I find okay. Still gut leaning them as scum, but content wise, I can leave them off to the side as a weak town. <br><br>Slandaar's entrance felt off, but that's because I'm extremely wary of him due to the last game I played with him. <br><br>Manuel's getting better townwise, but he's too much filler, really, and not enough content this far into the game. Need something more. Something better than that. <br><br>Rask keeps saying what I'm thinking. It's pissing me off. <br><br>Infinity still a strong town along with rb. Need to see more people. <br><br>Holy fucking shit LQ's entrance was so terrible and confident at the same time that they're clearly town, just... Just really really bad town. Like, who the fuck does that. He literally said a bunch of random bullshit and got away with it. Whenever I do that, I get yelled at : (. <br><br>Rem noting the Rask thing was stupid and made me scumread him slightly more. Still a weak townread, but less of a weak townread. Like a weak weak townread now. <br><br>rb poses a good argument against Infinity, but I'm not feeling it. Like, the case in itself is good, but my gut says that Infinity's town. Nothing about their play pings me, even the comment. It seems like something Infinity might say. <br><br>Manuel hopping on the Infinity bandwagon is something I don't like. <br><br>JarJar's entrance was bad. I only see town making a move like that. He hit rb because he thought he could, and I find that scummy. I read the player as town though. A good scum player pushing a mislynch would go for someone easier than rb. <br><br>First 10 pages."}

I can tell they're feeling more at ease with the current gamestate, and it's something I'd find from town. <br><br>Slandaar's either scum or playing bad. From what I understand of Slandaar, he doesn't just play bad. Rask is pretty town in my eyes, and I don't know why Slandaar is scumreading them. He also gets pretty defensive, too. I find that scummy. Gut says this is his scumgame. <br><br>Infinity still p strong town from his content. rb made me doubt the read, but that's about it. <br><br>LQ's vote on Infinity was terrible along with the sheep. Still, I strong townread that slot. <br><br>hol6 fuck these buzzwords keep getting thrown around. <br><br>Slandaar's getting scummier by the moment. Same goes with whatever their face, JarJar, but my gut says JarJar is a typical VI. I sort of strong townread there along with LQ. Both are VI's. <br><br>Rask's case on Aristo is something I'd do (but very likely less flashy, more like just LYNCH ARISTO OR FALL UNDERNEATH MY FOOT PUNY MORTALS) if I didn't have experience with Aristo. More notably, I vigged him in a game because he was acting awkward and scummy. As Rask puts it, he reads off as completely fake. However, that's more of a playstyle thing that anything.

You see a few of them are almost ridiculous in context or really stand out for early reads. OTOH in his towngames the townreading is dialed back a LOT and you see a lot more scumhunting focus. <br>I think what happens is when something strange/confusing happens from a player, while town are actually trying to judge align aristo since he knows it's town can afford to put the effort into explaining exactly why their town and misunderstood. I think the naomi read really is spot on and so insightful and that naomi is town (after her content) but its like aristo could come up with that read so early/confidently he never actually doubted it. This is the kind of read where I'm either a genius and he panics in scum pt or I'm a total idiot for reading this deep into ~5 posts but I'll go with the former. Along with naomi read the tone kind of bothers me (<a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8201776#p8201776\">57</a>, <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8202857#p8202857\">69</a>) and I think the timing is he got lazy at the traditional point where scum realize they have to start faking doing something useful (in a town position having that early townread is a big help though) but these are more minor.<br><br>Though this is kind of awkward because even though aristos probably scum (and dbg is still a promising lead) the inactivity still makes it feel like a big waste doing this, like I almost feel bad(selfish?) doing my own thing compared to everyone else. But I don't really scumread the actives (some NULLs but eh.). TBH I think 2016 lurker-lenient meta helps scum to the point where if they strategized to they could intentionally just lurk and get out the d1 lynchpool, town lynch scummiest active town, they come back day 2 active and nobody cares. Nowadays I see people so against that kind of lynch + I think there's a natural tendency to just sort what you see in front of you so null in a pool of 5 will still be top scumread. 2 of my games 2 scum players were just afk and prodded and people were literally forced to lynch scummiest looking town and it's like okay I think I understand why they used to policy lynch them in old games.

Like is Slandaar and Manuel87 went at each other I'd likely go silent and watch trying to get a solid read on either of them until it ended or started to stall where I'd comment on what went on (this is what happens when most major arugemetns happen with me.) I like to not state anything until its at a stage I feel that inputting would aid, other than asking questions. because I feel the bigger arugements help the game progress and give better reads when/if the scum players are unaware of how they are being read at the time during the arugements."}

I thought it could compenstate for the lack of infomation we'd get from roles but the day talk would act as a limiter. 10 town - 3 scum would be more normal numbers imo but the fact that scum have day talk and our power roles are D2 makes me think that if it was 3 scum it would be too much in there favour."}

Like scum normally doesn't react like this to a single vote, no one really reacts like this to a single vote and its because this is an engagement furled by emotion that I just feel that its just indicative of town V town.

Like scum normally doesn't react like this to a single vote, no one really reacts like this to a single vote and its because this is an engagement furled by emotion that I just feel that its just indicative of town V town.</div></blockquote><br><br>Eh, you might be right but I just think there's an element of caught-for-the-wrong reasons even though he would already be pissed as town. There's no reason to continue to go on about how bad the other player is when the argument is already over, as town.

It shows some real thought behind it and I actually agree w/ alot of it.  And I just see alot of good old-fashioned towny paranoia<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Slandaar</span> - Town.

I started off here w/ strong townread but kept downgrading it as I kept reading the ISO.  I will usually lean town on an emotional shitting up of the thread cause scum doesn't want to attract too much attention. But there's some pretty awful posts here. And like, he acts like a good player but he has to realize how anti-town is attitude is here.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Manuel87</span> - null. Man his scumreads are so bad.  Other than that I think he seems to be scumhunting and interacting in a town manner.  need more here.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">LicketyQuickety</span> - Null slight scumlean.  Just like RB, my read here reversed the further into the ISO I got (though it went scumread to null).  My original reasoning in 282 still stands.  Though I kinda feel like scum would defend their position there instead of just backing down.  Don't like how he chose slander to sheep seemingly out of nowhere and he really doesn't have many reads for how many posts he has (readslist was meh).  Other than that, his interaction w/ RB reads slight town to me.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Raskolnikov</span> - slight scumread. Jumped on Naomi, then said that he thinks scum are in the inactives which are contradictory points.  Agree w/ the points kraska made.  Feel like his \"I want to establish a townbloc\" is disingenuous since there's no reason he should think that people would accept his as town.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">MariaR/Rem</span> - scum.  All of Rems posts seemed scummy to me.  Marias posts are LAMIST.  Her infinity vote is terrible.  LQ vote feel opportunistic. Especially since she was \"fairly sure\" one of RB/Infinity was scum.  The fact that she hasn't reevaluated Infinity makes me fell like she just decided that she should scumread him and is looking for reasons to justify it.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Iprobablysuck/Killthestory</span> - Scum.  Probably DGBs scumbuddy.  He keeps telling us he's scumreading DGB but makes no attempt to get him lynched.  Instead he finally throws a vote @ LQ, who he's been townreading most of the game w/ no explaination. terrible.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">DrippingGoofball</span> - scum. Already posted about the contradiction in his RB read.  Other than that he hasn't done jack shit this game.

I dislike there style and even at this late in the game they are just voting and doing stuff with no contribution // Reasoning for us to look at or into. This might be a cleaver scum strat to sit back and post every now and again without content or it could just be noob scum.  There is slight shade tossing though Its subtle..<br><br>Fire Assassin (repl. rb): That engagement with LQ was just too honest to not be a town on town fight it was deeply personal and Its something I cannot see a scum player doing.<br><br>hiplop (repl. Aristophanes*): Having started with some good content at the start of the game they entirely vanished later on. This makes me think they wanted to get a soild townish cred early on and then skirt the rest of the day which seems pretty suspicious. Combined that with what Rask said and him pretty much admitting he was playing to his scum meta makes me believe that this slot is very much a scum slot. and the new guy coming in and RVSing at this stage in the game seems tasteless like; If new people are coming in at this stage there is SO much to go on that I at least expected a cursory effort. This reeks of someone who doesn't care who gets lynched right now and its that kinda attitude that makes me think there scum.<br><br>Infinity 324: Reading through they always look like there scum hunting, asking questions and gives theories and enjoys digging into peoples reads. Additionally they kept there cool under pressure and thats seems like a townie thing to be doing. Im glad my read on them was reaffirmed. <br><br>JarJarDrinks**: This one surprised me, I was expecting to go back and read there stuff like; there is nothing really happening here, but nope I was wrong and there was stuff just widely spread and small little comments, They look much better in my eyes than I expected though Still only enough to be nearly townish neutral. only major thing was vanishing for 400 posts or so which is starting to look like active lurking, but there you go.<br><br>Killthestory (repl. Iprobablysuck*) Here is something controversial I looked over the ISO from both ISP and KTS back to back and .. I'm not really seeing where this train came from? Its like; IPS commented on the 3 man train on me early game and that suddenly got everyone on there backs until they was replaced. his replacement then took the time to read and do a play by play of his reading of the start of the game, but the train kept on them. Only thing that is motivating me to vote is there improper use of language and talking like a 16 year old douch\u00e9 (also his last post was a load of shit, but thats neither here or there as they dont really have the motivation to continue.)<br><br>kraska77 (repl. Draynth*) Yeah they seem alright to me definately been putting in some effort and I like there explanations and how there veiws sometimes don't conform with the game as a whole. Disagree with there picks though so yeah.<br><br>LicketyQuickety (repl. SavageDestroyer): That engagement with rb was just too honest to not be a town on town fight it was deeply personal and Its something I cannot see a scum player doing. (Yes I did just copy this part)<br><br>Manuel87: yeah Im pretty sure there Scum at this stage, Looking over there stuff. They jumped on the infinity bandwagon when it looked like that might happen then did the same when he noticed weakness in myself. At that stage he was reading me as town until Slandaar posted my meta, and then he voted me when I refused to comment on stuff that was ages old. Then there is all the missleading things I mentioned in my first conspiracy vote. It seems to me that Manuel is looking for weakness and then jumping on it like a wolf and then says stuff to make them look worse.  Like he has been voting me for nearly 400 posts because of meta bearing in mind my last town game he is basing this off of is a; Jul - Aug 2013 game so about 3 years old.<br><br>MariaR (repl. Rem*) I mostly read them townish because of rem's activities before they vanished they seem kinda confused and uncertain so I'm town inclined with them but still not a strong read, if it wasn't for rem's activity they would be neutral still.<br><br>Raskolnikov: They have well thought out and insightful posts I'm pretty sure there town at this stage, so yeah.<br><br>Slandaar: Not wanting to ISO this one, so sticking with how I feel right now. I feel they might be town but there playstyle conflicts a lot with my own so its hard to grasp them fully and I still don't like how they play. <br><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8237235#p8237235\" class=\"postlink\">post 867</a>, rb wrote:</cite>You can't seriously expect me to sit here and get lied about and then accept that the player who is knowingly lying about me, then sitting back taking shots at my reactions, is a town slot.</div></blockquote><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8203510#p8203510\" class=\"postlink\">post 103</a>, Infinity 324 wrote:</cite>reading games blind is very very helpful since playing games takes a long time, and it allows you to adapt your scumhunting strategy and learn much quicker<br><br>PEdit: do your best naomi.

As you said scum can't adapt to the early game.. it seems to me that you both have differentiating view points that both have merit too them. Early on you can make a good scum read if there is a slip but 9/10 times you don't have that luxury. There was no major interactions before your two messages to go off and make a strong case and from what I gather Infinity was upset at how IPS posted people he thought was scummy with pretty weak reasons one of them being entirely wrong IMO. I believe infinity was attempting to scum hunt by asking his motivation behind his picks which was much more controversial than my own and had no reasoning with any of them. I feel that giving picks without explaining a little why you feel that way leads to this kind of thing because anyone can just randomly assign alignments but it takes thought to explain it out.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8210021#p8210021\" class=\"postlink\">post 234</a>, Manuel87 wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8209258#p8209258\" class=\"postlink\">post 217</a>, Infinity 324 wrote:</cite>I'm not using it to make excuses, so how is that scummy?<br><br>My reasoning is, well, reasonable for this early on d1, and IPS called it out as scumy.

After a ton work of work I can post my findings. May this be glorified in postgame or, alternatively, go down as a story of hubris.<br><br>First was going over my townreads. ReISOing.<br>infinity and Manuel I am positive are town. Btw, that infinity lynch isn't happening, ever, he's basically an alternate me in how he analyses this game.<br>LQ, kraska, and MariaR(rem) I'm 95% on now. LQ's a bit wild but what I said earlier still mostly applies. His read/case on infinity I heavily disagree with but like manuel the approach is town. Kraska's complicated but the gist of it is the only thing that stops me from being positive is there's a tiny chance she's played an amazing scumgame and faked townanalysis on a nachomamma level, which is rare and she's probably the only townread here capable of faking it all entirely intentionally. MariaR(rem) is also complicated, I get a ton of tone and emotional towntells and it's similar to how naomi was but just not quite as good, with some meta check. Even saying this though I don't think any are realistically scum; below the other 2 doesn't actually mean weak in this context. Just that inf/manuel are even stronger.<br><br>I will go into a specific read if required but going into all of them would end up 500+ words, spam the thread and most importantly probably doesn't even change people's minds on x read. I know at this point expressing this kind of townread confidence comes off as somewhere between naivety or excessive pride or arrogance, but it can't be helped. I've done this before on smaller scales with decent results though hopefully I get to use this as an example going forward.<br><br>The rest of the playerlist are potential scum. Jarjar's pretty null altogether and I think he could fake this level of play without problems. Slandaar townread I mostly overvalued one specific attitude and I kind of ignored him because he pushed the same as me yesterday. Rb(FA) might the best of this bunch as his earlygame and impetus was still good but rereading the LQ exchange (plus that weirdness \"I refuse to vote my scumread because another scumread is on it\") I can't put him solid town. DGB's probably scum as is hiplop(aristo) via that slot. Admittedly it's annoying hip came in because I can't really read him personally.<br><br>That's a pool of 5, with 10 combinations of teams. Now one of my favourite things to look for are \"negative\" associations. Finding things which suggest people could be scum together is well and good but not so good in accuracy, but interactions that I'm positive scum don't do I can feel good relying on (similar to townhunting vs scumhunting imo).<br><br><!-- l --><a class=\"postlink-local\" href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?t=67805&amp;f=2&amp;st=0&amp;sk=t&amp;sd=a&amp;user_select%5B%5D=1752&amp;user_select%5B%5D=28086&amp;user_select%5B%5D=27725&amp;user_sort=Go\">viewtopic.php?t=67805&amp;f=2&amp;st=0&amp;sk=t&amp;sd=a&amp;user_select%5B%5D=1752&amp;user_select%5B%5D=28086&amp;user_select%5B%5D=27725&amp;user_sort=Go</a><!-- l --><br>First thing I feel really good about ruling out is FA(rb)/DGB. I could go more into this if necessary, but rb seems genuinely interested in DGB during d1. <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8227971#p8227971\">614</a> stands out and I also don't think rb's approach on dgb around this time (ctrl-f DGB in the ISO for efficiency) is how scum defend scum. Notably it looks DGB voting slandaar actually influences what rb does in a way that wouldn't makes sense for daytalk scum. I kind of want to just assume rb is town for this even but I'd feel it might be careless, rb following townself logic might still be able to do this and I haven't seen his offsite body of work, but at the very least I can rule this one out. Technically also rb himself being less likely scum than the others makes me more comfortable ruling this out. FA himself and fa/dgb post replace is kind of inconclusive but it doesn't destroy or take anything away from the rb stuff. Unfortunately even though both voted slandaar I can't find any negative association I feel very strongly about there especially as the wagon was unlikely to go anywhere; rb with slandaar seems eh though.<br><br><!-- l --><a class=\"postlink-local\" href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?t=67805&amp;f=2&amp;st=0&amp;sk=t&amp;sd=a&amp;user_select%5B%5D=25129&amp;user_select%5B%5D=15569&amp;user_select%5B%5D=23679&amp;user_sort=Go\">viewtopic.php?t=67805&amp;f=2&amp;st=0&amp;sk=t&amp;sd=a&amp;user_select%5B%5D=25129&amp;user_select%5B%5D=15569&amp;user_select%5B%5D=23679&amp;user_sort=Go</a><!-- l --><br>This isn't as strong but I think hiplop(aristo)/jarjar is very unlikely. Mainly from <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=8256557#p8256557\">1466</a>. It's actually really interesting, jarjar essentially was looking at hiplop's games with DGB to compare it to hiplop's interactions with DGB here. I don't think it's definitive ruling out dgb/jarjar, as scum could have motivation to setup an association here especially considering how DGB looks, but scumjarjar doing this to scumhiplop is almost inconceivable. It doesn't make hip look good, why would scum jarjar casually cast doubt on hip if they're scum together like this? If it's to open up bussing if hip gets lynched it's incredibly creative, and the only other reason would be in some weird way if they tried to push the reverse angle on this if DGB is town and give hip credit. But it makes no sense. Jarjar in general is among the better of this 5 but his scumgame onsite really impressed me and I know he has a lot of offsite exp so I don't feel safe ruling him out. I've seen him meta here and in town games often but not in that scumgame (<!-- l --><a class=\"postlink-local\" href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?t=63716&amp;f=53&amp;st=0&amp;sk=t&amp;sd=a&amp;user_select%5B%5D=23679&amp;user_select%5B%5D=0&amp;user_select%5B%5D=0&amp;user_sort=G\">viewtopic.php?t=63716&amp;f=53&amp;st=0&amp;sk=t&amp;sd=a&amp;user_select%5B%5D=23679&amp;user_select%5B%5D=0&amp;user_select%5B%5D=0&amp;user_sort=G</a><!-- l -->); but common sense says even if he would employ meta as scum it would either be to discredit town, defend a partner or maybe rarely bussing. But this usage kind of accomplishes nothing if they're s/s.<br><br>Just ruling those 2 reduces it to 4 teams, which I've sorted through reading FA(rb) and jarjar individually as more likely town than the others. There's other interactions but I don't feel any of them are strong enough to rule things out like the above.<br><br>Hiplop(aristo), Slandaar, DGB &lt;- my pick<br>Slandaar, Jarjar, DGB<br>FA, Hiplop, Slandaar<br>FA, Slandaar, Jarjar [very unlikely]<br><br>Now there's a few things here. Even though his ISO isn't that bad either one of townreads is wrong(probably not), one of the negative associations is wrong (very doubtful), or slandaar's scum. Given he's not been THAT involved and very experienced I can definitely see him playing this way as it. Looking at slandaar again is kind of worrying though since there are a few things I pickup which are usually towntells for me. Looking at his meta though I see similar as both unfortunately, altogether he looks really good with scum and I don't think I can reliably read him. Don't really know if DGB/slan is beyond distancing; watcher claim is actually the kind of the thing slandaar would tell a scumbuddy to do(looking at pts). Slan talking with rb is ehh, slan is like tying to get him to play better which is usually a VI thing but could maybe come from scum being annoyed their partner is playing like that? Rb engages the discussion so slan was kind of required to say something back, and because of that it doesn't necessarily have to have serve any purpose beyond being a response. Doesn't seem interested in reading him through their engage.<br><br>One thing I feel safe assuming is about slandaar's play around the hiplop(aristo) case I made; I think that if slandaar is scum that reaction only makes sense if aristo(hiplop) is as well (not vice-versa though, hiplop scum doesn't have to be with slandaar). I think slandaar did look and give attention to the case and if asked would have brought out examples why. But I don't see why as scum he would go there for an innocent. Unless it was intended as buddying or to get towncred somehow, but indirectly buddying the lurker is a weird goal to have and even doing that I don't think he'd bother going that far. It'd have been buddying an inactive and soon to replace slot, or defending for towncred something unlikely to get lynched anyways, both I really doubt happened.<br>If this is assumed, take away 2 more (the jarjar teams, because of rb jarjar thing) leaving 2 teams. I also doubt slandaar/FA based on their interactions although I'm not 100% ruling that out.<br>Slandaar looking at DGB meta otoh I don't think the same applies, DGB is very possibly a lynch and distancing/bussing via meta like this is possible. Especially convenient if you come back to it on like d3 and try to take towncredit then.<br>But at this point I'm not convinced slandaar is 100% scum; I don't think I've made a mistake in talking about associations but it's possible one of my townreads is wrong. I draw the line at the 3, with it being conceivable one (just one though) of kraska/lq/maria are wrong. Accounting for this and dividing into 2 scenarios, depending on slandaar's alignment.<br><br>Slandaar scum:<br>Hiplop(aristo), Slandaar, DGB &lt;- #1<br>FA, Hiplop, Slandaar &lt;- #2<br>Hiplop, Slandaar, Mistaken Townread &lt;- #3 [feels very unlikely that both DGB and FA are town over one of the townreads though]<br><br>Slandaar town:<br>Hiplop(aristo), Mistaken Townread, DGB &lt;- #4<br>FA, Hiplop, Mistaken Townread &lt;- # 5<br>Mistaken Townread, Jarjar, DGB &lt;- # 6<br>FA, Mistaken Townread, Jarjar [negligible? would require DGB and hip both being town over one of my townreads, plus FA and jarjar BOTH being scum when they don't look that bad]<br><br>Organising again, these feel most likely<br>Hiplop(aristo), Slandaar, DGB &lt;- #1<br>Hiplop(aristo), Mistaken Townread, DGB &lt;- <br>FA, Hiplop, Slandaar &lt;- maybe<br>FA, Hiplop, Mistaken Townread &lt;- eh<br>~Kind of doubt 3/6 though.<br><br>Now the thing is, I'm not actually sure what now. Lynching hip is probably the best although the process of wagoning itself won't get much from V/LA and considering that it's hiplop. WRT DGB the idea of testing the watcher is kind of intriguing even though she's probably scum and it likely does accomplishes nothing anyways (if she's town maf probably roleblock or something). Slandaars scum unless I'm misreading a townread but I'd feel more comfortable with hip or dgb because speculation aside I at least feel my individual scumreads on them. Jarjar and FA don't even look bad they just haven't proven they're town (which will technically be harder now because of pointing this out like this).<br><br>Bright side is even if I'm wrong on one or two things just lynching in the pool is still game winning barring a catastrophe. Also even if I'm not alive or can't follow through on this approach later it'll be very interesting to look at this from postgame perspective.<br><br>Obviously, these points will be contested. More likely the reads than the association talk. But at the very least some of the association ruling out we can probably agree on, and anything specific it's easy to talk about now."}

The transition from \"let's lynch DGB\" to \"here are some reasons vedith is scum, let's lynch vedith\" is unnatural. The normal town reaction if you're unsure is to think about it for a little, and make a decision.<br><br>It's worth mentioning that vedith has claimed cop to get a town PR lynched before, but this feels very different. Given how towny kraska was, and how scummy DGB has been, and jarjar's frantic attempt to save DGB, I think we should just lynch DGB today. I ~guess~ we could wait until tomorrow to sort it out, but scum could lay on some WIFOM with roleblocking (and in fact, I think DGB might be the roleblocker).<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8265052#p8265052\" class=\"postlink\">post 1761</a>, Raskolnikov wrote:</cite><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: DGB</span></div></blockquote><br><br>How many votes are we at?<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8265069#p8265069\" class=\"postlink\">post 1766</a>, Slandaar wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8264809#p8264809\" class=\"postlink\">post 1736</a>, JarJarDrinks wrote:</cite>Unless I'm missing something, here's what I have for claims:<br><br>DrippingGoofball - PR (Watcher)<br>Firebringer- VT<br>hiplop - ??????<br>Infinity 324 - PR<br>JarJarDrinks - PR<br>LicketyQuickety - VT<br>Manuel87 - PR<br>MariaR - PR<br>Raskolnikov - VT<br>Slandaar - ??????<br>Vedith - PR</div></blockquote><br>Way too many PR claims if this is accurate but then 1 of DGB/Vedith is scum (DGB) so that is one.

As such, it's inevitable that scum would have some power roles that aren't particularly useful for them and serve only to help them make more realistic fakeclaims. (DGB's role in particular was intended to give scum clues as to what would be safely fakeclaimable, but she ended up dying before she could use it.) Actually, we probably mildly screwed up with Maria's role; Tracker would have been so weak for town in this setup (almost negative utility) that in retrospect it should have been read as obviously scum.<br><br>I probably should have thought more about the double Doctors during review. It was pretty much inevitable in a setup like this; Doctor's not a role that has a high chance of hitting under normal circumstances, and there's more than one player who might reasonably need protecting overnight (several players had confirmable roles that could have been claimed). As such, the duplicate Doctors weren't much of a red flag for me, although I should probably have allowed for the possibility that there'd be no setup speculation experts in the town who could figure that out.<br><br>Also, I'm surprised that the setup can be considered scumsided when two of town's strongest power roles died D1 and N1 (Killthestory had a Friendly Neighbour shot, there's no way you should be lynching that D1), and yet town ended up having three tries to find the last scum. I was very worried I'd accidentally made it too townsided while watching the game, but Maria did well to make her way through to the end."}

Don't like how he chose slander to sheep seemingly out of nowhere and he really doesn't have many reads for how many posts he has (readslist was meh).

It can't be balanced without changing the sitemeta. You can change this by adding setups like this to the meta but when you do that the first few will run hugely scum favoured until towns get used to it.<br><br>So, you are either trying to shift meta for what reason I don't know which is terrible and you should probably announce it to ensure some games don't run 80/20 or so. Even then your setups are not going to be balanced just based on the fact you are removing counterclaims (which is very protown) from the meta when all previous setups are based around using games within the counterclaiming meta.<br><br>I mean really. <br><br>Perhaps you didn't see the difference between 2 docs and 2 neighbourisers but now you should. As I say they are different they might be 'power' but only one of the roles can be used to balance setups properly. 4 Millers 4 Neighbours is what? 4 docs 4 trackers is something. Again if you had a setup with 4 millers 2 cops then people can deduce both cops are town, if you have 1 cop, 2 doc, 1 (scum) tracker, 1 watcher, 1 vig or whatever people are going to lynch the docs it's really obvious that is what happens which is why you wouldn't have the same setup but with 2 trackers one of which is town..."}
