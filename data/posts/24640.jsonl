Hi! I'm the mod. How's it going?<br>2. Everything written by the me will be in <span style=\"color: #0040BF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">blue</span></span></span>. No other text in post messages should appear in blue. If you post anything in blue (other than your signature) it will be edited to a different color, and a player may be mod-killed if they are pretending I wrote it.<br>3. You may paraphrase communications you have with me. Directly quoting anything I wrote to you is prohibited, and a player may be mod-killed for doing it.<br>4. If you need to get my attention on a matter, you can post in the thread in <span class=\"noboldsig\">bold</span>, or send me a PM.<br>5. As the mod, I am always right and often accurate. If you see me mess up, please let me know.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Posting During Day, Night, and Twilight</span><br>6. During the day and twilight, surviving players may only discuss this game in this thread. All other communication with other players is prohibited.<br>7. No small, invisible, or encrypted text.<br>8. Once I lock the thread and declare night, you may communicate with other players only if your role PM explicitly says you may.<br>9. If you are killed or lynched, you may make one short \"bah!\" post.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Voting and Lynches</span><br>10. Only votes that are in bold and appear substantially in the format <span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: That Guy</span> will be counted.<br>11. Unvotes are optional, but if you do it also must be bolded.<br>12. A lynch occurs when a player receives a majority of possible votes (half the number of the surviving players rounded down plus one). Once a player is lynched, the game enters twilight and no further votes or unvotes will be counted. Night occurs when I declare the lynch and lock the thread.<br>13. You may vote for no lynch. If a number of these votes make it impossible to secure a lynch by the above-stated majority, the day will end without a lynch. This is half the number of surviving players rounded up.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Deadlines</span><br>14. Days (including the first) will have default deadline of two weeks. A day deadline can be extended one week by player request.<br>15. Nights will have a default deadline of 48 hours, or 72 hours if any part of the night will occur over a weekend. A night deadline can be extended 24 hours by player request.<br>16. If a day deadline passes and no one has a majority of votes, the day ends with no lynch. If a night deadline passes and you have not made a night choice, you will take no night action that night.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Activity</span><br>17. If you will be V/LA for more than three days, please post in bold or send me a PM.<br>18. You are expected to post at least once every three days. If you do not, I will send you a prod, which you must respond to by posting in this thread within 48 hours. If you do not respond to a prod, or have to be prodded more than twice, you will probably be replaced.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Ok, Let's Get Started</span><br>19. In addition to these rules, all site-wide rules apply.<br>20. Very soon, if not already, you should have received a role PM. This game is SEMI-OPEN, which means I will reveal all of the roles that can possibly be in this game. This is NOT a promise regarding role distribution, for instance a role may be completely absent from the game or there may be copies of the same role. This IS a promise that any role not listed here will not be part of the game.<br>21. Please PM me to confirm (this may be the 3rd time you've read that).<br>22. Good luck, and have fun!"}

He then proceeded to completely ignore my 103, continuing to refer to me as Village idiot. There's no town-sided reason behind attempting to reduce the credibility of another player's posts, it only makes it easier for him to make me look like weak town in the mid and late game. If Zar was town, why wouldn't he simply paint me as town, rather than use the damning indictment of the label 'Village Idiot'.<br><br>Also, if I have a scum read, fuck yes I am going to vote them, regardless of whomever else is voting.<br><br>EBWOP: Well at least you've responded to my question: You're belittling my future arguments by reducing any crediblity I'm garnering from my actions now. By doing so, you make me look weak as a player, and unable to contribute anything of worth, or any reads that are likely to be accurate. That is anti-town play. For what reason would a pro-town aligned player seek to label a player (regarded by several as being likely to be town) as a village idiot other than to weaken people's trust in that player's ability? The term itself shows that you think I'm town-aligned, yet you're showing contempt for my arguments, dismissing them as crap. Disagree by all means, but don't try to say that belittlement on such a public scale is anything other than scummy as fuck.<br><br>The timezones question was aimed at generating discussion, and at the least it shows a modicum of trust between players. I'm happy for people to know when I should be active, I'm happy for people to know when to expect a post from me. Why would anyone not be happy with this? It's not a true scumhunting tactic, since some people will undoubtedly be unhappy with sharing their timezones and hours of activity, but the division of opinion on the intent behind this question got us out of RVS, which is only a good thing.<br><br>And with memes, it's a game that's designed for enjoyment.

You can misrep someone even if you quote them (as I believe he did) by only picking out the bits that support what you say and leaving out everything else that would contradict your case.

To clarify my position, if it wasn't already crystal clear, I think delta is not a vi. This is why I thought zar calling him one was weird. I would have used my own words to respond to it, but found that bacde had summarised my sentiments almost exactly.<br>I'm not really sure what the issue is that you have with this part of my post?

I'm asking because it's helping me generate a read on Zar, furthermore it's helping me determine what logic he's using to generate town and scumreads.

That's total bull, and misrepping what I'm doing.  As town, I'm looking to generate both townreads and scumreads. The more townreads I have, the better, because it narrows down the pool of scum to choose from; duh.  I have no idea how you're inferring that I'm trying to gain sheep by calling people town; you don't back this up with any examples, instead you point to a quote, and say 'dur, no critical thinking'.  This is false.  <br><br>When you quoted me, I was referring to theadmiral.

No shit.  What does that have to do with your case on me?

I can think of an example:<br><br>In one game setup I was playing on Epicmafia, we were at 5-way lylo with 2 clears and 3 of us claiming townie (when there was confirmed only 1 townie left).  Needless to say, me and my mafia partner (who were both claiming townie) were both very nervous.  One of the clears asked us what our reads were before they were going to lynch between us, and my partner said \"Bacde is my townread\".  He said that his role-counterclaim was his townread.<br><br>This statement doesn't make any sense from a town mindset, and was obviously said because my partner was in a different mental headspace than a townsperson (my partner ended up getting lynched).  Likewise, scum will often make similar mistakes where it just seems like they aren't figuring things out how they should if they are town.<br><br>Remember: Town are looking at everything trying to solve the mystery.  Scum aren't trying to solve a mystery, and are just looking at other posts to see if they can act as though they are scummy.  If it seems like someone is just trying to make other people look scummy without thinking things through, then they have a scum mindset, and are likely scum."}

Most of his suspicions come from stuff that happened within the first few pages (i.e. delta's timezone question, my mocking of absta's questions to delta). He also doesn't explain why he thinks zar is scummy based off his read to page 5. He also doesn't explain why he thinks orc is scummier than rev due to their exchange, or why I'm scummier than zar. He also doesn't like it when people use town or scum motivations as tells (what? that's like the best way to catch scum?!). He also doesn't explain why delta is town...<br>Actually his catchup post is all around terrible.<br>scum<br><br>delta - would have said he was town earlier in the game but his jump on me looks like shameless bandwagoning.

I don't see why you're bringing up RVS in a scum-argument like 15 pages into day 1, and Om later on said that it was my lack of reason and talk with absta that got us out of RVS. I don't see why you felt it necessary to say that I am coming off as defensive. Absta took words out of my mouth and misrepresented me and that is why I responded in the way I did.

In defense of absta's point, when he started debating the matter with you no one else had made an RVS vote without any reason.

I don't see why you're bringing up RVS in a scum-argument like 15 pages into day 1, and Om later on said that it was my lack of reason and talk with absta that got us out of RVS. I don't see why you felt it necessary to say that I am coming off as defensive. Absta took words out of my mouth and misrepresented me and that is why I responded in the way I did. Is there something wrong?</span></span> <span style=\"color: green\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">What I\u2019m saying is is that you were getting unnecessarily defensive off a RV. That\u2019s my opinion. Is that a misrep too? Absta made a reasonable assumption which at least got you talking.

I disagree with this assessment. All my predecessor did was call it fishy. Then in a completely seperate line he said other than that (other than his observation towards Bacde) he had no definitive reads. Is \"definitively fishy\" a tell? And at the bottom of page 2 I see nothing wrong with thinking someone's actions towards our lone confirmed townie could be construed as suspect. When I first read Bacde's post 36 I took it as joking but if others didn't....so what. You look to be pushing a case that has no meat. (Not OK) <span style=\"color: #800000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Uh. No. Do you understand what the word <span style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;\">otherwise</span> means? \"No definitive reads <span style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;\">otherwise</span>\"?</span></span> <span style=\"color: green\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">You\u2019ve ignored my comment above and focused on semantics.

OK\u2026.so what is your case on Sibelius (/Bitmap/me) then and now? Saying someone looked fishy halfway through page 2? How definitive a read should someone have halfway through page 2? And how many definitive reads should someone have halfway through page 2? That\u2019s the best you\u2019ve got?</span></span></span> <span style=\"color: #800000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Lol. Your \"view\" of what Sibelius said. I'm not saying anything that Sibelius didn't say himself. You seem to lack the grasp on the basic function of the word \"otherwise\" in his post, which implies that he did have a definitive read. This is not up for question. Nobody should have any definitive reads halfway through page 2, which is why it's incredibly suspect that he gave one.</span></span><br><br>Then you go on to say to Rondar that you only pay attention in RVS to the reasoning of the votes...despite the fact you gave none yourself. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif\" alt=\":?\" title=\"Confused\"> (contradictory...i.e. suspect)<span style=\"color: #800000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">How is that contradictory in any way whatsoever?

Unless Ztife is a complete moron, there is absolutely no way qwints is his buddy.  I might hear arguments for qwints being 3rd party, but there is no way scum-Ztife forgets he is voting his buddy and then defends his buddy without checking where his vote is.  Inb4 WIFOM.

Why does scum defend anyone??  Ironically, I think YOU are reading too much into this.  Ztife fucked up and forgot what his reads were.  Scum are MORE careful around their buddies.

I've already explained this earlier...there is no \"suddenly\" wrt to my actions towards mastin. When he was ZONEFACE he was a non entity (ie no read). I also have had suspicions towards others so he has not been a suspect to me (as ZF or mastin) for that reason as well (i.e. POE). I have thought he has made some good posts but I do disagree with any suspicions he has towards me or town sentiment he might have towards orcinus. I don't get why you are trying to create a scenario that doesn't exist. In summary...I think mastin is making a solid effort at finding scum and for the most part I think he is making sense. But of course that doesn't mean I am going to mindlessly sheep him and I will disagree with anyone who has any suspicions towards me or town feelings towards those I do suspect. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_idea.gif\" alt=\":idea:\" title=\"Idea\"><br><br>My read on ThaD; he was probably my next main suspect D1 after orcinus but his posting has gotten better IMO and along his Ztife interactions towards the end of D1, he has dropped a bit. Null leaning scum. <span class=\"noboldsig\">Also, I never said I agreed with most of mastin's reads; and who are you to decide that I think mastin is a strong townread?</span> I do have a townread on mastin but nowhere do I state that and I typically would not state that unless the situation warranted it (ex. a wagon building up on a \"strong townread\"). If mastin thinks qwints is town...then yes...at the moment I would disagree with that (for reasons provided <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4643726#p4643726\">here</a>). You are barking up the wrong tree AP. You really are crap at reading me.<br><br><a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4644170#p4644170\">@AP again...</a>where do I say all of mastins reads are good? I said he was doing well and for the most part that I have found his content reasonable. Even thinking someone is being reasonable does not indicate agreement. Someone can make a reasonable argument that someone else is suspicious or townish but just because I think they are being \"reasonable\" doesn't mean I agree with them. And compared to ZF, mastin is doing well.<br><br>@qwints...you never really answered/addressed my questions of how I had gone to your scummiest player in such a short period of time. Why? And is your <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4644239#p4644239\">case on me</a> really just the lack of intereaction between Ztife and I? If not...please explain. I also like how in your spoiler on Ztife's activities that he <span class=\"noboldsig\">attacks qwints (171/221)</span>, <span class=\"noboldsig\">calls orc + qwints scummy (221)</span> and then 4 pages later <span class=\"noboldsig\">defends qwints from a vote by Rev (322)</span>. Ztife's turnaround towards you is more suspect IMO than interaction levels. Have you ever used interaction levels successfully in scumhunting?

He is keeping options open for popular wagons (Zar-&gt;Qwints-&gt;Fitz) and dropping them when the people are under less suspicion (Zar/Qwints).  I think Ztife panicked and decided to bus in response to pressure.  Admiral's immediate vote onto Ztife looked really forced.  Frankly Ztife was scummy before that and Admiral only waited until Ztife drew him into the spotlight but then IMMEDIATELY voted him.  And ya Admiral is saying he is prone to buddying now (and by extension then, also OMGUS) but I think hes throwing that out there to justify his place on the Ztife wagon."}

HTF is that not scummy people? ZONEFACE was a complete non-entity at that time (and most of D1 I might add) and orcinus is trying to get people off of Ztife (one of his top 2 scum reads) and on to ZONEFACE. He's not even trying to get people on to me. And that is it for orcinus's contribution wrt Ztife on D1. So how can anyone coming after me for MY interactions with Ztife be so blind to IMO even more damning (and infrequent) Ztife commentary from orcinus?"}

Which group of players typically looks more suspect when a player is mislynched....those on the mislynch wagon or those off it? For the majority of people...especially those who like believe in VCAs...being on a mislynch is baaaad. So when I ask ThAd if he is afraid to be on the mislynch that is where that comment is coming from. Read my explanation more slowly if it's still not sinking in.

The water is there horsey...now drink it.<br><br>And the who activity thing with regards to Ztife is really annoying. I do not interact or comment on everybody everyday in every game. I commented on Ztife as much as I felt the need to and your view that orcinus's interactions with Ztife was \"definitely not 'more damning'\" and \"CERTAINLY not 'more infrequent.'\" is in the first case...an erroneous and narrowminded opinion on your part and in the second part factually inaccurate. So stop talking out of your ass and if you are in fact town....really look at what I'm saying and see if it is not in fact accurate. Because it is. Orcinus has 3 posts where is discusses Ztife. The first one he drops Ztife in (out of the blue seemingly) as one of his two acknowledged suspects. The 2nd post he tries to deflect Ztife votes to me...and the 3rd post he tries to deflect Ztife suspicions towards ZONEFACE. So 3! references to Ztife. How the fcuk is that not damning and how the fcuk is that more references than me (ME! who didn't even join the game until page 12 (or 13)?<br><br>I gave my opinion of Ztife in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4621407#p4621407\">Post 336</a> - no read yet.<br><br>I gave my opinion of Ztife again in <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4628277#p4628277\">Post 404</a> - replace him...he's done shit all to contribute to the game.<br><br>In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4630683#p4630683\">Post 435</a> I say Rev's case has me more suspciious of Ztife and that I would support in order these wagons: orcinus&gt;ThAd&gt;Ztife&gt;....TBD???......No Lynch.<br><br>In <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4630931#p4630931\">Post 441</a> I note that Ztife is at L-1 (something qwints failed to do when he voted him) and ask him if he has a claim.<br><br>So that is both more refernces to Ztife AND more willing to see him go than orcinus who referenced him 3 times that I can see and tried in two of those references to deflect atention away from Ztife.

Consider how fast the Ztife wagon flew.  Absta101 voted it followed immediately by me and then Bacde.  Rondar comes in and makes a prod-dodgy post, then catches up and we get this (and he votes Fitzy):<blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4623339#p4623339\" class=\"postlink\">post 357</a>, Rondar wrote:</cite>@Ztife Well... why don't you propose we do something instead?

I am, but I haven't been reading too thoroughly. I just read Post 351 as well as I was supposed to, and yeah, there you actually get off Revenus a bit, so... I suck. Blech. My bad.<br><br>So that easily makes Ztife the lynch imo. UNVOTE: VOTE: Ztife</div></blockquote><br>with no real reason provided, he slaps vote number four on Ztife despite not really mentioning Ztife.  His vote is justified with \"oops, my Fitz vote is bad, ya OBVIOUSLY ztife is the right lynch\"...really?<br><br>Why was Ztife so obviously the right lynch to Rondar who was ignoring him like a boss before that? (Don't over think this one)<br><br>2. Admiral connections.  Admiral defends him by attacking Zar.  Admiral now votes Rondar despite Fitz being the larger wagon and is other scumread (like fitz said, why would admiral avoid a larger wagon on a scumread?)  I guess thats a more compelling reason to vote Admiral really, but eh.  Oh, and they both suspected Fitz at the same time.  Plus Rondar had a brief flit with voting Admiral but then left it for Fitz immediately.  Feels like distancing whilst trying to steer wagons to Fitz.<br><br>3. He did it.  He killed the people.<br><br>P-edit: I'd be prettttty shocked if there were no SK in the game.  Given that the setup is semi-open (not usually or ever really done in mini normals) there must be SOME reason for it.  The SK role is pretty non-normal and I think people would start rioting if on like N4 suddenly a bunch of people died and the town lost.  So the only way to but that role in the game is to make it semi-open so people can anticipate it I guess.  So I think the setup is open because KJ wanted to make an intersting SK variation but fully closed would rustle to many feathers.  THAT being said, I also bet there is a cop in the game because the SK can choose investigation immunity.  Why have that be a choice otherwise?  /wifom /setupspec /scumpost."}

While his posting has been sporadic, I feel like his reads make sense. He's also consistently had more town reads than scum reads, and hasn't been afraid to go against the grain or be the first on a read. Looking at <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4623339#p4623339\" class=\"postlink\">357</a> followed by <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4625014#p4625014\" class=\"postlink\">367</a>, it's hard to see a reason for the sudden hop onto the ztife bus.<br><br>At 357, ztife is the leading wagon with 3 votes while 3 players (ThAdmiral, me, HF) have 2 votes. HF was also briefly voted by Revenus. So I can buy the HF vote in 357 as an attempt to create a leading counterwagon given that there's hope that Revenus comes along. On the other hand, he moves me from scummy to null and doesn't mention ThAdmiral which seems to limit his options.<br><br>The following posts are quite critical of Rondar's 357 - with HF, absta and revenus chastising him for not reading adequately. Absta doesn't buy the HF case and ThAdmiral leaves the HF wagon for a lone delta vote. <br><br>What I would expect scum-Rondar to do in 367 is test another counter-wagon to ztife - either ThAdmiral or me. Instead, he declares ztife the lynch without providing himself any outs (unless questioning ThAdmiral on his criticism of absta counts.) Then in 369, conf-town absta get off the Ztife wagon, although he lists the lynch as ztife or HF in his next post.<br><br>Today, he's pushed for both HF and ThAdmiral lynches, but got off both. If ThAdmiral's scum, Rondar's quick jump to the HF wagon I started looks bad but otherwise, it looks quite town to me. <br><br>The biggest thing I don't buy about ThAdmiral's case is attacking Rondar for slowly building to the attack on him. All of those posts except 1 took place after the Ztife hammer and the 1 wasn't very much of an attack. There were lots of other names being floated for the day 1 lynch besides Ztife and rondar never bit. <br><br>tl;dr - there's a few things that could support rondar being scum, but overall I just don't see it. I think Rondar's much more likely to be town than mafia."}

I had a tiny gut scumread on him at that point so I just flinged the vote on him. His reply nullified the only real reason I had for voting him, so I unvoted, feeling rather stupid (to reply to anyone who'll say 'why do you need a reason?', I say: 'The tiny gut scumread wasn't enough to vote him, especially after feeling it had gone down the drain').<br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic\">THEN</span> I voted Ztife who had been my other soft scumread. I literally had no one else that I suspected and thought I'd vote him for pressure, since Zar said I should try pressuring more (well, he said it while aggressively scumreading me, but that's what I got of it). Now <span style=\"font-style: italic\">that</span> is why I said 'easily'. And in response, and I absolutely hate how everyone is ignoring this, Ztife makes <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4630594#p4630594\" class=\"postlink\">Post 428</a>. Now, read that post again and tell me how, in a world where I have no other real scumreads, that isn't supposed to scream 'I'M SCUM, LYNCH ME!!!'? First of all, he team-scumreads me, Revenus and ThAd which is just bad. Really bad.

I meant that the ability to kill 3-4 people on one night is atypical for a SK, ESPECIALLY in a normal game.  I dont know if its actually non-normal, but its certainly weird enough that it could blindside people quite heavily and I think the setup is open for that reason.  Which is why I strongly believe there is an Arsonist because I just can't see otherwise given the openness of the game and the relevant flavor.  (Ya, I just used flavor to justify my setup spec. Kill me.)<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Kill spec</span>: Ok, so I just finished a scum game in Theme Park and my team and I focused on NKing strong leaders regardless of their reads or how lynchable they were.  Revenus WAS a strong leader and could have been killed for being unpredictable and being able to swing wagons.  And really no one had a scum read on that slot.  He was obvtown and possibly a PR and was definitely a wildcard.  He makes perfect sense as an NK.<br><br>THAT said, I could see Fitz killing him more than anyone else, but I'm not comfortable with that.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Xisi</span>: I agree with Bacde here pretty much.  Deltabacon was playing like he didn't care what people thought about his slot, being (somewhat) aggressive when he was around.  His OMGUS was just a part of that picture.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Who is le scum</span>?: I'm not liking the Orcinus compromise.  Whoever called it that is right.  I feel like Vifam is voting ORcinus for lack of a better wagon (correct me if Im wrong).  Bacde, who would your dream lynch(es) be at the moment?  Rondar's Ztife vote is really bad as Admiral pointed out.  He admits to Ztife being a weak read at the time but that doesnt match what happened.  He ignroes Ztife (calls him odd I guess), votes Fitz, and shortly after calls Ztife the obvious lynch after Fitz responds.  I think the speed of the Ztife wagon hit him and he realized that Ztife was going to go down and no one was really a good CW seeing that the Ztife wagon had some strong vocal supporters on it (me/Bacde).  Seriously, you don't try and go against the flow when that happens.  Side note: Bacde, what was your Fitz read at that time?  I could go look, but.<br><br>Not feeling Admiral right now.  Post 898 reads really town to me (buddying attempt successful : P)<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">About Fitz</span>: I really really want Fitz to be town.  My gut tells me he is stepping on too many feet and putting in too much effort to be scum.  He's tunneling Orcinus, but thats a null tell.  The NK spec _could_ point back to him.  After reading Zar's 915 I reread <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4649161#p4649161\" class=\"postlink\">800</a>.  Kind of agree with Zar here.

In post 357 he said of qwints: \"To those asking why I never voted qwints (Zar and orc, among others): I really didn't find his one scummy-ish post to be convincing enough for a vote\". If he had flipped on this stance he would have been called on it for contradicting himself and would likely have eaten rope for such a clear example of it. He had hardly mentioned me at all, so once again a move to my wagon would have been awkward. He probably could have gotten away with it but, like I said, he could have feared being called on it. I also think you underestimate how much traction that wagon was building up. It was fast and it was being pushed by the \"leaders\" of the game.<br>Other than that sometimes you just do stuff that people don't expect you to do as scum. I remember once in a really small game (like 7 people game) I played a few years ago, where I only had one scum partner, I tunnelled the shit out of my partner day one until he was lynched and then rode the wave of near-confirmed status to win the game (it was more complicated than that, but that's the gist)."}

This is inferring (as you have been so happy to jump up and down about) that Sibelius in fact did have a definitive read on bacde and as his stated read was \"lookin fishy\"...that definitive read you are harping on about is in fact a definitive \"lookin fishy\" read.

It opens up the possibility of a no lynch if you can split the town which is the worst possible Day.

(Maybe earlier, but that's when I know the idea was in my mind for sure. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\">) And this morning, I got inspired, with some ideas on how to format it. Typically, I tend to avoid cases longer than a paragraph, but my HOPE is that the case I'm beginning work on now will be structured in such a way that people don't really care that it's longer. With luck, it'll still be concise and clear enough that I don't even need spoiler tags. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\"><br>'Course, I'll provide a summary all the same, for those too lazy to look it over.<br><br>This case will likely eat up enough time that I might not finish it today. Need to do the research, organize my stuff, address people in terms they understand, tweak and edit the message, revise it, proofread it, evaluate it and eliminate from it anything I don't actually believe (that's a biggie <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\">), limit redundancy (except when used for emphasis), highlight the important stuff, make sure it's readable, acknowledge the opposition I'll receive, and such.<br><br>(Note--the case will be just on Xisi's slot, so \"Why is this bad for Xisi, but not for X?\" will not be included in the case. If the case itself is not persuasive enough, then I'll do a followthrough and explain my stances on the other players and why Xisi is the optimal lynch in comparison.)<br><br>And if at all possible, make it fun to read. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\"><br><br>(Am I biting off more than I can chew, it's possible, but I really don't think that I am.

Well that's sort of my point - either the arsonist sits around doing nothing and then suddenly explodes and wins the game, or he sits around doing nothing and then dies, achieving nothing. There's no obvious middle ground.<br>Once again I think the role could work well in a completely open setting because the fact that you know that if you haven't caught them by night 4 you're fucked adds a good deal of tension.

Since you're not seeing my offense, what exactly am I supposed to do? Chime in every three days, say \"still working on my Xisi case\", and let the suspicion on me mount?<br><br>Screw that.<br><br><br>There is no scum motive in stalling, because it's counterproductive. Pretty much every. single. damn. time. I've been lynched as scum, it's been at least partially for this view of me stalling. No, seriously. Outside of a hydra, that's the NUMBER ONE THING which has caused my lynch when I'm scum. It happened in GvE, CvL. It happened in Mafia on Werewolf Island. It happened in <strike>Batman and Friends</strike> DCU Mafia. It happened in Flash Mafia 3. (In fact, that was the reason I got hammered!) It happened in every single scum game I had on Mastin, from Boost Mafia 2 to Emerald City to OhGodMyHamlet. (Or was it OhGodMyVillage? Whichever of the two I was scum in. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\">) It has been the primary cause of not just most of my scum lynches, but a huge number of my town lynches as well, this bullshit about scum stalling.<br><br>So as you can imagine, I know not to do it. I'm sick. and tired. of hearing people accuse me of it. Never. not once. Have I done so for strategic value. It has never been planned. Not as scum, and certainly not as town. Always. So don't give me that crap about there being scum motive in my having stalled. There isn't any. What there IS plenty of, is me biting off more than I can chew, and catching flak for it. So if you think my ambition makes me scummy, go press that. Go press that I'm lazy. I just got lynched for it (AP can verify), so surely it wouldn't be that hard to use it as an excuse to justify a wagon on me.<br><br>But drop that stalling BS now.<br><br>In theory, it could have scum motive, in that it could make it so that people drop you off of their radar while they wait.<br>In practice, they never, EVER do. If anything, every day of \"stalling\" is another day their suspicion GROWS, rather than shrinks. It doesn't work as a scum tactic at all.<br>In theory, it could have a scum motive, in that you push the case right next to deadline, not giving people enough time to process it. It makes it so that the lynch either fails (so you can save it for tomorrow) or is rushed (as people don't have the time to pick it apart).<br>In practice, this only makes it look bad. (See also: what Xisi did just before night, shining suspicion onto Zar.) The player catches flak for the late case, and it's dissected overnight.

Two are completely different things. You can be pushing a lynch yet \"stalling\" a case, you can be chugging out case after case yet still not be pushing a lynch, you can be stalling AND not pushing a lynch, and you can be not-stalling while also pushing a lynch.<br><br>The two may have some overlap, but they're not even close to the same concept. You can push a lynch without a case. You can create a case without pushing a lynch.

Been there, done that, stop saying it in your ignorance. I have reasons for switching unrelated to mafia. mastin2 was the original version of my username on the forum it originated from.

At the time I signed up as Mastin, it was just another random forum which I thought would be good practice for the mafia games we were running on the site where I'm mastin2. Yes, it's a lot more than that to me now. Just because I'm more attached elsewhere doesn't mean I'm not attached; I can't leave this site even if I wanted to, as mafia has become part of my soul. But to really know me, you have to understand that aspect of me, that mafia--while influencing my life severely--has not dominated it. This is emphasized much better in mastin2 than it was in Mastin.)<br><br>I'm much more comfortable as mastin2. It's the name I originally had, and it fits me better. Plus, it's got a lot of symbolism. The fact that mastin2 was created on my one-year scumday has--and always will be--proof that this story isn't made up; the switch was always planned. It's like Demon Hybrid into Matias. Same scummer, different username. The name \"Mastin\" felt like it wasn't me; the name mastin2 IS me.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4697402#p4697402\" class=\"postlink\">post 1157</a>, havingfitz wrote:</cite>mastin...you've been promising a case on Xisi for awhile.

TOTALLY legit stalling because of the clicky-pen reference</div></blockquote> Cut the crap, Bacde. It's really ticking me off that you think that there's any sinister motive behind my actions. You know me well enough to know I get distracted, that I slack off, that I am busy with life, that I lose motivation for playing sometimes, and it shouldn't take a genius to figure out that combining all of these factors combined don't make for a good case-building environment. You can't see the town motive, but you're delusional if you see scum-motive.<br><br>I can throw out a BS case in half an hour. There's plenty of scummy-as-hell content from Xisi's slot. Not only that, but I don't get worried-nervous. Excited-nervous, all the dang time. My heart beats at over 2 beats per second (yes, I've timed <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\">) when I get really into the moment. My hair rises, I get goosebumps, and adrenaline rushes through my body. When passionate, I speak from my overflowing emotions. And doing that...I could whip out a Xisi case in two hours, tops.<br><br>But it'd be horribad, and I'm sick and tired of that. I've done it before. Too many times. I've done it almost every game, in fact. Thrown together some BS, and let it pass as my case. Watched as it was either ignored or nitpicked to death.<br><br>Not this time. I'm going to spend the time and effort to make it a good case, not some BS of a case.<br><br>I'm making the damn case, but I'm not going to make it to the detriment of my real life, which takes priority over my mafia live. I'm also not going to make it to the detriment of my activities elsewhere, since they are at least as important as this game.<br><br>So if you think I'm mafia for my bad habits, come on. Attack me for it. Flat-out TRY to get that pushed through. I dare you. You'll see a side of Mastin you haven't seen before--a side which is SERIOUSLY. TICKED. OFF. that you're attacking the person, not the player.<br><br>Or shut up, drop it, and let me do my work."}

Even though the innocent town slot has been useless it is still useful just by existing.

It's possible bacde/ap are scum but I really don't think so. If so well played, you will probably win. Orcinus probably deserves some more scrutiny, but xisq/mastin are better options for now.

His Ztife vote was incredibly awkward and reeks of a last effort ditch for towncred.  His Fitz case on D2 based on Revenus dying was really sketchy.

Lately it seems you get nowhere without bashing people's heads in.<br><br>tl;dr, threatening and forcing is the way to go nowadays. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\"></div></blockquote> Short-term, yes. Strongarming your way through a lynch by threatening people and forcing yourself onto them aggressively and arrogantly will get you listened to, for a phase or two. The earlier in the game, the better. People think you're good, so they follow you.<br><br>Long-term, though...if you don't have the results to back it up, they'll turn on you. They'll either ignore you even if you're right (reverse-7-for-7; you were wrong before, so you're wrong now), or call you scummy for pushing mislynch after mislynch--justifiably so, as looking at an overall picture and seeing a player consistently push mislynches is a decently-strong way to find scum more often than not. They'll realize that you never really had any solid reasoning to push said mislynches, either. You just forced them through with your attitude alone.<br><br>And any hope you have of being listened to is lost.<br><br>That's why in the long-term, you can't afford to strongarm. People need to see you came from a good spot for why you pushed that mislynch. They need to see that you had good reasons, reasons which could have been right but were proven wrong. They need to see you addressing how you were wrong, and why THIS time you're right. You need to have that persuasiveness. Though it's not impossible to strongarm your way through, it's incredibly difficult. Even if you suddenly switch tactics from arrogant strongaming to reasonable negotiation, your previous strongarm tactics are going to make you look suspect, and furthermore, you'll catch attention for the sudden switch in tactics.<br><br>Hence, why it works really well short-term, but in the long-term is incredibly self-destructive. I've been in enough games to know that most town players don't really think that far ahead. The arrogant and abrasive players expect to be dead within a few night-phases, so they don't really anticipate living long enough for their tactics to be a problem.<br><br>However, far too often, they DO live long enough for the town's paranoia to kick in, at which time, they've lost all semblance of credibility and will no longer hold as much influence over the game. Their short-term thinking means they didn't anticipate this hurdle, and now they have an uphill battle for the rest of the game to convince people they're still town (as they were originally seen as blindly), and convince people they're right (as they were originally seen as blindly).<br><br>Hence, why some long-term thinking is a necessity. If you start persuading (not forcing! not shoving your read down their throats! Legitimately persuading!<sup>^1</sup>) them from the beginning, you only get stronger as the game goes along. You'll start out weaker than those who strongarm through lynches, but over time, you'll just get better and better. People will see you've been trying to reason since the beginning, and the scum will take notice. Even if you're completely off your base, you're a threat, because you're showing solid logic and the ability to successfully negotiate, whereas a strongarm player shows very little ability to change.<br><br>In today's meta, scum can just bluntly target whoever they please, and get at least some following if they strongarm their way through. So what can a town player do to distinguish their strongarming from scum strongarming? It's not impossible, but it's incredibly difficult, as you're fighting against the very nature of human psychology.<br><br>So, the best strategy is to adapt a new approach. My suggested approach, of persuasion, of negotiating and convincing them with solid reasoning rather than throwaway pieces scattered across the game and bluntly threatening people, is the best way I can think of. It's not impossible for scum to do, but it's much harder for scum to do. <br><br>Basically--strongarming is easy for scum to continue for the whole game, but gets much harder for town.<br>Negotiating is hard for scum to continue for the whole game, but gets much easier for town.<br><br>Five years ago, it was of course vice-versa, with strongarming being town and negotiating being scum. But the site meta's shifted so drastically to be the opposite of that, into what I described above.<br><br>And quite frankly, I think the site would be better-off returning at least partially to the good ol' ways. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\"><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: 116%;\"><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">1</span>:</span> Essentially, look at the difference.

Heck, I closed the notepad with the case in it because quite frankly, I expected to be dead come morning. If the scum somehow do not include Xisi, it'd be the perfect way to frame him. The No-Lynch would be incentive for the town to lynch him (see also, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Legacy), and MANY players have said emptily (oh hey, that's actually a word! <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\">) that one of {Xisi, Mastin} has scum; killing me would therefore be material to lynch Xisi.<br><br>If the scum include Xisi as I believe they do, they could use the exact logic above to point out why Xisi <span style=\"font-style: italic\">wouldn't</span> be scum. They could claim I died to frame him. All the while, they'd have gotten rid of the primary advocate for his lynch, and with the driving force behind it dead, and with the WIFOM they'd be able to invoke, chances would have been quite high Xisi would live for a minimum of just today.<br><br>Hence, why I didn't so much as bother to touch the Xisi case overnight. <br><br><br>My lack of death, however, only reinforces my conviction. It's no secret that I doubt myself as town.<br>A lot.<br><br>Like, seriously, a lot. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\"><br><br>They could expect me to think that my lack of death means that I'm wrong about Xisi. I've done that MANY times before. (Sometimes erroneously, sometimes justifiably.) Furthermore, they can expect my death to incriminate Xisi, and if the town doesn't buy their wifom, Xisi would end up dead. As an added bonus...there's always the chance that Xisi wins the 1V1. I'm a charismatic player when I want to be, but generally, my charisma relies on me being a strong-arm arrogant player forcing my reads down your throats.<br><br>That's worked decently in the past, sure, yeah. And if you continue to press this bullshit that I have no case, I will. But it's a bad habit (like walls were a bad habit), one I am trying  to break. So don't push me, ThAd. You've seen me as scum; you KNOW that even as scum, I can (and do) make cases on any player regardless of how valid they look to you, because you KNOW that as scum, I never press something I don't believe in. Which means you KNOW that as scum, I can (and do!) put together a case when people accuse me of having none.<br><br>Like, seriously. I did it in Mafia on Werewolf Island. I did it in <strike>Batman and Friends</strike> DCU Mafia. I did it in GvE, CvL. I can't really think of a scum game where I <span style=\"font-style: italic\">haven't</span> done it, to be honest. I don't remember which of those you were in, but I'm pretty sure you were in at least one or two of 'em, so you'd see and KNOW this. It goes deeper than meta. It's been a fundamental part of my personality, since Mastin, which has carried over into all my games as mastin2.<br><br>Throwing together BS (as both town and scum--believe me, I BS as town a lot. Heck, I think I BS more in my cases as town than I do as scum) and passing it off as a case. It's a habit I want to break. I'm sick and tired of it being what people expect of me. I'm sick and tired of people thinking that me not doing it is indicative of anything.<br><br>No. I will not make a BS case. I will make a legitimate, well-structured, well-defined, good-based, solid actual legitimate case against Xisi. And if you seriously think that me wanting to correct a flaw in my fundamental personality, if you seriously think me recognizing a weakness in my play and trying my damnedest to correct said weakness is actually scum-motivated?<br><br>You're either an idiot or a scum.<br><br>So bluntly, to use language you'd understand...fuck off.<br><br>You're not going to goad me into posting a rough draft."}

Its getting him flak, and why wouldn't it?  Mastin isn't dumb, he knows that promising a case on Xisi over and over and not actually making it is going to, at the very least, draw attention to him.  I don't see how Mastin could be scum and intentionally doing that.  I'd buy that he is scum and is growing apathetic with the game and just keeps putting it off, but he could just as easily be apathetic town in that event.  I could see Mastin/Admiral for that quick vote there which seemed a little panicked for a spot on the wagon.  Or possibly Orcinus/Mastin.<br><br>Xisi feels like lurk/derp town to me.  He is taking an unpopular stance on the Rondar investigate.  His predecessor was super OMGUSy and emotional and unafraid to play aggressively.  And I doubt a mastin/Xisi team on top of that since Mastin was shoving that all Day yesterday.  He could be buying town points with a scum Xis flip, but he was realllly going all out for that in that event."}

It was known I wasn't around to defend myself. It was known that I had made solid points against ThAd. And yet they were almost all entirely ignored. The most well-reasoned vote here is fitz, who himself admitted he was voting with his top three scumreads, and came to this conclusion by arbitrarily looking at VCA and ignoring the context of said votecounts. (Mainly, that I was coerced into the Rondar lynch, and that my slot wasn't around for the Ztife lynch.) So screw claiming. This wagon is bad, and whoever are the two town players on it should feel bad. </div></blockquote> There is nothing arbitrary about my use of VCA, I do VCA\u2019s in all my games FYI. The fact ZONEFACE bailed on this game while he continued to post actively on the sight does not scream town towards his participation off the Ztife wagon. And I think your excuse that you were coerced into voting Rondar is a misrep of the situation. You clearly were starting to lay the seeds of suspicion towards Rondar about halfway through your D1 stint and when you voted him\u2026get this\u2026.he was away from the site and not given the chance to claim. Does that sound familiar to you? It should because that is what you are jumping up and down screaming about at the moment which I find supremely hypocritical.<br><br>Unless Orc or Xisi get a solid wagon on them I\u2019m good where I\u2019m at."}

I can't answer for Zone's reasons for being replaced in this game. I can't defend against that point; there IS no defense against it. The closest I can think of is that ZONEACE got prodded, missed the deadline, saw he was being replaced, and thought that was the final word; he's an older player where \"replacing *playername*\" meant *playername* couldn't come back into the game. Or it could be that ZONEACE simply didn't notice the game, got prodded, and felt apathetic enough to let the slot be replaced. But as you can tell, that's just speculation. Just as the case about Zone being replaced here while active elsewhere is speculative that it means Zone didn't want to play in this game because Zone is scum.<br><br>It's a two-way street. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\"><br><br>The important factor is that ZONEACE just. wasn't. in. this. game.

Show me where he said he wasn't going to be around, and then show me where anyone points out that he's not around.

You've admitted that the VCA doesn't take into account the context, because the context proves that it was null, not scum as you claim it to be. You're pushing a point which is speculation that I cannot defend against without myself speculating, because it relies on something which neither of us has any knowledge of.

So all my points still stand against him PLUS the added bonus that his predecessor flaked. And ZF remained very active elsewhere on the site. He didn't request replacement because his plate was too full (ie Bitmap) and he didn't just suck and replace out due to popular demand (ie absta).

And I know you have used the 95% assessment in games where you were scum. The example I have was in regards to there being a scum RB and not towards a specific person being scum, but it's still relevant IMO. And I'd love links to a few of your recent scum games if you don't mind...since you like meta. Who do you think is more likely to be scum....xisi or ThAd?<br><br>Also...I agree that at a minimum I am wrong about at least two of the players in the four I suspect (possibly more). But you are wrong in your estimation that I suspect all of them more than I do you. I could probably get on board a Xisi or Orc lynch as an alternative to yours...but as shown by our recent wagon stalemate...I apparently do not favor a ThAd wagon to yours. And as no one else is feeling the orc xisi wagons I have been pushing most of the game...your's is more than sufficient. i.e Not dismantled.<br><br>The fact you can not defend against ZONEFACE's replacement in this game has absolutely nothing to do with the fact he was replaced out of the game while continuing to post actively on the site. It's not reason enough to vote somebody IMO but it is certainly a contributing factor worth consideration. For the record...from the time ZF last posted in this game (Jan 5th) until the time the D1 lynch occurred (Jan 11th)...ZF made ~117 posts on the site. That to me is suspect.<br><br>And say you were coerced to vote Rondar all you want but IMO you were not coerced. I would consider coercion to be the case when you are 'made' to vote someone you didn't necessarily suspect. To avoid a no lynch perhaps. I would not consider it coercion when someone points out that your lone vote on a wagon is doing no good and you decide to hop on your 2nd suspect's wagon. In fact...4 posts after you vote Rondar all you say on the subject is that <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4671167#p4671167\">Rondar is not your preferred lynch but he's your second suspect...right behind Xisi.</a> That's not fcuking coercion FYI.

First and foremost, life. It leaves enough time for me to read up on my games and to post, but to devote serious time to making the case...not so much. <br><br>Second of all, timing. When night came around, I closed the tab for the Xisi case. I thought it was a done deal, that I would be dead come morning. I was <span style=\"font-style: italic\">convinced</span> of it. I was absolutely sure I was going to end up dead. (Granted, I have no proof of this, but I'm not lying. I was sure. Dead-certain sure. That I was not living to see day four. The closest I have to proof is that I opened up with nothing but a vote on Xisi. No reasons given, nothing. That's because I was silently weighing things in my mind. As to why I was still alive, and what it implied. But YES. I thought I was living dead during the night. Claim all you'd like that I 'knew' I was going to live, but I. legitimately. honestly. completely. and totally. thought. I. was. dead.)<br><br>Third of all, priorities. I've been here before. Been in games with a half-finished case. When I focused solely on the case, know what happened?<br><br>I got lynched for working solely on the case.<br><br>If people left me alone, the case would get done. But nope! I have to be suspect #1, suspect #2, suspect #3, and so on. People have to push me. And if I don't push back, I get lynched. Plain and simple. So what do I do? Of course I defend myself, so that I can potentially finish the Xisi case...BUT, I ALSO know that purely defending myself will just get me lynched just as totally ignoring everyone to work on the case will get me lynched.<br><br>So what have I been doing?<br><br>Raising valid point after valid point, which people brush off, focusing on hollow statements, statements I have offered logical counters to and been met with...<br>...Silence.<br><br>I'm a good 75% defense, and 24% short-term offense. The missing 1% is the long-term offense: the case.<br>Time management at its worst. I can't do all at the same time. I can't defend myself, while making good points, AND working on the case. It's the \"no more than two\" rule in full effect. You can have 2/3 just fine, but you're pretty much forbidden from having all three in something.<br><br>If people stopped attacking me for (put bluntly) retarded reasoning, then I could stop wasting that extra time on defense, and spend it on the case. If I only had to devote 1% of my time to defense, I could spend 25% of my time on short-term offense as I have been (seriously, read my iso--it already has PLENTY in it against Xisi and ThAd) and 74% of my time on the actual case.<br><br>But nope. I have to respond to bullshit like this. Which of course slows me down.<br><br>Time I spend working on responding here is time I am NOT spending working on the case. (\"So why not just work on the case?\" Weren't you listening? Because that'd get me lynched for ignoring the posts, as people think that I can't respond to the points because they're valid, because people think I am lurking, because people think that I'm stalling.<br>...Oh, like they're accusing me of doing right now for the case. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\"> It's lose-lose.

So go show me that. Quite frankly, I don't think you'll even try, because you'll quickly find it's either about equal or even the opposite of what you claim.<br><br>In newbies? Sure. Yeah. Replacing out yet remaining active means that you had a reason to replace out, and it is generally \"I panicked\".<br>But ZONEACE is no newbie. A veteran will NEVER replace out because they're in a bad situation. Not unless they want to catch flak for strategic replacement. Even so much as CONSIDERING it will get you a lot of bad attention. (See also, GvE, CvL.) So they never, EVER would do it as you are claiming Zone to have done.<br><br>And I'll repeat it as many times as necessary. It was not relevant to this game. It was null.

Decent chance hes maf, and if hes an SK then hes unlikely to get NK'd anytime soon anyways.<br><br>All THAT said, the VT claim is more reason I want to lynch Admiral today.  We likely have one more PR out there and I strongly believe there to be a doctor that I would rather not force to claim.  Im guessing Vifam is only alive because scum also fear a doctor role.

First he says that I'm scum for not voting thAd and trying to not piss of anybody, but that in itself is ridiculous since he's been sheeping people this entire game. Why is he flying under the radar so much? And then...he says he's not trying to piss me off after I OMGUS him. Why, why, why is this? If you found me scum, why aren't you voting me? Why am I SK and not mafia? Since when does RL conditions even remotely hint at your alliance?<br><br>I'm uncomfortable with Bacde. From my recollection, here's a summary of what he's been doing...actually I'll save that for next post. Fitz is still a better vote though. And fitz, I've said several times my points on why you are scum. Do you mind reading?<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=4739391#p4739391\" class=\"postlink\">post 1387</a>, AngryPidgeon wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=4738952#p4738952\" class=\"postlink\">post 1382</a>, havingfitz wrote:</cite>On an unrelated note (ie using sound logic)...I strongly suspect either mastin or ThAd are scum as if they were both town...scum could have easily achieved mislynch by now.  The question is...which one.  As I suspect mastin more than ThAd I'm sticking with the mastin wagon.  Between xisi and orc...orc is my preference.   So the only non-mastin wagon I will move to is orc.</div></blockquote><br>Can you explain this more?<br><br>So you are saying that if Mastin is scum, his buddy is voting with him and likewise for Admiral?  So mastin/{me/Bacde} or Admiral/{orcinus/xis}?  Which narrows your suspect pool down not at all.<br><br>I guess I see your logic, but I don't think its that black/white.  If they really are both town, its totally possible scum are afraid to cluster on the same ML wagon (possibly right next to each other?  if you think its Bacde/Mastin)  And really I dont see why scum would be rushing to ML necessarily as opposed to just, I dunno, dragging the day out and trying to not derp-hammer like that. &gt;.&gt;.<br><br>On a semi-related note.  Im starting to think Orcinus is a good vote.  I have pretty reasonable townreads on everyone that isn't Fitz/Orcinus/Admiral and Orcinus's recent shenanigans just seem off.  Bacde isn't getting lynched today.  Its like hes riding the \"Ya I might be the arsonist\" wave with the OMGUS.  Thats kind of a gut/paranoia fueled read, but eh.  I definitely don't have a townread on that slot.<br><br>That said, I strongly doubt Orcinus/Fitz are a team given the absurd walls that they had back and forth on D1.  Its possible one is SK and one is Maf. but I think I'd rather lynch ThAdmiral since there is almost no way Orc/Fitz are team.  I don't know Fitz to be one to bus so aggressively anyways.

I want to know what your opinions on some things in the game have been too--for instance, your logic in the end of day vote in narrowing down options, and how you think blindly sheeping is in any way pro-town.

Not once, but twice in that game, and it'd be THREE times this game.<br><br>That, alone, is incredibly strong, in addition to orcinus's other points."}

Abandon ship. So many of his friends had already met an untimely demise, and he wouldn't be next. He was surrounded by cold blooded killers and didn't trust anybody. Xisiqomelir quickly threw some essential supplies into a backpack and stole away into the dark of night.<br><br>As he passed by Vifam's house he saw two shadowy figures slip into the front door. Little Vifam was in trouble! Xisiqomelir couldn't just leave behind an innocent child. After gathering all of his courage, he pressed on towards the house. He could smell the scent of gasoline and knew he didn't have much time to act.<br><br>Xisiqomelir peeked inside a window and saw the back of a young boy tied to a chair, surrounded by sticks of dynamite. The shady figures were nowhere in sight. Perhaps they forgot their blowtorches? He still had time, what a stroke of luck! Xisiqomelir slipped inside the house and hurried to the side of Vifam. He started to untie the boy and patted his hair. \"Don't be scared, I'll get you out of here.\"<br><br>Then the mop fell off Vifam's head. It wasn't Vifam at all! The child was a fake. In the doll's hands was a note that read, \"We knew you'd run. You're no match for us!\"<br><br>As Xisiqomelir repeatedly hit his head against the wall after reading the terrible 'match' pun, he heard the lock to the door click shut. Moments later, a molotov cocktail sailed through the window.<br><br>The fire spread across the floor lined with gasoline, and quickly reached the pile of stacked dynamite.</span></span><br><br><iframe width=\"420\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/zsTRxXvQY0s\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe><br><br><span style=\"color: #0040BF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Xisiqomelir,</span></span> <span style=\"color: #008000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vanilla Townie</span></span></span><span style=\"color: #0040BF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">, ASPLODED Night 5</span></span><br><br><span style=\"color: #0040BF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Vifam,</span></span> <span style=\"color: #008000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Town Innocent Child</span></span></span><span style=\"color: #0040BF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">, ENDGAMED</span></span><br><span style=\"color: #0040BF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">orcinus_theoriginal,</span></span> <span style=\"color: #FF8000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Arsonist</span></span></span><span style=\"color: #0040BF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">, ENDGAMED</span></span><br><br><span style=\"color: #0040BF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">AngryPidgeon,</span></span> <span style=\"color: #FF0000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Mafia Roleblocker</span></span></span><span style=\"color: #0040BF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">, mastin2,</span></span> <span style=\"color: #FF0000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Mafia Goon</span></span></span><span style=\"color: #0040BF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">, and Ztife,</span></span> <span style=\"color: #FF0000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span class=\"noboldsig\">Mafia Goon</span></span></span><span style=\"color: #0040BF\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">, have won Mini 1408: Playing with Fire.</span></span>"}
