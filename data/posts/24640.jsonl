Hi! I'm the mod. How's it going?<br>\n2. Everything written by the me will be in <div style=\"display:inline;color:#0040BF\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">blue</div></div>. No other text in post messages should appear in blue. If you post anything in blue (other than your signature) it will be edited to a different color, and a player may be mod-killed if they are pretending I wrote it.<br>\n3. You may paraphrase communications you have with me. Directly quoting anything I wrote to you is prohibited, and a player may be mod-killed for doing it.<br>\n4. If you need to get my attention on a matter, you can post in the thread in <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">bold</div>, or send me a PM.<br>\n5. As the mod, I am always right and often accurate. If you see me mess up, please let me know.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Posting During Day, Night, and Twilight</div><br>\n6. During the day and twilight, surviving players may only discuss this game in this thread. All other communication with other players is prohibited.<br>\n7. No small, invisible, or encrypted text.<br>\n8. Once I lock the thread and declare night, you may communicate with other players only if your role PM explicitly says you may.<br>\n9. If you are killed or lynched, you may make one short \"bah!\" post.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Voting and Lynches</div><br>\n10. Only votes that are in bold and appear substantially in the format <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: That Guy</div> will be counted.<br>\n11. Unvotes are optional, but if you do it also must be bolded.<br>\n12. A lynch occurs when a player receives a majority of possible votes (half the number of the surviving players rounded down plus one). Once a player is lynched, the game enters twilight and no further votes or unvotes will be counted. Night occurs when I declare the lynch and lock the thread.<br>\n13. You may vote for no lynch. If a number of these votes make it impossible to secure a lynch by the above-stated majority, the day will end without a lynch. This is half the number of surviving players rounded up.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Deadlines</div><br>\n14. Days (including the first) will have default deadline of two weeks. A day deadline can be extended one week by player request.<br>\n15. Nights will have a default deadline of 48 hours, or 72 hours if any part of the night will occur over a weekend. A night deadline can be extended 24 hours by player request.<br>\n16. If a day deadline passes and no one has a majority of votes, the day ends with no lynch. If a night deadline passes and you have not made a night choice, you will take no night action that night.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Activity</div><br>\n17. If you will be V/LA for more than three days, please post in bold or send me a PM.<br>\n18. You are expected to post at least once every three days. If you do not, I will send you a prod, which you must respond to by posting in this thread within 48 hours. If you do not respond to a prod, or have to be prodded more than twice, you will probably be replaced.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Ok, Let's Get Started</div><br>\n19. In addition to these rules, all site-wide rules apply.<br>\n20. Very soon, if not already, you should have received a role PM. This game is SEMI-OPEN, which means I will reveal all of the roles that can possibly be in this game. This is NOT a promise regarding role distribution, for instance a role may be completely absent from the game or there may be copies of the same role. This IS a promise that any role not listed here will not be part of the game.<br>\n21. Please PM me to confirm (this may be the 3rd time you've read that).<br>\n22. Good luck, and have fun!", "time": "Thu Dec 27, 2012 12:28 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=24640&start=0", "forum": "53", "thread": "24640"}

There's no town-sided reason behind attempting to reduce the credibility of another player's posts, it only makes it easier for him to make me look like weak town in the mid and late game. If Zar was town, why wouldn't he simply paint me as town, rather than use the damning indictment of the label 'Village Idiot'.<br>\n<br>\nAlso, if I have a scum read, fuck yes I am going to vote them, regardless of whomever else is voting.<br>\n<br>\nEBWOP: Well at least you've responded to my question: You're belittling my future arguments by reducing any crediblity I'm garnering from my actions now. By doing so, you make me look weak as a player, and unable to contribute anything of worth, or any reads that are likely to be accurate. That is anti-town play. For what reason would a pro-town aligned player seek to label a player (regarded by several as being likely to be town) as a village idiot other than to weaken people's trust in that player's ability? The term itself shows that you think I'm town-aligned, yet you're showing contempt for my arguments, dismissing them as crap.

It's not a true scumhunting tactic, since some people will undoubtedly be unhappy with sharing their timezones and hours of activity, but the division of opinion on the intent behind this question got us out of RVS, which is only a good thing.<br>\n<br>\nAnd with memes, it's a game that's designed for enjoyment.

The fact that somebody is confirmed town doesn't mean that their cases or reads have to be accurate or that other players in the game may not question their reasoning.

I can think of an example:<br>\n<br>\nIn one game setup I was playing on Epicmafia, we were at 5-way lylo with 2 clears and 3 of us claiming townie (when there was confirmed only 1 townie left).  Needless to say, me and my mafia partner (who were both claiming townie) were both very nervous.  One of the clears asked us what our reads were before they were going to lynch between us, and my partner said \"Bacde is my townread\".  He said that his role-counterclaim was his townread.<br>\n<br>\nThis statement doesn't make any sense from a town mindset, and was obviously said because my partner was in a different mental headspace than a townsperson (my partner ended up getting lynched).  Likewise, scum will often make similar mistakes where it just seems like they aren't figuring things out how they should if they are town.<br>\n<br>\nRemember: Town are looking at everything trying to solve the mystery.  Scum aren't trying to solve a mystery, and are just looking at other posts to see if they can act as though they are scummy.  If it seems like someone is just trying to make other people look scummy without thinking things through, then they have a scum mindset, and are likely scum.", "time": "Thu Jan 03, 2013 7:05 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=24640&start=175", "forum": "53", "thread": "24640"}

He also thinks I wasn't annoyed by absta's questions. I was, but even if I wasn't - this is a scumtell?<br>\nFurthermore I find it odd that he seems to not think I'm 100% scummy with some of his comments - for example he believes I made a genuine mistake at the start of the game in regards to absta and not reading that mod-post that he was conf-town (which, it must be repeated, is a null tell), and also said that he sort of agreed with my 99 (check out ap's 324) - but despite this he is still is acting as if I'm conf-scum or something.

Most of his suspicions come from stuff that happened within the first few pages (i.e. delta's timezone question, my mocking of absta's questions to delta). He also doesn't explain why he thinks zar is scummy based off his read to page 5. He also doesn't explain why he thinks orc is scummier than rev due to their exchange, or why I'm scummier than zar. He also doesn't like it when people use town or scum motivations as tells (what? that's like the best way to catch scum?!). He also doesn't explain why delta is town...<br>\nActually his catchup post is all around terrible.<br>\nscum<br>\n<br>\ndelta - would have said he was town earlier in the game but his jump on me looks like shameless bandwagoning.

This despite the limited amount of comment orcinus provides when he voted Sibelius earlier seems based on the same reasoning as Revenus provides.

In defense of absta's point, when he started debating the matter with you no one else had made an RVS vote without any reason. And you are coming off defensive IMO towards our only confirmed town for what IMO was simply an RVS vote with a reason (i.e. abta's on you). <div style=\"display:inline;color:#800000\">No clue what this says. I don't see why you're bringing up RVS in a scum-argument like 15 pages into day 1, and Om later on said that it was my lack of reason and talk with absta that got us out of RVS. I don't see why you felt it necessary to say that I am coming off as defensive. Absta took words out of my mouth and misrepresented me and that is why I responded in the way I did. Is there something wrong?</div> <div style=\"display:inline;color:green\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">What I&#8217;m saying is is that you were getting unnecessarily defensive off a RV. That&#8217;s my opinion. Is that a misrep too? Absta made a reasonable assumption which at least got you talking. I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s a &#8220;misrep&#8221; given your page one posting.</div></div><div style=\"display:inline;color:#800000\"> Yeah no. Absta asked me a question. I answered it.

I disagree with this assessment. All my predecessor did was call it fishy. Then in a completely seperate line he said other than that (other than his observation towards Bacde) he had no definitive reads. Is \"definitively fishy\" a tell? And at the bottom of page 2 I see nothing wrong with thinking someone's actions towards our lone confirmed townie could be construed as suspect. When I first read Bacde's post 36 I took it as joking but if others didn't....so what. You look to be pushing a case that has no meat. (Not OK) <div style=\"display:inline;color:#800000\">Uh. No. Do you understand what the word <div style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">otherwise</div> means? \"No definitive reads <div style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">otherwise</div>\"?</div> <div style=\"display:inline;color:green\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">You&#8217;ve ignored my comment above and focused on semantics.

OK&#8230;.so what is your case on Sibelius (/Bitmap/me) then and now? Saying someone looked fishy halfway through page 2? How definitive a read should someone have halfway through page 2? And how many definitive reads should someone have halfway through page 2? That&#8217;s the best you&#8217;ve got?</div></div> <div style=\"display:inline;color:#800000\">Lol. Your \"view\" of what Sibelius said. I'm not saying anything that Sibelius didn't say himself. You seem to lack the grasp on the basic function of the word \"otherwise\" in his post, which implies that he did have a definitive read. This is not up for question. Nobody should have any definitive reads halfway through page 2, which is why it's incredibly suspect that he gave one.</div><br>\n<br>\nThen you go on to say to Rondar that you only pay attention in RVS to the reasoning of the votes...despite the fact you gave none yourself. <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":?\" title=\"Confused\"> (contradictory...i.e. suspect)<div style=\"display:inline;color:#800000\">How is that contradictory in any way whatsoever?

Why did you like Orcinus's Admiral case but not mine?<br>\n<br>\nYou called Ztife town.  Defending or whatever.<br>\n<br>\n@Fitz: You never said anything about or to Mastin but you suddenly say that his read on you/orcinus sucks, and that he was doing so well.  So why is mastin such a strong townread for you even though you are avoiding saying it?<br>\n<br>\nAlso, read on Admiral?  You said you agreed with most of mastin's reads barring you/orc, but you evidently also disagree on qwints.<br>\n<br>\n@Bacde/absta (I forget who was saying it): You think Admiral can't be scum with Ztife because of the weird bus that entails on Ztife's end?  But you think qwints/Ztife makes sense?  So it makes sense in your mind(s?) that Ztife wouldn't vote Admiral when he did as buddies, but it DOES make sense for him to vote park his buddy, forget (apparently) that his vote is there, and then defend his buddy with it still there?  Unless Ztife is a complete moron, there is absolutely no way qwints is his buddy.  I might hear arguments for qwints being 3rd party, but there is no way scum-Ztife forgets he is voting his buddy and then defends his buddy without checking where his vote is.  Inb4 WIFOM.

Why does scum defend anyone??  Ironically, I think YOU are reading too much into this.  Ztife fucked up and forgot what his reads were.  Scum are MORE careful around their buddies.

I've already explained this earlier...there is no \"suddenly\" wrt to my actions towards mastin. When he was ZONEFACE he was a non entity (ie no read). I also have had suspicions towards others so he has not been a suspect to me (as ZF or mastin) for that reason as well (i.e. POE). I have thought he has made some good posts but I do disagree with any suspicions he has towards me or town sentiment he might have towards orcinus. I don't get why you are trying to create a scenario that doesn't exist. In summary...I think mastin is making a solid effort at finding scum and for the most part I think he is making sense. But of course that doesn't mean I am going to mindlessly sheep him and I will disagree with anyone who has any suspicions towards me or town feelings towards those I do suspect. <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_idea.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":idea:\" title=\"Idea\"><br>\n<br>\nMy read on ThaD; he was probably my next main suspect D1 after orcinus but his posting has gotten better IMO and along his Ztife interactions towards the end of D1, he has dropped a bit. Null leaning scum. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Also, I never said I agreed with most of mastin's reads; and who are you to decide that I think mastin is a strong townread?</div> I do have a townread on mastin but nowhere do I state that and I typically would not state that unless the situation warranted it (ex. a wagon building up on a \"strong townread\"). If mastin thinks qwints is town...then yes...at the moment I would disagree with that (for reasons provided <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4643726#p4643726\">here</a>).

I said he was doing well and for the most part that I have found his content reasonable. Even thinking someone is being reasonable does not indicate agreement. Someone can make a reasonable argument that someone else is suspicious or townish but just because I think they are being \"reasonable\" doesn't mean I agree with them. And compared to ZF, mastin is doing well.<br>\n<br>\n@qwints...you never really answered/addressed my questions of how I had gone to your scummiest player in such a short period of time. Why? And is your <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4644239#p4644239\">case on me</a> really just the lack of intereaction between Ztife and I? If not...please explain. I also like how in your spoiler on Ztife's activities that he <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">attacks qwints (171/221)</div>, <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">calls orc + qwints scummy (221)</div> and then 4 pages later <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">defends qwints from a vote by Rev (322)</div>.

ZONEFACE was a complete non-entity at that time (and most of D1 I might add) and orcinus is trying to get people off of Ztife (one of his top 2 scum reads) and on to ZONEFACE. He's not even trying to get people on to me. And that is it for orcinus's contribution wrt Ztife on D1.

For the majority of people...especially those who like believe in VCAs...being on a mislynch is baaaad.

Consider how fast the Ztife wagon flew.  Absta101 voted it followed immediately by me and then Bacde.  Rondar comes in and makes a prod-dodgy post, then catches up and we get this (and he votes Fitzy):<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4623339#p4623339\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4623339#p4623339\" data-post-id=\"4623339\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 357</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=20365\">Rondar</a> wrote:</cite>@Ztife Well... why don't you propose we do something instead?

His vote is justified with \"oops, my Fitz vote is bad, ya OBVIOUSLY ztife is the right lynch\"...really?<br>\n<br>\nWhy was Ztife so obviously the right lynch to Rondar who was ignoring him like a boss before that? (Don't over think this one)<br>\n<br>\n2. Admiral connections.  Admiral defends him by attacking Zar.  Admiral now votes Rondar despite Fitz being the larger wagon and is other scumread (like fitz said, why would admiral avoid a larger wagon on a scumread?)  I guess thats a more compelling reason to vote Admiral really, but eh.  Oh, and they both suspected Fitz at the same time.  Plus Rondar had a brief flit with voting Admiral but then left it for Fitz immediately.  Feels like distancing whilst trying to steer wagons to Fitz.<br>\n<br>\n3. He did it.  He killed the people.<br>\n<br>\nP-edit: I'd be prettttty shocked if there were no SK in the game.  Given that the setup is semi-open (not usually or ever really done in mini normals) there must be SOME reason for it.  The SK role is pretty non-normal and I think people would start rioting if on like N4 suddenly a bunch of people died and the town lost.  So the only way to but that role in the game is to make it semi-open so people can anticipate it I guess.  So I think the setup is open because KJ wanted to make an intersting SK variation but fully closed would rustle to many feathers.  THAT being said, I also bet there is a cop in the game because the SK can choose investigation immunity.  Why have that be a choice otherwise?  /wifom /setupspec /scumpost.", "time": "Thu Jan 17, 2013 8:29 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=24640&start=825", "forum": "53", "thread": "24640"}

It's distancing without actually placing pressure.<br>\n<br>\nUnlike Zar, I liked Rondar's first <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4600366#p4600366\" class=\"postlink\">substantive post</a>. While his posting has been sporadic, I feel like his reads make sense. He's also consistently had more town reads than scum reads, and hasn't been afraid to go against the grain or be the first on a read. Looking at <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4623339#p4623339\" class=\"postlink\">357</a> followed by <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4625014#p4625014\" class=\"postlink\">367</a>, it's hard to see a reason for the sudden hop onto the ztife bus.<br>\n<br>\nAt 357, ztife is the leading wagon with 3 votes while 3 players (ThAdmiral, me, HF) have 2 votes. HF was also briefly voted by Revenus. So I can buy the HF vote in 357 as an attempt to create a leading counterwagon given that there's hope that Revenus comes along. On the other hand, he moves me from scummy to null and doesn't mention ThAdmiral which seems to limit his options.<br>\n<br>\nThe following posts are quite critical of Rondar's 357 - with HF, absta and revenus chastising him for not reading adequately. Absta doesn't buy the HF case and ThAdmiral leaves the HF wagon for a lone delta vote. <br>\n<br>\nWhat I would expect scum-Rondar to do in 367 is test another counter-wagon to ztife - either ThAdmiral or me. Instead, he declares ztife the lynch without providing himself any outs (unless questioning ThAdmiral on his criticism of absta counts.) Then in 369, conf-town absta get off the Ztife wagon, although he lists the lynch as ztife or HF in his next post.<br>\n<br>\nToday, he's pushed for both HF and ThAdmiral lynches, but got off both. If ThAdmiral's scum, Rondar's quick jump to the HF wagon I started looks bad but otherwise, it looks quite town to me. <br>\n<br>\nThe biggest thing I don't buy about ThAdmiral's case is attacking Rondar for slowly building to the attack on him. All of those posts except 1 took place after the Ztife hammer and the 1 wasn't very much of an attack. There were lots of other names being floated for the day 1 lynch besides Ztife and rondar never bit. <br>\n<br>\ntl;dr - there's a few things that could support rondar being scum, but overall I just don't see it. I think Rondar's much more likely to be town than mafia.", "time": "Fri Jan 18, 2013 11:07 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=24640&start=850", "forum": "53", "thread": "24640"}

I had a tiny gut scumread on him at that point so I just flinged the vote on him. His reply nullified the only real reason I had for voting him, so I unvoted, feeling rather stupid (to reply to anyone who'll say 'why do you need a reason?', I say: 'The tiny gut scumread wasn't enough to vote him, especially after feeling it had gone down the drain').<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">THEN</div> I voted Ztife who had been my other soft scumread. I literally had no one else that I suspected and thought I'd vote him for pressure, since Zar said I should try pressuring more (well, he said it while aggressively scumreading me, but that's what I got of it). Now <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">that</div> is why I said 'easily'. And in response, and I absolutely hate how everyone is ignoring this, Ztife makes <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4630594#p4630594\" class=\"postlink\">Post 428</a>. Now, read that post again and tell me how, in a world where I have no other real scumreads, that isn't supposed to scream 'I'M SCUM, LYNCH ME!!!'? First of all, he team-scumreads me, Revenus and ThAd which is just bad. Really bad. His later comment about last scum being in the lurkers (<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">@ThAd</div>, this is for you too), seemed like<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">A)</div> he was absolutely positive who scum was  after a mere 200 game-posts and <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">B)</div> he was making an empty excuse just to round up his reads, <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">C</div> kind of contradicted what he said in 428 (although I just noticed that now), and <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">D)</div> he was ignoring the fact he himself, was a lurker, which just seemed like yet another 'lollynchme', for me.

I meant that the ability to kill 3-4 people on one night is atypical for a SK, ESPECIALLY in a normal game.  I dont know if its actually non-normal, but its certainly weird enough that it could blindside people quite heavily and I think the setup is open for that reason.  Which is why I strongly believe there is an Arsonist because I just can't see otherwise given the openness of the game and the relevant flavor.  (Ya, I just used flavor to justify my setup spec. Kill me.)<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Kill spec</div>: Ok, so I just finished a scum game in Theme Park and my team and I focused on NKing strong leaders regardless of their reads or how lynchable they were.  Revenus WAS a strong leader and could have been killed for being unpredictable and being able to swing wagons.  And really no one had a scum read on that slot.  He was obvtown and possibly a PR and was definitely a wildcard.  He makes perfect sense as an NK.<br>\n<br>\nTHAT said, I could see Fitz killing him more than anyone else, but I'm not comfortable with that.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Xisi</div>: I agree with Bacde here pretty much.

I feel like Vifam is voting ORcinus for lack of a better wagon (correct me if Im wrong).  Bacde, who would your dream lynch(es) be at the moment?  Rondar's Ztife vote is really bad as Admiral pointed out.  He admits to Ztife being a weak read at the time but that doesnt match what happened.  He ignroes Ztife (calls him odd I guess), votes Fitz, and shortly after calls Ztife the obvious lynch after Fitz responds.  I think the speed of the Ztife wagon hit him and he realized that Ztife was going to go down and no one was really a good CW seeing that the Ztife wagon had some strong vocal supporters on it (me/Bacde).  Seriously, you don't try and go against the flow when that happens.  Side note: Bacde, what was your Fitz read at that time?  I could go look, but.<br>\n<br>\nNot feeling Admiral right now.

Revenus has already suggested in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4622362#p4622362\" class=\"postlink\">352</a> a willingness to lynch ztife and jumps to the ztife wagon shortly after it becomes the leading one. The game continues without another wagon even really attracting attention - discussion instead being dominated by the Orc-HF feud. Several players listing Ztife as a possible target. Rondar's scummiest post in this sequence is when he asks AP about Zoneace in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4628613#p4628613\" class=\"postlink\">407</a>, but he doesn't follow up on it before Ztife basically outs himself in 428. ThAd, myself and Zar then finish the lynch of the obvious scum. <br>\n<br>\nWhy wouldn't scum-Rondar have at least raised the possibility of a ThAd or qwints lynch? That's why I don't see him as scum. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\nWhile reviewing, I also found this gem: <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4628277#p4628277\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4628277#p4628277\" data-post-id=\"4628277\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 404</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=11821\">havingfitz</a> wrote:</cite>As for voting out ZONEACE or Zifte&#8230;is it entirely for basically being worthless in this game?

In post 357 he said of qwints: \"To those asking why I never voted qwints (Zar and orc, among others): I really didn't find his one scummy-ish post to be convincing enough for a vote\". If he had flipped on this stance he would have been called on it for contradicting himself and would likely have eaten rope for such a clear example of it. He had hardly mentioned me at all, so once again a move to my wagon would have been awkward. He probably could have gotten away with it but, like I said, he could have feared being called on it. I also think you underestimate how much traction that wagon was building up. It was fast and it was being pushed by the \"leaders\" of the game.<br>\nOther than that sometimes you just do stuff that people don't expect you to do as scum. I remember once in a really small game (like 7 people game) I played a few years ago, where I only had one scum partner, I tunnelled the shit out of my partner day one until he was lynched and then rode the wave of near-confirmed status to win the game (it was more complicated than that, but that's the gist).", "time": "Tue Jan 22, 2013 2:15 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=24640&start=950", "forum": "53", "thread": "24640"}

A single game which happened to be one of my top 5 worst games of all time, along-side Tricycle Mafia almost making me retire. Completely ignores almost all my other games, including the ones which helped convince me not to retire, such as the similar Underground Mafia where I nailed the entire scumteam in my opening post and continued to hammer it in, even developing a gamebreaking strategy which if the town had followed would have resulted in our win, rather than eventual 3p lylo loss. Or even Ald's open Fire and Ice mafia, where I correctly identified 3/4 of the scum, and consistently pushed for their lynches. Or half a dozen other games.<br>\n<br>\nThis is EXACTLY the kind of meta which I call being bullshit, since it is exactly that. A single game from over a year ago ignoring all my other games at that same time period does not a good case make.<br>\n<br>\nNotice the fence-sitting with regards to qwints, pushing for a potential qwints lynch. Also note the subtle shot at Bacde, applying pressure there. And as a further case against him, he says that Zar deserves attention, when the entire rest of the town had Zar as a townread--this serves to create (just before night) a critical level of doubt, as any protective PR will have seen Xisi's post, thought that maybe he actually had something important, and protected someone not-Zar.<br>\n<br>\nYet critically, he does not actually give the Zar case. He doesn't even give a summary. He doesn't explain his suspicion, only saying he will if there's no lock.

It's incredibly easy to convince the doctor <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">not</div> to protect a specific player.<br>\n<br>\nBasically, to ensure the nightkill goes through, they need to make sure that the doctor is not on their target. Technically, the doctor should be on the innocent child, but any efforts to ensure that the doctor actually IS will backfire and make it so that they aren't.

You don't know Rondar is a cop.<br>\nYou see a divided town. Now think that through. Which is more beneficial?<br>\n-Get a lynch. Town gets information. That information helps them better locate scum.<br>\n-Don't get a lynch. Town gets no information. The next day, the division from the previous day phase continues, only a whole lot worse.<br>\n<br>\nTo see this in full effect, you need not look further than Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Legacy. Town divided over a zabriel lynch. Did scum push that mislynch through? No, they did not. They let it fail, so that in the next day phase, the division would continue.<br>\n<br>\nBest yet, because you avoided hopping onto the mislynch, you don't get suspicion from it!<br>\n<br>\nPlus, as a final bonus, a no-lynch throws the town onto evens. The town must therefore no-lynch to off-balance that somewhere down the line, which gives the scum one extra nightkill. If the town refuses to no-lynch, then that gives one extra body to be mislynched.<br>\n<br>\nSo tell me again, what's the town motive in not taking a stance?<br>\n'Cause I just showed you rather clearly the scum motive in his actions.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nAs for my change in Rondar read, I don't really remember what sparked the change. I think it was that his posting got weaker, his stances seemed scummier, I did some review, and found him less towny than I initially declared. But I dunno, he really wasn't that large of a suspect.

(Maybe earlier, but that's when I know the idea was in my mind for sure. <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\">) And this morning, I got inspired, with some ideas on how to format it. Typically, I tend to avoid cases longer than a paragraph, but my HOPE is that the case I'm beginning work on now will be structured in such a way that people don't really care that it's longer. With luck, it'll still be concise and clear enough that I don't even need spoiler tags. <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\"><br>\n'Course, I'll provide a summary all the same, for those too lazy to look it over.<br>\n<br>\nThis case will likely eat up enough time that I might not finish it today. Need to do the research, organize my stuff, address people in terms they understand, tweak and edit the message, revise it, proofread it, evaluate it and eliminate from it anything I don't actually believe (that's a biggie <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\">), limit redundancy (except when used for emphasis), highlight the important stuff, make sure it's readable, acknowledge the opposition I'll receive, and such.<br>\n<br>\n(Note--the case will be just on Xisi's slot, so \"Why is this bad for Xisi, but not for X?\" will not be included in the case. If the case itself is not persuasive enough, then I'll do a followthrough and explain my stances on the other players and why Xisi is the optimal lynch in comparison.)<br>\n<br>\nAnd if at all possible, make it fun to read. <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\"><br>\n<br>\n(Am I biting off more than I can chew, it's possible, but I really don't think that I am.

As long as the player chooses decent targets they will probably win night 4.<br>\nYes, that means they have to live until night 4 without killing anyone or dying.

Since you're not seeing my offense, what exactly am I supposed to do? Chime in every three days, say \"still working on my Xisi case\", and let the suspicion on me mount?<br>\n<br>\nScrew that.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nThere is no scum motive in stalling, because it's counterproductive. Pretty much every. single. damn. time. I've been lynched as scum, it's been at least partially for this view of me stalling. No, seriously. Outside of a hydra, that's the NUMBER ONE THING which has caused my lynch when I'm scum. It happened in GvE, CvL. It happened in Mafia on Werewolf Island. It happened in <div style=\"display:inline-flex;text-decoration:line-through\">Batman and Friends</div> DCU Mafia. It happened in Flash Mafia 3. (In fact, that was the reason I got hammered!) It happened in every single scum game I had on Mastin, from Boost Mafia 2 to Emerald City to OhGodMyHamlet. (Or was it OhGodMyVillage? Whichever of the two I was scum in. <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\">) It has been the primary cause of not just most of my scum lynches, but a huge number of my town lynches as well, this bullshit about scum stalling.<br>\n<br>\nSo as you can imagine, I know not to do it. I'm sick. and tired. of hearing people accuse me of it. Never. not once. Have I done so for strategic value. It has never been planned. Not as scum, and certainly not as town. Always. So don't give me that crap about there being scum motive in my having stalled. There isn't any. What there IS plenty of, is me biting off more than I can chew, and catching flak for it. So if you think my ambition makes me scummy, go press that. Go press that I'm lazy. I just got lynched for it (AP can verify), so surely it wouldn't be that hard to use it as an excuse to justify a wagon on me.<br>\n<br>\nBut drop that stalling BS now.<br>\n<br>\nIn theory, it could have scum motive, in that it could make it so that people drop you off of their radar while they wait.<br>\nIn practice, they never, EVER do. If anything, every day of \"stalling\" is another day their suspicion GROWS, rather than shrinks. It doesn't work as a scum tactic at all.<br>\nIn theory, it could have a scum motive, in that you push the case right next to deadline, not giving people enough time to process it. It makes it so that the lynch either fails (so you can save it for tomorrow) or is rushed (as people don't have the time to pick it apart).<br>\nIn practice, this only makes it look bad. (See also: what Xisi did just before night, shining suspicion onto Zar.) The player catches flak for the late case, and it's dissected overnight. All of the flaws present in the case are exposed, and the person making the case is either ignored or lynched.

Two are completely different things. You can be pushing a lynch yet \"stalling\" a case, you can be chugging out case after case yet still not be pushing a lynch, you can be stalling AND not pushing a lynch, and you can be not-stalling while also pushing a lynch.<br>\n<br>\nThe two may have some overlap, but they're not even close to the same concept. You can push a lynch without a case. You can create a case without pushing a lynch. Ideally, you want to push a lynch with a case, and it is, in fact, scummy to neither push a case nor push a lynch--but it's MUCH more for the latter than the former.<br>\n<br>\nI'm pushing a Xisi case.

Been there, done that, stop saying it in your ignorance. I have reasons for switching unrelated to mafia. mastin2 was the original version of my username on the forum it originated from. I called myself Mastin, of course, so when I went to another random forum I was linked to, to practice my mafia skills on, that's the name I signed up as.<br>\n<br>\n...A 'random forum', which just so happened to be mafiascum.net. <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\"> (As much of a home as MS.net has been to me...you have to realize that MS.net has never, and will never be, the forum I am most attached to. At the time I signed up as Mastin, it was just another random forum which I thought would be good practice for the mafia games we were running on the site where I'm mastin2. Yes, it's a lot more than that to me now. Just because I'm more attached elsewhere doesn't mean I'm not attached; I can't leave this site even if I wanted to, as mafia has become part of my soul. But to really know me, you have to understand that aspect of me, that mafia--while influencing my life severely--has not dominated it. This is emphasized much better in mastin2 than it was in Mastin.)<br>\n<br>\nI'm much more comfortable as mastin2. It's the name I originally had, and it fits me better. Plus, it's got a lot of symbolism. The fact that mastin2 was created on my one-year scumday has--and always will be--proof that this story isn't made up; the switch was always planned. It's like Demon Hybrid into Matias. Same scummer, different username.

It's something which can be expected of nervous scum when they don't have the confidence to construct a false relationship with their scumbuddies.<br>\n<br>\nFrom the havingfitz side, there's the non-hammer, in lieu of pushing orcinus some more when ztife was at L-1.

You know me well enough to know I get distracted, that I slack off, that I am busy with life, that I lose motivation for playing sometimes, and it shouldn't take a genius to figure out that combining all of these factors combined don't make for a good case-building environment.

I see the logic, but I'm pretty sure Rev was killed for being a universal townread and being a big townleader.  And Rev suspected a bunch of people.  Part of why I don't like Admiral was his immediate hop on the Fitz Wagon after the Revenus flip for much the same reason.<br>\n<br>\nWe should be lynching Admiral.  His Ztife vote was incredibly awkward and reeks of a last effort ditch for towncred.  His Fitz case on D2 based on Revenus dying was really sketchy.  He is preemptively giving up instead of trying to make a good case on his way out.  I don't like his PoE suspect pool of Mastin/Xis today despite Fitz being his main suspect.<br>\n<br>\nIm really torn on Mastin after his last post.  I've never known Mastin to lurk ever, but his bacde OMGUS looked really genuine.<br>\n<br>\nXis is a bad lynch imo.  Delta was really carefree town and Xis is taking an upopular stance wrt Rondar's investigate which is a good way to get singled out as scum.

Lately it seems you get nowhere without bashing people's heads in.<br>\n<br>\ntl;dr, threatening and forcing is the way to go nowadays. <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\"></div></blockquote> Short-term, yes. Strongarming your way through a lynch by threatening people and forcing yourself onto them aggressively and arrogantly will get you listened to, for a phase or two. The earlier in the game, the better. People think you're good, so they follow you.<br>\n<br>\nLong-term, though...if you don't have the results to back it up, they'll turn on you. They'll either ignore you even if you're right (reverse-7-for-7; you were wrong before, so you're wrong now), or call you scummy for pushing mislynch after mislynch--justifiably so, as looking at an overall picture and seeing a player consistently push mislynches is a decently-strong way to find scum more often than not. They'll realize that you never really had any solid reasoning to push said mislynches, either. You just forced them through with your attitude alone.<br>\n<br>\nAnd any hope you have of being listened to is lost.<br>\n<br>\nThat's why in the long-term, you can't afford to strongarm. People need to see you came from a good spot for why you pushed that mislynch. They need to see that you had good reasons, reasons which could have been right but were proven wrong. They need to see you addressing how you were wrong, and why THIS time you're right. You need to have that persuasiveness. Though it's not impossible to strongarm your way through, it's incredibly difficult. Even if you suddenly switch tactics from arrogant strongaming to reasonable negotiation, your previous strongarm tactics are going to make you look suspect, and furthermore, you'll catch attention for the sudden switch in tactics.<br>\n<br>\nHence, why it works really well short-term, but in the long-term is incredibly self-destructive. I've been in enough games to know that most town players don't really think that far ahead. The arrogant and abrasive players expect to be dead within a few night-phases, so they don't really anticipate living long enough for their tactics to be a problem.<br>\n<br>\nHowever, far too often, they DO live long enough for the town's paranoia to kick in, at which time, they've lost all semblance of credibility and will no longer hold as much influence over the game. Their short-term thinking means they didn't anticipate this hurdle, and now they have an uphill battle for the rest of the game to convince people they're still town (as they were originally seen as blindly), and convince people they're right (as they were originally seen as blindly).<br>\n<br>\nHence, why some long-term thinking is a necessity. If you start persuading (not forcing! not shoving your read down their throats! Legitimately persuading!<sup>^1</sup>) them from the beginning, you only get stronger as the game goes along. You'll start out weaker than those who strongarm through lynches, but over time, you'll just get better and better. People will see you've been trying to reason since the beginning, and the scum will take notice. Even if you're completely off your base, you're a threat, because you're showing solid logic and the ability to successfully negotiate, whereas a strongarm player shows very little ability to change.<br>\n<br>\nIn today's meta, scum can just bluntly target whoever they please, and get at least some following if they strongarm their way through. So what can a town player do to distinguish their strongarming from scum strongarming? It's not impossible, but it's incredibly difficult, as you're fighting against the very nature of human psychology.<br>\n<br>\nSo, the best strategy is to adapt a new approach. My suggested approach, of persuasion, of negotiating and convincing them with solid reasoning rather than throwaway pieces scattered across the game and bluntly threatening people, is the best way I can think of. It's not impossible for scum to do, but it's much harder for scum to do. <br>\n<br>\nBasically--strongarming is easy for scum to continue for the whole game, but gets much harder for town.<br>\nNegotiating is hard for scum to continue for the whole game, but gets much easier for town.<br>\n<br>\nFive years ago, it was of course vice-versa, with strongarming being town and negotiating being scum. But the site meta's shifted so drastically to be the opposite of that, into what I described above.<br>\n<br>\nAnd quite frankly, I think the site would be better-off returning at least partially to the good ol' ways. <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\"><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"font-size: 75%; line-height: normal; display: inline\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">1</div>:</div> Essentially, look at the difference.

All the while, they'd have gotten rid of the primary advocate for his lynch, and with the driving force behind it dead, and with the WIFOM they'd be able to invoke, chances would have been quite high Xisi would live for a minimum of just today.<br>\n<br>\nHence, why I didn't so much as bother to touch the Xisi case overnight. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\nMy lack of death, however, only reinforces my conviction. It's no secret that I doubt myself as town.<br>\nA lot.<br>\n<br>\nLike, seriously, a lot. <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\"><br>\n<br>\nThey could expect me to think that my lack of death means that I'm wrong about Xisi. I've done that MANY times before. (Sometimes erroneously, sometimes justifiably.) Furthermore, they can expect my death to incriminate Xisi, and if the town doesn't buy their wifom, Xisi would end up dead. As an added bonus...there's always the chance that Xisi wins the 1V1. I'm a charismatic player when I want to be, but generally, my charisma relies on me being a strong-arm arrogant player forcing my reads down your throats.<br>\n<br>\nThat's worked decently in the past, sure, yeah. And if you continue to press this bullshit that I have no case, I will. But it's a bad habit (like walls were a bad habit), one I am trying  to break. So don't push me, ThAd. You've seen me as scum; you KNOW that even as scum, I can (and do) make cases on any player regardless of how valid they look to you, because you KNOW that as scum, I never press something I don't believe in. Which means you KNOW that as scum, I can (and do!) put together a case when people accuse me of having none.<br>\n<br>\nLike, seriously. I did it in Mafia on Werewolf Island. I did it in <div style=\"display:inline-flex;text-decoration:line-through\">Batman and Friends</div> DCU Mafia. I did it in GvE, CvL. I can't really think of a scum game where I <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">haven't</div> done it, to be honest. I don't remember which of those you were in, but I'm pretty sure you were in at least one or two of 'em, so you'd see and KNOW this. It goes deeper than meta. It's been a fundamental part of my personality, since Mastin, which has carried over into all my games as mastin2.<br>\n<br>\nThrowing together BS (as both town and scum--believe me, I BS as town a lot. Heck, I think I BS more in my cases as town than I do as scum) and passing it off as a case. It's a habit I want to break. I'm sick and tired of it being what people expect of me. I'm sick and tired of people thinking that me not doing it is indicative of anything.<br>\n<br>\nNo. I will not make a BS case. I will make a legitimate, well-structured, well-defined, good-based, solid actual legitimate case against Xisi. And if you seriously think that me wanting to correct a flaw in my fundamental personality, if you seriously think me recognizing a weakness in my play and trying my damnedest to correct said weakness is actually scum-motivated?<br>\n<br>\nYou're either an idiot or a scum.<br>\n<br>\nSo bluntly, to use language you'd understand...fuck off.<br>\n<br>\nYou're not going to goad me into posting a rough draft.", "time": "Thu Feb 14, 2013 5:28 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=24640&start=1275", "forum": "53", "thread": "24640"}

And this game sucks.<br>\n<br>\nOK...so there are too many people still alive in this game that I would be cool seeing lynched.  Orcinus is #1.  Xisi is probably #2 (just like his case on me) and ThAd for his complete lack of contribution and mastin for his continued promise of a case on Xisi that was swapped for a vote on ThAd.

Trouble is...I also think there is a good chance AT LEAST one of his partners probably DID bus him and there are three in that group as well (AP, Bacde and ThAd).  So either way I have a 33% chance of hitting scum (assuming one on and one off the Ztife wagon).

The five still alive off that wagon are:<br>\n<br>\nVifam, AP, mastin, Bacde, ThAd.  Vifam was the hammer and believe it or not, is town.

It was known I wasn't around to defend myself. It was known that I had made solid points against ThAd. And yet they were almost all entirely ignored. The most well-reasoned vote here is fitz, who himself admitted he was voting with his top three scumreads, and came to this conclusion by arbitrarily looking at VCA and ignoring the context of said votecounts. (Mainly, that I was coerced into the Rondar lynch, and that my slot wasn't around for the Ztife lynch.) So screw claiming. This wagon is bad, and whoever are the two town players on it should feel bad. </div></blockquote> There is nothing arbitrary about my use of VCA, I do VCA&#8217;s in all my games FYI. The fact ZONEFACE bailed on this game while he continued to post actively on the sight does not scream town towards his participation off the Ztife wagon. And I think your excuse that you were coerced into voting Rondar is a misrep of the situation. You clearly were starting to lay the seeds of suspicion towards Rondar about halfway through your D1 stint and when you voted him&#8230;get this&#8230;.he was away from the site and not given the chance to claim. Does that sound familiar to you?

I can't answer for Zone's reasons for being replaced in this game. I can't defend against that point; there IS no defense against it. The closest I can think of is that ZONEACE got prodded, missed the deadline, saw he was being replaced, and thought that was the final word; he's an older player where \"replacing *playername*\" meant *playername* couldn't come back into the game. Or it could be that ZONEACE simply didn't notice the game, got prodded, and felt apathetic enough to let the slot be replaced. But as you can tell, that's just speculation. Just as the case about Zone being replaced here while active elsewhere is speculative that it means Zone didn't want to play in this game because Zone is scum.<br>\n<br>\nIt's a two-way street. <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\"><br>\n<br>\nThe important factor is that ZONEACE just. wasn't. in. this. game. The slot was dead. It was going to be replaced. You'd have point if ZONEACE was around in this thread and posting when the lynch happened...but they weren't.

You yourself pointed out that I was pushing Xisi.<br>\nXisi was my preferred lynch. I wanted Xisi dead.<br>\n<br>\nRondar was a minor scumread. I was convinced into voting him. I did not vote him willingly. And I don't think he had V/LA. If he did, I certainly didn't know about it. Show me where he said he wasn't going to be around, and then show me where anyone points out that he's not around. Then you'll have a potential argument to make, but until then, it's your word versus mine, when I happen to know for a fact that I was not aware Rondar wasn't around.<br>\n<br>\nWhereas I? I have it in my sig. I announced it in-thread. It's a well-documented fact about me, that I'm away during the weekends. <br>\n<br>\nTl;dr?<br>\n<br>\nYou're pushing a minor scumread for junk reasons. You've admitted that the VCA doesn't take into account the context, because the context proves that it was null, not scum as you claim it to be. You're pushing a point which is speculation that I cannot defend against without myself speculating, because it relies on something which neither of us has any knowledge of.

We know his slot is confirmed town so.....wtf?<br>\n<br>\nPoint being...neither of the two examples from this game you provide support your assertion that \"flaking as a scumtell is overrated.\" Do I put a lot of merit in flaking as a scumtell? Not necessarily. But in conjunction with other suspicions I do consider it. And in mastin's case I didn't even consider flaking as a scumtell until you reminded me of the fact he wasn't here D1. So all my points still stand against him PLUS the added bonus that his predecessor flaked. And ZF remained very active elsewhere on the site. He didn't request replacement because his plate was too full (ie Bitmap) and he didn't just suck and replace out due to popular demand (ie absta). ZF legitimately flaked.<br>\n<br>\nAnd there is nothing cicular about my logic that you quote. I don't know for sure wtf scum are. Orc, Xisi, mastin...and to a somewhat lesser degree ThAd are all good candidates IMO. There is no reason mastin can't be scum and if he is...that changes my perspective on my other suspects. Nothing circular about it....just fact. And no...I'm not mafia nor am I posting like mafia. Are you mafia? You certainly aren't confirmed town.

If you haven't provided your case yet I would like to point out that you started promising one over three weeks ago, the <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4681629#p4681629\">day after</a> you voted Xisi and have re-promised one on several occasions...to include over two weeks ago when you said <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4701500#p4701500\">the xisi case was on your laptop.</a><br>\n<br>\nAs for your response to my point that my case on you hasn't been dismantled, I would say using meta to defend your percentage guesstimate is silly and of no value. And I know you have used the 95% assessment in games where you were scum. The example I have was in regards to there being a scum RB and not towards a specific person being scum, but it's still relevant IMO. And I'd love links to a few of your recent scum games if you don't mind...since you like meta. Who do you think is more likely to be scum....xisi or ThAd?<br>\n<br>\nAlso...I agree that at a minimum I am wrong about at least two of the players in the four I suspect (possibly more). But you are wrong in your estimation that I suspect all of them more than I do you. I could probably get on board a Xisi or Orc lynch as an alternative to yours...but as shown by our recent wagon stalemate...I apparently do not favor a ThAd wagon to yours. And as no one else is feeling the orc xisi wagons I have been pushing most of the game...your's is more than sufficient. i.e Not dismantled.<br>\n<br>\nThe fact you can not defend against ZONEFACE's replacement in this game has absolutely nothing to do with the fact he was replaced out of the game while continuing to post actively on the site. It's not reason enough to vote somebody IMO but it is certainly a contributing factor worth consideration. For the record...from the time ZF last posted in this game (Jan 5th) until the time the D1 lynch occurred (Jan 11th)...ZF made ~117 posts on the site. That to me is suspect.<br>\n<br>\nAnd say you were coerced to vote Rondar all you want but IMO you were not coerced. I would consider coercion to be the case when you are 'made' to vote someone you didn't necessarily suspect. To avoid a no lynch perhaps. I would not consider it coercion when someone points out that your lone vote on a wagon is doing no good and you decide to hop on your 2nd suspect's wagon. In fact...4 posts after you vote Rondar all you say on the subject is that <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4671167#p4671167\">Rondar is not your preferred lynch but he's your second suspect...right behind Xisi.</a> That's not fcuking coercion FYI.

First and foremost, life. It leaves enough time for me to read up on my games and to post, but to devote serious time to making the case...not so much. <br>\n<br>\nSecond of all, timing. When night came around, I closed the tab for the Xisi case. I thought it was a done deal, that I would be dead come morning. I was <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">convinced</div> of it. I was absolutely sure I was going to end up dead. (Granted, I have no proof of this, but I'm not lying. I was sure. Dead-certain sure. That I was not living to see day four. The closest I have to proof is that I opened up with nothing but a vote on Xisi. No reasons given, nothing. That's because I was silently weighing things in my mind. As to why I was still alive, and what it implied. But YES. I thought I was living dead during the night. Claim all you'd like that I 'knew' I was going to live, but I. legitimately. honestly. completely. and totally. thought. I. was. dead.)<br>\n<br>\nThird of all, priorities. I've been here before. Been in games with a half-finished case. When I focused solely on the case, know what happened?<br>\n<br>\nI got lynched for working solely on the case.<br>\n<br>\nIf people left me alone, the case would get done. But nope! I have to be suspect #1, suspect #2, suspect #3, and so on. People have to push me. And if I don't push back, I get lynched. Plain and simple. So what do I do? Of course I defend myself, so that I can potentially finish the Xisi case...BUT, I ALSO know that purely defending myself will just get me lynched just as totally ignoring everyone to work on the case will get me lynched.<br>\n<br>\nSo what have I been doing?<br>\n<br>\nRaising valid point after valid point, which people brush off, focusing on hollow statements, statements I have offered logical counters to and been met with...<br>\n...Silence.<br>\n<br>\nI'm a good 75% defense, and 24% short-term offense. The missing 1% is the long-term offense: the case.<br>\nTime management at its worst. I can't do all at the same time. I can't defend myself, while making good points, AND working on the case. It's the \"no more than two\" rule in full effect. You can have 2/3 just fine, but you're pretty much forbidden from having all three in something.<br>\n<br>\nIf people stopped attacking me for (put bluntly) retarded reasoning, then I could stop wasting that extra time on defense, and spend it on the case. If I only had to devote 1% of my time to defense, I could spend 25% of my time on short-term offense as I have been (seriously, read my iso--it already has PLENTY in it against Xisi and ThAd) and 74% of my time on the actual case.<br>\n<br>\nBut nope. I have to respond to bullshit like this. Which of course slows me down.<br>\n<br>\nTime I spend working on responding here is time I am NOT spending working on the case. (\"So why not just work on the case?\" Weren't you listening? Because that'd get me lynched for ignoring the posts, as people think that I can't respond to the points because they're valid, because people think I am lurking, because people think that I'm stalling.<br>\n...Oh, like they're accusing me of doing right now for the case. <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\"> It's lose-lose.

I use them just as often (if not moreso) as town! What does that make it? Null.

That it's on town? Or that it's on scum?<br>\nWhat does a wagon which builds literally overnight and continues to reform (with plenty of interested parties not on currently but willing to be on) over and over again tell you? That it's on town? (Hint: yes.) Or that it's on scum? <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>The fact you can not defend against ZONEFACE's replacement in this game has absolutely nothing to do with the fact he was replaced out of the game while continuing to post actively on the site.</div></blockquote> Except it is. You're pushing an argument that is speculative...which I have no way of defending against without myself speculating. There is no way to provide a defense based off of things in-thread, because the entire argument relies on things outside of the thread.<br>\n<br>\nYou're, once again, pushing that ZONEACE, as scum, replaced out because their scumbuddy was under fire, and continued to remain active on site.<br>\nThis isn't a fact. Zone posting elsewhere is a fact, yes. But the conclusion from it is entirely speculation. Far too often, people have made this accusation. I've been in 100+ games. I've made the accusation myself. It's often proven wrong, 'cause guess what? We're not mindreaders. We can't see into the minds of the replaced and know why they wanted out. I'm bluntly saying this argument is bullshit.<br>\n<br>\nThe only--and I do say, ONLY--way that it could have merit is if you had stats which showed people replacing out yet remaining active across the site were scum in said replaced slot...while also showing that people replacing out yet remaining active across the site did not do so often in a town slot. So go show me that. Quite frankly, I don't think you'll even try, because you'll quickly find it's either about equal or even the opposite of what you claim.<br>\n<br>\nIn newbies? Sure. Yeah. Replacing out yet remaining active means that you had a reason to replace out, and it is generally \"I panicked\".<br>\nBut ZONEACE is no newbie. A veteran will NEVER replace out because they're in a bad situation. Not unless they want to catch flak for strategic replacement. Even so much as CONSIDERING it will get you a lot of bad attention. (See also, GvE, CvL.) So they never, EVER would do it as you are claiming Zone to have done.<br>\n<br>\nAnd I'll repeat it as many times as necessary. It was not relevant to this game. It was null.

You, fitz, failed to meet my basic requirement of no links (I don't read links. Haven't in over two years. When I do, it's the exception proving the rule) when making your case, and had you listened to my request, there is a VERY real chance I would have voted Orcinus, not Rondar, on day two, because I saw something scummy from Orcinus. I saw something which looked like it may be good. It catapulted Orcinus from being town to being <div style=\"display:inline-flex;text-decoration:line-through\">on the wrong side of null</div> (errm...my bad. to being null-town; before this, Orcinus was a solid townread of mine). Pretty much EQUAL WITH RONDAR. So why didn't I? Why wasn't my vote on Orcinus?

I felt cheated. I felt fooled. I felt like I had been tricked. I felt like I was manipulated. I felt as if someone else had pulled my strings. And to me, that's coercion. Doing something I would not do by being forced into it. I was compelled into it, but it was not willingly. And I realize this doesn't entirely make rational sense, but that's the whole deal with coercion, in that it's only effective if you don't realize it's there.

It worked because I was given enough time to know the PRs of the setup and custom-craft my claim to fit in...and even then, my claim had a huge element of guessing correctly the actions.

Decent chance hes maf, and if hes an SK then hes unlikely to get NK'd anytime soon anyways.<br>\n<br>\nAll THAT said, the VT claim is more reason I want to lynch Admiral today.

So mastin/{me/Bacde} or Admiral/{orcinus/xis}?  Which narrows your suspect pool down not at all.<br>\n<br>\nI guess I see your logic, but I don't think its that black/white.  If they really are both town, its totally possible scum are afraid to cluster on the same ML wagon (possibly right next to each other?  if you think its Bacde/Mastin)  And really I dont see why scum would be rushing to ML necessarily as opposed to just, I dunno, dragging the day out and trying to not derp-hammer like that. &gt;.&gt;.<br>\n<br>\nOn a semi-related note.  Im starting to think Orcinus is a good vote.  I have pretty reasonable townreads on everyone that isn't Fitz/Orcinus/Admiral and Orcinus's recent shenanigans just seem off.  Bacde isn't getting lynched today.  Its like hes riding the \"Ya I might be the arsonist\" wave with the OMGUS.  Thats kind of a gut/paranoia fueled read, but eh.  I definitely don't have a townread on that slot.<br>\n<br>\nThat said, I strongly doubt Orcinus/Fitz are a team given the absurd walls that they had back and forth on D1.  Its possible one is SK and one is Maf. but I think I'd rather lynch ThAdmiral since there is almost no way Orc/Fitz are team.  I don't know Fitz to be one to bus so aggressively anyways.  Actually talking about Fitz from D1 is making me rememver why I thought he was town in the first place.  So I might bw down to lynch Orcinus today.  Decent chance hes maf, and if hes an SK then hes unlikely to get NK'd anytime soon anyways.<br>\n<br>\nAll THAT said, the VT claim is more reason I want to lynch Admiral today.  We likely have one more PR out there and I strongly believe there to be a doctor that I would rather not force to claim.  Im guessing Vifam is only alive because scum also fear a doctor role.

So many of his friends had already met an untimely demise, and he wouldn't be next. He was surrounded by cold blooded killers and didn't trust anybody. Xisiqomelir quickly threw some essential supplies into a backpack and stole away into the dark of night.<br>\n<br>\nAs he passed by Vifam's house he saw two shadowy figures slip into the front door. Little Vifam was in trouble! Xisiqomelir couldn't just leave behind an innocent child. After gathering all of his courage, he pressed on towards the house. He could smell the scent of gasoline and knew he didn't have much time to act.<br>\n<br>\nXisiqomelir peeked inside a window and saw the back of a young boy tied to a chair, surrounded by sticks of dynamite. The shady figures were nowhere in sight. Perhaps they forgot their blowtorches? He still had time, what a stroke of luck! Xisiqomelir slipped inside the house and hurried to the side of Vifam. He started to untie the boy and patted his hair. \"Don't be scared, I'll get you out of here.\"<br>\n<br>\nThen the mop fell off Vifam's head. It wasn't Vifam at all! The child was a fake. In the doll's hands was a note that read, \"We knew you'd run. You're no match for us!\"<br>\n<br>\nAs Xisiqomelir repeatedly hit his head against the wall after reading the terrible 'match' pun, he heard the lock to the door click shut. Moments later, a molotov cocktail sailed through the window.<br>\n<br>\nThe fire spread across the floor lined with gasoline, and quickly reached the pile of stacked dynamite.</div><br>\n<br>\n<iframe width=\"420\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/zsTRxXvQY0s\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#0040BF\">Xisiqomelir,</div> <div style=\"display:inline;color:#008000\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vanilla Townie</div></div><div style=\"display:inline;color:#0040BF\">, ASPLODED Night 5</div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#0040BF\">Vifam,</div> <div style=\"display:inline;color:#008000\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Town Innocent Child</div></div><div style=\"display:inline;color:#0040BF\">, ENDGAMED</div><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#0040BF\">orcinus_theoriginal,</div> <div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF8000\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Arsonist</div></div><div style=\"display:inline;color:#0040BF\">, ENDGAMED</div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#0040BF\">AngryPidgeon,</div> <div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF0000\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Mafia Roleblocker</div></div><div style=\"display:inline;color:#0040BF\">, mastin2,</div> <div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF0000\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Mafia Goon</div></div><div style=\"display:inline;color:#0040BF\">, and Ztife,</div> <div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF0000\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Mafia Goon</div></div><div style=\"display:inline;color:#0040BF\">, have won Mini 1408: Playing with Fire.</div>", "time": "Thu Mar 07, 2013 7:34 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=24640&start=1525", "forum": "53", "thread": "24640"}
