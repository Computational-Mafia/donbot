Suddenly, all the alarms in the mall went off, and all but 14 people escaped, with a number of them criminals. They ran in masked, and once everyone starting running around in panic, they ducked into a nearby shop, took the masks off, and faked being helpless shoppers, scared to death by the masked men. Although, they didn't leave the mall. They blended in real good, but wouldn't exit the mall. After most people had exited the mall, they shut all the doors leading in and out of the mall, quickly ducked back into the shop, put the masks on, and came back out with loaded guns. They drugged everyone, all except a man named <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Moneybags</div>, who wouldn't drink the poison. They threatened to kill him, if he didn't drink it in the next minute, and when the minute was up, and all the sparkly, purple liquid was still in the little cup, they shot him to death. They found he was a secret agent, who escaped the wrath of the Mafia, back in some town called MafiaScum Village. When everyone woke back up after being drugged, the -- now unmasked -- men said they were saints, and could withstand any poison, sort of like that old creep, Rasputin did, back in Russia, and told everyone that a number of the men left -- which was only 13 -- were criminals, faking being one of the helpless shoppers or clerks still trapped. They also said that the criminals created a little game, where each day, everyone could search for them, and each night, they got to kill one remaining person. The last thing they said was that the criminals had them trapped, and were forced to play the game. So everyone did.</div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Steve:</div> They've got us all trapped. How they've managed to trap us, yet stay hidden from cops and officials themselves, especially in the beautiful, yet busy and bustling country of Italy, I can't say. But we need help; they've got us trapped. They say we can kill one person everyday, and try to kill them. They also say that every night they get to kill one remaining person. Since we're trapped, we're forced to play this horrid game. We need help fast!<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Steve</div> tried to send this video, from a video camera he somehow was able to smuggle with him into one of the shops, but no one ever received it. The criminals weren't stupid, and they didn't forget to cut off all wifi and cell phone connections, either. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Steve</div> was downright trapped, and was utterly forced to play the game.</div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Anastasia:</div> Oh Lord, how are we going to survive? I've got a baby on the way, so we need to get out of here fast, else one of you people will be delivering a baby. Oh Lord... why? Why, why, why?<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Anastasia</div> was <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Moneybags</div>' wife, although once she was drugged, she could not remember this, nor did she feel anything for his murder. She only knew she was pregnant, and had to get out of there fast, before some knucklehead had to deliver the baby for her.</div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Mr. Simmons:</div> Ma'am, please. We're going to be fine, we just need to find a way out of here. Anyone got any ideas?<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Catherine:</div> Well, maybe we'll just have to play the game. Nothing great will come out it, but it seems that's our only real option. As much as I hate it, I'll take my chances and play.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Steve:</div> This woman, <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Catherine</div>, is it, seems right about this. As much as it is stupid, as much as it is necessary for us to play the game, and get out of here. I think we should do it.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">And with that, <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Steve</div> and the other 12 remaining people decided they would play the terrible game.</div></div>", "time": "Fri Jun 22, 2012 10:25 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=22466&start=0", "forum": "53", "thread": "22466"}

The weather just added to the beauty. But there were some parts of Italy that didn't wake up on the right side of the bed this morning... some places such as the mall. Alas, everyone awoke, to see 13 people -- a number of them the \"saints\" -- ready and prepared to play the ridiculous game.<br>\n<br>\nThe \"saints\" had went into a small restaurant at the north side of the mall the day before, where they had come out with food and beverage for everyone. They assured everyone that this was the last day that anything said could be trusted. Tomorrow, the game would start, and lies would be flying around like flies. They told everyone to eat up for the big day tomorrow, and so they did. This morning, they had gone into the same restaurant, gotten more food and beverage for everyone, and came back to the central part of the mall, where everyone else was at. They again told everyone to eat up for the big day today, although none of them held a straight face. Most of the hostages were highly suspicious of them.</div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Steve:</div> I'm not eating or drinking anything else.

It's common knowledge that your voice and your vote are the two weapons every townie possesses. I chose to use my voice because I wanted to test how you would deal with the pressure. A town player would've remained composed and continued scumhunting, instead of your kneejerk defense mechanism. So far your only contributions to town discussion have been a rather lackluster \"pressure\" attack on Matias, and a bombastic string of OMGUS defensive posts against me. <br>\n<br>\nBad logic, quite correctly, isn't a scum tell. Inconsistencies, however, are. If someone cannot explain why they make the decisions they do to the rest of the town, then there is reason to believe they have access to other sources of information (e.g. masons, scum, investigative roles later). As stated in my original post (if you hadn't merely bolded the word null and skipped my justification, I wouldn't have to go over this again), I do not have a strong feeling that dr has been acting scummy, but that his lack of logic as opposed to providing reasoning muddies the water and makes things more difficult to work out.<br>\n<br>\nNow, so as to not get distracted with this needless bickering, can you provide some real reasons for your actions? So far your hostility towards Matias you then dismissed as soon as it was put under scrutiny as \"pressure testing\", and then towards me in a OMGUS fashion. Other than that you've had two town reads, both of which come from your \"gut\". While I agree that gut reads exist, and that everyone uses them, I'm sure there must be some reasons you think dr and Dann are town. Even if dr's bad logic isn't scummy, that doesn't make it town play, and someone not scumhunting (as I said Dann seemed to have alluded to in him posting that he hadn't read Page 3), is AT BEST poor town play, at worst scum hiding in the open.

That being said, his reactions have muddied the waters and his sarcasm is easily misinterpreted; I would prefer it if he instead took a well-reasoned approach to things, as the way he is posting now is directing virtually everyone's attention and causing a mass tunnelling. <br>\n<br>\nDannflor - Null leaning scum. Again, not much to go off of here, but his late joining on the drmyshotgun bandwagon, combined with some hypocritical action \"you seem to want to pile the votes on Matias as quick as possible\" followed by adding yet another vote to drmyshotgun is flawed logic (but, I acknowledge, not necessarily scummy). I didn't like the post where he hadn't bothered to read page 3 - it smells like a lack of interest in scumhunting. All of this being said, however, the sample size is small, but I would encourage everyone to watch his next few posts and ensure some real scumhunting.<br>\n<br>\nAngryPidgeon - Scum. I have already gone into detail as to why above.<br>\n<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nSo these are the two players other than me that he feels strongly about.  And I use the word 'strongly' very lightly here.  He prefaces his read on them with 'null' indicating that he really doesn't feel either way about these players.  The drmyshotgun analysis contradicts itself.  McStab says Drmyshotgun leans scum and then IMMEDIATELY says Drmyshotgun hasn't actually done anything scummy.  He clarifies by saying that Drmyshotgun isn't really scum, but is just playing poorly.  Then he further contradicts himself by saying that DR's recklessness is actually a town tell.  So he starts off by saying Dr leans scum.  Then he admits that Dr isn't scum but rather is simply not playing well.  Then he even goes so far as to say that DR's posting tone leans town.  He basically just gave us 3 different opinions of Drmyshotgun.  He is completely unable to take a stance on dr whatsoever.  In fact, he can't even get on a 2 sentence streak of holding down the same opinion of Dr.  His opinion of Dr changed that fast.  How can you say he gave a scum read here?  He sat on the Dr fence harder than anyone I have ever seen fence sit.<br>\n<br>\nAs for his analysis of Dannflor, he once again prefaces his read with 'null'.  He then says there isn't much to go on here.  He makes a small token case against Dannflor and then quickly dismisses it by saying there simply isn't enough to go off of.  Ultimately, McStab has refused to take a stand on anyone except me.  He subconsciously knows that he is tunneling me and actively denies doing it despite the fact that no one has really accused him of it.  The fact remains that I am the only person he is willing to take even a small stand on.  His DR 'scum read' was the biggest bullshit possible.  He did actually make a slight case for Dannflor but then conceded that he really didn't have anything to go off of.<br>\n<br>\nThe ONLY non-scummy thing I see in McStab right now is that he is at least willing to take a stand on me.<br>\n<br>\nDid you even read his post Monkey?<br>\nMatias, what is your opinion of Arugula?", "time": "Sun Jun 24, 2012 7:44 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=22466&start=75", "forum": "53", "thread": "22466"}

When you only have one player (Matias, at the time) whom you can target because he is active, it is a Day One necessity. If others (namely, according to you, myself) do it, it is \"tunnelling\". When I am unwilling to outright condemn players and instead post a general sense towards them, it is \"fence-sitting\". When you change your mind on Matias (for no reason but a different gut instinct - it's weird how much stuff you can get away with when you have a flip-flopping gut) it is because the situation has changed, as opposed to you \"fence-sitting\".<br>\n<br>\nAs for my drmyshotgun views, I did, perhaps, word it wrong - null leaning poor town play is perhaps a more concise term that I should've used. However, you're attempting to create wedge issues where there isn't any. Very rarely does someone have the luxury to be certain that an individual is scum or town, and even less so on Day One. That is why a potent weapon the town possesses is it's voice. Discussion, and making observations on players, is the only way to eliminate the scum's advantage. Once the majority becomes informed and can make logical decisions, the scum lose their advantage. <br>\n<br>\nThroughout this game you've sought to eliminate discussion. Rather than viewing each player and their attitudes as a complex individual capable of lying and slipping up at different points, you assume that one must either view them as scum or town. While eventually (by the time we have to lynch) that is the case, one doesn't need to condemn an individual as straight scum or straight town early in Day One. My views towards drmyshotgun and Dannflor are that they have made some moves that could be considered scummy, however I am unprepared to declare them scum or town at this point in time. Rather than keep my views and my points to myself, I seek to put them out in the open so as to see their reactions, others reactions, and see if other people have views towards my observations. <br>\n<br>\nYou seem to condemn anyone who doesn't directly take a determined, unchanged position on other players. In my mind, someone who does this is more scummy - they are more certain, and are likely more informed. It's a ridiculous world where someone can yell \"flip flopper\" or \"fence sitter\" and immediately this quality is seen as scum - simplicity DOESN'T = TOWN. Simplicity = Simplicity, nothing more, nothing less. Likewise, complexity DOESN'T = SCUM. Complexity = Complexity, and anyone who can claim, at this point in the game, that they are absolutely certain and not changing their position on another player, is either deluded, scum, or a poor town player.", "time": "Sun Jun 24, 2012 8:03 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=22466&start=75", "forum": "53", "thread": "22466"}

He strikes me as someone trying to make friends with townies instead of find scum.  On day 1 he asked me my opinion of Slandaar and when I didn't give it he asked again.  Slandaar had only posted to request a wagon on me at that point in the game, so Matias was expecting me to have a negativ opinion of him.  By asking me for it, Matias is hoping I will complain to him about Slandaar and thus subconsciously think of Matias as a friend.

I'm going to ISO the most scummy people in the game, and maybe a few lurkurs too. First up... Maestro.<br>\n<br>\nHe came in on post 69, simply agreeing with everyone else and generally saying that dr seemed scummy. EXACTLY the same thing as others had been saying. In his next post he copies me and says the exact same thing, voting dr after that. I can't determine to much from that, he didn't really contribute at all and simply repeated other peoples posts. However, it could be simply that he joined in late and hadn't really formed any opinion of his own and started sheeping. Either way, it's kind of scummy.<br>\n<br>\nPost #77 was rather odd, again not contributing and only trying to <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">make</div> dr angry and thus gain more grounds to lynch him. He didn't post anything of importance after that. <br>\n<br>\nIt's hard to judge with so little posts from him, but he's playing rather scummy. Simply trying to draw dr out and pile onto his wagon. I'd say he is leaning scum, I have to wait until he posts more for a definite read.<br>\n<br>\nTaking into account Maestro's scummy behaviour, I think I will re-ISO dr, and see if my vote should change. <br>\n<br>\nIn post #36 dr voted Matias, agreeing with AngryPidgeon. dr doesn't nessecairilly state his reasons for voting Matias, and seems to just want to jump on someones wagon. His next few posts are just shit. They don't even make any sense. First he claims he voted Matias because he thought that Matias posted to much. This is stupid. Then he starts insulting implosion and votes him for no reason. His next couple posts are just more insults and nonsense. And then... more nonsense. After which I vote him for his scummy behavior. <br>\n<br>\nPost #76 is just trying to defend himself unsuccessfully, to this point in the game he still hasn't contributed to the game. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4144305#p4144305\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4144305#p4144305\" data-post-id=\"4144305\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 89</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=18289\">drmyshotgun</a> wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4144018#p4144018\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4144018#p4144018\" data-post-id=\"4144018\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 77</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=18802\">Maestro</a> wrote:</cite>Hahaha!

I feel like he saw what could be construed as fencesitting, and made a choice to construe it as fencesitting in an attempt to get an easy push-monkey (by which i mean, so that he could just keep pushing matias without having to worry about voting for others). I also dislike his posting a list of half the game who he wants to lynch. I had him as scum, but there was one thing in 116 that gave me pause - specifically, his reads on mcstab/angrypigeon. The logic is kind of bad, but it feels genuine.

Way too apologetic. He regrets making the drmy vote after unvoting... really, as town, he has no reason to regret a vote that he can simply unvote. Being overly apologetic is a scumtell. And then in 138, he has a classic scumtell: the need to comment on everything. Like, just read this sentence. <blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><br>\nA lot of RVS, nothing much here, besides implosions vote on Slaandar, stating that his post sounds forced and that it's a gut feeling. Nothing mush more.</div></blockquote>It just isn't genuine. Townies comment on what they find relevant; he clearly does not find this relevant. There are some other gems in that post too, such as: <blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>In this post dr basically states that he had no reasoning for his vote on Matias, as if he just voted because he wanted to. Perhaps scum trying to get an easy lynch?<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div> Perhaps scum are trying to get an easy lynch! perhaps they aren't! <div style=\"display:inline-flex;text-decoration:line-through\">drmy is scum. Or not, i'm a sign, not a cop</div> In essence the phrasing is just really, really bad. Too many qualifiers (basically, perhaps).

He makes this post DIRECTLY underneath Arugula's post in which he did the same thing.  Also, Arugula has been theorizing about scum-teams all game.  From what I can tell, Andrew believes Dannflor to be scummy partly because of this:<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4151010#p4151010\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4151010#p4151010\" data-post-id=\"4151010\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 221</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=19042\">Dannflor</a> wrote:</cite>Now for my theory, I think Maestro and dr are scum buddies, just bussing each other.

I will keep my vote on dr, and will be happy to lynch Maestro tomorrow.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nMeanwhile, Arugula has been doing this sort of shit all game and Andrew did not comment on it once.  In post 245 I was asking Andrew about Arugula's post to see if he would reach the same conclusion about it that he did Dann's.  He DID acknowledge that he dislikes Arugula's lynch queue, but only after I directly pointed him to the post.  I feel that Andrew knew why I asked the question and gave me the answer he felt would best satisfy me.  Even still, he didn't add Arugula to his list of scum.  Instead he just kind of made an off-handed remark about disliking Arugula's proposed lynch queue.  Also as I said, Arugula has been posting about scum-teams all Day.  Why did Andrew ignore this scum-tell for Arugula but then crusade against Dann for it?<br>\n<br>\nHere is my list of everyone in the game, sorted from most to least scummy:<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><br>\nScummy:<br>\nMonkeyMan576 - Encouraged me to keep arguing with McStab in post 92 by referring me back to one of Scum's posts instead of arguing with me directly.  Accuses me of being defensive when I am being aggressive.  Accuses me of targeting implosion which I had not done at that point.  Also sat on the fence hardcore about me.  These last two things were in post 164.<br>\nandrew94 - Selectively applying tells, lurking, asking me if I think he is town which gives me a gut scum read<br>\nMatias - Lots of fencesitting, quick to get on perceived easy lynch wagons, trying to buddy me early game<br>\n<br>\nSlightly scummy but not too much to go off of:<br>\nimplosion - this is mostly gut, but...Complimenting Slandaar for some stupid reason in post 117.

I feel as though scum would stay focused on a series of attacks on them or at least show more hesitancy in making points against players.<br>\n<br>\nArugula's posts have been focused against Matias, and considering how hard he's pushed for lynching Matias (which isn't particularly popular with other players) I really doubt he's scum (presumably scum would go for an easier lynch on an already existing wagon). Furthermore he's been looking for scum links and that's a trait I generally consider to be townish.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nTechnoWC has also had logically sound posts, and his reads seem to match with many of my own. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\nSlandaar and My Milked Eek are null for me at the moment.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\ndrmyshotgun is coming across as town to me, his aggression and the fact that he's maintained well under pressure the entire game has convinced me that he isn't scum. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\nRight now I think that Maestro and Dannflor are the two scummiest players.  <br>\n<br>\nDann has been wishy-washy the whole time and easily folded to pressure. See posts #251, #230, #223 (where he dismisses his theory after a single post questions it), #108 (where he unvotes drmy), #138 (where he revotes and changes his decision back to drmy after pressure is laid on drmy) and #248. <br>\n<br>\nThere's a difference between being nervous and being uncertain, and I smell nervousness in all of these posts. I seriously encourage everyone to ISO Dan and see how often he changes his mind and tries to avoid attention and controversy. <br>\n<br>\nAs for Maestro, it appears obvious to me that he was baiting drmyshotgun into trying to respond emotionally (and he was rather successful) - see posts #77 and #79. Keep in mind that drmyshotgun was the main wagon at the time and this strikes me as scum trying to convince drmy to say something in the heat of the moment that could be used to falsely incriminate him. I also find his apologetic nature to be suspect, but I'm not sure how far that can really be taken.<br>\n<br>\nBetween the both of them, I find dann scummier though. His vibe for me this whole game has been that of scum.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nOf interesting note, as well, is that both of them have failed to say much of note about Monkey, and played it off as a mistake (despite him being a major wagon at the moment). See Maestro's posts #240 and Dann's post #248. I also don't really like his logic \"because he is the other wagon\". Not because he strikes Dann as scummy, but because he's just the other wagon - it may seem small but that is a very telling statement about the way Dann is seeing the game (in terms of who is likely to be lynched, as opposed to who is scum).<br>\n<br>\nThe way I see it right now is that one of the following scenarios is happening (there are obv. other possibilities, but this is how I see it):<br>\n<br>\n2 Scum Scenarios -<br>\n<br>\n1. Dannflor and Maestro are both scum bussing each other D1. Strikes me as unlikely though - I think if one turns scum the other is likely clear, or vice versa. Monkey is innocent.<br>\n<br>\n2. Dannflor or Maestro is scum - one is innocent, one is scum. Monkey is a likely scumpartner with the guilty one.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n3 Scum Scenarios <br>\n<br>\n1. Dannflor or Maestro are scum - Monkey and another player is their partner.<br>\n<br>\n2. Dannflor and Maestro are bussing each other, Monkey is innocent, the other two scum are elsewhere.<br>\n<br>\n3. Dannflor, Maestro and Monkey are scum together. Dannflor and Maestro are bussing each other while Monkey tries to avoid attention.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nAs for what I recommend our course of action is, we lynch either Dannflor or Maestro today (in my mind, Dannflor - he strikes me as scummier than Maestro). His flip gives us more of an idea on drmyshotgun and Maestro. With all of that in mind, we see how things are progressing but either lynch Monkey, or, if it seems more prudent, we lynch Maestro/drmyshotgun (based off of Dannflor's flip). A monkey lynch today is better than most other candidates, but we don't get as much information from his flip than we would from Dannflor. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: Dannflor</div>", "time": "Thu Jun 28, 2012 8:15 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=22466&start=250", "forum": "53", "thread": "22466"}

Your bolded statement is assuming that Matias did not fence sit (or at least not very much) and that premise falls apart when you actually look at the Matias ISO done in post 116.

He basically bussed Matias, didn't want it to go too far, and jumped off at any point that he could, which happened to be McStab's post.

I agree with most of his reasoning actually, but him and Matias as scum partners fits too well to ignore.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\nArugula's ENTIRE point about me hinges on me and Matias being a scum team.  You evidently believe Matias is town because you disliked Arugula's post about him so much, but you like Arugula's post about me which is all about me/Matias being scum together.  If you dislike Arugula's point about Matias then you must automatically dislike his point about me being Matias's scum buddy by default.  It makes absolutely 0 sense for you to like his point about me but dislike his point about Matias.  So why did you say it?  You are 1) trying to associate Matias with me so that when he flips scum I get lynched, and 2) encouraging Arugula to start pressuring me again despite having a town-read on me.  We can't assume you are town aligned anymore because your motives for making this post do not exist in that event.<br>\n<br>\nThen the ONLY player you list as scum is Dannflor and you don't even bother voting for him again.  At least you provided some form of case for him this time (even if I disagree with the logic), but YOU DIDN'T VOTE HIM??<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nFinally, implosion's last post is after Aru and I have accused him of being scummy.  Instead of justifying his post in the slightest or responding at all, he provokes drmyshotgun.  His post is useless.  He is hoping to draw drmy's aggressive posts on to him so he can point out how scummy drmy sounds instead of defending himself from Arugula and me.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">tl;dr: lynch the scum.</div>", "time": "Fri Jun 29, 2012 3:42 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=22466&start=275", "forum": "53", "thread": "22466"}

Funny story, it's also a very common town strategy. I thought slandaar's reaction to my vote on him was a towntell. When i say \"slandaar's reaction was good\" it's pretty fucking clear that that's what i meant. As for not justifying the vote, that's a fair point. I guess i just wasn't really in the mood to justify it. Yeah, feel free to call this explanation scummy, but it's the truth. <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Now he unvotes Dann for slightly less nebulous reasons than voting for him in the first place and parks his vote on another person without really telling us why. If you ISO'd Maestro, then why not point us to a quote of his that is scummy? Implosion has now voted for two players without providing any concrete explanation for his vote and her certainly didn't try and make a case for why these players are scummy. He was the 4th vote both times, so I am having a hard time believing he is purely pressure voting. I can only conclude that he is scum and looking to lynch townies who are having difficulties defending themselves.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\nSee the part where i said \"i'm feeling lazy today?\" Also, see the part where i said maestro was a \"fine vote?\" That vote was essentially me not wanting to vote dannflor, and not really being in the mood to find the best vote. It isn't pressure voting, it's just... voting. Really, I didn't have any specific intent with that vote. Not really to pressure, just to have a vote down on someone who i don't think is town. <br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>WHAT EVIDENCE DO YOU HAVE OF THE BOLDED STATEMENT? Evidence of fence-sitting is not subjective. Matias DID fence-sit and Arugula pointed it all out in his Matias ISO. Whether or not someone fence-sat is NOT an opinion. there is solid evidence of Matias doing it and you cannot deny it. Your bolded statement is assuming that Matias did not fence sit (or at least not very much) and that premise falls apart when you actually look at the Matias ISO done in post 116. What I don't understand is that you did not even remotely try and back up your assertion that Arugula's push was not genuine. You base this claim on the idea that Matias never actually fence-sat which we already know is false.</div></blockquote><br>\nha. you just said that a tell in mafia is objective... silly. First of all, whether matias fencesat is subjective; second of all, even if you think he did, whether it's a scumtell is subjective. I don't think he did; really, if changing a read in the way Matias did is fencesitting, then I'd have a tough time finding a game where no townies \"fencesat.\" I can deny it. You saying that I can't deny it doesn't magically mean that I can't deny it. <br>\n<br>\n<fieldset style=\"border:3px outset grey;padding:5px 10px\"><legend style=\"text-transform:uppercase;margin:0 0.6em;padding:0em 0.33em\">me denying it</legend><blockquote><div><cite><a href=\"http://www.thefreedictionary.com/fence-sitting\" class=\"postlink\">The dictionary</a> wrote:</cite>fence sitter<br>\nn.

Fencesitting is NOT, and get this past your head, NOT, changing your position. <br>\n<br>\nArugula's first accusation was in 80. <br>\n<br>\nHere's a list of pre-80 posts from Matias that I can construe in any way as fencesitting.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I do believe that Arugula's switch onto the wagon is strange in a way, despite the need of Pidgeon needing a wagon.

Towards implosion, and towards andrew.</div></blockquote><br>\nHim saying that he's putting no stock into specific arguments is, also, not fencesitting. He's given clear opinions by this point in the game, and it still isn't even through page two - opinions really shouldn't be solid. And yes, he states in post 60 that he's giving his first hard read of the game - it really shouldn't be noteworthy that someone has no strong reads until page three. Like he said, there's a difference between being wishy-washy (or fencesitting) and it being 2 pages into the game, you not having strong reads. <br>\n<br>\nSo yes, i guess you're right, Matias has fencesat, in the same way that fox news makes attempts to hide that they are a right-wing news organization: it's completely irrelevant to what he actually is.</fieldset><br>\nI find an attack on Matias for fencesitting based on the above to be scummy. Sue me. Furthermore, \"what can be construed as fencesitting\" is probably a little poorly worded; it should include the word \"scummy\" before fencesitting. It's difficult to back up the assertion that a push isn't genuine, and it should be obvious why I think it isn't genuine. I think it wasn't genuine because I don't think a townie would have made that particular push. As for post 116... well, the above spoiler explains why that isn't fencesitting, or at least, isn't even vaguely scummy. Like I said: you SHOULDN'T have strong reads on everyone on page two. Sure, there are people (hell, i've done it before) who make reads-lists of everyone who's posted on page 1-2. When I (or i presume others) do that, i'm doing it with the knowledge that all of those reads will very likely wind up changing. Just because Matias said that his reads were going to change, doesn't mean that he was scum fencesitting. <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Arugula's ENTIRE point about me hinges on me and Matias being a scum team. You evidently believe Matias is town because you disliked Arugula's post about him so much, but you like Arugula's post about me which is all about me/Matias being scum together. If you dislike Arugula's point about Matias then you must automatically dislike his point about me being Matias's scum buddy by default. It makes absolutely 0 sense for you to like his point about me but dislike his point about Matias. So why did you say it? You are 1) trying to associate Matias with me so that when he flips scum I get lynched, and 2) encouraging Arugula to start pressuring me again despite having a town-read on me. We can't assume you are town aligned anymore because your motives for making this post do not exist in that event.</div></blockquote><br>\nLet me explain something that should be really obvious.<br>\nWhen I say that I like something from someone in a post where i'm specifically elaborating on my read of that person, <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">i am not saying that I agree with the thing that I like. I am saying that I like it in that I find it to be a towntell.</div> <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Then the ONLY player you list as scum is Dannflor and you don't even bother voting for him again.

Smearing, is. Subtle difference but with very different results. Smearing causes people to react scummily and post incoherently (anger) so that they look scummy, whereas aggro is determined play that pulls reads out of people. As long as an aggro player is willing to concede when a player looks town, that's fine by me. I don't really like drmy's earlier case on Implosion nor his vote hopping (lynch lynch cmon lynch), but while this isn't great play, I find generally his play more eager town than sly sneaky scum voting with wishy washy reads.<br>\nArugula is a tricky one. I disagree with some of his reads, particularly his AP one. His earlier posts on a potential scumteam between Matias and AP had me wondering, but AP's logic is impeccable. If AP is actually scum, he's playing a mean game. But he is active and has mostly good reads. And I've seen him play scum and he is very different here, more vocal.

A few questions raised and some townreads, and that was it. And I personally put heavy weight on meta, probably more so than most people on this site. Meta is very important. Mafia is more than one game, it is a connection of games intertwined. Every player has their own individual scumtells and towntells.<br>\n<br>\nSure, good players know how to adapt their playstyles and change them, so I take meta with a grain of salt, but average/nooby players do not. And dann, sorry to say, is not the stunning example of play. It would be good to have some mafia meta on him, but his town meta speaks volumes. The dann we have here is one and the same dann we have in the linked game.<br>\n<br>\nDann is a likely mislynch and you basically tunneled him. What were your other scumreads?

You give no justification on why you think Matias is town, and I don't know how you can still be getting \"initial impressions\" 350 posts in on the number one wagon (Monkey) right now.

The wallposts comment is related to playstyle, not alignment. You essentially said the same thing about Maestro in your post, I just used the words \"only time will tell\". It is a difference in semantics, and you're trying to manufacture it.<br>\n<br>\nThe only thing in this post that you contributed to scumhunting was your post about Maestro, which still results in a blank \"null\". <br>\n<br>\nYou better post that explanation about why you think Monkey is town fast, because if you genuinely think that, you probably don't have long to convince us before he gets hammered.

His read justifications are... okay. Meh. Really, there's nothing that I see as a strong tell either way. Parroting really isn't a tell for the reasons that he gave - if someone has an opinion that happens to match someone else's opinion, doesn't mean it's parroting (plus i don't think parroting is particularly scummy in general so). <br>\n<br>\nMatias - Town. <br>\n<br>\nMcStab - null leaning scum. Something about his post 85 reads is off. First of all, his drmy read - the way that he, rather than criticizing drmy's play, suggested that he change it (i would prefer x) is awkward. I feel like the reasoning is a bit convoluted too. Note that I'm not suggesting a mcstab-drmy scumteam here. Saying that only time will let him read maestro also feels like overjustification for what is basically a read of \"null, he hasn't made any tells.\" This isn't a very strong scumread, though.

Tired.</div></blockquote><br>\nYour read on me is encouraging...? I think...?<br>\nI'm guessing the meta-investigation you speak of occurred when I linked a game for Slandaar - who has yet to post any response in the form of metanalysis from the game he asked for.<br>\n<br>\nAs far as his drmyshotgun read goes, I'd like to say that I think the post you mentioned is just part of his playstyle, which is very different from and opposite to mine. I've been reading a lot of meta on drmy to try and completely convince myself that he was scum and I think that because of what I found I will actually have to <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">UNVOTE: drmyshotgun</div>. <br>\n<br>\nMy reasoning behind this (which is not, as Slandaar says, \"trying to buddy with him\") is that in several games like this one (<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=52&amp;t=21393&amp;start=175\" class=\"postlink\">http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.ph ... &amp;start=175</a>) he plays as scum and is much more reserved, especially when compared to his playstyle in this game so far. (For a prime example, see post 175 and 184 in the linked game. They're both on the page I linked to in that game and the worst thing he says is \"douche\"...whereas we've had several \"fuck you's\" per page for a little while.) I put a lot of faith in playstyle, sometimes more than in content, but I feel that it's a matter of opinion. Several others have discounted this but I've always felt that sometimes even more importantly than what people say is <div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">how</div> they say it.<br>\n<br>\nI can link to other meta examples of the same if people want them. <br>\n<br>\nI'd also like to hear more about your reasoning behind the MonkeyMan vote, seeing as that is probably the most important thing going on right now. Also on that note, I completely understand the MonkeyMan wagon that is going down right now, but he's already claimed (albeit with a flimsy if not nonexistent case) so I feel like something more concrete in his own defense would be the only thing to help him at this point. I'm down for the wagon but I realize I came in a little late to do anything but reread and hammer after he says something more in his own defense.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">NO VOTE</div>", "time": "Sun Jul 01, 2012 7:36 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=22466&start=350", "forum": "53", "thread": "22466"}

For instance, his most recent post (344) really sums up what i think is a genuine state of mind with regards to drmy. Something like that can explain away the two quotes above, as well. I also frankly like the way that he claimed. It feels a lot like town annoyed that the town isn't listening. The claim, along with post 42 (specifically, the townread on matias) were the main reasons that my initial instinct was that he's town. I'd still say he's town, but i could very well be wrong. I'm definitely not hammering him. <br>\n<br>\nOn a related note, funny story drmy, me having a townread on someone that you have a scumread on does NOT, in fact, mean that i have \"hidden information\" that makes me scum.

Dannflor and Maestro are bussing each other while Monkey tries to avoid attention.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nAs for what I recommend our course of action is, we lynch either Dannflor or Maestro today (in my mind, Dannflor - he strikes me as scummier than Maestro). His flip gives us more of an idea on drmyshotgun and Maestro. With all of that in mind, we see how things are progressing but either lynch Monkey, or, if it seems more prudent, we lynch Maestro/drmyshotgun (based off of Dannflor's flip). A monkey lynch today is better than most other candidates, but we don't get as much information from his flip than we would from Dannflor. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Vote: Dannflor</div></div></blockquote><br>\nHe unvotes AP.

I'm going to ISO the most scummy people in the game, and maybe a few lurkurs too. First up... Maestro.<br>\n<br>\nHe came in on post 69, simply agreeing with everyone else and generally saying that dr seemed scummy. EXACTLY the same thing as others had been saying. In his next post he copies me and says the exact same thing, voting dr after that. I can't determine to much from that, he didn't really contribute at all and simply repeated other peoples posts. However, it could be simply that he joined in late and hadn't really formed any opinion of his own and started sheeping. Either way, it's kind of scummy.<br>\n<br>\nPost #77 was rather odd, again not contributing and only trying to <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">make</div> dr angry and thus gain more grounds to lynch him. He didn't post anything of importance after that. <br>\n<br>\nIt's hard to judge with so little posts from him, but he's playing rather scummy. Simply trying to draw dr out and pile onto his wagon. I'd say he is leaning scum, I have to wait until he posts more for a definite read.<br>\n<br>\nTaking into account Maestro's scummy behaviour, I think I will re-ISO dr, and see if my vote should change. <br>\n<br>\nIn post #36 dr voted Matias, agreeing with AngryPidgeon. dr doesn't nessecairilly state his reasons for voting Matias, and seems to just want to jump on someones wagon. His next few posts are just shit. They don't even make any sense. First he claims he voted Matias because he thought that Matias posted to much. This is stupid. Then he starts insulting implosion and votes him for no reason. His next couple posts are just more insults and nonsense. And then... more nonsense.

ESPECIALLY if the person being hammered is scum.<br>\n<br>\nAlso Maestro has pretty much not made any case against anyone except drmyshotgun.  He said matias/implosion may be a scum team in 234, but that is the biggest case he has made against anyone other than drmyshotgun.  Then Implosion posts this:<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4157520#p4157520\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4157520#p4157520\" data-post-id=\"4157520\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 348</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=14368\">implosion</a> wrote:</cite>Maestro - scum.

His read justifications are... okay. Meh. Really, there's nothing that I see as a strong tell either way. Parroting really isn't a tell for the reasons that he gave - if someone has an opinion that happens to match someone else's opinion, doesn't mean it's parroting (plus i don't think parroting is particularly scummy in general so).</div></blockquote><br>\nAnd Maestro doesn't even really respond to it at all.

I think...?</div></blockquote><br>\nHe later posts to say that implosion is leaning scum for the same reasons that everyone has been talking about.  Something about this response really bothers me.  Implosion is apparently Maestro's biggest scum read after Drmyshotgun (which he took back), but when Implosion sits on the fence about him, Maestro pretty much ignores his existence.<br>\n<br>\nAt this point, I realize that a lot of my suspicion on Maestro is gut, but I am feeling some subtle differences in his style.<br>\n<br>\n----------------------------------------<br>\n<br>\nSlandaar, I am really curious about your implosion reads.  I kind of see your point about McStab, but I find it hard to believe that scum McStab would force post 85 on us.  Your case against him is pretty compelling though.  It does make me want to see the monkey flip because scum monkey means town McStab, but implosion is the better lynch.<br>\n<br>\nDrmyshotgun has been one of the people pushing an implosion lynch so if/when implosion flips scum, I would put drmy in the obv-town bucket.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nThis catches me up the most, I think.<br>\n<br>\nMaestro scum read reinforced, and implosion looks worse.

This is absolutely false and manufactured. I was one of the first on AngryPidgeon and MonkeyMan. The only person who's wagon I jumped on was Dannflor, because I had been busy rereading while the whole thing went down. I still don't mind lynching Dannflor, but he doesn't appear to be a viable lynch to the rest of the town today. It wouldn't do much good if we didn't compromise and vote for people who we see as second scummiest, or else we'd never make a lynch.<br>\n3. Yes, I was hunting for scum associations. I abandoned it for reasons of compromise as stated above.<br>\n4. Checkout my meta, there isn't a whole lot but I never post often. I post when under suspicion because I don't want falsehoods to spread about me, and it's important to prevent that. This isn't a scummy trait - no one's win condition is satisfied by getting yourself lynched (unless you're playing in a game with a jester). Aside from that, the posts where I vote AP, Dannflor and Monkey aren't made under duress. You're trying to manufacture a self-fulfilling prophecy because I'm sure you'll comeout with a \"see he only posts under suspicion\" from me responding to this.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n@Tech: My view on AP is of a town player. At the time I got into the conflict with him I believed he was plausibly scum, but his behaviour for the last few hundred posts says otherwise.<br>\n<br>\nAlso Slandaar, I suggest you look at some of the other wagons without going off the assumption I'm scum. You haven't been helpful in scumhunting because all of your reads are focused on me being scum and then what that means for other players (e.g. you don't look at Monkey for his own merits, only that I want him lynched).

{"number": 532, "id": "4171347", "user": "implosion", "user_id": "14368", "content": "So maestro's said that he's probably going to declare intent, so i'll just claim: vt. <br>\n<br>\nAnyway, what follows is a bunch of very good advice that nobody is going to listen to after i flip town (if i'm lynched). I'm going to say it anyway. <br>\n<br>\n1) This applies to almost everyone in the game: tunnelvision is a bad thing. I think there's some extent of this with those townies on my wagon, and less so on the monkey wagon, but in short: a lot of people are getting early reads on people, then interpreting everything that they see later from those people in a scummy light. When i say tunnelvision, i don't mean tunneling. I mean the tendency to perceive things that one's scumreads say as scummy because one already has a scumread on them. Don't do it. This advice applies to angrypidgeon and drmyshotgun above all else, but also arugula if he's town, which i'm thinking less and less. <br>\n<br>\n2) The wagon on me <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">is mostly town.</div> I expect there to be 5 town and 1 scum on my wagon, right now (2 is possible, but i'll explain why i think it's unlikely). First of all, kondi/angrybirds are town, and i'm thinking drmy and techno (particularly drmy) are town more as time goes on. That leaves two people on the wagon (mcstab, arugula) who i perceive as potential scums on the wagon, but here's the reason that there probably isn't a lot of scum: compare this wagon and the monkeyman wagon. <br>\n<br>\nMonkey: AngryPidgeon, Arugula, Dannflor, drmyshotgun, McStab, TeChNoWC<br>\nimplosion (and this is in the order that they voted me) techno, kondi, arugula, angrypidgeon, drmyshotgun, mcstab.<br>\n<br>\nNow, compare the two. It's really funny, because 5/6 of the wagon of me is made up of the old monkey wagon. I'm operating under something of an assumption that monkey is town, but if he is (and i strongly think he is the more i think about his claim), then there's really no compelling reason for scum to spontaneously jump from one mislynch that's going swimmingly to a different mislynch. Sure, another claim. But i just don't see a lot of scum doing it. Because of this, I think techno's switch in particular is a very, very strong towntell. Kondi is the only one on me who wasn't on the old wagon, dannflor is the only one on the old wagon who didn't jump on me. More than that, i think scum would be uncomfortable jumping from wagon to wagon shamelessly.<br>\n<br>\nThis point should be disregarded, and perhaps reversed, if monkey flips scum in the future, but i don't see that happening. <br>\n<br>\n3) this goes in with the above, and it's a genuine concern of mine because i really think that if the town doesn't get this under control, it's going to go down in flames: people need to stop joining large wagons simply because they exist. drmy's vote on me is a great example of that. The monkey wagon is a great example of that. I'm not phrasing it well, though, but in short, the way that the town is playing here reminds me strongly of pick your poison 5 (a large theme). The town was ridiculously reckless, and had several mislynches go through that really should have never happened. So i guess what i really mean to say is: think twice. This ties in with the point about tunnelvision as well. I've seen a dynamic like it work before, but i really strongly doubt that it will in a game like this.<br>\n<br>\n4) as the day's gone on, my nullreads have been falling into other categories. Arugula is scum; maestro is town; kondi is town. arugula, dannflor, and mcstab are my top 3 picks for scum right now. andrew should be downgraded to null at this point, just because i feel like he isn't being as active as i expect him to be as town. I'm confident that matias is town, i'm confident that kondi is town, i'm confident that techno is town. Those three are definitely, definitely town, to the point where i have very little paranoia. Slandaar is town, but there's a chance that i just think he's town because he's right on a lot of things in a town where there are way too many people on the wrong track. Angrypidgeon is also town, but if one of my townreads is wrong, it could well be him.<br>\n<br>\nAnd that's pretty much it.", "time": "Sat Jul 07, 2012 2:08 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=22466&start=525", "forum": "53", "thread": "22466"}

I guess in short, you were calling me scum without giving any explanation. You never explained any of what you were doing. I also think that scum would start deciding to switch from the monkey wagon to my wagon at about the point that you did. <br>\n<br>\nMaestro-town is largely gut, i guess.

I think he and Maestro are scum together <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":|\" title=\"Neutral\"><br>\n<br>\nA couple things:  Monkey is town.  Also why the hell are you not on the Maestro wagon since he is the only other person looking like he may get lynched right now?   Oh right, because you are lightly bussing him but don't want to make it obvious or actually vote for him since we may still lynch someone else.<br>\n<br>\nI really don't like this.  I just don't get a town feel at all from the tone of the last few McStab posts.  I think a townie would likely have voted for Maestro since he is the other wagon right now.  McStab even said he thinks Maestro is scum.  If McStab were town then he has every single reason to vote Maestro since Maestro is on pretty much everyone's lynch list and has the most significant amount of votes.  A townie would not be concerned about throwing his vote down on the most likely other wagon, ESPECIALLY if he thinks that player is scummy.  Why does McStab not vote Maestro?  The only thing I can think of is that he and Maestro are scum together and McStab doesn't want to look like he is obviously bussing him if/when Maestro flips scum today.<br>\n<br>\nPost 271 is just scummy.  He presents all possible cases about Dannflor, Maestro, and Monkey being scum together but doesn't really come to any meaningful conclusion from his proposed scenarios.  It really just looks like someone trying to take stance instead of actually genuine reasoning (kinda like 86).  And I love how he calls Maestro scum repeatedly, but never pushes for a vote on him.  It just fits so well.  He lumps his scum buddy into the useless proposed scenarios post along with Dannflor and Monkey and then actively tries to get Monkey/Dannflor lynched.  Now that the opportunity for a Maestro lynch is at hand he doesn't seem interested in getting on the wagon.  It really doesn't add up.<br>\n<br>\nSlandaar I really hope you are right about this, but McStab's posts are only hurting himself so....<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: McStab</span><br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Maestro</span><br>\n<br>\nIf McStab flips town, then I will really need to rethink a lot about what happened.

What you were saying in your simple logic post and what you are saying here doesn't prove anything.  Let me explain.<br>\n1. I am going to assume Dann is town.  Scum has no motivation to claim cop D1 like he did out of nowhere so, Dann is prob-town.<br>\n2. since Dann is town he is likely not lying about being a cop.<br>\n3. Lets assume you are telling the truth about being a role cop because if you aren't then we should PL you regardless of anything else.<br>\n<br>\nNow there are two scenarios: either McStab is a town role-cop or a scum role-cop.<br>\n<br>\nAssume McStab is town role-cop.  Dann's role is very powerful.  This means the mafia would have to have some number of role blockers or Godfather roles to balance the strong cop/rolecop town team.  The assumption that McStab is town could make sense in this case since it doesn't contradict.<br>\n<br>\nNow assume that McStab is scum.  The presence of Dann's full cop role makes it likely that the Mafia has a blocker/rolecop role on board to counter that.  McStab's rolecop role fills that spot.  This also makes sense and the assumption that McStab is scum doesn't contradict itself.<br>\n<br>\nWhat does this all mean?  It means that Dann is town and a cop.  It means that McStab is telling the truth about being a role cop.  It also means that Mcstab could either be town or scum because both scenarios are plausible.  So Dann's claim neither strengthens nor weakens yours.<br>\n<br>\nDrmyshotgun: <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU5LMG3WFBw\" class=\"postlink\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU5LMG3WFBw</a>", "time": "Fri Jul 13, 2012 2:31 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=22466&start=675", "forum": "53", "thread": "22466"}

Me being scum doesn't make sense.  He showed genuine interest in turning my pressure wagon into a lynch wagon in post 39.  Then we both walled up the thread for a long time.  A full blown double bus on Day 1 like that would be impossible.<br>\n<br>\nThese players are conf-town and I will be<div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF00\"> correctly</div> treating them as such in the following analyses.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: normal; display: inline\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF0000\">Drmyshotgun.</div></div>  I wrote out a huge post about why McStab's #85 makes drmy a likely town but kept struggling with my conclusion about it.  I finally had to confess that the opposite is true.  #85 actually makes Drmyshotgun <div style=\"display:inline-flex;text-decoration:line-through\">look really bad</div> confirmed scum.<br>\n<br>\nPreface:  #85 doesn't make much sense when you first look at it.  It looks like McStab is just OMGUSing me and then listing off bullshit tells to make himself look better.  However, there is actually a really deep motivation behind post 85.  McStab is trying to break up the drmyshotgun wagon which had 3 votes on it at the time.  Note that Monkeyman had also talked about putting the 4th vote on drmyshotgun at this point.  McStab is being VERY subtle about wanting to disband dr's wagon, which is why post 85 looks like a lot of bullshit if you don't take the time to think about it carefully.<br>\n<br>\nExhibit A: McStab calls Drmyshotgun scummy while simultaneously casting doubt on the wagon itself.<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>drmyshotgun - <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Null leaning scum</div>. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">To be honest, I haven't gotten the impression that anything drmyshotgun has done is particularly scummy, but rather, that his reactions have been negative for finding scum.</div> Recklessness (a quality he seemingly possesses in abundance) is, in my opinion, generally a more town than scum quality. That being said, his reactions have muddied the waters and his sarcasm is easily misinterpreted; I would prefer it if he instead took a well-reasoned approach to things, as the way he is posting now is directing virtually everyone's attention and causing a mass tunnelling. </div></blockquote><br>\nHe calls Drmyshotgun scummy.  Then he calls him an idiot.  Then he backpedals and says drmyshotgun actually has town-tells.  What is going on here?  McStab listed drmy as null-leaning-scum just in case the drmyshotgun wagon actually takes off.  In the event that the wagon gains popularity, he wants to use that null-scum 'read' to fall back on so he can say he originally felt drmy was scummy when he flips scum.  <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">McStab is casting some doubt on the wagon while simultaneously setting himself up for a fall back when drmy flips scum.</div><br>\n<br>\nHe also directly addresses all <div style=\"display:inline-flex;text-decoration:line-through\">three</div> four people on the drmyshotgun wagon and SUBTLY encourages them to move their votes elsewhere.  There are 3 people on Drmyshotguns wagon at this point:<div style=\"display:inline;color:#0000FF\"> Matias</div>, <div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF00\">Dannflor,</div> and Maestro (in that order).  <div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF00\">Monkey </div>is the 4th because he expressed interest in voting drmyshotgun, but had yet to move his vote from <div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF00\">me</div> to drmyshotgun.<br>\n<br>\nExhibit B: He subtly fear-mongers <div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF00\">Dannflor </div>into leaving the drmyshotgun wagon:<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Dannflor - Null leaning scum. Again, not much to go off of here, <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">but his late joining on the drmyshotgun bandwagon,</div> combined with some hypocritical action \"you seem to want to pile the votes on Matias as quick as possible\"<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"> followed by adding yet another vote to drmyshotgun is flawed logic</div> (but, I acknowledge, not necessarily scummy). I didn't like the post where he hadn't bothered to read page 3 - it smells like a lack of interest in scumhunting. All of this being said, however, the sample size is small, <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">but I would encourage everyone to watch his next few posts and ensure some real scumhunting.</div></div></blockquote><br>\nI especially love that last bolded part.  My, my my, what is McStab doing here?  He calls <div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF00\">Dannflor</div> null-leaning-scum and then goes off to rant about the drmyshotgun wagon and how BEING ON THE WAGON IS WHAT MAKES<div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF00\"> DANN</div> SCUMMY.  This is a pretty huge reaction considering the fact that <div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF00\">Dannflor</div> was only the second voter on the wagon.  He even calls a vote for drmyshotgun \"flawed logic\".  His very last statement is encouraging Dannflor to target people other than drmyshotgun even though McStab is being pretty subtle about it.  <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">The true motivation behind this part of the post is to get Dannflor to stop targeting Drmyshotgun.</div><br>\n<br>\nExhibit C: He pulls the same stunt as above except with Maestro now instead of <div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF00\">Dannflor.</div><br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Maestro - Null. While his reasoning is solid, it has thus far only been used on one issue (the drmyshotgun-matias conflict) and given the amount of mud being slung, <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">I think it'd be easy enough for scum to come up with a easy way onto the drmyshotgun wagon.</div> Only time and more posts will give me a better sense of where Maestro stands.</div></blockquote><br>\nHe calls Maestro null but then implies that the drmyshotgun wagon (which Maestro is on) is scum driven.......!!!!!!!  He has now mentioned that BOTH Dannflor AND Maestro are scummy BECAUSE OF THEIR DRMYSHOTGUN VOTES.  I realize he didn't call Maestro scum directly, but read the bolded statement again.  He is clearly addressing Maestro since this part of the post is his 'read on Maestro' and he once again brings up how scummy the Drmyshotgun wagon is.  He is by association calling Maestro scummy for being on the wagon even if he doesn't outright say \"Maestro is scummy\". <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"> He has now subtly encouraged both Maestro and Dannflor to move their votes by hinting that the drmyshotgun wagon is scummy.</div><br>\n<br>\nExhibit D: McStab is actually suggesting a counterwagon in his #85 post that will look enticing to MonkeyMan.<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I'm considering getting on the drmy wagon but it's hard cause I like the AP wagon just as much.</div></blockquote><br>\nMonkeyMan said that only a few posts before McStab's #85.  Who is McStab clearly counter-wagoning in 85? <div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF00\">Me</div>.  Why me?  A large part of him choosing me is because I am the only person that <div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF00\">Monkey</div> is willing to vote for other than drmyshotgun.  <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">McStab is trying to make my wagon take-off so that <div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF00\">Monkeyman</div> has no reason to move over to drmyshotgun's wagon.</div><br>\n<br>\nExhibit E: There is only one person on the drmyshotgun wagon that McStab hasn't fear mongered into moving votes yet: <div style=\"display:inline;color:#0000FF\">Matias.</div>  Note that McStab only made one hard town read on anbody and that person was the 3rd person on the drmyshotgun wagon:<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Matias - Town. Whereas some see fence-sitting, I instead see someone who's avoiding tunnelling and applying pressure to see how people react, and I think his aggressive, confrontational demeanor, combined with organization and well-reasoned arguments, is a clear town indicator.</div></blockquote><br>\nMcStab has already subtly (and separately) encouraged <div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF00\">Dannflor</div> and Maestro to move votes.  It would look pretty suspect if he did that a 3rd time with<div style=\"display:inline;color:#0000FF\"> Matias</div>, so what does he do?  He buddies Matias.  He is quite clearly trying to buddy Matias in an attempt to get Matias to consider McStab's own 'scum-targets': <div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF00\">me and Dannflor.</div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"font-size: 200%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">This all makes too much sense.  Read Post 85 and look for the following things:<br>\n1. Calls drmyshotgun a scum read but then implies the wagon isn't a good idea.<br>\n2. Encourages Dannflor and Maestro to get off the drmyshotgun wagon by calling their votes on it scummy.<br>\n3. Counter wagons me.<br>\n4. Encourages MonkeyMan to not switch his vote to drmyshotgun by wagoning me.<br>\n5. Encourages Matias to swap to his counter-wagon on me by buddying Matias.  Matias had voted me previously AND I was FOSing Matias so it is a fairly safe assumption on McStab's part that Matias would vote for me again.</div><br>\n<br>\nAlso, Drmydhotgun knows that Dannflor has suspected him all game day and is trying to use Kondi as cop-bait:<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I say we all look into Kondi during the night.<br>\nHe's been buying so much time on this and without good reason.</div></blockquote><br>\nDrmyshotgun didn't really say anything about Kondi being scummy before this.  He pressured Kondi considerably less than other players.  Why is he saying to investigate Kondi here?  What is the only reason Kondi is scummy?  Oh, right, because McStab flipped scum and Kondi was fervently defending him from Slandaar.  If McStab flipped town, would Kondi still be scummy?  No, not really.  The McStab scum flip is what makes him look really bad.  Why is Drmyshotgun calling for Kondi to be investigated before the flip?  Answer:  because drmyshotgun knew McStab would flip scum, thus making Kondi look bad.  Why is scum drmyshotgun trying to steer Dannflor's role without making it obvious?  Because Dannflor had drmyshotgun on his suspicions list and would be very likely to target drmyshotgun.  Drmyshotgun doesn't want Dannflor to get a guilty read on him and is using Kondi as role bait.<br>\n<br>\nAlso Drmyshotgun is scum for this glorious setup lynch:<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>If Monkey flips Town, it's your neck goes next Implosion</div></blockquote> <br>\nDrmyshotgun knows monkey will flip town and is trying to set up a double mislynch here.  Not to sheep Slandaar, but Slandaar is definitely correct.  Drmyshotgun's ringleading on the monkey wagon was super bonus scummy.  Seriously read his iso from iso#33.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"font-size: 200%; line-height: normal; display: inline\"><br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF0000\">TL:DR? McStab blatantly bussed drmyshotgun then attempted to disband his wagon in 5 different ways (calling Maestro scum for being on it, calling Dannflor scum for being on it, Calling drmyshotgun a newb-town, encouraging Monkey to keep his vote on me, and Buddying the 3rd and final person on the wagon: Matias.)</div></div><br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline-flex;text-decoration:line-through\">Assuming</div>Knowing that drmyshotgun and McStab are scum clears these players:<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#0000FF\">Matias</div> - McStab was clearly trying to steer his vote in #85.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#0000FF\">Maestro</div> - McStab was clearly trying to steer his vote in #85.  Also, why would drmyshotgun and Maestro double bus on D1?<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#0000FF\">Kondi </div>- Because scum drmyshotgun is openly encouraging that he be investigated in post 704.  Cop Dannflor would likely target drmyshotgun tonight since Dannflor had him on his scum list.  Drmyshotgun is afraid of this and is attempting to get Kondi investigated.  This is a good strategy for scum drmyshotgun because Kondi is easy cop-bait due to his scummy bullshit about McStab.<br>\n<br>\nIf I take conf-scum Drmy and all the conf-town/prob-towns out of the player list, then the last scum is in this list:<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF8000\">Techno, Arugula, implosion, andrew.</div><br>\n<br>\nOne of these four is the last scum.  I am leaning towards Techno.  ISO him.  Actually dont.  Just <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: drmyshotgun</span> and we can vaporize these scummy players tomorrow.  But seriously........I think its techno.  I will ISO these players extensively after the drmyshotgun scum-flip, but Techno's ISO is giving me the worlds biggest gut scum-read, knowing what I know about drmyshotgun and McStab.<br>\n<br>\n3rd scum likelihoods:<br>\nI don't actually think its Andrew or Implosion at all given their interactions with drmyshotgun.<br>\n85% Techno<br>\n15% Arugula<br>\n<br>\nAs a final thing to convince you to vote drmyshotgun, look at Techno, drmyshotgun, and McStab's interactions with each other.  Its super scummy and makes a lot of sense if you read all their references to each other.<br>\n<br>\nTechno is scum because he was super reluctant to join the McStab bandwagon until it was pretty much confirmed.  He even tried to break it up in post 621.  He then kept presenting all this bullshit about just investigating McStab and leaving him alive.  Note that McStab is a mafia role blocker.  Scum Techno knows that if we go with this plan, McStab can just RB Dannflor and then the town won't actually get the information.  Read posts in his iso iso#38 and on.  My Scumdar broke from off the chart measurements.<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>We could simply have dann investigate McStab tonight.<br>\n<br>\nDiscuss.</div></blockquote><br>\nOh, also notice how he is trying to draw suspicion off of McStab in post 449.  He is saying that the only scummy thing Mcstab has done is not give a follow up on me.  This is actually far from scummy, and Techno is intentionally trying to distract from all the scummy things about McStab and just focus on this one not-scummy thing that McStab can easily respond to.<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>McStab's vote on Monkey came out of left field, but considering how scummy Monkey has been acting I don't see much of a problem with it.<br>\nHowever, what I do have a problem with is the way he hasn't followed up on AP.<br>\n<br>\nMcStab, what is your read on AP now?

For that reason I find it likely that the people on monkey/implosion are likely scum:<br>\nimplosion(6): TeChNoWC, kondi2424, Arugula, AngryPidgeon, drmyshotgun, Mcstab<br>\nMonkeyMan576(6): Mcstab,TeChNoWC, AngryPidgeon, drmyshotgun, Arugula, Dannflor<br>\nI would be most ok with Techno, Drmyshotgun, or Arugula today.<br>\n<br>\nI want to come up with some possible relationships to help narrow this down:<br>\n<br>\nArugula and Techno are unlikely to be scum together.<br>\nArugula and Phillammon(Matias) are unlikely to be scum together.<br>\nKondi and drmyshotgun are unlikely to be scum together (although Kondi being godfather makes this more plausible).<br>\n<br>\nHonestly, I still think Techno and drmyshotgun are the best choices.  I will give drmyshotgun a little benefit because of his crumb.  If we don't lynch drmy tonight then I propose he and Dannflor target each other tonight.  If drmy is a townie, then he will protect Dannflor for at least that night and we can get a read back.  If drmy is not a townie then either we get a guilty read back or Dannflor dies which means Drmyshotgun goes next.<br>\n<br>\nTechno is the number one answer for today.

{"number": 964, "id": "4211988", "user": "pidgey", "user_id": "17243", "content": "Ok so im rereading with my power of knowing Mc was scum and maestro was town.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nMatias/phil- His 23 SOUNDS forced, i didnt like how easily his stance changed and especially how he still left some room for later suspicion with the \"if it really is gut\". Also the amount of time he uses \"force\" and \"strange\" on something that was RVS is scummy. Then he overexplains himself to my previous slot. Making connections on RVS stuff is more stupid than scummy though. As of page 4, his play is much better actually. Not as scummy. Yeah as of page 6 i think matias is actually town.  Now he just dissapeared of the game for the last 10 pages ive read and is being useless.<br>\n<br>\nMcstab- first post on angry pigeon is saying he is scummy, not liking mcstab who turned out to be scum. This DOES kinda make AP very much townie. A little defense on Matias. <br>\nDOHOHO A GIANT WALL OF READS ON 85 lets see. NOTES:<br>\n-Ok shotgun is confirmed town. <br>\n-Aragula is null in the list, yet he finds Null that he is pushing on AP, which he himself is voting? Dunno if just saving face in case aragula flips scum. <br>\n-I think that one of the null-leaning town might just be scum. If i had to bet it might be Slaandar. <br>\n-Calls matias town, who im kinda having a scum read as of now.<br>\n<br>\nAngryPigeon my brother from another mother- Town.......... Umm... I wrote town before starting reading and SURE HE WENT FOR MCSTAB, but then he backed away from him gloriously for quite a while. Well, i didnt like the way he jumped out of Mcstab after NOTHING that changed his mind about mcstab to both techno and Matias. He's still town because the analize on monkey he did on 200 is pretty much what i was thinking while rereading that guy. On 259  he listed mc as town because of their back and forth.... <br>\n(INTERMISSION: I get people changing reads and people being right and then chaning their mind to be wrong, but the thing that bothers me the most is the way that pigeon called himself confirmed town in D2 when he himself was changing reads D1. So pigeon, you went against 4 people as far as page 9: Mc, techno, matias, and monkey. You say you are confirmed town because one of them turned out to be scum? really? I mean you are not the lynch today but as of page 9 and with Mc scum you arent confirmed town at all)...<br>\nYou changed again to implosion in 279! And then monkey and then implosion... 464 sounds like you are trying to set up lynches actually. And now you are trying to lynch Maestro in 563, and yes this does look like if you were trying to <br>\n<br>\nMonkeyman/thor- His first reads on the game are Matias and Slaandar town, and AP and drmy scum. Not liking at all that 42 post. 74 is just horrible, he is already setting up misslynches. 90 I dont like either, why would someone who has votes scum for voting for someone with votes already? Why would starting an all new wagon the only townish thing to do? 92.. yeah, sorry you probably replaced into scum, monkey. 111 is again him saying how he isnt saying Mc might not be town but he looks town right now??? And 164 is again a load of crap. Look at his line about McStab and tell me if theres ANYTHING in it. Not only does this player sucks but he is also scum.  205 \"I really see no case here\". 328... and i dont think theres a lot of towntelling in his back and forth with shotgun. Im still reading and so many players wanted to lynch this guy that i dont even know if he just played that bad of a game and he really is town.  AND mcstab started the wagon that made him claim so I dunno but i DO think that mcstab might be bussing especially after 349. Ehhhhh.... should not be lynched because kondi, Mcstab, and others are going for his blood in D1. It could be a bus, but it could not be either. <br>\nFor having him in a \"almost confirmed town\" tier, you sure were convinced very easily on Mcstab scum.<br>\n<br>\nImplosion- Kinda goes out of the way to say that Matias is town IMO. The reason he calls Matias town in 45 is something id call someone scum for. Probably just different POV. Although the 256 list is very damn lazy and non commitive.  The defense against the pressure he got from techno and pigeon was ok, i liked it and it felt townish. I think he sounds kinda sincere in 370 too. This guy is basically town as of 389. <br>\n<br>\nShotgun- Claimed doc. Didnt really liked the way he reacted to implosion vote and other stuff, but he is dead soon if we have a cop. I havent been putting much attention to shotgun but i dont like that he did believe Mc very easily. Anyway, whatever, he is dead sooner or later. <br>\n<br>\ntechno- votes for matias which i would have probably done. Im not liking his 97 because he says that both players did a scummy thing but then says its town on town. Not liked how he jumped on dann at 109, same for matias.  His point about monkey iin 165 is just too great to be scum though. The pressure on 449 is pretty good and im leaning town. The 457 though is pretty bad. Asking questions, trying to divert the attenti0on from mcstab again, etc. As the game has progressed, ive liked his play less and less. Especially disliked how he said that Mc could prove he was a rolecop in 631, seems he was testing waters (if he's scum).<br>\n<br>\ndannflor- play is scummy but he is a cop, but stuff like his first post is why he was probably lynch candidate. <br>\n<br>\nmaestro- o he died, o o he died. <br>\n<br>\nkondi- initial analizis on mc is obviously wrong but the thing is if its a genuine mistake or if he is scum. I like the point he brings about slaandar in 421. Ive honestly never seen kondi put that much effort into a game AND i have never played with scum kondi either... kondi can you link me to some scum games? Its impressive that I actually agree in a lot of his points in that post (monkey), although i heavily disagree with some  (implosion). Im not sure if Kondi is giving town cred to AP just because he stopped on Mcstab, and the way he says theres town in Mcstab's 354 is not really great. 432 is kinda horriugly. Not liking his jump to implosion either. If kondi is town the way he is defending mcstab was just ridiculous, because he is now trying to lynch maestro over him. Yeah 653 makes him scum. <br>\n<br>\nslaandar- he is kinda playing under the radar first pages. 214 makes me think of a monkey/mc/slaandar team actually. He is basically kinda under the radar really, and me no like. Actually, slaandar popped in on page 15 and the back and forth with kondi is pretty townish. LOL slaandar is town for 446 plain and simple AND MUCH MORE TOWN THAT PIGEON TOO. <br>\n<br>\naragula- I like his initial vote on Matias because if i had been playing the game i might have done the same thing. Initially before starting rereading i thought aragula would be a good read cause he wanted to lynch me all the time. list of reads at 116... they are mostly pretty bad reads (which i now know with hindsight) but he is probably a vig so whatever for now. I will say that <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">WHY DID YOU KILLED MAESTRO</div>, if you had a town read on him? 243 makes me think that aragula might be a serial killer. What are the possibilities of that?  Aragula, why didnt you kill implosion or monkeyman, who you shouted all day that you thought were scum? Plus you have no problem sheeping ANY kind of case that pops up in the thread. Youve done it at least like 3 times before page 22. And you did it again with Mcstab. <br>\n<br>\nandrew- god my slot was very dumb and whats up with not using sentences coherently. <br>\n<br>\nSCUM<br>\nTechno<br>\nKondi<br>\nAngry Pigeon/MatiasNowPhil/Monkey<br>\n<br>\n(And id go for AP, then matias, and last monkey, after kondi and techno.

Which is the only reason I even defended myself at all.  I want to show who it has to be based on who we can clear.  I don't think it can be Thor based on his interactions with McStab and Techno  (When the slot was Monkey), but he is less confirmed.   Its not Slandaar since he owned the McStab wagon from the ground up.  Its not Arugula because his claim checks out.  Its definitely not Dannflor either since a scum wouldn't claim cop out of nowhere D1.  That leaves the following possible players.<br>\n<br>\nMe<br>\nYou<br>\nImplosion<br>\nThor<br>\n<br>\nI know its not me.  I don't think its Thor because McStab and Techno super bussed him then for no good reason (see the case in my previous posts).  I realize this is less than 1005 confirmed, hence why he is in the maybe pile.  I also find Monkey's play to look very town.  That leaves you and implosion.  Dann cleared you.  I've been suspecting a GF in the game because doc + cop + 2xVig VS an rb seems op.  As slandaar pointed out, its likely McStab claimed RC for a reason, so that lost mafia PR is likely that.  So I'll give you the benefit of the doubt on the clear despite Andrew being stupid D1 and asking to be copped.  That leaves implosion. The only defense that can be made for implosion is that he is somewhat responsible for the McStab wagon.  But he only did it when at L - 1.  Scum implosion doesn't have much to lose from making that play.  There really isn't anything out there that can clear implosion.  I think its him.<br>\n<br>\nI wish I could give you a better proof of my VTness, but I guess I can't.  I'm pretty convinced its implosion by PoE.  If it isn't him, then its either you (requiring that you be a GF)  or Thor (requiring that McStab and Techno both bussed him out of nowhere for some reason on D1).<br>\n<br>\nAlso, what did you mean by Thor being in lylo?", "time": "Fri Aug 03, 2012 4:47 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=22466&start=1225", "forum": "53", "thread": "22466"}

Even though it was rather quick I'm inclined to think that it was an effort to ratchet up pressure, although I think Matias may be correct in saying that Slandaar's seemed suspicious. Not that the act itself is, but it seems to me a very plausible scum move to try and get people after each other over the wagon, and try to set himself up as a \"town leader\" who is above reproach.<br>\n<br>\nAngryPidgeon's reaction and vote just screams of over-defensiveness, as if he'd read Matias' comments in proper context he'd realize Matias wasn't attacking him, but his justification for voting Matias is \"Looking for an easy Day One Mislynch?\"<br>\n<br>\nAny other reasons, Pidgeon, why you think Matias is scum? If there is, I haven't seen it.</div></blockquote><br>\nThis, along with other posts from mcstab, are why angrypidgeon is confidently town. I just don't see this as an early bout of distancing. <br>\n<br>\nMcStab and techno both make some interesting early references to slandaar. The above post is one. Here's another:<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>techno wrote:</cite>The wagon on pidgeon was pure RVS until Slandaar's serious vote. And he was pushing for a wagon. So how does that not making him 'leading?'<br>\n<br>\nSlandaar doesn't seem to be playing too differently here than what I know of him as scum, but town meta would be helpful. Also it's pretty fuckin early so, idk.</div></blockquote><br>\nTech's waffling. He doesn't seem to want to give a solid read on slandaar. <br>\n<br>\nAnd meh. I'm getting bored with this because there isn't much else of interest at least for a while... so let's look at some votecounts. <br>\n<br>\nVoteCount 1.4<br>\nMonkeyMan576 (6) - AngryPidgeon, Arugula, Dannflor, drmyshotgun, McStab, TeChNoWC<br>\nDannflor (2) - andrew94, implosion<br>\nMaestro (2) - Matias, Slandaar<br>\ndrmyshotgun (1) - MonkeyMan576<br>\n<br>\nNot Voting (2) - Maestro, My Milked Eek<br>\nThis just makes me think monkey[thor] is town. Read: they'd have had to double-bus. read: they'd also have had to double bus on me. Notably, techno was the first vote on my wagon; McStab was the fifth (i.e., the L-1 vote). Angrypidgeon (and arugula but i consider him clear) are the only living people who were on my wagon; this is another reason to believe angrypidgeon is town, unless all 3 scum were voting me, which i don't see a reason to do at that point. Now, the first two people to jump off my wagon were arugula and kondi; that is, tech and mcstab were still on it as it was disintegrating. WE REPORT, YOU DECIDE. <br>\n<br>\nAt this point, in my mind, the last scum is most likely either pidgey or slandaar. I'm not considering the innocent on pidgey at all, because like i said, if he is scum, he's probably a godfather, and i had that idea before the claimed report. So, etc. I <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">could</div> theoretically be swayed towards thor-scum. As far as i'm concerned, if angrypidgeon is scum, he's going to win and there's nothing we can do. But reading slandaar and pidgey in isolation is leading me to meh results. I like both of their play (of course, i don't like andrew's play, but yeah, pidgey redeemed the slot to an extent).", "time": "Thu Aug 09, 2012 6:53 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=22466&start=1250", "forum": "53", "thread": "22466"}

So far I haven't been able to find any gaping holes in that strategy.  It seems that he has himself covered pretty well.  The only thing I can think that could have gone wrong for him would be if we off'd the 2nd and final scum D2 which means that only one kill would go through (on Kondi) and then he would be screwed because we would lynch Drmyshotgun D3 and then realize that Arugula was lying.  So the only possible flaw with Aru's claim is the chance we off the last scum D2.  Which makes me wonder what he thought about Kondi and Techno at that time.<br>\n<br>\nP-edit: Thor is town.

There is no way the mafia would target a self-gimped SK when they have a dr/cop conf-town combo to worry about first.  By claiming 2shot Vig on D2, he is guaranteed the ability to use his 2nd shot that night, regardless of whether or not mafia kill him.  And then he won't be able to use it again until mafia are dead, or he will 100% expose himself to the town.  On N2 you could kill him, but he still gets that shot anyways.  And in the meantime Drmy/Dann are clearing people which is a huge disadvantage to scum.  So Arugula and the mafia would both know that the mafia are forced to kill Drmy on N2 and Dann on N3.  Arugula then gets to D4 for free regardless and there are 3 chances (1 shot, 2 lynches) to off the last mafia in that time.  And given the state of the game, it was fairly likely that the last mafia would die in that time.  That means The mafia would very likely never have a chance to get around to killing him.

This game is frying my brain.<br>\n<br>\nThe main thing that made me get off the Arugula case was the setup speculation.<br>\n<br>\nI don't think 1/2/10 with Goon/RB and Cop/Doc is balanced.  It looks like its very town-sided.  In Mini 1351 there was 2 less VTs and a reporter/Joat instead of Cop/Doc.  Which, if balanced, means that this game is incredibly town sided in the 1:2:10 scenario.  I guess 1:3:9 is possible, but that seems very scum sided and would mean we have 2 scum left (Aru + one other).<br>\n<br>\nThor: Part of Arugula claiming 2 shot vig means as an SK means that he would necessarily need to know how many mafia there are in the game to pull off the claim.  Assume it could be 1:3:9 or 1:2:10 (you have said it could be either).  Arugula does not know which it is.  Assume at the end of D2 he uses his last shot to kill Techno and Techno kills Drmyshotgun.  Now Arugula's N3 play needs to be based on whether or not he thinks there are 2 scum or 3 scum in the game.  If he kills someone N3 and the 3rd mafia member does as well then the town would realize that Arugula was lying since 2 people died and he had claimed to be out of shots.  Although this isn't horribly compelling on N3 since Arugula and the potential 3rd mafia member would be both targeting Dannflor anyways which makes only one kill.  I dunno.  I had been assuming that 1:3:9 was impossible and that a fake claim from Arugula would be a pretty easy mask to hide behind.  The possible presence of a 3rd scum would make his claim much harder to pull off.<br>\n<br>\nLet me lay out the Arugula posts for my own benefit:<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"font-size: 200%; line-height: normal; display: inline\">D2</div></div><br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4205527#p4205527\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=4205527#p4205527\" data-post-id=\"4205527\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 816</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=18554\">Arugula</a> wrote:</cite>I'm a 2-shot vig.<br>\n<br>\nI shot Maestro N1 and <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">I asked the mod if it went through but he can't tell me until postgame.</div></div></blockquote><br>\nBolded is confusing.

Note:  I just read through and confirmed that the game was in twilight at this point.  Kondi was dead and Arugula was bound on shooting Tech.

Why is me accusing Slandaar any different than my behavior the past Day?  Its not.  So why did it cause Slandaar's opinion of me to 180 seeing as how it was incredibly consistent with everything IVe been doing?

Now hes flipped his opinion about me which looks bad so that on D5 he can say \"Oh, well, I realize what I did looks so scummy but I was SURE it was Pidgeon.

Then his claim secured his death.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nI realize this is going to contradict what I said previously but here goes:<br>\n<br>\nI legitimately wanted a McStab lynch at that point of the game (when I was wall v walling him).  The reason I unvoted and moved on was because I was not getting any support and was beginning to wonder if my inexperience was causing me to see things that weren't there.  When asked about it, I said I was reaction testing etc, which was only partially true.  I ended up listing McStab as town after my reevaluation (I honestly reread the Me/Stab ISO at least 3 times back then).  The huge lack of support I was getting from other players with respect to my McStab case gave me a creeping suspicion that I was just being an idiot.  Particularly, Arugula's comment about me being lucky that McStab's 85 sounded so scummy made me stop and wonder if I was just making something from nothing (and decided I probably was).  I've since gained a lot more confidence in my reads.  Also Techno and Matias's comments about Me and Stab looking town V town contributed to my rethink.  Side note: on the topic of hindsight, Matias couldn't possibly be scum for saying the same thing that Techno had about me and Sab being Town v Town.  There is no way both of Stab's buddies would swoop in and say that back to back.  20/20, etc.<br>\n<br>\nSo I kind of ignored McStab after that point for awhile (partly because he disappeared and partly because I was then very focused on Matias/Monkey/implosion).  By the time he resurfaced I was pretty tunnel-visioned on these other players.<br>\n<br>\nYes I did switch my vote from Maestro -&gt; McStab after implosion/Slandaar booted up his wagon primarily because Stab's posts to defend himself form implosion were obvious BS.  The \"you guys don't want to make me claim\" bit was absurdly scummy.  That was also when I began suspecting Techno because Techno's \"We can't run up anymore players, claims = bad\" was absurdly scum sounding.", "time": "Wed Aug 15, 2012 9:45 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=22466&start=1600", "forum": "53", "thread": "22466"}

Monkey slipped a town-tell really hard IMO, but the wagon on him doesn't actually clear him in hindsight.  McStab/Tech were the first on the wagon and then Techno started the counterwagon to Monkey (on you lol) after Monkey had been at L - 1 for a while and Maestro had claimed intent to hammer.  I'm not sure why Stab/Techno didn't just accept the monkey lynch that Maestro was about to deliver...If he is town, then why not?  It makes Arugula look bad.  It makes me look bad.  Maestro was already looking bad and that wouldn't have helped his townieness at all.  I was pretty certain of Thor's townieness but now I'm second guessing myself yet again.<br>\n<br>\nI swear I've got this absurd paranoia where as soon as I think someone is conf-town this little voice in my head says \"But what if they aren't?  Everything is WIFOM, they could just be playing around that, right?\"<br>\n<br>\nThe implosion wagon...seems like the most legitimate clear from D1, honestly.  Stab/Techno were both on it and seemed fairly committed to it (unlike the Monkey wagon that was both created and dissolved by Techno/Stab).  I need to ISO Techno's posts around the implosion L - 1 time frame.  His list of reads from then could be important.<br>\n<br>\nPidgey/Arugula are my best town reads for the time being.  I really do like implosion's appeal to game design case for hard clearing Arugula.  Thor / Implosion / Slandaar = All involved in some form of bussing if they are scum.<br>\n<br>\nHere is actually the part about Slandaar giving me the worst gut feeling right now:  his L - 1 Arugula vote...Seriously, Slandaar played a conservative D1.  By that I mean he never really jumped onto popular/fast wagons or brought anyone super close to a lynch with his vote.  He put the first vote on Dann and Maestro I believe and then ended up being vote #1 on Stab.  He never really sheeped or wagoned anyone up.  The fact he would throw someone to L - 1 the phase before MyLo without any hard thought on the matter just seems off.  It really seems like he was hoping Pidgey would swoop in and derp hammer (not saying pidgey doing that is likely, but still wtf?).  Is no one else finding that play odd?<br>\n<br>\n@Slandaar: If you are going to accuse me of lying please point out specifics and I will explain why you are wrong.  The ONLY thing I said that was not completely true was in post 160.  Which I already explained.<br>\n<br>\nAlso, LOL. way to selectively quote me in post 602.

That is a heuristic and I don't see any reason for believing it.

Two things.<br>\n<br>\n1.  I originally felt you were a very prideful player and wouldn't make a sigbet you had inside info on because that would be slightly dishonest.  Your response showed me that you ARE capable of throwing the bet for some town cred since you see no problem with doing the opposite.  So my reason for thinking you are conf-town for that is wrong.<br>\n<br>\n2.  You are saying you are town and therefore have no information and therefore entered the bet with no motivation other to stroke your ego on the flip prediction.

Why then did he drop my name at this spot?  On a deep subconscious level, Monkey believes Drmy and I are a scum team and he is operating under that assumption in his post here.

The reason I unvoted and moved on was because I was not getting any support and was beginning to wonder if my inexperience was causing me to see things that weren't there.  When asked about it, I said I was reaction testing etc, which was only partially true.  I ended up listing McStab as town after my reevaluation (I honestly reread the Me/Stab ISO at least 3 times back then).  The huge lack of support I was getting from other players with respect to my McStab case gave me a creeping suspicion that I was just being an idiot.  Particularly, Arugula's comment about me being lucky that McStab's 85 sounded so scummy made me stop and wonder if I was just making something from nothing (and decided I probably was).  I've since gained a lot more confidence in my reads.  Also Techno and Matias's comments about Me and Stab looking town V town contributed to my rethink.  Side note: on the topic of hindsight, Matias couldn't possibly be scum for saying the same thing that Techno had about me and Sab being Town v Town.  There is no way both of Stab's buddies would swoop in and say that back to back.  20/20, etc.<br>\n<br>\nSo I kind of ignored McStab after that point for awhile (partly because he disappeared and partly because I was then very focused on Matias/Monkey/implosion).  By the time he resurfaced I was pretty tunnel-visioned on these other players.<br>\n<br>\nYes I did switch my vote from Maestro -&gt; McStab after implosion/Slandaar booted up his wagon primarily because Stab's posts to defend himself form implosion were obvious BS.

I still think scum could write that post, but it definitely at least SEEMS to come from town motivation, ie implosion is contributing more and has possible towntells whereas I don't feel anything indicates Monkey is town. The townslip AP mentioned is not that telling. Bad scum tunnel too. It depends on the player's playstyle and *sigh* comes down to more meta analysis.<br>\n<br>\nAndrew has few scumtells but even less towntells.

Simply could be a 'prey on the weak' scum mentality though.<br>\n<br>\nI will NOT be happy lynching the following: AP, Arugula, Kondi, McStab, Slandaar, drmyshotgun and dannflor (not so sure about Matias at this stage, eg stop flaking and post MOAR). Maestro I wouldn't be so cut up about seeing go. Only thing I don't like about the Maestro wagon is that if we keep creating multiple bandwagons up to L-1, we are going to just create a claim fiesta. If we run up one more person (eg say Maestro), THAT'S IT. No more run ups.

I firmly believe drmy and Monkey are not scum together (their earlier interaction would be very fucking odd if a bus). These are the obvi not-possible connections for me. Also think Kondi/McStab and Kondi/dannflor would be unlikely scumteams given his extreme defense of them (less so for dann seeing as a lot of people have defended him similarly), but this is pushing WIFOM.<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"> Unvote<br>\nVote: Monkey </div></div></blockquote>", "time": "Mon Sep 10, 2012 6:02 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=22466&start=1975", "forum": "53", "thread": "22466"}

In fact I think hes more cleared since Stab and Tech wagoned him super hard.  And if hes scum then he decided to label the monkey slot as town for who knows why.  Pidgey is cop cleared which makes it less likely to be him.  Also, I really just don;t see it being him.  Slandaar says acting this way (swearing specifically) is part of his scum meta, but I just can't see Pidgey scum from his posts.  My reasons for thinking hes suspicious pretty much begin with Andrew and end with Pidgey saying shit like \"Im willing to go 1 on 1 with AP\" and \"It would be funny if we are pidgeons on the same team!\"  That was a super big paraphrase and Im not going to dig up the quote.  But the tl;dr of my thoughts on Pidgey is that he is playing emotionally and I take that to be mostly a town tell from him.  There are some scummy things about him, but the rest and the cop clear out weigh that.<br>\n<br>\nThen there is Slandaar.  I have several things I dislike about Slandaar that I brought up D4.  The Stab push seems to good to be scummy though.  Like really he crippled his team and made himself suspicious in LyLo if he is actually scum.<br>\n<br>\nThat leaves Thor.  Tech/Stab wagoned Monkey up just to tear it down.  I saw one big town tell from Monkey but I could have misinterpreted that.  Monkey scum fits with the big picture more than anything.  The only thing that makes me edgy about that is Techno putting you in the pool of targets to Seer.  Really though, there was not much suspicion of you going around D2 so I think its fairly likely Techno could have reasonably expected you not to be targeted anyways.", "time": "Wed Sep 12, 2012 10:50 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=22466&start=2025", "forum": "53", "thread": "22466"}

Ive changed my read so what? And the stuff tou quoted about slaandar and techno was shit i was typing as i read.<br>\n<br>\nSlaandar case is a piece of shit again, he is posting shit about a lylo that i had pretty much had nothing to do, read the fuking game, i fakeclaimed incoherenlty, i said a sensor was lying, and fucking shit like that. Go and look at any other game of mine, i drunk post and i cuss a lot, in fact ive tried to stop that but it happens here and there.<br>\n<br>\nMy head is boiling this week, its been so stressful and glancing at this game just made it worse. <br>\n<br>\nPlease, implosion and AP, if you have any fucking doubts about me i beg you to lynch me. I really hate this, seriously, 100%. Lynch the fucking inno, i dont give a flying shit. Just before we go to the last day. If you will have doubts about me tomorrow if we lynch thor/implo/Ap/slandaar just kill me right now. <br>\n<br>\nYes andrew was fuxking dumb, i said it once and ive said other things but he was dumb, and sincere too because as dumb as he was he wanted to make a case on the cop.<br>\n<br>\n I will still defend that this shit is fucking incredibly stupid, and yes slaandar was much more town than you d1 AP so what i had a scum read on you before what is the fucking meaning of quoting it. And yes fucking kondi turned out to town and i thought he could be town after we hammered him because our fucking mod was away for 1 fucking week and kondi was still being helpful.<br>\n<br>\nLynch me seriously, my only wish is that thor isnt lylo lynch, i dont think scum techno would go and vote him beginning of d2 if he was scum. I have not read why techno unvoted him but still. Slaandar might be but its fucking hard for him to be, if i had to choose it might be implo but hurrr his l-1 post was pretty town sounding.<br>\n<br>\nSlaandar, hopefully if you are town you will realize when the game is done/when i flip that fucking meta is not that important (also your meta read on me is lol so fucking bad and you blind yourself to read whatever the fuck you want to read).<br>\n<br>\nIm still not voting because i do still want to reread d2 but yeah, if you guys drink a cup of coffee and discuss your fucking shit and still want to lynch me, please just do it today. If you think this is my lol gambit, then lynch me today. You find me a hard to read guy, lynch me today. You think im a godfather, please eat some more serup speculation pie and fucking lynch me.

Go back and note when you called my obv. town (also the no lynch day if I recall) I made a joke about how later you'd call me obv. scum (and was right) at even that stage of the game I'd started to realize that though you'd had some really awesome reads earlier (note when I first replaced in I was buddying you like a champ) but I withdrew on that and moved you into mislynch potential as the days progressed because I came to be of the opinion that you didn't need to be buddied because I didn't think you could lead a lynch nor that being 'right' about you was worth much town cred strategically.
