My meta is in my wiki and I can link to more recent ones but I played 40+ games on site and on IRC, and Skype with the crew here. Also for the cop I'd attempt to lynch with a case and strongly hint/bread crumb my result. However, depending on the feel of the town, and if I feel that we're on the wrong track/or I just feel that it's the most advantageous to claim rightout (say we're down a few mislynches, or I totally disagree with the current wagons, etc) then I will claim. It depends on the feel and I adapt to the situation. I'd claim/not claim when it's most advantageous. <br><br>Problems though with this post: I'd don't mind but these two questions are smokescreen questions especially since it's about meta. I'm not impressed by the fact that you didn't ask people for references to their games. Nor am I impressed that you chose to withhold your viewpoints until after you can read everyones. These questions don't launch people into discussion on the players, they focus on theory talk that distracts us from actual scum hunting/game play. That belongs to MD. So I'm not impressed by your fancy questions since I see no purpose in how you can use the information to read the players when you can't verify the player's self meta via links. My bullet will be reserved for you tomorrow."}

Sorry I should clarify. It doesn't out the setup if a miller claims. However a miller claim day 1 makes me keep an eye on the person but if I get a town read I'm more likely to don't recant on it.

There's no advantage to claiming it past that since the element of WIFOM increases significantly. I'd rather have the time to deal with it now then later.<br><br>ALso as a note, I find myself agreeing with Nikanor about Bub since I was about to ask him the same question. I find it odd that Bub singled out Lowell the first vote on the supposed \"Smear wagon\" out of all the votes that he can't hold an alignment read on. It registers on my radar since it's kind of an odd attack. But I can't tell if it's due to the start game (since we have little to start with of course) or is this just someone grasping for straws. And even if it's the latter the lack of info allows the grasping for straws to be validated since the game just started. That's just me."}

And you must realize that any talk at this point would somehow have to have its roots in the miller discussion, as that is one of the biggest events we have had in the early game. Fails to adress points about inconsistency and scum hunting.<br><blockquote><div><cite>brothers wrote:</cite>And I'll admit my vote on you back on Page 2 was flimsy. It had to be: it was Page 2.

I would argue that, nine times out of ten, claiming miller as early as possible is the right move.

And I thought it looked scummy to actually come out and tell the miller to claim, rather than letting him do it of his own accord. It seemed like he was trying to make sure it was safe for a scumbuddy to claim miller. Because of this sort of thing, when I see a post 1 miller claim, it is a complete null-tell to me.

For the time being, he's either town, or lurking scum.  I'll wait till he starts posting more to get a more accruate read.<br><br>Smear- town.  He seems to be doing well at scumhunting, though I don't like his reasons for voting me.  Again, I'm not the only one who hasn't posted a whole lot.  I say, find a better reason to vote me.<br><br>Subcomfreak- town.  Doing well at scumhunting.  I agree with his theory on the whole miller thing.  I would agree that if anyone claims now or later, I would still vote for them.  He also provides reasons for his votes and actions.<br><br>So, based on my reads,<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">VOTE:DTMaster</span><br><br>any questions?  I'd be glad to answer them."}

Since it's early in the game I would expect lots of vote hopping and people testing the waters. You have no basis to judge the Smear wagon unless you already concluded Smear is town. There's no alignment flips, nor any debates/arguments/attacks to start things off.<br><br>If anything your defence of smear is suspect since you discounted Smear's posts as generic RVS posting. This means that Smear is a null read not a town read since generic RVS posting is just as you said: generic. Smear is not in danger of getting lynched as you attacked Subcom for that reason. The only thing Smear is getting is some heat under his butt with the votes. And that to me is fine and dandy since Lowell is actually doing something about the Smear wagon (see my part 1).<br><br>c. B is truthful since this is a closed setup. A miller is not guarenteed to be in the game with a cop <span class=\"noboldsig\"> because I have a game <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=54&amp;t=14731\" class=\"postlink\">here that proves it</a> </span><br><br>The setup in that game was<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Cow wrote:</cite>Brain Cells still fully working:<br>Faraday, Christopher Nolan, Mafia Godfather<br>DTMaster(rp.

Sanity checks. It is useful for the cop in a normal game to check against the miller to make sure he is sane (i.e. he doesn't have a sanity). In this game <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=14\" class=\"postlink\">here</a> I was a cop and I chose to investigate the miller night 1. I was told I was insane for my night 1 result. (This was later corrected to be that I was Sane since the mod made an error when he sent the results. If you didn't know Insane = Cop sees Town as guilty and Scum as town).<br><br>e. Your reaction to my day kill is null, which is sad. Since you now know it was faked I just note a defensive tone in that post. Considering that I outright claimed a kill on you defensiveness is nulled in this case. But overall your reaction to the vote reads as scummy overall. The miller talk is null, as is the kill. At most it makes me more paranoid that I think I'm wrong, but what eves.<br><br>3. <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3391674#p3391674\" class=\"postlink\">You see with posts like this</a> it makes me think I'm wrong since this is a pretty town post to get Frogster to commit to stronger reads/actions. Which flags the above points above you as something entirely different.<br><br>4. <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3391674#p3391674\" class=\"postlink\">Subcom</a> This is pretty scummy. The fact that you didn't make a Smear read when you vote changed. Especially now that Lowell and Smear has done more of an exhange and you can actually start doing analysis on more posts. You kept Smear as \"weird\" and \"either town or scum\". That's being awfully wishywashy. If you really cared about the weirdness of Smear's posts I'd expect you to follow through on it since you were concerned, like Lowell. You read as buddying scum to Lowell in all of this. <br><br>5. <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3394629#p3394629\" class=\"postlink\">I'm confused</a> Brother. Lowell has been posting every day to this post and it's not enough? Lol wat?<br><br>6. <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3395590#p3395590\" class=\"postlink\">Um we can estimate 3-4 man scum team</a> since that's traditional to the size. More likely 3 then 4. You have any thing more to contribute Guy? <br><br>7. <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3396203#p3396203\" class=\"postlink\">Frogster</a>. So answering BBMolla's question make him scummy? <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3388411#p3388411\" class=\"postlink\">here?</a>. Guy posted a few posts after BBMolla and he's avoiding stuffs... right. That logic makes no sense when it was his first post and it was directly after a fluff/theory question that was posted and directed to everyone in thread. Explain this logic to me.<br><br>8. Now I'm conflicted on Subcom since he's doing a ton of work on his Brother case. Cause that's pretty convincing, and town. Followed by some Smear ownage. But I'm more willing to consider Subcom town (followed by Smear) then Brothers town.<br><br>9. Odd. Guy is also quiet more so <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3399968#p3399968\" class=\"postlink\">here</a>.<br><br>10. Bub is showing towniness over Benoi. I'm willing to agree with Bub since he's following up on his attacks and Benoi is deflecting. So I'm declaring a Bub town read and a Benoi scum read now.<br><br>11. I'm sorry brothers <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3400813#p3400813\" class=\"postlink\">but this is awful</a>. If you really think this was a difference in philosophies generated from the miller talk then you'd realize that differences in philosphies =/= alignment calls. You're arguing that Sub is town in this post when you declared that he's actually scum for distracting the thread. You're back tracking again. I dislike this.<br><br>However as much as I see there's a big tunnel issue as you addressed in this post, I'm highly dissapointed in the transition. Mainly since if you are waffelling that Sub's attacks are more of a playstyle issue rather then an alignment call (i.e. you're considering him to be town despite your original arguments) that you haven't advanced a new case. I remain conflicted in the end since I agree that there is a high level of tunnelling colouring my read of you from this post, but I expected more.<br><br>12. Smear why is Benoi town? Considering that you're defending him from bub's attack you imply that Benoi is town. Explain please. I think Bub's attacks are justified since Benoi deflected.<br><br>I'm a bit tired so this is half my catchup. To be useful<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"> Vote Frog </span>. I need more time to flesh out the Brother's case since my gut is telling me to give it more time. I also skimmed ahead there's tons of Benoi talk. But I disliked Frog's reasoning on Guy's the strongest since I feel like he's coasting a bit, and context wise doesn't make sense. Also I need to reread an exchange since Frog did elaborate on his reasoning on Guy. After that I'd shoot Benoi, then Guy, then Brothers as according to my read as current suspects."}

Smear seems to modulate his opinions to what he perceives the town as thinking, but seems also reluctant to vote on any wagon of consequence. Smear thinks Brothers is townish, then as soon as he's gone, I guess he feels safe saying Brothers is scum again.<br><br>Here's smear on the GNR wagon.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3410838#p3410838\" class=\"postlink\">post 130</a>, Smear wrote:</cite><span class=\"noboldsig\">Vote: Guy_Named_Riggs</span><br><br>Blatantly coasting.

Check this, though: as soon as Frogsterking votes GNR in #154, Smear gives us this:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3418676#p3418676\" class=\"postlink\">post 157</a>, Smear wrote:</cite><span class=\"noboldsig\">Unvote</span><br><br>I'll try to reread later and post any reads.</div></blockquote><br><br>and then follows it up with:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3421115#p3421115\" class=\"postlink\">post 167</a>, Smear wrote:</cite>Brothers is probably scum, but I need to wait for his replacement<br>Guy: seems scummy<br>Benoni: scummiest(besides Brothers)<br>Lobster: hard to say<br>Frog: hard to read, but I lean town because of Guy's scumminess<br>Lowell: seemed a little strange at first but probably town<br>Subcom: I lean town, he campaigned very strongly against Brothers<br>BB: I lean town<br>Nikanor: seems town<br>DTM: seems town<br>Bud: seems  town</div></blockquote><br><br>In short, he votes GNR then immediately unvotes even though he still thinks GNR is scum. Bro, if he's scummy, why you unvoting? There was a big lot of pressure developing--getting up to L-3 in #183--but Smear wants no part of pressure. Soon as pressure develops, he bows out. It's the way he rolls.<br><br>Finally, here's Smear on the Frogster wagon. He votes Frogster in #206. In response to the mounting pressure, Frogster offers a limp defense. Smear has this to say:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3436574#p3436574\" class=\"postlink\">post 218</a>, Smear wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3436513#p3436513\" class=\"postlink\">post 217</a>, Frogsterking wrote:</cite>Hey u guys r supposed to lynch the mafia lmao</div></blockquote><br><br>lol nice defense<br>really convincing...</div></blockquote><br><br>Smear is unconvinced by Frogster's defense.

Smear's posts seem calculated to look townish, but soon as some town thinks otherwise you get a whiplash change of opinion from Smear. He wants to fit in with the town, but never be a part of a lynch... he sheeps others' opinions so much he sheeps himself into contradictions... looks like scum, smells like scum, quacks like scum."}

I finally I'm all caught up and ready to do this thing. I'll start out with my reads. <br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">BBmolla</span>: Null-town. His post are a bit infrequent and short and he hasn't really done much to set himself apart or contribute to the town. He gives a bit of a town vibe, but at the same time, he could be lurker scum.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">benoni</span>: Town. His avatar reminds me of a Klansman for some reason... I'm not sure if there is any significance to voting for Bub but not brothers earlier on, but since brothers wasn't scum, I can't see any. <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3479613#p3479613\" class=\"postlink\">Post #275</a> pretty much solidified in my mind that he's town. It's just solid csework that seems like genuine scumhunting.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Bub Bidderskins</span>: Scum. One of the things that many have praised as a townie action, making cases for people being town, is one of the things that has me the most worried about him. It's just good scum play to do that kind of stuff, because it cements town reads and gains you friends. It is a very subtle version of buddying. Scum know who is town, so if they pick a couple people and decide to protect them subtly, then hey eliminate people from their mislynch pool, but if they can survive until LyLo with those people, then they have an easy win. That said, it could just as easily be town motivated, but for starters, the way he's posted this game just vibes scummy to me, but also, I don't think his defenses are as solid as he makes them out to be. I mean, that whole thing with GNR's \"town-slip\" seems like horse shit to me. If anything, I'd call it a null tell, leaning scum playing ignorant. To me it's akin to saying \"oh shit\" when the Cop is night killed; town could say it, but it feels more like something scum trying to look town would say.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">DTMaster</span>: Null. Needs a replacement, since he hasn't posted in over 2 weeks. His posts are mostly incomprehensible and barely worth my time to read.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Frogsterking</span>: Scum. <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3390740#p3390740\" class=\"postlink\">Post #45</a> makes no sense to me as a case. He doesn't actually do a lot of casework when he votes, so it's not easy to see any of his reasoning and he certainly doesn't strike me as having town motivation. I also don't like Bub's adamant defense of him or vice versa, though it seems strange that they would so openly watch out for each other as scum buddies. Not to say that they aren't, because I fully think that they are.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Guy_Named_Riggs</span>: Scum-lean. He's defensive, which I've gone on record before is not scummy in and of itself and I hold to that, but coupled with his general lack of scumhunting and his constant mantra of \"I'm town\" and \"why do you suspect me?\" I'm sort of leaning scum. At the same time, he gives off a new-town vibe, s it's only a minor scum read.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Jackal711/Nikanor</span>: Null. Jackal's done nothing but answer the RQS questions and Nikanor... why do they both have cat-themed avatars? Anyway, distractions aside, Nikanor has not really done anything this game either.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Lobstermania</span>: Null. Man, there are a lot of inactive people in this game.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Lowell</span>: Null. There needs to be more elaborations from him. Never found out why he voted Bub in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3391334#p3391334\" class=\"postlink\">Post #51</a> and I can't really tell where his head is at right now.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Smear</span>: Scum-lean. What can I say that hasn't already been said by benoni? Mot much.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Subcomfreak</span>: Town. The main reason aside from just generally good posting is his vote and continued pressure on Bub. Too many people have been letting Bub get by for too long with virtually no scrutiny and I've personally had enough of it. The only thing that has me concerned is his ridiculously strong suspicion of Brothers. But I'm willing to accept that sometimes people are just wrong.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Frogsterking</span><br><br>I want to say that's L-1 and I personally endorse a hammer, since we have a claim from him.<br><br>And my answers to the RVS questions are<br><br>1.

It's the way he rolls.<br><br>Finally, here's Smear on the Frogster wagon. He votes Frogster in #206. In response to the mounting pressure, Frogster offers a limp defense. Smear has this to say:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3436574#p3436574\" class=\"postlink\">post 218</a>, Smear wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3436513#p3436513\" class=\"postlink\">post 217</a>, Frogsterking wrote:</cite>Hey u guys r supposed to lynch the mafia lmao</div></blockquote><br><br>lol nice defense<br>really convincing...</div></blockquote><br><br>Smear is unconvinced by Frogster's defense.

Smear pollutes the town with fake votes, fake scumhunting, nice balanced safe agreeable opinions, then chickens out once a wagon develops. Smear's posts seem calculated to look townish, but soon as some town thinks otherwise you get a whiplash change of opinion from Smear. He wants to fit in with the town, but never be a part of a lynch... he sheeps others' opinions so much he sheeps himself into contradictions... looks like scum, smells like scum, quacks like scum.</div></blockquote><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3480996#p3480996\" class=\"postlink\">post 280</a>, benoni wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3480893#p3480893\" class=\"postlink\">post 279</a>, Subcomfreak wrote:</cite>What?

I read this as scummy at the time, and I still think it's scummy. He goes on to make a case against brothers. Either he's scum and that was a response to pressure, or he's town and was just holding those thoughts in his head and refrained from voting. Right now, I don't know which one is the case.<br><br>Later he manages to get on the GNR wagon at a <span style=\"font-style: italic\">very</span> convenient time with very little explanation, and his brothers vote is totally forgotton (although in fairness, the fact that he forgot the brothers vote could simply be because of Brothers' flaking).<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Benoi wrote:</cite>@Cojin<br><br>Does Brothers have a replacement yet?</div></blockquote><br><br>I stand correct it, forgetting the brothers vote is a null point, but he still displayed <span style=\"font-style: italic\">perfect</span> timing in getting on that GNR wagon, and he didn't want to admit that GNR was town.<br><br>His case on Smear is pretty good, though. And despite me attacking him constanty he still thinks I'm town, which makes me think he's honestly trying to find scum rather than defend himself, although that could go either way."}

If he survives the night and nobody extra dies, it means that his claim is either fake or he's been roleblocked. At that point, we can discuss the merits of lynching him versus letting him live versus lynching him. So right now I think that we need to look at Bub more closely.

A town slip makes no sense because scum can pick there words in such a way that they look town. It's easy and extremely basic for scum to play dumb so it looks like they have no idea what they are doing. And the fact that he uses this as a case against benoni and goes as far as to call Riggs confirmed town based solely on this \"slip\" is fucking laughable.<br><br>Frogster: \"Definitely town\" for unexplained reason in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3437750#p3437750\" class=\"postlink\">#219</a>, which he then goes on to explain are because he didn't freak out when people were voting him. The problem with this is that newb town are just as likely to freak the fuck out when they are being voted for if that is there inclination. I remember in my first game ever, I got voted for some random reason and I just brushed it off, but then it turned into a wagon because I didn't defend my self and I started freaking the fuck out and trying to defend myself as best as possible. The point of this story is that there's nothing inherently town about being nonchalant when people are voting you.<br><br>Also, again with the town slip bullshit. Saying \"gogo town\" at L-1 is 1. not a slip and 2. not even a towntell. It's in line with his general attitude of not giving a fuck, but apathy is not a towntell.<br><br>Subcomfreak: Town because he shamelessly cast a lazy vote? Nothing about that is remotely town.<br><br>benoni: Bub has a really sweet setup here. On one hand, benoni is one of his major targets, on the other hand, he's created some flip-flop room by making statements such as \"despite me attacking him constanty he still thinks I'm town, which makes me think he's honestly trying to find scum rather than defend himself, although that could go either way\" so that he can call him town now, but still get back on him if the winds start blowing in that direction. And by setting up the theory that is Smear is town, benoni is scum and vice versa, he can jump on the wagon tomorrow should one be lynched today.<br><br>As I hope you can all see, many of these town proclamations are half-cocked and far stronger than they have any right to be. And I use the word 'proclamation' rather than 'read' because a read implies certain things. For starters, it's typically backed up by some legitimate reasoning. And the reads aren't made with such force. It's not particularly in the town's best interest to speak in such absolutes over such paltry reasons. <br><br>What's more, proclaiming other players as town is not an inherently town action. There's plenty of trust to be gained by calling people town rather than calling them scum. It's a great way to manipulate people and get them to trust you. You know you are town and having someone out there who has your back feels comforting, but it just luls you into a false sense of security. Buddying is dangerous."}

Wait,<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">@smear, how many shots you got?</span></div></blockquote><br>I wouldn't be willing to bet that Bub was telling the truth on his own. First of all, Frogster continues to look independently scummy, especially with his current frantic defense of Bub. Second, I am not sure he's do it that way because if his plan backfired, he'd easily get his team lynched. From a scum perspective, it's good to get at least one buddy some towncred too and the fact that he's naming so many people town means that we can't possibly determine who is one of his buddies in there.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Regarding Smear</span>: There's no reason to make it a public target. Doing so is just more likely to get us screwed. There are many more bad scenario's if we get him to make a public shot rather than a private shot. Public decisions are better for things like Doctor or Jailkeeper. Aggressive roles like Cop or Vig can be sabotaged more easily if the target is known. They could kill and roleblock him if it's scum he is targeting or they could take it that direction even if it is town so that we think it's scum. They could kill the same person. It's arguably a waste of a kill, but when only one kill goes through, we are less inclined to trust him and so he can be mislynched more easily. They could simply roleblock him and keep him alive and kill someone else, though admittedly, they could do so even if his target isn't public. By leaving it on him to decide, we cut down scum responsiveness, which is a plus. And he shouldn't claim his number of shots either. If he has less shots, it makes him less of a threat and he'll be less likely to be targeted when it would be better if he was and if he has no limit, it will make him a higher priority when he shouldn't be. One shot also means that they can let him shoot once without them shooting and from then on they can kill while he looks bad or vice cersa, he can be scum hiding behind the fact that he can't shoot anymore. <br><br>Also, I'm just putting it out there, but I think I'm likely the kill target tonight. I'd normally be content in my towniness that I would likely have Doc protection or at least that there would be the threat of Doc protection and so the mafia wouldn't come for me, but in this situation, I've got a few problems. <br><br>1. I replaced into a slot people think is scum. <br>2. We have two claimed town PRs that are more likely to get protection. <br>3. We've got a Vig claim who could also potentially shoot me. <br>4. I'm about to get scum lynched, probably.<br><br>@<span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Everyone</span>: So in case I do die, I've got a couple things to say: <br><br>Frogster should probably be lynched soon. He seems like scum who thinks trolling is a valid strategy to stay alive. <br><br>Don't trust CooLDoG/Subcomfreak. His interaction with Bub could be a bus for massive towncred. Don't dismiss anybody, because you never know when they are just amazing scum. Something seems off about his play, including him riding Jackal for his reason for claiming when at this point, it doesn't matter because it's true. It was dumb as shit to do, but there's really no reason to dwell on it. Also, I don't care for the way he's handled the Smear claim. It could be that I just have a different way of handling the claim, but the fact that so many negative things could happen based on what he's requested of Smear makes me more than a bit wary.<br><br>Don't quick-lynch Smear just because there is no night kill. Scum will try to set up any mislynch they can and constantly blocking Smear, if they've got a Roleblocker, is a great way to take away trust. Give him two or three days to get a shot off before you lynch him. And it should go without saying that there should be no counter-claim. If there is a real Vig, fucking shoot Smear.<br><br>Main reason I'm saying this stuff is because I have no idea where the vote count is.<br><br>Remember not to hammer until he has claimed. I think for the sake of safety, it's better if we get him at L-2 with two people expressing intent to vote him, so that as scum he can't self-hammer and as a PR, scum can't quick-hammer after his claim. My theory right now is that scum Bub is more likely to claim PR while to town Bub is more likely to claim VT with the sad irony being that we should lynch in the situation where he's more likely to be town and let him live in the situation where he's more likely to be scum."}

What I did was make it seem like I'd be a likely target so that I could plant the idea in the mind of the Mafia that targeting me is a good idea and subtlety direct the Doc in my direction so that we'd have a chance to avoid a kill altogether. And if not, perhaps the Mafia would see through that and n not come after me. Or they would target me and a PR would survive. I have no particular problem dying when it's necessary, but I think at this point a sharp mind is more important than a power role, so keeping myself around is advantageous.

And the reason they'd kill me is because, the slot is becoming less scummy as I post. I have a tendency to have that affect, because I'm a very pro-town player and I realize that. In addition, I also realize that I am a very useful player and a scum flip from Bub makes me a very dangerous player to them. As I said, a sharp mind is sometimes better than a power role. What good is a PR if you can't put it to use properly, not to say that the current claimed PRs can't put their powers to use properly, just that I think I'm an overall more useful player."}

We'll see how Bub fips and then Frogster and from there we'll see who scum is. My money right now is on you, but we'll see what happens in time. You really should state your case on me so I can prove how wrong you are. My understanding at this point is that brothers replaced out (which is not a scumtell, by the way) and I think that I tried to influence the Doctor, which again isn't even remotely a scumtell. There is nothing wrong with directing PRs as long as you do it right."}

I'd suggest saving his lynch for as long as possible in hopes of hitting a Roleblocker, as Mafia are more likely to kill him if we hit the Roleblocker. However, we will probably need to take him out before we reach LyLo if we don't get the Roleblocker, because in LyLo, a Vig is useless and we probably don't want to gamble the game on that."}

I guess my frustration here is that they should have been lynched after they claimed a non PR at deadline.

Look how he actually believes the dayvig non-claim from DTM and then rationalizes he must be scum because the person didn't lie so the claim was fake.  Is newb-mafia making that post?  No.  If they believed the dayvig claim, they would do their best to not annoy them by voting them and getting attention.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">jackal</span>/replacement.

Why would you have been a target if your predecessor was a scum read for many players?  Why would you be a target with 2 town PRs claimed?</div></blockquote><br>Three reasons. First, I always assume myself to be a scum target, because I view myself as a legitimate threat to mafia. Second, I expected my public image to turn around with the lynch of Bub, but him flipping town sort of threw a wrench in that plan. And as we saw with the death of Lowell, the concern I had wasn't unfounded. Third, I had become one of the more active and vocal players, which is dangerous in a game filled with inactive players. It becomes much harder to coast like that.<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3564246#p3564246\" class=\"postlink\">post 495</a>, bionicchop2 wrote:</cite>OK, so game read is done.

Since I haven't reread the game yet and t has been so long, I don't really remember what the player list looks like right now. The reason I asked was two-fold. First, it's to see where your head is now. I like to have regular reads from everyone so I can see how their game progresses to see if it seems like a natural progression or if it just contrived. Second, if there is something that seems off to you, even if it is relatively small, it could still be worthwhile to bring it up to the town, in case they have noticed other things about the person too that you may have missed or so they now have information that they may have missed and so they can make a more informed decision.<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3565043#p3565043\" class=\"postlink\">post 498</a>, bionicchop2 wrote:</cite>2.

The way I see it, its a way to increase the likelihood that they are scum. If they are a heavy scum read and I think that they are likely to get lynched later in the game anyway, I think it's better to kill them both at the same time, because even if they are both mislynches, at least we don't also have an extra day wasted and a night kill in the middle, so in a way, it balances out.<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3565043#p3565043\" class=\"postlink\">post 498</a>, bionicchop2 wrote:</cite>3.

I'd honestly call Vig a pretty solid claim for scum. More than Cop, definitely. For one thing, I think that if the set up isn't open, a Vig is more unlikely to be counter-claimed. Also, they can proceed to use the Roleblocked excuse from that point forward or the excuse that they hit the same person as Mafia. On top of that, they can use the excuse that Mafia aren't Nigh killing them later in the game even after the Roleblocker dies (if one even exists) by claiming that Mafia might want them to mess up and take out town. And the worst part is, it could all be true. An early Vig claim from town is extremely bad for the player, but extremely useful for a scum player.<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3565043#p3565043\" class=\"postlink\">post 498</a>, bionicchop2 wrote:</cite>4.

All it takes is that right type of player. I've said from the moment that I started playing Mafia that my strategy as scum would be to play the game exactly as if I were town so that no contradictions or strange motivations appear in my play. I think that if anything, newer players can be more dangerous as scum, because if they are playing with this sentiment, it's harder to catch and there is no meta to look back on for them to see that.<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3565043#p3565043\" class=\"postlink\">post 498</a>, bionicchop2 wrote:</cite>5.

You're question for me really comes down to whether or not I think CooLDoG is scum or if I think that they quietly sheeped the wagon. This is the main thing I plan to look at in my reread.

My reread doesn't change things much. His early game softball with my predecessor before finally laying into him hard reads to me as him trying to be lenient with with a new player, before finally losing his patience with all of his waffling about.

DTMaster was nearly useless as far as I'm concerned, but bionicchop has been of far more use.

He's been on my slot almost all game for some <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3524680#p3524680\" class=\"postlink\">half-assed reasons</a>. In addition, he's been doing little but coasting on the \"found scum team, gg\" thing since yesterday. One of his 4 suspects has flipped town, another is a claimed PR, the third I know to be town, and the fourth I currently suspect to be town. Seems to me he was trying to set up multiple lynches he could use to coast through the game on so that he wouldn't have to fake scumhunt anymore. I'm willing to admit that there may be some bias against him because he's attacking me, but I don't think so, because it's more the manner he's doing it in than anything else. In particular yesterday with the Doctor, I felt it was an attempt to twist the situation against me rather than actually trying to call what I did scummy, particularly since there was nothing about it that was scummy. I also don't like his obsession with Jackal's claim. It was a dumb claim, I admit, but what's done is done and his harping on it and making threats against Jackal because of it reads to me as trying to get a mislynch on a PR.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Frogsterking</span>: Town-lean.

I was so focused on his bad logic being scummy that I didn't stop to think that he could just have bad logic without being scum. I mean, if he really was scum, he had every chance to jump on the Bub wagon too, but he constantly supported Bub. Plain and simple, I was wrong about him.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Guy_Named_Riggs</span>: Scum-lean. I get the idea that he is feigning ignorance at some points. To date, he has asked what a miller is, how many mafia there re, and he put forward that DTMaster might be a Day Vig in the same post that he voted him. The third thing is the part that has me most suspicious. Why even mention it when he is obviously not the Day Vig at that point and furthermore, it is slightly suspect to me that he knows what a DAy Vig is, but not a Miller. It's not a huge thing, but it is nonetheless something that doesn't sit well with me. Aside from that, just wanting to sort of hang back until discussion starts up again is kind of null. It could be newb-town motivated or scum motivated. Either way, we need <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">EVERYBODY</span> to contribute as much as possible.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Jackal711/Nikanor</span>: Town. I don't think that he's a scum PR and his claim is obviously true. He could end up being useful, because as log as he is alive, MyLo will be delayed. I look forward to seeing more activity from him, as near-confirmed town.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">HowardRoark/Mega</span>: Town-lean. I honestly didn't even know his slot existed for like the first half of the game and he didn't get into it until near the end of Day 1, so there isn't a lot to go on, but what he does have so far looks really good to me. He came into the game pushing people with personalized questions for every person, which seems like genuine scumhunting instead of cookie cutter scumhunting you see from lazy town and scum. Also, his concise and logical BBmolla case seems like legitimate scumhunting.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">RandomActs/Lobstermania</span>: Null-scum. Still remains mostly null, but there is a tinge of scuminess there in that he jumped on the Bub wagon, which was town, almost right off the bat, which could have been an attempt at a mislynch as much as it could be actual suspicion. He also expressed suspicion of benoni for what I feel are poorly-defined reasons. I'd like to see an elaboration of that.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Smear</span>: Town-lean. I believe his claim and I have a theory about last night. I feel like an idiot for missing it, since it was so completely obvious, but I'd be unsurprised if there had been a Doc save last night. I hadn't even considered the Doctor when this Day began for some reason. It makes more sense to me than scum deciding that Lowell was a bigger threat than either claimed PR. Of course, I'm sure we'll hear from him and he can clear it up and if there is a Doc out there, he probably knows too, but he shouldn't claim. That said, this read is dependent on Smear confirming that he is Vig, which shouldn't be too hard now. If my theory is correct, then there almost assuredly isn't a Roleblocker, which means that we should be seeing two kills tomorrow night and a Doc visit wouldn't be misplaced on Smear. Of course, if there is not confirmation that he is the Vig and he plays scummy, then it means we've got an elaborate scum ploy going on here.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: BBmolla</span><br><br>Let's get some conversation going now.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">@Everyone</span>: I've already said this, but I'll reiterate, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">POST YOUR READS</span>.

Frogster has had moments of insight and while his play is at times questionable, it's not honestly that bad. GNR, on the other hand, has delivered less than acceptable levels of content and is now basically refusing to add more. Interesting that you decide to comment specifically on those and ignore the cases against you. Trying to act nonchalant? I suppose your comment will be tomorrow though, so it's not a big deal, I just found it interesting that you had time to object to my reads on two people whose alignments you should have no way of discerning, but you can't be bothered to defend yourself. And maybe next time instead of just calling the reads bad, you can explain why you think they are bad, okay?"}

It's only a minor thing and it is in fact quite possible that you knew what a Day Vig was but not a Miller, it just seems like a far more unlikely scenario to me.

You obviously aren't going to let it spiral out of control and I can assure you, neither am I.

We're far better waiting until the two unresponsive have officially been removed from the game so that the mod can look for players during the Night Phase.

I'd appreciate if you'd  stop calling me \"the brothers slot\". I've been here longer, posted more, and the majority of your case against me now would seem to be against mysef rather than brothers, which I assume is due to your case against him being weak.<br><br>2. Directing power roes is not only not scummy, I believe it is extremely pro-town. And considering that's been my stance on the subject since I started playing on this site. Check my past games, if you want. I can even provide links if necessary. That's simply the way I play the game and if that is one of the key points of your case against me, then you are clearly grasping at straws.<br><br>3. What exactly does \"being wrong about a townie\" mean? Surely you can't be referring to the Bub wagon. You were on that wagon too. Technically before even me. And there were a lot of others who apparently felt he was fairly scummy. The only difference is that I did almost all of the casework and you just kind of egged me on while at the same time attacking me. And if you aren't talking about Bub, then I have no idea what you are talking about, since he's the only townie I can recall being wrong about so far. Also, when did being wrong become a scumtell?

Second reason was to make it more likely something would happen with CooLDoG. I felt since we couldn't be sure of the state of affairs with Smear, it was entirely possible there might not be a shot tonight. Third reason is because I believe that CooLDoG may be a strong player and so I am hoping that if the Cop investigated him, he won't claim if CooLDoG is scum and I have a clear shot at lynching him. On the other hand, if he should start to wriggle from my clutches, a well-timed Cop claim would be most useful. When I have scum in my sights, I like to make sure there is no escape.<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3580152#p3580152\" class=\"postlink\">post 611</a>, bionicchop2 wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3580111#p3580111\" class=\"postlink\">post 610</a>, Hikari Link wrote:</cite><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">@Scum</span>: The Doctor doesn't even have to listen to me, so have some WIFOM.

If he's got a story, I want to hear it. I've got a few ideas why it may have gotten this way, but I'd rather not say anything and hand him excuses to hide behind. You can go ahead and have all the scum reads on people not voting him, but the list is going to get pretty long at the rate things are going. It's far more pro-town to wait it out to be safe anyway and as far as I'm concerned, this is entirely your problem at this point. How about you get some real, defined reads out there instead of just coasting on \"lol Smear is confirmed scum\", because you're going to jump to the to of my scum list if the flip comes and he's town somehow.<br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3601231#p3601231\" class=\"postlink\">post 657</a>, Guy_Named_Riggs wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3600776#p3600776\" class=\"postlink\">post 654</a>, Hikari Link wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3600512#p3600512\" class=\"postlink\">post 653</a>, Guy_Named_Riggs wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=3599931#p3599931\" class=\"postlink\">post 650</a>, Hikari Link wrote:</cite>Does your signature really say that you are V/LA 7 days a week?

What I'm more concerned about is your lack of content. Your wagon-hopping is not helping anyone determine your alignment or actually find scum, and is in fact, harmful, so please get to work.

Keep that up until he gets back and we can hear his story. That applies for his replacement too.

The lack of content bothers me, but based on the activity of others in this game, I find it hard to consider it independently scummy so much as just unhelpful. But don't mistake my leniency for complacency. At this point, GNR is still #2 on my list after CooLDoG, but I'm not actually pushing for any lynches at this moment. Content is the #1 priority at this point in the game. Since your V/LA  is over, can we expect reads from you soon?

And what happened to the reads you claimed to be making before BBmolla was lynched. You've had ample time since then. You've even had time for partial reads lists as originally requested. Where are these things at? For you, 72 hours is a deadline and I expect content by then. There are only 9 players and from that, we have one confirmed town and yourself, so there are only 7 players you need to read. I expect at least 3 of those by the time 72 hours have passed and the rest by Saturday evening at the latest.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">@Frogster</span>: You need to post as well.

That's not even a reason. I just consider that you being a dick. Though scum are more likely to pester town to fluster them. There was your shit hop off the Smear wagon, which seemed to be just because of some random shit that Frogster said, followed by a ridiculous jump on me for some vague \"connections\" to GNR, despite the fact that I was the staunchest supporter of not lynching someone that you've apparently conceded could in all likeliness be town. And your insistence to push the Smear wagon up until the point it became clear it wouldn't happen. It didn't read to me like \"oh shit, I guess this guy could be town and I'd be a fool not to easily test his claim,\" it was more like \"oh shit, I guess people aren't going to go through with this, let's sheep Frogster.\" You were so adamant about that lynch and that alone set off all sorts of alarms. Added to that, the ease at which you claimed to flip reads on him from what was basically a watered-down and poorly executed version of my responses don't seem like legitimate reactions."}

All those nulls aren't going to cut it and the lack of any particular examples simply isn't god enough.

A comment about me knowing BBmolla would flip scum, so I asked for the protect.

Me telling calling for unvotes so that we could sort the rest of the stuff out before the Day ended.<br><br>5. An explanation of when that post was. My only guess is that he assumed that me calling for unvotes meant that I was calling BBmolla town,when clearly what I was trying to do was getting thing things squared away, which is why when the hammer came down, I had to rush out all of my pre-Night statements.<br><br>6.

If we are going to put off your death, which it's probably best that we do despite how obviously scum you are, then it's best that we give you the best possible chance for you to prove yourself by letting your shot through. If you are Vig, then announcing your target just increases the chances that scum will try to shoot at the same person as you so that we'll mislynch you tomorrow. I may have an idea up my sleeve though. I'll post my idea for you and the Doc tomorrow and we can decide on a redFF or GNR lynch. <br><br>I need to reevaluate both to see which has the greater chance of flipping scum. GNR has had an extremely newbie edge to him the entire time, but at the same time, his complete lack of content and some of his more questionable comments have me wondering. On the other hand, redFF has tunneled on people hard for fairly illegitimate reasons. Still, something about his recent posts reads town. Not his \"lol scum team caught\" attitude, but the other stuff. <br><br>This is probably going to be a hard sell because the majority of my case here is lack of content, but I'd honestly say that I think RandomActs might be the best candidate, because we're a bit close to the deadline and I don't think there is enough time to fully evaluate bvoigt. Again, this is something I'll have to elaborate on tomorrow."}
