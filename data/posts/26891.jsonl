Also, l-2 on a shite wagon? does that no raise an eyebrow?<br>\n<br>\nWe are, what 5 pages into the game? There are no certain town or certain cum reads.

On one hand we have the fact that the scum MUST stay alive in order to win. There is a direct correlation between not getting lynched and winning the game. So from that standpoint cowbell is town.<br>\n<br>\nBut, if you look at it from another direction... it reads as null. Firstly scum knows that the town knows that they need to stay alive. Therefore, cow could be faking his defeatism in order to feign townieness. It is also worth noting that his wagon would have been a great opportunity to start a counter wagon on someone on his own wagon. He could have scumhunted more from his wagon.

The fact you've only voted twice means nothing.<br>\nThe fact that Fegel was active means nothing.

See that is the problem. YOur \"self meta\" is only used to help you survive and not catch scum. Therefore there is little town motivation for doing it.<br>\n<br>\nAlso, keep in mind that this is page 17. How much can we really go off of meta d1. In order to have a decent sized sample for meta to be relevant at all then we must have more than a few posts by one person. We have very little to even validate if om's self meta is actually consistent with his play right now. <br>\n<br>\nAlso, to make an addition to the case...<br>\n<br>\nNote how when OM has only 2 votes on him (a far cry from a lynch or a wagon) he goes insane. Super hyper defensive. Every post he makes is centered around himself, and himself only. Note that he ceases to scum hunt and only concentrates on his defense. He only has 2 votes on him. Keep that in mind. It is clear that om's motivation to stay alive is several times greater than catching scum. This motivation indicates a scum alignment as opposed to a town one.  I think we could gain a lot of information from om's wagon and eventual lynch.<br>\n<br>\nI still like yolo.

A players actions should stand on their own merit. However, I am willing to concede that meta could be useful in order to show, without a doubt, that om's motivation for using such meta is only for his personal gain, instead of that of the town.

That allows him to not worry about getting lynched himself and to push whatever lynch he wants with a group of people who will \"follow the leader\".

His posts aren't bad though, just impossible to get a read off of.</div><br>\nOm of the Nom <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">A mixed bag very much. Seems to be townish in some posts, scummy in some others. I wouldn't call him scum yet though.</div><br>\nCheery Dog <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">His play's just been very odd, and not very townish.

From a wagon that needed only 3 votes to lynch 24 hours from deadline... a wagon from nothing lynched town.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nSo who is that mystery person? Well, in my honest opinion it has to be one of these:<br>\nAnkamius, penguin_alien, MrBump, or Ztife. There is no way that the feg wagon could have been derailed only by feg and town. Of the four, <br>\n<br>\nMrBump doesn't seem like it, my personal view here. Others may disagree.<br>\n<br>\nAnkamius has a decent probability, but he did adamantly call cheery scum and HE WAS ABLE TO CHANGE HIS VOTE if he needed to. With this being the case there was no reason for ank to not see where the wagon went. There was nothing to lose, all to gain. <br>\n<br>\nPenguin has a very high chance of being scum. He basically came out and aid he was voting for a lost cause. But to be fair to penguin he did actually say that feg wasn't scum in his first post in game. Maybe he could have voted in time... who knows.<br>\n<br>\nThat leaves zitfe, which is where I personally think the blame for the wagon lies. No votes for cheery until it reached 4v4. only one page before, when the cheery wagon was just starting, zitfe was warming up to the feg wagon. Cheery was far from his posts. BUT MAN RIGHT WHEN IT HIT TE TIPPING POINT. Boom muda fucka. Gonna vote that. Zitfe derailed the wagon. Zitfe lynched town. Zitfe was condemned by cheery dog (for what ever it is worth).

So I'm with Bump on this one, Feg please explain why it's particularly bad.<br>\n<br>\nRD's attacks on me in his wall post basically revolve around me trying to derail the Feg wagon (who I claimed was a townread at that time). Firstly, that relies on Feg being scum, because if Feg is town, me trying to derail it wouldn't make sense. Secondly, I wasn't here when the Cheery wagon grew massively, so I can't really have been the main focal point between the derailment of the Feg wagon and the growth of the Cheery wagon. I had openly called Cheery town and I had openly called Feg town. Above all I had openly claimed that my intentions were just to get a lynch before the deadline hit. My last ditch effort to try and get a wagon on a top scumread (MrBump) was just a hopeful pastime which I would have been happy if it had succeeded, but it succeeding was not entirely necessary for any further progression.<br>\nRD how strongly would you think I'm scum if Feg flips town? You do have some merit in that case if Feg flips scum, sure I'll admit that, but I don't really see how that makes me scum if Feg's town.<br>\n<br>\nFeg isn't logically a scumread for me, but I get bad gut feelings from his posts and unless he does something super scummy my read's probably gonna stay that way. At this stage I'd only really lynch him for deadline reasons (but it's not like that can't change).<br>\n<br>\nI'm not opposed to a Ztife wagon tbh, I've never really given a read on him but he's never really swayed my opinion either way. His place on the Cheery wagon is too convenient, other than that I don't really have much on him. Not a prime suspect but still weary.<br>\n<br>\nHonestly I'm getting bad feelings from SAS still. They're way too lurky considering they're a hydra. I know Venmar posts a fair bit normally and I don't want him to have the chance to lurk to victory if he's scum. Pressure on them will come soon hopefully.<br>\n<br>\nBump was the 4th vote on Cheery, when the Cheery lynch still wasn't inevitable and Feg was the leading wagon. I don't like this but I can't ignore the fact that Bump had consistently had Feg as a townread (however consistency isn't always a good thing so it's not like he's town for that).<br>\n<br>\nPenguin_Alien was the 3rd vote and she hopped on with a pretty shit reason that was basically a parrot. Do not like this either.<br>\n<br>\nDon and RD are pretty much town.

In the essence of it at that point cherry dog was not doing much of scum hunting, or anything in particular actually. The convenient sheeping on feg's wagon was a good example of how scums jump on a wagon without a good case near deadline. Did he convince me that he thought feg was scummy? No. Did he feel like he wants to talk about it? No.<br>\n<br>\nIts easy to crap out statements like \"there must be a scum on the mislynch wagon\" when we're not actually looking at the scum hunting.<br>\nWhile we can argue about whether cherry dog seems scummy or not at that point, you must agree that I was one of the first few players who actually mentioned and draw attention to him. The only reason I didn't vote for him then its because I was still pushing for a YOLO lynch whom I think was actual scum then (re-reads needed from D1 N1 results which I've yet to do).<br>\n<br>\nFeg was not a strong lynch as I had mentioned, and at the 4/4 feg/cherry point it seems that a cherry lynch was more likely, because most people voting for feg was in it to prevent a NL (or so I assumed).

But what the fuck are you going to do if feg flips town? What do you think happened between the feg/CD wagon in D1? Have you considered the possibility that feg and cherry are both town? It would have been easy for scums to sit back and do nothing, because either way it would have landed a mislynch.

The fact that feg \"led\" a wagon? Lets get a couple of things straight over here.<br>\n<br>\nAnybody who is getting lynched should be trying to get someone else. That's normal behaviour, unless we're talking about some sort of gambit. Town does that, scum does that. Having a crapass defeatist attitute like RC did in the first few couple of pages only serves to show how anti-town that is. Even if you are getting lynched, you generate discussions for scums to flip on consistancy. Therefore the fact that Feg has voted on someone else before his wagon died is WIFOM on his alignment.<br>\n<br>\nThat replacing out is a crap move, not too sure what I think about that.<br>\n<br>\nI could be sold if you could actually come up with a proper case. The idea of an NL would have been ideal for scum as well. The fact that scums would wanna derail feg's wagon and also risk exposure voting for CD just seems farfetched to me. I should probably read and comment alot more about the wagon on CD, but the fact that it was close to deadline makes the cases weak. We have to choose between 2 reads evens if we think they are weak just to prevent an NL, town is as likely to have weak votes as scums.

Most people voting for feg was trying to go for an easy lynch or prevent an NL.<br>\n<br>\nHow exactly did the cherry wagon change your read on feg? You have failed to explain this repeatedly. What im trying to tell you is, your case is bad, not only you did not try to reinforce your case but your insisting on your sub-par scum hunting which fails to show any logic. You are also giving players like DJ with and RC with no proper explaination about their votes or whatsoever to get away with sheeping votes on Feg. Lynch him because he didn't get lynch D1? What a bunch of crap logic.<br>\n<br>\nAnd just to show how wifom your logic is, if CD flipped scum does it mean that feg is town? No.<br>\n<br>\nYour dissection of CD's wagon, think about how scum could be lying the midst of lurkers like SAS, evil, akam, they practically have almost little to nothing in the posts. If we lynch feg now, IF he had turns out to be town, we'll be left with nothing to start D3 with. Your gambit that all 3 scum would be on CD's wagon is misleading, the lack of wagoning in D1 shows that scums are just lying around and letting town rot by itself at the rate we're going. There issin't even any pressure for the lurkers to stop lurking. If you have town interest in mind, make a better case and convince people to start voting for feg. Otherwise, take a look at the lurkers and start pressure voting. IIRC you mentioned that YOLO slot was scummy, and evil did practically nothing after he replaced.

(He'd want to be believed if he had a role to claim and so would have wanted to claim early enough not to look like opportunistic scum)  Of course, if he was really thinking I was scum, he should have wanted me not second-to-last on his claim order, which also makes me think he's changing his read to kiss up to RC.

When he was in no danger of being lynched, no real reason to reveal his role and limits, no reason to give scum any more information other than slips. There was 8 players left with 1 scum date, town was in no danger of losing nor any visible disadvantage. And his reason is because he wants to draw the NK on him? He could have done this after a mass claim to help draw kills from other town PRs, more so since he has no lynch left. By claiming vig and having no shots left he obviously could only end up confusing town more if he survived N3. Vig? Not impossible, but not all that likely.<br>\n<br>\nI would also stress that it is extremely important to note that RC's timing to claim is the major reason why he is unlikely to be vig. There are no real benefits to town, and possibly only detrimental effects. Also, DJ's point about town making scummy plays is WIFOM, townies can play anti-town. Scums can play town-like.

And if you are a doc its the best interest for town that you do not claim today and even claim at all. Also, why lynching RC is hard in the case of multi-ball its because it requires all 3 town to lynch RC, as well as the scum on SAS's team. Also, there's the problem of EPM notactively  participating in the game at all, and he's either a disinterested town who would probably throw his votes around, or a hard to read scum.

When he was in no danger of being lynched, no real reason to reveal his role and limits, no reason to give scum any more information other than slips. There was 8 players left with 1 scum date, town was in no danger of losing nor any visible disadvantage. And his reason is because he wants to draw the NK on him? He could have done this after a mass claim to help draw kills from other town PRs, more so since he has no lynch left. By claiming vig and having no shots left he obviously could only end up confusing town more if he survived N3. Vig? Not impossible, but not all that likely.</div></blockquote>\n\ni disagree. RC claim was before a lylo situation. granted you can make an argument for it both ways, but by pretending to be full vig instead of two shot was a nice way to draw the nk. still, if he is sk, there is no reason to lynch him at this point in time if we believe there may be two scum left. the number of kills also suggests he is who he says he is. unless scum wants to claim that they tried to shoot him and failed. there is no claimed protective role. <br>\n\n<blockquote><div><cite>ztife wrote:</cite>I would also stress that it is extremely important to note that RC's timing to claim is the major reason why he is unlikely to be vig.

The latter makes slightly more sense to me, just because the former setup option could mean a ridiculously short game, but 3 factions and a smaller scum team extends it a little bit. Not to mention RC's play is the worst out of everyone here that's not me. I don't believe his reasons for the quickhammer. The other thing that convinces me that RC has to be SK is that I've had a town read on just about every single other player in the game and I just don't think it's possible that there's two scum in my town reads, although I've been terribly wrong and not nearly present enough the whole game so it's entirely possible.

Tedious long walls of texts, I'll put a summary for those tl:dr and why its important to lynch RC today.<br>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>i disagree. RC claim was before a lylo situation. granted you can make an argument for it both ways, but by pretending to be full vig instead of two shot was a nice way to draw the nk. still, if he is sk, there is no reason to lynch him at this point in time if we believe there may be two scum left. <div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">the number of kills also suggests he is who he says he is</div>. unless scum wants to claim that they tried to shoot him and failed. there is no claimed protective role. \n</div></blockquote>\n\nNumber of kills does not support that he is vig. N1 and N3 has 1 kill, only N2 has 2 kills.<br>\nChances of aiming bacde as scum 1/9 (3 scums + 1 dead + 9 targets)<br>\nChances of aiming bacde as vig 1/12 (1 vig + 1 dead + 11 targets)<br>\n<br>\nThe chances of both scum and vig aiming bacde for N1 is actually less than <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF0000\">1%</div></div>. I don't remember bacde's play as being overly popular for a N1 kill. Since your theory of RC being vig seems to rely heavily on the fact there is only 1 town PR, there is no doc protect. <br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\"><div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Therefore, the number of kills suggests that it is likely RC is SK who might have shots left, or we have a unclaimed doc and he is scum. Probability wise in terms of kills, there's a 1% chance that RC was vig (1% chance that he and scum killed the same target)</div></div><br>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><blockquote><div><cite>ztife wrote:</cite><div style=\"display:inline;color:#00BF00\">As SK</div> with bulletproof, fake claiming vig gives an advantage because scums cannot lynch him, and scums cannot reveal themselves to expose him (even if they did town might not buy it). It is also possible that he has another shot (he has only shot once so far, or has more than 2 shots). Now that we have 6 players, likely roles are<br>\nSK, 2x SCUM, 3x TOWN<br>\n1. Town lynches scum, scum NK town, D4 starts with SK, SCUM, TOWN, TOWN. If he convinces town to lynch scum he will NK town and win the game. </div></blockquote>\n\ntown still has a chance. this is fear mongering.</div></blockquote>\nIn this case, if we lynch SK, scum NKs town and town loses.<br>\nIf we lynch scum, we need to count on the fact that SK has no shots left for town to win.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\"><div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">We have to lynch 2 scums in a row and hope that SK has no more shots left, and then lynch the SK.

I have also said that I believe SK has another shot (or more) and therefore this scenario guarantees a town loss.<br>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>two nights with only one kill does not suggest multi-ball. especially with an all vanilla town. this is the least likely scenario imo. town has already lost. so i will not explore this option.</div></blockquote>\n<div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF0000\">You can believe that vig/scum targetted the same player but not in a multi-ball? How strange. </div>This furthur proves that your posting is biased in favour to RC. If RC was scum (and that we have an unclaimed doc) or SK then the night kills would make so much more sense and is so much more likely. Scums/SK could have choosen not to make the kill (since if RC is vig and he has no reason to lie about his actions) or got their kills blocked/protected. This scenario is highly probable.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nAlso, your WIFOM discussion is precisely the thing that im taking out of context here. <div style=\"display:inline;color:#FF0000\">You can believe that RC controversial claim is pro-town and therefore he must be truly vig, yet you cannot believe that all his scummy play makes him scum/sk.</div> Yes, RC is scummy, and his claim helps him to win if he is SK/scum. That's all we are focused on. Therefore we must lynch him.<br>\n<br>\n\"But he could be vig and playing really bad!\" \"Lets flip a coin and decide!\" \"How about we just lynch someone else instead since its WIFOM and we can't decide?\" Nope, we're not doing that today.<br>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>^^ HORSESHIT. lynching RC guarantees town a loss in EVERY SCENARIO.</div></blockquote>\nNope. Lynching RC gives town a loss only if he is vig. And conveniently you have decided that since drawing the NK makes sense(but claiming to help him win as SK/SCUM doesn't make sense?!) THEREFORE RC MUST BE VIG LETS IGNORE EVERY OTHER POSSIBILITY.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nLastly, at this point im pretty sure you are scum. My last game with you you seem to be alot more logical and careful in the way you make your assumptions. Over here you have basically lurked much of D1 and D2, and your real active scum hunting begins late D3 and mostly today. You have also insist on RC being vig despite being presented options which you have not been able to disprove. If you are playing as town I would have expected you to make me elaborate my scenarios more, and question RC more on his credibility of being a vig. Instead, its all one-sided.<br>\nIf you are RC's buddy you're most likely to win if we dont lynch RC today, therefore you will do all you can to prevent bump+penguin+me+epm from trying to lynch RC. All you need is just to sway 1 player. If you are on the opposing scum team or RC is SK, you are probably doing all this and lynching RC in the end to score town points. <br>\n<br>\nIm pretty confident that penguin is town at this point, and I cannot decide between bump or epm for the last townie. It will be dependent if RC is SK or scum and I would have to re-read.  Obviously im town. There's your three.<br>\n<br>\nAlso, keep in mind that I have no 100% way of winning. I don't know the setup. I don't know if we have un-claimed doc or roleblocker or whatsoever. But there's still a chance to win.<br>\n<br>\nIf RC is SK and we don't lynch him, we lose. If RC is scum and we don't lynch him (or another other scum) we lose. (MIGHT still win if we count on scums cross killing, getting protected or kills blocked etc. if we get super lucky) <br>\n<br>\nUnless you believe RC is VIG AND this setup is 2-shot vig 3 scum 8 VTS, or you are his scum buddy =)", "time": "Tue May 28, 2013 11:04 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=26891&start=875", "forum": "53", "thread": "26891"}

If you're scum, it's not outside the realm of possibility that your team shot him Night One.  He might have refrained from killing last night, or he overlapped (the odds go down some significant amount at 7 people left.  Assume Mafia don't shoot RC since he was so scummy, if there are two of them they had four choices.  SK probably didn't want to help the town more; shot at towny looking person.  Even with it being totally random, the odds quadruple.  With it being less random, odds of overlap skyrocket.  Oh, and I think the previous odds only accounted for the fact that the Mafia and SK would shoot a specific same person.  Make the Mafia's target fixed, and suddenly the odds jump to 10%.  Here, with the Mafia's target fixed, the odds go to 17% and only improve if the SK eliminates correct scum reads.  Which, say what you will, RC did nail scum Night Two.)<br>\n<br>\nAhem.  My original point, if scum already took a shot at RC, they could figure they've used up his BP allotment.  A full BP SK in a 13p game with few if any PRs and only one other killing faction...possible, but unlikely.  So why try to lynch him?  You can just NK him and use this day to eliminate a townie, assuring LyLo if the SK shoots elsewhere and there's one of you left or an outright win with more than one Mafia surviving the night.<br>\n<br>\nI acknowledge that this is only one possible explanation, but given the fact that it is feasible, your defense of RC doesn't absolve you of being scum.  And your cheerleading of him earlier in the face of his scummy play looks like you're looking for an excuse not to find him worthy of a rope.", "time": "Wed May 29, 2013 5:44 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=26891&start=900", "forum": "53", "thread": "26891"}

If we are against a three-man scum team, even lynching the correct scum sends us into night 3-1-1, with the possibility of it being 1-1-1 come morning, which if RC is BP, leaves town screwed.

Which Mafia would almost certainly claim is the case.  Hitting town with a two-man team is the same scenario, except if RC kills Mafia we don't know for sure that all Mafia is dead.<br>\n<br>\nAt this point, I'm assuming one of you (Ztife) and DJ is scum.  I find it less odd that DJ didn't mention SAS than that SAS didn't mention you, given the way some of the early days went.  As far as scum hunting goes, you've both made your stances quite clear, and the longer things go on, the less I think I want to lynch either of you today.  If I'm around tomorrow and we're trying to find scum, there will be plenty of time to investigate then.  Or more likely at 3-1, move to no-lynch and hope the choice gets dumped on some other townie's shoulders.<br>\n<br>\nDJ, if RC is a 2-shot vig, we're screwed any way we go, since we're lynching him today or tomorrow.  A three-man scum team with a correct scum lynch today with RC as a vig out of shots has one scum left and one NK, but let's face it, we're all betting on RC being an SK and would lynch him as responsible for the single kill in that case.

Which Mafia would almost certainly claim is the case.  Hitting town with a two-man team is the same scenario, except if RC kills Mafia we don't know for sure that all Mafia is dead.<br>\n<br>\nAt this point, I'm assuming one of you (Ztife) and DJ is scum.  I find it less odd that DJ didn't mention SAS than that SAS didn't mention you, given the way some of the early days went.  As far as scum hunting goes, you've both made your stances quite clear, and the longer things go on, the less I think I want to lynch either of you today.  If I'm around tomorrow and we're trying to find scum, there will be plenty of time to investigate then.  Or more likely at 3-1, move to no-lynch and hope the choice gets dumped on some other townie's shoulders.<br>\n<br>\nDJ, if RC is a 2-shot vig, we're screwed any way we go, since we're lynching him today or tomorrow.  A three-man scum team with a correct scum lynch today with RC as a vig out of shots has one scum left and one NK, but let's face it, we're all betting on RC being an SK and would lynch him as responsible for the single kill in that case.

If its multi-ball and we lynch SAS's partner it means town loss. In the other scenario if we mislynch town instead of scum it would end up in the 1-1-1 D5. <br>\n<br>\nIn my other game with 3 scum + SK we had tracker and doc and neighbors. <div style=\"display:inline;text-decoration:underline\">Even though we lynched 3 scums in 4 days town <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">still loss</div></div>. If there's no town PR, dj claims that multi-ball is unlikely but 3scums + SK is possible. If only you would even see how paradoxical this statement is. I agree that in this setup we lose if we lynch SK, but fact is town loses <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">anyway</div>. In a tight situation like now where we cannot afford to mislynch we have to have the SK lynch, especially when we are so sure of it. If it was mult-ball even if we hit SAS's partner we would lose instantly. SK is third party, if SK is functional and scum wants SK dead then its the best interest for town to want SK dead as well. If scum wants SK alive then all the more town would need SK lynched because scum would only keep SK alive for anti-town purposes. So even if you think that me and dj are probably scum, think about why we have to lynch the SK today.", "time": "Sun Jun 02, 2013 9:14 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=26891&start=975", "forum": "53", "thread": "26891"}

The reason why the whole RC lynch was super scummy its because you changed your opinion last minute, where you have stated your stand on not lynching RC because he's vig/sk.

Therefore the only trigger for you to lynch RC was because of his self vote. <br>\n<br>\nWhat was DJ right about again? RC being vig.. meaning you lynched someone you thought vig?

Because if that's the case, im pretty sure I mentioned 2scum+sk more times than you did. I would do the quotes if anybody would bother to read.

He was honestly confused as to the set-up which led some reality to his posting, but ultimately, look at what he was trying to do. my acquiescence to the RC lynch was based on all of the things I stated. look at our post lynch reactions. look at the fact that ztife's main push for scumdj was that dj was partnered with scumRC. there is very little case to be made against dj as SAS partner. especially given all  of my actions yesterday when I could have simply lynched RC and shot bump or ztife to rid myself of one of my main opponents. we can wifom this to death. if its between ztife and myself the choice shouldn't be that tough. but ask away if you have questions.</div></blockquote>\n\nAgain, misrep me.

Explain what you understand of DJ's explaination/hammer. <br>\n<br>\nSomeone who says we should not lynch RC and goes hammering, if RC flips anti-town he gets town cred, if RC flips town he goes \"I told you so\" and gets town cred as well? Not sure what you are making of his \"explaination\" really, because town don't adjust their reasoning when scum hunting. Scums do, because they are finding ways to make townies look scummy or make themselves look town. One moment its not ok to lynch RC, another moment it is. <br>\n<br>\nYou and I know why we wanted the RC lynch. But why would DJ want RC lynch after all that bullshit he put up? Because RC self-voted? Does RC self-voting change any of his bullshit theories earlier? It doesn't.. because lynching the \"SK\" at this point would help DJ look more town.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nAlso, I never conclude that 2scum vs 11 town is impossible, I said that vig rc was pretty much impossible and sk should be lynched for us to know the setup.
