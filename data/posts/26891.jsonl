Are you trying to say that?<br><br>~P</div></blockquote><br>No, I'm simply saying that his wagon is unfounded and the people on it should place there vote more productively. Also, l-2 on a shite wagon? does that no raise an eyebrow?<br><br>We are, what 5 pages into the game? There are no certain town or certain cum reads. But cow is slightly towny at best to flat out null at worst in my opinion.<br><br>But, to the point of being defeatist... In my opinion this is a double edged sword. On one hand we have the fact that the scum MUST stay alive in order to win. There is a direct correlation between not getting lynched and winning the game. So from that standpoint cowbell is town.<br><br>But, if you look at it from another direction... it reads as null. Firstly scum knows that the town knows that they need to stay alive. Therefore, cow could be faking his defeatism in order to feign townieness. It is also worth noting that his wagon would have been a great opportunity to start a counter wagon on someone on his own wagon. He could have scumhunted more from his wagon. Naturally this is all wifom.<br><br>Conclusion: Too early to tell<br><br>@bcade, right now, it is too early for me to call out scum teams. Jesus, what do you expect? 100 posts in and have everyone nailed? Right, now instead of association tells are zero to none. Right now, go for general scum reads until we at least get some hard core buddying going on or a flip.<br><br><br><br>Also, how many fucking hydras are in this damn game?"}

That's just an additional reason. You've been quite quiet early game (which is rare for a hydra) and your recent activity consists of jokes of you being 'not dull' and 'super awkward'.

Certain hydras like to make fewer posts, and rather than post individually like crazy, the two players talk before making a post to begin with. Not saying that's the case, but it kind of makes your point moot. The has game barely started too and you're calling US quiet?

You've not really been stating a clear answer why you think it's scummy, while SAS has done otherwise.<br><br>I can't accept that because the reasoning is poor, and anybody can say \"Gut feeling this post is Town/Scum\". It seems like a get out of jail free card.<br><br>An acceptable answer would be something along the lines SAS posted. Pointing out what you found scummy about them. Not just saying \"It was gut\"<br><br>No, it seems like you are completely copying someone else's thoughts, because you only have a \"gut feeling\" case against me, and when someone actually has a reasonable case against me (although I do disagree with it), you say \"Yeah, I was thinking this all along\". Had you answered me with this before, maybe we wouldn't be here. It seems very scummy that you would take someone's reasoning and say \"I was thinking that all along\", especially since your only other case against me is \"gut feeling\"<br><br>No, the problem is, had you answered with that in the first place, before SAS's post, I wouldn't have found it scummy. It just seems that you're trying to use someone else's case against me, when you didn't point it out yourself initially. Also, as I've said, your reasoning was very poor, and now you're taking someone else's better reasoning, and using it as your own."}

A players actions should stand on their own merit. However, I am willing to concede that meta could be useful in order to show, without a doubt, that om's motivation for using such meta is only for his personal gain, instead of that of the town. So a question to om:<br><br>Why do you need to show us your meta when your actions should, under <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">all</span> circumstances, be enough to ascertain townieness on their own?<br><br>@ztife, I know I'm going to break a rule that I previously made by answer a question for om. But I believe that the purpose of his town meta i gain a sense of \"town authority\". That allows him to not worry about getting lynched himself and to push whatever lynch he wants with a group of people who will \"follow the leader\". His motivation could not possibly be to prove that he was town in and of itself, because no one was seriosuly questioning his townieness at the time."}

Still Town.</span><br>Red Dragon <span class=\"noboldsig\">Scumhunting well also, and his case on YOLO was very persuasive.</span><br>Secret Agent Sloth <span class=\"noboldsig\">His reasons for wanting me lynched were defendable, but they seemed very much valid to me. I looked at it from his perspective.</span><br>don_johnson <span class=\"noboldsig\">His play is too high risk for scum I believe. Still keep an eye on him though.</span><br>RadiantCowbells <span class=\"noboldsig\">Don't know what to think of his acceptance of the lynch, leaning more Town because of it, but he's in the null read area for activity.</span><br>penguin_alien <span class=\"noboldsig\">More activity crucially needed. His posts aren't bad though, just impossible to get a read off of.</span><br>Om of the Nom <span class=\"noboldsig\">A mixed bag very much. Seems to be townish in some posts, scummy in some others. I wouldn't call him scum yet though.</span><br>Cheery Dog <span class=\"noboldsig\">His play's just been very odd, and not very townish. Recently discovered hypocrisy through an ISO, he simply calls SAS and Om Town. I'm being accused of hypocrisy, and yet the accuser is also being hypocritical? Hmm. Why didn't you explain? I told you my reason.</span><br>Bacde <span class=\"noboldsig\">You know my case against Bacde. Moved down due to recent play.</span><br>evilpacman18 (for YOLO's play really, waiting for him to respond) <span class=\"noboldsig\">Red Dragon really managed to persuade me here. Pacman's play hasn't screamed Town either though.</span> <br>qwints <span class=\"noboldsig\">Please just ISO him. Moved up due to Bacde's behaviour.</span><br>SCUM<br><br>Taking a look at this wagon of me, I have a sinking feeling that at least one of those people on my wagon are scum, and it's either Bacde, Cheery or (less likely) Om at the moment.<br><br>Therefore, even though I can settle on a qwints lynch.<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: qwints</span><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Bacde</span>"}

Ztife\u2019s response is town. Fegelein\u2019s response is scummy. Pressure is there to get information, and there\u2019s definitely information from that. The last line in #62 is a good start; it doesn\u2019t sit right with me that he challenges Cowbell\u2019s pressure before acting like he\u2019s pressured.

I can see his thought process behind Bacde, and I can agree with him on the Fegelein wagon. However, I feel that the way the wagon started was what was bad about it, not whether he deserved votes or not. I\u2019d have a bigger townread on the wagon if it was made for the right reasons.<br><br><a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=4848199#p4848199\" class=\"postlink\">#76</a> \u2013 Cheery Dog \u2013 This is the scummiest post made so far.

While near the end of the feg wagon zitfe was becoming more and more convinced. Zitfe is interesting because he will lay a major role later... and the fact that he hasn't posted much of anything. From his iso I find that zitfe is more of a sheep rather than a herder.

You need 6 votes in 30 hours, and must switch your vote before school. Could you give me time that your classes start in UTC time? <br><br>So then we have the second vote for cheery come in by ank, at ~ 26  hours from deadline. Odd, especially considering that he said that feg get definite \"scum points in post #547, calls his town tell bullshit in the same post, and doesn't like his play in 579.

Depending on when school starts, you could be out of luck with that wagon switch thing.

From a wagon that needed only 3 votes to lynch 24 hours from deadline... a wagon from nothing lynched town.<br><br><br>So who is that mystery person? Well, in my honest opinion it has to be one of these:<br>Ankamius, penguin_alien, MrBump, or Ztife. There is no way that the feg wagon could have been derailed only by feg and town. Of the four, <br><br>MrBump doesn't seem like it, my personal view here. Others may disagree.<br><br>Ankamius has a decent probability, but he did adamantly call cheery scum and HE WAS ABLE TO CHANGE HIS VOTE if he needed to. With this being the case there was no reason for ank to not see where the wagon went. There was nothing to lose, all to gain. <br><br>Penguin has a very high chance of being scum. He basically came out and aid he was voting for a lost cause. But to be fair to penguin he did actually say that feg wasn't scum in his first post in game. Maybe he could have voted in time... who knows.<br><br>That leaves zitfe, which is where I personally think the blame for the wagon lies. No votes for cheery until it reached 4v4. only one page before, when the cheery wagon was just starting, zitfe was warming up to the feg wagon. Cheery was far from his posts. BUT MAN RIGHT WHEN IT HIT TE TIPPING POINT. Boom muda fucka. Gonna vote that. Zitfe derailed the wagon. Zitfe lynched town. Zitfe was condemned by cheery dog (for what ever it is worth). Zitfe is the third scum<br><br>but for now...<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">vote: feg</span><br>Unfinished business that MUST be taken care of."}

So I'm with Bump on this one, Feg please explain why it's particularly bad.<br><br>RD's attacks on me in his wall post basically revolve around me trying to derail the Feg wagon (who I claimed was a townread at that time). Firstly, that relies on Feg being scum, because if Feg is town, me trying to derail it wouldn't make sense. Secondly, I wasn't here when the Cheery wagon grew massively, so I can't really have been the main focal point between the derailment of the Feg wagon and the growth of the Cheery wagon. I had openly called Cheery town and I had openly called Feg town. Above all I had openly claimed that my intentions were just to get a lynch before the deadline hit. My last ditch effort to try and get a wagon on a top scumread (MrBump) was just a hopeful pastime which I would have been happy if it had succeeded, but it succeeding was not entirely necessary for any further progression.<br>RD how strongly would you think I'm scum if Feg flips town? You do have some merit in that case if Feg flips scum, sure I'll admit that, but I don't really see how that makes me scum if Feg's town.<br><br>Feg isn't logically a scumread for me, but I get bad gut feelings from his posts and unless he does something super scummy my read's probably gonna stay that way. At this stage I'd only really lynch him for deadline reasons (but it's not like that can't change).<br><br>I'm not opposed to a Ztife wagon tbh, I've never really given a read on him but he's never really swayed my opinion either way. His place on the Cheery wagon is too convenient, other than that I don't really have much on him. Not a prime suspect but still weary.<br><br>Honestly I'm getting bad feelings from SAS still. They're way too lurky considering they're a hydra. I know Venmar posts a fair bit normally and I don't want him to have the chance to lurk to victory if he's scum. Pressure on them will come soon hopefully.<br><br>Bump was the 4th vote on Cheery, when the Cheery lynch still wasn't inevitable and Feg was the leading wagon. I don't like this but I can't ignore the fact that Bump had consistently had Feg as a townread (however consistency isn't always a good thing so it's not like he's town for that).<br><br>Penguin_Alien was the 3rd vote and she hopped on with a pretty shit reason that was basically a parrot. Do not like this either.<br><br>Don and RD are pretty much town. Cowbells is town. evilpacman is still not a bad choice for a lynch today and Ank is likely town too."}

In the essence of it at that point cherry dog was not doing much of scum hunting, or anything in particular actually. The convenient sheeping on feg's wagon was a good example of how scums jump on a wagon without a good case near deadline. Did he convince me that he thought feg was scummy? No. Did he feel like he wants to talk about it? No.<br><br>Its easy to crap out statements like \"there must be a scum on the mislynch wagon\" when we're not actually looking at the scum hunting.<br>While we can argue about whether cherry dog seems scummy or not at that point, you must agree that I was one of the first few players who actually mentioned and draw attention to him. The only reason I didn't vote for him then its because I was still pushing for a YOLO lynch whom I think was actual scum then (re-reads needed from D1 N1 results which I've yet to do).<br><br>Feg was not a strong lynch as I had mentioned, and at the 4/4 feg/cherry point it seems that a cherry lynch was more likely, because most people voting for feg was in it to prevent a NL (or so I assumed). That includes you, which..<br><br><a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=4901715#p4901715\" class=\"postlink\">#549</a> you mentioned that feg is null, or nullish or whatever. But suddenly he jumped to scummy in your recent post. <span class=\"noboldsig\">That inconsistancy is glaring at me.</span> You also voted for him without any strong explainations.<br><br>If feg was scum, then your theory might hold strong and you might have found the scum team. But what the fuck are you going to do if feg flips town? What do you think happened between the feg/CD wagon in D1? Have you considered the possibility that feg and cherry are both town? It would have been easy for scums to sit back and do nothing, because either way it would have landed a mislynch. With this point in mind its easy to see why it is also possible that the scum team would not want to push any of the wagons. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">And therefore the key here in your theory is why feg is scummy.</span><br><br>Points about om is strong, especially the contradictory switch of votes.

The fact that feg \"led\" a wagon? Lets get a couple of things straight over here.<br><br>Anybody who is getting lynched should be trying to get someone else. That's normal behaviour, unless we're talking about some sort of gambit. Town does that, scum does that. Having a crapass defeatist attitute like RC did in the first few couple of pages only serves to show how anti-town that is. Even if you are getting lynched, you generate discussions for scums to flip on consistancy. Therefore the fact that Feg has voted on someone else before his wagon died is WIFOM on his alignment.<br><br>That replacing out is a crap move, not too sure what I think about that.<br><br>I could be sold if you could actually come up with a proper case. The idea of an NL would have been ideal for scum as well. The fact that scums would wanna derail feg's wagon and also risk exposure voting for CD just seems farfetched to me. I should probably read and comment alot more about the wagon on CD, but the fact that it was close to deadline makes the cases weak. We have to choose between 2 reads evens if we think they are weak just to prevent an NL, town is as likely to have weak votes as scums.

Most people voting for feg was trying to go for an easy lynch or prevent an NL.<br><br>How exactly did the cherry wagon change your read on feg? You have failed to explain this repeatedly. What im trying to tell you is, your case is bad, not only you did not try to reinforce your case but your insisting on your sub-par scum hunting which fails to show any logic. You are also giving players like DJ with and RC with no proper explaination about their votes or whatsoever to get away with sheeping votes on Feg. Lynch him because he didn't get lynch D1? What a bunch of crap logic.<br><br>And just to show how wifom your logic is, if CD flipped scum does it mean that feg is town? No.<br><br>Your dissection of CD's wagon, think about how scum could be lying the midst of lurkers like SAS, evil, akam, they practically have almost little to nothing in the posts. If we lynch feg now, IF he had turns out to be town, we'll be left with nothing to start D3 with. Your gambit that all 3 scum would be on CD's wagon is misleading, the lack of wagoning in D1 shows that scums are just lying around and letting town rot by itself at the rate we're going. There issin't even any pressure for the lurkers to stop lurking. If you have town interest in mind, make a better case and convince people to start voting for feg. Otherwise, take a look at the lurkers and start pressure voting. IIRC you mentioned that YOLO slot was scummy, and evil did practically nothing after he replaced. This is a good place to start getting more out of the un-noticed players. players."}

Otherwise we would surely lose. And even if you are scum (1 team or multi-ball SAS team) you will want RC lynched. The only reason you would not want RC to be lynched today is because you are his scum buddy, or you believe he's truly vig.<br><br>Also my personal opinions are that this is most likely a multi-ball, and we probably have a PR of doc. And if you are a doc its the best interest for town that you do not claim today and even claim at all. Also, why lynching RC is hard in the case of multi-ball its because it requires all 3 town to lynch RC, as well as the scum on SAS's team. Also, there's the problem of EPM notactively  participating in the game at all, and he's either a disinterested town who would probably throw his votes around, or a hard to read scum. Either possibilities is just bad for us. RC just has to be lynched today."}

When he was in no danger of being lynched, no real reason to reveal his role and limits, no reason to give scum any more information other than slips. There was 8 players left with 1 scum date, town was in no danger of losing nor any visible disadvantage. And his reason is because he wants to draw the NK on him? He could have done this after a mass claim to help draw kills from other town PRs, more so since he has no lynch left. By claiming vig and having no shots left he obviously could only end up confusing town more if he survived N3. Vig? Not impossible, but not all that likely.</div></blockquote><br><br>i disagree. RC claim was before a lylo situation. granted you can make an argument for it both ways, but by pretending to be full vig instead of two shot was a nice way to draw the nk. still, if he is sk, there is no reason to lynch him at this point in time if we believe there may be two scum left. the number of kills also suggests he is who he says he is. unless scum wants to claim that they tried to shoot him and failed. there is no claimed protective role. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>ztife wrote:</cite>I would also stress that it is extremely important to note that RC's timing to claim is the major reason why he is unlikely to be vig. There are no real benefits to town, and possibly only detrimental effects. Also, DJ's point about town making scummy plays is WIFOM, townies can play anti-town. Scums can play town-like. It doesn't change anything, and <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">the focus is not on that but on his motivations to claim at start of D3</span> (which I have stressed repeatedly)</div></blockquote><br><br>you are making my point exactly. your initial big reason for pushing a lynch on RC is because of his \"scum-play.\" now you are adding \"timing of his claim\". the \"scum play\" is wifom. vig has every reason to act scummy and avoid being nk'd. timing of his claim just doesn't stand up to me. and AGAIN, if he is sk, as a townie, i would be more inclined to lynch scum because scum is part of a team and we have no idea how large that team may be. SK = 1. easily dealt with later on. remaining scum = 1 OR 2. meaning if we don't lynch SCUM today then we quite possibly lose. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>ztife wrote:</cite><span style=\"color: #00BF00\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">As SK</span></span> with bulletproof, fake claiming vig gives an advantage because scums cannot lynch him, and scums cannot reveal themselves to expose him (even if they did town might not buy it).

The latter makes slightly more sense to me, just because the former setup option could mean a ridiculously short game, but 3 factions and a smaller scum team extends it a little bit. Not to mention RC's play is the worst out of everyone here that's not me. I don't believe his reasons for the quickhammer. The other thing that convinces me that RC has to be SK is that I've had a town read on just about every single other player in the game and I just don't think it's possible that there's two scum in my town reads, although I've been terribly wrong and not nearly present enough the whole game so it's entirely possible. Penguin is the one person I was kinda null on who's still left so my first guess is that he's scum.

My last game with you you seem to be alot more logical and careful in the way you make your assumptions.

You have also insist on RC being vig despite being presented options which you have not been able to disprove.

If RC is scum and we don't lynch him (or another other scum) we lose.

NO FUCKING WAY. optimal scum play here is to lynch the sk.</div></blockquote><br><br>Let's accept that unless RC has a really good answer for why he made himself look super-scummy right before night phase, he wasn't trying to draw the kill as a used up townie and so he's the SK.  If you're scum, it's not outside the realm of possibility that your team shot him Night One.  He might have refrained from killing last night, or he overlapped (the odds go down some significant amount at 7 people left.  Assume Mafia don't shoot RC since he was so scummy, if there are two of them they had four choices.  SK probably didn't want to help the town more; shot at towny looking person.  Even with it being totally random, the odds quadruple.  With it being less random, odds of overlap skyrocket.  Oh, and I think the previous odds only accounted for the fact that the Mafia and SK would shoot a specific same person.  Make the Mafia's target fixed, and suddenly the odds jump to 10%.  Here, with the Mafia's target fixed, the odds go to 17% and only improve if the SK eliminates correct scum reads.  Which, say what you will, RC did nail scum Night Two.)<br><br>Ahem.  My original point, if scum already took a shot at RC, they could figure they've used up his BP allotment.  A full BP SK in a 13p game with few if any PRs and only one other killing faction...possible, but unlikely.  So why try to lynch him?  You can just NK him and use this day to eliminate a townie, assuring LyLo if the SK shoots elsewhere and there's one of you left or an outright win with more than one Mafia surviving the night.<br><br>I acknowledge that this is only one possible explanation, but given the fact that it is feasible, your defense of RC doesn't absolve you of being scum.  And your cheerleading of him earlier in the face of his scummy play looks like you're looking for an excuse not to find him worthy of a rope."}

You are right, because there is no 100% way of determining roles and there is always a small catch in any theory.

This implies heavily to me that you are scum buddies with RC.<br><br>I could make a case from previous days about DJ, but quite frankly im too lazy to ATM. As I have said repeatedly RC's flip is key to determining the setup and finding the remaining scum and as much as possible, im opposed keeping SK alive because there could be 2 NKs, and im opposed to lynching SAS's partner in terms of multi-ball. Thus EPM (my highest suspect) will be safe for today. As paradoxical as it may sound, lynching SK gives us the highest chance of winning, UNLESS YOU STILL BELIEVE THAT ITS 3SCUM + SK OR RC IS A VIG."}

In the other scenario if we mislynch town instead of scum it would end up in the 1-1-1 D5. <br><br>In my other game with 3 scum + SK we had tracker and doc and neighbors. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Even though we lynched 3 scums in 4 days town <span style=\"font-style: italic\">still loss</span></span>. If there's no town PR, dj claims that multi-ball is unlikely but 3scums + SK is possible. If only you would even see how paradoxical this statement is. I agree that in this setup we lose if we lynch SK, but fact is town loses <span style=\"font-style: italic\">anyway</span>. In a tight situation like now where we cannot afford to mislynch we have to have the SK lynch, especially when we are so sure of it. If it was mult-ball even if we hit SAS's partner we would lose instantly. SK is third party, if SK is functional and scum wants SK dead then its the best interest for town to want SK dead as well. If scum wants SK alive then all the more town would need SK lynched because scum would only keep SK alive for anti-town purposes. So even if you think that me and dj are probably scum, think about why we have to lynch the SK today."}

Ztife was arguing from the standpoint of being the lone scum left behind by SAS. He was honestly confused as to the set-up which led some reality to his posting, but ultimately, look at what he was trying to do. my acquiescence to the RC lynch was based on all of the things I stated. look at our post lynch reactions. look at the fact that ztife's main push for scumdj was that dj was partnered with scumRC. there is very little case to be made against dj as SAS partner. especially given all  of my actions yesterday when I could have simply lynched RC and shot bump or ztife to rid myself of one of my main opponents. we can wifom this to death. if its between ztife and myself the choice shouldn't be that tough. but ask away if you have questions."}

I can't lynch you on my own. and no one was supportive of it yesterday. considering I lynched the guy that YOU wanted to lynch from the get-go, I honestly don't see the problem for you. in your eyes, I should prpobably be clear at this point. I think your best move would have been to nk obvtownpenguin and go after epm. but then I would have called you on that as well. so whatevz.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>ztife wrote:</cite> In light of your scum hunting for D4 (which is literally just defending RC and accusing me in essence) you hammered instead of pushing my wagon (whom you thought scum).</div></blockquote><br><br>I pushed your wagon all day. I only hammered after RC failed hard in answering questions and self voted. also after discussing things with bump and working them out in my own head. which is all clearly documented in my posts.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>ztife wrote:</cite> And unless im clearly mistaken you are ditching your \"scum over SK\" because it was going to be an easy hammer. So, try again scum. Maybe you can come up with a better reason.</div></blockquote><br><br>wonderful theory. but why in the hell would scumdj have gone through all that trouble? you are missing the most important element here... motive. you need a majority to lynch, and the majority was leaning towards RC. I can only fight for what I believe for so long. we can wifom it all day, but I can only hope that people use common sense today and realize that...<br><br>dj was fucking right.</div></blockquote><br><br><br>Penguin's case? Your case was.. Ztife is pushing the RC lynch and therefore he must be scum, which ironically you hammer yourself. Or so it seems D4. Which part of me abandon common sense regarding setup? I listed all possible setups, I have also mentioned that this is one of the likely setups <blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>Precisely, multi-ball with a doc(fire and ice setup) and sk + 2 scum + 10 VTs are more possible setups since they are balanced, and in these cases lynching RC is priority to winning.</div></blockquote><br><br>Again, couple of misreps.<br>1. I listed all setups. I have also mentioned (quoted) the likely ones. Where was my abandonment of common sense again? Please.. you are just bringing it into wifom. Im not even sure you understand the meaning of possibility and likely at this point.<br>2. I have consistency in my posts. Even if we redo D4 again, I would probably still lynch RC. Fact is RC play was anti-town like and it was to me unlikely he was vig.<br>3. I agree that in a multi-ball or if RC was an SK he has to be lynched. Not sure how this makes me scum instead of town, please explain.<br>4. I agree that I pushed RC to be lynched, and I agree that my read about him not being vig was wrong.<br><br>You have been pushing my wagon for all sorts of wrong reasons, and that's why the wagon did not gain traction. Do you even realise? I'm not scum, and there's no clear reason/motivation why I should would be pushing RC wagon this hard if I'm scum. You go on about high and loftly theories about how scum should fear sk and all that stuff but end of the day, you can't give literal examples why if it is a lone scum he has to push the wagon like I did instead of just lurking more.<br><br>Town make wrong lynches, town makes wrong pushes, simply because they don't know alignment. Reads are still reads. In fact, wrong reads are mostly a null-townish read. Scums are afraid to give strong reads or read-list because it could make them look scummy. If they push too many wrong wagons it will draw attention to them. Scums mostly just want to lie low and go with popular opinion to get lynches.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=4970197#p4970197\" class=\"postlink\">post 799</a>, don_johnson wrote:</cite>bottom page 5. red dragon and mr. bumps defense of SAS is noted.

Ztife was arguing from the standpoint of being the lone scum left behind by SAS. He was honestly confused as to the set-up which led some reality to his posting, but ultimately, look at what he was trying to do. my acquiescence to the RC lynch was based on all of the things I stated. look at our post lynch reactions. look at the fact that ztife's main push for scumdj was that dj was partnered with scumRC. there is very little case to be made against dj as SAS partner. especially given all  of my actions yesterday when I could have simply lynched RC and shot bump or ztife to rid myself of one of my main opponents. we can wifom this to death. if its between ztife and myself the choice shouldn't be that tough. but ask away if you have questions.</div></blockquote><br><br>Again, misrep me.

Your reasons for RC lynch is hard to elaborate because simply it contradicts everything you have said D4. Again, discussions with bump? All I saw was a 2-liner and you hammered.

I came around to it after much discussion. its not like I was just like \"herp derp, hammer.\" your case is entirely inconsistent with what you were saying yesterday. my case on you is still the same. you pushed the lynch towards the sk/vig spouting contradictory statistics and claiming that it was somehow in towns best interest, when, in fact, there was only ONE SINGLE scenario where it was the optimal lynch(that being multi-ball). in the 3p/sk/town scenario it would be a death knell, and in the MOST LIKELY scenario 2p/sk/town it was a gamble. in no way a priority. best case is that it didn't matter which anti-town was lynched. so me hammering what we all seemed to agree was a guy who was flipping sk in a 2pscum set-up is not contradictory to anything I preached other than me wanting us to be cautious and lynch the scum first. the scum being the guy who was doing everything in his power to convince us the WE HAD TO LYNCH THE SK pushing his arguments based on the LEAST LIKELY SCENARIO.<br><br>this is exhausting.<br><br>p-edit: <blockquote><div><cite>ztife wrote:</cite>Me pushing RC lynch is scummy, you hammering issin't.

Not sure what you are making of his \"explaination\" really, because town don't adjust their reasoning when scum hunting.

One moment its not ok to lynch RC, another moment it is. <br><br>You and I know why we wanted the RC lynch. But why would DJ want RC lynch after all that bullshit he put up? Because RC self-voted?
