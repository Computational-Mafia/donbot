This should go without saying: Do not talk about ongoing games. Bad form, Hook.<br>\n7. Only the mafia faction are permitted to discuss this game outside the game thread.<br>\n8. The mafia factional topic will only be available for discussion during night phase.<br>\n9. Do not edit or delete posts, if you have moderation powers. Very bad form, Hook.<br>\n10. Do not directly quote role PMs, mod PMs, private topics or other out-of-game stuff.<br>\n11. Do not reveal players' alt accounts, if you know their mains. Extremely bad form.<br>\n<div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">12.

You quoted the questions I asked you in post 125.<br>\n<br>\nI call BS on the plausible deniability angle you are pushing cause nobody should ever take my own word for it and my ability is easily searchable by looking at my past games. To save you some time  I can tell you what you'd find if you did that. The game I played with nacho (just basing off memory) that's the game where I was under pressure late game and I was able to keep focused and scum gave up and admitted defeat. That explains why nacho probably thinks I'm a good player cause I basically won that game. You'll also find 2 games where I claimed prematurely day 1 and ended up hurting town in both games, II think town lost both those games also and I never got to use my roles. The other games don't really stand out in my mind so I'd have to do skim.those again. <br>\n<br>\nI don't see why me being honest about my ability bothers anyone, have I once tried to use that as an excuse? No, would I expect people to let me get away with it if I tried? Absolutely not. So you are suspicious of me for a null issue. Why not find something actually scummy?  there's people who have done things that fit that criteria. Like a person lying about another person when the evidence is clearly visible to say otherwise. Or a player who accused another player of something based of an assumption rather than taking the time to find out the actual reasons for their vote?<br>\n<br>\nIf you are town, do better.

It may be a little inappropriate coming so late in the game, but first, a few pleasantries! Skip over to the third paragraph/after the meta-links if you're looking for thoughts and content.<br>\n<br>\nHi Bellaphant! Good to be playing with you again. And hi to Nachomamma8 and Thor665! You don't know me, but I've been lurkreading Mafiascum games for a bit and read many of the completed past games. You guys are like legends to me, and I'm really excited to be able to play and learn from you two in this game! As a quick introduction also, I'm a newbie who's been reading and recently decided to start playing, have one completed newbie under my belt and this is my first non-newbie game. If you'd like to meta me from my previous game (VT) here's a link to the game and one to the dead thread with many of my thought processes:<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=11&amp;t=62773&amp;start=375\" class=\"postlink\">Game</a><br>\n<a href=\"http://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=94&amp;t=62915\" class=\"postlink\">Dead Thread</a> <br>\n<br>\nAnyway, here's my thoughts on reading through the game. It'd be rather brief as I'm a little pressed for time, will address any concerns or questions as much as I can though! davesaz looks townie to me so far from his posting, and I'm okay with Woody and Thor665 too. Nacho feels alright to me though I'm not too sure so far.<br>\n<br>\nThere's a couple of things that have caught my attention, and I have questions for a few people.<br>\n<br>\n@Ciara24, I dislike your entire back-and-forth discussion with Thor665 and the feel of the rest of your posts. It would be mostly a gut read, but one thing stood out to me: the part where you state his vote is a reaction test on you and proceed to try to make little of it (in my eyes) or devalue it.<br>\n<br>\nI can't seem to find any pro-town value in this - <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">Ciara, could you explain to me why you found it important to point out that Thor665's vote on you was a reaction test?</div><br>\n<br>\nSecondly,<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><div><cite>KarmicGuide wrote:</cite><blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7207552#p7207552\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7207552#p7207552\" data-post-id=\"7207552\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 117</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=12326\">Thor665</a> wrote:</cite>Let's lynch Ciara - her answers feel wonky to me and not like she's trying to assess me, but rather toss some dirt on me.

She just acts like she's been made aware of something and moves on and does nothing else.<br>\n<br>\nThe train is leaving the tracks, hop on quick.</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nI like the idea of day 1 Ciara lynch. IRL, I can respect putting college before mafia, and if that's what's going on, that's what's going on. But in the context of mafia, Ciara has felt lurky, and I agree that the scumhunting from her has been weak.<br>\n<br>\nI'll sheep your vote. Let the pressure begin!<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official unvote.\">UNVOTE: WoodyWoodpecker</span> I went and read a town game of yours last night, and this is basically how you played that game, too... you seem very agitated to me, but who knows what that means. I still would not be adverse to lynching you today. You've interacted with a lot of people, and you flipping scum would practically be game over.<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Ciara</span></div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nThis post. I dislike it very much. It feels very opportunistic to me, and pushing lurking as a reason for voting is rather weak. You also point out that you are sheeping, but yet find it important to put another reason for sheeping - lurking. <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">KarmicGuide, why not vote me (who hasn't posted at all), eventi (who's posted barely anything), Radja or even Nacho (who hasn't posted in a long while) for \"lurking\"? I also dislike your initial interactions with Woody. Lynching him because him flipping scum would practically be game over? Why, do you think he's formed many associative tells with others and implicated the scumteam? Who do you think is scum then if he flips scum? </div><br>\n<br>\nI think you're just setting up reasons to switch to a Woody lynch should your chosen wagon not pan out. <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: KarmicGuide</span></div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nXD I didn't vote you for lurking because I literally forgot you existed. I remember someone asked for a Leave of Absence for memorial day, though I suppose that's Frogger, not you.<br>\n<br>\nThanks for pointing out to me that you haven't been playing, I guess?<br>\n<br>\nVoting people who are totally just not playing isn't fun, anyway. Being totally MIA is different from actively lurking. If you kill someone who was barely playing on D1, and they flip VT, you have nothing to go on during D2. One of the biggest flaws in peoples' mafia games is mistaking laziness for scumminess. <br>\n<br>\nCiara seems like she's here and reading, but not doing specially great scumhunting. That (and also sheeping Thor, I thought that was implicit) is why I'm voting Ciara.<br>\n<br>\nThe Woody wagon (god, even the name is perfect - like those old wood-paneled station wagons? Did Woody pick his name for this pun? If so, much respect) still a good wagon. Reading his last completed town game did give me a lot of information. He was also pretty aggressive in that game, though his posts seemed to be more earnest scumhunting. His posts in this game, some of his posts have felt like a pretense of activity to me. What Thor said about Ciara \"attacking, not scumhunting\" applies to Woody as well.<br>\n<br>\nI am totally fine with a D1 Woody lynch. I just didn't want to spend all D1 tunneling the same person. I've made my case against Woody. His counter-argument has been that I'm wrong, humorless, and can't read, so I was getting pretty tired of that. Even if Woody flips VT, I stand by him as a good lynch candidate. He's interacted with a lot of people, and offers good D2 info on Nacho, Gramr, pistachi0n, and Bellaphant.<br>\n<br>\nTL;DR - I'm sheeping Thor, but it's because I agree with him, not blindly sheeping. Fine with Ciara or Woody lynch.

Woody strikes me as Town, mainly because he is actively scumhunting and propelling the discussion forward without super aggressive tunnelling.  That being said, I wouldn't call Karmic's \"immediate unvote\" argument lying.  At best it's a misunderstanding; at worst it's trying to see what accusations stick.

I kind of don't buy any of that. At the very least, it's flip-floppy.<br>\n<br>\nTo further expound on this... if you're scumhinting, you'd share your opinion of him, one way or the other. If you're hunting for Town PR's, however, and think Nacho is something, that would explain the \"yes\" with no follow up.<br>\n<br>\n4.) The more I read over this game, it's a lot of you saying \"I like this\" and \"I don't like this.\" When you do explain yourself, you do a reasonably good job, but those explanations are few and far between, and peppered with character assassination.</div></blockquote><br>\nCiara wasn't contributing enough to town? That's a big change in things from lurking and lol at the time ciara had a decent amount of posts. So that isn't really even a reason. Your stretching more than a gym instructor in yoga pants. It feels liek you were just trying to find a reason why to place your vote on the wagon.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n1.Well it was a serious vote coming out of rvs and I wanted some pressure on that slot as I didn't understand why people (thor and nacho) were instantly town reading it and I found that bit really quirky as I found newbie scum trying to do this before. Once the game progressed I felt better about the slot.<br>\n<br>\n2.Town shouldn't read walls on page 2 and 3 when there's pretty much nothing to go but rvs who the fuck makes walls out of rvs posts and a question about why did you vote me. I could pretty much say what thor was saying in one easy to read paragraph which I did. I know thor he makes a novel out of a page and thankfully he did cut down on the walls a bit so that makes me happy.<br>\n<br>\n3. I was going to answer thors question anyway so me fucking around with thor a bit is all in good fun for me.You don't fucking know what I lost in that game. I lost a friend who never talks to me anymore and pretty much ignored any attempt to patch things up with her after that game. That game was a pretty emotional game and nacho can attest to that. Also you accusing me of role hunting which is almost a big of stretch as your lurker thing. your really reaching for this.<br>\n<br>\n4.) I have trouble with words sometimes but I eventually do get it right. But I have pretty much explained everything I have said and like you have said I have done a pretty good job. Also saying that i use character Assassination as to undermine my the fact my points are pretty valid is pretty shit lol. I can be extremely snarky as town or scum so me making snide remarks about someone (I try to keep them tame and about in game content only so i don't get banned again) is pretty bad.<br>\n<br>\nSeriously I think your inexperienced with scum. Throwing stuff out which doesn't make sense if you look at it a little closer. Throwing wild accusation like his role hunting and trying to tell his scum team he thinks nacho is a role through I tend to role hunt as town as well which I can provide examples for but I wasn't role hunting here ;/ and finally changing oh she's lurking into oh she hasn't produced much content is very different and both are very wrong.<br>\n<br>\nSo what we have you doing here is Backtracking,mudthrowing,reaching,Finding a excuse to jump on the lead wagon there's a plethora of reasons why you are scum.", "time": "Sun Sep 13, 2015 3:33 pm", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=63235&start=250", "forum": "53", "thread": "63235"}

I think this is the most logical approach you can take to early game, and thus, while I don't consider his argument against Woody to be particularly strong, I do think that the approach makes sense and I don't mind the reaching argument here as a result. <br>\n<br>\nThe bottom paragraph about what he thinks Woody is doing here would be a surprisingly deep thought process for scum at this point in the game; instead of focusing heavily on surface-level interactions as scum do oh so often, he's explaining what he thinks Woody's mindset is at this point in time and why he is making the posts he's making as scum. The assertions also aren't exactly unsupported; I think saying that Woody started the game as a \"carefree jokester\" and then took a darker tone when pressured is completely accurate, although I don't think it means the same thing that Karmic thinks it does.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7208501#p7208501\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7208501#p7208501\" data-post-id=\"7208501\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 142</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=19631\">KarmicGuide</a> wrote:</cite>Ciara seems like she's here and reading, but not doing specially great scumhunting.

Maybe replace out soon, if you aren't up to doing more than prod-dodging.<br>\n<br>\nGarmr = IDK, I'm conflicted.

That leaves Ciara.<br>\n<br>\nSo no, I can't point to much of Ciara's content and say \"that's the scumslip, that's the lie.\" Those posts don't exist, because Ciara has stayed clear of this thread since the wagon on her started. Maybe she's just busy, but even when she was here, she always seemed afraid to post confident opinions.<br>\n<br>\nIt's not an airtight wagon, no. It's a gutread, plus some supporting evidence.

Did someone mention Thor likes to defend his buddies as scum? Garmr was a heavy busser in the last game I played with him where he was scum. I don't see him so strongly defending his buddy to the extent he defended Ciara. So I'm ruling these two out for now as partners.

I really enjoy how you are taking my posts out of context - especially on escalating my views on Ciara wagon into defending Ciara. Really, really do. I also enjoy how everyone is rehashing my case on pista and using it to attack him, but presenting it as new evidence that they are discovering on their own. Did any of you even bother reading my case? <br>\n<br>\nSilverwolf, you list my <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7232663#p7232663\">434</a> as hopping on Pista and not liking pista's reasons for voting and use it to justify me as avoiding the Ciara wagon and defending her, and trying to get a different wagon. In that post, I've posted an entire case complete with lovely quotes on why I feel pistachi0n is scummy and worth looking into - points which all of you seem to agree with. I also a soft hammer/vote intent in the last line - that I'm happy to hop onto any of the other wagons if there's a danger of nolynch, and that Ciara is 1 away from lynch (with 3 hammer intents to boot on her - unstated by me in the post though) - I'm happy to come back and hammer her if everyone else disappears before deadline. How is stating this defending her? Is this scum repeating a lie until it becomes truth? Or did you just not read my post? <br>\n<br>\nAlso, right above, you quote Gimlear's points on pista, then below you do a quick summary of his actions and the reasons for you voting him. BOTH of these - Gimlear's points, and most of your points on pista, have long been stated in my <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7232663#p7232663\">434</a>. Yet, both of you, and pretty much the rest of the playerbase, INCLUDING pistachi0n himself, have been ignoring my case and are instead trying to paint me as scummy, but yet reuse the same points to attack pistachi0n. Again, have you even read my post before using it to accuse me? This is rubbish. I'm happy with you and many people putting suspicion on me for lack of activity, for I did lurk and flake and have rightfully earned that suspicion. Even pushing the Karmic wagon - that was a veiled prod dodge and also a poke to see what reactions I'd get (spoiler alert: I flaked after that, so I never read any of it). But defending Ciara? Avoiding her wagon? That's nonsense. <br>\n<br>\nIn other news, especially in the light of yesterday's flip and pistachi0n not addressing any points on him, I'm happy to <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: pistachi0n</span>.

A bit behind on reading and I'm tired and about to go to sleep. The rolecop claim by pistach has me raising my eyebrows, but her carelessness in doing so at L-3 on your provocation (when she's actually at L-3) actually lines up with her actions and makes it more believable that she didn't check properly and did genuinely believe she should claim. Also that claim is a rather weird one - rolecop with a rolecop on another rolecop seems too weird to be a fakeclaim and an odd gambit to make. Question is, is pistach town? Or is she just careless scum?<br>\n<br>\nSilverwolf I'm starting to dislike now because of her blatant mis-repping of my day 1 play, and sheeping the things I've said (with added clarity from the Day 1 flip) to vote pistach but yet turning around and using those same reasons to accuse me of defending Ciara and avoiding a wagon. <br>\nIt feels to me that that may be stretching a bit to create scumreads as scum who can't seem to find things to push. Waiting for her to post again and also respond to pistach's rolecop on her, am considering moving my vote to her. Probably warrants an <div style=\"display:inline;font-weight:bold\">FoS</div>.<br>\n<br>\nOf course, it doesn't quite make much sense for both to be Mafia, this would be a seriously weird WIFOMMY bussing gambit, especially with their Roleblocker dead.  Also realising that pistach's role claim (early one too) could be a calculated one to disguise a vote back on Silverwolf as with reason rather than an OMGUS (don't know how sound this reasoning is, feel free to tell me it's stupid if it is.) But the nice thing is, if they are both really rolecops, pistach has locked herself in - if we choose to lynch Silverwolf and she flips Town or anything but rolecop, we can lynch pistach and most likely hit scum. If Silverwolf flips scum role cop, pistach probably eats the Nightkill (as Radja should be under whoever's protective role) and we can direct her - and if she lives too long, she may be bussing scum and we can lynch her. Does this make sense, and is this why you are happy?<br>\n<br>\nI'm a little more unsure on pistach now, but I won't unvote first before Silverwolf posts, as I doubt there are more than 2 scum left in this game, making it rather unlikely that she will be quickhammered.", "time": "Thu Sep 24, 2015 4:51 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=63235&start=525", "forum": "53", "thread": "63235"}

For one, you always seem to be acting in Ciara's best interest for a majority of the day (explaining why the case on her is weak, voting the counterwagon) despite not having a townread on the slot. And then, when Ciara is in trouble beyond trouble, you suddenly make sure that you are seen supporting the wagon (by declaring a third hammer intent when it <div style=\"display:inline;font-style:italic\">really</div> wasn't necessary and talking about declaring an intent to hammer before others did despite not saying anything about it in thread), which are exactly the type of interactions I expect to be happening from at least one scum.<br>\n</div></blockquote><br>\n<br>\nI realize the timing may seem convenient, but it was not a sudden conversion.  By the time Ciara was at L-1, I would have gone with either a Karmic or a Ciara lynch, but the fact that Ciara was at L-1 and the day was drawing to a close was why I expressed the intent to hammer.  Yes, it was not necessary since 2 other people had already expressed intent, but I just wanted to make sure we got a lynch.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote cite=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7245592#p7245592\"><div><cite> <a href=\"./viewtopic.php?p=7245592#p7245592\" data-post-id=\"7245592\" onclick=\"if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash\">In post 523</a>,  <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=11658\">Nachomamma8</a> wrote:</cite><br>\nWhat points did you like from Thor that made the wagon more appealing than before?

(Bella - feel free to argue against this)<br>\n<br>\nSilverwolf's rolecop claim on Dave is painfully obv. - there is no doubt in my mind that Dave is a jailkeeper.<br>\nNacho's claim seems...odd, but works within the concept of the dayplay I saw. It seems like an unlikely scum gambit to go with when there are that many other claimed PRs though. (Garmr - if you can describe Nacho's theory way of winning in your mind - that would be swell).<br>\nOdds assuredly favor both Silver and Pistach not being both town.<br>\nRadja's claim also seems unlikely to come from scum, I'll admit.<br>\n<br>\nSmart money play seems to be lynch one of the rolecops.<br>\nIf we get a scum flip - JKer gets the Doc protection.<br>\nCop investigates someone.<br>\nRolecop checks Bella (or someone?).<br>\nJailkeeper jails someone (Bella?).<br>\n<br>\nEh, probably just makes sense to jail someone else and rolecop Bella. That way scum have to kill an investigative or Nacho - and with a kill whomever the jailkeeper is on is basically confirmed town. So, no matter what, we walk out of that day with two additional confirmed town.<br>\n<br>\nIf we lynch a town rolecop what would be the best play?<br>\n<br>\nJailkeeper jails someone. <br>\nDoc on Cop.<br>\nCop on someone.<br>\n<br>\nThat seems to make the most sense.<br>\n<br>\nI think a big question becomes the chance of scum shooting Bella vs. Thor. Scum either shot one of us, or Bella is scum (or, maybe, paranoia theory - Nacho is fakeclaim Doc from scum faction who no killed for hijinks to out PRs...wear your aluminum hats as needed).<br>\n<br>\nI'm mildly torn on the rolecop question.<br>\nPistach, functionally, claimed under pressure.<br>\nThere is almost no doubt that they are both rolecops though - so already the setup is a little screwy and we know it. <br>\n@Mod -  <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_igmeou.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":igmeou:\" title=\"IGMEOU\">", "time": "Sun Sep 27, 2015 7:14 am", "page": "https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=63235&start=625", "forum": "53", "thread": "63235"}

Sure the town cop/tracker I could understand but a jailkeeper/roleblocker why would he want to know why they were in the game the answer is simple.<br>\n<br>\nScum targeted bella to die and not thor.  Thor was pretty obvious town at that point in the game so if town had watchers/trackers they would probably go watch him and if town had a doctor they would most likely protect thor. Thus the pretty much out of the box bella vote would make sense for someone trying to find who the jailkeeper by peoples reactions because lets admit it who would doc bella over thor. I nearly forgot the fact he didn't say watcher because he was probably only concerned about the people on him to see if his fake claim would stand up. <br>\n<br>\nAlso add in the fact that nacho claimed doctor last out of all the roles because it was the safest time to fake claim it. Not only will this stop him being a jailkeeper target but it would make most town hesitant to lynch him as well. The claim he protected thor night 1 wouldn't be a bad idea as town but that's only assuming scum want to take a risk of being caught by a power role. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\nThe no kill can be explained by nacho being scum as well. Since the talk of godfathers and stuff was about he was probally gambling on us lynching the jailed today as he that the point he was pushing all day by pushing the fact we should lynch who we jail this would get him off a lynch today.

He was useful this game because scum opted to try to kill one of the more obvious town players, and the Doc also thought said player was fairly obvious.<br>\nThe roleblocker exists as a strong counter to the investigative powers, as he prevents massclaim shenanigans as long as he is alive - losing him first was a massive blow to scum wincon.<br>\n<br>\nSo, functionally, town had a cop who could find 2/3 of the scumteam.<br>\nA different cop who could find 2/3 of the scumteam and had a weak claim against lynching.<br>\nA weak protective role (Doc)<br>\nAnd a strong protective role with late game investigative powers.<br>\nvs.<br>\nOne of the strongest scum defensive roles (GF)<br>\nArguably one of the best scum roles in the game barring odd ones that don't appear often (roleblocker)<br>\nAnd a scum role that is of middle tier but tends to be considered higher tier when paired with an RBer (rolecop)<br>\n<br>\nWhere I think the setup is unbalanced is, I think giving town a rolecop and scum a rolecop is a little wonky - I'd rather see town net a tracker, for similar effect and a very slightly less powerful ability, and see the JKer shifted to a full 'Alien' JKer just to allow scum a bit of wiggle room there. That said, I don't actually think either change is needed for balance.<br>\n<br>\nThe problem with this game is that, literally, the scum's best tool to control town was lynched Day 1. That is the begining and the end of why the scum team burst into flames so quickly - give us even a different scum lynch and it wouldn't have been so damaging. Give us a town lynch nd scum could have been in a grand position Day 2. Which, in essence, means that the game is not unbalanced - an unbalanced game would allow town to gak 1-2 lynches early and *still* have scum on their back heel.
