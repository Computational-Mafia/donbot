If you need to talk to me, please do it via private message, not in the game thread.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">4. Text must be default size, unencrypted &amp; unhidden (means no spoiler tags).</span><br>5. No provable randomization, &amp; please keep RVS to a minimum. Play with a purpose.<br>6. This should go without saying: Do not talk about ongoing games. Bad form, Hook.<br>7. Only the mafia faction are permitted to discuss this game outside the game thread.<br>8. The mafia factional topic will only be available for discussion during night phase.<br>9. Do not edit or delete posts, if you have moderation powers. Very bad form, Hook.<br>10. Do not directly quote role PMs, mod PMs, private topics or other out-of-game stuff.<br>11. Do not reveal players' alt accounts, if you know their mains. Extremely bad form.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">12. Votes that do not use the site voting tags (i.e. <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: zakk</span>) will not count.</span><br>13. Lynches (and No Lynch) require simple majority (greater than 50%) to go through.<br>14. Until a player's role and alignment are flipped they may continue to talk in-thread. <br><span class=\"noboldsig\">15. After you flip, don't talk any more. Not even a \"bah\" post. #sorrynotsorry</span><br>16. Any posts made by accounts not signed up to the game, will be deleted on sight.<br>17. Deadlines will last 14 days for each day phase, and 3 days for each night phase.<br>18. If no lynch is reached, or no action is submitted before deadline, none will occur. <br>19. Prods (I shouldn't need to send any prods) will be sent after 48 hours of inactivity.<br>20. Not answering prods in 48 hours = replacement. Three prods also = replacement.<br><span class=\"noboldsig\">21. Any V/LA extending longer than 48 hours (not weekends) = replacement.</span><br>22. Replacements in night phase merit a deadline extension regardless of alignment.<br>23. Deadline extensions may also occur at my discretion, under other circumstances.<br>24. Have fun!

You quoted the questions I asked you in post 125.<br><br>I call BS on the plausible deniability angle you are pushing cause nobody should ever take my own word for it and my ability is easily searchable by looking at my past games. To save you some time  I can tell you what you'd find if you did that. The game I played with nacho (just basing off memory) that's the game where I was under pressure late game and I was able to keep focused and scum gave up and admitted defeat. That explains why nacho probably thinks I'm a good player cause I basically won that game. You'll also find 2 games where I claimed prematurely day 1 and ended up hurting town in both games, II think town lost both those games also and I never got to use my roles. The other games don't really stand out in my mind so I'd have to do skim.those again. <br><br>I don't see why me being honest about my ability bothers anyone, have I once tried to use that as an excuse? No, would I expect people to let me get away with it if I tried? Absolutely not. So you are suspicious of me for a null issue. Why not find something actually scummy?  there's people who have done things that fit that criteria. Like a person lying about another person when the evidence is clearly visible to say otherwise. Or a player who accused another player of something based of an assumption rather than taking the time to find out the actual reasons for their vote?<br><br>If you are town, do better. If you are scum, carry on, I'll figure out which eventually"}

One of the biggest flaws in peoples' mafia games is mistaking laziness for scumminess. <br><br>Ciara seems like she's here and reading, but not doing specially great scumhunting. That (and also sheeping Thor, I thought that was implicit) is why I'm voting Ciara.<br><br>The Woody wagon (god, even the name is perfect - like those old wood-paneled station wagons? Did Woody pick his name for this pun? If so, much respect) still a good wagon. Reading his last completed town game did give me a lot of information. He was also pretty aggressive in that game, though his posts seemed to be more earnest scumhunting. His posts in this game, some of his posts have felt like a pretense of activity to me. What Thor said about Ciara \"attacking, not scumhunting\" applies to Woody as well.<br><br>I am totally fine with a D1 Woody lynch. I just didn't want to spend all D1 tunneling the same person. I've made my case against Woody. His counter-argument has been that I'm wrong, humorless, and can't read, so I was getting pretty tired of that. Even if Woody flips VT, I stand by him as a good lynch candidate. He's interacted with a lot of people, and offers good D2 info on Nacho, Gramr, pistachi0n, and Bellaphant.<br><br>TL;DR - I'm sheeping Thor, but it's because I agree with him, not blindly sheeping. Fine with Ciara or Woody lynch. I'm just in the mood to run somebody up to L2 and see what they have to say."}

Woody strikes me as Town, mainly because he is actively scumhunting and propelling the discussion forward without super aggressive tunnelling.

Woody strikes me as Town, mainly because he is actively scumhunting and propelling the discussion forward without super aggressive tunnelling.  That being said, I wouldn't call Karmic's \"immediate unvote\" argument lying.  At best it's a misunderstanding; at worst it's trying to see what accusations stick.

Thor's play seems weird.

Everything in a D1 thread is either bullcrap or bad news to them, so walls are really annoying.<br><br>3.) I don't know what the whole \"what do you think of nacho???\" thing was, but I don't like that when Thor asked you basically the same question, you said \"yes.\" As in, you have a valid opinion of him, but aren't sharing it yet. You did eventually elaborate by saying that you thought he was scum, changed your mind, and are mad at him for not spotting an SK in a previous game. (A ridiculous thing to be mad at someone for.) I kind of don't buy any of that. At the very least, it's flip-floppy.<br><br>To further expound on this... if you're scumhinting, you'd share your opinion of him, one way or the other. If you're hunting for Town PR's, however, and think Nacho is something, that would explain the \"yes\" with no follow up.<br><br>4.) The more I read over this game, it's a lot of you saying \"I like this\" and \"I don't like this.\" When you do explain yourself, you do a reasonably good job, but those explanations are few and far between, and peppered with character assassination.</div></blockquote><br>Ciara wasn't contributing enough to town? That's a big change in things from lurking and lol at the time ciara had a decent amount of posts. So that isn't really even a reason. Your stretching more than a gym instructor in yoga pants. It feels liek you were just trying to find a reason why to place your vote on the wagon.<br><br><br>1.Well it was a serious vote coming out of rvs and I wanted some pressure on that slot as I didn't understand why people (thor and nacho) were instantly town reading it and I found that bit really quirky as I found newbie scum trying to do this before. Once the game progressed I felt better about the slot.<br><br>2.Town shouldn't read walls on page 2 and 3 when there's pretty much nothing to go but rvs who the fuck makes walls out of rvs posts and a question about why did you vote me. I could pretty much say what thor was saying in one easy to read paragraph which I did. I know thor he makes a novel out of a page and thankfully he did cut down on the walls a bit so that makes me happy.<br><br>3. I was going to answer thors question anyway so me fucking around with thor a bit is all in good fun for me.You don't fucking know what I lost in that game. I lost a friend who never talks to me anymore and pretty much ignored any attempt to patch things up with her after that game. That game was a pretty emotional game and nacho can attest to that. Also you accusing me of role hunting which is almost a big of stretch as your lurker thing. your really reaching for this.<br><br>4.) I have trouble with words sometimes but I eventually do get it right. But I have pretty much explained everything I have said and like you have said I have done a pretty good job. Also saying that i use character Assassination as to undermine my the fact my points are pretty valid is pretty shit lol. I can be extremely snarky as town or scum so me making snide remarks about someone (I try to keep them tame and about in game content only so i don't get banned again) is pretty bad.<br><br>Seriously I think your inexperienced with scum. Throwing stuff out which doesn't make sense if you look at it a little closer. Throwing wild accusation like his role hunting and trying to tell his scum team he thinks nacho is a role through I tend to role hunt as town as well which I can provide examples for but I wasn't role hunting here ;/ and finally changing oh she's lurking into oh she hasn't produced much content is very different and both are very wrong.<br><br>So what we have you doing here is Backtracking,mudthrowing,reaching,Finding a excuse to jump on the lead wagon there's a plethora of reasons why you are scum."}

Posting a lot of nonsense is a good way to make yourself harder to PBPA later, makes lazy people who look at postcount in a few IRL days think you're town, and generally obfuscates what the town is trying to do. It's a valid thread to tug on, and I'm tugging on it.<br><br>The way I feel right now, you seem as nervous as someone at L2, and you're not at L2. I can tell you hate this attention. You wanted to be the carefree jokester townie who shocks everyone by turning out to be scum all along, and you're pissed at how fast that's falling apart.</div></blockquote><br>Karmic's approach to the early game, as explained in this post, seems to be cutting down on behavior that he considers to be anti-town and endorsing pro-town behavior. I think this is the most logical approach you can take to early game, and thus, while I don't consider his argument against Woody to be particularly strong, I do think that the approach makes sense and I don't mind the reaching argument here as a result. <br><br>The bottom paragraph about what he thinks Woody is doing here would be a surprisingly deep thought process for scum at this point in the game; instead of focusing heavily on surface-level interactions as scum do oh so often, he's explaining what he thinks Woody's mindset is at this point in time and why he is making the posts he's making as scum. The assertions also aren't exactly unsupported; I think saying that Woody started the game as a \"carefree jokester\" and then took a darker tone when pressured is completely accurate, although I don't think it means the same thing that Karmic thinks it does.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7208501#p7208501\" class=\"postlink\">post 142</a>, KarmicGuide wrote:</cite>Ciara seems like she's here and reading, but not doing specially great scumhunting. That (and also sheeping Thor, I thought that was implicit) is why I'm voting Ciara.</div></blockquote><br>This statement has gotten a bit of heat (in fact, this is why there's a wagon on Karmic if I'm not mistaken), but I disagree very strongly that this was ill-intentioned or even incorrect. There's no way in hell that anyone playing this game can look me in the face that Ciara has made any sort of significant impact in the game at all; she has no major stances, hasn't pushed scumreads, hasn't formed townreads. Postcount means something, but it isn't much; what matters is opinions formed and how they are pushed and she doesn't really have any of those."}

You can argue that there is no scumhunting due to lurking - but that in and of itself is a valid case for Day 1.<br><br>Meanwhile your favored wagon is a wagon based on \"flawed arguments and not using valid tells\" which, as far as I can grok, equates to either a case of 'not scumhunting' or 'scumhunting so poorly he must be scum'.

Also while I agree that we want a reply to the L-1 situation, we can't just wait forever.  I think we have a decent chance of catching scum with this wagon.  The main reason we would move off it would be if there were a credible PR claim.  This late in the day, getting cold feet on the absent player and a mad dash to another is a really bad idea.

Maybe replace out soon, if you aren't up to doing more than prod-dodging.<br><br>Garmr = IDK, I'm conflicted.

Maybe she's just busy, but even when she was here, she always seemed afraid to post confident opinions.<br><br>It's not an airtight wagon, no. It's a gutread, plus some supporting evidence.

However, rather than scumhunting, you choose to instead go for a \"compromise lynch\" out of deadline fears. Of particular note is your choice of Karmic as a \"stronger town read\" - this seems to indicate that you have a weaker town read on Ciara, or at least, don't think she is scum (supported by how you \"don't like\" it.)<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7230920#p7230920\" class=\"postlink\">post 410</a>, pistachi0n wrote:</cite><br>The two wagons are between Karmic and Ciara.

In your ISO, You have NOT stated that Karmic is your only town read, only that Karmic is your strongest, and in the context of voting Ciara, a \"stronger town read\" (stronger than who? reading it seems to imply than Ciara is a town read too as stated earlier, clarify if I'm misinterpreting please.)

I really enjoy how you are taking my posts out of context - especially on escalating my views on Ciara wagon into defending Ciara. Really, really do. I also enjoy how everyone is rehashing my case on pista and using it to attack him, but presenting it as new evidence that they are discovering on their own. Did any of you even bother reading my case? <br><br>Silverwolf, you list my <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7232663#p7232663\">434</a> as hopping on Pista and not liking pista's reasons for voting and use it to justify me as avoiding the Ciara wagon and defending her, and trying to get a different wagon. In that post, I've posted an entire case complete with lovely quotes on why I feel pistachi0n is scummy and worth looking into - points which all of you seem to agree with. I also a soft hammer/vote intent in the last line - that I'm happy to hop onto any of the other wagons if there's a danger of nolynch, and that Ciara is 1 away from lynch (with 3 hammer intents to boot on her - unstated by me in the post though) - I'm happy to come back and hammer her if everyone else disappears before deadline. How is stating this defending her? Is this scum repeating a lie until it becomes truth? Or did you just not read my post? <br><br>Also, right above, you quote Gimlear's points on pista, then below you do a quick summary of his actions and the reasons for you voting him. BOTH of these - Gimlear's points, and most of your points on pista, have long been stated in my <a class=\"postlink post_tag\" href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=7232663#p7232663\">434</a>. Yet, both of you, and pretty much the rest of the playerbase, INCLUDING pistachi0n himself, have been ignoring my case and are instead trying to paint me as scummy, but yet reuse the same points to attack pistachi0n. Again, have you even read my post before using it to accuse me? This is rubbish. I'm happy with you and many people putting suspicion on me for lack of activity, for I did lurk and flake and have rightfully earned that suspicion. Even pushing the Karmic wagon - that was a veiled prod dodge and also a poke to see what reactions I'd get (spoiler alert: I flaked after that, so I never read any of it). But defending Ciara? Avoiding her wagon? That's nonsense. <br><br>In other news, especially in the light of yesterday's flip and pistachi0n not addressing any points on him, I'm happy to <span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: pistachi0n</span>.

Regardless, I third the intent to hammer on Ciara.</div></blockquote><br>This post is a pretty good representation of a couple of the problems I have with your interactions with Ciara. For one, you always seem to be acting in Ciara's best interest for a majority of the day (explaining why the case on her is weak, voting the counterwagon) despite not having a townread on the slot. And then, when Ciara is in trouble beyond trouble, you suddenly make sure that you are seen supporting the wagon (by declaring a third hammer intent when it <span style=\"font-style: italic\">really</span> wasn't necessary and talking about declaring an intent to hammer before others did despite not saying anything about it in thread), which are exactly the type of interactions I expect to be happening from at least one scum.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7233864#p7233864\" class=\"postlink\">post 444</a>, Gimlear wrote:</cite>@Radja: While I was initially wary of Thor for pushing the Ciara wagon so hard so early, I'm getting a much better town vibe from him now that he has explained his thought processes.</div></blockquote><br>What points did you like from Thor that made the wagon more appealing than before?

Gim ends up defending Ciara without defending her for a majority of the day; he calls the wagon on her weak, he prods at the wagon's main aggressor. I thought that the way that he limited his options to Ciara/Karmic when he wasn't really hyped about either wagon was to increase Ciara's chance of survival; it doesn't make sense to me for him to focus on those two wagons and those two wagons only for any other reason. I also thought that his shift away from Thor was unnatural; I don't think Thor's reasons for lynching Ciara changed significantly throughout the day and so Gimlear not being sold by the Ciara case until it looked like Ciara was a dead woman walking and then suddenly being moved seems fishy to me."}

A bit behind on reading and I'm tired and about to go to sleep. The rolecop claim by pistach has me raising my eyebrows, but her carelessness in doing so at L-3 on your provocation (when she's actually at L-3) actually lines up with her actions and makes it more believable that she didn't check properly and did genuinely believe she should claim. Also that claim is a rather weird one - rolecop with a rolecop on another rolecop seems too weird to be a fakeclaim and an odd gambit to make. Question is, is pistach town? Or is she just careless scum?<br><br>Silverwolf I'm starting to dislike now because of her blatant mis-repping of my day 1 play, and sheeping the things I've said (with added clarity from the Day 1 flip) to vote pistach but yet turning around and using those same reasons to accuse me of defending Ciara and avoiding a wagon. <br>It feels to me that that may be stretching a bit to create scumreads as scum who can't seem to find things to push. Waiting for her to post again and also respond to pistach's rolecop on her, am considering moving my vote to her. Probably warrants an <span class=\"noboldsig\">FoS</span>.<br><br>Of course, it doesn't quite make much sense for both to be Mafia, this would be a seriously weird WIFOMMY bussing gambit, especially with their Roleblocker dead.  Also realising that pistach's role claim (early one too) could be a calculated one to disguise a vote back on Silverwolf as with reason rather than an OMGUS (don't know how sound this reasoning is, feel free to tell me it's stupid if it is.) But the nice thing is, if they are both really rolecops, pistach has locked herself in - if we choose to lynch Silverwolf and she flips Town or anything but rolecop, we can lynch pistach and most likely hit scum. If Silverwolf flips scum role cop, pistach probably eats the Nightkill (as Radja should be under whoever's protective role) and we can direct her - and if she lives too long, she may be bussing scum and we can lynch her. Does this make sense, and is this why you are happy?<br><br>I'm a little more unsure on pistach now, but I won't unvote first before Silverwolf posts, as I doubt there are more than 2 scum left in this game, making it rather unlikely that she will be quickhammered."}

The original vote on Karmic started as a sheep of Garmr once Garmr actually explained his reasons, but I continued to poke at Thor and the reasons for the Ciara wagon.  I was never actually defending Ciara so much as not understanding the reasons behind the wagon.  I even stated in my discussions with Thor that my read on Ciara at the time was null, not town.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7245592#p7245592\" class=\"postlink\">post 523</a>, Nachomamma8 wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7230963#p7230963\" class=\"postlink\">post 415</a>, Gimlear wrote:</cite>This is a valid point, which is why I was considering an intent to hammer on Ciara before the others already did it.  Regardless, I third the intent to hammer on Ciara.</div></blockquote><br>This post is a pretty good representation of a couple of the problems I have with your interactions with Ciara. For one, you always seem to be acting in Ciara's best interest for a majority of the day (explaining why the case on her is weak, voting the counterwagon) despite not having a townread on the slot. And then, when Ciara is in trouble beyond trouble, you suddenly make sure that you are seen supporting the wagon (by declaring a third hammer intent when it <span style=\"font-style: italic\">really</span> wasn't necessary and talking about declaring an intent to hammer before others did despite not saying anything about it in thread), which are exactly the type of interactions I expect to be happening from at least one scum.<br></div></blockquote><br><br>I realize the timing may seem convenient, but it was not a sudden conversion.  By the time Ciara was at L-1, I would have gone with either a Karmic or a Ciara lynch, but the fact that Ciara was at L-1 and the day was drawing to a close was why I expressed the intent to hammer.  Yes, it was not necessary since 2 other people had already expressed intent, but I just wanted to make sure we got a lynch.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7245592#p7245592\" class=\"postlink\">post 523</a>, Nachomamma8 wrote:</cite>What points did you like from Thor that made the wagon more appealing than before?

At that point I felt like the reasons for the Ciara wagon were vague and not well defined.

I would think a town doctor would mention that in his search because he would want to avoid being pinned as the the town doctor. To further push the point he knew bella was targeted he votes bella in this post as well. He mention a town jailkeeper/roleblocker but why would he mention that if he is town doctor. Sure the town cop/tracker I could understand but a jailkeeper/roleblocker why would he want to know why they were in the game the answer is simple.<br><br>Scum targeted bella to die and not thor.  Thor was pretty obvious town at that point in the game so if town had watchers/trackers they would probably go watch him and if town had a doctor they would most likely protect thor. Thus the pretty much out of the box bella vote would make sense for someone trying to find who the jailkeeper by peoples reactions because lets admit it who would doc bella over thor. I nearly forgot the fact he didn't say watcher because he was probably only concerned about the people on him to see if his fake claim would stand up. <br><br>Also add in the fact that nacho claimed doctor last out of all the roles because it was the safest time to fake claim it. Not only will this stop him being a jailkeeper target but it would make most town hesitant to lynch him as well.

However, I had low towncred at that point, so you might have gotten away with it and my raging dismissed and swallowed up in the thread (like every one of my other posts).

He was useful this game because scum opted to try to kill one of the more obvious town players, and the Doc also thought said player was fairly obvious.<br>The roleblocker exists as a strong counter to the investigative powers, as he prevents massclaim shenanigans as long as he is alive - losing him first was a massive blow to scum wincon.<br><br>So, functionally, town had a cop who could find 2/3 of the scumteam.<br>A different cop who could find 2/3 of the scumteam and had a weak claim against lynching.<br>A weak protective role (Doc)<br>And a strong protective role with late game investigative powers.<br>vs.<br>One of the strongest scum defensive roles (GF)<br>Arguably one of the best scum roles in the game barring odd ones that don't appear often (roleblocker)<br>And a scum role that is of middle tier but tends to be considered higher tier when paired with an RBer (rolecop)<br><br>Where I think the setup is unbalanced is, I think giving town a rolecop and scum a rolecop is a little wonky - I'd rather see town net a tracker, for similar effect and a very slightly less powerful ability, and see the JKer shifted to a full 'Alien' JKer just to allow scum a bit of wiggle room there. That said, I don't actually think either change is needed for balance.<br><br>The problem with this game is that, literally, the scum's best tool to control town was lynched Day 1. That is the begining and the end of why the scum team burst into flames so quickly - give us even a different scum lynch and it wouldn't have been so damaging. Give us a town lynch nd scum could have been in a grand position Day 2. Which, in essence, means that the game is not unbalanced - an unbalanced game would allow town to gak 1-2 lynches early and *still* have scum on their back heel. That was not the case in this setup."}

We only have so much time before deadline and I'm going to be working all day tomorrow as well.<br><br>    I have read through the game and some individual ISO's and I'd like to break up the obtown bloc of Thor, Nacho, Garmr. Not only are they obvious town but clearly very skilled at the game as well. Thor practically confirmed himself as town with the Ciara push. As a side note, I'm pretty irritated that Ciara played the way she did and ended up getting up to L-1 and basically disappeared from the game entirely and refused to replace out. I think if she would of stuck around and defended herself or a replacement would of come in and been able to do so, the lynch could of been avoided. It was a tough situation for me replacing in to find you both wagoned. I do appreciate WW towning up this slot and when I read you, I would be townreading you if I was playing this game as town. That's pretty much what I do as scum. I treat my partners like I would any other player. If you do something scummy, I'll call you on it. If you look townie, I'll say so. I'll question you like anyone else. I'd expect you to do the same with me. Otherwise, you get those pesky associative tells if one of us flips.<br><br>    Anyway, The RC/kill should be within these 3. I didn't see any obvious PR signs from anyone so instead I'm going to just go by play. There is a chance one of these three is protected but my take on that is, it's still worth it to try. I've gone back and forth between Thor or Nacho for the kill. I actually really want to play with these two and Garmr as well but I can't make decisions based on that. Thor and Garmr kind of butt heads so that might create some noise/distraction. Nacho will never be lynched. A Garmr kill might make you look bad and I like how he has my slot as one of his top 3. Garmr comes off as really, really confident. Like he knows he will not be lynched no matter what. My thought is either Nacho kill and Garmr RC or Nacho RC and Thor kill. This is where I was hoping to get your input because you've been playing this game since the beginning and might of seen something I did not.</div></blockquote><br><br><br><br>I don't think Garmr is that obvs town, I feel like we can break him.<br><br>Also, sorry for my inactivity here. I'm absolutely on board with talking, I just haven't had a good time to reply to this yet.<br><br>I'm glad you're here, but man, Woody replacing out really screwed with my head. My plan was to bus him really hard, and hope that Nacho felt Woody was town. I wanted to really dissuade anyone from suspecting a Woody/Karmic scumteam.<br><br>Now, I'm not really sure if I got anywhere from that... you're sort of still Woody, but you also sort of aren't.<br><br>You've got a lot of good thought here, and I agree with it in general. Yeah, I need to learn to never type up those broad everyone-included townread lists. They never get me anywhere. I think I can back out of it by saying that I thought they were bad Day 1 lynches, not necessarily bad lynches. Which is exactly how I feel.<br><br>Yeah, IDK what Bella's deal is. Proddodge with a little extra, seems like. Same with Eventi and Dave. There are a lot of anemic players in this game, and I don't know how to handle anemic players.</div></blockquote><br><br><br><img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\"> I was a suggested night kill I didn't know how praised I was lol. Also newer scum always think they can lynch me and it tends to backfire on them so nah. If i was a cop I would of probably investigated eventi or dave and left you alone to push a lynch on you. Also lapping silverwolfs praise <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\">. You just said eventi could be a good assist to town ect in thread yet you call him anemic in the scum thread busted <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\">"}
